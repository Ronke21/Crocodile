<text>In computer networking, specifically Internet Relay Chat (IRC), netsplit is a disconnection between two servers. A split between any two servers splits the entire network into two pieces.

==Cause and effects==

Consider the graph to the right, which represents the computer network. Each line represents an established connection. Therefore, the server &quot;C&quot; is connected directly to &quot;A&quot;, which is also connected to &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D&quot;.

If a disruption in the connection between &quot;C&quot; and &quot;A&quot; occurs, the connection may be terminated as a result. This can occur either by a socket producing an error, or by excessive lag in which the far server &quot;A&quot; anticipates this case (which is called a timeout).

When the connection between &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot; is severed, users who were connected to other servers that are no longer reachable on the network appear to quit. For example, if user &quot;Sara&quot; is connected to server &quot;A&quot;, user &quot;Bob&quot; is connected to server &quot;B&quot;, and user &quot;Joe&quot; is connected to &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; splits, or disconnects, from &quot;A&quot;, it will appear to &quot;Joe&quot; as if &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; both quit (disconnected from the network), and it will appear to both &quot;Sara&quot; and &quot;Bob&quot; that &quot;Joe&quot; quit. 
However, &quot;Joe&quot; can still talk to anyone who is connected to the same server (in this case server &quot;C&quot;).
This happens because the servers to which they are connected are informed of the change in the network status, and update their local information accordingly to display the change.

Later, server &quot;C&quot; may relink (reconnect) to a server (or servers) on the network and the users who appeared to have quit will rejoin; the process of sending this updated information to all servers on the network is called a netburst (or sync).

==Security issues==
Occasionally, users will attempt to use netsplits to gain access to private channels. A denial-of-service attack can be used to cause a netsplit by overloading an IRC server&#x27;s network connection or Internet infrastructure between two servers. If none of the channel users were on server C, a user could join a private channel and later gain access when the servers relink. This is commonly known as &quot;split riding&quot; or &quot;riding the split&quot;.

Another typical netsplit-oriented IRC attack is Nickname Colliding. In this attack, a user on a split segment of the network would change nicknames to that of a user on the other side of the split network. Upon reconnection, the network would disconnect both users because only one nickname may be in use at one time. Modern IRC server software has largely eliminated this method, but servers using older software may still be vulnerable.

==Appearance==
Below are examples of a typical netsplit. When two servers split, a user sees this as large number of users quitting. After the servers are reconnected, a user sees the other users rejoining.

===On GUI IRC clients===
* usera has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net)
* userb has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net)
* userc has quit (a.irc.net b.irc.net)
* usera has joined #channel
* userb has joined #channel
* userc has joined #channel
===On command-line client IRC===

00:00 -!- Netsplit a.irc.net &lt;-&gt; b.irc.net quits: usera, userb, userc
00:00 -!- Netsplit over, joins: usera, userb, userc
===To a user on a private network===

* usera has quit (*.net *.split)
* userb has quit (*.net *.split)
* userc has quit (*.net *.split)
* usera has joined #channel
* userb has joined #channel
* userc has joined #channel

<doc id="674274" wikidata="Q456026" url="?curid=674274" title="Vascular resistance">
<text>Vascular resistance is the resistance that must be overcome for blood to flow through the circulatory system. The resistance offered by the systemic circulation is known as the systemic vascular resistance or may sometimes be called by another term total peripheral resistance, while the resistance caused by the pulmonary circulation is known as the pulmonary vascular resistance. Vasoconstriction (i.e., decrease in the diameter of arteries and arterioles) increases resistance, whereas vasodilation (increase in diameter) decreases resistance. Blood flow and cardiac output are related to blood pressure and inversely related to vascular resistance.

==Measurement==

The measurement of vascular resistance is challenging in most situations. The standard method is by the use of a Pulmonary artery catheter. This is common in ICU settings but impractical is most other settings.

==Units for measuring==
Units for measuring vascular resistance are dyn·s·cm−5, pascal seconds per cubic metre (Pa·s/m3) or, for ease of deriving it by pressure (measured in mmHg) and cardiac output (measured in L/min), it can be given in mmHg·min/L. This is numerically equivalent to hybrid resistance units (HRU), also known as Wood units (in honor of Paul Wood, an early pioneer in the field), frequently used by pediatric cardiologists. The conversion between these units is:

formula_1

==Calculation==
In the hydraulic version of Ohm&#x27;s law, sometimes called Ohm’s law of fluid flow, vascular resistance is analogous to electrical resistance, the pressure difference is analogous to the electrical voltage difference, and volumetric flow is analogous to electric current flow:

:formula_2
where
* R is resistance
* ΔP is the difference in pressure across the circulation loop (systemic / pulmonary) from its beginning (immediately after exiting the left ventricle / right ventricle) to its end (entering the right atrium / left atrium)
* Q is the flow through the vasculature (when discussing SVR this is equal to cardiac output)
===Systemic vascular resistance===
The SVR can therefore be calculated in units of dyn·s·cm−5 as

:formula_3
where the pressures are measured in mmHg and the cardiac output is measured in units of litres per minute (L/min). Mean arterial pressure is the cycle average of blood pressure and is commonly approximated as 2 x diastolic blood pressure + systolic blood pressure/3 [or diastolic blood pressure + 1/3(systolic blood pressure - diastolic blood pressure)]. Mean right atrial pressure or central venous pressure, is usually very low (normally around 4mmHg), and as a result, it is frequently disregarded.

As an example: if systolic blood pressure = 120 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure = 80 mmHg, right atrial mean pressure = 3 mmHg and cardiac output = 5 L/min, Then mean arterial pressure = 2 x diastolic pressure + systolic pressure/3 = 93.3 mmHg, and SVR = (93 - 3) / 5 = 18 Wood units, or equivalently 1440 dyn·s/cm5.

It is difficult to measure or monitor SVR in most locations outside the ICU. An invasive catheter is necessary. SVR, BP and CO are related to each other but only BP is easily measured. In the typical situation at the bedside we have an equation with three variables, one known, that is the BP and two unknown, CO and SVR. For this reason the BP is frequently used as a practical but somewhat inadequate definition of shock or the state of blood flow.

===Pulmonary vascular resistance===
The PVR can be calculated similarly (in units of dyn·s·cm−5 ) as:

:formula_4

where the units of measurement are the same as for SVR. The pulmonary artery wedge pressure (also called pulmonary artery occlusion pressure or PAOP) is a measurement in which one of the pulmonary arteries is occluded, and the pressure downstream from the occlusion is measured in order to approximate the left atrial pressure. Therefore, the numerator of the above equation is the pressure difference between the input to the pulmonary blood circuit (where the heart&#x27;s right ventricle connects to the pulmonary trunk) and the output of the circuit (which is the input to the left atrium of the heart).

==Regulation==
There are many factors that influence vascular resistance. Vascular compliance is determined by the muscle tone in the smooth muscle tissue of the tunica media and the elasticity of the elastic fibers there, but the muscle tone is subject to continual homeostatic changes by hormones and cell signaling molecules that induce vasodilation and vasoconstriction to keep blood pressure and blood flow within reference ranges.

In a first approach, based on fluids dynamics (where the flowing material is continuous and made of continuous atomic or molecular bonds, the internal friction happen between continuous parallel layers of different velocities) factors that influence vascular resistance are represented in an adapted form of the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:
:formula_5
where
* R = resistance to blood flow
* L = length of the vessel
* η = viscosity of blood
* r = radius of the blood vessel

Vessel length is generally not subject to change in the body.

In Hagen–Poiseuille equation, the flow layers start from the wall and, by viscosity, reach each other in the central line of the vessel following a parabolic velocity profile.

In a second approach, more realistic and coming from experimental observations on blood flows, according to Thurston, there is a plasma release-cell layering at the walls surrounding a plugged flow. It is a fluid layer in which at a distance δ, viscosity η is a function of δ written as η(δ), and these surrounding layers do not meet at the vessel centre in real blood flow. Instead, there is the plugged flow which is hyperviscous because holding high concentration of RBCs. Thurston assembled this layer to the flow resistance to describe blood flow by means of a viscosity η(δ) and thickness δ from the wall layer.

The blood resistance law appears as R adapted to blood flow profile :

:formula_6 
where
* R = resistance to blood flow
* c = constant coefficient of flow
* L = length of the vessel
* η(δ) = viscosity of blood in the wall plasma release-cell layering
* r = radius of the blood vessel
* δ = distance in the plasma release-cell layer

Blood resistance varies depending on blood viscosity and its plugged flow (or sheath flow since they are complementary across the vessel section) size as well, and on the size of the vessels.

Blood viscosity increases as blood is more hemoconcentrated, and decreases as blood is more dilute. The greater the viscosity of blood, the larger the resistance will be. In the body, blood viscosity increases as red blood cell concentration increases, thus more hemodilute blood will flow more readily, while more hemoconcentrated blood will flow more slowly.

Counteracting this effect, decreased viscosity in a liquid results in the potential for increased turbulence. Turbulence can be viewed from outside of the closed vascular system as increased resistance, thereby countering the ease of flow of more hemodilute blood. Turbulence, particularly in large vessels, may account for some pressure change across the vascular bed.

The major regulator of vascular resistance in the body is regulation of vessel radius. In humans, there is very little pressure change as blood flows from the aorta to the large arteries, but the small arteries and arterioles are the site of about 70% of the pressure drop, and are the main regulators of SVR. When environmental changes occur (e.g. exercise, immersion in water), neuronal and hormonal signals, including binding of norepinephrine and epinephrine to the α1 receptor on vascular smooth muscles, cause either vasoconstriction or vasodilation. Because resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of vessel radius, changes to arteriole diameter can result in large increases or decreases in vascular resistance.

If the resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of vessel radius, the resulting force exerted on the wall vessels, the parietal drag force, is inversely proportional to the second power of the radius. The force exerted by the blood flow on the vessel walls is, according to the Poiseuille equation, the wall shear stress. This wall shear stress is proportional to the pressure drop. The pressure drop is applied on the section surface of the vessel, and the wall shear stress is applied on the sides of the vessel. So the total force on the wall is proportional to the pressure drop and the second power of the radius. Thus the force exerted on the wall vessels is inversely proportional to the second power of the radius.

The blood flow resistance in a vessel is mainly regulated by the vessel radius and viscosity when blood viscosity too varies with the vessel radius. According to very recent results showing the sheath flow surrounding the plug flow in a vessel, the sheath flow size is not neglectible in the real blood flow velocity profile in a vessel. The velocity profile is directly linked to flow resistance in a vessel. The viscosity variations, according to Thurston, are also balanced by the sheath flow size around the plug flow. The secondary regulators of vascular resistance, after vessel radius, is the sheath flow size and its viscosity.

Thurston, as well, shows that the resistance R is constant, where, for a defined vessel radius, the value η(δ)/δ is constant in the sheath flow.

Vascular resistance depends on blood flow which is divided into 2 adjacent parts : a plug flow, highly concentrated in RBCs, and a sheath flow, more fluid plasma release-cell layering. Both coexist and have different viscosities, sizes and velocity profiles in the vascular system.

Combining Thurston&#x27;s work with the Hagen-Poiseuille equation shows that blood flow exerts a force on vessel walls which is inversely proportional to the radius and the sheath flow thickness. It is proportional to the mass flow rate and blood viscosity.

:formula_7 
where
* F = Force exerted by blood flow on vessel walls
* Q = Volumetric flow rate
* c = constant coefficient of flow
* L = length of the vessel
* η(δ) = dynamic viscosity of blood in the wall plasma release-cell layering
* r = radius of the blood vessel
* δ = distance in the plasma release-cell layer or sheath flow thickness

===Other factors===
Many of the platelet-derived substances, including serotonin, are vasodilatory when the endothelium is intact and are vasoconstrictive when the endothelium is damaged.

Cholinergic stimulation causes release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) (later it was discovered that EDRF was nitric oxide) from intact endothelium, causing vasodilation. If the endothelium is damaged, cholinergic stimulation causes vasoconstriction.

Adenosine most likely does not play a role in maintaining the vascular resistance in the resting state. However, it causes vasodilation and decreased vascular resistance during hypoxia. Adenosine is formed in the myocardial cells during hypoxia, ischemia, or vigorous work, due to the breakdown of high-energy phosphate compounds (e.g., adenosine monophosphate, AMP). Most of the adenosine that is produced leaves the cell and acts as a direct vasodilator on the vascular wall. Because adenosine acts as a direct vasodilator, it is not dependent on an intact endothelium to cause vasodilation.

Adenosine causes vasodilation in the small and medium-sized resistance arterioles (less than 100 μm in diameter). When adenosine is administered it can cause a coronary steal phenomenon, where the vessels in healthy tissue dilate more than diseased vessels. When this happens blood is shunted from potentially ischemic tissue that can now become ischemic tissue. This is the principle behind adenosine stress testing. Adenosine is quickly broken down by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red cells and the vessel wall. The coronary steal and the stress test can be quickly terminated by stopping the adenosine infusion.

==Systemic==
A decrease in SVR (e.g., during exercising) will result in an increased flow to tissues and an increased venous flow back to the heart. An increased SVR, as occurs with some medications, will decrease flow to tissues and decrease venous flow back to the heart. Vasoconstriction and an increased SVR is particularly true of drugs the stimulate alpha(1) adrenergic receptors.

==Pulmonary==
The major determinant of vascular resistance is &quot;small arteriolar&quot; (known as resistance arterioles) tone. These vessels are from 450 μm down to 100 μm in diameter (as a comparison, the diameter of a capillary is about 5 to 10 μm). Another determinant of vascular resistance is the &quot;pre-capillary arterioles&quot;. These arterioles are less than 100 μm in diameter. They are sometimes known as autoregulatory vessels since they can dynamically change in diameter to increase or reduce blood flow.

Any change in the viscosity of blood (such as due to a change in hematocrit) would also affect the measured vascular resistance.

Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) also depends on the lung volume, and PVR is lowest at the functional residual capacity (FRC). The highly compliant nature of the pulmonary circulation means that the degree of lung distention has a large effect on PVR. This results primarily due to effects on the alveolar and extra-alveolar vessels. During inspiration, increased lung volumes cause alveolar expansion and lengthwise stretching of the interstitial alveolar vessels. This increases their length and reduces their diameter, thus increasing alveolar vessel resistance. On the other hand, decreased lung volumes during expiration cause the extra-alveolar arteries and veins to become narrower due to decreased radial traction from adjacent tissues. This leads to an increase in extra-alveolar vessel resistance. PVR is calculated as a sum of the alveolar and extra-alveolar resistances as these vessels lie in series with each other. Because the alveolar and extra-alveolar resistances are increased at high and low lung volumes respectively, the total PVR takes the shape of a U curve. The point at which PVR is the lowest is near the FRC.

==Coronary==
The regulation of tone in the coronary arteries is a complex subject. There are a number of mechanisms for regulating coronary vascular tone, including metabolic demands (i.e. hypoxia), neurologic control, and endothelial factors (i.e. EDRF, endothelin).

Local metabolic control (based on metabolic demand) is the most important mechanism of control of coronary flow. Decreased tissue oxygen content and increased tissue CO2 content act as vasodilators. Acidosis acts as a direct coronary vasodilator and also potentiates the actions of adenosine on the coronary vasculature.

<text>Glanmire () is a suburban town from Cork city centre, in the civil parish of Rathcooney, County Cork, Ireland. Glanmire is within the administrative area of Cork City Council and the Dáil constituency of Cork North-Central.
The greater Glanmire area encompasses the communities of Riverstown (Baile Roisín), Brooklodge (Cill Ruadháin) and Sallybrook (Sruthán na Saileach).

== History ==
Glanmire&#x27;s history dates to Early Christian Ireland, with the nearby church site at Rathcooney in use since 1291. The stone bridge located in Riverstown dates to c.1760. At the parish church located on a hill above the village, Sarah Curran, lover of the hanged Robert Emmet, married Captain Henry Sturgeon in 1805.

In the 1800s Glanmire was a small yet industrialised village with woolen factories and mills lining the banks of the river Glashaboy.

The town expanded substantially in the late 20th century. Originally administered by Cork County Council, in 2019 Glanmire, as part of the boundary expansion of the city, was brought within the administrative area of Cork City Council.

== Education ==
There are six primary schools serving the Glanmire area. These include Scoil na nÓg (An Irish Language, boarding and day boarding Primary School, founded in 1958), Scoil Naomh Micheál (Saint Michael&#x27;s - Upper Glanmire), Scoil Naomh Iosaf (Saint Joseph&#x27;s - Riverstown), Scoil Chill Ruadháin (Brooklodge Primary School), New Inn and Gaelscoil Uí Drisceoil which opened in 2006.

Glanmire has two secondary schools. Glanmire Community College (GCC), established in 1997, is located on a twelve-acre site. Coláiste an Phiarsaigh, opened in 1973, is located in Glanmire Village. It has around 550 students - both day students and weekly boarders. Coláiste an Phiarsaigh is part of the Gaelachas Teoranta Organisation.

== Irish language ==
There are several Irish language schools in the Glanmire area, with approximately 300 pupils attending the Gaelscoil (primary) and 550 in the Gaelcholáiste (secondary). Gaelachas Teoranta also hosts residential summer courses in Irish, and there is a &quot;mini-Gaeltacht&quot; in Ard Bharra whose founders include musician Tomás Ó Canainn. &quot;The Miller of Glanmire&quot; is a jig named for the town.

== Churches ==
Glanmire Parish extends from midway on Tivoli dual carriageway to within three miles of Watergrasshill, thence to White&#x27;s Cross via Templemichael.

There are two Catholic churches in the Glanmire: Saint Michael&#x27;s church in Upper Glanmire and St Joseph&#x27;s in Riverstown. St. Michael&#x27;s was dedicated and reopened for worship in 1808 following restructuring. The bi-centenary of this church was celebrated in 2008, and a special Mass of Thanksgiving was celebrated with Bishop John Buckley as principal celebrant. St. Joseph&#x27;s is the Glanmire Parish Church and was dedicated in 1837. Both St. Joseph&#x27;s and St. Michael&#x27;s are built on or near the sites of pre-penal times churches.

==Notable people==

* Billy Kelleher, Member of the European Parliament
* Teddy McCarthy, Gaelic footballer and hurler
* David G. O&#x27;Connell, Auxiliary Bishop of Los Angeles

<doc id="674288" wikidata="Q1088452" url="?curid=674288" title="This Is Where I Came In">
<text>This Is Where I Came In is the twenty-second and final studio album by the Bee Gees. It was released on 2 April 2001 by Polydor in the UK and Universal in the US, less than two years before Maurice Gibb died from a cardiac arrest after surgery to repair a twisted intestine.
It is the only album of all-new material released by them on the Universal Music label (which had acquired the rights to the group&#x27;s releases on Polydor Records when they bought that label&#x27;s parent PolyGram). The album peaked at No. 6 in the UK, while the single, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;, reached No. 18. In the US, the album peaked at No. 16. The group appeared on the A&amp;E concert series &quot;Live by Request&quot; in April 2001 to promote the new album.

The brothers saw the album as a return to the original Bee Gees formula as well as a new beginning. The album marked the fifth decade of recording for the band. It was one of the first Bee Gees albums to be re-released on Reprise Records in 2006, when the brothers regained the rights to all of their recordings.

==Background==
The album features main vocals from all three of the brothers, and employs a variety of musical styles. &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; recalls the rock theme more commonly found on 1960s Bee Gees songs. &quot;She Keeps on Coming&quot; and &quot;Voice in the Wilderness&quot; have strong rock themes, while &quot;Sacred Trust&quot;, &quot;Just in Case&quot; and &quot;Wedding Day&quot; continue the Bee Gees&#x27; trend for love songs. Maurice plays the Epiphone guitar given to him by John Lennon on &quot;She Keeps On Coming&quot; Two of Robin&#x27;s songs, &quot;Embrace&quot; and &quot;Promise The Earth&quot; are Europop dance songs, while Barry&#x27;s &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot; is an exception to the rule, as it is an homage to the typical 1930s Tin Pan Alley melody. Maurice Gibb provides lead vocals for two songs, &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; and &quot;Walking on Air&quot;. In the United Kingdom, two bonus tracks were published, &quot;Just in Case&quot; and &quot;Promise the Earth&quot; as well as other countries issued the album with 14 tracks.

===Recording===
One song in the album, &quot;Sacred Trust&quot; was recorded in early 1998 in Miami Beach. Around 1999, the Bee Gees recorded &quot;I Will Be There&quot; but only as a demo as they sent it to Tina Turner and she recorded it for her album &quot;Twenty Four Seven&quot; that same year. Maurice Gibb was busy producing songs for the band Luna Park. Also in 1999, three new Barry Gibb compositions &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;, &quot;Loose Talk Costs Lives&quot; and &quot;Voice in the Wilderness&quot; were recorded as well as four new Maurice Gibb compositions, but only &quot;Walking on Air&quot; and &quot;Man in the Middle&quot; were released. Also in 1999, the new Robin Gibb composition, &quot;Embrace&quot; was recorded. In October that year, the group recorded &quot;Wedding Day&quot;. The next year 2000, the group recorded five more songs including the title track, &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot;.

<text>Ansegisel (c. 602 or 610 – murdered before 679 or 662) was the younger son of Saint Arnulf, bishop of Metz.

==Life==
He served King Sigebert III of Austrasia (634–656) as &quot;domesticus&quot;. He was killed sometime before 679, slain in a feud by his enemy Gundewin. Through his son Pepin, Ansegisel&#x27;s descendants would eventually become Frankish kings and rule over the Carolingian Empire. 
==Marriage and issue==
He was married to Begga, the daughter of Pepin the Elder, sometime after 639. They had the following children: 
* Pepin the Middle (635 or 640 – December 16, 714), who would later become Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia
* Martin of Laon (647 - 680) (though this is disputed)
* Clotilda of Herstal (650–699), married King Theuderic III of Neustria

<text>The border wall along the Mexico–United States border is intended to reduce illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico. The barrier is not a continuous structure but a series of obstructions variously classified as &quot;fences&quot; or &quot;walls&quot;.

Between the physical barriers, security is provided by a &quot;virtual fence&quot; of sensors, cameras, and other surveillance equipment used to dispatch United States Border Patrol agents to suspected migrant crossings. In May 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it had of barriers in place. A total of of new primary barriers were built during Donald Trump&#x27;s first presidency, dubbed the &quot;Trump wall&quot;, though Trump had repeatedly promised a &quot;giant wall&quot; spanning the entire border. The national border&#x27;s length is , of which is the Rio Grande and is on land.

On July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings. In October 2023, Biden announced that he was restarting wall construction on some parts of the border due to the surge of migrant crossings, constructing an additional 20 miles of border wall. On January 20, 2025, re-elected President Donald Trump pledged to finish the wall during his second term.

== Description ==
The border between the U.S. and Mexico traverses a variety of terrain, including urban areas and deserts. The border from the Gulf of Mexico to El Paso, Texas, follows the Rio Grande, a natural barrier. The barrier is on both urban and uninhabited sections of the border, where the most illegal crossings and drug trafficking have been observed in the past. These urban areas include San Diego, California, and El Paso, Texas. The fencing includes a steel fence (varying in height between 18 and 27 feet (4.8 and 8.1 meters)) that divides the border towns of Nogales, Arizona, in the U.S. and Nogales, Sonora, in Mexico.

97% of border apprehensions (foreign nationals caught in the U.S. illegally) by the Border Patrol in 2010 occurred at the southwest border. The number declined 61% from 1,189,000 in 2005 to 723,842 in 2008 to 463,000 in 2010. The decrease in apprehensions is the result of numerous factors, including changes in U.S. economic conditions and border enforcement efforts. Border apprehensions in 2010 were at their lowest level since 1972. Total apprehensions for 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 415,517, 521,090, and 977,509, respectively. And while the barrier is along the border with Mexico, 80% of those apprehended are not Mexican.

As a result of the barrier, the number of people trying to cross in areas that have no fence, such as the Sonoran Desert and the Baboquivari Mountains in Arizona, has increased. Such immigrants must cross 50 miles (80 km) of inhospitable terrain to reach the first road, which is in the Tohono Oʼodham Indian Reservation.

== Geography ==
The Mexico–U.S. border stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Gulf of Mexico in the east. Border states include the Mexican states of Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas and the U.S. states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
== History ==
===Origins===
Territorial exchanges in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) and the Gadsden Purchase (1853) largely established the current U.S.–Mexico border. Until the early 20th century, the border was open and largely unpatrolled, with only a few &quot;mounted guards&quot; patrolling its length. But tensions between the U.S. and Mexico began to rise with the Mexican Revolution (1910) and World War I, which also increased concerns about weapons smuggling, refugees and cross-border espionage. The first international bridge was the Brownsville &amp; Matamoros International Bridge, built in 1910. The first barrier built by the U.S. (a barbed-wire fence to prevent the movement of cattle across the border) was built in Ambos Nogales between 1909 and 1911, and was expanded in 1929 with a &quot;six foot–high chain-link fence&quot;. The first barrier built by Mexico was likely a -tall wire fence built in 1918 explicitly for the purpose of directing the flow of people, also in Ambos Nogales. Barriers were extended in the following decades, and became a common feature in border towns by the 1920s. In the 1940s, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service built chain-link barriers along the border.

The U.S. Congress approved a $4.3 million request by Immigration and Naturalization Service, in 1978, to build a fence along the border to replace an existing fence near San Ysidro, California, and El Paso, Texas, and then build an additional of new fence. Anchor Post Products was contracted to build the new fence in a project inherited from Richard Nixon, who was the first president to propose building a border fence. The proposed construction received press coverage after the company&#x27;s George Norris, described the fence as a &quot;razor-sharp wall&quot;, leading to negative responses in Mexico. The proposed wall, dubbed the &quot;Tortilla Curtain&quot; by critics, was condemned by Mexican politicians such as then-president José López Portillo, and it was raised as an issue during President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s state visit to Mexico in February 1979. Fencing was ultimately constructed, but had a limited length and did not have razor wire.

U.S. president George H. W. Bush approved the initial 14 miles (22.5 km) of fencing along the San Diego–Tijuana border. In 1993, President Bill Clinton oversaw initial border fence construction which was completed by the end of the year. Starting in 1994, further barriers were built under Clinton&#x27;s presidency as part of three larger operations to taper transportation of illegal drugs manufactured in Latin America and immigration: Operation Gatekeeper in California, Operation Hold-the-Line in Texas, and Operation Safeguard in Arizona. Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which authorized further barriers and the reinforcement of the initial border fence. The majority of the border barriers built in the 1990s were made out of leftover helicopter landing mats from the Vietnam War.

=== Bush administration (2001–2009)===

The Real ID Act, signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 11, 2005, attached a rider to a supplemental appropriations bill funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which went into effect in May 2008:Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall have the authority to waive all legal requirements such Secretary, in such Secretary&#x27;s sole discretion, determines necessary to ensure expeditious construction of the barriers and roads.

In 2005, there were of fencing along the border. In 2005, the border-located Laredo Community College obtained a fence built by the United States Marine Corps. The structure led to a reported decline in border crossings on to the campus. U.S. Representative Duncan Hunter of California proposed a plan on November 3, 2005, calling for the construction of a reinforced fence along the entire United States–Mexico border. This would also have included a border zone on the U.S. side. On December 15, 2005, Congressman Hunter&#x27;s amendment to the Border Protection, Anti-terrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005 (H.R. 4437) passed in the House, but the bill did not pass the Senate. This plan called for mandatory fencing along of the -long border. On May 17, 2006, the U.S. Senate proposed the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611), which would include of triple-layered fencing and a vehicle fence, but the bill died in committee.

====Secure Fence Act of 2006====


The Secure Fence Act of 2006, signed into law on October 26, 2006, by President George W. Bush authorized and partially funded the potential construction of of physical fence/barriers along the Mexican border. The bill passed with supermajorities in both chambers. Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff announced that an eight-month test of the virtual fence he favored would precede any construction of a physical barrier.

The government of Mexico and ministers of several Latin American countries condemned the plans. Governor of Texas Rick Perry expressed his opposition, saying that the border should be more open and should support safe and legal migration with the use of technology. The barrier expansion was opposed by a unanimous vote by the Laredo, Texas, City Council. Laredo Mayor Raul G. Salinas said that the bill would devastate Laredo. He stated &quot;These are people that are sustaining our economy by forty percent, and I am gonna close the door on them and put [up] a wall? You don&#x27;t do that. It&#x27;s like a slap in the face.&quot; He hoped that Congress would revise the bill to better reflect the realities of life on the border.

Secretary Chertoff exercised his waiver authority on April 1, 2008, to &quot;waive in their entirety&quot; the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the National Historic Preservation Act to extend triple fencing through the Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve near San Diego.
By January 2009, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security had spent $40 million on environmental analysis and mitigation measures aimed at blunting any possible adverse impact that the fence might have on the environment. On January 16, 2009, DHS announced it was pledging an additional $50 million for that purpose, and signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Interior for utilization of the additional funding. In January 2009, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that it had more than of barriers in place.

=== Obama administration (2009–2017)===
On March 16, 2010, DHS announced that there would be a halt to expand the virtual fence beyond two pilot projects in Arizona. Contractor Boeing Corporation had numerous delays and cost overruns. Boeing had initially used police-dispatching software that was unable to process all of the information coming from the border. The $50 million of remaining funding would be used for mobile surveillance devices, sensors, and radios to patrol and protect the border. At the time, DHS had spent $3.4 billion on border fences and had built of fences and barriers as part of the Secure Border Initiative.

In May 2011, President Barack Obama stated that the wall was &quot;basically complete&quot;, with of 652 planned miles of barrier constructed. Of this, vehicle barriers comprised and pedestrian fence . Obama stated that:We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement. All the stuff they asked for, we&#x27;ve done. But ... I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. They&#x27;ll want a higher fence. Maybe they&#x27;ll need a moat. Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They&#x27;ll never be satisfied. And I understand that. That&#x27;s politics.

The Republican Party&#x27;s 2012 platform stated that &quot;The double-layered fencing on the border that was enacted by Congress in 2006, but never completed, must finally be built.&quot; The Secure Fence Act&#x27;s costs were estimated at $6 billion, more than the Customs and Border Protection&#x27;s entire annual discretionary budget of $5.6 billion. The Washington Office on Latin America noted in 2013 that the cost of complying with the Secure Fence Act&#x27;s mandate was the reason that it had not been completely fulfilled.

A 2016 report by the Government Accountability Office confirmed that the government had completed the fence by 2015. A 2017 report noted that &quot;In addition to the of primary fencing, [Customs and Border Protection] has also deployed additional layers of pedestrian fencing behind the primary border fencing, including of secondary fencing and of tertiary fencing.&quot;

===First Trump administration (2017–2021)===
Throughout his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump called for the construction of a much larger and fortified border wall, claiming that if elected, he would &quot;build the wall and make Mexico pay for it&quot;. Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto maintained that his country would not pay for the wall. On January 25, 2017, the Trump administration signed Executive Order 13767, which formally directed the U.S. government to begin attempting to construct a border wall using existing federal funding, although construction did not begin at this time because a formal budget had not been developed.

Trump&#x27;s campaign promise has faced a host of legal and logistical challenges since. In March 2018, the Trump administration secured $1.6 billion from Congress for projects at the border for existing designs of approximately of new and replacement walls. From December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019, the federal government was partially shut down because of Trump&#x27;s declared intention to veto any spending bill that did not include $5 billion in funding for a border wall.

On May 24, 2019, federal Judge Haywood Gilliam in the Northern District of California granted a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from redirecting funds under the national emergency declaration issued earlier in the year to fund a planned wall along the border with Mexico. The injunction applies specifically to money the administration intended to allocate from other agencies and limits wall construction projects in El Paso and Yuma. On June 28, Gilliam blocked the reallocation of $2.5 billion of funding from the Department of Defense to the construction of segments of the border wall categorized as high priority by the Trump administration (spanning across Arizona, California and New Mexico). The decision was upheld five days later by a majority in the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court but was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court on July 26. On September 3, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper authorized the use of $3.6 billion in military construction funding for of the barrier. The House and Senate have twice voted to terminate Trump&#x27;s emergency declaration, but the president vetoed both resolutions. In October, a lawsuit filed in El Paso County produced a ruling that the emergency declaration was unlawful, as it fails to meet the National Emergencies Act&#x27;s definition of an emergency. On December 10, a federal judge in the case blocked the use of the funding, but on January 8, 2020, a federal appeals court granted a stay of the ruling, freeing $3.6 billion for the wall.

, the Trump administration&#x27;s barrier construction had been limited to replacing sections that were in need of repair or outdated, with of replacement wall built in the Southwest since 2017. As of September 12, 2019, the Trump administration plans for &quot;Between 450 and 500 miles (724–806 kilometers) of fencing along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,218-kilometer) border by the end of 2020&quot; with an estimated total cost of $18.4 billion. Privately owned land adjacent to the border would have to be acquired by the U.S. government to be built upon.

On June 23, Trump visited Yuma, Arizona, for a campaign rally commemorating the completion of of the wall. U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that almost all of this was replacement fencing. By the end of Trump&#x27;s term on January 21, 2021, had been built at last report by CBP on January 5, much of it replacing outdated or dilapidated existing barriers.

====Contractors and independent efforts====
As of February 2019, contractors were preparing to construct $600 million worth of replacement barriers along the south Texas Rio Grande Valley section of the border wall, approved by Congress in March 2018. In mid-April 2019, former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach visited Coolidge, Arizona, to observe a demonstration by North Dakota&#x27;s Fisher Industries of how it would build a border fence. The company maintained that it could erect of the barrier for $3.3 billion and be able to complete it in 13 months. Spin cameras positioned atop the fence would use facial-recognition technology, and underground fiber optic cables could detect and differentiate between human activity, vehicles, tunneling, and animals as distant as away. The proposed barrier would be constructed with near Yuma and near Tucson, Arizona, near El Paso, Texas, and near El Centro, California—reportedly costing $12.5 million per mile ($7.8 million per kilometer). In April 2019, U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy said that he traveled with the group of politicians and administration officials over the Easter recess to Coolidge ( north of the Mexico border) because he felt that insufficient barrier and border enhancements had been erected since Trump became president. U.S. senator Kevin Cramer was also there, promoting Fisher Industries, which demonstrated the construction of a fence in Coolidge.

A private organization founded by military veteran Brian Kolfage called &quot;We Build the Wall&quot; raised over $20 million beginning in 2018, with President Trump&#x27;s encouragement and with leadership from Kobach and Steve Bannon. Over the 2019 Memorial Day weekend, the organization constructed a to &quot;weathered steel&quot; bollard fence near El Paso on private land adjoining the U.S.–Mexico border using $6–8 million of the donated funds. Kolfage&#x27;s organization says it has plans to construct further barriers on private lands adjoining the border in Texas and California. On December 3, 2019, a Hidalgo County judge ordered the group to temporarily halt all construction because of its plans to build adjacent to the Rio Grande, which a lawyer for the National Butterfly Center argues would create a flooding risk. On January 9, 2020, a federal judge lifted an injunction, allowing a construction firm to move forward with the project along the Rio Grande. This ended a month long court battle with both the Federal Government and the National Butterfly Center which both tried to block construction efforts.

===Biden administration (2021–2025)===
President Joe Biden signed an executive order on his first day of office, January 20, 2021, ordering a &quot;pause&quot; in all construction of the wall no later than January 27. The government was given two months to plan how to spend the funds elsewhere and determine how much it would cost to terminate the contracts. There were no plans to tear down parts of the wall that have been built. The deployment of 3,000 National Guard troops along the border continued. Furthermore, the Biden administration continued to seize land for construction of the border wall. By December 2021, many contracts had been cancelled, including one requiring the possession of the land of a family represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project.

In June 2021, Texas governor Greg Abbott announced plans to build a border wall in his state, saying that the state would provide $250 million and that direct donations from the public would be solicited. On June 29, the Republican Study Committee organized a group of two dozen Republican House members to visit a gap in the border where Central Americans were crossing into the country. Representative Mary Miller stated that &quot;obviously our president has advertised this and facilitated this invasion&quot;. Rep. Jim Banks praised the effectiveness of Trump&#x27;s wall and said that because of the halted construction, &quot;thousands of migrants [pass] through this area on a regular basis ... because there&#x27;s an open door that allows them to do that&quot;. In reference to wristbands on migrants used by Mexican cartels and smugglers to track them, Rep. Madison Cawthorn stated, &quot;They&#x27;re basically treating people like Amazon products. ... There is no care that that is a human being, someone who has a soul, someone who has unalienable rights that predate any government.&quot;

On July 28, 2022, the Biden administration announced it would fill four wide gaps in Arizona near Yuma, an area with some of the busiest corridors for illegal crossings.

In October 2023, Biden announced he is restarting wall construction due to the surge of migrant crossings, while White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden believes that the border wall is &quot;not effective&quot;. In order to expedite production, the Biden Administration will be waiving more than two dozen laws that &quot;protect air, water and endangered species&quot; such as the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. The administration claimed that the money for the wall construction was &quot;allocated during Trump&#x27;s term in 2019.&quot; In 2021, the congress controlled by the Democratic Party ignored Biden&#x27;s request to rescind the funds. The decision was praised by former president Donald Trump and criticized by Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as &quot;a step backwards&quot; and Jonathan Blazer, director of border strategies for the American Civil Liberties Union as &quot;doubling down on the failed policies of the past.&quot;

==== Binational River Park ====
In 2021, in collaboration with the United States and Mexican ambassadors, as well as businessmen, a binational park was proposed along the Rio Grande between the border towns of Laredo, Texas, and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Supported by the No Border Wall Coalition, the park aims to create a shared recreational space instead of a border wall. Earthjustice estimated that the decision to not build a border wall in Laredo saved of river from destruction and over $1 billion in taxpayer dollars.
==== Arizona container wall ====
In August 2022, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey ordered the erection of a makeshift wall of shipping containers on the border with Mexico in Cochise County, Arizona. The construction began in the Coronado National Forest without authorization from the U.S. Forest Service, which operates the land. Ecologists at the Center for Biological Diversity argue that the construction, which imperils at-risk species including the ocelot and jaguar, violates the Endangered Species Act of 1973 and have sued to halt its construction. Governor-elect Katie Hobbs stated that she would remove the containers after taking office, and the U.S. Justice Department sued the state to remove the containers and &quot;compensate the [U.S.] for any actions it needs to take to undo Arizona&#x27;s actions&quot;. Deconstruction of the container wall had begun by January 2023.

=== Second Trump administration (2025–present)===
Trump has stated that during his second administration he will finish construction on the border wall. In January 2025, he declared a national emergency to direct the departments of State and Defense to resume construction of the wall.

==Controversy==

===Effectiveness===
Research at Texas A&amp;M University and Texas Tech University indicates that the wall, like border walls in general, is unlikely to be effective at reducing illegal immigration or movement of contraband. In mid-April 2019, U.S. Senator Martha McSally said that a barrier will not resolve the border crisis. Authors of books on the effectiveness have said that aside from the human crossings, drugs among other things will still be making their way to the United States illegally. However, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has frequently called for more physical barriers on the Mexico–United States border, citing their efficacy. Smugglers in 2021 used demolition tools and power saws on pieces of wall in Arizona.

===Divided Native American land===

Tribal lands of three Native American reservations are divided by a proposed border fence.

On January 27, 2008, a Native American human rights delegation in the United States, which included Margo Tamez (Lipan Apache-Jumano Apache) and Teresa Leal (Opata-Mayo) reported the removal of the official International Boundary obelisks of 1848 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Las Mariposas, Sonora-Arizona sector of the Mexico–U.S. border. The obelisks were moved southward approximately , onto the property of private landowners in Sonora, as part of the larger project of installing the steel barrier wall.

The proposed route for the border fence would divide the campus of the University of Texas at Brownsville into two parts, according to Antonio N. Zavaleta, a vice president of the university. There have been campus protests against the wall by students who feel it will harm their school. In August 2008, UT-Brownsville reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the university to construct a portion of the fence across and adjacent to its property. On August 20, 2008, the university sent out a request for bids for the construction of a high barrier that incorporates technology security for its segment of the border fence project. The southern perimeter of the UT-Brownsville campus will be part of a laboratory for testing new security technology and infrastructure combinations. The border fence segment on the campus was substantially completed by December 2008.

The SpaceX South Texas Launch Site was shown on a map of the Department of Homeland Security with the barrier cutting through the in Boca Chica, Texas.

=== Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge ===
On August 1, 2018, the chief of the Border Patrol&#x27;s Rio Grande Valley sector indicated that although Starr County was his first priority for a wall, Hidalgo County&#x27;s Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge had been selected instead for initial construction, because its land was owned by the government.

=== National Butterfly Center ===
The proposed border wall has been described as a &quot;death sentence&quot; for the American National Butterfly Center, a privately operated outdoor butterfly conservatory that maintains a significant amount of land in Mexico. Filmmaker Krista Schlyer, part of an all-woman team creating a documentary film about the butterflies and the border wall, &quot;Ay Mariposa&quot;, estimates that construction would put &quot;70 percent of the preserve habitat&quot; on the Mexican side of the border. In addition to concerns about seizure of private property by the federal government, center employees have also noted the local economic impact. The center&#x27;s director has stated that &quot;environmental tourism contributes more than $450m to Hidalgo and Starr counties.&quot;

In early December 2018, a challenge to wall construction at the National Butterfly Center was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. According to the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, &quot;the high court let stand an appeals ruling that lets the administration bypass 28 federal laws&quot;, including the Endangered Species Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.

===Mexico&#x27;s condemnations===
In 2006, the Mexican government vigorously condemned the Secure Fence Act of 2006. Mexico has also urged the U.S. to alter its plans for expanded fences along their shared border, saying that it would damage the environment and harm wildlife. 

In 2012, Enrique Peña Nieto was campaigning in Tijuana at the Playas de Monumental, less than from the U.S.–Mexico border adjacent to Border Field State Park. In one of his speeches he criticized the U.S. government for building the barriers and asked for them to be removed, referencing President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s &quot;Tear down this wall!&quot; speech from Berlin in 1987.

=== Migrant deaths ===

Between 1994 and 2007, there were around 5,000 migrant deaths along the Mexico–United States border, according to a document created by the Human Rights National Commission of Mexico, also signed by the American Civil Liberties Union. Between 43 and 61 people died trying to cross the Sonoran Desert from October 2003 to May 2004; three times that of the same period the previous year. In October 2004, the Border Patrol announced that 325 people had died crossing the entire border during the previous 12 months. Between 1998 and 2004, 1,954 persons are officially reported to have died along the Mexico–U.S. border. Since 2004, the bodies of 1,086 migrants have been recovered in the southern Arizona desert.

U.S. Border Patrol Tucson Sector reported on October 15, 2008, that its agents were able to save 443 illegal immigrants from certain death after being abandoned by their smugglers. The agents also reducing the number of deaths by 17% from 202 in 2007 to 167 in 2008. Without the efforts of these agents, hundreds more could have died in the deserts of Arizona. According to the same sector, border enhancements like the wall have allowed the Tucson Sector agents to reduce the number of apprehensions at the borders by 16% compared with 2007.

===Environmental impact===

In April 2008, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to waive more than 30 environmental and cultural laws to speed construction of the barrier. Despite claims from then Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff that the department would minimize the construction&#x27;s impact on the environment, critics in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, asserted that the fence endangered species and fragile ecosystems along the Rio Grande. Environmentalists expressed concern about butterfly migration corridors and the future of species of local wildcats, the ocelot, the jaguarundi, and the jaguar.

By August 2008, more than 90% of the southern border in Arizona and New Mexico had been surveyed. In addition, 80% of the California–Mexico border has been surveyed. About 100 species of plants and animals, many already endangered, are threatened by the wall, including the jaguar, ocelot, Sonoran pronghorn, Mexican wolf, a pygmy owl, the thick-billed parrot, and the Quino checkerspot butterfly. According to Scott Egan of Rice University, a wall can create a population bottleneck, increase inbreeding, and cut off natural migration routes and range expansion.

In 2008 a resolution &quot;based on sound and accurate scientific knowledge&quot; expressing opposition to the wall and the harmful impact on several rare, threatened, and endangered species, particularly endangered mammals such as the jaguar, ocelot, jaguarondi, and Sonoran pronghorn, was published by The Southwestern Association of Naturalists, an organization of 791 scientists specializing in the zoology, botany, and ecology of southwestern United States and Mexico. A decade later in 2018, well over 2500 scientists from 43 countries published a statement opposing the Border Wall, affirming it will have &quot;significant consequences for biodiversity&quot; and &quot;Already-built sections of the wall are reducing the area, quality, and connectivity of plant and animal habitats and are compromising more than a century of binational investment in conservation.&quot;

An initial wall for which U.S. funding has been requested on the nearly border would pass through the Tijuana Slough National Wildlife Refuge in California, the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge and Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Texas, and Mexico&#x27;s Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site that the U.S. is bound by global treaty to protect. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection plans to build the wall using the Real ID Act to avoid the process of making environmental impact statements, a strategy devised by Chertoff during the Bush administration. Reuters said, &quot;The Real ID Act also allows the secretary of Homeland Security to exempt CBP from adhering to the Endangered Species Act&quot;, which would otherwise prohibit construction in a wildlife refuge.

== Polling ==

A Rasmussen Reports poll from August 19, 2015, found that 51% supported building a wall on the border, while 37% opposed.

In a January 2017 study conducted by the Pew Research Center, 39% of Americans identified construction of a U.S.–Mexico border wall as an &quot;important goal for U.S. immigration policy&quot;. The survey found that while Americans were divided by party on many different immigration policies, &quot;the widest [partisan split] by far is over building a southern border wall. Two-thirds of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (67%) say construction of a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border is an important goal for immigration policy, compared with just 16 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners.&quot;

A survey conducted by the National Border Patrol Council found that 89% of border patrol agents said a &quot;wall system in strategic locations is necessary to securing the border&quot;. 7% of agents disagreed.

A poll conducted by CBS on June 21 and 22, 2018, found that 51% supported the border wall, while 48% opposed.

A poll conducted by the Senate Opportunity Fund in March of 2021 found that 53% supported finishing construction of the border wall, while 38% opposed.

<text>Saint Begga (also Begue, Beghe, Begge) (615 – 17 December 693) was the daughter of Pepin of Landen, mayor of the palace of Austrasia, and his wife Itta. She is also the grandmother of Charles Martel, who is the grandfather of Charlemagne.

==Life==
The daughter of Pepin of Landen and his wife, Itta, Begga was the older sister of St Gertrude of Nivelles. She married Ansegisel, son of Arnulf, Bishop of Metz, and had Pepin of Heristal and Martin of Laon. Ansegisel was killed sometime before 679, slain in a feud by his enemy Gundewin. Begga made a pilgrimage to Rome and upon her return, she took the veil, she had seven churches built at Andenne on the Meuse. There she spent the rest of her days as abbess. She was buried in Saint Begga&#x27;s Collegiate Church in Andenne.

==Veneration==
She is commemorated on 17 December.

Some hold that the Beguine movement which came to light in the 12th century was actually founded by St Begga; and the church in the beguinage of Lier, Belgium, has a statue of St Begga standing above the inscription: &quot;St. Begga, our foundress&quot;. The Lier beguinage dates from the 13th century.

Another popular theory, however, claims that the Beguines derived their name from that of the priest Lambert le Bègue, under whose protection the witness and ministry of the Beguines flourished.

<text>Weston Lullingfields is a village in Shropshire, England. It is located about 15 km north west of Shrewsbury. The population as taken at the 2011 census can be found under Baschurch.

==Etymology==
The village name &#x27;Weston&#x27; is a common one in England. It is Anglo Saxon in origin and means &#x27;west farm&#x27;.

==Canal==
Weston Lullingfields was a terminus of a branch of the Ellesmere Canal known as the Weston Branch. The canal was originally intended to continue on to Shrewsbury, but was never completed as intended. At Weston Lullingfields the canal company built a wharf, four lime kilns, a public house, stables, a clerk&#x27;s house and weighing machine. These were opened in 1797 and closed in 1917 when the Weston branch was closed following a breach of the canal.

<text>The fourth USS &quot;Dale&quot; (DD-353) was a &quot;Farragut&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. &quot;Dale&quot; received 14 battle stars for World War II service. She was named for American Revolutionary war hero Richard Dale.

&quot;Dale&quot; was launched 23 January 1935 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard; sponsored by Mrs. E. C. Dale; and commissioned 17 June 1935. Rear Admiral Yates Stirling Jr., commandant of the Third Naval District and the Brooklyn Navy Yard, oversaw construction and presided over the commissioning. As a fourteen-year-old boy nearly 50 years earlier, Stirling had lived aboard the first USS Dale (1839) when the old sloop-of-war, her masts removed and at the end of her long service, was the station ship at the Washington Navy Yard under his father&#x27;s command. &quot;Dale&quot; was decommissioned 16 October 1945 and sold 20 December 1946.

==Pre-World War II==

&quot;Dale&quot; made a southern cruise from 13 February to 6 March 1936, visiting Norfolk, Dry Tortugas, Florida, and Galveston, Texas, and acted as escort for President F. D. Roosevelt&#x27;s cruise in the Bahamas before departing for the west coast. She took part in fleet problems, made a good will visit to Callao, Peru, served as training ship for the gunnery school at San Diego, and cruised to Hawaii, Alaska, and the Caribbean on exercises.

On 5 October 1939, &quot;Dale&quot; departed San Diego to join the Hawaiian Detachment for training and patrol.

==Late 1941 Pearl Harbor Attack – early 1942==
At the commencement of the raid on Pearl Harbor at 0750 on 7 December 1941, the Dale was moored with ships of Destroyer Division Two at Berth X-14. The order of ships in the nest, from starboard to port, was as follows: USS Aylwin, USS Farragut, the Dale, and USS Monaghan. The ship&#x27;s head was 030, and boiler number three was in use for auxiliary purposes. The deck officer and acting commanding officer, Ensign F.M. Radel, saw the first plane attack the USS Utah from westward. General Quarters was immediately sounded, and orders were given to set material condition Affirm and light all boilers. At 0810, fire was opened on Japanese planes using the after .50-caliber machine guns, followed shortly thereafter by the after five-inch anti-aircraft guns. The ships on either side of the Dale prevented the use of the forward guns, and the forward searchlight made it impossible to bring the director to bear in the direction of the level bombing attacks. The 5-inch guns operated in local control against a squadron of level bombers flying at about 10,000 feet above the battleships, but results were poor, with shots bursting well behind and short of the targets. At 0815, an enemy dive bomber attacking the USS Raleigh from westward came under severe machine gun fire from all the ships in the nest, was struck, and crashed into the harbor.

At 0820 it was reported to the senior officer in the nest—Lieutenant Commander W.P. Burford, commanding the Monaghan—that the Dale was ready to get underway. While backing clear, a torpedo apparently aimed at the USS Raleigh passed under the bow of the Dale and exploded on Ford Island. At 0844 the Dale stopped while the Monaghan dropped depth charges against a Japanese submarine close aboard the starboard side of the USS Curtiss. The Dale then changed speed to 25 knots and proceeded out of harbor ahead of the Monaghan. Until the Dale neared the submarine net she did not come under the direct fire of the planes; apparently the Japanese wished to sink a ship in the entrance, blocking the harbor, as the Dale came under severe dive bombing and machine gun attacks near the entrance. Machine-gun fire from the ship served to keep the attackers from approaching too closely, although there were several close misses which caused no damage.

At 0907 the Dale cleared the entrance buoys. By stopping the port engine and coming hard left rudder, she caused a flight of three Japanese dive bombers to overshoot their mark. As the flight passed by the starboard side close to the water, machine-gun fire from the Dale struck the leading plane, causing it to burst into flame and crash into the water. The remaining two planes attempted to attack again, but were driven off by machine-gun fire. At 0911, the Dale established offshore patrol in sector one, changing speed to 12 knots at 0927. Due to repeated airplane attacks the ship was forced to make frequent course changes and run at high speed. High-speed wakes and depth charging from other destroyers in the vicinity rendered the sound gear practically useless.

At 1114, the USS Worden (Commander Destroyer Squadron One) sortied. The Dale formed on the Worden as third ship in column. After investigating the falsely-reported presence of three enemy transports off Barbers Point, the ships formed an inner anti-submarine screen on the USS Detroit, USS Phoenix, USS St. Louis, and USS Astoria. The Dale was assigned station nine, and the task force speed was 25 knots.

At 1410, the pinion bearings on the reduction gear of the port engine failed. An attempt was made to stay with the assigned task force, as the maximum speed obtainable with one engine was 22 knots, but the Dale fell steadily behind. The starboard engine began overheating, forcing a further reduction of speed to 10 knots. The Dale retired to southward at 1654, stopped at 1930, and lay to until 0500 the following morning attempting repairs. At dawn the Dale rendezvoused with the task force, but as full repairs to the engine were impossible without the assistance of the tender, the Dale could not maintain her assigned screening station. Instead, under orders of Commander Destroyers, Battle Force, the Dale established an offshore patrol in sector one until the entrance of Task Group 8.4.

The Dale suffered no casualties and no enemy damage during the raid on Pearl Harbor. The Japanese plane shot down by the Dale off the entrance buoys was reported to the Commanding Officer. Two other planes, both dive bombers, were claimed by members of the crew to have been shot down by the Dale.

From 14 December 1941 to 17 March 1942, The Dale screened and , covering the strikes on the Salamaua–Lae campaign area of New Guinea on 10 March. The Dale returned to Pearl Harbor on escort and training duty until 11 May when she departed for Mare Island and an overhaul. On 5 June she sailed from San Francisco, with others, to back up the task forces engaged in the Battle of Midway from 6 July to 17 August. She was assigned to convoy duty between Viti Levu, Fiji, and Efate and Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, in preparation for the assault on Guadalcanal. She covered the landings, escorted transports loaded with reinforcements to the bitterly contested island from 18 August to 21 September, then sailed to Pearl Harbor for escort and training duty until 10 November. She sailed to screen the battleships and into Pearl Harbor, continuing with the USS South Dakota to San Francisco.

==1943, Aleutians Campaign==

On 9 January 1943 &quot;Dale&quot; sailed from San Francisco for duty in Aleutian waters. She supported the occupation of Amchitka between 23 January and 19 March, patrolling and repelling attacks by the Japanese. On 22 March her group sailed to patrol west of Attu to intercept and destroy enemy shipping bound for Attu or Kiska. Four days later, the group engaged a numerically superior Japanese force screening reinforcements to Attu. In the resulting Battle of the Komandorski Islands, at one time or another &quot;Dale&quot; took all of the Japanese cruisers under fire as well as screening the damaged . The Japanese reinforcements failed to reach Attu. She screened transports and fire support ships into Attu for the assault on 11 May, then patrolled off Attu until 1 August. She joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Kiska 2 August, then screened the transports which landed men there 13 August. She joined for a reconnaissance of Rat and Buldir Islands 22 August, finding no Japanese present.

==1943-1944, Central Pacific==

Sailing from Adak 5 September 1943, &quot;Dale&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 16 September to screen the group which on 8 October fueled carriers returning from a two-day air strike on Wake. &quot;Dale&quot; trained at Pearl Harbor until 5 November. She escorted a group of LSTs to the landings on Makin of 20 November, and then sailed for the west coast.

&quot;Dale&quot; got underway from San Diego 13 January 1944 to screen carriers during the assaults on Kwajalein and Eniwetok. She served in the Marshalls on escort and patrol until 22 March, then screened TF 58 during air attacks on Palau, Yap, Ulithi and Woleai between 30 March and 1 April raids supporting the Hollandia operations from 21 to 24 April; and strikes on Truk, Satawan and Ponape from 20 April to 1 May.

==1944-45, Marianas, Philippines and Japan==

From 6 June to 30 July &quot;Dale&quot; served in the Marianas, bombarding Saipan and Guam, screening carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and supporting underwater demolition teams. Overhauled at Bremerton Navy Yard from August to October, &quot;Dale&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, and then sailed to Ulithi to join TF 38. She screened this group during Philippines invasion between 25 November and 8 December; and while the group refueled TF 38 in the South China Sea during raids on the Chinese coast, Formosa, Luzon, and Okinawa. She remained with the group during carrier strikes on Tokyo and Kobe.

&quot;Dale&quot; cruised with the logistics group on five voyages between Ulithi and the Okinawa area between 13 March 1945 and 11 June when she sailed for Leyte to join a carrier division&#x27;s screen. &quot;Dale&quot; returned to Leyte to escort a convoy to Ulithi and patrolled there until 29 July and then escorted a convoy to Okinawa.

==End of War and fate==

Anchored at Guam when the war ended, &quot;Dale&quot; escorted two ships in a convoy to a rendezvous 19 August off Japan, then sailed homeward, arriving at San Diego 7 September. Four days later, she was underway for the east coast. Arriving at New York 25 September, &quot;Dale&quot; was decommissioned 16 October 1945 and was sold 20 December 1946.

&quot;Dale&quot; received 14 battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="674329" wikidata="Q510150" url="?curid=674329" title="Method stub">
<text>A method stub is a short and simple placeholder for a method that is not yet written for production needs. Generally, a method stub contains just enough code to allow it to be used a declaration with any parameters, and if applicable, a return value. 

A method stub may be used to implement an interface that is defined but for which the implementation is not available. 

==Example==

In the following example pseudocode, the function returns a particular value even though ultimately it is supposed to read a value from a hardware source. It returns a valid value, allowing consuming code to be runnable. The function ignores the input parameter which is common for a stub.

 function ReadThermometer(Source source)
 return 28
 end function

==Related==

===Distributed computing===

In distributed computing, &quot;stub&quot; is like a mock object simulates existing code, such as a procedure on a remote machine. Such stubs can be useful in porting.

In RMI nomenclature, a stub on the client-side communicates with a skeleton on the server-side.

===Windows/DOS===

In Windows and DOS, &quot;stub&quot; is like a shim small interface code left in conventional memory by self-relocating resident drivers which move most of themselves into upper memory, the high memory area, expanded or extended memory as well as similar stubs to allow the relocated code to communicate with real-mode DOS in conjunction with DOS extenders (like DPMI, DPMS, CLOAKING or NIOS).

<doc id="674344" wikidata="Q1553851" url="?curid=674344" title="Guillaume Amfrye de Chaulieu">
<text>Guillaume Amfrye de Chaulieu (1639 – 27 June 1720), French poet and wit, was born at Fontenay, Normandy.

His father, &quot;maître des Comptes&quot; of Rouen, sent him to study at the Collège de Navarre. Guillaume early showed the wit that was to distinguish him, and gained the favor of the duke of Vendôme, who procured for him the monastery of Aumale and other benefices. Louis Joseph, Duc de Vendôme, and his brother Philippe, grand prior of the Knights of Malta in France, at that time had a joint establishment at the Temple, where they gathered around them a very gay and reckless course.

Chaulieu became the constant companion and adviser of the two princes. He made an alacrity to Poland in the suite of the marquis de Béthune, hoping to make a career for himself in the court of John Sobieski; he saw one of the Polish king&#x27;s campaigns in Ukraine, but returned to Paris without securing any advancement. Saint-Simon says that the abbé helped his patron the grand prior to rob the duke of Vendôme and that the king sent orders that the princes should take the management of their affairs from him. This account has been questioned by Sainte-Beuve, who regards Saint-Simon as a prejudiced witness.

In his later years Chaulieu spent much time at the little court of the duchesse du Maine at Sceaux. There he became the trusted and devoted friend of Mlle Delaunay, with whom he carried on an interesting correspondence. Among his poems the best known are &quot;Fontenay&quot; and &quot;La Retraite&quot;.

His works were edited with those of his friend the Marquis de La Fare in 1714, 1750 and 1774. See also CA Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot;, vol. i.; and &quot;Lettres inédites&quot; (1850), with a notice by Raymond, marquis de Bérenger.

<doc id="674353" wikidata="Q3334022" url="?curid=674353" title="Penalty shootout">
<text>The penalty shootout is a method of determining a winner in sports matches that would have otherwise been drawn or tied. The rules for penalty shootouts vary between sports and even different competitions; however, the usual form is similar to penalty shots in that a single player takes one shot on goal from a specified spot, the only defender being the goalkeeper. If the result is still tied, the shootout usually continues on a &quot;goal-for-goal&quot; basis, with the teams taking shots alternately, and the one that scores a goal unmatched by the other team is declared the winner. This may continue until every player has taken a shot, after which players may take extra shots, until the tie is broken, and is also known as &quot;sudden death&quot;.

==Rationale==
A penalty shootout is normally used only in &quot;no ties allowed&quot; situations (for example, a tournament where the losers must be eliminated) and where other methods such as extra time, sudden death, and/or the away goal rule have failed to determine a winner first. It avoids the delays involved in staging replayed matches in order to produce a tie-break. A common complaint about penalty shootouts is that they only determine the better team in the one, rather narrow, discipline of taking penalty shots, rather than fairly determining the better team in overall play.

==Sports==
Sports in which a penalty shootout may be used include:

===Association football===

Penalty shootouts, properly known as &quot;kicks from the penalty mark&quot; and a nickname of &quot;spot kicks&quot;, are used as a tie-breaking measure in many knock-out tournaments or cup competitions where matches cannot end in a draw. If scores are level after regular time and extra-time (if used), each team will alternately take penalty kicks against the opposition goalkeeper. If, after five pairs of kicks, an equal number of goals have been scored by each team the shootout proceeds to sudden death.

===Cricket===

As a tiebreaker, players from both teams take turns attempting to throw the ball at a wicket, with sudden death initiating after both teams have had five attempts. This method is no longer used in international cricket.

===Field hockey===
===Gaelic games===
Since 2010 penalty shootouts have occasionally been used to decide knockout games in the Gaelic games of hurling, Gaelic football, camogie and ladies&#x27; Gaelic football. Traditionally drawn games were settled by a replay, with extra time also being used, but fixture congestion has led to pressure for &quot;winner on the day&quot; solutions.

They were first used in some club competitions. Rules vary between tournaments, but in general five players are chosen to face the goalkeeper, who must defend the goals alone (previously, in hurling and camogie, three players defended against a penalty). In addition, only goals count: in normal play, hitting the ball over the bar and between the post scores a point ( of a goal), but this does not count in a shootout (However, there have been some contests, where points were counted in a shootout.) If the teams are still tied after five pucks or kicks, sudden death is entered, with the same five players being used for the sudden death shots.

Shootouts were used in the &quot;sevens&quot; All-Ireland in 2013 and the ladies&#x27; football Interprovincial Championships in 2014.

Alternatives to penalty shootouts include the use of free-taking shoot-outs, taken from a distance of in hurling, and or in Gaelic football, or in ladies&#x27; football. In these competitions, only points counted, with a goal counted as a miss. The GAA&#x27;s Central Council backed a move to penalty shootouts in 2018.

The first penalty shootout in an inter-county competition was when defeated in the 2020 Christy Ring Cup.

Bernard Brogan has criticised their use in Gaelic football, saying that the skill required is more appropriate to soccer, and that 45-metre kicks may be a better option. Tommy Walsh also criticised them, pointing out the increased focus brought on the individual who misses a penalty. A &quot;Killarney Advertiser&quot; poll found that 68% of fans were opposed to shootouts.

&quot;Golden score&quot; (&quot;next score wins&quot;) extra time has also been posited as an alternative. This rule was in place for the 2022 FBD Insurance League, but no games were drawn. This has an advantage over soccer&#x27;s golden goal, as in Gaelic games it is much easier to score and golden-score extra time would be unlikely to last more than a few minutes.

===Handball===
If a game is tied after regular time and a clear winner is necessary (like in knockout tournaments), it would proceed to two 5-minute periods of overtime with a 1-minute break before each. If the scores are still tied, a second overtime of 2x5 minutes is played. If the game is still tied after 2 overtimes, the game goes into a penalty shootout. Five players per side throw 7-meters-penalties, if still tied, one player per side take a penalty throw until a decision is found, which is the same procedure as in association football.

===Ice hockey===

If the score remains tied after an overtime period, the subsequent shootout consists of a set number of players from each team (3 in the NHL and IIHF rules and 5 in most North American minor leagues, and one in some other leagues) taking penalty shots. After these shots, the team with the most goals is awarded the victory. If the score is still tied, additional shots are played until one team scores and the other does not; the scoring team wins and is awarded two points in the standings, while the losing team is awarded one point. In North America, a team receives 2 points for a win in either regulation time, overtime or shootout, while the losing team receives no points for a regulation loss and one point for an overtime or shootout loss. In the NHL, the player scoring the shootout-winning goal is not officially credited with a goal in his personal statistics; thus, a player who scores twice in regulation and once in the shootout is not credited with a hat trick. On December 16, 2014, the Florida Panthers defeated the Washington Capitals 2–1 in the 20th round of a shootout, making it the longest shootout in NHL history.

In many European leagues a team receives three points for a regulation win and two for an overtime or shootout win, with the losing team&#x27;s points awarded in the same manner as in North America. Regardless of the number of goals scored during the shootout by either team, the final score awards the winning team one more goal than the score at the end of regulation time (or overtime).

In many North American minor leagues, the player that scores the shootout-winning goal is credited with one shot on goal and one goal. The losing goaltender of the shootout is credited with one shot against, one goal against, and an overtime/shootout loss. North American professional hockey does not allow shootouts in post-season play, and instead will play multiple 20-minute sudden-death overtime periods as are needed until a team scores. The official IIHF name of the procedure is game-winning shots (GWS). In some European countries, the post-game penalty shots are unofficially known as &quot;bullets&quot;.

===Rugby union===
In rugby union, five players take kicks on goal from the centre of the 22-metre line. If the scores are level after five players from each team have kicked, the shootout goes to sudden death. This tie-breaking method was used for the first time at a professional level in Leicester Tigers&#x27; Heineken Cup semi-final victory over the Cardiff Blues on 3 May 2009; after a 26–26 draw after extra time, Leicester won the shootout 7–6. The second instance of this was in the 2022 Champion&#x27;s Cup quarterfinal between Toulouse and Munster, after a 24–24 draw, with Toulouse winning the shootout 4–2.

===Water polo===
Following a tie in regulation, 5 players and a goalkeeper are chosen by the coaches of each team. Players shoot from the 5 meter line alternately at either end of the pool in turn until all five have taken a shot. If the score is still tied, the same players shoot alternately until one team misses and the other scores. The scores from the penalty shootout are added to the score instead of being counted as a separate score as in other sports. Colleges have no such shootout procedure; teams play two straight 3-minute periods, and if still tied play multiple 3-minute golden goal periods.

=== American football ===
In the revived XFL, for games that end in a tie after regulation, each team gets up to five one-play possessions to score two-point conversions from the five-yard line, with each team taking alternating turns. Unlike other gridiron football leagues, a coin toss does not determine who has first possession in overtime; instead, the visiting team has first possession and the home team second for each round. The defensive team cannot score in overtime; if the offensive team commits a turnover, the play is ruled dead immediately. If the defensive team commits a penalty, the ball is placed on the one-yard line and the conversion attempt retried; any subsequent defensive penalty results in an automatic score for the offensive team. If the offensive team commits a pre-snap penalty, the ball is respotted pursuant to regular rules; however, a post-snap offensive penalty results in loss of down and no score. If the score remains tied after five rounds, subsequent rounds are played until the tie is broken.

Since the 2021 NCAA Division I FBS football season, if a game reaches triple overtime, teams alternate running two-point plays, instead of starting another drive at the opponent&#x27;s 25-yard line.

==Other uses==
Penalty shootouts are also used on a few game shows:
* The final round of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; involves the remaining two contestants having to answer a series of three to five questions each (depending on the version); the player who answered more questions correctly in the previous round has the option to choose who goes first. Whoever has more correct answers at the end of the round is declared the winner; in the event of tie, the round goes to sudden death, where questions continue to be asked to every player until one contestant answers correctly and his or her opponent answers incorrectly.
* &quot;The Rich List&quot; uses a penalty shootout tiebreaker where the two teams are asked questions about the same subject until one team answers correctly and the other team answers incorrectly. Whoever gives the last correct answer in the tiebreaker advances to the bonus round.

<text>Count Pál János Ede Teleki de Szék (1 November 1879 – 3 April 1941) was a Hungarian politician who served as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Hungary from 1920 to 1921 and from 1939 to 1941. He was also an expert in geography, a university professor, a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and chief scout of the Hungarian Scout Association. He descended from an aristocratic family from Transylvania.

Teleki tried to keep Hungary neutral during the early stages of the Second World War despite cooperating with Nazi Germany to regain Hungarian territory lost in the Treaty of Trianon. When Teleki learned that German troops had entered Hungary en route to invade Yugoslavia, effectively killing hopes of Hungarian neutrality, he committed suicide.

He is a controversial figure in Hungarian history because as prime minister he tried to preserve Hungarian autonomy under difficult political circumstances, but also proposed and enacted far-reaching anti-Jewish laws.

==Early life==
Teleki was born to Géza Teleki (1844–1913), a Hungarian politician and Interior Minister, and his wife Irén Muráty (Muratisz) (1852–1941), the only child of a very wealthy Greek merchant and banking family, in Budapest, Hungary. Irén Muráty was fluent in Greek. Her family, the Muráty (Greek: Μουράτη), originally came from Kozani, in northern Greece. Teleki attended Budapest Lutheran elementary school from 1885 to 1889, and Pest Calasanz High School (&quot;gymnazium&quot;) from 1889 to 1897. In 1897 he started upper-division work at Budapest University studying law and political science. Teleki then studied at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Economy in Magyaróvár (&quot;Magyaróvári Magyar Királyi Gazdasági Akadémia&quot;), and after struggling to complete his studies, graduated with a PhD in 1903. He went on to become a university professor and expert on geography and socio-economic affairs in pre-World War I Hungary and a well-respected educator. For instance, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn was one of his students. He fought in the First World War as a volunteer.

In 1918–19, he compiled and published a map depicting the ethnographic make up of the Hungarian nation. Based on the density of population according to the 1910 census, the so-called &quot;Red map&quot; was created for the peace talk in Treaty of Trianon. His maps were an excellent composition of social and geographic data, even by today&#x27;s well-developed Geographic Information System&#x27;s point of view. From 1911 to 1913 he was Director of Scientific Publishing for the Institute of Geography, and from 1910 to 1923 he was Secretary General of the Geographical Society. He was a delegate to the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919. Between 1937 and 1939, he was the Hungarian representative in the International committee on intellectual cooperation of the League of Nations.

==Scouting==
In the summer of 1927, Teleki&#x27;s son Géza, a member of the Hungarian Sea Scouts, was attending a Sea Scout rally held at Helsingør, Denmark. On a sailing cruise, he ignored a reprimand from his Scoutmaster, Fritz M. de Molnár, for failure to carry out a small but necessary exercise of seamanship. Molnár tried to drive home his point by threatening to tell the boy&#x27;s father on their return to Budapest. Géza replied &quot;Oh, Dad&#x27;s not interested in Scouting.&quot; This roused Molnár&#x27;s mettle, and he determined to take up the subject of Scouting with Count Teleki.

Molnár&#x27;s talk about Scouting intrigued Teleki, and he was instrumental in supporting Scouting within Hungary. He became Hungary&#x27;s Chief Scout, a member of the International Scout Committee from 1929 until 1939, Camp Chief of the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at The Royal Forest at Gödöllő, Hungary, Chief Scout of the Hungarian Scout Association, and a close friend and contemporary of Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell. His influence and inspiration were a major factor in the success of Scouting in Hungary, and contributed to its success in other countries as well.

==Political life==

===1905-1920===

He first ran in the 1905 elections under the banner of the National Constitutional Party, formed from the &quot;dissidents&quot; of the Liberal Party led by junior Gyula Andrássy, in the electoral district of Nagysomkút in Szatmár County. He was elected as a member of parliament. He secured his mandate again in the 1906 elections. However, by the 1910 elections, when the collapse of the coalition government became evident, he chose not to pursue another mandate and temporarily withdrew from politics. At that time, he was not yet a significant political figure. He served as a volunteer in World War I, fighting first on the Serbian front and then on the Italian front, where he held the rank of captain until 1917. He was subsequently appointed head of the National War Relief Office.

After the victory of the Aster Revolution, he retreated from public life and stayed in Switzerland during the period of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Meanwhile, at the request of the Anti-Bolshevik Committee, he served as foreign minister in the counter-revolutionary governments in Szeged (all three of them).

In the first elections following the victory of the counter-revolution in 1920, he won a parliamentary mandate in the city center district of Szeged representing the Christian National Union Party. In the government formed on March 15 by Simonyi-Semadam, he was appointed foreign minister, a position he accepted on April 19. He attended the signing of the Treaty of Trianon in this capacity, although the actual signing was carried out by two other politically insignificant members of the Hungarian delegation. The government resigned a month later, and Horthy requested Teleki to form a new cabinet, which he accepted.

===First premiership===
On July 25, 1920, Miklós Horthy was appointed Teleki as Prime Minister. Additionally, he served as the minister without portfolio for national minorities and led the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Following King Charles IV&#x27;s attempt to return, he resigned from the premiership on April 14, 1921.

One of the most controversial issues during Teleki&#x27;s first administration was the numerus clausus law, specifically the 1920 Act XXV (&#x27;regulating enrollment in universities, the technical university, the Budapest University of Economics, and law academies&#x27;), which means &#x27;closed number&#x27; (i.e., a defined, fixed number). It was introduced to Parliament by the Minister of Religion and Public Education and was adopted in September 1920. The law aimed primarily to adjust the number of students in Hungarian higher education to the perceived or actual needs of the country, intending to limit the number of those entering higher education. The proportion of students was meant to reflect the ratio of the &#x27;ethnic groups&#x27; living in Hungary. The main objective of the law was to ensure that &#x27;Hungarians&#x27; (excluding Jewish Hungarians) participated in universities in proportion to their numbers within the population. The law provoked deep outrage among Jewish communities in Hungary as it questioned their Hungarian identity. Many regarded the law as the first anti-Jewish law, as it primarily restricted the Jewish community, treating them as a separate nationality rather than by their religious denomination, which deviated from previous legal practices, effectively categorizing them as non-Hungarians.

===Party Leader===

In 1938, Teleki regained a parliamentary mandate in a by-election in the Tokaj district, resigning from his membership in the upper house to rejoin the House of Representatives. On May 14, 1938, he became the Minister of Religion and Public Education in the newly formed Imrédy government, a position he held until Imrédy&#x27;s downfall. He was one of the leading members of the Hungarian delegation during the negotiations of the First Vienna Award. In contrast to the Imrédy government, which turned toward Germany and Italy, the Axis Powers, he was a staunch Anglophile.

On February 2, 1939, as a solution to the parliamentary conflict (after 62 government party representatives had previously split and turned against Imrédy), under Teleki&#x27;s leadership, the government party and the former &#x27;dissident&#x27; representatives reunited, and the government party adopted the name Hungarian Life Party (previously known as the National Unity Party).

===Preserved Hungarian autonomy===

Some view Teleki as a moral hero who tried to avoid Hungary&#x27;s involvement in World War II. He sent Tibor Eckhardt, a high ranking Smallholders Party politician, to the United States with $5 million for the Hungarian Minister in the United States, János Pelényi, to prepare the Hungarian government in exile, for when he and Regent Horthy would have to leave the country. According to supporters of this view, his object was to save what could be saved, under political and military pressure from Nazi Germany, and like the Polish government in exile, to try to survive in some fashion during the war years to come.

===Teleki holds Hungary to &quot;Non-belligerent&quot; status===

Rejoining the government in 1938 as Minister of Education, Teleki supported Germany&#x27;s take over of Czechoslovakia with the hopes that the dismemberment of Hungary completed in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon would be undone. On 16 February 1939, Hungarian Prime Minister Béla Imrédy, who had been known as a pro-fascist, anti-Semitic leader, was forced from office after it was revealed that he was of Jewish descent. Teleki became Prime minister for the second time on 15 February 1939. While he strove to close down several fascist political parties, he did nothing to end the existing anti-Semitic laws.

On 24 August 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which stipulated the Soviet Union&#x27;s long-standing &quot;interest&quot; in Bessarabia, Romania. One week later, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and demanded the use of the Hungarian railway system through Kassa (then in Hungary) so that German troops could attack Poland from the south. Hungary traditionally had strong ties with Poland, and Teleki refused Germany&#x27;s demand. Horthy told the German ambassador that &quot;he would sooner blow up the rail lines than to participate in an attack on Poland&quot; (which would completely paralyse the only railway connection from Hungary to Poland, if the Germans decided to march through Hungary without permission). Hungary declared that it was a &quot;non-belligerent&quot; nation and refused to allow German forces to travel through or over Hungary to attack Poland. As a result of Teleki&#x27;s refusal to co-operate with Germany, during the autumn of 1939 and the summer of 1940 more than 100,000 Polish soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of civilians, many of them Jewish, escaped from Poland and crossed the border into Hungary. The Hungarian government then permitted the Polish Red Cross and the Polish Catholic Church to operate in the open. The Polish soldiers were formally interned, but most of them managed to flee to France by spring of 1940, thanks to the indulgent or friendly attitude of officials.

However, with Germany&#x27;s seizure of Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland, the buffer nations between Hungary and the belligerent nations of Germany and Soviet Union had evaporated. Germany made economic demands on Hungary to support the war, and offered to repay with arms deliveries, but because of developments in the Balkans, they were routed to the Romanian Army instead.

In his diaries, Italian Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini&#x27;s son-in-law, wrote that during a visit to Rome by Teleki in March 1940, Teleki &quot;has avoided taking any open position one way or the other but has not hidden his sympathy for the Western Powers and fears an integral German victory like the plague&quot;. Ciano reported that Teleki later said that he hoped &quot;for the defeat of Germany, not a complete defeat—that might provoke violent shocks—but a kind of defeat that would blunt her teeth and claws for a long time&quot;.

===Germany demands Hungary&#x27;s assistance===

In 1940, Germany used the Soviet Union&#x27;s imminent movement to take over Bessarabia as an excuse to prepare to occupy the vital Romanian oil fields. Germany&#x27;s General Staff approached Hungary&#x27;s General Staff and sought passage of its troops through Hungary and for Hungary&#x27;s participation in the takeover. Germany held out Transylvania as Hungary&#x27;s reward. The Hungarian government resisted, desired to remain neutral and held out some hope for assistance from the Italians. Hungary sent a special envoy to Rome: &quot;For the Hungarians there arises the problem either of letting the Germans pass, or opposing them with force. In either case the Hungarian liberty would come to an end&quot;. Mussolini replied, &quot;How could this ever be since I am Hitler&#x27;s ally and intend to remain so?&quot; However, Teleki allowed German troops to cross Hungarian territory into southern Romania, with the reward in August 1940 of the return to Hungary of a large part of Teleki&#x27;s ancestral Transylvanian homeland in the Second Vienna Award. In November, Teleki&#x27;s government signed the Tripartite Pact, a move that would come back to haunt him only a few months later.

In March 1941, Teleki strongly objected to Hungarian participation in the invasion of Yugoslavia. Hungary&#x27;s resistance to aiding Germany caused German mistrust. Hungary was not informed of Hitler&#x27;s top-secret preparations for invading the Soviet Union and was not initially part of the invasion. &quot;Hungary, in the period of preparation for Barbarossa, is not to be counted as an ally beyond the present status...&quot;

Furthermore, German troops were not to cross Hungarian territories, and Hungarian airfields were not to be used by the Luftwaffe, according to the new directives of the High Command on 22 March 1941. Teleki believed that only a Danubian Federation could help the Central and Eastern European states (Austria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria) escape Germany&#x27;s domination.

In the book, &quot;Transylvania The Land Beyond the Forest&quot; Louis C. Cornish described how Teleki, under constant surveillance by the German Gestapo during 1941, sent a secret communication to contacts in America.

In 1941, the American journalist Dorothy Thompson supported the statement of others: &quot;I took from Count Teleki&#x27;s office a monograph which he had written upon the structure of European nations. A distinguished geographer, he was developing a plan for regional federation, based upon geographical and economic realities&quot;. Teleki received no response to his ideas and was left to resolve the situation on his own.

===Teleki must choose between Axis and Allies===

The event that eventually led to Teleki&#x27;s suicide began on 25 March 1941 when Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragisa Cvetkovic and Yugoslav Minister for Foreign Affairs Aleksandar Cincar Marković travelled to Vienna and signed the Tripartite Pact. In the late evening on 26/27 March 1941, Air Force Generals Dušan Simović and Borivoje Mirković had executed a bloodless &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, refuted signatures on the alliance and accepted a British guarantee of security instead. Germany saw its southern flank potentially exposed just as it was preparing Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. Germany planned the invasion of Yugoslavia (Directive No. 25) to compel it to remain part of the Axis. Hitler used Hungary&#x27;s membership in the Tripartite Pact to demand that Hungary join in. Döme Sztójay, the Hungarian ambassador to Germany, was sent home by air with a message for Horthy:

Teleki had signed a non-aggression pact, the Treaty of Eternal Friendship, with Yugoslavia on 12 December 1940, only five months earlier, and would not assent to assisting with the invasion. Teleki&#x27;s government chose a middle ground, opting to remain out of the German-Yugoslav conflict unless either Hungarian minorities were in danger or Yugoslavia collapsed. Teleki relayed his government&#x27;s position to London and sought allowance for Hungary&#x27;s difficult position.

On 3 April 1941, Teleki received a telegram from the Hungarian minister in London that British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden had threatened to break diplomatic relations with Hungary if it did not actively resist the passage of German troops across its territory and to declare war if it attacked Yugoslavia.

Teleki&#x27;s enduring desire was to keep Hungary non-aligned but he could not ignore Nazi Germany&#x27;s dominant influence. Teleki was now faced with two bad choices. He could continue to resist Germany&#x27;s demands for its help in the invasion of Yugoslavia although he knew that would likely mean that after Germany conquered Yugoslavia, it would next turn its attention to Hungary, as had happened to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Poland. He could allow German troops to cross Hungarian territory even though it would betray Yugoslavia and lead the Allies to declare war on Hungary.

Horthy, who had resisted Germany&#x27;s pressure, agreed to Germany&#x27;s demands. Teleki met with the cabinet council that evening. He complained that Horthy had &quot;told me thirty-four times that he would never make war for foreign interests, and now he has changed his mind&quot;.

Before Teleki could chart a course through the political thicket, the decision was torn from him by General Henrik Werth, the chief of the Hungarian General Staff. Without the sanction of the Hungarian government, Werth, of German origin, made private arrangements with the German High Command for the transport of the German troops across Hungary. Teleki denounced Werth&#x27;s action as treason.

===Germany enters Hungary, Teleki commits suicide===

Shortly after 9:00 p.m., he left the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs for his apartment in the Sándor Palace. At around midnight, he received a call that is thought to have informed him that the German army had just started its march into Hungary. Teleki committed suicide with a pistol during the night of 3 April 1941 and was found the next morning. His suicide note said in part:

Winston Churchill later wrote, &quot;His suicide was a sacrifice to absolve himself and his people from guilt in the German attack on Yugoslavia.&quot; On 6 April 1941, Germany launched Operation Punishment (&quot;Unternehmen Strafgericht&quot;), the bombing of Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Some historians consider Teleki&#x27;s suicide an act of patriotism. Britain shortly afterward broke diplomatic relations but did not declare war until December.

Befitting his commitment to Scouting and to Hungary, Teleki was buried at Gödöllő, the location of the Royal Palace.

==Legacy==
===From Philo-Semitism to anti-Semitism===

Teleki is considered &quot;one of the most consistently unaccommodating anti-Semitic politicians of the post-Trianon period&quot;. His attitude towards Jews parallels the changing demographic and social situation in Hungary before and after World War I. In the Austro-Hungarian empire the generally fiercely patriotic Hungarian Jews were securing the tenuous Hungarian majority in the Hungarian kingdom. Consequently, Teleki stated at the peace conference of 1919 that &quot;the majority of the Hungarian Jews have completely assimilated to the Hungarians [...] from a social point of view, the Hungarian Jews are not Jews any more but Hungarians.&quot; After 1920, with a greatly reduced Hungarian territory, Teleki changed his mind about the Hungarian Jews: he regarded the Jews as a &quot;problem of life and death for the Hungarian people&quot;.
After Regent Horthy appointed Teleki Prime Minister on 19 July 1920 he introduced the first anti-Semitic laws introduced in Europe after the First World War, the so-called &quot;Numerus clausus Act&quot; of 22 September 1920 which allowed Jews to attend universities only in a direct relation to their proportion of the Hungarian population. He and his government resigned less than a year later on 14 April 1921 when the former king, Karl IV, attempted to retake Hungary&#x27;s throne.

From 1921 until 1938, Teleki was a professor at Budapest University. While there, journalists asked him what he thought about the anti-Jewish violence that had occurred on the university campus. He replied: &quot;This din does not bother me. In any case, the students take examinations that test their knowledge of the sea and this din is aptly suited to that of the sea.&quot;

Due to the feudal nature of pre-War Hungarian society, where both rich and impoverished aristocrats tried to maintain an &quot;aristocratic&quot; life style and a disadvantaged peasant class had no means of learning and social mobility, the Hungarian Jews constituted a disproportionally large part of the Hungarian middle class. In the 1930 census, Jews comprised 5.1% of the population, but among physicians 54.5 percent were Jewish, journalists 31.7%, and lawyers 49.2%. Persons of Jewish faith controlled four of the five major banks, from 19.5 to 33% of the national income, and around 80 percent of the country&#x27;s industry. Already after the short lived Hungarian Soviet Republic (21 March – 1 August 1919), whose leaders, concomitantly with their middle class origins, were often of Jewish parentage, and even more after the worldwide depression struck in the late 1920s and early 1930s, which conversely was associated with Jewish wealth and financial power, the country&#x27;s Jews were made scapegoats for all of Hungary&#x27;s economic, political and social plights.

After a period of considerable economic turbulence and a general political turn to the far right, Teleki became Prime Minister once again on 16 February 1939. Although considered an Anglophile, one of the first things he did in Parliament was to push the Second Anti-Jewish act initiated by his predecessor Béla Imrédy. This was the first law which defined the term &quot;Jew&quot; in explicitly racial terms: &quot;A person belonging to the Jewish denomination is at the same time a member of the Jewish racial community and it is natural that the cessation of membership in the Jewish denomination does not result in any change in that person’s association with the racial community.&quot; It forbade Jews to hold any government position, to be editors, publishers, producers or directors. It restated and reinforced the Numerus Clausus act of 1920 and extended its provisions (representation according to proportion of population) to the business world, regulating even the number of Jewish employees (one in five or two in nine maximum, depending on the size). These laws would affect up to 825,000 Jews, who lived in territory reacquired by Hungary in 1941.

Teleki promulgated Law No. II relating to national defense, on 11 March 1939, and signed it into law on 12 May of the same year. The text of the bill stipulated that all young Jewish men of arms-bearing age join forced-labor service. In 1940, this compulsory service was extended to all able-bodied male Jews. As a result of the laws established during Teleki&#x27;s tenure, 15,000–35,000 Jews in the re-acquired part of Czechoslovakia, who had difficulty in proving their former Hungarian citizenship, were deported.

These Jews, without Hungarian citizenship, were sent to a location near Kamenets-Podolski, where in one of the first acts of mass killing during World War II, all but two thousand of these individuals were executed by the Nazi Einsatzgruppe (mobile killing unit).

Teleki wrote the preamble to the Second Anti-Jewish Law (1939) and prepared the Third Anti-Jewish Law in 1940. He also signed 52 anti-Jewish decrees during his rule, and members of his government issued 56 further decrees against Jews.

Teleki devoted a great deal of energy and political savvy to the passage of the second anti-Jewish bill, stating that he pushed it not for tactical reasons but because of his deep personal convictions. During Teleki&#x27;s second term in 1940, Hungarian Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Szálasi was given amnesty, and the Nazi movement became stronger.
Although the laws of the Labor Service System were put in effect during Teleki&#x27;s lifetime, they were radically enforced only after Hungary had entered the war. Then the situation of the Jewish forced laborers, which were organized in labor battalions, commanded by Hungarian military officers, became dire. They were engaged in war-related construction, often subject to extreme cold, and given inadequate shelter, food, and medical care. At least 27,000 Jewish forced laborers died before Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944, after which the Hungarian state authorities in close cooperation with the German &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; of Adolf Eichmann rapidly organized and implemented the mass deportation of Jews to the death camps.

While it is true that tens of thousands of young Hungarians were conscripted into military service at the same time and sent to fight on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union, often ill-equipped and badly trained, and bore the brunt of the miseries of the German defeat, the Hungarian participation in the Eastern campaign was voluntary, and the suffering of its soldiers was war induced and not deliberately inflicted as with the Jewish labor battalions.

===Statue controversy===

In 2004, the Teleki Pál Memorial Committee, initially supported by Budapest mayor Gábor Demszky, proposed erecting a statue by in his honor on the 63rd anniversary of his death in front of the palace on Castle Hill where he governed and, finally, committed suicide. Because of his close connection with Hungarian anti-Semitism there was a strong opposition both by Hungarian liberals and Hungarian and international Jewish organizations, especially the Simon Wiesenthal Center and its leader Efraim Zuroff. Consequently, the mayor withdrew his support and the Minister of Culture István Hiller canceled the plans. On 5 April 2004, the statue was finally placed in the courtyard of the Catholic Church in the town of Balatonboglár on the shore of Lake Balaton. Balatonboglár had during World War II been host to thousands of Polish refugees who opened in that town one of only two secondary schools for Poles in Europe during 1939–1944. They credited Teleki with opening Hungary&#x27;s borders to them and named a street in Warsaw for him after the war ended. In 2001 he was posthumously awarded Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland. In 2020 Teleki earned two monuments in Poland, one in Skierniewice and one in Kraków, both related to his pro-Polish stand during the Polish-Soviet war of 1920.

A street in Borča, a suburb of the Serbian capital Belgrade, was named &quot;Ulica Pala Telekija&quot; (&quot;Pal Teleki Street&quot;) in 2011.

<doc id="674375" wikidata="Q1452502" url="?curid=674375" title="Christianisation of the Germanic peoples">
<text>The Germanic peoples underwent gradual Christianization in the course of late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. By CE 700, England and Francia were officially Christian, and by 1100 Germanic paganism had also ceased to have political influence in Scandinavia.

==History==
Germanic peoples began entering the Roman Empire in large numbers at the same time that Christianity was spreading there. The connection of Christianity to the Roman Empire was both a factor in encouraging conversion as well as, at times, a motive for persecuting Christians. Until the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes who had migrated there (with the exceptions of the Saxons, Franks, and Lombards, see below) had converted to Christianity. Many of them, notably the Goths and Vandals, adopted Arianism instead of the Trinitarian (a.k.a. Nicene or &quot;orthodox&quot;) beliefs that were dogmatically defined by the church in the Nicene Creed. The gradual rise of Germanic Christianity was, at times, voluntary, particularly among groups associated with the Roman Empire. From the 6th century, Germanic tribes were converted (or re-converted from Arianism) by missionaries of the Catholic Church.

Many Goths converted to Christianity as individuals outside the Roman Empire. Most members of other tribes converted to Christianity when their respective tribes settled within the Empire, and most Franks and Anglo-Saxons converted a few generations later. During the centuries following the fall of Rome, as the East–West Schism between the dioceses loyal to the Pope of Rome in the West and those loyal to the other Patriarchs in the East grew, most of the Germanic peoples (excepting the Crimean Goths and a few other eastern groups) would gradually become strongly allied with the Catholic Church in the West, particularly as a result of the reign of Charlemagne.

Most of the East Germanic peoples, such as the Goths, Gepids, and Vandals, along with the Langobards and the Suevi in Spain converted to Arian Christianity, a form of Christianity that rejected the divinity of Christ. The first Germanic people to convert to Arianism were the Visigoths, at the latest in 376 when they entered the Roman Empire. This followed a longer period of missionary work by both Orthodox Christians and Arians, such as the Arian Wulfila, who was made missionary bishop of the Goths in 341 and translated the Bible into Gothic. Initially, Gothic Christians had also faced some persecution under the Gothic King Athanaric, from 363 to 372. The Vandals appear to have converted following their entry into the Empire in 405; for other east Germanic peoples it is possible that Visigothic missionaries played a role in their conversion, although this is unclear. Each Germanic people in the Arian faith had their own ecclesiastical organization that was controlled by the king, while the liturgy was performed in the Germanic vernacular and a vernacular bible (probably Wulfila&#x27;s) was used. The Arian Germanic peoples all eventually converted to Nicene Christianity, which had become the dominant form of Christianity within the Roman Empire; the last to convert were the Visigoths in Spain under their king Reccared in 587.

===Franks and Alamanni===

There is little evidence for any Roman missionary activity in &quot;Germania&quot; prior to the conversion of the Franks. The areas of the Roman Empire conquered by the Franks, Alemanni, and Baiuvarii were mostly Christian already, and while some bishoprics continued to operate, others were abandoned, showing a reduction in the influence of Christianity in these areas. In 496, the Frankish king Clovis I converted to Nicene Christianity. This began a period of missionizing within Frankish territory and the reestablishment of church provinces that had been abandoned within former Roman territory. The Anglo-Saxons gradually converted following a mission sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 595. In the 7th century, the Hiberno-Scottish mission resulted in the establishment of many monasteries in Frankish territory. At the same time, Frankish-supported missionary activity spread across the Rhine, led by figures of the Anglo-Saxon mission such as Saint Boniface. This affected peoples such as the Thuringians, Alemanni, Bavarians, Frisians, and Saxons.

===Continental Saxons===
The Saxons rejected Christianization, likely in part because doing so would have involved giving up their independence and becoming part of the Frankish realm. They were eventually forcibly converted by Charlemagne as a result of their conquest in the Saxon Wars in 776/777: Charlemagne thereby combined religious conversion with political loyalty to his empire. Continued resistance to conversion seems to have played a role in Saxon rebellions between 782 and 785, then again from 792 to 804, and during the Stellinga rebellion in (844).

===England===

The Anglo-Saxons gradually converted following the Gregorian mission sent by Pope Gregory the Great in 595, as well as the Hiberno-Scottish mission from the north-west. Pope Gregory I sent the first Archbishop of Canterbury, Augustine, to southern England in 597. The process of conversion usually proceeded from the top of the social hierarchy downwards, generally peacefully, with a local ruler choosing to convert, whereupon his subjects then also nominally became Christian. This process was often only partial, perhaps due to confusion as to the nature of the new religion, or for a desire to take the best of both traditions. A famous case of this was king Rædwald of East Anglia, who had a Christian altar erected within his pagan temple. His suspected burial place at Sutton Hoo shows definite influences of both Christian and pagan burial rites.

The last pagan Anglo-Saxon king, the Jutish king Arwald of the Isle of Wight, was killed in battle in 686 fighting against the imposition of Christianity in his kingdom.

During the prolonged period of Viking incursions and settlement of Anglo-Saxon England pagan ideas and religious rites made something of a comeback, mainly in the Danelaw during the 9th century and particularly in the Kingdom of Northumbria, whose last king to rule it as an independent state was Eric Bloodaxe, a Viking, probably pagan and ruler until 954 AD.

===Scandinavia===
Attempts to Christianize Scandinavia were first systematically undertaken by Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious. In 831, he made the missionary Ansgar archbishop of the newly created Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen to undertake a mission to Scandinavia, which, however, mostly failed. Missionary activity resumed under the Ottonian dynasty. The Danish king Harald Bluetooth was baptized in the late 900s, but most Danes appear to have remained pagan and converted later under English influence during the reign of Canute the Great. Norway was converted mostly by the activity of its kings. Despite resistance such as the rule of the pagan Haakon Sigurdsson, Christianization was largely achieved by Olaf II (died 1030), who had converted in England. The settlement of Iceland included some Christians, but full conversion there did not occur until a decision of the Allthing in 1000. The last Germanic people to convert were the Swedes, although the Geats had converted earlier. The pagan Temple at Uppsala seems to have continued to exist into the early 1100s.

==Characteristics==
The baptism of Clovis highlights two important characteristics of the Christianization of Europe. Clovis I&#x27;s wife Clotilde was a Chalcedonian Christian and had an important role in the conversion of her husband. Long before his own baptism, Clovis had allowed his sons to be baptised. However, the decisive reason for Clovis to adopt the Christian faith was the belief that he received spiritual battle aid from Christ. In the Battle of Tolbiac he prayed to Christ for victory. Clovis was victorious, and afterward he had himself instructed in the Christian faith by Saint Remigius.

That a pagan like Clovis could ask Christ for help shows the adaptability of Germanic polytheism. In the polytheistic Germanic tradition, &quot;if Odin failed, one absolutely could try it with Christ for once.&quot; The Christian sense of religious exclusivism was unknown to the pagans. As a result, pagans could be pragmatic and almost utilitarian in their religious decisions. A good example for this are several Thor&#x27;s Hammers with engraved crosses, worn as amulets, that archaeologists have found in Scandinavia. Another exemplary event happened during Ansgar&#x27;s second stay in Birka, when a pagan priest demanded from the locals that they not participate in the cult of the foreign Christian God. If they did not have enough gods yet, they should elevate one of their deceased kings, Erik, to be a god.

The baptism of Clovis I also highlights the sacral role of the Germanic king. A Germanic king was not only a political ruler, but also held the highest religious office for his people. He was seen as of divine descent, was the leader of the religious cult and was responsible for the fertility of the land and military victory. Accordingly, the conversion of their leader had a strong impact on his people. If he considered it appropriate to adopt the Christian belief, this also was a good idea for them.

Conversion of the Germanic tribes in general took place &quot;top to bottom&quot; (Fletcher 1999:236), in the sense that missionaries aimed at converting the Germanic nobility first, who would then impose their new faith on the general population. This is attributable to the sacral position of the king in Germanic paganism: The king is charged with interacting with the divine on behalf of his people, so that the general population saw nothing wrong with their kings choosing alternate modes of worship (Padberg 1998:29; though Fletcher 1999:238 would rather attribute the motivation for conversion to the workings of loyalty-for-reward ethics that underpinned the relationship between a king and his retinue). Consequently, Christianity had to be made palatable to these Migration Age warlords as a heroic religion of conquerors, a rather straightforward task, considering the military splendour of the Roman Empire.

Thus early Germanic Christianity was presented as an alternative to native Germanic paganism and elements were syncretized, for examples parallels between Woden and Christ. A fine illustration of these tendencies is the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Dream of the Rood&quot;, where Jesus is cast in the heroic model of a Germanic warrior, who faces his death unflinchingly and even eagerly. The Cross, speaking as if it were a member of Christ&#x27;s band of retainers, accepts its fate as it watches its Creator die, and then explains that Christ&#x27;s death was not a defeat but a victory. This is in direct correspondence to the Germanic pagan ideals of fealty to one&#x27;s lord.

<doc id="674386" wikidata="Q313505" url="?curid=674386" title="Paul Di'Anno">
<text>Paul Andrews (17 May 1958 – 21 October 2024), better known by his stage name Paul Di&#x27;Anno, was an English heavy metal singer who was the lead vocalist for Iron Maiden from 1978 to 1981. In his post-Maiden career, Di&#x27;Anno issued numerous albums over the years, as both a solo artist and as a member of bands such as Gogmagog, Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s Battlezone, Killers, Rockfellas, and Warhorse. Together with fellow Iron Maiden member Dennis Stratton, he joined Praying Mantis for the recording of their 1990 live album &quot;Live at Last&quot;.

== Career ==
=== Early years ===
Di&#x27;Anno was born on 17 May 1958 in Chingford, Essex, where he also grew up. Because of his Brazilian father, Di&#x27;Anno held dual British and Brazilian citizenship. He spent his teenage years singing in various rock bands and working as a butcher in Station Road and as a chef in hotels and restaurants.

=== Iron Maiden (1978–1981) ===
According to Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days&quot; DVD, he was introduced to the band by drummer Doug Sampson, an old friend of Steve Harris (Iron Maiden&#x27;s founder and bass player) from his days in the band Smiler. It was around this time that he first adopted the stage name Di&#x27;Anno, which he would later use to claim Italian descent. Their first audition with Rod Smallwood reputedly failed when Di&#x27;Anno was arrested for showing off his pocket-knife in public.

The band&#x27;s 1980 self-titled release quickly became acknowledged as a classic of its genre, as the band merged punk&#x27;s energy with metal&#x27;s riffs and progressive rock complexity, serving as the blueprint for such future genres as thrash metal and speed metal and influencing later progressive metal bands. 1981 saw the release of their second album, &quot;Killers&quot;, as well as a stopgap live EP, &quot;Maiden Japan&quot;.

Iron Maiden decided that to progress they would have to find a singer capable of being on tour. They found a replacement in former Samson frontman Bruce Dickinson. Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s last show with the band was on 10 September 1981 at the Odd Fellow&#x27;s Mansion in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1981, he left Iron Maiden after a meeting with the band and their manager Rod Smallwood. Di&#x27;Anno jokingly stated: &quot;It&#x27;s like having Mussolini and Adolf Hitler run your band. Because it is Rod Smallwood and Steve Harris and that&#x27;s it. There can&#x27;t be anyone else and my character is too strong for that so me an&#x27; Steve was always fighting&quot;. Di&#x27;Anno was paid out by Smallwood at the time of his departure and did receive royalties for songwriting credits.

=== Di&#x27;Anno (1983–1985) ===
Di&#x27;Anno was the first project by Paul Di&#x27;Anno after he was fired from Iron Maiden. This group was originally called Lonewolf but after disagreement with a group already called Lone Wolf, they changed their name and ended up recording only one album under the simple moniker of Di&#x27;Anno. Musically the band shifted away from the NWOBHM sound of Iron Maiden to a more Americanized sound similar to bands like Journey and Foreigner. On the tour, Di&#x27;Anno played &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot; from his catalogue of Iron Maiden songs, along with their own songs and a few other covers (most notably The Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be Misunderstood&quot;). Having limited success, the six-piece band disbanded shortly after they were done touring. The only other recordings available from this band are a single of &quot;Heartuser&quot;, a Japanese single of &quot;Flaming Heart&quot; and a Sweden-only VHS release called &quot;Live at the Palace&quot; (also available on DVD as &quot;Di&#x27;Anno Live from London&quot;). During the latter performance, the band played an unreleased song entitled &quot;Spiritual Guidance&quot;, which Paul told the audience would be on the band&#x27;s forthcoming album. This album was never recorded.

Last known line-up:

* Paul Di&#x27;Anno – lead vocals
* Lee Slater – guitars, vocals
* P. J. Ward – guitars, vocals
* Kevin Browne – bass, vocals
* Mark Venables – keyboards, vocals
* Frank Noon – drums (replacing Dave Irving from the album line-up who in turn replaced Mark Stewart)

=== Gogmagog (1985) ===
In 1985, Di&#x27;Anno joined a project that was intended to be a supergroup. The group, called &quot;Gogmagog&quot; (see the Biblical book Ezekiel 38:1–2), was put together by DJ and record producer Jonathan King, best known for discovering the group Genesis in the late 1960s. King assembled a star-studded line-up featuring Di&#x27;Anno, drummer Clive Burr, guitarists Janick Gers and Pete Willis and bassist Neil Murray, but the members became increasingly frustrated by a policy that forbade them from writing any original material. Gogmagog released a three-song E.P. on the independent Food For Thought label in 1985 entitled &quot;I Will Be There&quot;, with Russ Ballard writing the title song and producer King writing the other two songs. Although reviews were generally positive, the EP did not chart and the group disbanded after King began to lose interest in the project. Di&#x27;Anno has been completely dismissive of the short-lived project, referring to it as &quot;nothing&quot; and claiming he only got involved for the money.

=== Battlezone (1985–1989, 1998) ===
After the break-up of his self-titled band, Di&#x27;Anno formed Strike with DeeRal (guitar) who recruited drummer Bob Falck (who had used the name Sid Falck while playing drums in Overkill) and the Hurley brothers John (second guitar) and Chaz (bass). The project was eventually named Battlezone, after a name straight from a comic book, upon the vocalist&#x27;s return to Britain in 1985. 1986 saw the enrolment of former Lonewolf and Tokyo Blade guitarist John Wiggins.

The band&#x27;s initial line-up comprised Di&#x27;Anno, guitarists John Wiggins and John Hurley, bassist Laurence Kessler and Adam Parsons on drums. Di&#x27;Anno had previously known guitarists John Wiggins and John Hurley from bands such as Deep Machine and Iron Cross. Parsons had gone under the stage name A.D. Dynamite while in Aunt May. However, Parsons left shortly after to replace Vince Hoare in the London-based glam band Belladonna (formed by former Hell&#x27;s Belles vocalist Paul Quigley, with Paul Lewis, Jeff Fox and Neil Criss) and Falck reappeared on the scene in time together with Danish bassist Pete West (Peter Vester) to record the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Fighting Back&quot;, written entirely by John Hurley, except the title track which was credited to Bob Falck.

Battlezone performed a club tour of America in 1987 to promote the début &quot;Fighting Back&quot;, but musical differences, arguments and physical fights within the band led to the departure of John Hurley and Bob Falck after the first tour. According to Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s book &quot;The Beast&quot;, Hurley had become an &quot;egomaniac&quot; and the drummer Falck a &quot;liability&quot;, so they were thrown out the band. Their places were taken by ex-Persian Risk members Graham Bath and Steve Hopgood respectively, following the tour&#x27;s completion.

The second album to be released was entitled &quot;Children of Madness&quot;, and it featured a track entitled &quot;Metal Tears&quot;, which is about a man who was unable to have a steady relationship and built a female robot, who he subsequently fell in love with. The original idea came from a book titled &quot;Clone&quot;. However, the track received criticism from the media for being very similar to a track (entitled &quot;London&quot;) on Queensrÿche&#x27;s &quot;Rage for Order&quot; album.

&quot;Guitarist Graham Bath, who had been recruited to play second guitar, wasn&#x27;t enthusiastic about touring, so he was fired from the band. Pete West, recommended a replacement Alf Batz, who joined just in time to go to New York for the video shoot.&quot; The video for &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; was played in rotation on MTV in the US.

Drugs and infighting again put a strain on the band. Towards the end of the final tour, most members had quit leaving Di&#x27;Anno to complete the tour with a backing band in order to fulfil his contract.

Subsequently, American guitarist Randy Scott, along with Dave Harman on guitar and Eddie Davidson on bass, signed up with Battlezone. However, the band were without proper management and disbanded shortly after. Battlezone played their last concert on 10 December 1989, at Dynamo Open Air in Eindhoven, Netherlands .

Following the break-up of Battlezone, Di&#x27;Anno and Hopgood formed the power metal band Killers, releasing four albums. Hurley would later form glam rock band L.O. Girls and release the &quot;Twelve Bore Honeymoon&quot; single in 1990 and &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Say I Love You&quot; in 1993. During 1990, Di&#x27;Anno fronted Praying Mantis for a tour of Japan, which was recorded for the subsequent &quot;Live at Last&quot; album release with ex-Iron Maiden guitarist Dennis Stratton. Wiggins joined a reformed Tokyo Blade in 1995.

By 1998, Di&#x27;Anno had resurrected the name Battlezone. Joining him were Wiggins and fellow ex-Tokyo Blade members bassist Colin Riggs and drummer Marc Angel. Second guitars were supplied by the Brazilian Paulo Turin. This line-up cut the album &quot;Feel My Pain&quot;, released by the fledgling &quot;Zoom Club&quot; label. Working titles for the album included &quot;Spoon Face&quot; and &quot;Smack&quot;, both containing references to heroin use. The album had a heavier edge compared to the first two Battlezone albums. The band undertook a sold-out Brazilian tour in January 1998, with erstwhile Killers colleagues bassist Gavin Cooper and guitarist Nick Burr joining on this South American tour.

The band toured Brazil in the same year playing a three-week tour to sold-out audiences up to 6000 fans a night. Being brought back down to earth, Battlezone upon their return home put on a gig at the Walthamstow Royal Standard with an audience of only a hundred or so and a gig at JB&#x27;s Dudley in the West Midlands attracting fewer than a dozen fans. A live track from the Walthamstow gig later appeared on a compilation of all three Battlezone albums, entitled &quot;Cessation of Hostilities&quot;. Ex-Battlezone bassist Gavin Cooper joined Lionsheart in December 2004, then moved onto Statetrooper in May 2005. The bassist subsequently joined the ranks of Magnum singer Bob Catley&#x27;s solo band for UK dates in April 2006.

In mid-2008, a Battlezone compilation entitled &quot;The Fight Goes On&quot; was released as on the Phantom Sound &amp; Vision label as a 3-CD box set featuring all three Battlezone studio albums.

=== Praying Mantis (1990) ===
After being dropped by BMG, Praying Mantis disbanded. Then, in a Spinal Tap–ish twist of fate, Paul Di&#x27;Anno called Dennis Stratton in 1989, about the Japanese wanting to have a ten-year anniversary of the new wave of British heavy metal. The band found themselves enjoying a renaissance in Tokyo, prompting a reformation and tour in April 1990, which yielded the &quot;Live at Last&quot; LP.

=== Killers (1990–1997, 2001–2003) ===

Killers was formed back in the summer of 1991. Cliff Evans was living in New York with Arnie Goodman, the manager of Fastway. Steve Hopgood, who played in Battlezone with Di&#x27;Anno previously, called Evans and outlined his plans for a new band. Di&#x27;Anno and Hopgood flew over to New York from the UK where they formed a band.

Within a few days, Killers had hired John Gallagher (from Raven) to play bass on a short-term basis. Former member of Drive She Said and New York session player Ray Detone was brought in on second guitar.

Shortly afterward, a live album called &quot;Assault on South America&quot; was recorded, featuring a number of Iron Maiden and Battlezone tracks and covers of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;. This was funded by Rock in Rio promoter Carlos Genesio and to be released primarily for the South American market. &quot;Recorded in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela in Summer of 1993&quot; is splashed on the back cover. However, according to John Gallagher, the South American tour fell through so the entire album was recorded on a mobile recording truck in New York. Later, a Canada-based record company called Magnetic Air Productions issued a pirate (bootleg) release worldwide, under a different cover, with no royalties being paid to the band.

Killers then played two days of showcases at Arnie Goodman&#x27;s New York City studio for several major record companies including Virgin, EMI, Sony and BMG. Representatives flew into New York from all over the world to see Killers play. They played only Iron Maiden songs because the band had not written any material. Maiden songs played included &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; and &quot;Wrathchild&quot; which evidently impressed a BMG representative enough to give the band a $250,000 contract. BMG were unaware that these songs had been recorded previously.

Once Killers had the record deal, they started to write the first album entitled &quot;Murder One&quot;. Rob Fraboni was recruited to produce the record. The band moved to Binghamton, where they stayed in a motel in which the owner had a set up rehearsal studio. The album was written in about in two weeks. Fraboni then took Killers to White Crow Audio (Burlington, Vermont) to record the drums which took about half a day. Finally, vocals and final mixing were performed at The Powerstation in New York.

Nick Burr left Killers after the completion of &quot;Murder One&quot; and was replaced by former Battlezone and Persian Risk guitarist Graham Bath. For the next 18 months the band toured around the world playing to fans all over Europe, Japan and coast to coast across the USA.

After the tour of &quot;Murder One&quot;, Killers returned to the UK while Di&#x27;Anno stayed in the US. Around this time, Di&#x27;Anno married an English girl, whom he flew into New York. Drugs and alcohol took their toll and the marriage quickly fell apart. Di&#x27;Anno left New York and moved in with his new American girlfriend in L.A. A fight between him and her involving a knife caught the attention of the police, who came into the apartment and arrested him for spousal abuse, cocaine possession and firearms offences. After a court appearance, he was sentenced to spend four months in an L.A. jail and Di&#x27;Anno was branded by the judge as a &#x27;menace to society&#x27;. It was here that Di&#x27;Anno began writing songs for the next Killers album and posting tapes back and forth to the UK, where the band were now living.

Di&#x27;Anno returned to the UK after being deported. It was here that the band was already signed to Bleeding Hearts records located in Newcastle, where they recorded their second studio album, entitled Menace to Society. The album had a more groove/thrash metal sound, and some critics compared this album to the works of Pantera and Machine Head. It was poorly received by many critics with the exception of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine in Germany who voted it as the &quot;Best New Album&quot; for that year.

By 2003, Di&#x27;Anno and Cliff Evans went on tour as the only original members of Killers remaining. Di&#x27;Anno hired new musicians whom he remembered from touring in Germany and Austria. Marcus Thurston joined the band as second guitarist, Darayus Kaye took over bass duties and Pete Newdeck on drums. Steve Hopgood had to retire as he developed tinnitus in his ears. The guitarist Graham Bath damaged his hands from playing so much over the years and developed arthritis. According to Di&#x27;Anno, he wanted Clive Burr (ex-Iron Maiden) on drums, but he could not get to rehearsals in time. Later on, Burr was to become severely ill from multiple sclerosis and died in 2013.

By 2004, Killers had disbanded. Cliff Evans, the former Killers guitarist and last original member of the band apart from Di&#x27;Anno, subsequently formed his own record company called Soundhouse Records and re-released the entire Killers back catalogue with the addition of another live album entitled &quot;Killers Live at the Marquee&quot; in 2008. &quot;Murder One&quot; album was reissued with 2 acoustic bonus tracks – &quot;Wrathchild&quot; and &quot;Dreamkeeper&quot;. Following this, Paul Di&#x27;Anno made both Killers studio albums available for download free of charge through his own website. Following legal action, Evans was forced to cease selling any Killers material on his label.

In December 2013, Paul Di&#x27;Anno and Cliff Evans announced that the band would regroup and release a new album entitled &quot;The Lazarus Syndrome&quot;. Producer Phil Kinmanm who had worked on Tank&#x27;s album &quot;War Nation&quot; was announced to be involved with the new project.

=== Nomad/Di&#x27;Anno (1999–2001, 2003–2008) ===
Following the demise of the new Battlezone unit put together in 1998, Di&#x27;Anno teamed up with expat Brazilian guitarist Paulo Turin and lived in São Paulo during 2000. A new band was created initially under the banner of &quot;Nomad&quot; and featured an all Brazilian line up. It was economically and logistically preferable for Di&#x27;Anno to live in Brazil during this period, in order to tour South America and release a self-produced album pleasing to that particular market. The album was distributed by Perris Records. However, complete worldwide distribution was not achieved.

The album was repackaged and released as &quot;The Living Dead&quot;. The package included a DVD video for the title track. This was recorded in the East London Docks and directed by Swedish director Mats Lundberg from Doom Films, who went to London to work on the concept with Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s manager Lea Hart. All of the special effects were added in Sweden and the story line was based on the lyrics and message of the song. Few previously released live Iron Maiden tracks were also added to the CD.

=== Running free in Norway Tour (2002) ===
In February 2002, Di&#x27;Anno had a mini-tour in Norway and visited Kroa in Volda, Samfundet in Trondheim, Betong in Oslo, Parkbiografen in Skien, Folken in Stavanger and Kvarteret in Bergen. The band was all Norwegian.

=== Rockfellas (2008–2010) ===
Late 2008, Di&#x27;Anno relocated to the southeast of Brazil and toured with a new band/project named Rockfellas with three Brazilian musicians: Jean Dolabella (drummer; ex-Diesel/Udora/Sepultura), Marcão (guitarist; of Charlie Brown Jr.) and Canisso (of Raimundos/ex-Rodox), playing rock &amp; roll and metal classics. There, he was nicknamed &quot;Paulo Baiano&quot; (&quot;Paulo&quot; = Paul in Portuguese, Baiano = Who was born in Bahia), being the &quot;Paulo Baiano&quot; nickname a pun/joke, for his name, Paul Di&#x27;Anno, is pronounced in a similar way to the nickname above.

=== The Swedish band (2005–2014) ===
In between 2005 and 2014, Di&#x27;Anno toured with his Swedish band in 13 countries in Europe, Asia and South America (Sweden, Venezuela, Finland, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Spain, Hungary, Bulgaria, India, Russia, Ukraine, Greece). 2005 they performed at the famous Gillmanfest, in Venezuela. 2006 Di&#x27;Anno recorded a cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song Kashmir (List of cover versions of Led Zeppelin songs) produced by Staffan Österlind.

The four Swedish musicians was: Mikael Fässberg (guitar) (Bonafide), Staffan Österlind (guitar) (Tuff, Black Robot), Martin Wezowski (bass), (Majestic), Carl Michael Hildesjö (drums). Mikael Fässberg was later replaced by Rasmus Ehrnborn (Soilwork, The Night Flight Orchestra), Martin Wezowski was replaced by Andreas Grufstedt and Carl Michael Hildesjö was replaced by Johan Helgesson.

=== Norwegian live band (2008–2024) ===
Early 2008, Di&#x27;Anno toured Norway and later Eastern Europe in 2009 with an all-Norwegian backing band consisting of musicians Henrik &quot;Rick&quot; Hagan (drums), Are Gogstad (bass), Jon Vegard Naess (guitar) and Anders Buaas (guitar).
Anders Buaas was later replaced by guitarist Rikard Nilsen.
The band went on to do several tours of Sweden, and made festival appearances at Hard Rock Hell (Wales, UK 2013), Voxbotn (Faroe Islands, Denmark 2013), Tons of Rock (Halden, Norway 2014), Sweden Rock Festival (Norje, Sweden 2014) and Rock Against Narcotics (Pune, India 2015), before doing a tour of Sweden in the summer of 2015. The band also toured with Blaze Bayley and Tim Ripper Owens.

=== 2010s ===
Di&#x27;Anno was, before being jailed in March 2011, recording a new solo album with Paulo Turin, the guitarist who worked on &quot;Feel My Pain&quot; and &quot;Nomad&quot;. The album was being produced by Dieter Roth in his studio in Germany. However, work on the album ceased due to record company problems.

He maintained an extensive world tour schedule, including two recent trips through America where traditional metal band Icarus Witch served as both his opening and backing band. In June 2012, Di&#x27;Anno was given the Freedom of the City of Bariloche in Argentina for charitable work carried out several years ago.

In 2014, Di&#x27;Anno sang on lead vocals on the bonus track &quot;Fuck You All&quot; on the album &quot;Big Trouble&quot; by hard rock band Hollywood Monsters. The album was released in 2014 on Mausoleum Records and featured Steph Honde on vocals and guitars, Vinny Appice on drums, Tim Bogert on bass and Don Airey on keyboards.

Despite planning to retire in 2013, Di&#x27;Anno scrapped his retirement plans in August 2014 and released a new album with his new band, Architects of Chaoz, called &quot;The League of Shadows&quot;.

In 2015, he returned to Brazil on his tour &quot;The Beast is Back&quot;, saying that this would be his last in the country. In this tour, the singer was accompanied by musicians from Rio de Janeiro, Vinnie Tex (guitar), Thiago Velasquez (bass) and drummer Braulio Drumond; they currently part of the North American Leather Leone&#x27;s band. Di&#x27;Anno made eight presentations around the country. These members would be part of the new band, however due to health problems, the singer had to pause activities and the project in standby.

The same year, Di&#x27;Anno was interviewed extensively for the book &quot;Iron Maiden: 80 81&quot;, by author Greg Prato.

In May 2016, Di&#x27;Anno was hospitalised for undisclosed medical issues and was forced to cancel his previously announced June 2016 tour of Brazil. According to the tour&#x27;s promoter, Blog n Roll Produções, Di&#x27;Anno is undergoing a series of tests to help ensure an accurate diagnosis and identify an appropriate course of treatment.

On 29 October 2017, Di&#x27;Anno joined The Iron Maidens on stage for their encore at the O2 Academy in Islington, London, performing &quot;Wrathchild&quot; and &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;. Di&#x27;Anno appeared in a wheelchair.

=== 2020s ===
Di&#x27;Anno was due to make his final performance on 30 August 2020 at the Beermageddon Festival in Bromsgrove, England, before he retired from touring, though he did not clarify on whether he intended to continue to record music. This appearance was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the festival dates rescheduled for August 2021. However, on 7 June 2021, Paul and the Ides of March band were removed from the line up with the following statement: &quot;We here at Beermageddon are gutted to announce Ides of March will no longer be appearing at this years festival, we had been struggling to contact the band or management and just over a week ago had the news that the planned project will not be going ahead and as such the band will not appear at Beermageddon 2021. We were so looking forward to Paul Di&#x27;Anno and a lineup of past Iron Maiden members gracing the Geddon stage, it would have been one of the most memorable festival appearances we have ever had, but sadly it isn&#x27;t to be. I know many of you had huge anticipation for Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s farewell show, and we feel your pain, but we do promise Beermageddon will still be the fantastic festival it always is.&quot;

On 21 May 2022, Di&#x27;Anno performed his first live show in 7 years with the Norwegian live band at Bikers Beer Factory in Zagreb, Croatia.

In August 2023, it was announced that Di&#x27;Anno would release a new album for BraveWords Records in 2024 under the name Paul Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s Warhorse.

On 27 September 2024, Di&#x27;Anno released his first career retrospective, &quot;The Book of the Beast&quot; on Conquest Music. This best of was available as limited edition 2-LP sets in coloured vinyl, along with a CD+DVD set consisting of new masters of his best post-Iron Maiden recordings and some previously unreleased material. Also included were Di&#x27;Anno singing duets with Tony Martin (Black Sabbath) and ZP Theart (Dragonforce).

A documentary film on Di&#x27;Anno by Wes Orshoski has been in the making for several years and is intended to be ready for festival screenings in 2025.

== Singing style ==
In comparison to the operatic vocals of Bruce Dickinson, his successor in Iron Maiden, Di&#x27;Anno is remembered for having a more guttural &quot;punk&quot; sound to his singing, in part because he began his singing career in punk band the Paedophiles. He usually sang with a raspy and rougher sound, although he was capable of singing with a purer voice as demonstrated by slower numbers like &quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Strange World&quot; and &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;.

Later in his career, Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s style, along with his music, became darker and more aggressive, diverging further from Iron Maiden&#x27;s sound which was becoming more progressive.

== Personal life==
Di&#x27;Anno married five times and had six children.

Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s religious affiliation was made uncertain by his own words; he gave interviews that contradicted each other on this subject, perhaps as a practical joke. He had a tattoo on the back of his head that said &quot;666&quot; and &quot;GOD = SUCKER&quot;. According to his autobiography, he converted to Islam in the 1990s after reading the Quran. However, he later reversed that position, saying &quot;I think religion kills everybody. I don&#x27;t believe in it... No, my father was a Muslim, I must admit. But I don&#x27;t give a fuck.&quot; In later interviews, Di&#x27;Anno clarified that he never was a true Muslim, that he never stopped drinking, but tried to become a better person by applying some of the Muslim philosophies to his life. His autobiography furthers the confusion: in various passages he claimed to be Muslim, Catholic, Jewish, and Aboriginal.

In February 2011, Di&#x27;Anno was convicted on eight counts of benefit fraud for claiming more than £45,000 under false pretences. On 11 March 2011, he was jailed for nine months at Salisbury Crown Court. He only served two of the nine months to which he was sentenced, being released early for good behaviour.

=== Autobiography ===
Di&#x27;Anno released an autobiography titled &quot;The Beast&quot; (). The book includes a chapter of stories and comments regarding Di&#x27;Anno written by former bandmates including Dennis Stratton, John Wiggins and Steve Hopgood. The book was controversial for its portrayal of his abuse of various drugs, many accounts of Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s violence towards people, and the explanation of his ban from America.

=== Other interests ===
Di&#x27;Anno had several businesses outside the music industry, including an internet café and a hotel/restaurant in England, both of which he sold. He was latterly resident in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

== Illness and death ==
A crowdfunder was launched in January 2021 to help raise money for the singer&#x27;s knee surgery, following several years of poor health. In September 2021, it was reported that Di&#x27;Anno was still waiting for the surgery, and a photo surfaced of the singer showing his badly swollen leg. In October 2021, the crowdfunding had reached its target to which Di&#x27;Anno heartily thanked everyone for their support. In November 2021, Di&#x27;Anno relocated to Croatia to undergo treatment and surgery for his knee. Following the successful surgery, Di&#x27;Anno confirmed reports that Iron Maiden helped pay for the final part of his treatment in Croatia.

Di&#x27;Anno died at his Salisbury home, on 21 October 2024, at the age of 66. Record label Conquest Music confirmed his death the same day, and stated that Di&#x27;Anno died after &quot;being troubled by severe health issues in recent years that restricted him to performing in a wheelchair&quot;. His sisters Cheryl and Michelle confirmed the following: &#x27;Basically he had a tear in the sac around the heart and blood has filled inside it from the main aorta artery and that has caused the heart to stop.&#x27;

== Legacy and tributes ==
A tribute show was held in Di&#x27;Anno&#x27;s honor on November 7, 2024 at Underworld Camden, featuring performances by Electric Gypsy, Gypsy’s Kiss, and Hi-On Maiden (all of whom were slated to support Di&#x27;Anno on a planned tour that was cancelled due to his death).

<text>The introduction of the reformed examination system in Scotland in 2000 was criticised in the press and by the Government after a series of administrative and computer errors led to several thousand incorrect Higher and Intermediate certificates being sent out by post. The crisis took several months to resolve, and several management figures including the Chief Executive, Ron Tuck, resigned or lost their jobs as a result.

== Timeline ==

*26 June 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority announces &#x27;teething problems&#x27; with the marking system, but promises that students will receive their results on time.

*9 August 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority publicly admits that pupils sitting Higher Grade examinations may not receive the correct results.

*10 August 2000
Thousands of students across Scotland receive incomplete or inaccurate exam results. Schools are left in disarray as 5% of all schools have not been sent &quot;any&quot; results at all, accurate or otherwise.

*12 August 2000
Ron Tuck, the Chief Executive of the Scottish Qualifications Authority, resigns, stating his regret and accepting responsibility for &quot;this unfortunate episode&quot;. The Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition Scottish Executive ignores demands by the Scottish National Party for Sam Galbraith, the Education Minister, to resign.

*13 August 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority and Scottish Executive claim that the errors are due to the correct results being incorrectly collated, due to a serious fault in the new computer programme, not exams being marked wrongly in the first place.

*14 August 2000
Bill Morton is appointed as acting Chief Executive, to replace Ron Tuck, who resigned.

*15 August 2000
Students are assured that their marks will not go down. However this leaves a problem for UCAS, which has no way of knowing if students with high grades actually earned them or not. UCAS accepted the validity of all results.

*18 August 2000
UCAS admits in a statement that many of the students whose certificates contained errors could lose out on a university place that they would have received had the results been accurate and on time.

*20 August 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority claims that over 2,000 students with inaccurate certificates will receive the correct ones the next day, and the rest will be fixed &#x27;in a matter of days.&#x27;

*22 August 2000
Now realising that 21 August was not a realistic deadline, the Scottish Qualifications Authority vow to sort out the worst affected pupils&#x27; results by 20 September 2000.

*27 August 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority sorts out Higher Grade exam results.

*28 August 2000
Bill Morton orders an internal investigation at the Scottish Qualifications Authority.

*29 August 2000
Over 4,000 Standard Grade students are discovered to have received incorrect certificates.

*29 October 2000
Jack McConnell becomes the new Education Minister. Sam Galbraith is removed to Environment Minister.

*31 October 2000
A leak reveals that the Scottish Qualifications Authority failed to sort out non-urgent Higher Grade exam results within the planned deadline—and the new Chief Executive was not told.

*9 November 2000
Jack McConnell appoints a new Scottish Qualifications Authority board. 16 of the 24 members have been replaced.

*25 November 2000
The Scottish Qualifications Authority begins sending out accurate exam certificates to students—three months after they were supposed to be delivered.

*10 August 2001
Media reports suggest that the exam results fiasco cost the people of Scotland over £11,000,000.

*10 January 2002

It emerged that an eighteen-year-old student has decided to sue the Scottish Qualifications Authority for compensation after she spent her time retaking a subject she had passed in, but wasn&#x27;t notified about it until nine months later.

<doc id="674453" wikidata="Q548004" url="?curid=674453" title="Hugh Walpole">
<text>Sir Hugh Seymour Walpole, CBE (13 March 18841 June 1941) was an English novelist. He was the son of an Anglican clergyman, intended for a career in the church but drawn instead to writing. Among those who encouraged him were the authors Henry James and Arnold Bennett. His skill at scene-setting and vivid plots, as well as his high profile as a lecturer, brought him a large readership in the United Kingdom and North America. He was a best-selling author in the 1920s and 1930s but has been largely neglected since his death.

After his first novel, &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, producing at least one book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. His first novel to achieve major success was his third, &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot;, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War he served in the Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.

As a gay man at a time when homosexual practices were illegal for men in Britain, Walpole conducted a succession of intense but discreet relationships with other men, and was for much of his life in search of what he saw as &quot;the perfect friend&quot;. He eventually found one, a married policeman, with whom he settled in the English Lake District. Having as a young man eagerly sought the support of established authors, he was in his later years a generous sponsor of many younger writers. He was a patron of the visual arts and bequeathed a substantial legacy of paintings to the Tate Gallery and other British institutions.

Walpole&#x27;s output was large and varied. Between 1909 and 1941 he wrote thirty-six novels, five volumes of short stories, two original plays and three volumes of memoirs. His range included disturbing studies of the macabre, children&#x27;s stories and historical fiction, most notably his &quot;Herries Chronicle&quot; series, set in the Lake District. He worked in Hollywood writing scenarios for two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films in the 1930s, and had a cameo in the 1935 film adaptation of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Walpole was born in Auckland, New Zealand, the eldest of three children of the Rev Somerset Walpole and his wife, Mildred Helen, &quot;née&quot; Barham (1854–1925). Somerset Walpole had been an assistant to the Bishop of Truro, Edward White Benson, from 1877 until 1882, when he was offered the incumbency of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Auckland; on Benson&#x27;s advice he accepted.

Mildred Walpole found it hard to settle in New Zealand, and something of her restlessness and insecurity affected the character of her eldest child. In 1889, two years after the birth of the couple&#x27;s daughter, Dorothea (&quot;Dorothy&quot;), Somerset Walpole accepted a prominent and well-paid academic post at the General Theological Seminary, New York. Robert (&quot;Robin&quot;), the third of the couple&#x27;s children, was born in New York in 1892. Hugh and Dorothy were taught by a governess until the middle of 1893, when the parents decided that he needed an English education.

Walpole was sent to England, where according to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis the next ten years were the unhappiest time of Walpole&#x27;s life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase&#x27;s Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, &quot;The food was inadequate, the morality was &#x27;twisted&#x27;, and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages ... The excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect I suffered there&quot;.

In 1896 Somerset Walpole discovered his son&#x27;s horror of the Marlow school and he moved him to the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. For two years he was a fairly content, though undistinguished, pupil there. In 1897 Walpole senior was appointed principal of Bede College, Durham, and Hugh was moved again, to be a day boy for four years at Durham School. He found that day boys were looked down on by boarders, and that Bede College was the subject of snobbery within the university. His sense of isolation increased. He continually took refuge in the local library, where he read all the novels of Jane Austen, Henry Fielding, Scott and Dickens and many of the works of Trollope, Wilkie Collins and Henry Kingsley. Walpole wrote in 1924:

Though Walpole was no admirer of the schools he had attended there, the cathedral cities of Truro, Canterbury and Durham made a strong impression on him. He drew on aspects of them for his fictional cathedral city of Polchester in Glebeshire, the setting of many of his later books. Walpole&#x27;s memories of his time at Canterbury grew mellower over the years; it was the only school he mentioned in his &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; entry.

=== Cambridge, Liverpool and teaching ===

From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied history at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there he had his first work published, the critical essay &quot;Two Meredithian Heroes&quot;, which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell under the spell of A.C.Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole&#x27;s religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: &quot;[H]e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone in the world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching... It is quite right that he should believe all this passionately; it is quite right that I should know that it will not last ... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could...&quot;

Benson gently declined Walpole&#x27;s advances. They remained friends, but Walpole, rebuffed in his &quot;excessive desire to be loved&quot;, turned the full force of his enthusiasms elsewhere, and the relationship with Benson became less important to him. Less than two years later Benson&#x27;s diary entry on Walpole&#x27;s subsequent social career reveals his thoughts on his protégé&#x27;s progress:

With Benson&#x27;s help, Walpole had come to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too concerned for his father&#x27;s feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the &quot;greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type.&quot; The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.

From April to July 1907 Walpole was in Germany, tutoring the children of the popular author Elizabeth von Arnim. In 1908 he taught French at Epsom College. His brief experience of teaching is reflected in his third novel, &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot;. As well as the clerical forebears, Walpole had notable authors in his family tree: on his father&#x27;s side, the novelist and letter writer Horace Walpole, and on his mother&#x27;s Richard Harris Barham, author of &quot;The Ingoldsby Legends&quot;. It was as an author that Walpole felt impelled to make his career. He moved to London and found work as a book reviewer for &quot;The Standard&quot;, writing fiction in his spare time. He had by this time recognised unreservedly that he was homosexual. His encounters were necessarily discreet, as such activities were illegal in Britain, and remained so throughout his lifetime. He was constantly searching for &quot;the perfect friend&quot;; an early candidate was the stage designer Percy Anderson, to whom he was intimately attached for some time from 1910 onwards.

=== Early literary career ===
A. C. Benson was a friend of Henry James, to whom Walpole wrote a fan letter late in 1908, with Benson&#x27;s encouragement. A correspondence ensued and in February 1909 James invited Walpole to lunch at the Reform Club in London. They developed a close friendship, described by James&#x27;s biographer Leon Edel as resembling a father and son relationship in some, but not all, respects. James was greatly taken with the young Walpole, though clear-eyed about the deficiencies in the artistry and craftsmanship of his protégé&#x27;s early efforts. According to Somerset Maugham, Walpole made a sexual proposition to James, who was too inhibited to respond. Nevertheless, in their correspondence the older man&#x27;s devotion was couched in extravagant terms.

Walpole published his first novel, &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, in 1909. It told of a staid and snobbish English family shaken up by the return of one of its members from a less hidebound life in New Zealand. The book received good reviews but barely repaid the cost of having it typed. His first commercial success was &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot;, published in 1911. The novelist and biographer Michael Sadleir writes that though some of the six novels Walpole wrote between 1909 and 1914 are of interest as examples of the author&#x27;s developing style, it is &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot; that deserves to be remembered for its own sake. The book, subtitled &quot;a tragi-comedy&quot;, is a psychological study of a deadly clash between two schoolmasters, one an ageing failure and the other a young, attractive idealist. In the view of Hart-Davis, Walpole only once recaptured &quot;the fresh, clear cut realism&quot; of this book, and Walpole himself, looking back on his work in the 1930s, felt that of all his books to date, it was the truest. &quot;The Observer&quot; gave the book a favourable review: &quot;The slow growth of the poison within [Perrin] is traced with wonderful skill and sympathy ... one feels throughout these pages a sense of intolerable tension, of impending disaster&quot;; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; was less enthusiastic, praising the scene-setting but calling the story &quot;an unconscientious melodrama&quot;. &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised its &quot;technical excellence, imagination and beauty – Walpole at his best.&quot; Arnold Bennett, a well-established novelist seventeen years Walpole&#x27;s senior, admired the book, and befriended the young author, regularly chiding, encouraging, sometimes mocking him into improving his prose, characters and narratives.

The &quot;Guardian&quot; reviewer observed that the setting of &quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot; – a second-rate public school – was clearly drawn from life, as indeed it was. The boys of Epsom College were delighted with the thinly disguised version of their school, but the college authorities were not, and Walpole was &quot;persona non grata&quot; at Epsom for many years. This was of no practical consequence, as he had no intention of returning to the teaching profession, but it was an early illustration of his capacity, noted by Benson, for unthinkingly giving offence, though being hypersensitive to criticism himself.

In early 1914 James wrote an article for &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; surveying the younger generation of British novelists and comparing them with their eminent elder contemporaries. In the latter category James put Bennett, Joseph Conrad, John Galsworthy, Maurice Hewlett and HGWells. The four new authors on whom he focused were Walpole, Gilbert Cannan, Compton Mackenzie and D H Lawrence. It was a very lengthy article, to the extent that it had to be spread across two issues of the Supplement in March and April 1914. James said that agreeing to write it had been &quot;an insensate step&quot;, but from Walpole&#x27;s point of view it was highly satisfactory: one of the greatest living authors had publicly ranked him among the finest young British novelists.

=== First World War ===

As war approached, Walpole realised that his poor eyesight would disqualify him from serving in the armed forces. He volunteered to join the police, but was turned down; he then accepted a journalistic appointment based in Moscow, reporting for &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; and &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;. He was allowed to visit the front in Poland, but his dispatches from Moscow (and later from Petrograd, which he preferred) were not enough to stop hostile comments at home that he was not doing his bit for the war effort. Henry James was so incensed at one such remark by a prominent London hostess that he stormed out of her house and wrote to Walpole suggesting that he should return to England. Walpole replied in great excitement that he had just been appointed as a Russian officer, in the Sanitar:

While in training for the Sanitar, Walpole devoted his leisure hours to gaining a reasonable fluency in the Russian language, and to his first full-length work of non-fiction, a literary biography of Joseph Conrad. In the summer of 1915 he worked on the Austrian-Russian front, assisting at operations in field hospitals and retrieving the dead and wounded from the battlefield. Occasionally he found time to write brief letters home; he told Bennett, &quot;A battle is an amazing mixture of hell and a family picnic – not as frightening as the dentist, but absorbing, sometimes thrilling like football, sometimes dull like church, and sometimes simply physically sickening like bad fish. Burying dead afterwards is worst of all.&quot; When disheartened he comforted himself with the thought, &quot;This is not so bad as it was at Marlow&quot;.

During an engagement early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused to help and Walpole carried one end of a stretcher and dragged the man to safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty he returned to Petrograd. Among the city&#x27;s attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed an intimate relationship. Throughout his time in Petrograd and Moscow he kept a diary of the books he read and the plays and operas he attended, a habit that continued throughout his life. He met Maxim Gorky, Mikhail Lykiardopoulos, Nikita Baliev and immersed himself in the Moscow art scene which influenced the Symbolism in his work. He remained in Russia until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of &quot;The Daily News&quot;, had successfully lobbied for the establishment of a bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.

Before he left for Petrograd, Walpole&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dark Forest&quot; was published. It drew on his experiences in Russia, and was more sombre than much of his earlier fiction. Reviews were highly favourable; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; commented on &quot;a high level of imaginative vision... reveals capacity and powers in the author which we had hardly suspected before.&quot;

Walpole returned to Petrograd in February 1916. He moved into Somov&#x27;s flat, and his Anglo-Russian Propaganda Bureau began work. The following month he suffered a personal blow: he recorded in his diary for 13 March 1916, &quot;Thirty two to-day! Should have been a happy day but was completely clouded for me by reading in the papers of Henry James&#x27; death. This was a terrible shock to me.&quot; Walpole remained at the bureau for the rest of 1916 and most of 1917, witnessing the February Revolution. He wrote an official report on events for the Foreign Office, and also absorbed ideas for his fiction. In addition to the first of his popular &quot;Jeremy&quot; novels, written in his spare time from the bureau, he began work on the second of his Russian-themed books, &quot;The Secret City&quot;. Sadleir writes that this novel and &quot;The Dark Forest&quot; &quot;take a high place among his works, on account of their intuitive understanding of an alien mentality and the vigour of their narrative power.&quot; The book won the inaugural James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.

By late 1917 it was clear to Walpole and to the British authorities that there was little advantage in keeping him in Russia. On 7 November he left, missing the Bolshevik Revolution, which began on that day. He was appointed to a post at the Foreign Office in its Department of Information, headed by John Buchan. Soon after returning he volunteered for the British Army, but, as expected, failed the necessary medical examination because of his poor sight. He continued to work in British propaganda when the department was reconstituted under Lord Beaverbrook in April 1918, and remained there for the rest of the war and beyond, resigning in February 1919. Little is known about what he wrote for the department, as most of its records were destroyed after the war, but he noted in his diary that he had written the department&#x27;s official report to the War Cabinet: &quot;a beastly job – the worst I&#x27;ve ever attempted&quot;. For his wartime work he was awarded the CBE in 1918.

=== Post-war and 1920s ===

Walpole remained prolific in the post-war years, and began a parallel and highly remunerative career as a lecturer in literature. At the instigation of his American publisher, George Doran, he made his first lecture tour of the US in 1919, receiving an enthusiastic welcome wherever he went. What Sadleir describes as Walpole&#x27;s &quot;genial and attractive appearance, his complete lack of aloofness, his exciting fluency as a speaker [and] his obvious and genuine liking for his hosts&quot; combined to win him a large American following. The success of his talks led to increases in his lecturing fees, greatly enhanced sales of his books, and large sums from American publishers anxious to print his latest fiction. He was a prodigiously quick writer who seldom revised, but pressed on, keen to get his ideas down on paper. His main British publishers, Macmillan, found it expedient to appoint a senior member of staff to edit his manuscripts, correcting spelling, punctuation, inconsistencies and errors of historical fact. His fluency enabled him to fulfil between tours a contract from &quot;The Pictorial Review&quot; for ten short stories at the remarkable sum of $1,350 apiece.

One of Walpole&#x27;s major novels of the early post-war period was &quot;The Cathedral&quot;, which unlike much of his fiction was not dashed off but worked on across four years, beginning in 1918. The story of an arrogant 19th-century archdeacon in conflict with other clergy and laity was certain to bring comparisons with Trollope&#x27;s &quot;Barchester Towers&quot; (&quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s review was headed &quot;Polchester Towers&quot;), but unlike the earlier work, &quot;The Cathedral&quot; is wholly uncomic. The hubristic Archdeacon Brandon is driven to domestic despair, professional defeat and sudden death. The reviewer Ivor Brown commented that Walpole had earlier charmed many with his cheerful tales of Mayfair, but that in this novel he showed a greater side to his art: &quot;This is a book with little happiness about it, but its stark strength is undeniable. &quot;The Cathedral&quot; is realism, profound in its philosophy and delicate in its thread.&quot; &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; said, &quot;No former novelist has seized quite so powerfully upon the cathedral fabric and made it a living character in the drama, an obsessing individuality at once benign and forbidding...&quot;The Cathedral&quot; is a great book.&quot;

Walpole was a keen music lover and when in 1920 he heard a new tenor at the Proms he was much impressed and sought him out. Lauritz Melchior became one of the most important friendships of his life, and Walpole did much to foster the singer&#x27;s budding career. Wagner&#x27;s son Siegfried engaged Melchior for the Bayreuth Festival in 1924 and succeeding years. Walpole attended, and met Adolf Hitler, then recently released from prison after an attempted putsch. Hitler was a protégé of Siegfried&#x27;s wife Winifred, and was known in Bayreuth as &quot;one of Winnie&#x27;s lame ducks.&quot; Walpole later admitted that he had both despised and liked him – &quot;both emotions that time has proved I was wrong to indulge&quot;. This and future visits to Bayreuth were complicated by the fact that Winifred Wagner fell in love with Walpole, and attached herself so firmly to him that rumours began to spread.

In 1924 Walpole moved into a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to maintain his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, on the slopes of Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home for the rest of his life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole&#x27;s stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole&#x27;s life. In Hart-Davis&#x27;s words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole&#x27;s long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole&#x27;s service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.
During the mid-twenties Walpole produced two of his best-known novels in the macabre vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. &quot;The Old Ladies&quot; (1924) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow. &quot;Portrait of a Man with Red Hair&quot; (1925) depicts the malign influence of a manipulative, insane father on his family and others. Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank Swinnerton as &quot;a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write, and won&#x27;t bore you to read.&quot; In contrast he continued a series of stories for children, begun in 1919 with &quot;Jeremy&quot;, taking the young hero&#x27;s story forward with &quot;Jeremy and Hamlet&quot; (the latter being the boy&#x27;s dog) in 1923, and &quot;Jeremy at Crale&quot; in 1927. Sadleir, writing in the 1950s, suggests that &quot;the most real Walpole of all – because the most unselfconscious, kindly, and understanding friend – is the Walpole of the Jeremy trilogy.&quot; Of his other novels of the 1920s &quot;Wintersmoon&quot; (1928), his first attempt at a full-length love story, portrays a clash between traditionalism and modernism: his own sympathies, though not spelled out, were clearly with the traditionalists.

=== 1930–1941 ===

By the 1930s, though his public success remained considerable, many literary critics saw Walpole as outdated. His reputation in literary circles took a blow from a malicious caricature in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s 1930 novel &quot;Cakes and Ale&quot;: the character Alroy Kear, a superficial novelist of more pushy ambition than literary talent, was widely taken to be based on Walpole. In the same year Walpole wrote possibly his best-known work, &quot;Rogue Herries&quot;, a historical novel set in the Lake District. It was well-received: &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; considered it &quot;not only a profound study of human character, but a subtle and intimate biography of a place.&quot; He followed it with three sequels; all four novels were published in a single volume as &quot;The Herries Chronicle&quot;.

In 1934 Walpole accepted an invitation from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios to go to Hollywood to write the scenario for a film adaptation of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. He enjoyed many aspects of life in Hollywood, but as one who rarely revised any of his own work he found it tedious to produce sixth and seventh drafts at the behest of the studio. He enjoyed his brief change of role from writer to bit-part player: in the film he played the Vicar of Blunderstone delivering a boring sermon that sends David to sleep. Agate was doubtful of the wisdom of this: &quot;Does not Hugh see that to bring a well-known character from real life into an imaginary sequence of events is to destroy the reality of that imaginary sequence?&quot; Nevertheless, Walpole&#x27;s performance was a success. He improvised the sermon; the producer, David O Selznick, mischievously called for retake after retake to try to make him dry up, but Walpole fluently delivered a different extempore address each time.

The critical and commercial success of the film of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. When he got there he found that the studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot;, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.

In 1937 Walpole was offered a knighthood. He accepted, though confiding to his diary that he could not think of a good novelist since Walter Scott who had done so. &quot;Kipling, Hardy, Galsworthy all refused. But I&#x27;m not of their class, and range with Doyle, Anthony Hope and such... Besides I shall like being a knight.&quot;

Walpole&#x27;s taste for adventure did not diminish in his last years. In 1939 he was commissioned to report for William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspapers on the funeral in Rome of Pope Pius XI, the conclave to elect his successor, and the subsequent coronation. A fellow correspondent was Tom Driberg, whose memoirs tell of a lunch &quot;à deux&quot; at which Walpole arrived flushed with excitement from a sexual encounter that morning with an attendant in the Borghese Palace. In the weeks between the funeral and Pius XII&#x27;s election Walpole, with his customary fluency, wrote much of his book &quot;Roman Fountain&quot;, a mixture of fact and fiction about the city. This was his last overseas visit.

After the outbreak of the Second World War Walpole remained in England, dividing his time between London and Keswick, and continuing to write with his usual rapidity. He completed a fifth novel in the Herries series and began work on a sixth. His health was undermined by diabetes. He overexerted himself at the opening of Keswick&#x27;s fund-raising &quot;War Weapons Week&quot; in May 1941, making a speech after taking part in a lengthy march, and died of a heart attack at Brackenburn, aged 57. He is buried in St John&#x27;s churchyard in Keswick.

=== Legacy ===
Walpole was a keen and discerning collector of art. Sir Kenneth Clark called him &quot;one of the three or four real patrons of art in this country, and of that small body he was perhaps the most generous and the most discriminating.&quot; He left fourteen works to the Tate Gallery and Fitzwilliam Museum, including paintings by Cézanne, Manet, Augustus John, Tissot and Renoir.
 Other artists represented in Walpole&#x27;s collection were Epstein, Picasso, Gauguin, Sickert and Utrillo. After his death the finest works in his collection, other than those bequeathed, were exhibited in London during April and May 1945; the exhibition also included works by Constable, Turner and Rodin.

Sadleir notes how Walpole&#x27;s considerable income enabled him to indulge not only his love of art and of old books and manuscripts, but also philanthropy, particularly towards younger writers. Although Walpole enjoyed the limelight, he was secretive about his many acts of generosity to younger writers, with both encouragement and financial help. After his death some idea of the scale of his generosity was discovered. Osbert Sitwell commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was any younger writer of any worth who has not at one time or another received kindness of an active kind, and at a crucial moment, from Hugh&quot;. Hart-Davis lists thirty-eight authors from whom letters of gratitude were found among Walpole&#x27;s correspondence; Sadleir writes of Walpole&#x27;s &quot;generous kindness to literary aspirants and to writers fallen on evil days... by immediate financial assistance, by prefaces freely supplied or by collaboration volunteered, by introductions and recommendations to likely publishers, Walpole relieved the distresses of authorship to a degree which will never be fully known.&quot; Agate, though himself the recipient of Walpole&#x27;s generosity on occasion, thought it sometimes went too far: &quot;Mr Walpole&#x27;s large-heartedness gets him into all kinds of trouble. He is an inveterate patter. He pats on the back young men whom sterner critics would knock down, because even in fantastic incompetence he perceives the good intention. No art or artist is safe from Mr Walpole&#x27;s benevolence&quot;.

In his adopted home of Keswick a section of the town museum was dedicated to Walpole&#x27;s memory in 1949, with manuscripts, correspondence, paintings and sculpture from Brackenburn, donated by his sister and brother.

The Hugh Walpole Society was founded in 2020 to promote the appreciation and study of Walpole&#x27;s life and works. As well as publishing a journal, &quot;The Hugh Walpole Review&quot;, twice a year, the society also arranges in-person events for members in locations with Walpole associations. It is a member of the Alliance of Literary Societies, the Friends of Keswick Museum and Art Gallery and also of St John&#x27;s Church, Keswick where he is buried.
In 2023 the society published &quot;Red Amber and Other Stories&quot;, a volume of twelve uncollected short stories.

== Works ==

Walpole&#x27;s books cover a wide range. His fiction includes short stories, bildungsromane (&quot;Mr Perrin and Mr Traill&quot;, 1911, and the &quot;Jeremy&quot; trilogy) that delve into the psychology of boyhood; gothic horror novels (&quot;Portrait of a Man with Red Hair&quot;, 1925, and &quot;The Killer and the Slain&quot;, 1942); ghost stories (&quot;All Souls&#x27; Night&quot;, 1933); a period family saga (the Herries chronicle) and even detective fiction (&quot;Behind the Screen&quot;). He wrote literary biographies (Conrad, 1916; James Branch Cabell, 1920; and Trollope, 1928); plays; and screenplays including &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, 1935.

=== Influences ===

Walpole&#x27;s debt to Henry James is discernible in &quot;The Duchess of Wrexe&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Green Mirror&quot; (1917), but in the view of JBPriestley the two most potent influences on Walpole were the highly contrasting ones of Trollope and Dostoyevsky. Other critics noted the Trollopian influence; in 1923 Arthur St John Adcock commented:

Walpole, though he was devoted to the works of Trollope, and published a study of him, thought that there was no real comparison between the two of them: &quot;I am far too twisted and fantastic a novelist ever to succeed in catching Trollope&#x27;s marvellous normality.&quot; Priestley was less impressed by the supposed Trollopian side of Walpole&#x27;s work, finding some of it formulaic. He was more taken with a darker, Dostoyevskian, side that he found in the writing: &quot;suddenly it will transform the pleasant easy scene he is giving us into transparency behind which are bright stars and red hellfire ... No matter how jolly and zestful he may appear to be, the fact remains that he possesses an unusually sharp sense of evil.&quot;

Possibly the most pervasive influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism is reflected in much of the later writer&#x27;s fiction. Such was Walpole&#x27;s love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter&#x27;s reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had been out of fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.

=== Reputation ===

Walpole sought critical as well as financial success, and longed to write works that equalled those of Trollope, Thomas Hardy and Henry James. In his early days, he received frequent and generally approving scrutiny from major literary figures. He was a good friend of Virginia Woolf, and rated her as an influence; she praised his gift for seizing on telling detail: &quot;it is no disparagement to a writer to say that his gift is for the small things rather than for the large ... If you are faithful with the details the large effects will grow inevitably out of those very details&quot;. Joseph Conrad said of him, &quot;We see Mr. Walpole grappling with the truth of things spiritual and material with his characteristic earnestness, and we can discern the characteristics of this acute and sympathetic explorer of human nature.&quot; In 1928 Priestley observed,

Priestley contended that Walpole had fulfilled his early potential, unlike Compton Mackenzie, Gilbert Cannan and other promising young novelists of his generation. This view was not universal among critics: Walpole sometimes divided opinion. Writing of Walpole&#x27;s Russian novels the contemporary critic and novelist Douglas Goldring commented, &quot;Russia has been the grave of many reputations; and our Napoleon of the drawing-room novel has fared no better than other would-be conquerors of that disconcerting land.&quot; Goldring&#x27;s complaint was that Walpole&#x27;s Russian (and English) characters were clichéd stereotypes. The reviewer in &quot;Punch&quot;, by contrast, wrote, &quot;I consulted a Russian, who is very much alive, and received the opinion that, if Mr. Walpole has not succeeded in drawing the real average Russian, he has given us a type whose faults and virtues sound the keynote of the situation as it is to-day.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; rated &quot;The Dark Forest&quot; as &quot;one of the finest novels of our generation&quot;.
In 1924 Ernest Hemingway wrote into a short story a comparison of G. K. Chesterton and Walpole, concluding that the former was the better man, the latter a better writer and both were classics. Walpole could be sensitive about his literary reputation and often took adverse criticism badly. When Hilaire Belloc praised P.G.Wodehouse as the best English writer of their day, Walpole took it amiss, to the amusement of Wodehouse who regarded Belloc&#x27;s plaudit as &quot;a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked&quot;. Wodehouse was not a great admirer of Walpole; his own scrupulous craftsmanship, with drafts polished over and over again, was the opposite of Walpole&#x27;s hastily written and seldom-revised prose. He also viewed Walpole&#x27;s sensitivity to criticism as absurd. Walpole was not always as oversensitive as Wodehouse supposed. The critic James Agate was a friend despite his regular rude remarks about Walpole&#x27;s prose, and when Walpole discovered that Agate had written a spoof of the Herries &quot;Lakeland&quot; style, he made him promise to print it in the next published volume of his diaries.

During his career contemporaries saw both negative and positive sides to Walpole&#x27;s outgoing nature and desire to be in the public eye. Wodehouse commented, &quot;I always think Hugh Walpole&#x27;s reputation was two thirds publicity. He was always endorsing books and speaking at lunches and so on.&quot; On the other hand, Walpole stood out as one of the few literary figures willing to go into court and give evidence for the defence at the obscenity trial after the 1928 lesbian novel by Radclyffe Hall, &quot;The Well of Loneliness&quot;, was published.

By the time of his death &quot;The Times&quot;″s estimation of Walpole was no higher than, &quot;he had a versatile imagination; he could tell a workmanlike story in good workmanlike English; and he was a man of immense industry, conscientious and painstaking&quot;. The belittling tone of the obituary brought forth strong rebuttals from T S Eliot, Kenneth Clark and Priestley, among others. Within a few years of his death, Walpole was seen as old-fashioned, and his works were largely neglected. In the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; Elizabeth Steele summed up: &quot;His psychology was not deep enough for the polemicist, his diction not free enough for those returning from war, and his zest disastrous to a public wary of personal commitment&quot;.

Walpole&#x27;s works have not been completely neglected in recent years. The Herries stories have seldom been out of print, and in 2014 WorldCat listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, &quot;The Dark Forest&quot;, &quot;The Secret City&quot;, &quot;Jeremy&quot;, and &quot;The Cathedral&quot;. In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, &quot;The Walpole Chronicle&quot;, presented by Eric Robson. In 2013 a new stage version of &quot;Rogue Herries&quot; was presented by the Theatre by the Lake company in Walpole&#x27;s adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works.

=== Biographies ===
Two full-length studies of Walpole were published after his death. The first, in 1952, was written by Rupert Hart-Davis, who had known Walpole personally. It was regarded at the time as &quot;among the half dozen best biographies of the century&quot; and has been reissued several times since its first publication. Writing when homosexual acts between men were still outlawed in England, Hart-Davis avoided direct mention of his subject&#x27;s sexuality, so respecting Walpole&#x27;s habitual discretion and the wishes of his brother and sister. He left readers to read between the lines if they wished, in, for example, references to Turkish baths &quot;providing informal opportunities of meeting interesting strangers&quot;. Hart-Davis dedicated the book to &quot;Dorothy, Robin and Harold&quot;, Walpole&#x27;s sister, brother, and long-term companion.

In 1972 Elizabeth Steele&#x27;s study of Walpole was published. Much shorter than Hart-Davis&#x27;s biography, at 178 pages to his 503, it dealt mainly with the novels, and aimed &quot;to show the sources of Hugh Walpole&#x27;s success as a writer during the thirty-five years and fifty books of his busy career&quot;. Steele concentrated on half a dozen of Walpole&#x27;s best books, each illustrating aspects of his writing, under the headings &quot;Acolyte&quot;, &quot;Artist&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Evangelist&quot;, &quot;Critic&quot; and &quot;Romanticist&quot;. Steele also wrote a study of Walpole&#x27;s North American lecture tours (2006) and the article on Walpole in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (2004), which treats his private life briefly but candidly.

<text>Wycomb is a small hamlet in the district of Melton, which is approximately northeast of Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, and is part of the civil parish of Scalford, which also includes the neighbouring village of Chadwell. Until 1 April 1936 it was in the parish of Wycomb and Chadwell.

The settlement name (originally recorded as Wykeham) means &#x27;wīc-hām (Old English) A settlement associated with a Roman &#x27;vicus&#x27;. Wycomb is half a mile west of Chadwell, and Wycomb has traditionally used Chadwell&#x27;s church. The Church of St Mary is a Grade II* Listed building.

==History==
Mentioned in the Domesday Book Survey of 1086, Wycomb was a settlement in the Hundred of Framland, Leicestershire. It had an estimated population of 23 households in 1086. Not long after the Inclosure Act 1773, it was recorded that the 750 acres of land in and around &quot;Caudwell and Wykeham&quot; belonged to the &quot;Parish of Rodeley&quot;. Among the parish landowners, influential figures included the lord of the manor, Thomas Babington, esq., the Bishop of Ely and the Brethren of Wigston&#x27;s Hospital. In 1795, the two settlements, and their surrounding 750 acres of farmland, were considered to be part of East-Goscote Hundred, making it an outlier within the surrounding Hundred of Framland. By 1879, the Waltham branch of the Great Northern Railway ran between the two settlements, adding a railway station on the eastern road out towards Chadwell. Listed buildings in Wycomb include: The Homestead – an 18th century Ironstone built cottage, and Stowleigh – a former farmhouse built in 1850. Both buildings are Grade II Listed.

==Geography==
Wycomb is situated on two Middle Jurassic bedrock geology Formations. Most of the settlement is on Marlstone Rock (Iron-grainstone, 174-191 million years old), and as you go down the valley towards the northeast, it gives way to Dyrham Formation (grey siltstone, 183-191 million years old) with bands of Sandrock. Colluvial and alluvial river deposits overlie the bedrock along ancient watercourses, as you head towards the stream.

<text>Pierre Molinier (April 13, 1900 – March 3, 1976) was a French painter, photographer and &quot;maker of objects&quot;.

== Biography and works ==
Born in Agen, France, he lived his life in Bordeaux. He began his career as a painter of landscapes until his work soon turned towards a fetishistic eroticism photography.

Molinier began to take photographs at the age of 18.

After returning from military service during 1921–1922, Molinier set out for Paris to draw from master works. Prior to Paris, he had apprenticed with his father and Pierre Augustin de Fumadelles, a sculptor. In Paris, Molinier reportedly preferred not to see too much art by the great masters as a personal manifesto on &quot;how to create a work of art.&quot;

Moliner married Andrea Lafaye on July 7, 1931, in Bordeaux.

Molinier began a correspondence with André Breton and sent him photographs of his paintings, and was later integrated into the Surrealist group.

In 1955 Molinier made contact with the leading surrealist Andre Breton and by 1959 was showing at the International Surrealist Exhibition. At this time they defined the purpose of his art as &#x27;for my own stimulation&#x27;, indicating they future direction in one of their exhibits in the 1965 Surrealist show – a dildo.

Between 1965 and his suicide in 1976, he chronicled his exploration of his subconscious transsexual desires in &quot;Cent Photographies Erotiques&quot;: graphically detailed images of pain and pleasure. Molinier, with the aid of a remote control switch, also began to create photographs in which he assumed the roles of dominatrix and succuba previously taken by the women of his paintings. In these black and white photographs, Molinier, either alone with doll-like mannequins or with female models, appears as a transvestite, transformed by his &#x27;fetish&#x27; wardrobe of fishnet stockings, suspender belt, stilettos, mask and corset. In montages, an unlikely number of stockinged limbs intertwine to create the women of Molinier&#x27;s paintings.

He declared that all his erotic works had been painted for his own stimulation: “In painting, I was able to satisfy my leg and nipple fetishism.” His primary interest regarding his sexuality was neither the female body or the male body; Molinier said that legs of either sex arouse him equally, as long as they are hairless and dressed up in black stockings. Regarding his dolls, he said:
“While a doll can function as a substitute for a woman, there is no movement, no life. This has a certain charm if one is before a beautiful corpse. The doll can, but does not have to become the substitute for a woman”

For the last 11 years of his life Molinier played out his own most profound moments in the &#x27;theatre&#x27; of his Bordeaux &#x27;boudoir – atelier&#x27;. He intended his photographs to shock, inviting the viewer to bring to the images his or her own response of excitement or disgust.

In the 1970s, Molinier&#x27;s health began to decline. Like his father before them, Molinier committed suicide at 76 years of age with a gun in his mouth or by hanging himself in a hotel room, leaving a note saying &quot;I’m taking my life. The key is at the concierge&#x27;s&quot;

The epitaph reads &quot;Here lies Pierre Molinier, He was a man without morals.&quot;

== Influences ==
Molinier became interested in such topics after World War I when he entered a masonic order called the Brotherhood. During this time he became fascinated with ancient Egyptian and Indian religions, as well as Satanism.

Molinier explored connections between religious ritual and sexuality which he believed had been obscured by the post-Renaissance morality he so despised. He was a transvestite Baudelaire who rather than words, chose as his medium the corset, the mask and the chain. He challenges received orthodoxies of art and morality and, like a jester, seeks to destroy taboos.

Molinier echoes the ancient Shamanic tradition and experiments in sexual transformation can be interpreted as an attempt to regain the primordial, Platonic perfection of the androgyne. It is significant that his (unrealised) biography was to have been entitled The Shaman and His Creatures.

<text>The creative industries refers to a range of economic activities which are concerned with the generation or exploitation of knowledge and information. They may variously also be referred to as the cultural industries (especially in Europe) or the creative economy, and most recently they have been denominated as the Orange Economy in Latin America and the Caribbean.

John Howkins&#x27; creative economy comprises advertising, architecture, art, crafts, design, fashion, film, music, performing arts, publishing, R&amp;D, software, toys and games, TV and radio, and video games. Some scholars consider that the education industry, including public and private services, are forming a part of the creative industries. There remain, therefore, different definitions of the sector. Last few years delegation from UNESCO want add to Protection of cultural heritage in register .

The creative industries have been seen to become increasingly important to economic well-being, proponents suggesting that &quot;human creativity is the ultimate economic resource&quot;, and that &quot;the industries of the twenty-first century will depend increasingly on the generation of knowledge through creativity and innovation&quot;.

==Definitions==
Various commentators have provided varying suggestions on what activities to include in the concept of &quot;creative industries&quot;, and the name itself has become a contested issue – with significant differences and overlap between the terms &quot;creative industries&quot;, &quot;cultural industries&quot; and &quot;creative economy&quot; l.

Lash and Urry suggest that each of the creative industries has an &quot;irreducible core&quot; concerned with &quot;the exchange of finance for rights in intellectual property&quot;. This echoes the UK Government Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) definition which describes the creative industries as:

:&quot;those industries which have their origin in individual creativity, skill and talent and which have a potential for wealth and job creation through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property&quot;

 the DCMS definition recognizes nine &quot;creative sectors&quot;, namely:

* Advertising and marketing
* Architecture
* Crafts
* Design: product, graphic and fashion design
* Film, TV productions, TV, video, radio and photography
* IT, software and computer services
* Publishing
* Museums, galleries and libraries
* Music, performing and visual arts

To this list Howkins would add toys and games, also including the much broader area of research and development in science and technology. It has also been argued that gastronomy belongs in such a list.

The various fields of engineering do not appear on this list, that emerged from the DCMS reports. This was due, probably, to the fact that engineers occupy relevant positions in &quot;non-cultural&quot; corporations, performing activities of project, management, operation, maintenance, risk analysis and supervision, among others. However, historically and presently, several tasks of engineers can be regarded as highly creative, inventive and innovative. The contribution of engineering is represented by new products, processes and services.

Hesmondhalgh reduces the list to what he terms &quot;the core cultural industries&quot; of advertising and marketing, broadcasting, film, internet and music industries, print and electronic publishing, and video and computer games. His definition only includes those industries that create &quot;texts&quot;&#x27; or &quot;cultural artefacts&quot; and which engage in some form of industrial reproduction.

The DCMS list has proven influential, and many other nations have formally adopted it. It has also been criticised. It has been argued that the division into sectors obscures a divide between lifestyle business, non-profits, and larger businesses, and between those who receive state subsidies (e.g., film) and those who do not (e.g., computer games). The inclusion of the antiques trade often comes into question, since it does not generally involve production (except of reproductions and fakes). The inclusion of all computer services has also been questioned.

Some areas, such as Hong Kong, have preferred to shape their policy around a tighter focus on copyright ownership in the value chain. They adopt the WIPO&#x27;s classifications, which divide up the creative industries according to who owns the copyrights at various stages during the production and distribution of creative content.

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has denominated them for Latin America and the Caribbean as the Orange Economy which is defined as the &quot;group of linked activities through which ideas are transformed into cultural goods and services whose value is determined by intellectual property.&quot;

Others have suggested a distinction between those industries that are open to mass production and distribution (film and video; videogames; broadcasting; publishing), and those that are primarily craft-based and are meant to be consumed in a particular place and moment (visual arts; performing arts; cultural heritage).

==How creative workers are counted==
The DCMS classifies enterprises and occupations as creative according to what the enterprise primarily produces, and what the worker primarily does. Thus, a company which produces records would be classified as belonging to the music industrial sector, and a worker who plays piano would be classified as a musician.

The primary purpose of this is to quantify – for example it can be used to count the number of firms, and the number of workers, creatively employed in any given location, and hence to identify places with particularly high concentrations of creative activities.

It leads to some complications which are not immediately obvious. For example, a security guard working for a music company would be classified as a creative employee, although not as creatively occupied.

The total number of creative employees is then calculated as the sum of:

* All workers employed in creative industries, whether or not creatively occupied (e.g. all musicians, security guards, cleaners, accountants, managers, etc. working for a record company)
* All workers that are creatively occupied, and are not employed in creative industries (for example, a piano teacher in a school). This includes people whose second job is creative, for example somebody who does weekend gigs, writes books, or produces artwork in their spare time

==Properties or characteristics==
According to Richard E. Caves, creative industries are characterized by seven economic properties:

#&quot;Nobody knows principle&quot;: Demand uncertainty exists because the consumers&#x27; reaction to a product are neither known beforehand, nor easily understood afterward.
#&quot;Art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;: Workers care about originality, technical professional skill, harmony, etc. of creative goods and are willing to settle for lower wages than offered by &#x27;humdrum&#x27; jobs.
#&quot;Motley crew principle&quot;: For relatively complex creative products (e.g., films), the production requires diversely skilled inputs. Each skilled input must be present and perform at some minimum level to produce a valuable outcome.
#&quot;Infinite variety&quot;: Products are differentiated by quality and uniqueness; each product is a distinct combination of inputs leading to infinite variety options (e.g., works of creative writing, whether poetry, novel, screenplays or otherwise).
#&quot;A list/B list&quot;: Skills are vertically differentiated. Artists are ranked on their skills, originality, and proficiency in creative processes and/or products. Small differences in skills and talent may yield huge differences in (financial) success.
#&quot;Time flies&quot;: When coordinating complex projects with diversely skilled inputs, time is of the essence.
#&quot;Ars longa&quot;: Some creative products have durability aspects that invoke copyright protection, allowing a creator or performer to collect rents.

The properties described by Caves have been criticized for being too rigid (Towse, 2000). Not all creative workers are purely driven by &#x27;art for art&#x27;s sake&#x27;. The &#x27;ars longa&#x27; property also holds for certain noncreative products (i.e., licensed products). The &#x27;time flies&#x27; property also holds for large construction projects. Creative industries are therefore not unique, but they score generally higher on these properties relative to non-creative industries.

==Difference from the &#x27;cultural industries&#x27;==
There is often a question about the boundaries between creative industries and the similar term of cultural industries. Cultural industries are best described as an adjunct-sector of the creative industries. Cultural industries include industries that focus on cultural tourism and heritage, museums and libraries, sports and outdoor activities, and a variety of &#x27;way of life&#x27; activities that arguably range from local pet shows to a host of hobbyist concerns. Thus cultural industries are more concerned about delivering other kinds of value—including cultural wealth and social wealth—rather than primarily providing monetary value. (See also cultural institutions studies.)

==The creative class==
Some authors, such as the American urban studies theorist Richard Florida, argue for a wider focus on the products of knowledge workers, and judge the &#x27;creative class&#x27; (his own term) to include nearly all those offering professional knowledge-based services.

===The creative class and diversity===
Florida&#x27;s focus leads him to pay particular attention to the nature of the creative workforce. In a study of why particular US cities such as San Francisco seem to attract creative producers, Florida argues that a high proportion of workers from the &#x27;creative class&#x27; provide a key input to creative production, which enterprises seek out. He seeks to quantitatively establish the importance of diversity and multiculturalism in the cities concerned, for example the existence of a significant public gay community, ethnic and religious variety, and tolerance.

==Economic contribution==
Globally, Creative Industries excluding software and general scientific research and development are said to have accounted for around 4% of the world&#x27;s economic output in 1999, which is the last year for which comprehensive collated figures are currently available. Estimates of the output corresponding to scientific Research and Development suggest that an additional 4-9% might be attributable to the sector if its definition is extended to include such activities, though the figures vary significantly between different countries.

In 2015, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) assisted in the preparation of national studies that measured the size of over 50 copyright industries around the world. Findings from the recompilation of these studies indicate that the GDP contribution to national economies vary between 2% and 11%.

Taking the UK as an example, in the context of other sectors, the creative industries make a far more significant contribution to output than hospitality or utilities and deliver four times the output due to agriculture, fisheries and forestry. In terms of employment and depending on the definition of activities included, the sector is a major employer of between 4-6% of the UK&#x27;s working population, though this is still significantly less than employment due to traditional areas of work such as retail and manufacturing.

Within the creative industries sector, and again taking the UK as an example, the three largest sub-sectors are design, publishing, and television and radio. Together these account for around 75% of revenues and 50% of employment.

In economies like Brazil, for example, a 2021 study into the Intellectual Property intensive sectors in the Brazilian economy found that 450 of Brazil&#x27;s 673 economic classes could be classified as IP-intensive sectors which collectively employed 19,3 million people. The Brazilian creative industry&#x27;s collective share of GDP between 2014 and 2016, when calculated across these 450 economic classes, totaled R$2,1 trillion Reais or 44,2% of Brazil&#x27;s GDP.

The complex supply chains in the creative industries sometimes make it challenging to calculate accurate figures for the gross value added by each sub-sector. This is particularly the case for the service-focused sub-sectors such as advertising, whereas it is more straightforward in product-focused sub-sectors such as crafts.

There may be a tendency for publicly funded creative industries development services to inaccurately estimate the number of creative businesses during the mapping process. There is also imprecision in nearly all tax code systems that determine a person&#x27;s profession, since many creative people operate simultaneously in multiple roles and jobs. Both these factors mean that official statistics relating to the Creative Industries should be treated with caution.

The creative industries in Europe make a significant contribution to the EU economy, creating about 3% of EU GDP – corresponding to an annual market value of billion – and employing about 6 million people. In addition, the sector plays a crucial role in fostering innovation, in particular for devices and networks. The EU records the second highest TV viewing figures globally, producing more films than any other region in the world. In that respect, the newly proposed &#x27;Creative Europe&#x27; programme (July 2011) will help preserve cultural heritage while increasing the circulation of creative works inside and outside the EU. The programme will play a consequential role in stimulating cross border co-operation, promoting peer learning and making these sectors more professional. The Commission will then propose a financial instrument run by the European Investment Bank to provide debt and equity finance for cultural and creative industries. The role of the non-state actors within the governance regarding Medias will not be neglected anymore. Therefore, building a new approach extolling the crucial importance of a European level playing field industry may boost the adoption of policies aimed at developing a conducive environment, enabling European companies as well as citizens to use their imagination and creativity – both sources of innovation -, and therefore of competitiveness and sustainability. It supposes to tailor the regulatory and institutional frameworks in supporting private-public collaboration, in particular in the Medias sector. The EU therefore plans to develop clusters, financing instruments as well as foresight activities to support this sector. The European Commission wishes to assist European creators and audiovisual enterprises to develop new markets through the use of digital technology, and asks how policy-making can best help achieve this. A more entrepreneurial culture will have to take hold with a more positive attitude towards risk-taking, and a capacity to innovate anticipating future trends. Creativity plays an important role in human resource management as artists and creative professionals can think laterally. Moreover, new jobs requiring new skills created in the post-crisis economy should be supported by labour mobility to ensure that people are employed wherever their skills are needed.

===In the US===
In the introduction to a 2013 special issue of &quot;Work and Occupations&quot; on artists in the US workforce, the guest editors argue that by examining the work lives of artists, one can identify characteristics and actions that help both individual workers and policy makers adapt to changing economic conditions. Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper cite multiple sources to suggest artists&#x27; skill sets allow them to &quot;work beyond existing markets and create entirely new opportunities for themselves and others&quot;. Specifically, Lingo and Tepper suggest artistic workers are &quot;catalysts of change and innovation&quot; because they &quot;face special challenges managing ambiguity, developing and sustaining a relative identity, and forming community in the context of an individually based enterprise economy&quot; (2013). Because of these adaptive skills, the suggestion is that &quot;studying how artists cope with uncertainty and the factors that influence their success should be relevant for understanding these broader social and economic trends facing today&#x27;s (and tomorrow&#x27;s) workforce.&quot;

This view of artist-as-change-agent changes the questions researchers ask of creative economies. Old research questions would focus on topics like &quot;skills, work practices, contracts, wage differentials, employment incentives, formal credentials, employment pipelines, and labor flows of differentiated occupational categories&quot;. Examples of new questions include:
# How do artists both create changes in the labor market itself and the way cultural work is done?
# What is their process of innovation and enterprise?
# What is the nature of their work and the resources they draw upon?
# How do different network structures produce different opportunity spaces?
# How do artistic workers create and manage planned serendipity—the spaces and exchanges that produce unexpected collaborations and opportunities? 
# How do creative workers broker and synthesize across occupational, genre, geographic, and industry boundaries to create new possibilities? (Tepper &amp; Lingo, 2013)

==Wider role==
As some first world countries struggle to compete in traditional markets such as manufacturing, many now see the creative industry as a key component in a new knowledge economy, capable perhaps of delivering urban regeneration, often through initiatives linked to exploitation of cultural heritage that leads to increased tourism. It is often argued that, in future, the ideas and imagination of countries like the United Kingdom will be their greatest asset; in support of this argument, a number of universities in the UK have started to offer creative entrepreneurship as a specific area for study and research. Indeed, UK government figures reveal that the UK&#x27;s creative industries account for over a million jobs and brought in billion to the UK economy (DCMS &quot;Creative Industries Mapping Document&quot; 2001), although the data sets underlying these figures are open to question.

In recent years, creative industries have become &#x27;increasingly attractive to governments outside the developed world&#x27;. In 2005, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) XI High Level Panel on Creative Industries and Development commissioned several studies to identify challenges and opportunities facing the growth and development of creative industries in developing industries. As Cunningham &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) put it, &#x27;the harnessing of creativity brings with it the potential of new wealth creation, the cultivation of local talent and the generation of creative capital, the development of new export markets, significant multiplier effects throughout the broader economy, the utilisation of information communication technologies and enhanced competitiveness in an increasingly global economy&#x27;. A key driver of interest in creative industries and development is the acknowledgement that the value of creative production resides in ideas and individual creativity, and developing countries have rich cultural traditions and pools of creative talent which lay a basic foundation for creative enterprises. Reflecting the growing interest in the potential of creative industries in developing countries, in October 2011 a Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy was created within the Indonesian government with well-known economist Mari Pangestu appointed as the first minister to hold the position.

<text>In mathematics, bilinear interpolation is a method for interpolating functions of two variables (e.g., &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;) using repeated linear interpolation. It is usually applied to functions sampled on a 2D rectilinear grid, though it can be generalized to functions defined on the vertices of (a mesh of) arbitrary convex quadrilaterals.

Bilinear interpolation is performed using linear interpolation first in one direction, and then again in another direction. Although each step is linear in the sampled values and in the position, the interpolation as a whole is not linear but rather quadratic in the sample location.

Bilinear interpolation is one of the basic resampling techniques in computer vision and image processing, where it is also called bilinear filtering or bilinear texture mapping.

==Computation==
Suppose that we want to find the value of the unknown function &quot;f&quot; at the point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;). It is assumed that we know the value of &quot;f&quot; at the four points &quot;Q&quot;11 = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;1), &quot;Q&quot;12 = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2), &quot;Q&quot;21 = (&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;1), and &quot;Q&quot;22 = (&quot;x&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;2).

===Repeated linear interpolation ===
We first do linear interpolation in the &quot;x&quot;-direction. This yields
:formula_1

We proceed by interpolating in the &quot;y&quot;-direction to obtain the desired estimate:
:formula_2

Note that we will arrive at the same result if the interpolation is done first along the &quot;y&quot; direction and then along the &quot;x&quot; direction.

===Polynomial fit===
An alternative way is to write the solution to the interpolation problem as a multilinear polynomial

:formula_3
where the coefficients are found by solving the linear system

:formula_4

yielding the result
:formula_5

=== Weighted mean ===

The solution can also be written as a weighted mean of the &quot;f&quot;(&quot;Q&quot;):
:formula_6

where the weights sum to 1 and satisfy the transposed linear system
:formula_7

yielding the result
:formula_8
which simplifies to
:formula_9
in agreement with the result obtained by repeated linear interpolation. The set of weights can also be interpreted as a set of generalized barycentric coordinates for a rectangle.

=== Alternative matrix form ===
Combining the above, we have
:formula_10

=== On the unit square ===
If we choose a coordinate system in which the four points where &quot;f&quot; is known are (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1), then the interpolation formula simplifies to 
:formula_11

or equivalently, in matrix operations:
:formula_12

Here we also recognize the weights:
:formula_13
Alternatively, the interpolant on the unit square can be written as
:formula_14

where 
:formula_15

In both cases, the number of constants (four) correspond to the number of data points where &quot;f&quot; is given.

== Properties ==

As the name suggests, the bilinear interpolant is &quot;not&quot; linear; but it is linear (i.e. affine) along lines parallel to either the &quot;x&quot; or the &quot;y&quot; direction, equivalently if &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot; is held constant. Along any other straight line, the interpolant is quadratic. Even though the interpolation is &quot;not&quot; linear in the position (&quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;), at a fixed point it &quot;is&quot; linear in the interpolation values, as can be seen in the (matrix) equations above.

The result of bilinear interpolation is independent of which axis is interpolated first and which second. If we had first performed the linear interpolation in the &quot;y&quot; direction and then in the &quot;x&quot; direction, the resulting approximation would be the same.

The interpolant is a bilinear polynomial, which is also a harmonic function satisfying Laplace&#x27;s equation. Its graph is a bilinear Bézier surface patch.

== Inverse and generalization ==
In general, the interpolant will assume any value (in the convex hull of the vertex values) at an infinite number of points (forming branches of hyperbolas), so the interpolation is not invertible.

However, when bilinear interpolation is applied to two functions simultaneously, such as when interpolating a vector field, then the interpolation is invertible (under certain conditions). In particular, this inverse can be used to find the &quot;unit square coordinates&quot; of a point inside any convex quadrilateral (by considering the coordinates of the quadrilateral as a vector field which is bilinearly interpolated on the unit square). Using this procedure bilinear interpolation can be extended to any convex quadrilateral, though the computation is significantly more complicated if it is not a parallelogram. The resulting map between quadrilaterals is known as a &quot;bilinear transformation&quot;, &quot;bilinear warp&quot; or &quot;bilinear distortion&quot;.

Alternatively, a projective mapping between a quadrilateral and the unit square may be used, but the resulting interpolant will not be bilinear.

In the special case when the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, a linear mapping to the unit square exists and the generalization follows easily.

The obvious extension of bilinear interpolation to three dimensions is called trilinear interpolation.

Let formula_16 be a vector field that is bilinearly interpolated on the unit square parameterized by formula_17. Inverting the interpolation requires solving a system of two bilinear polynomial equations:formula_18where formula_19Taking a 2-d cross product (see Grassman product) of the system with a carefully chosen vectors allows us to eliminate terms:formula_20which expands toformula_21whereformula_22The quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. We have the equivalent determinants formula_23and the solutionsformula_24(opposite signs are enforced by the linear relation). The cases when formula_25 or formula_26 must be handled separately. Given the right conditions, one of the two solutions should be in the unit square.

== Application in image processing ==
In computer vision and image processing, bilinear interpolation is used to resample images and textures. An algorithm is used to map a screen pixel location to a corresponding point on the texture map. A weighted average of the attributes (color, transparency, etc.) of the four surrounding texels is computed and applied to the screen pixel. This process is repeated for each pixel forming the object being textured.

When an image needs to be scaled up, each pixel of the original image needs to be moved in a certain direction based on the scale constant. However, when scaling up an image by a non-integral scale factor, there are pixels (i.e., &quot;holes&quot;) that are not assigned appropriate pixel values. In this case, those &quot;holes&quot; should be assigned appropriate RGB or grayscale values so that the output image does not have non-valued pixels.

Bilinear interpolation can be used where perfect image transformation with pixel matching is impossible, so that one can calculate and assign appropriate intensity values to pixels. Unlike other interpolation techniques such as nearest-neighbor interpolation and bicubic interpolation, bilinear interpolation uses values of only the 4 nearest pixels, located in diagonal directions from a given pixel, in order to find the appropriate color intensity values of that pixel.

Bilinear interpolation considers the closest 2 × 2 neighborhood of known pixel values surrounding the unknown pixel&#x27;s computed location. It then takes a weighted average of these 4 pixels to arrive at its final, interpolated value.

=== Example ===
As seen in the example on the right, the intensity value at the pixel computed to be at row 20.2, column 14.5 can be calculated by first linearly interpolating between the values at column 14 and 15 on each rows 20 and 21, giving
:formula_27

and then interpolating linearly between these values, giving
:formula_28

This algorithm reduces some of the visual distortion caused by resizing an image to a non-integral zoom factor, as opposed to nearest-neighbor interpolation, which will make some pixels appear larger than others in the resized image.

== A simplification of terms ==

This example is of tabularised pressure (columns) vs temperature (rows) data as a lookup against some variable:

:formula_29

The following standard calculation by parts has 27 operations:
:formula_30
The above has several repeated operations, e.g., formula_31, formula_32, formula_32, formula_34, as well as some ratios. These repetitions can be assigned temporary variables whilst computing a single interpolation, which will reduce the number of operations to 19.

This can all be simplified from the initial 19 individual operations to 17 individual operations as such:
:formula_35

Simplification of terms is good practice for application of mathematical methodology to engineering applications and can reduce computational and energy requirements for a process.{{cn|date=December 2024}}

<doc id="674486" wikidata="Q745928" url="?curid=674486" title="Eureka, Nunavut">
<text>Eureka is a small research base on Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island, Qikiqtaaluk Region, in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. It is located on the north side of Slidre Fiord, which enters Eureka Sound farther west. It is the third-northernmost permanent research community in the world. The only two farther north are Alert, which is also on Ellesmere Island, and Nord, in Greenland. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and the lowest amount of precipitation of any weather station in Canada.

Eureka&#x27;s postal code is X0A 0G0 and the area code is 867.

==Divisions==
The base consists of three areas:

*the Eureka Aerodrome which includes &quot;Fort Eureka&quot; (the quarters for military personnel maintaining the island&#x27;s communications equipment)
*the Environment and Climate Change Canada Weather Station
*the Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory (PEARL), formerly the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Observatory (AStrO)

PEARL is operated by a consortium of Canadian university researchers and government agencies known as the Canadian Network for Detection of Atmospheric Change. PEARL announced it would cease full-time year-round operation as of April 30, 2012, due to lack of funding, but this decision was reversed in May 2013 with the announcement of new funds.

==History==
Eureka was founded on April 7, 1947, as part of an initiative to set up a network of Arctic weather stations. On this date, of supplies were airlifted to a promising spot on Ellesmere Island, and five prefabricated Jamesway huts were constructed. Regular weather observations began on January 1, 1948. The station has expanded over the years. At its peak, in the 1970s, at least fifteen staff were on site; in 2005, it reported a permanent population of zero with at least eight staff on a continuous rotational basis.

Several generations of buildings have been developed. The latest operations centre, with work areas and staff quarters in one large structure, was completed in 2005.

==Location and accessibility==

The complex is powered by diesel generators. The station is supplied once every six weeks with fresh food and mail by air, and annually in the late summer, a supply ship from Montreal brings heavy supplies. On July 3, 2009, a Danish Challenger 604 MMA jet landed at Eureka&#x27;s aerodrome.
The jet is a military observation aircraft based on the Challenger executive jet. This jet visited Eureka on a familiarization trip, in order to prepare for the possibility of Danish aircraft assisting in search and rescue missions over Canadian territory. The Canadian American Strategic Review noted critically that the first jet to fly a mission to Eureka was not Canadian.

At Eureka&#x27;s latitude, a geosynchronous communications satellite, if due south, would require an antenna to be pointed nearly horizontally; satellites farther east or west along that orbit would be below the horizon. Telephone access and television broadcasts arrived in 1982 when Operation Hurricane resulted in the establishment of a satellite receiving station at nearby Skull Point, which has an open view to the south. The low-power Channel 9 TV transmitter at Skull Point was the world&#x27;s most northern TV station at the time. In the 1980s, TV audio was often connected to the telephone to feed CBC-TV news to CHAR-FM in isolated CFS Alert. More recently, CANDAC has installed what is likely the world&#x27;s most northerly geosynchronous satellite ground-station to provide Internet-based communications to PEARL.

Other inhabited places on Ellesmere Island include Alert and Grise Fiord.

==Flora and fauna==
Eureka has been described as &quot;The Garden Spot of the Arctic&quot; due to the flora and fauna abundant around the Eureka area, more so than anywhere else in the High Arctic. Fauna include polar bears, muskox, Arctic wolves, Arctic foxes, Arctic hares, and lemmings. In addition, summer nesting geese, ducks, owls, loons, ravens, gulls and many other smaller birds nest, raise their young, and return south in August.

==Climate==
Eureka experiences a polar climate (&quot;ET&quot;). The settlement sees the midnight sun between April 10 and August 29, with no sunlight at all between mid-October and late February. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada with an annual mean temperature of . Average winter temperatures are almost comparable to those found in northeastern Siberia. However, summers are slightly warmer than other places in the Canadian Arctic because Eureka is somewhat landlocked, being near the centre of Ellesmere Island. Even so, since record keeping began, the temperature has never exceeded , first reached on July 14, 2009. Although a polar desert, evaporation is also very low, which allows the limited moisture to be made available for plants and wildlife. Its frost-free season averages 56 days, much longer than many other places nearby.

<doc id="674489" wikidata="Q1227672" url="?curid=674489" title="No-till farming">
<text>No-till farming (also known as zero tillage or direct drilling) is an agricultural technique for growing crops or pasture without disturbing the soil through tillage. No-till farming decreases the amount of soil erosion tillage causes in certain soils, especially in sandy and dry soils on sloping terrain. Other possible benefits include an increase in the amount of water that infiltrates the soil, soil retention of organic matter, and nutrient cycling. These methods may increase the amount and variety of life in and on the soil. While conventional no-tillage systems use herbicides to control weeds, organic systems use a combination of strategies, such as planting cover crops as mulch to suppress weeds.

There are three basic methods of no-till farming. &quot;Sod seeding&quot; is when crops are sown with seeding machinery into a sod produced by applying herbicides on a cover crop (killing that vegetation). &quot;Direct seeding&quot; is when crops are sown through the residue of previous crop. &quot;Surface seeding&quot; or &quot;direct seeding&quot; is when seeds are left on the surface of the soil; on flatlands, this requires no machinery and minimal labor.

While no-till is agronomically advantageous and results in higher yields, farmers wishing to adapt the system face a number of challenges. Established farms may have to face a learning curve, buy new equipment, and deal with new field conditions. Perhaps the biggest impediment, especially for grains, is that farmers can no longer rely on the mechanical pest and weed control that occurs when crop residue is buried to significant depths. No-till farmers must rely on chemicals, biological pest control, cover cropping, and more intensive management of fields.

Tillage is dominant in agriculture today, but no-till methods may have success in some contexts. In some cases minimum tillage or &quot;low-till&quot; methods combine till and no-till methods. For example, some approaches may use shallow cultivation (i.e. using a disc harrow) but no plowing or use strip tillage.

==Background==
Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation, typically removing weeds established in the previous season. Tilling can create a flat seed bed or one that has formed areas, such as rows or raised beds, to enhance the growth of desired plants. It is an ancient technique with clear evidence of its use since at least 3000 B.C.

No-till farming is not equivalent to conservation tillage or strip tillage. Conservation tillage is a group of practices that reduce the amount of tillage needed. No-till and strip tillage are both forms of conservation tillage. No-till is the practice of never tilling a field. Tilling every other year is called rotational tillage.

The effects of tillage can include soil compaction; loss of organic matter; degradation of soil aggregates; death or disruption of soil microbes and other organisms including mycorrhizae, arthropods, and earthworms; and soil erosion where topsoil is washed or blown away.

==Origin==
The practice of no-till farming is a combination of different ideas developed over time, many techniques and principles used in no-till farming are a continuation of traditional market gardening found in various regions like France. A formalized opposition to plowing started in the 1940s with Edward H. Faulkner, author of &quot;Plowman&#x27;s Folly&quot;. In that book, however, Faulkner only criticizes the deeper moldboard plow and its action, not surface tillage. It was not until the development after WWII of powerful herbicides such as paraquat that various researchers and farmers started to try out the idea. The first adopters of no-till include Klingman (North Carolina), Edward Faulkner, L. A. Porter (New Zealand), Harry and Lawrence Young (Herndon, Kentucky), and the Instituto de Pesquisas Agropecuarias Meridional (1971 in Brazil) with Herbert Bartz.

==Adoption across the world==
Land under no-till farming has increased across the world. In 1999, about {{convert|45|e6ha|mi2|abbr=unit}} was under no-till farming worldwide, which increased to {{convert|72|e6ha|mi2|abbr=unit}} in 2003 and to {{convert|111|e6ha|mi2|abbr=unit}} in 2009.

===Australia===
Per figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Agricultural Resource Management Survey, in Australia the percentage of agricultural land under No-till farming methods was 26% in 2000–01, which more than doubled to 57% in 2007–08. As at 30 June 2017, of the {{convert|20|e6ha|mi2|abbr=unit}} of crop land cultivated 79% (or 16 million hectares) received no cultivation. Similarly, 70% (or 2 million hectares) of the 3 million hectares of pasture land cultivated received no cultivation, apart from sowing.

===South America===
South America had the highest adoption of No-till farming in the world, which in 2014 constituted 47% of the total global area under no-till farming.
The countries with highest adoption are Argentina (80%), Brazil (50%), Paraguay (90%), and Uruguay (82%).

In Argentina the usage of no-till resulted in reduction of soil erosion losses by 80%, cost reductions by more than 50% and increased farm incomes.

In Brazil the usage of no-till resulted in reduction of soil erosion losses by 97%, higher farm productivity and income increase by 57% five years after the starting of no-till farming.

In Paraguay, net farm incomes increased by 77% after adoption of no-till farming.

===United States===
No-till farming is a soil conservation practice used in the United States, with adoption increasing due to its potential to reduce costs and improve soil health. By minimizing soil disturbance, no-till farming reduces the number of passes required with machinery, leading to lower fuel and labor expenses. Additionally, the retention of crop residue helps reduce evaporation, enhances water infiltration, and improves moisture retention in the soil.

<doc id="674490" wikidata="Q2531270" url="?curid=674490" title="Earl Hebner">
<text>Earl William Hebner (born May 17, 1949) is an American retired professional wrestling referee. He is best known for his time as senior referee for the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) from 1988 to 2005. Hebner (along with his identical twin brother, Dave) played a prominent role in the inaugural &quot;The Main Event&quot; card in 1988, in which André the Giant controversially defeated Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, as well as the infamous &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot; during the main event of the 1997 Survivor Series. He also participated in a number of storylines, including feuds involving The McMahon–Helmsley Faction and The Alliance. Hebner was also the senior referee for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) from 2005 to 2017, and was inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2015.

In 2019, Earl Hebner joined All Elite Wrestling, where he was used primarily for main event and title matches.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1977–1988)===
Hebner officiated matches for Jim Crockett Promotions during much of the 1980s. He was the referee during the famous &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Starrcade 1985 between Tully Blanchard and Magnum T. A. He can be seen at ringside during the first ever WarGames match at the 1987 Great American Bash as well as the final match of the Bunkhouse Stampede tournament in January 1988.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1988–2005)===
====Debut and championship controversy (1988–1997)====
Just days after that match, Hebner debuted in the World Wrestling Federation as a referee during a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match pitting champion Hulk Hogan against challenger André the Giant, which aired live on February 5, 1988, on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Main Event&quot;. In the storyline, Hebner&#x27;s identical twin brother Dave Hebner was the assigned official, but unbeknownst to Hogan, André&#x27;s manager Ted DiBiase had bribed the then-unknown Earl Hebner to steal the victory and the championship (Earl and Dave are identical twins, so this was easy to pull off). Earl then counted André&#x27;s pin against Hogan, even though Hogan&#x27;s shoulders were clearly off the mat. As André and DiBiase were celebrating (with André quickly &quot;selling&quot; his title to an overjoyed DiBiase), Dave (whom DiBiase had locked in a closet prior to the match) ran to the ring and confronted Earl. The two brothers argued, and then they fought each other in the middle of the ring. Hulk Hogan, figuring out that Dave&#x27;s &quot;evil twin&quot; had jobbed him out, picked Earl up and gorilla press slammed him over the ropes and onto the aisleway (missing DiBiase). It was part of the storyline for Hogan to lose the title in order for him to start filming on &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;.

This match helped set up a 14-man elimination tournament at WrestleMania IV, since WWF President Jack Tunney declared the title &quot;vacant&quot; a week after &quot;The Main Event&quot; match as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship &quot;cannot be bought or sold,&quot; where the winner would win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Vince McMahon paid both Hebners a bonus of $2,500 for participating in the angle.

Meanwhile, the WWF continued to build heat for Earl Hebner through a kayfabe &quot;investigative report&quot; published in the promotion&#x27;s flagship publication, &quot;WWF Magazine&quot;. The article claimed, through a fictional backstory, that Dave had &quot;been plagued by the misdeeds of his brother Earl&quot; throughout their childhoods, citing such examples as Earl&#x27;s cheating in school and, while posing as Dave, doing such things as bullying fellow students and abandoning Dave&#x27;s pretty girlfriend on a sidewalk in a slum district at night. The report continued by noting that, despite Dave&#x27;s appeal of the controversial ending to the Hogan-Andre match at &quot;The Main Event&quot;, Tunney had to uphold the decision since Earl was a licensed referee in Indiana (the match took place in Indianapolis); and that, as a result of Earl&#x27;s cooperation, he became a &quot;very rich&quot; man thanks to a payoff by DiBiase.

However, the &quot;evil twin&quot; referee storyline was quickly dropped when Dave was apparently injured in the aftermath of the Hogan-Andre &quot;Main Event&quot; match; in a 2001 interview with the &quot;WWF RAW Magazine&quot;, Dave claimed to have suffered broken ribs as a result of Earl kicking him as part of the angle, forcing Dave out of action until after WrestleMania IV. The storyline was then shifted to have Earl come clean, and he was the referee when &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage won the Tournament final at WrestleMania IV against &quot;Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.

====The Montreal Screwjob (1997)====

The most infamous event in Hebner&#x27;s career—and possibly in the history of professional wrestling in North America—came during the main event of the 1997 Survivor Series in what has since been dubbed the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;. During a match for the WWF Championship between then champion Bret Hart and challenger Shawn Michaels, Hebner signaled for the timekeeper to ring the bell (signifying the end of the match) while Michaels had Hart in a Sharpshooter hold—Hart&#x27;s long-established signature move—even though Hart visibly had not submitted. Michaels had thus &quot;won&quot; the WWF Championship. This was not the match ending that Hart had asked for. Hebner had, at the behest of Vince McMahon, &quot;screwed&quot; Hart out of the title. The reason for the &quot;screwjob&quot; was that Hart, who would be leaving the company one month later to join a rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), was unwilling to lose the title to Michaels in Canada. Though Hart said that he was willing to vacate the title the next night on &quot;WWF Raw&quot;, McMahon feared that Hart would leave the company with the title, take the belt to WCW, and disrespect it as Madusa had done in 1995 with the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship, throwing the belt into a garbage can during a live &quot;Nitro&quot; show. He therefore decided to remove the title from Hart forcibly, by instructing Hebner (who had previously promised Hart &quot;on his children&#x27;s lives&quot; that he would not betray him) to signal an end to the bout when Michaels had Hart in a submission hold. The fallout of the screwjob led to a large degree of antagonism towards Hebner, McMahon, and Michaels, especially in Canada, where fans often chant &quot;You screwed Bret!&quot; at the offending parties. In the same vein, Earl&#x27;s son Brian Hebner, a former WWE referee on the SmackDown! brand and current Impact Wrestling referee, received chants of &quot;Your dad screwed Bret!&quot; at shows in Canada. However, on &quot;Right After Wrestling&quot;, hosted by Arda Ocal and Jimmy Korderas, Earl stated that he has since spoken with Bret and they have buried the hatchet, with regards to the Montreal Screwjob.
====Later WWF/E career and departure (1999–2005)====
Hebner was involved in several storylines. He spearheaded the (kayfabe) referee&#x27;s strike in 1999, resulting in referees being given the authority to defend themselves if physically provoked by wrestlers. In early 2000, he cost Triple H his WWF Championship by quick-counting during a match between Triple H and Chris Jericho following weeks of abuse by Triple H. Triple H eventually forced Hebner to reverse the decision, promising never to lay his hands on Hebner as long as Hebner was a WWF employee. After Hebner took the title from Jericho and gave it back to Triple H, Triple H &quot;fired&quot; Hebner and promptly Pedigreed him and beat him unconscious. Hebner was reinstated by Linda McMahon thirteen days later, replacing corrupt guest referee Shane McMahon during a title match between Triple H and The Rock at Backlash and counting the fall when The Rock covered Triple H for the pin. Hebner was also the first referee to be a playable character in a wrestling video game as he was included in the roster of WWF No Mercy. During the Invasion angle in late 2001, Hebner became involved in a feud involving WCW referee Nick Patrick. Patrick was a biased referee who often helped The Alliance achieve victories over their WWF opponents. Hebner defeated Patrick in a match at WWF Invasion.

On July 18, 2005, WWE announced that Hebner was fired from WWE for selling WWE merchandise without permission. Hebner&#x27;s identical twin brother Dave was released from WWE as well on July 19 in connection with these events. These activities would have been conducted from a store that Earl Hebner had partial ownership in, the St. Louis based Pro Shirt Shop. To avoid negative publicity, the controlling owner of the Pro Shirt Shop, Nick Ridenour, bought out Hebner&#x27;s share in the company and released a press statement which claimed that the company only received merchandise from licensed distributors.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling (2006–2017)===

Seven months after his departure from WWE, Hebner debuted for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) at the Against All Odds pay-per-view on February 12, 2006. He officiated the main event, which saw Canadian born Christian Cage defeat Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, commentators Mike Tenay and Don West alluded to the Montréal Screwjob on several occasions, urging Hebner not to call for the bell when Jarrett placed Cage in a sharpshooter. Despite the concerns of the commentators, Hebner was an impartial referee. However, he once again caused controversy based on his actions at the TNA Slammiversary 2006 pay-per-view. During the King of the Mountain match, he assisted Jeff Jarrett in winning the match by pushing a ladder over with Sting and then-champion Christian Cage on it. This led to the new head of management Jim Cornette taking the belt from Jarrett as the show ended, leaving the status of the belt in question as to who would be the champion. On the June 22 episode of &quot;TNA Impact!&quot;, Cornette vacated the title. On the June 30 episode, he awarded the title to Jarrett, but fired (kayfabe) Hebner. Hebner was then reinstated by Cornette due to Jarrett&#x27;s polygraph test saying that Hebner was not involved. Hebner was punched in the face by Jeff Jarrett and was (kayfabe) injured. At No Surrender he replaced original referee Slick Johnson for the TNA Knockout Tag Team Championship match because of what happened at Victory Road.
TNA Wrestling had their own version of the Montreal Screwjob, in this case, it was a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match on the January 21, 2010, episode of TNA Impact! between Kurt Angle and defending champion A.J. Styles. Previously to this match, Angle and Styles had fought at the TNA pay-per-view Genesis, which was also for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship except the stipulation was that if Angle were to lose, he would never get another shot at the title in 2010. In this match, Ric Flair interfered causing Styles to retain his title. Hulk Hogan, now running TNA with Eric Bischoff somewhat controversially to some fans, said that due to Flair&#x27;s interference in the match at Genesis, Angle would get another match at the title on Impact! and if Flair were to interfere, Styles would be stripped of the title and the title would be awarded to Angle. During the match, Angle put his signature move, the Ankle Lock on Styles, but Styles reversed it and used the Ankle Lock on Angle which resulted in the &quot;Screwjob&quot; when referee Earl Hebner called for the bell although Angle did not submit, similar to The Montreal Screwjob. On the January 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Earl confessed to screwing Bret Hart and Kurt Angle for the money. Hulk Hogan then suspended him indefinitely. On the March 8 Monday night edition of &quot;Impact!&quot; Hogan decided to give Hebner a second chance and had him referee the main event of the evening, a tag team match, where Hogan and Abyss faced A.J. Styles and Ric Flair.

In May 2012, Hebner signed a contract extension with TNA, which would keep him with the promotion through 2013. In July 2012, Hebner started a romance storyline with Madison Rayne, as part of which, he started helping her win matches, including one for the TNA Women&#x27;s Knockout Championship on August 12 at Hardcore Justice. In response to this situation, Knockouts Executive Brooke Hogan announced that Hebner would no longer referee the Knockouts matches. On April 17, 2014, Hebner was reinstated as Knockouts referee, when Madison Rayne defeated Velvet Sky in a Street Fight. On June 19, 2014, Hebner was involved in the TNA World Heavyweight Championship bout between Kenny King and Eric Young, but after King&#x27;s loss, MVP fired Hebner and made him get rid of his uniform, to the disgust of his son, Brian, but was reinstated by the new Executive Chief of Wrestling Operations, Kurt Angle after MVP was relieved of his duties by Board of Directors.

On September 14, 2015, it was announced that Hebner would be inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame class of 2015. On November 3, 2017, it was reported both Hebner and his son, Brian, had parted ways with Impact Wrestling.

=== Independent circuit (2018–2019) ===
On July 7, 2018, Hebner refereed what was advertised as his final event at Ring Wars Carolina, which also saw the refereeing debut of his daughter, Katie.

On September 1, 2018, Hebner refereed All In, and was part of the match between Nick Aldis and Cody Rhodes for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

Hebner refereed NWA 70th Anniversary Show in Nashville, Tennessee, and was part of the main event match between Nick Aldis and Cody Rhodes for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

On February 16, 2019, Hebner refereed at All Star Wrestling&#x27;s Justice in the main event between Sharp Dressed Man Lawrence and the debuting Brian Snyder in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Near the end of the match, Snyder put Lawrence in the crossface, Lawrence&#x27;s finishing hold, as Hebner called for the bell, even though Lawrence never gave up. The finish was very similar to the Montreal Screwjob.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019–2021) ===

In 2019, Hebner, along with a number of other referees, joined All Elite Wrestling. He officiated a limited number of AEW events, primarily AEW pay-per-views and selected episodes of &quot;AEW Dynamite&quot;. Hebner then went on a one-year officiating hiatus that ended in 2022 when he returned to Impact Wrestling.

=== Return to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2022–present) ===

Hebner made his return to IMPACT Wrestling after 5 years away from the company at Slammiversary (2022) to count the 1–2–3 to give the Impact Originals the win against Honor No More. He returned again at Slammiversary (2024) in Montreal as a referee in X-Division champion Mustafa Ali&#x27;s pocket, in reference to Hebner&#x27;s role in the Montreal Screwjob, but this time refused to call the match against challenger Mike Bailey while Ali had him locked in the sharpshooter, and ultimately called the match fair when Ali submitted to a sharpshooter from Bailey.

==Personal life==
Hebner was married twice, he was first married to Carol Ann Kettner from 1969 to 1977. He later married Susan Ann Green, the marriage lasted from 1978 to 2000.

Hebner&#x27;s son Brian Hebner is also a professional wrestling referee (retired in June 2022) before becoming a professional wrestling podcaster with Jim Korderas, while his daughter Katie made a cameo appearance with TNA in 2008 as &quot;Katie Kim&quot;, the sister of Gail Kim. Hebner&#x27;s identical twin brother, Dave, was also a wrestling referee as well as a promoter. Dave died on June 17, 2022, from Parkinson&#x27;s Disease.

Hebner played himself in the episode &quot;Sixteen Candles and Four-Hundred Pound Men&quot; of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. Stock footage of one of his WWF matches was also featured in the motion picture &quot;Encino Man&quot;.

In July 2016, Hebner was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that performers incurred &quot;long term neurological injuries&quot; and that the company &quot;routinely failed to care&quot; for them and &quot;fraudulently misrepresented and concealed&quot; the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE, primarily over chronic traumatic encephalopathy, an issue that has risen to the forefront of sports-related injuries, especially after the Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide. In September 2018, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit.

<doc id="674493" wikidata="Q715596" url="?curid=674493" title="Juan Belmonte">
<text>Juan Belmonte García (14 April 1892 – 8 April 1962) was a Spanish bullfighter. He fought in a record number of bull fights and was responsible for changing the art of bullfighting. He had minor deformities in his legs which forced him to design new techniques and styles of bullfighting.

==Life==
Born in Seville, his family moved to the Triana neighbourhood when he was three, according to the biographer A. Diaz Canabate. Belmonte began his bullfighting career in 1908, touring around Spain in a children&#x27;s bullfighting group called &quot;Los Niños Sevillanos&quot;. He killed his first bull on 24 July 1910. As an adult, his technique was unlike that of previous matadors; he stood erect and nearly motionless, and always stayed within inches of the bull, unlike previous matadors, who stayed far from the animal to avoid the horns. As a result of this daring technique, Belmonte was frequently gored, sustaining many serious wounds.

One such incident occurred during a November 1927 bullfight in Barcelona, Spain. Belmonte was gored through his chest and pinned against a wall. Several other toreros rescued him. Among the spectators that day were the King and Queen of Spain and the Infanta Beatriz.

Belmonte&#x27;s rivalry with José Gómez Ortega (a.k.a. &quot;Joselito&quot; or &quot;Gallito&quot;), another contender for the appellation &quot;greatest matador of all time&quot;, from 1914 to 1920 is known as the Golden Age of Bullfighting. The era was cut short when Joselito was fatally gored on 16 May 1920, at the age of 25, at a bullfight in Talavera de la Reina, a small town not far from Madrid. Belmonte then had to carry alone the weight of the whole bullfighting establishment, which proved to be unbearable, and which in 1922 led to the first of his three temporary retirements.

In 1919, Belmonte fought 109 bullfights (corridas), a number unmatched by any matador before, until the 1965 bullfight season when Manuel Benítez Pérez (&quot;El Cordobés&quot;) performed in 111 corridas, surpassing Belmonte&#x27;s record. The Mexican matador Carlos Arruza fought 108 corridas in one season but it is said that he refused to pass Belmonte&#x27;s record out of respect for the maestro.

After his third and final retirement in 1935, Belmonte moved to a 3,500-acre (1400 ha) ranch in Andalusia, where he &quot;lived the life of a gentleman bull-breeder&quot;. He also published a (ghostwritten) autobiography. Written by Manuel Chaves Nogales and published in 1937, it was called &quot;Juan Belmonte, matador de toros: su vida y sus hazañas&quot; (Juan Belmonte, killer of bulls: his life and deeds) and consisted of his story as told to Nogales. The book was translated into English by Leslie Charteris as &quot;Juan Belmonte, Killer of Bulls&quot;. Belmonte was also a close friend of authors Henry de Montherlant and Ernest Hemingway, and he appears in two of Hemingway&#x27;s books: &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; and &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. Like Hemingway, Belmonte committed suicide by gunshot.

Juan Belmonte was the single matador that changed the style of bullfighting. Born with slightly deformed legs, he could not run or jump like other boys and so when he finally began his career as a matador, he firmly planted his feet on the ground, never giving way. He forced the bull to go around him, whereas others until then had jumped almost constantly like circus performers.

During his bullfighting career he received 24 serious wounds and &#x27;countless minor ones&#x27;. He later developed a grave heart condition, identified by a Madrid specialist who advised him to &#x27;go easy&#x27; and to stop riding, an instruction that he initially took to heart but, in the last spring of his life, disobeyed in order to ride his favourite horse, Maravilla, on the ranch with his son. Shortly before his death he learned that he had lung cancer. After a final morning ride, he returned home to his ranch house, took his 6.35mm pistol from a drawer in his study and shot himself. He died within a week of his 70th birthday. Berman and Wallace suggest that this may have been a &#x27;copycat suicide&#x27;; on hearing of his friend Hemingway&#x27;s suicide in 1961, Belmonte is said to have answered &#x27;Well done.&#x27;

The circumstances surrounding his death are the source of some controversy. A popular version, seen for example in Life, describes events substantially as follows: when Belmonte&#x27;s doctor told him that, because of his lifelong injuries and trauma, he could no longer smoke cigars, ride his horses, drink wine or perform sexual acts with women, he decided he was ready to die. He ordered that his favourite horse be brought to him, took a handful of cigars, two bottles of his favourite wine and rode out to his &quot;finca&quot;.
A film about his life, &quot;Belmonte&quot;, was released in 1995.

He is interred at the cemetery of Seville, 18 m from the grave of his rival of seven seasons, Joselito. His wish was to be buried in the robe of his Holy Week fraternity. At the time of Belmonte&#x27;s death, Catholic rules prescribed against suicide victims&#x27; being buried in consecrated ground. According to today&#x27;s more pastoral norms, a suicide victim is considered to be temporarily insane, and thus might be accorded Catholic burial. Nevertheless, Belmonte&#x27;s death provoked a strong sadness in the city of Seville.

==In popular culture==

Belmonte appears as a character in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; as a friend of Ernest Hemingway, who considers him to be &quot;truly brave&quot;. He is portrayed by Swedish actor Daniel Lundh.

Ernest Hemingway features Belmonte in &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; and as a minor character in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

<text>Sir Herbert Edward Read, (; 4 December 1893 – 12 June 1968) was an English art historian, poet, literary critic and philosopher, best known for numerous books on art, which included influential volumes on the role of art in education. Read was co-founder of the Institute of Contemporary Arts. As well as being a prominent English anarchist, he was one of the earliest English writers to take notice of existentialism. He was co-editor with Michael Fordham and Gerhard Adler of the British edition in English of &quot;The Collected Works of C. G. Jung&quot;.

He was a professor of fine art at Edinburgh University from 1931 to 1933, a lecturer in art at the University of Liverpool (1935-36), Leon Fellow at University of London (1940-42), and Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry at Harvard University (1953-54).

==Early life==
The eldest of four children of tenant farmer Herbert Edward Read (1868–1903), and his wife Eliza Strickland, Read was born at Muscoates Grange, near Nunnington, about four miles south of Kirkbymoorside in the North Riding of Yorkshire. In &quot;Herbert Read- The Stream and the Source&quot; (1972), George Woodcock wrote: &quot;rural memories are long... nearly sixty years after Read&#x27;s father... had died and the family had left Muscoates, I heard it said that &#x27;the Reads were snobs&#x27;. They employed a governess (and) rode to hounds...&quot; After his father&#x27;s death, the family, being tenants rather than owners, had to leave the farm; Read was sent to a school for orphans at Halifax, West Yorkshire, and his mother took a job managing laundry in Leeds, where Read later joined her. Read&#x27;s studies at the University of Leeds were interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, during which he served with the Green Howards in France. He was commissioned in January 1915, and received both the Military Cross (MC) and the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) &quot;for conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty&quot; in 1918. He reached the rank of captain.

During the war, Read founded the journal &quot;Arts &amp; Letters&quot; with Frank Rutter, one of the first literary periodicals to publish work by T. S. Eliot.

==Early work==
Read&#x27;s first volume of poetry was &quot;Songs of Chaos&quot;, self-published in 1915. His second collection, published in 1919, was called &quot;Naked Warriors&quot;, and drew on his experiences fighting in the trenches of the First World War. His work, which shows the influence of Imagism and the Metaphysical poets, was mainly in free verse. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; appeared in 1946. As a critic of literature, Read mainly concerned himself with the English Romantic poets (for example, &quot;The True Voice of Feeling: Studies in English Romantic Poetry&quot;, 1953) but was also a close observer of imagism. He published a novel, &quot;The Green Child&quot;. He contributed to the &quot;Criterion&quot; (1922–39) and he was for many years a regular art critic for &quot;The Listener&quot;.

While W. B. Yeats chose many poets of the Great War generation for &quot;The Oxford Book of Modern Verse&quot; (1936), Read arguably stood out among his peers by virtue of the 17-page excerpt (nearly half of the entire work) of his &quot;The End of a War&quot; (Faber &amp; Faber, 1933).

Read was also interested in the art of writing. He cared deeply about style and structure and summarized his views in &quot;English Prose Style&quot; (1928), a primer on, and a philosophy of, good writing. The book is considered one of the best on the foundations of the English language, and how those foundations can be and have been used to write English with elegance and distinction.

==Art criticism==
Read was a champion of modern British artists such as Paul Nash, Ben Nicholson, Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth. He became associated with Nash&#x27;s contemporary arts group Unit One. Read was professor of fine arts at the University of Edinburgh (1931–33) and editor of &quot;The Burlington Magazine&quot; (1933–38). He was one of the organisers of the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936 and editor of the book &quot;Surrealism&quot;, published in 1936, which included contributions from André Breton, Hugh Sykes Davies, Paul Éluard, and Georges Hugnet. He also served as a trustee of the Tate Gallery and as a curator at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (1922–31), as well as co-founding the Institute of Contemporary Arts with Roland Penrose in 1947. He was one of the earliest English writers to take notice of existentialism, and was strongly influenced by proto-existentialist thinker Max Stirner.

From 1953 to 1954 Read served as the Norton Professor at Harvard University. In that final year, he gave the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts at the National Gallery of Art. For the academic year 1964–65 and again in 1965, he was a Fellow on the faculty at the Center for Advanced Studies of Wesleyan University.

==Poetry==
Read&#x27;s conception of poetry was influenced by his mentors T. E. Hulme, F. S. Flint, Marianne Moore and W. C. Williams, believing &quot;true poetry was never speech but always a song&quot;, quoted with the rest of his definition &#x27;What is a Poem&#x27; in his 1926 essay of that name (in his endword to his Collected Poems of 1966). 

Read&#x27;s &quot;Phases of English Poetry&quot; was an evolutionary study seeking to answer metaphysical rather than pragmatic questions.

Read&#x27;s definitive guide to poetry however, was his &quot;Form in Modern Poetry&quot;, which he published in 1932. In 1951, literary critic A. S. Collins said of Read: &quot;In his poetry he burnt the white ecstasy of intellect, terse poetry of austere beauty retaining much of his earliest Imagist style.&quot; This style was evident in Read&#x27;s earliest collection, &quot;Eclogues&quot; 1914-18.

==Anarchism and philosophical outlook==
Politically, Read considered himself an anarchist, albeit in the English quietist tradition of Edward Carpenter and William Morris. Nevertheless, in the 1953 New Year Honours he accepted a knighthood for &quot;services to literature&quot;; this caused Read to be ostracized by most of the anarchist movement. Read was actively opposed to the Franco regime in Spain,
and often campaigned on behalf of political prisoners in Spain. He was the chairman of the Freedom Defence Committee founded in 1945. In 1964 Read joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

Dividing Read&#x27;s writings on politics from those on art and culture is difficult, because he saw art, culture and politics as a single congruent expression of human consciousness. His total work amounts to over 1,000 published titles.

Read&#x27;s book &quot;To Hell With Culture&quot; deals specifically with his disdain for the term &quot;culture&quot; and expands on his anarchist view of the artist as artisan, as well as presenting a major analysis of the work of Eric Gill. It was republished by Routledge in 2002.

In his philosophical outlook, Read was close to the European idealist traditions represented by Friedrich Schelling, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, believing that reality as it is experienced by the human mind was as much a product of the human mind as any external or objective actuality. In other words, the mind is not a camera recording the reality it perceives through the eyes; it is also a projector throwing out its own reality. This meant that art was not, as many Marxists believed, simply a product of a bourgeois society, but a psychological process that had evolved simultaneously with the evolution of consciousness. Art was, therefore, a biological phenomenon, a view that frequently pitted Read against Marxist critics such as Anthony Blunt in the 1930s. Read, in this respect, was influenced by developments in German art psychology. His Idealist background also led Read towards an interest in psychoanalysis. Read became a pioneer in the English-speaking world in the use of psychoanalysis as a tool for art and literary criticism. Originally a Freudian, Read came to transfer his allegiance to the analytical psychology of Carl Jung, eventually becoming both publisher and editor-in-chief of Jung&#x27;s collected works in English.

As early as 1949, Read took an interest in the writings of the French Existentialists, particularly those of Jean-Paul Sartre. Although Read never described himself as an existentialist, he did acknowledge that his theories often found support among those who did. Read perhaps was the closest England came to an existentialist theorist of the European tradition.

== Views on education ==
Read developed a strong interest in the subject of education and particularly in art education. Read&#x27;s anarchism was influenced by William Godwin, Peter Kropotkin and Max Stirner. Read &quot;became deeply interested in children&#x27;s drawings and paintings after having been invited to collect works for an exhibition of British art that would tour allied and neutral countries during the Second World War. As it was considered too risky to transport across the Atlantic works of established importance to the national heritage, it was proposed that children’s drawings and paintings should be sent instead. Read, in making his collection, was unexpectedly moved by the expressive power and emotional content of some of the younger artists&#x27; works. The experience prompted his special attention to their cultural value, and his engagement of the theory of children&#x27;s creativity with seriousness matching his devotion to the avant-garde. This work both changed fundamentally his own life’s work throughout his remaining 25 years and provided art education with a rationale of unprecedented lucidity and persuasiveness. Key books and pamphlets resulted: &quot;Education through Art&quot; (Read, 1943); &quot;The Education of Free Men&quot; (Read, 1944); &quot;Culture and Education in a World Order&quot; (Read, 1948); &quot;The Grass Read&quot;, (1955); and &quot;Redemption of the Robot&quot; (1966)&quot;.

Read &quot;&quot;elaborated a socio-cultural dimension of creative education, offering the notion of greater international understanding and cohesiveness rooted in principles of developing the fully balanced personality through art education. Read argued in Education through Art that &quot;every child, is said to be a potential neurotic capable of being saved from this prospect, if early, largely inborn, creative abilities were not repressed by conventional Education. Everyone is an artist of some kind whose special abilities, even if almost insignificant, must be encouraged as contributing to an infinite richness of collective life. Read&#x27;s newly expressed view of an essential &#x27;continuity&#x27; of child and adult creativity in everyone represented a synthesis&#x27; the two opposed models of twentieth-century art education that had predominated until this point...Read did not offer a curriculum but a theoretical defence of the genuine and true. His claims for genuineness and truth were based on the overwhelming evidence of characteristics revealed in his study of child art...From 1946 until his death in 1968 he was president of the Society for Education in Art (SEA), the renamed ATG, in which capacity he had a platform for addressing UNESCO...On the basis of such representation Read, with others, succeeded in establishing the International Society for Education through Art (INSEA) as an executive arm of UNESCO in 1954.&quot;&quot;

==Death and legacy==

Following his death in 1968, Read was probably neglected due to the increasing predominance in academia of theories of art, including Marxism, which discounted his ideas. Yet his work continued to have influence. It was through Read&#x27;s writings on anarchism that Murray Bookchin was inspired in the mid-1960s to explore the connections between anarchism and ecology. In 1971, a collection of his writings on anarchism and politics was republished, &quot;Anarchy and Order,&quot; with an introduction by Howard Zinn. In the 1990s, there was a revival of interest in him following a major exhibition in 1993 at Leeds City Art Gallery and the publication of a collection of his anarchist writings, &quot;A One-Man Manifesto and other writings for Freedom Press&quot;, edited by David Goodway. Since then, more of his work has been republished and there was a &quot;Herbert Read Conference&quot;, at Tate Britain in June 2004. The library at the Cyprus College of Art is named after him, as is the art gallery at the University for the Creative Arts at Canterbury. Until the 1990s the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London staged an annual Herbert Read Lecture, which included well-known speakers such as Salman Rushdie.

On 11 November 1985, Read was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

A 1937 reading by Read lasting seven minutes and titled &quot;The Surrealist Object&quot; can be heard on the audiobook CD &quot;Surrealism Reviewed&quot;, published in 2002.

He was the father of the well-known writer Piers Paul Read, the BBC documentary maker John Read, the BBC producer and executive Tom Read, and the art historian Ben Read.

<doc id="674497" wikidata="Q5183585" url="?curid=674497" title="Creative services">
<text>Creative services are a subsector of the creative industries, a part of the economy that creates wealth by offering creativity for hire to other businesses. Creative Services also means a department within a company that does creative work such as writing, designing, and production. It is often a sub-department of the Marketing organization. Examples include:

*Design and production agencies
** Studios 
** Ideation consultancies
** Software development firms
*Marketing firms 
**Public relations agencies
**Advertising agencies
**Promotional agencies
**Branding agencies
*Entertainment Industries 
** Talent agency
** Guilds

Like lawyers and accountants in the professional services sector, creative services firms sell a specialised technical service to satisfy the needs of companies that do not have this expertise themselves.

Creative services firms provide creative services to other companies or to the public: they &#x27;do creativity&#x27; to order.

Typical business models revolve around selling the time of skilled professionals, either on a project-by-project basis or through a service level agreement, and providing services on an ongoing basis for a fixed monthly fee. In this sense they share much in common with professional services firms but there are also key differences: 
* Creative services firms tend not to be bound by requirements for professional accreditation
* There are low barriers to entry for new startup businesses

Her film appearances include &quot;Krull&quot; (1983), &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;The Debt Collector&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Libertine&quot; (2004).

==Early life and education==
Annis was born in Kensington, London, in 1945, to an English father, Lester William Anthony Annis (1914–2001), and a Brazilian-French mother, Mariquita (Mara) Purcell (1913–2009). Both were sometime actors and Mara a sometime singer. Mara was from a wealthy Brazilian family. The Annises moved to Brazil when Francesca was one year old, and spent six years there, returning to England when she was seven. In recollecting the years in Brazil, she described her parents as running &quot;a nightclub on Copacabana beach&quot;, and her mother Mara &quot;performing as a blues singer&quot;.

Annis was educated at a convent school, and trained in her early years as a ballet dancer, with training in the Russian style at the Corona Stage Academy.

==Career==
Annis began acting professionally in her teens, and made her film debut in &quot;The Cat Gang&quot; (1959). Her first major film role was as Elizabeth Taylor&#x27;s handmaiden in &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), in which she was cast at the age of 16 while still studying Russian ballet. Her big break was as one of the leads in the 1965 West End stage musical &quot;Passion Flower Hotel&quot;. She played Estella in a television adaptation of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1967) and presented children&#x27;s television programmes. She garnered attention for her performance as Lady Macbeth in Roman Polanski&#x27;s film version of &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1971) in which she performs the sleepwalking soliloquy nude. The critic Kenneth Tynan was present when the scene was shot:&quot;Francesca does it very sportingly and with no fuss ... though of course the set is closed, great curtains are drawn around the acting area ... and the wardrobe mistress rushes to cover Francesca with a dressing gown the instant Roman says, &#x27;Cut&#x27;&quot;.

Annis played the &quot;Widow of the Web&quot; in the 1983 science fantasy film &quot;Krull&quot;, and starred as Lady Jessica in the 1984 David Lynch science fiction film &quot;Dune&quot;. 

She appeared as Tuppence with James Warwick as Tommy Beresford in the pilot film &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot; (1983) and the subsequent TV series, &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Partners in Crime&quot; (1983–84). Annis played Jacqueline Kennedy in &quot;Onassis: The Richest Man in the World&quot; in 1988. She portrayed Mrs Wellington in the second film and directorial debut by Prince, &quot;Under The Cherry Moon&quot; (1986).

Annis pursued a stage career, playing leading roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, such as Luciana in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s musical version of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; (1976) and Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; alongside Ian McKellen (1976). 

At the National Theatre in 1981, she played Natalya Petrovna in Peter Gill&#x27;s production of Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. At the Comedy Theatre between September 2005 and January 2006, Annis starred as Ruth in &quot;Epitaph for George Dillon&quot; with Joseph Fiennes. She returned to the stage in April 2009, to star as Mrs Conway in Rupert Goold&#x27;s National Theatre revival of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Time and the Conways&quot;.

She appeared in television productions in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in series such as &quot;Edward the Seventh&quot; (1975) as Lillie Langtry, a role she reprised in &quot;Lillie&quot; (1978); &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1975); and &quot;Parnell and the Englishwoman&quot; (1991), in which she played Kitty O&#x27;Shea. She played a major role in J. C. Wilsher&#x27;s police drama &quot;Between the Lines&quot; from 1993 to 1994, as well as the miniseries &quot;Reckless&quot; (1998) and its 2000 sequel. Annis co-starred with Sir Michael Gambon and Dame Judi Dench as Lady Ludlow (an aristocrat opposed to the education of the lower classes) in the BBC1 costume-drama series &quot;Cranford&quot; (2007). More recently, Annis played a leading role in the ITV drama &quot;Home Fires&quot;.

==Personal life==
Annis was in a relationship with photographer Patrick Wiseman that began in 1974, raising three children, Charlotte, Taran, and Andreas. Annis began a relationship with &quot;Hamlet&quot; co-star Ralph Fiennes in 1995, ending her 23-year relationship with Wiseman in 1997; Fiennes in turn divorced his wife of four years, Alex Kingston. Annis is said to have &quot;apologised to Wiseman&quot; over their parting. Annis and Fiennes announced their separation on 7 February 2006, after 11 years together, in a parting described as &quot;acrimonious,&quot; following rumours that he had had an affair with the Romanian singer Cornelia Crisan.

At age 64, in an interview with Tim Auld of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2009, Annis described herself as being one that tends &quot;to forget the bad things – I don&#x27;t dwell on them. I think, &#x27;Oh, f– it, life&#x27;s too short&#x27;&quot; and that though single, she believes &quot;it is better to be with someone than alone,&quot; stating &quot;I think you live a fuller life... to have someone else&#x27;s input on anything – a book, a meal, your children, life, a walk – is fantastic&quot; and expressing optimism as she looked to her future, stating &quot;&#x27;I like to have a big open canvas. I am a glass-half-full person. Something will turn up, you know, and whatever it is it&#x27;ll be fine.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="674503" wikidata="Q4386316" url="?curid=674503" title="Nick Patrick (referee)">
<text>Joseph Nicholas Patrick Hamilton Jr. (born November 9, 1959), better known by his ring name Nick Patrick, is a retired American professional wrestling referee. He is a former referee for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). He has also served as head referee for former WWE developmental territory Deep South Wrestling (DSW) until that company&#x27;s closing, and is former head referee for Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).

==Early life==
Hamilton is the son of wrestling legend Jody Hamilton, who wrestled as The Assassin.

==Career==
===Georgia Championship Wrestling (1980–1984)===
He was a referee in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)&#x27;s Georgia Championship Wrestling starting in 1980 under the name Nick Patrick, as he wanted to make a name for himself without his father&#x27;s help.

===Brief wrestling career (1984–1985)===
In June 1984, Patrick transitioned into a wrestler, teaming with his father. In CWG, Patrick was in a feud with Bob Roop, which resulted in a series of Lights Out matches, where they traded victories. In 1985, he moved to the Gulf Coast for Continental Championship Wrestling, frequently teaming with Steve Armstrong, feuding with The Nightmares. By October 1985, he moved on to Mid-South Wrestling, where he was used as an enhancement talent. By the end of 1985, Patrick suffered a knee injury that ended his wrestling career.

===Deep South Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling (1986–2001)===
After his wrestling career was cut short due to a knee injury, Patrick would help his father out in his promotion, Deep South Wrestling, as an announcer/color commentator. In 1988, when Turner Broadcasting bought JCP and renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW), Patrick was brought in as a referee. After Tommy Young retired in November 1989, Patrick became WCW&#x27;s senior referee.

When the New World Order (nWo) formed in 1996, he joined and became their official referee. He would allow the nWo wrestlers to cheat and he would show a clear bias towards the nWo. Because of this, he was forced into a match against Chris Jericho at the World War 3 pay-per-view on November 24, 1996, in Norfolk, Virginia. Jericho had one arm tied behind his back and still defeated Patrick.

Patrick&#x27;s biggest night with the nWo was refereeing every single match on the nWo Souled Out pay-per-view on January 25, 1997, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

His nWo tenure came to an end at Spring Stampede 1997. Scott Hall and Kevin Nash were scheduled to defend the WCW World Tag Team Championship against The Steiner Brothers. Due to out-of-ring attacks and such, combined with Hall failing to show for the event, the title match eventually became a singles match between Nash and Rick Steiner. Nash was allowed to appoint a referee and he chose Patrick. During the match, Nash removed the padding over the turnbuckle and dropped Steiner&#x27;s face on it. However, in a turn of events, Patrick was starting to become visibly uncomfortable with how Nash was treating Steiner and would soon have a change of heart. Fellow nWo associate Ted DiBiase also had a change of heart and attempted, with Patrick, to get Nash to stop. When Nash refused, DiBiase left to get help for Steiner. Nash covered an unconscious Steiner and Patrick didn&#x27;t want to make the 3-count until Nash forced him to, awarding the contest to Nash. Patrick then told Nash to stop as he would also leave to get help for Steiner. After the match, Nash kept performing the maneuver on Steiner. Later that evening, Patrick served as referee for the main event match between nWo member Randy Savage and Diamond Dallas Page, counting a proper pin for Page. After the match, Nash came out and attacked Patrick, for all intents and purposes, kicking him out of the nWo.

On the April 21, 1997 edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;, he unexpectedly appeared at the broadcast desk with Tony Schiavone and Larry Zbyszko. Wearing a green WCW polo shirt, he cut a promo explaining that he was sick of Eric Bischoff and the way the nWo did business. He explained that he never wanted to fight fellow referee Randy Anderson and asked for his job back. Both Schiavone and Zbyszko were skeptical, especially Zbyszko, who was intensely critical. They went to a commercial break with Patrick and Zbyszko arguing. The next week on &quot;Nitro&quot;, WCW executive J. J. Dillon re-hired Patrick on a probationary basis. Patrick was a neutral referee from that point on and never sided with the nWo again.

Patrick created massive controversy during the WCW World Heavyweight Championship match between Sting and Hollywood Hogan at Starrcade 1997; he was supposed to make a &quot;fast count&quot; but botched it by counting at normal speed. Bret Hart stopped Patrick from giving Hogan the title, claiming the fast-count, and restarted the match claiming that he didn&#x27;t want to see Sting get screwed like he was. After a rematch, the title was declared vacant. Patrick would referee another rematch for the vacant belt, taking over for Charles Robinson (who had been knocked out during the match). Sting would win that match.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2008)===
When WCW was bought by the WWF, he was one of three WCW referees who had their contracts purchased, along with Charles Robinson and Billy Silverman. He became a referee for The Alliance of WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) wrestlers trying to take over the WWF. He even had a match against Earl Hebner at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view on July 22, 2001, in Cleveland, Ohio. Patrick lost to Hebner and Mick Foley, the special guest referee, gave him &quot;Mr. Socko&quot; after the match.

During the time of the Alliance, Patrick continued to play a heel referee, siding with the Alliance wrestlers over the WWF wrestlers. For example, during a WCW Championship handicap match between The Rock and Booker T and Shane McMahon at Unforgiven, Patrick refused to count when The Rock had Booker T or Shane pinned down. At Survivor Series, Patrick knocked out Hebner to take over as referee during the &quot;Winner Take All&quot; elimination tag match. After he gave a normal &quot;slow count&quot; for The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin became enraged, knocked Patrick out, and brought Hebner back in as referee. After the Alliance angle ended, Patrick became an official WWF referee. At first he was a heel referee, refusing to count to three for face wrestlers as Austin and The Rock, and favoring heel wrestlers like Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle. After WrestleMania X8, Patrick started portraying a neutral referee once again.

After the brand split, Patrick became head referee on the SmackDown! brand. He officiated the World Heavyweight Championship match at ECW One Night Stand 2006 between champion Rey Mysterio and Sabu.

Patrick left the SmackDown! brand on February 9, 2007, and Mickie Henson took over as senior referee. Patrick remained with WWE, officiating matches in their new developmental territory, Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).

Patrick returned to the SmackDown brand on February 8, 2008, and refereed a tag team match between Jesse and Festus and Deuce &#x27;n Domino. However, he quickly disappeared again due to his injuries.

Patrick was released from the WWE on August 8, 2008, after seven months of inactivity due to a chronic back injury.

===Retirement (2009–2010)===
On February 15, 2009, Patrick officially returned to wrestling when he was introduced as the on-camera commissioner of Rampage Pro Wrestling, an independent promotion based out of Warner Robins, Georgia. Patrick portrayed a neutral commissioner. Patrick refereed his first match since his WWE release at RPW&#x27;s &quot;Showdown&quot; supercard at the Macon City Auditorium on April 10, 2009, officiating a no-holds-barred, hair vs. hair contest between Cru Jones and Doc Gayton.

In April 2009, Patrick became RPW&#x27;s television show director, replacing his father, Jody Hamilton, after the promotion released Hamilton due to financial cutbacks. The promotion re-hired Hamilton later in the year in October. In September 2009, Patrick became the promotion&#x27;s legitimate general manager. When Patrick took over, he and Hamilton became the primary forces behind the booking. In June 2010, the promotion was temporarily closed down due to internal disputes he and his father were having with others in RPW. The company decided to move forward, but not before firing everyone involved in the disputes, including Patrick and Hamilton. A few days later, Patrick signed on to become the general manager of Great Championship Wrestling, an independent promotion based out of Phenix City, Alabama. However, Patrick resigned from GCW after only two weeks.

===Promoting (2021–present)===
In February 2021, Patrick revived his father&#x27;s old promotion, Deep South Wrestling.

Patrick is featured in the WWE video game series with appearances in &quot;WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007&quot;, &quot;WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2008&quot;, and &quot;WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2009&quot;.

<doc id="674507" wikidata="Q1377519" url="?curid=674507" title="European School">
<text>A European School () is a type of international school emphasising a multilingual and multicultural pedagogical approach to the teaching of nursery, primary and secondary students, leading to the European Baccalaureate as their secondary leaving qualification. Each European School is set up, financed, and operated by the international organisation, the &quot;European Schools&quot;, controlled jointly by the member states of the European Union and the European Commission. The schools prioritise, for enrolment purposes, the children of EU staff.

The first European School, founded in Luxembourg, in 1953, had the objective of providing an education to the children of employees of the institutions of the European Coal and Steel Community — a forerunner of today&#x27;s European Union. Originally, a private initiative of employees of the ECSC, the concept attracted the attention of EU founding father, Jean Monnet as capturing the spirit of the post-war effort to reconcile and integrate Europe.

As of September 2017, there are thirteen European Schools located in six EU member states in close proximity to European institutions.

Since 2005, upon a recommendation of the European Parliament, the title of an &quot;Accredited European School&quot; has been available for schools under national jurisdiction and financing, which have been approved, by the Board of Governors of the European Schools, to offer the European Schools&#x27; curriculum and the European Baccalaureate.

==Legal status==
The schools, despite their close connection to the EU, are neither EU bodies, nor under the full jurisdiction of the individual member states of the European Union. They are instead administered and financed through the international organisation &quot;The European Schools&quot;, established by means of an intergovernmental treaty, the 1957 Statute of the European School, since repealed and replaced by the 1994 Convention Defining the Statute of the European Schools. All EU member states, as well as the EU itself, and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) are party to this agreement. As part of the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU, it will remain party to the convention until the end of the academic year ongoing at the end of the transition period. The Schools are legally recognised in all participating jurisdictions as public bodies.

==Locations==

There are thirteen European Schools, (sometimes designated as &quot;Type 1&quot; European Schools in official documents) found in eight municipalities, across six EU countries, in close proximity to EU institutions, or in the case of the European School, Munich, the European Patent Organisation. There are currently five European Schools in Belgium (four in Brussels and one in Mol) and discussions are currently being held about building a fifth school in Brussels, to open in 2027.

In 2017, with the relocation of European Union-seconded researchers and their families following the formation of the successor project to the Joint European Torus fusion energy research programme, the European School, Culham was closed. The school affirmed this move was not connected with Brexit.

On 9 July 2021 the decision was made to move the Netherlands-based school from Bergen, to Alkmaar.

==Curriculum==

The curriculum is common to all thirteen schools and is centrally controlled by the Board of Inspectors and the Board of Governors.

=== Secondary level ===
Compulsory subjects for Years 1–7 of the secondary school:
* First language (normally mother tongue)
* Second language (Usually one of English, French or German, with some schools providing a local language such as Spanish, Italian, Danish or Dutch as alternate option)
* Mathematics
* History (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Geography (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Ethics/religion (instructed in second language from Year 3)
* Physical education (instruction in second language is possible from Year 3)
Compulsory for Years 1–3 of the secondary school:
*Art 
*Music
Compulsory subjects for Years 1–5 of the secondary school:
*Third language (any EU official language, as long as a minimum number of students choose it in the same school) 
*Natural sciences: physics, chemistry and biology (usually combined for Years 1–3)
Compulsory subjects for Years 6–7 of the secondary school:
* Philosophy
* Physics and/or chemistry and/or biology (at least one science subject is obligatory)
Optional subjects:
* ICT (instructed in second language) and Latin in Year 2—3 and 4—5 (you can stop between the first and second cycle of Latin)
*Economics (instructed in second language), music, or a fourth and fifth language in Years 4–7

=== Foreign language education ===
All modern foreign languages offered are taught using the direct method where the lessons are taught in the language being learned, and the use of the student&#x27;s native tongue is discouraged. These foreign languages lessons are shared with pupils from other language streams. The idea is to encourage the pupils to use the language they are learning as a means of crossing the communication barrier between themselves and pupils from other language streams. From Year 3 onwards of the secondary school, History and Geography as well as other secondary subjects such as Music are taught in each student&#x27;s second language. Many of the pupils find themselves in a foreign country, so are surrounded by a foreign language. Some pick it up through language immersion, hence some lessons are taught in the national language of the host country.

===European Baccalaureate===

The European Baccalaureate is the leaving certification of the European Schools, and should be distinguished from the International Baccalaureate (IB) and the baccalaureates of various national systems. It is a two-year course assessing the performance of students in the subjects taught in Years 6–7, and culminating in a final series exams taken at the end of Year 7. As per the multilingual ethos of the Schools, certain subjects are instructed and assessed in each student&#x27;s respective second language. Details of the examinations are set out in the Annex of the Statute of the European School and in the regulations for the European Baccalaureate.

Those students undertaking the European Baccalaureate are required to study at least 8 and up to a maximum of 11 academic subjects, in addition to physical education and moral/religion, with different weightings according to the course choices made when commencing the Baccaluareate. The final mark is calculated as a percentage, where 50% is the minimum for a pass.

The European Baccalaureate is administered and directly supervised by an external examining board appointed annually by the Board of Governors. The examining board consists of up to three representatives of each member state, who must satisfy the conditions governing the appointment of equivalent examining boards in their respective countries. It is presided over by a senior university educator appointed by each member state in turn, assisted by a member of the Board of Inspectors of the Schools.

Article 5 (2) of the Statute provides that holders of the Baccalaureate shall:

*enjoy, in the Member State of which they are nationals, all the benefits attaching to the possession of the diploma or certificate awarded at the end of secondary school education in that country; and
*be entitled to seek admission to any university in the territory of any Member State on the same terms as nationals of that Member State with equivalent qualifications.

The first awards of the European Baccalaureate were made in 1959.

==Common extracurricular activities and events==
Sports teams of the European Schools compete in the biennial Eurosport event, with the schools alternating as hosts. In addition, students of the schools have the opportunity to take part in the annual European Schools Science Composium, the winners of which represent the European Schools in the European Union Contest for Young Scientists.

The European Schools also cooperate to take advantage of their unique relationship to EU institutions to provide students on an annual basis with the opportunity to take part in political simulations of EU meetings, held on the premises of the institutions themselves. Students get the opportunity to role-play as delegates of EU member state governments in a Model European Council, MEPs in a Model European Parliament, or international journalists covering the meetings.

The federation of student representatives of the schools, CoSup, organises a &quot;Europarty&quot;, held in a different European city each academic year, and open to any student of the European Schools over 16 years of age to attend.

<text>Robert Charles Nieman (January 26, 1927 – March 10, 1985) was an American professional baseball player and scout. An outfielder, he spent all or parts of a dozen Major League Baseball seasons with the St. Louis Browns (1951–52), Detroit Tigers (1953–54), Chicago White Sox (1955–56), Baltimore Orioles (1956–59), St. Louis Cardinals (1960–61), Cleveland Indians (1961–62) and San Francisco Giants (1962). He also played one season in Japan for the Chunichi Dragons (1963). He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

==Career==
===Minor leagues===
Nieman was born in Cincinnati. After attending Kent State University, he was signed by his hometown Reds as an amateur free agent in 1948. He spent three full seasons and part of a fourth in the Cincinnati farm system, although he played only 38 games above the Class A level. In June 1951, he was acquired by the unaffiliated Oklahoma City Indians from the Reds&#x27; Tulsa Oilers farm team, and he played 109 games for the 1951 Indians and batted .328. (His combined average, his tenure with Tulsa included, of .324 won him the batting title of the Texas League.)

===Major leagues===
Nieman then was purchased by the Browns and was added to their active roster in September 1951, setting the stage for his dramatic big league debut. On September 14, at Fenway Park, Nieman hit two home runs in his first two major league at-bats. The blows—a solo home run in the second inning and a two-run shot in the third—were hit off Red Sox left-hander Mickey McDermott. Nieman added a single and drove in three runs on the day, but Boston won the game, 9–6. Nieman became the first player in big league history to hit two homers in his first game. Bert Campaneris (1964), Mark Quinn (1999), J.P. Arencibia (2010) and Trevor Story (2016) are the only others to accomplish the feat. Also, Nieman is one of two players in MLB history to homer in each of his first two big league at bats. Keith McDonald, in 2000, became the other.

Nieman became an everyday outfielder for the Browns, later played regularly for the Tigers and Orioles, and overall he fashioned a 12-year career as a semi-regular outfielder and pinch hitter. In his 1,113-game career he batted .295, with 125 home runs, 544 RBI, 455 runs, 1,018 hits, 180 doubles, 32 triples and 10 stolen bases. He batted over .300 three times, twice as a regular outfielder with more than 400 at bats.

In his final MLB campaign, he collected eight pinch hits to help the Giants win the 1962 National League pennant. In the 1962 World Series, and in his only postseason opportunity and last big-league plate appearance, Nieman pinch hit for Ed Bailey in the seventh inning of Game 4 at Yankee Stadium. He drew a base on balls against left-hander Marshall Bridges and was removed for a pinch runner, Ernie Bowman. Bowman would soon score when Giants&#x27; second baseman Chuck Hiller hit the first grand slam home run ever struck by a National League player in World Series history. The Giants won that contest, 7–3, but dropped the series in seven games.

===Scout===
After retiring from the field, Nieman served as a scout for over two decades, working for the Indians, Dodgers, Athletics, White Sox and Yankees. 

He died as a result of a massive heart attack in Corona, California, at 58 years of age.

<text>William Keith McDonald (born February 8, 1973) is a former Major League Baseball catcher and right-handed batter. He made his debut with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2000. He attended Esperanza High School in Anaheim, California.

On July 4, 2000 McDonald became the third player in St. Louis history to hit a home run in his first major league at-bat. On July 6, he homered in his second at-bat, becoming only the second player in MLB history to hit home runs in each of his first two big league at bats. Bob Nieman, in 1951, is the other. McDonald hit a third home run that year. McDonald has the most home runs of any MLB player not to have had any other hits.

In his first season McDonald batted .429 (3-7), with three homers, five RBI and three runs in six games. He returned the following season as a September call-up, and was hitless in two at-bats.

<text>Simon Marks, 1st Baron Marks of Broughton (9 July 1888 – 8 December 1964), was an English retail businessman and baron, the son of Michael Marks, the co-founder of major British multinational company Marks &amp; Spencer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Marks was born in the Leylands, Leeds, on 9 July 1888, son of Michael Marks and Hannah Cohen, and educated at Manchester Grammar School.

===Career===
In 1907, he inherited a number of &quot;penny bazaars&quot; from his father, which had been established with Thomas Spencer. With the help of Israel Sieff, he built Marks &amp; Spencer into an icon of British business.

He was knighted on 4 July 1944 and on 10 July 1961 was raised to the peerage as Baron Marks of Broughton, &quot;of Sunningdale in the Royal County of Berkshire&quot;.

===Death and legacy===

Marks died 8 December 1964, in London, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His ashes and memorial are housed within the internal columbarium (visible by arrangement). The ashes of his wife Miriam Marks (née Sieff, sister of Israel Sieff), and those of his business partner Israel Sieff, rest with his.

He was succeeded in the barony by his only son, Michael Marks, 2nd Baron Marks of Broughton, who died in 1998 and was succeeded in the title by his own son, Simon Marks, 3rd Baron Marks of Broughton.

<text>Victor Frederick Buckingham (23 October 1915 – 26 January 1995) was an English football player and manager.

He played for Second Division side Tottenham Hotspur. As manager he won the 1954 FA Cup final with West Bromwich Albion and finished runners-up in the First Division. He had two periods as manager of Ajax, leading the side to the Dutch Championship of 1960. In 1964, Johan Cruyff made his league debut under him.

In 1971, Buckingham&#x27;s Barcelona side finished as league runners-up and won the Spanish Cup. He also held manager positions with Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday and in Greece. Buckingham is considered to have been a pioneer of the footballing philosophy known as Total Football, later further developed by his protégé Johan Cruyff.

== Career ==
Buckingham joined Tottenham Hotspur in 1934 and played the first season (1934–35) for Tottenham Hotspur nursery club Northfleet United. After that single season he returned to Tottenham, then playing in the Second Division, where he accumulated 230 matches as a defensive midfielder and later defender before leaving in 1949.

He started his managerial career at Oxford University 1949–50. After this, he headed the joint amateur team of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, Pegasus, with which he won in 1951 the FA Amateur Cup, defeating Bishop Auckland in the final 2–1 in front of a crowd of 100,000 at Wembley Stadium, playing an &quot;attractive push-and-run style of football where they worked hard for one another, kept it simple and passed the ball quickly&quot;.

Between 1951 and 1953, he managed Bradford Park Avenue, then playing in the Third Division North of the Football, reaching upper midtable places.

In 1953, he was hired at West Bromwich Albion as successor to Jesse Carver, who returned to Italy. He became the club&#x27;s longest-serving post-war manager, almost leading them to the &quot;double&quot; in 1954 when they won the FA Cup, defeating Preston North End 3–2, and finished second in the league.

In 1959, he became manager of Ajax, succeeding the Austrian Karl Humenberger in the dugout. There he won the 1959–60 Eredivisie. For personal reasons he left the club at the end of May 1960, a couple of weeks before the end of the 1960–61 season. With the only 28-year-old Keith Spurgeon, who was recommended to Ajax by the English FA, another Englishman, the sixth in the history of the club, became &quot;trainer&quot; of Ajax. He would stay until the end of the following season.

Initially, it was rumored Buckingham might join Plymouth Argyle, but he ended up at Sheffield Wednesday, runners-up in the 1960–61 First Division, where he replaced Harry Catterick, who was lured to Everton two games before the end of the season. Under Buckingham&#x27;s management, Sheffield Wednesday finished in sixth place in three consecutive seasons. On 9 April 1964, he was sacked from his £3,000 a year job with the club. Jack Mansell, who was suspended by Buckingham from the first team&#x27;s coaching staff, replaced him as caretaker manager.

Buckingham was never thought to be personally involved in the British betting scandal of 1964, which was revealed on 12 April 1964, however the club management alleged in the aftermath, that lax discipline under him may have played a role. Three of his players at Wednesday – Peter Swan, Tony Kay and David Layne – were accused of taking bribes to fix a match with Ipswich Town on 1 December 1962 and betting on their team to lose, which then lost 2–0.

For the 1964–65 season he returned to Ajax. This time, the only success was the league debut of the 17-year-old Johan Cruijff in November. Poor results, including a 9–4 defeat in Rotterdam to Feijenoord, saw Ajax just three points above the relegation zone. By January 1965, Buckingham had left the club. In Amsterdam, this was the beginning of the era of Rinus Michels.

In later years, Johan Cruijff would speak about Vic Buckingham and Keith Spurgeon:
&quot;They were open-minded but, tactically, you have to see where we were at that time. Football in Holland then was good but it was not really professional. They gave us some professionalism because they were much further down the road. But the tactical thinking came later with Michels. It started then.&quot;
Back in England, Buckingham joined First Division side Fulham in January 1965. The club was struggling at the time and were later relegated in 1968. It is said that the purchase of Allan Clarke from Walsall was one of his best decisions in that time. With 45 goals in 86 matches until 1968, Clarke contributed to the club staying up as long as it did and after relegation he was sold for £150,000, then the record British transfer fee.

After a brief stint in Greece, he was hired in 1969 by Barcelona in Spain. There, he won the Spanish Cup, the Copa del Generalísimo of 1970–71, in a 4–3 win after extra time against Valencia in the final. In the same season, Barcelona were runner up in the league, behind Valencia. They were equal on points, but Valencia prevailed due to the results of the matches against each other: Barça lost 2–0 at home and drew 1–1 away. After this season, it was once more that Rinus Michels replaced him. Amongst the stars of this Barcelona side were Joaquim Rifé, Carles Rexach, Josep Maria Fusté and Juan Manuel Asensi.

In February 1972, he joined Sevilla, but was unable to avoid relegation with the club. Thereafter, he had two more engagements in Greece. When he was hired by Greek champions Olympiacos in 1975, he finished the season to 1976 in third place and did not gain an extension to his contract. His last job was with Rodos, another Greek First Division side, where he joined at the beginning of the 1979–80 season. The team was relegated at the end of the season.

==Personal life==
Buckingham was born in Greenwich, the son of Annie Elizabeth Jenkins and William George Buckingham. He was married to Lilian Emma King and had three children. He died aged 79 in Chichester, England.

<text>The President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board (PIAB) is an advisory body to the Executive Office of the President of the United States. According to its self-description, it &quot;provides advice to the President concerning the quality and adequacy of intelligence collection, of analysis and estimates, of counterintelligence, and of other intelligence activities.&quot;

The PIAB, through its Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB), also advises the President on the legality of foreign intelligence activities.

== History ==
In January 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the agency, originally known as the President&#x27;s Board of Consultants on Foreign Intelligence Activities (PBCFIA). The first board, under chair James Killian, included the following members:

*Richard Conolly
*Jimmy Doolittle
*Benjamin Fairless
*John Hull
*Joseph P. Kennedy
*Robert Lovett
*Edward Ryerson

In May 1961, President John F. Kennedy renamed it to the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB).

The board exists at the pleasure of the President, who can change its size and portfolio so in 1977 President Jimmy Carter abolished the PFIAB, but President Ronald Reagan re-established it later.

On 29 February 2008, President George W. Bush renamed the agency to President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board, its present form.

Most of the board&#x27;s work is classified, but one public investigation involved the loss of U.S. nuclear secrets to China from the Los Alamos National Laboratory during the 1990s.

===Intelligence Oversight Board===
President Gerald Ford created the IOB following a 1975–76 investigation by the US Congress into domestic spying, assassination operations, and other abuses by intelligence agencies. His executive order doing so went into effect on 1 March 1976. In 1993, the IOB became a committee of the PFIAB, under Executive Order #12863 of President Bill Clinton.

One of the IOB&#x27;s functions is to examine violations of the laws and directives governing clandestine surveillance. The IOB received quarterly and annual reports from most US intelligence activities. Thirteen cases involving FBI actions between 2002 and 2004 were referred to the IOB for its review.

In an executive order issued on February 29, 2008, President George W. Bush terminated the IOB&#x27;s authority to oversee the general counsel and inspector general of each U.S. intelligence agency, and erased the requirement that each inspector general file a report with the IOB every three months. The order also removed the IOB&#x27;s authority to refer a matter to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation, and directed the IOB to notify the president of a problem only if other officials are not already &quot;adequately&quot; addressing that problem.

In August 2013 it was reported that the membership of the IOB had been reduced from 14 to 4 under President Barack Obama, possibly starting in early May at the beginning of the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures by Edward Snowden.

== Membership ==

During the administration of President George W. Bush, the PIAB had 16 members selected from among distinguished citizens outside the government who were qualified &quot;on the basis of achievement, experience, independence, and integrity.&quot; The members were not paid.

PIAB membership is generally considered public information; for example, the Clinton Administration posted the names of the members on a PFIAB web page, and the Trump Administration issued a press release announcing the nominations of new members.

===George W. Bush===
In August 2002, Randy Deitering, the executive director of PFIAB, confirmed the membership list released by the White House press office in October 2001:
*Brent Scowcroft, the chair
*Pete Wilson, former governor of California
*Cresencio S. Arcos Jr., AT&amp;T executive and former US ambassador
*Jim Barksdale, former head of the internet company Netscape
*Robert Addison Day, chairman of the TWC Group, a money management firm
*Stephen Friedman, past chairman of Goldman Sachs
*Alfred Lerner, chief executive of MBNA
*Ray Lee Hunt, scion of the Texas oil fortune
*Rita Hauser, lawyer
*David E. Jeremiah, retired admiral
*Arnold Kanter, national security official in the George H. W. Bush administration and a founding member of the Scowcroft Group
*James C. Langdon Jr., a power-lawyer in Texas
*Elisabeth Pate-Cornell, chair of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University
*John Harrison Streicker, real estate magnate
*Philip Zelikow, National Security Council staffer during the George H.W. Bush administration and later a counselor to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice

In 2003, there were indications of spying on members of the board by a foreign intelligence asset.

===Barack Obama===
The entire PIAB membership that served under the administration of George W. Bush resigned as part of an agreed-upon move in the presidential transition of Barack Obama.

<doc id="674529" wikidata="Q1128595" url="?curid=674529" title="Pulmonary hypertension">
<text>Pulmonary hypertension (PH or PHTN) is a condition of increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fainting, tiredness, chest pain, swelling of the legs, and a fast heartbeat. The condition may make it difficult to exercise. Onset is typically gradual.

According to the definition at the 6th World Symposium of Pulmonary Hypertension in 2018, a patient is deemed to have pulmonary hypertension if the pulmonary mean arterial pressure is greater than 20mmHg at rest, revised down from a purely arbitrary 25mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) greater than 3 Wood units.
The cause is often unknown. Risk factors include a family history, prior pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs), HIV/AIDS, sickle cell disease, cocaine use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sleep apnea, living at high altitudes, and problems with the mitral valve. The underlying mechanism typically involves inflammation and subsequent remodeling of the arteries in the lungs. Diagnosis involves first ruling out other potential causes.
 there was no cure for pulmonary hypertension, although research to find a cure is ongoing. Treatment depends on the type of disease. A number of supportive measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit blood clotting may be used. Medications specifically used to treat pulmonary hypertension include epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil, tadalafil, selexipag, riociguat. Lung transplantation may be an option in severe cases.
The frequency of occurrence is estimated at 1,000 new cases per year in the United States. Females are more often affected than males. Onset is typically between 20 and 60 years of age. Pulmonary hypertension was identified by Ernst von Romberg in 1891.
==Classification==
According to WHO classification there are 5 groups of PH, where Group I (pulmonary arterial hypertension) is further subdivided into Group I&#x27; and Group I&quot; classes. The WHO classification system in 2022 (with adaptations from the more recent ESC/ERS guidelines shown in italics) can be summarized as follows:

WHO Group I – Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

==Signs and symptoms==
The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension include the following:
Less common signs/symptoms include non-productive cough and exercise-induced nausea and vomiting. Coughing up of blood may occur in some patients, particularly those with specific subtypes of pulmonary hypertension such as heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension, Eisenmenger syndrome and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping (orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), while pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) typically does not.

Other typical signs of pulmonary hypertension include an accentuated pulmonary component of the second heart sound, a right ventricular third heart sound, and parasternal heave indicating a hypertrophied right ventricle. Signs of systemic congestion resulting from right-sided heart failure include jugular venous distension, ascites, and hepatojugular reflux. Evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and pulmonic regurgitation is also sought and, if present, is consistent with the presence of pulmonary hypertension.

==Causes==
Pulmonary hypertension is a pathophysiologic condition with many possible causes. Indeed, this condition frequently accompanies severe heart or lung conditions. A 1973 World Health Organization meeting was the first attempt to classify pulmonary hypertension by its cause, and a distinction was made between primary PH (resulting from a disease of the pulmonary arteries) and secondary PH (resulting secondary to other, non-vascular causes). Further, primary PH was divided into the &quot;arterial plexiform&quot;, &quot;veno-occlusive&quot; and &quot;thromboembolic&quot; forms. In 1998, a second conference at Évian-les-Bains addressed the causes of secondary PH. Subsequent third, fourth, and fifth (2013) World Symposia on PAH have further defined the classification of PH. The classification continues to evolve based on improved understanding of the disease mechanisms.

Most recently in 2022, the WHO guidelines were updated by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and European Respiratory Society (ERS). These guidelines are endorsed by the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, and provide the current framework for understanding and treatment of pulmonary hypertension.

===Genetics===

Mutations in several genes have been associated with this condition these include bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 gene (EIF2AK4). 80% of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension and 20% of sporadic variants have mutations in BMPR2. BMPR2 is involved in endothelial proliferation and remodeling. Other mutations associated with PAH include ACVRL1 (which encodes activin receptor–like kinase 1) and ENG encoding endoglin, two proteins which also participate in BMPR2 signaling. The SMAD transcription factor family, including SMAD1, SMAD4, and SMAD9 are involved in signaling pathways downstream from BMPR2 and are also implicated in the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

==Pathogenesis==
The pathogenesis of pulmonary &quot;arterial&quot; hypertension (WHO Group I) involves the narrowing of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood through the lungs, as it is much harder to make water flow through a narrow pipe as opposed to a wide one. Over time, the affected blood vessels become stiffer and thicker, in a process known as fibrosis. The mechanisms involved in this narrowing process include vasoconstriction, thrombosis, and vascular remodeling (excessive cellular proliferation, fibrosis, and reduced apoptosis/programmed cell death in the vessel walls, caused by inflammation, disordered metabolism and dysregulation of certain growth factors). This further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow. In common with other types of pulmonary hypertension, these changes result in an increased workload for the right side of the heart. The right ventricle is normally part of a low pressure system, with systolic ventricular pressures that are lower than those that the left ventricle normally encounters. As such, the right ventricle cannot cope as well with higher pressures, and although right ventricular adaptations (hypertrophy and increased contractility of the heart muscle) initially help to preserve stroke volume, ultimately these compensatory mechanisms are insufficient; the right ventricular muscle cannot get enough oxygen to meet its needs and right heart failure follows. As the blood flowing through the lungs decreases, the left side of the heart receives less blood. This blood may also carry less oxygen than normal. Therefore, it becomes harder and harder for the left side of the heart to supply sufficient oxygen to the rest of the body, especially during physical activity. During the end-systolic volume phase of the cardiac cycle, the Gaussian curvature and the mean curvature of right ventricular endocardial wall of PH patients was found to be significantly different as compared to controls.

In PVOD (WHO Group I&#x27;), pulmonary blood vessel narrowing occurs preferentially (though not exclusively) in post-capillary venous blood vessels. PVOD shares several characteristics with PAH, but there are also some important differences, for example differences in prognosis and response to medical therapy.

Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn occurs when the circulatory system of a newborn baby fails to adapt to life outside the womb; it is characterized by high resistance to blood flow through the lungs, right-to-left cardiac shunting and severe hypoxemia.

Pathogenesis in pulmonary hypertension due to left heart disease (WHO Group II) is completely different in that constriction or damage to the pulmonary blood vessels is not the issue. Instead, the left heart fails to pump blood efficiently, leading to pooling of blood in the lungs and back pressure within the pulmonary system. This causes pulmonary edema and pleural effusions. In the absence of pulmonary blood vessel narrowing, the increased back pressure is described as &#x27;isolated post-capillary pulmonary hypertension&#x27; (older terms include &#x27;passive&#x27; or &#x27;proportionate&#x27; pulmonary hypertension or &#x27;pulmonary venous hypertension&#x27;). However, in some patients, the raised pressure in the pulmonary vessels triggers a superimposed component of vessel narrowing, which further increases the workload of the right side of the heart. This is referred to as &#x27;post-capillary pulmonary hypertension with a pre-capillary component&#x27; or &#x27;combined post-capillary and pre-capillary pulmonary hypertension&#x27; (older terms include &#x27;reactive&#x27; or &#x27;out-of-proportion&#x27; pulmonary hypertension).

In pulmonary hypertension due to lung diseases and/or hypoxia (WHO Group III), low levels of oxygen in the alveoli (due to respiratory disease or living at high altitude) cause constriction of the pulmonary arteries. This phenomenon is called hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and it is initially a protective response to stop too much blood flowing to areas of the lung that are damaged and do not contain oxygen. When the alveolar hypoxia is widespread and prolonged, this hypoxia-mediated vasoconstriction occurs across a large portion of the pulmonary vascular bed and leads to an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, with thickening of the pulmonary vessel walls contributing to the development of sustained pulmonary hypertension. Prolonged hypoxia also induces the transcription factor HIF1A, which directly activates downstream growth factor signaling that causes irreversible proliferation and remodeling of pulmonary arterial endothelial cells, leading to chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

In chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, or CTEPH (WHO Group IV), the initiating event is thought to be blockage or narrowing of the pulmonary blood vessels with unresolved blood clots; these clots can lead to increased pressure and shear stress in the rest of the pulmonary circulation, precipitating structural changes in the vessel walls (remodeling) similar to those observed in other types of severe pulmonary hypertension. This combination of vessel occlusion and vascular remodeling once again increases the resistance to blood flow and so the pressure within the system rises.

===Molecular pathology===

The molecular mechanism of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is not known yet, but it is believed that the endothelial dysfunction results in a decrease in the synthesis of endothelium-derived vasodilators such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Moreover, there is a stimulation of the synthesis of vasoconstrictors such as thromboxane and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These result in a severe vasoconstriction and vascular smooth muscle and adventitial hypertrophy characteristic of patients with PAH.

====Nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase pathway====
In normal conditions, the vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide from L-arginine in the presence of oxygen.

This nitric oxide diffuses into neighboring cells (including vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets), where it increases the activity of the enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to increased formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent kinase or PKG (protein kinase G). Activated PKG promotes vasorelaxation (via a reduction of intracellular calcium levels), alters the expression of genes involved in smooth muscle cell contraction, migration and differentiation, and inhibits platelet activation. Nitric oxide–soluble guanylate cyclase signaling also leads to anti-inflammatory effects.

Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is abundant in the pulmonary tissue, hydrolyzes the cyclic bond of cGMP. Consequently, the concentration of cGMP (and thus PKG activity) decreases.

====Endothelin====

Endothelin-1 is a peptide (comprising 21 amino acids) that is produced in endothelial cells. It acts on the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB in various cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, leading to vasoconstriction, hypertrophy, proliferation, inflammation, and fibrosis. It also acts on ETB receptors in endothelial cells; this leads to the release of both vasoconstrictors and vasodilators from those cells, and clears endothelin-1 from the system.

====Prostacyclin and thromboxane====

Prostacyclin is synthesized from arachidonic acid in endothelial cells. In vascular smooth muscle cells, prostacyclin binds mainly to the prostaglandin I receptor. This sends a signal to increase adenylate cyclase activity, which leads to increased synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This in turn leads to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase or PKA (protein kinase A) activity, ultimately promoting vasodilation and inhibiting cell proliferation. Prostacyclin signaling also leads to anti-thrombotic, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Levels of cAMP (which mediates most of the biological effects of prostacyclin) are reduced by phosphodiesterases 3 and 4.
The vasoconstrictor thromboxane is also synthesized from arachidonic acid. In PAH, the balance is shifted away from synthesis of prostacyclin toward synthesis of thromboxane.

====Other pathways====

The three pathways described above are all targeted by currently available medical therapies for PAH. However, several other pathways have been identified that are also altered in PAH and are being investigated as potential targets for future therapies. For example, the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is pathologically activated in PAH, causing a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and leading to increased cell proliferation and impaired apoptosis. Expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide, a potent vasodilator with anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory roles, is reduced in PAH, while expression of its receptor is increased.
Plasma levels of serotonin, which promotes vasoconstriction, hypertrophy and proliferation, are increased in patients with PAH, although the role played by serotonin in the pathogenesis of PAH remains uncertain. The expression or activity of several growth factors (including platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor) is increased and contributes to vascular remodeling in PAH. Other factors underlying the proliferative state of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells include OPG and TRAIL. Focusing only on the pulmonary vasculature provides an incomplete picture of PAH; the ability of the right ventricle to adapt to the increased workload varies between patients and is an important determinant of survival. The molecular pathology of PAH in the right ventricle is therefore also being investigated, and recent research has shifted to consider the cardiopulmonary unit as a single system rather than two separate systems. Importantly, right ventricular remodeling is associated with increased apoptosis; this is in contrast to pulmonary vascular remodeling which involves inhibition of apoptosis.

Even though the primary cause of PAH is unknown, inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to have a key role in vascular remodeling. These factors are known to cause DNA damage, and may also promote the proliferative and apoptosis-resistant phenotype that is observed in PAH vascular cells. Elevated levels of DNA damage have been reported to occur in PAH lungs and remodeled arteries, and also in animal models of PH, indicating that DNA damage likely contributes to PAH pathogenesis.

==Diagnosis==
In terms of the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, it has five major types, and a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or unclear multifactorial varieties. PAH is diagnosed after exclusion of other possible causes of pulmonary hypertension.

===Physical examination===
A physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension (described above), and a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be heritable. A history of exposure to drugs such as benfluorex (a fenfluramine derivative), dasatinib, cocaine, methamphetamine, ethanol leading to cirrhosis, and tobacco leading to emphysema is considered significant. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy (particularly late pregnancy) is associated with an increased risk of the baby developing persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

===Echocardiography===
If pulmonary hypertension is suspected based on the above assessments, echocardiography is performed as the next step. A meta-analysis of Doppler echocardiography for predicting the results of right heart catheterization reported a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 56%, respectively. Thus, Doppler echocardiography can suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension, but right heart catheterization (described below) remains the gold standard for diagnosis of PAH.
Echocardiography can also help to detect congenital heart disease as a cause of pulmonary hypertension.

===Exclude other diseases===
If the echocardiogram is compatible with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, common causes of pulmonary hypertension (left heart disease and lung disease) are considered and further tests are performed accordingly. These tests generally include electrocardiography (ECG), pulmonary function tests including lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and arterial blood gas measurements, X-rays of the chest and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning.

==== Ventilation/perfusion scintigraphy ====
If heart disease and lung disease have been excluded, a ventilation/perfusion scan is performed to rule out CTEPH. If unmatched perfusion defects are found, further evaluation by CT pulmonary angiography, right heart catheterization, and selective pulmonary angiography is performed.

===CT scan===

Signs of pulmonary hypertension on CT scan of the chest are:
* Enlargement of the pulmonary trunk (measured at its bifurcation). It is, however, a poor predictor of pulmonary hypertension in patients with interstitial lung disease.
:*A diameter of more than 27 mm for women and 29 mm for men is suggested as a cutoff.
:*A cutoff of 31.6 mm may be a more statistically robust in individuals without interstitial lung disease.
* Increased ratio of the diameter of the main pulmonary artery (pulmonary trunk) to the ascending aorta (measured at its bifurcation).
:*A ratio of 1.0 is suggested as a cutoff in adults.
:*Cutoff ~1.09 in children.
* Increased diameter ratio of segmental arteries to bronchi. This finding in three or four lobes, in the presence of a dilated pulmonary trunk (≥29 mm), and absence of significant structural lung disease confers a specificity of 100% for pulmonary hypertension.
* Mural calcification in central pulmonary arteries is most frequently seen in patients with Eisenmenger&#x27;s syndrome.

===Right heart catheterization===
Although pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) can be estimated on the basis of echocardiography, pressure measurements with a Swan-Ganz catheter inserted through the right side of the heart provide the most definite assessment.[42] Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean PAP of at least 20 mm Hg (3300 Pa) at rest, and PAH is defined as precapillary pulmonary hypertension (i.e. mean PAP ≥ 20 mm Hg with pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure [PAOP] ≤ 15 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR] &gt; 3 Wood Units). PAOP and PVR cannot be measured directly with echocardiography. Therefore, diagnosis of PAH requires right-sided cardiac catheterization. A Swan-Ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output; this can be used to calculate the cardiac index, which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure.
&quot;Mean&quot; PAP (mPAP) should not be confused with systolic PAP (sPAP), which is often reported on echocardiogram reports. A systolic pressure of 40 mm Hg typically implies a mean pressure of more than 25 mm Hg. Roughly, mPAP = 0.61•sPAP + 2. Due to the invasive nature of this procedure, the use of computational fluid dynamics based hemodynamic indices have been postulated.

===Other===
For people considered likely to have PAH based on the above tests, the specific associated condition is then determined based on the physical examination, medical/family history and further specific diagnostic tests (for example, serological tests to detect underlying connective tissue disease, HIV infection or hepatitis, ultrasonography to confirm the presence of portal hypertension, echocardiography/cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for congenital heart disease, laboratory tests for schistosomiasis, and high-resolution CT for PVOD and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis). Routine lung biopsy is discouraged in patients with PAH, because of the risk to the patient and because the findings are unlikely to alter the diagnosis and treatment.

==Treatment==
Treatment of pulmonary hypertension is determined by whether the PH is arterial, venous, hypoxic, thromboembolic, or miscellaneous. If it is caused by left heart disease, the treatment is to optimize left ventricular function by the use of medication or to repair/replace the mitral valve or aortic valve. Patients with left heart failure or hypoxemic lung diseases (groups II or III pulmonary hypertension) should not routinely be treated with vasoactive agents including prostanoids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, or endothelin antagonists, as these are approved for the different condition called primary pulmonary arterial hypertension. To make the distinction, doctors at a minimum will conduct cardiac catheterization of the right heart, echocardiography, chest CT, a seven-minute walk test, and pulmonary function testing. Using treatments for other kinds of pulmonary hypertension in patients with these conditions can harm the patient and wastes substantial medical resources.

High-dose calcium channel blockers are useful in only 5% of IPAH patients who are &quot;vasoreactive&quot; by Swan-Ganz catheter. Calcium channel blockers have been largely misused, being prescribed to many patients with non-vasoreactive PAH, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. The criteria for vasoreactivity have changed. Only those patients whose &quot;mean&quot; pulmonary artery pressure falls by more than 10 mm Hg to less than 40 mm Hg with an unchanged or increased cardiac output when challenged with adenosine, epoprostenol, or nitric oxide are considered vasoreactive. Of these, only half of the patients are responsive to calcium channel blockers in the long term.

A number of agents have recently been introduced for primary and secondary PAH. The trials supporting the use of these agents have been relatively small, and the only measure consistently used to compare their effectivity is the &quot;six-minute walk test&quot;. Many have no data on mortality benefit or time to progression.

Sotatercept (Winrevair) was approved for medical use in the United States in March 2024. Keros Therapeutics has decided to end a mid-stage trial of its experimental treatment, cibotercept, after identifying safety concerns, including fluid buildup around the heart in patients with PAH. Keros had aimed to compete with Merck’s FDA-approved PAH drug, Sotatercept. 

Exercise-based rehabilitation

A 2023 Cochrane review found that exercise-based rehabilitation may lead to a large increase in exercise capacity and an improvement in health related quality of life, without significantly increasing adverse events.

===Vasoactive substances===
Many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs – endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, and prostacyclin derivatives.

====Prostaglandins====
Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is commonly considered the most effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore has to be kept on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.

====Endothelin receptor antagonists====
Moderate quality evidence suggests that endothelin receptor antagonists improve exercise capacity and decrease symptoms severity. The dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan was approved in 2001. Macitentan is another ETA and ETB dual endothelin receptor blocker that is used. Sitaxentan (Thelin) was approved for use in Canada, Australia, and the European Union, but not in the United States. In 2010, Pfizer withdrew sitaxentan worldwide because of fatal liver complications. A similar drug, ambrisentan (which is a ETA endothelin receptor blocker) is sold under the brand name Letairis in the US by Gilead Sciences.

====Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors====
The US FDA approved sildenafil, a selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), for the treatment of PAH in 2005. It is marketed for PAH as Revatio. In 2009, they also approved tadalafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, marketed under the name Adcirca. PDE5 inhibitors are believed to increase pulmonary artery vasodilation, and inhibit vascular remodeling, thus lowering pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance.

Tadalafil is taken orally, as well as sildenafil, and it is rapidly absorbed (serum levels are detectable at 20 minutes). The T1/2 (biological half-life) hovers around 17.5 hours in healthy subjects. Moreover, if we consider pharmacoeconomic implications, patients that take tadalafil would pay two-thirds of the cost of sildenafil therapy. However, there are some adverse effects of this drug such as headache, diarrhea, nausea, back pain, dyspepsia, flushing and myalgia.

The combination medication macitentan/tadalafil (Opsynvi) was approved for medical use in Canada in October 2021, and in the United States in March 2024.

====Activators of soluble guanylate cyclase====
Soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is the intracellular receptor for NO. , the sGC activators cinaciguat and riociguat were undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of PAH.

===Surgical===
Atrial septostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a communication between the right and left atria. It relieves pressure on the right side of the heart, but at the cost of lower oxygen levels in blood (hypoxemia). Lung transplantation replaces a chronic condition with the ongoing need for treatment. There is a post-surgical median survival of just over five years.

Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy (PTE) is a surgical procedure that is used for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. It is the surgical removal of an organized thrombus (clot) along with the lining of the pulmonary artery; it is a very difficult, major procedure that is currently performed in a few select centers.

===Monitoring===
Established clinical practice guidelines dictate the frequency of pulmonary nodule evaluation and surveillance,
patients are normally monitored through commonly available tests such as:
==Prognosis==

PAH is considered a universally fatal illness, although survival time may vary between individuals. The prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I) has an &quot;untreated&quot; median survival of 2–3 years from time of diagnosis, with the cause of death usually being right ventricular failure (cor pulmonale). The survival time is variable and depends on many factors. A recent outcome study of those patients who had started treatment with bosentan (Tracleer) showed that 89% of patients were alive at 2 years. With new therapies, survival rates are increasing. For 2,635 patients enrolled in The Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-term Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease Management (REVEAL Registry) from March 2006 to December 2009, 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates were 85%, 68%, 57%, and 49%, respectively. For patients with idiopathic/familial PAH, survival rates were 91%, 74%, 65%, and 59%. Levels of mortality are very high in pregnant women with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO Group I). Pregnancy is sometimes described as contraindicated in these women.

==Epidemiology==
The epidemiology of IPAH is about 125–150 deaths per year in the U.S., and worldwide the incidence is similar at 4 cases per million. However, in parts of Europe (France), indications are 6 cases per million of IPAH. Females have a higher incidence rate than males (2–9:1).
Other forms of PH are far more common. In systemic scleroderma, the incidence has been estimated to be 8 to 12% of all patients; in rheumatoid arthritis it is rare. However, in systemic lupus erythematosus it is 4 to 14%, and in sickle cell disease, it ranges from 20 to 40%. Up to 4% of people who develop a pulmonary embolism go on to develop chronic thromboembolic disease including pulmonary hypertension. A small percentage of patients with COPD develop pulmonary hypertension with no other disease to explain the high pressure. On the other hand, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome is very commonly associated with right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension.

==Research==
For people that inherited the disease, gene therapy is being studied.

<text>Mark David Quinn (born May 21, 1974) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder and right-handed batter who played for the Kansas City Royals and former coach for the Baltimore Orioles. Quinn was drafted in the 11th round of the 1995 Amateur Draft after playing two seasons for the Rice University Owls. He played for the Royals between 1999–2002. He retired for good in 2007 after spring training with the Yomiuri Giants.

==Career==
In 1998, Quinn led the Texas League in batting average when he hit .349 for the Wichita Wranglers. He captured a second minor league batting crown the following year, posting a .360 average for the Omaha Golden Spikes of the Pacific Coast League.

On September 14, 1999, Quinn made his major league debut and became just the third player in MLB history to hit two home runs in his major league debut, joining Bob Nieman (1951) and Bert Campaneris (1964). In 17 games in September, Quinn hit .333 with 6 home runs and 18 RBIs.

In , Quinn became the Royals regular leftfielder. 
He hit .294 with 20 home runs and 78 RBIs in 135 games, earning him the &quot;Sporting News&quot; American League Rookie Player of the Year and a spot on the 2000 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. Quinn finished 3rd in AL Rookie of the Year voting, behind Kazuhiro Sasaki and Terrence Long, garnering four first-place votes.

Quinn split the season between right field, left field, and designated hitter. His production at the plate dropped to 17 homers and a .269 average due to nagging hamstring injuries.

The 2002 campaign was plagued by injuries that forced Quinn to spend 156 total days on the injured list that season. He appeared in just 23 games in the major leagues, hitting .237 with 2 home runs and 11 RBIs.

During Spring Training, Quinn was released by the Royals after going just 1-for-8 in his appearances and suffering another setback with his hamstring.

In four seasons with the Royals, Quinn batted .282 with 45 home runs, 167 RBI, 153 runs, 72 doubles, five triples, and 17 stolen bases in 293 games.

Following his release, Quinn played in the San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, St. Louis Cardinals, and Chicago White Sox organizations, along with a stint with the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League, but was never able to return to the major leagues.

==Coaching==
Mark Quinn owns The Baseball School in Houston, Tx, and coaches the Houston Royals select teams.

On January 6, 2016 Quinn was hired to become the assistant hitting coach for the Baltimore Orioles.

<doc id="674536" wikidata="Q1800594" url="?curid=674536" title="North/South Ministerial Council">
<text>The North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) (, Ulster-Scots: ) is a body established under the Good Friday Agreement to co-ordinate activity and exercise certain governmental powers across the whole island of Ireland.

The Council takes the form of meetings between ministers from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and is responsible for twelve policy areas. Six of these areas are the responsibility of corresponding North/South Implementation Bodies. The body is based in the city of Armagh in Northern Ireland.

The North/South Ministerial Council and the Northern Ireland Assembly are &quot;mutually inter-dependent&quot; institutions: one cannot exist without the other. When the Northern Ireland Assembly is suspended, responsibility for areas of co-operation fall to the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.

==Organisation==

The Ministerial Council consists of representatives of both the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland. The Ministerial Council may meet in either a plenary or, more commonly, sectoral format. In a plenary meeting a Northern Ireland delegation is led by the First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland while the Republic&#x27;s delegation is led by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste.

A meeting in a sectoral format deals only with one particular policy area, and consists of the minister from Dublin with responsibility for the area under discussion, and two ministers from Northern Ireland (usually one unionist and one nationalist), including the minister with the relevant competence. The council is supported by a standing joint secretariat, consisting of members of the civil services of both Northern Ireland and the Republic.

The council also has occasional meetings in an &quot;institutional&quot; format to consider other business and technical matters, such as appointments to boards.

==Areas for co-operation==

The council is responsible for twelve &quot;areas for co-operation&quot;. Six of these are in areas where co-operation must be agreed together but implemented separately in each jurisdiction. Six more are in areas where co-operation is agreed together and implemented through shared all-Ireland &quot;implementation bodies&quot;.

Areas for co-operation where implementation is carried out separately:

* Agriculture: Common Agricultural Policy issues, animal and plant health, agricultural research and rural development.
* Education: Education for children with special needs, educational under-achievement, teacher qualifications and school, youth and teacher exchanges.
* Environment: Environmental protection, pollution, water-quality management and waste management.
* Health: Accident and emergency planning, co-operation on high-technology equipment, cancer research and health promotion.
* Tourism: The promotion of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination for overseas visitors via the establishment of a new company, known as Tourism Ireland.
* Transport: Co-operation on strategic transport planning including road and rail infrastructure and public transport services and road and rail safety.

The six all-Ireland implementation bodies are:

* Waterways Ireland: Management of specific and chiefly recreational inland waterways.
* Food Safety Promotion Board: Food safety awareness.
* Special European Union Programmes Body: Management and oversight of EU programmes and common chapters of the National Development Plan (Ireland) and the Northern Ireland Structural Funds Plan.
* The North/South Language Body: Promotion of the Irish and Ulster Scots languages through two separate agencies, Foras na Gaeilge (Irish) and Tha Boord o Ulstèr-Scotch (Ulster Scots).
* Inter&quot;Trade&quot;Ireland: all-Ireland trade and business development.
* Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission: The management and development of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough and coastal lights through two separate agencies, The Loughs Agency and Lights Agency

Additional areas for co-operation may be added by agreement among the council and with the endorsement of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Oireachtas.

Originally, a new jointly owned agency, Lights Agency, was intended to replace the Commissioners of Irish Lights, which is funded from the UK Department for Transport-managed General Lighthouse Fund to provide coastal aids to navigation throughout the island of Ireland. However, complexities arising from the transfer of functions have meant that this has had to be reconsidered.

==Operation==

Twenty-one plenary meetings were held between 1999 and 2015: one each year from 1999 to 2002, and 2007 to 2008; and on average two each year thereafter. Meetings alternate between north and south, usually in Armagh and Dublin. Sectoral meetings occur more frequently at various locations.

The level of co-operation differs across areas. For example, co-operation on tourism proceeded very rapidly (creating Tourism Ireland in 2000). On the other hand, there was initially little co-operation in the area of transport. At first because of resistance from the relevant minister in Northern Ireland and later because, after the restoration of the Council following suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, because the British and Irish governments had already done much of the work during a period of direct rule.

In 2007, the joint secretariat number 25 personnel, comprising 10 from Ireland and 15 from Northern Ireland. In 2010, the secretariat took up new, permanent office in Armagh. Budgets, staff numbers and headquarters for the six implementation bodies (including Tourism Ireland) in 2008 were as follows:

<text>The most northern settlements on Earth are communities close to the North Pole, ranging from about 70° N to about 89° N. The North Pole itself is at 90° N.

There are no permanent civilian settlements north of 79° N, the furthest north (78.55° N) being Ny-Ålesund, a permanent settlement of about 30 (in the winter) to 130 (in the summer) people on the Norwegian island of Svalbard. Just below this settlement at 78.12° N is Svalbard&#x27;s primary city, Longyearbyen, which has a population of over 2,000.

When occupied for a few weeks some years, the northernmost temporary settlement in the world is Camp Barneo, a Russian tourist attraction located near 88°11&#x27;00&quot; N. As of 2022, it had not been occupied since 2018.

<text>Robert Barry Moore (born April 3, 1943) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. The left-hander was signed by the Washington Senators as an amateur free agent before the 1962 season and played for the Senators (1965–1969), Cleveland Indians (1970) and Chicago White Sox (1970).

==Career==
Moore led the Eastern League with 155 bases on balls (in 165 innings) while playing for the York White Roses in 1964.

Moore made his major league debut in relief on May 29, 1965 against the Minnesota Twins. He entered the game in the top of the 9th with the Senators behind, 10-7, and gave up one unearned run in his one inning of work. Washington scored a run in the bottom of the inning, and the game ended, 11-8. He earned his first big league win on July 23, 1966 by pitching a three-hit complete game against the Kansas City Athletics in front of a home crowd of only 2,777. The score was 8-1.

His finest major league effort was against the Twins on April 30, 1967 (Game # 2). He pitched a one-hit complete game shutout at D.C. Stadium that day, walking only two batters. The Twins had such players as César Tovar, Rod Carew, Harmon Killebrew, Bob Allison, and Zoilo Versalles in the lineup, but Moore was almost untouchable. Tovar got the only Minnesota hit, a 6th-inning single, as the Senators won 3-0. This time there were 18,555 in attendance. On May 30, 1967 he gave up Jim &quot;Catfish&quot; Hunter&#x27;s first major league home run.

Even though he pitched just 141 innings in 1970, Moore tied for third among American League hurlers with 9 hit batsmen. By contrast, it took the other four pitchers who were tied with him for third an average of 240.1 innings to hit the same number of batters. He was traded along with Bob Miller from the Indians to the White Sox for Buddy Bradford and Tommie Sisk before the trade deadline on June 15, 1970. After a 3–9 campaign with a 5.30 earned run average (ERA), he was dealt from the White Sox to the New York Yankees for Bill Robinson on December 3, 1970.

Moore did have a tendency to be wild, as he gave up 300 walks in just 599.2 innings pitched, for a BB/9IP of 4.50, much higher than the American League average at that time. Often, a pitcher who walks a lot of batters strikes out a lot, too, but that wasn&#x27;t the case with Moore. With 278 strikeouts, his K/9IP was 4.17, which was lower than the American League average.

Career totals for 143 games played (140 as a pitcher) include a 26-37 record, 99 games started, 8 complete games, 1 shutout, 14 games finished, and 3 saves. He allowed 277 earned runs in his 599.2 innings, giving him a lifetime ERA of 4.16.

<doc id="674543" wikidata="Q1848222" url="?curid=674543" title="Wroxeter">
<text>Wroxeter ( ) is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Wroxeter and Uppington, in the Shropshire district, in the ceremonial county of Shropshire, England. It is beside the River Severn, south-east of Shrewsbury. In 1961 the parish had a population of 657.

&quot;Viroconium Cornoviorum&quot;, the fourth largest city in Roman Britain, was sited here, and is gradually being excavated. In 2024, archaeologists uncovered a 2,000 year old mosaic depicting dolphins and fish.

The village contains one of Shropshire&#x27;s commercial vineyards.

==History==
Roman Wroxeter, near the end of the Watling Street Roman road that ran across Romanised Celtic Britain from &quot;Dubris&quot; (Dover), was a key frontier position lying on the bank of the River Severn whose valley penetrated deep into what later became known as Wales, and also on a route south leading to the Wye valley.

Archaeology has shown that the site of the later city first was established about AD 55 as a frontier post for a Thracian legionary cohort located at a fort near the Severn river crossing. A few years later a legionary fortress (&quot;castrum&quot;) was built within the site of the later city for the Legio XIV Gemina during their invasion of Wales.

The local British tribe of the Cornovii had their original capital (also thought to have been named *Uiroconion) at the hillfort on the Wrekin. When the Cornovii were eventually subdued their capital was moved to Wroxeter and given its Roman name.

This legion XIV Gemina was later replaced by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix which in turn relocated to Chester around AD 88. As the military abandoned the fortress the site was taken over by the Cornovians&#x27; civilian settlement.

The name of the settlement, meaning &quot;Viroconium of the Cornovians&quot;, preserves a native Brittonic name that has been reconstructed as *Uiroconion (&quot;[the city] of *Uirokū&quot;), where *&quot;Uiro-ku&quot; ( &quot;man&quot;-&quot;wolf&quot;) is believed to have been a masculine given name meaning &quot;werewolf&quot;. 
Viroconium prospered over the next century, with the construction of many public buildings, including thermae and a colonnaded forum. At its peak, it is thought to have been the 4th-largest settlement in Roman Britain, with a population of more than 15,000.

The Roman city is first documented in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geography&quot; as one of the cities of the Cornovii tribe, along with Chester (Deva Victrix).

Following the Roman withdrawal from Britain around AD 410, the Cornovians seem to have divided into Pengwern and Powys, although the territorial name may have continued into this period. The minor Magonsæte sub-kingdom also emerged in the area in the interlude between Powysian and Mercian rule. Viroconium may have served as the early post-Roman capital of Powys prior to its removal to Mathrafal sometime before 717, following famine and plague in the area. The city has been variously identified with the and which appeared in the 9th-century &quot;History of the Britons&quot;″s list of the 28 cities of Britain.

N. J. Higham proposes that Wroxeter became the eponymous capital of an early sub-Roman kingdom known as the &quot;Wrocensaete&quot;, which he asserts was the successor territorial unit to Cornovia. The literal meaning of &quot;Wrocensaete&quot; is &#x27;those dwelling at &quot;Wrocen&quot;&#x27;, which Higham interprets as Wroxeter. It may refer quite specifically to the royal court itself, in the first instance, and only by extension to the territory administered from the court.

The Roman city was rediscovered in 1859 when workmen began excavating the baths complex. A replica Roman villa was constructed in 2010 for a Channel 4 television programme called &quot;Rome Wasn&#x27;t Built in a Day&quot; and was opened to the public on 19 February 2011.

On 1 April 1986 the parish was abolished and merged with Uppington to form &quot;Uppington &amp; Wroxeter&quot;.

==St Andrew&#x27;s==

At the centre of Wroxeter village is Saint Andrew&#x27;s parish church, some of which is built from re-used Roman masonry. The oldest visible section of the church is the Anglo-Saxon part of the north wall which is built of Roman monumental stone blocks. The chancel and the lower part of the tower are Norman. The gatepiers to the churchyard are a pair of Roman columns and the font in the church was made by hollowing out the capital of a Roman column. Later additions to the church incorporate remains of an Anglo-Saxon preaching cross and carvings salvaged from nearby Haughmond Abbey following the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

St. Andrew&#x27;s was declared redundant in 1980 and is now managed by The Churches Conservation Trust. St. Andrew&#x27;s parish is now united with that of St. Mary, Eaton Constantine.

==Literary reference==
A. E. Housman visited the site and was impressed enough to write of &quot;when Uricon the city stood&quot;, the poem ending &quot;Today the Roman and his trouble Are ashes under Uricon.&quot;

Bernard Cornwell has the main character of &quot;The Saxon Stories&quot; visit Wroxeter in &quot;Death of Kings&quot;, referring to it as an ancient Roman city that was &quot;as big as London&quot; and using it as an illustration of his pagan beliefs that the World will end in chaos.

==Sport==
The village previously had a football team named Wroxeter Rovers. In 2017, the club relocated to nearby Shrewsbury and was renamed to Shrewsbury Juniors, in order to provide a senior football team for children progressing through the club&#x27;s junior football system to take part in after the age of 16–17. The club were champions of the Shropshire County League Premier Division in 2020-21.

<text>The was a professional baseball league in Japan which operated from 1936 to 1949, before reorganizing in 1950 as Nippon Professional Baseball.

The league&#x27;s dominant team was Tokyo Kyojin (renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947), which won nine league championships, including six in a row from 1938 to 1943, when many of Japan&#x27;s best players were serving in the Imperial Japanese Army.

Standout players from the Japanese Baseball League era included Haruyasu Nakajima, Tetsuharu Kawakami, and Kazuto Tsuruoka; pitchers Hideo Fujimoto, Eiji Sawamura, Victor Starffin, and Tadashi Wakabayashi; and two-way players Fumio Fujimura, Shosei Go, Masaru Kageura, and Jiro Noguchi.

== League structure ==
Unlike American pro teams, Japanese Baseball League teams were usually named after their corporate owners/sponsors rather than the cities or regions in which they played. This was because Japanese franchising does not have strong territorial requirements as in the Major Leagues; as a result, the JBL teams clustered in metropolitan areas in Japan&#x27;s center (Tokyo, Nagoya) and south (Osaka). As a result, teams were notorious for how often they changed their names, often because of changes in ownership/sponsorship (and also because of nationalistic regulations imposed during wartime, such as the outlawing of English team names). (The Yomiuri Giants, the Chunichi Dragons, and the Hanshin Tigers are the only surviving major clubs that have always been based in their respective cities. Additionally, the current Orix Buffaloes are a merger of two clubs which never left their hometowns.)

Most Japanese Baseball League teams did not have an &quot;official&quot; home stadium; instead, teams played at any stadium in the area in which they were based. All league championships went to whoever had the best record at the end of the season, without a postseason series being played.

== History ==
The league was established on February 5, 1936, as the Japan Occupational Baseball League, with an initial complement of seven teams. Three of the teams were based in Tokyo, two in Osaka, and two in Nagoya. 

Due to a lack of position players, a number of players in the league both pitched and batted. At first (until after World War II), the JBL was a &quot;dead ball&quot; league, due to Japan conserving rubber (including inside baseballs) for its war efforts; instead it used Balatá inside the balls. Initially, the league played split seasons, doing so from 1936 to 1938. In the debut 1936 season, it split into spring, summer, and fall seasons, only keeping track of the standings in the fall season. The league played spring and fall seasons in 1937 (approximartely a 100-game schedule in total) and 1938 (total 75-game schedule), adding one new team each year. 

The league was renamed the Japanese Baseball League in 1939, playing a 96-game schedule. Before the 1940 season, one of the founding teams, Nagoya Kinko (originally the Nagoya Golden Dolphins), merged with the Tokyo Senators. The 1940 season featured a 104-game schedule.

In October 1940 (responding to rising hostility toward the West due to World War II), the league outlawed the use of English in Japanese baseball. In response, the Korakuen Eagles became &quot;Kurowashi&quot;, the Osaka Tigers became &quot;Hanshin&quot;, the Tokyo Senators became &quot;Tsubasa&quot;, and (eventually) Lion became &quot;Asahi.&quot;

In 1941, the JBL appointed its first president, Jiro Morioka (formerly VP of Dai Tokyo). Morioka negotiated with the Japanese Imperial Army to keep professional baseball going through the early years of the Second World War.
The league played a 90-game schedule in 1941, a 104-game schedule in 1942, and an 84-game schedule in 1943.

Two Tokyo-based teams dissolved before the 1944 season: the Yamato Baseball Club (originally the Korakuen Eagles) and the Nishitetsu Baseball Club (originally the Tokyo Senators).

Due to the Pacific War, the 1944 season was truncated to about 35 games, and the 1945 season was skipped entirely. Many players enlisted in the Japanese Imperial Army, with 72 of them losing their lives in the war. 

The league restarted on November 6, 1945, and a full season of 105 games was played the next year, with two new teams (both based in Tokyo) joining the league. One of the new teams, Gold Star, was owned by textile manufacturer Komajiro Tamura, who also owned Pacific (formerly Asahi).

A rival four-team league, known as the , played a 30-game summer season in 1947. Unable to compete against the more established JBL, however, the Kokumin League disbanded a few games into the 1947 fall season.

The Japanese Baseball League played a 119-game schedule in 1947. That year, baseball personality Sōtaro Suzuki proposed that JBL teams should have pet names like the Yomiuri Giants&#x27;, whose pet name was &quot;Kyojin&quot;, and names such as the Osaka Tigers&#x27; alias &quot;Mouko&quot; (&quot;fierce tiger&quot;), the revived Tokyo Senators&#x27; &quot;Seito&quot; (&quot;bluestockings&quot;) and the Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Taihei&quot; (&quot;tranquility&quot;) began to be used by the press. However, some teams rejected the use of these pet names, so they were never fully adopted. The 1948 season had a 140-game schedule, and the 1949 season had a 134-game schedule.

After the 1949 season, the league reorganized into today&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB). The four earliest-established clubs formerly in the Japanese Baseball League were placed in NPB&#x27;s Central League, while the four later surviving franchises went to the Pacific League.

== Foreign players ==
Victor Starffin, an ethnic Russian pitcher, was a dominant player of the era and the first professional pitcher in Japan to win 300 games.

Shosei Go, nicknamed &quot;The Human Locomotive&quot;, was a speedy player from Taiwan who played in the league for the Kyojin and the Tigers. He won the 1943 JBL Most Valuable Player award as a member of the champion Kyojin. Hiroshi Oshita was another Taiwanese player who starred in the JBL. From 1946 to 1949 he played for the Tokyo Senators/Tokyu Flyers. (After reorganization, Oshita stayed with the Flyers until 1951, and then moved to the Nishitetsu Lions, finishing his Japanese professional career with a .303 lifetime batting average, 201 home runs, and 861 RBI.)

Harris McGalliard (Japan&#x27;s &quot;Bucky Harris&quot;), Herbert &quot;Buster&quot; North, and James E. Bonner (&quot;Jimmy Bonna&quot;) became the first Americans to play in Japan&#x27;s professional baseball league in 1936. (Bonner was African-American, thus beating Jackie Robinson to professional baseball 11 years before Robinson broke in with the Brooklyn Dodgers.) They were joined by the Japanese-American players Kiyomi &quot;Slim&quot; Hirakawa, Fumito &quot;Jimmy&quot; Horio, Kazuyoshi &quot;George&quot; Matsuura, Yoshio &quot;Sam&quot; Takahashi, and Tadashi &quot;Bozo&quot; Wakabayashi.

<text>The New Leviathan Oriental Fox-Trot Orchestra is an American revival orchestra, that performs authentic orchestrations of vintage American popular music from the 1890s through the early 1930s. The orchestra plays particular attention to the music of New Orleans, Louisiana, where it is based. In addition to the well known compositions of jazz and ragtime composers like Jelly Roll Morton, Fletcher Henderson, and Eubie Blake, the orchestra&#x27;s repertory includes the work of less well remembered New Orleans Tin Pan Alley composers such as Larry Buck, Joe Verges, Paul Sarebresole and Nick Clesi.

Taking its name from the SS Leviathan, a transatlantic ocean liner with a well regarded dance band at the start of the 1920s, the orchestra was founded in 1972. Their first performance was at Tulane University, presenting a rather tongue-in-cheek concert of &quot;best loved Oriental Foxtrots&quot; (a then largely forgotten early 20th-century dance music genre), partially satirizing the then-current revival of scholarly interest in classic ragtime.

The orchestra has appeared in Europe and throughout the United States. Recordings were featured in the soundtracks of Woody Allen&#x27;s 1994 film &quot;Bullets over Broadway&quot; and &quot;Storyville&quot; (1992), directed by Mark Frost. New Leviathan performs frequently, and makes a fondly anticipated yearly appearance at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. The exact personnel of the orchestra varies, but it frequently features 18 or more pieces. In 2007, the musical director is Greg Merritt, associate music director is Larry Jones and managing director is John Craft.

<text>Pembridge is a village and civil parish in the Arrow valley in Herefordshire, England. The village is on the A44 road about east of Kington and west of Leominster. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Bearwood, Lower Bearwood, Lower Broxwood, Marston, Moorcot and Weston. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,056.

Pembridge is the major part of the electoral ward of Pembridge and Lyonshall with Titley. The 2011 Census recorded the ward&#x27;s population as 3,124.

==History==
The toponym &quot;Pembridge&quot; may be derived from the Welsh , anglicised to its current spelling. A more likely origin of the name Pembridge is that it is derived from the Old English Penebrug(g)e, which probably meant &quot;Pena&#x27;s bridge&quot;.
In 1239, Pembridge was granted a royal charter to hold a market and two fairs: the Cowslip Fair held each May and the Woodcock Fair held each November. In the Middle Ages they were important events for agricultural labourers across the county to seek work from landowners.

The village is noted for its historic timber-framed buildings. It is promoted to visitors as &quot;the heart of the Black and White Village Trail&quot;.

In West Street, Swan House and School View are two parts of a single building. It was built in the 14th century a hall house, but had an intermediate floor inserted late in the 16th or early in the 17th century. It was further altered in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is a Grade II* listed building. Also in West Street, Forsythia and West Leigh are two parts of another former hall house. It was built in the 14th or 15th century, and altered in the 17th and 19th centuries. It is a Grade II* listed building.

In the Market Place, the core of the Post Office and Stores is another 14th-century house. It was remodelled in the 17th and late 19th centuries and is a Grade II* listed building. Also in Market Place is the Market Hall. This timber-framed building, which has been dated by dendrochronology to c.1520, is not actually a market hall, but merely a covered market. Eight oak pillars support a roof tiled with stone slates. These pillars are supported on unworked stone bases except for one, which stands on the remains of the medieval cross base. It is a Grade II* listed building.

In East Street is the former post office. It is a 15th-century house altered in the 17th and 19th centuries.
Pembridge had two sets of almshouses, each divided into six tenements. Duppa&#x27;s Almshouses in Bridge Street were endowed by Jeffrey Duppa and founded in 1661. They were augmented by his son Brian Duppa, a Royalist who was Bishop of Winchester from 1660 until his death in 1662. Trafford&#x27;s Almshouses in East Street were endowed by the Rev Dr Thomas Trafford, DD, and built in 1686.

Elsewhere in the parish, Clear Brook is a mainly 17th-century house with a 16th-century rear wing. The Court of Noke is an 18th-century country house, and the most notable brick-built house in the parish.

Gavin Plumley has written about the history of the village in &quot;A Home for All Seasons&quot; (2022).

===Former railway===
Building of the Leominster and Kington Railway linking and was started in 1855 and completed in 1857. It passed through Pembridge parish, where Pembridge railway station served the village. The Great Western Railway leased the line from the 1860s and absorbed it in 1898. British Railways closed the line to passenger traffic in February 1955 and to freight in late September 1964.

==Landmarks==
===Bridge===
The sandstone bridge over the river Arrow was granted Grade II listed status in June 1987, giving it protection from unauthorised alteration or demolition.

===Parish church===
The chancel is the oldest surviving part of St Mary&#x27;s Church of England parish church, dating from the 13th-century, although a loose Romanesque pillar piscina remains from the Norman church. Blocked arches on both sides of the chancel mark the entrances to former chapels. The splendid font also dates from the 13th-century. The major rebuilding of the church in a mature Decorated style has been dated c1320-30. The noble nave arcade is of six bays, with circular ogeed cinquefoiled clerestory windows above. The church has a cruciform plan with 14th-century transepts and a vaulted north porch. There is a rood stair turret entered from the South transept and topped externally with a pinnacle. The West door and the North door date from the 14th century and both retain original ironwork.

The pulpit preacher&#x27;s desk, lectern and communion rail are Jacobean. A north vestry was added in the 19th century, and the building was restored in 1871 by William Chick and in 1903–09 by Roland W. Paul. The church is a Grade I listed building. On the North side of the chancel a pair of 14th century tomb chests, one with contemporary effigies of a knight and his wife, the other with a civilian and his wife. They date from 1360 to 1380 and depict Nicholas Gour, a Sergeant-at-law with his wife and his son, John Gour and his wife, a steward in the employ of the Mortimer family. There are also several memorial tablets, including three of the 17th century to the Sherborne family, and one to Thomas Trafford (d.1685).

====Belltower====
Pembridge is one of several Herefordshire parishes whose belltower stands separate from the church. All but the base of the tower is timber-framed: one of a number of partly or largely timber-framed belltowers in Herefordshire. The tower was built early in the 13th century, rebuilt with the addition of an ambulatory in the 15th or 16th century, and further remodelled in the 17th-century when its spire was added. It is a Grade I listed building.

The tower has a ring of five bells. John I Martin of Worcester cast the fourth bell in 1658. Abraham II Rudhall of Gloucester cast the treble bell in 1735. James Barwell of Birmingham cast or recast the first, second and tenor bells in 1898. St Mary&#x27;s has also a Sanctus bell, which was cast about 1800.

The churchyard contains seven Commonwealth war graves of service personnel, two from World War I and five from World War II.

==Amenities==

Ye Olde Steppes in East Street is both the village shop and a café and tea room. It is in a 16th-century building that was enlarged in the 17th century and altered in the 19th century.

There is a 17th-century pub, the New Inn, in Market Place. Pembridge had a 16th-century pub, the Greyhound Inn in East Street, but this is now the King&#x27;s House restaurant. Also in the parish is the Cider Barn bar and restaurant at Hays Head, which opens seasonally.

<text>Shane David Halter (born November 8, 1969) is an American former Major League Baseball utility player.

==Early life==
Halter attended Hooks High School in Hooks, Texas and was a letterman in football, basketball, baseball, track, and golf. Halter played for the Norfolk Tides, a minor league baseball team located in Norfolk, Virginia.

==Major League Baseball career==
Halter played for the Kansas City Royals (1997–1998), New York Mets (1999), Detroit Tigers (2000–2003), and Anaheim Angels (2004). Although he was essentially a backup player, he had notable power and he was adequate defensively in all infield and outfield positions.

On October 1, 2000, Halter showed his versatility by playing all nine positions in a single game, joining Bert Campaneris (Kansas City Athletics, September 8, 1965), César Tovar (Minnesota Twins, September 22, 1968), Scott Sheldon (Texas Rangers, September 6, 2000), and Andrew Romine (Detroit Tigers, September 30, 2017), in the select list of players to play all nine positions in a Major League game. Halter went 4 for 5 at the plate with 3 RBI, and also scored the game-winning run against the Minnesota Twins in the bottom of the ninth.

In his 644-game career, Halter batted .246, with 45 home runs and 197 runs batted in.

<doc id="674564" wikidata="Q7174664" url="?curid=674564" title="Peter Hill-Norton">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Peter John Hill-Norton, Baron Hill-Norton, (8 February 1915 – 16 May 2004) was a senior Royal Navy officer. He fought in the Second World War as gunnery officer in a cruiser operating on the Western Approaches and in the North Sea taking part in the Norwegian Campaign, then in a cruiser taking part in the Arctic convoys and finally in a battleship operating in the Eastern Fleet. After the War he commanded a destroyer and then an aircraft carrier. He served as First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff and then Chief of the Defence Staff in early 1970s. In the latter role he gave the final commitment to Project Chevaline, the Polaris missile improvement programme. He went on to be Chairman of the NATO Military Committee.

==Naval career==
Born the son of Captain Martin John Norton RFC and Margery Birnie Norton (née Hill), Peter John Norton (he changed his surname to Hill-Norton in 1931) was educated at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth and the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1928 and, having been promoted to midshipman on 1 May 1932, was posted to the cruiser HMS &quot;London&quot; later that year. He transferred to the battleship HMS &quot;Rodney&quot; in September 1934 and, having been promoted to sub-lieutenant on 1 September 1935, he was posted to the battleship HMS &quot;Ramillies&quot; in August 1936. Promoted to lieutenant on 1 October 1936, he attended the gunnery course at the shore establishment HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; in 1939.

Hill-Norton served during the Second World War initially as a gunnery instructor at HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; and then as gunnery officer on the cruiser HMS &quot;Cairo&quot; operating on the Western Approaches and in the North Sea and taking part in the Norwegian Campaign in Spring 1940. He then transferred to the cruiser which took part in the Arctic convoys. He joined the staff of the gunnery division at the Admiralty in 1943 and, having been promoted to lieutenant commander on 1 April 1944, became gunnery officer on the battleship operating in the Eastern Fleet later that year. With HMS &quot;Howe&quot; he took part in the attack on the Sakishima Islands.

After the end of the War, Hill-Norton became gunnery officer on the cruiser in the South Atlantic and then, having been promoted to commander on 31 December 1947, he was posted to the naval ordnance division at the Admiralty. He became executive officer of the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Eagle&quot; in 1951 and participated in Exercise Mainbrace. Promoted to captain on 31 December 1952, he was posted to Buenos Aires as naval attaché to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay in September 1953 before commanding the destroyer during the Suez Crisis in 1956. He became Head of the Weapon Equipment Section at the Admiralty in 1957 and Director of the Tactical and Weapons Policy Division there in 1958. He was given command of the aircraft carrier in October 1959, before being promoted to rear admiral on 8 January 1962 and being appointed Assistant Chief of Naval Staff in February 1962. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1964 New Year Honours. He was made Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet in June 1964 during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and, having been promoted to vice admiral on 7 August 1965, he became Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel and Logistics) at the Ministry of Defence in 1966. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1967 New Year Honours. Becoming Second Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Personnel in January 1967, it was in this capacity that he took the decision to abolish the Royal Navy&#x27;s traditional daily rum ration. He went on to be Vice Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1967 and, having been promoted to full admiral on 1 October 1968, he became Commander-in-Chief Far East Command in March 1969. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1970 Birthday Honours.

Hill-Norton was swiftly propelled into the post of First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in July 1970 and then, having been promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 12 March 1971, into the post of Chief of the Defence Staff in April 1971 following the unexpected early retirement of Sir Michael Le Fanu due to ill health. In the latter role he gave the final commitment to Project Chevaline, the Polaris missile improvement programme. He became Chairman of the NATO Military Committee in 1974, remaining in that post until his retirement in 1977.

==Later career==
Hill-Norton was made a life peer as Baron Hill-Norton, of South Nutfield in the County of Surrey, in February 1979, and took an active role at the House of Lords as a crossbencher. He was President of the Sea Cadet Association, Chairman of the Royal Navy Club of 1765 &amp; 1785 (United 1889), a Liveryman of the Shipwrights&#x27; Company and a Freeman of the City of London. He authored a book entitled &quot;No Soft Options: The Politico-Military Realities of NATO&quot; in 1978 and another entitled &quot;Sea Power: Story of Warships and Navies&quot; in 1982. He also narrated a series on sea power for BBC Television in 1985. In later years he took an interest in UFOs, writing about them and expressing concern in Parliament about the potential destruction of files on them.

Hill-Norton&#x27;s interests included gardening and shooting. He lived at Hyde near Fordingbridge in Hampshire and died of a heart attack at Studland Bay in Dorset on 16 May 2004.

==Family==
In 1936 he married Eileen Linstow; they had one son (Vice Admiral Sir Nicholas Hill-Norton) and one daughter.

<doc id="674571" wikidata="Q5336317" url="?curid=674571" title="Eddie Milner">
<text>Edward James Milner Jr. (May 21, 1955 – November 2, 2015) was an American professional baseball player. He played all or parts of nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds (1980–86, 1988) and San Francisco Giants (1987), primarily as a center fielder. Milner batted and threw left-handed.

==Baseball career==
Milner was drafted out of Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio by the Reds in 1976. He was a part of the disappointing transition of the championship Cincinnati Reds teams of the 1970s. The Reds transitioned from players including Ken Griffey Sr., George Foster, and Ray Knight, taking their chances with players including Milner, Gary Redus, and Clint Hurdle. A highlight of Milner&#x27;s career was a 20-game hitting streak in 1986 in which he had batted .417 to go along with a .667 slugging percentage.

Milner suffered from cocaine addiction during his baseball career. Commissioner Peter Ueberroth suspended him for the entire 1988 season after he relapsed, but he was reinstated before the All-Star break after completing a drug rehabilitation program. The Reds released him on July 31, ending his major league career.

==Career statistics==
In a nine-year major league career, Milner played in 804 games, accumulating 607 hits in 2,395 at bats for a .253 career batting average along with 42 home runs, 195 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .333. Defensively, he finished his career with a .987 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions. Along with César Tovar, Milner is regarded as the all-time major league leader in breaking up no-hit attempts with five. On August 2, 1986, Milner collected his team&#x27;s only hit in a game for fifth time, tying Tovar&#x27;s major league record (1975).

==Personal life==

Milner&#x27;s cousin, John Milner, was also a major league player.

Milner died on November 2, 2015, in Cincinnati.

<doc id="674576" wikidata="Q1340378" url="?curid=674576" title="Francis Palgrave">
<text>Sir Francis Palgrave, (; born Francis Ephraim Cohen, July 1788 – 6 July 1861) was an English archivist and historian. He was Deputy Keeper (chief executive) of the Public Record Office from its foundation in 1838 until his death; and he is also remembered for his many scholarly publications.

== Early life ==
Francis Cohen was born in London, the son of Meyer Cohen, a Jewish stockbroker (d. 1831) by his wife Rachel Levien Cohen (d. 1815). His maternal grandfather was Gotschal (Eliakim ben Yehuda) Levien, a wealthy merchant who immigrated from Germany and became a leader of the Anglo-Jewish community. Francis was initially articled as a clerk to a London solicitor&#x27;s firm, and remained there as chief clerk until 1822. His father was financially ruined in 1810 and Francis, the eldest son, became responsible for supporting his parents. Around 1814, Francis Cohen began contributing to the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;; he made the acquaintance of the banker Dawson Turner and his daughter Elizabeth in 1819, offering to correct the proofs of Turner&#x27;s &quot;Architectural Antiquities of Normandy&quot;. In 1821, Francis Cohen was admitted to the Fellowship of the Royal Society, one of his sponsors being Turner. Cohen converted to Anglican Christianity before his marriage to Elizabeth Turner on 13 October 1823.

Around the time of his marriage, Cohen also changed his surname to &quot;Palgrave&quot; (his wife&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name) by royal licence. It is not clear if either the religious conversion or the name change were conditions of his marriage; however, his father-in-law paid for the expenses of the name change, and settled £3,000 on the couple.

== Career ==

Palgrave was called to the bar in 1827 (after a long period working for solicitors, 1803–1822).

In 1822, he had advocated publishing the national records, and from 1827 he edited several volumes of medieval texts for the Record Commission, including &quot;Parliamentary Writs and Writs of Military Summons&quot; (2 volumes, 1827 and 1834; including in vol. 2 a text of &quot;Nomina Villarum&quot;) and &quot;Rotuli Curiae Regis: Rolls and Records of the Court held before the King&#x27;s Justiciars or Justices&quot; (2 volumes, 1835). Meanwhile, he was also publishing historical works of his own, including &quot;A History of England&quot; (1831), &quot;The Rise and Progress of the English Commonwealth&quot; (1832), &quot;An Essay on the Original Authority of the King&#x27;s Council&quot; (1834), &quot;Truths and Fictions of the Middle Ages: the Merchant and the Friar&quot; (1837) and &quot;The History of Normandy and England&quot; (1851–64, 4 volumes, of which the last two appeared posthumously).

Palgrave is considered the founder of the Public Record Office. In 1834 he succeeded John Caley as the Keeper of the Records in the chapter house of Westminster Abbey, in which were stored the ancient records of the Exchequer (including Domesday Book), as well as various parliamentary records. From this appointment emerged another important editorial work for the Record Commission, &quot;The Ancient Kalendars and Inventories of the Treasury of His Majesty&#x27;s Exchequer&quot; (3 volumes, 1836). In 1838 he was appointed Deputy Keeper of the new Public Record Office, holding that position until his death. In this position, he issued a series of 22 annual reports. 

Palgrave was knighted in 1832. In 1834, he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1860.

== Family ==
Palgrave married Elizabeth Turner (1799–1852) on 13 October 1823. She was the daughter of Dawson Turner (1775–1858) and Mary née Palgrave (1775–1858). Her sister Maria Dawson Turner (1797–1872) married Sir William Jackson Hooker (1785–1865).

Francis and Elizabeth Palgrave were the parents of four sons, all distinguished and all authors in their respective fields:

#Francis Turner Palgrave (1824–1897), poet, anthologist, educationist and bureaucrat, editor of &quot;Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics&quot;, better known as &quot;Palgrave&#x27;s Golden Treasury&quot;
#(William) Gifford Palgrave (1826–1888 Montevideo, Uruguay), Jesuit priest and missionary turned diplomat, anthropologist and traveller
# Sir Robert Harry Inglis Palgrave (1827–1919), economist, knighted 1909, author of &quot;Palgrave&#x27;s Dictionary of Political Economy&quot;, and editor of &quot;Palgrave&#x27;s Collected Historical Works&quot;. He married in 1859 Sarah Maria Brightwen, daughter of George Brightwen.
#Sir Reginald Francis Douce Palgrave (1829–1904), Clerk of the House of Commons 1886–1902. Married Grace Battley, daughter of Richard Battley, in 1857.

Palgrave&#x27;s wife predeceased him in August 1852.

<doc id="674582" wikidata="Q861176" url="?curid=674582" title="Trilinear interpolation">
<text>Trilinear interpolation is a method of multivariate interpolation on a 3-dimensional regular grid. It approximates the value of a function at an intermediate point formula_1 within the local axial rectangular prism linearly, using function data on the lattice points. 
Trilinear interpolation is frequently used in numerical analysis, data analysis, and computer graphics.

== Related methods ==

Trilinear interpolation is the extension of linear interpolation, which operates in spaces with dimension formula_2, and bilinear interpolation, which operates with dimension formula_3, to dimension formula_4. These interpolation schemes all use polynomials of order 1, giving an accuracy of order 2, and it requires formula_5 adjacent pre-defined values surrounding the interpolation point. There are several ways to arrive at trilinear interpolation, which is equivalent to 3-dimensional tensor B-spline interpolation of order 1, and the trilinear interpolation operator is also a tensor product of 3 linear interpolation operators.

For an arbitrary, unstructured mesh (as used in finite element analysis), other methods of interpolation must be used; if all the mesh elements are tetrahedra (3D simplices), then barycentric coordinates provide a straightforward procedure.

==Formulation==
On a periodic and cubic lattice, let formula_6, formula_7, and formula_8 
be the differences between each of formula_9, formula_10, formula_11 and the smaller coordinate related, that is:

:formula_12

where formula_13 indicates the lattice point below formula_14, and formula_15 indicates the lattice point above formula_14 and similarly for
formula_17 and formula_18.

First one interpolates along formula_9 (imagine one is &quot;pushing&quot; the face of the cube defined by formula_20 to the opposing face, defined by formula_21), giving:
: formula_22

Where formula_23 means the function value of formula_24 Then one interpolates these values (along formula_10, &quot;pushing&quot; from formula_26 to formula_27), giving:
: formula_28

Finally one interpolates these values along formula_11 (walking through a line):
:formula_30
This gives us a predicted value for the point.

The result of trilinear interpolation is independent of the order of the interpolation steps along the three axes: any other order, for instance along formula_9, then along formula_10, and finally along formula_11, produces the same value.

===Algorithm visualization===
The above operations can be visualized as follows: First we find the eight corners of a cube that surround our point of interest. These corners have the values formula_23, formula_35, formula_36, formula_37, formula_38, formula_39, formula_40, formula_41.

Next, we perform linear interpolation between formula_23 and formula_35 to find formula_44, formula_38 and formula_39 to find formula_47, formula_40 and formula_41 to find formula_50, formula_36 and formula_37 to find formula_53.

Now we do interpolation between formula_44 and formula_53 to find formula_56, formula_47 and formula_50 to find formula_59. Finally, we calculate the value formula_60 via linear interpolation of formula_56 and formula_59

In practice, a trilinear interpolation is identical to two bilinear interpolation combined with a linear interpolation:
:formula_63

===Alternative algorithm===
An alternative way to write the solution to the interpolation problem is
:formula_64

where the coefficients are found by solving the linear system
:formula_65

yielding the result

:formula_66

<doc id="674587" wikidata="Q1013818" url="?curid=674587" title="Little League World Series">
<text>The Little League World Series is an annual baseball tournament for children (primarily boys) aged 10 to 12 years old, held in the Eastern United States. Originally called the National Little League Tournament, it was later renamed for the World Series in Major League Baseball. The Series was first held in 1947 and is held every August in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania; while the postal address of the organization is in Williamsport, the Series itself is played at Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Volunteer Stadium at the Little League headquarters complex in South Williamsport.

Initially, only teams from the United States competed in the Series, but it has since become a worldwide tournament. The tournament has gained popular renown, especially in the United States, where games from the Series and even from regional tournaments are broadcast on ESPN. Teams from the United States have won a plurality of the series, although from 1969 to 1991 teams from Taiwan dominated the series, winning in 15 out of those 23 years. From 2010 through 2017, teams from Japan similarly dominated the series, winning five of those matchups.

While the Little League Baseball World Series is frequently referred to as just the Little League World Series, it is actually one of seven World Series tournaments sponsored by Little League International, in different locations. Each of them brings community teams from different Little League International regions around the world together in baseball (four age divisions) and girls&#x27; softball (three age divisions). The tournament structure described here is that used for the Little League Baseball World Series. The structure used for the other World Series is similar, but with different regions.

==Qualifying tournaments==

In the summer months leading up to the Little League World Series, held each year in August, Little Leagues around the world select All-Star teams made up of players from each league. It is these All-Star teams that compete in district, sectional and/or divisional, and regional tournaments, hoping to advance to Williamsport for the Little League World Series. How many games a team has to play varies from region to region. In the United States, the tournaments at the lowest (district) level lack nationwide standardization. Some use pool play or double elimination, while others use single elimination.

In the United States, the fate of district winners varies widely from state to state. In some larger states such as Pennsylvania, New York, and California, the district winners advance to one of many sectional tournaments. The winners of each sectional tournament then advance to a state or divisional tournament, the latter only being held in Texas and California and are similar to the state tournaments held in less populous states. Most smaller states lack competition at the sectional level and go straight from district to state tournaments. A handful of states are composed of only one district, and the district champion is the automatic state champion.

With two exceptions, every state as well as the District of Columbia crowns a state champion, and sends that team to represent it to one of ten regional tournaments. The exceptions involve California and Texas. Because of their large geographic and population sizes, California and Texas send two representatives to their regional tournament; Northern California and Southern California in the West region tournament and Texas East and Texas West (whose areas encompass more than the geographical areas of East Texas and West Texas, splitting roughly along the I-35/I-37 corridor) compete in the Southwest region tournament. Up through 2018, the Dakotas had one district spanning the two states, and its winner became the joint champion when advancing to the Midwest region tournament. However, beginning in 2019, North Dakota and South Dakota are represented by individual teams in the regional tournament — creating an odd number of teams first in the Midwest Regional and then (beginning in 2022) in the Great Lakes Regional.

The state champions (as well as the Northern California, Southern California, Texas East, Texas West, and District of Columbia teams) compete in one of ten different regional tournaments (increasing from 8 in 2022). Each regional tournament winner then advances to the Little League World Series. A comprehensive breakdown of current and historical US regional tournament locations, participants and results is available online. Since the geographical boundaries of the District of Columbia are exactly the same as the capital city of Washington, this District is usually identified specifically as &quot;Washington, DC.&quot;

Other countries and regions pick their own way of crowning a champion. Little League Canada holds tournaments at the provincial and divisional level to field six champions (four provincial and two divisional) at the national tournament: Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, the Prairie Provinces (Saskatchewan and Manitoba), and the Atlantic Provinces. The host site of the national tournament varies from year to year, and the host team gets an automatic berth as the seventh team. The tournament is played as a round robin and uses the Page playoff format. The winner of the national tournament earns the right to represent Canada at the Little League World Series.

===Regions===
Beginning with the 2022 tournament, 10 regional tournament winners compete in the United States bracket of the Little League World Series. The states those regional champions could possibly hail from are as listed below using U.S. state abbreviations. There are 53 total U.S. entrants that compete in the 10 regional tournaments: two from Texas, two from California, one each from the remaining 48 U.S. states, and one from the District of Columbia.
* Great Lakes (IL, IN, KY, MI, OH)
* Metro (CT, NJ, NY, RI)
* Mid-Atlantic (DE, DC, MD, PA)
* Midwest (IA, KS, MN, MO, NE, ND, SD, WI)
* Mountain (CO, MT, NV, UT, WY)
* New England (ME, MA, NH, VT)
* Northwest (AK, ID, OR, WA)
* Southeast (AL, FL, GA, NC, SC, TN, VA, WV)
* Southwest (AR, LA, MS, NM, OK, TX East, TX West)
* West (AZ, Northern CA, Southern CA, HI)
There are eight international divisions, which provide 10 teams to the international bracket of the tournament. This is due to Cuba, Panama, and Puerto Rico receiving automatic bids to the LLWS on a rotating basis—annually, two teams receive a bid while the other plays through its regional tournament (Cuba or Puerto Rico through the Caribbean region; Panama through Latin America region).

* Asia-Pacific and Middle East
* Australia
* Canada
* Caribbean
* Europe and Africa
* Japan
* Latin America
* Mexico
The above regions reflect various historical realignments, including those implemented in 2013 and 2022. Historical detail is provided in articles about the individual regions.

Divisions which compete in the United States bracket represent 96% of worldwide players in Little League with over 2.2 million participants, while the divisions in the International bracket represent the remaining 4% (less than 130,000 participants).

==World Series tournament format==

Currently, the Little League World Series consists of 20 teams: 10 from the United States, and 10 from other countries. The U.S. and international teams play in separate brackets, in a double-elimination format. The winners of each bracket then play each other for the LLWS championship game.

From the inaugural 1947 tournament through 1956, there were predominantly U.S.-based teams, usually eight, competing in a single-elimination format. One Canadian team played in 1952, and one in 1953. Regions were introduced in 1957, and that tournament included the first non-U.S. champion, Monterrey, Mexico, although they represented the U.S. South region. International regions were added in 1958. From 1962 through 2000, the eight teams in the tournament came from four U.S. and four international regions:
* United States: Central, East, South, West
* International: Canada, Europe, Far East, Latin America

Through 1975, all teams competed in one bracket. That year, the tournament was held with only the teams from the U.S. regions. The international teams returned in 1976, when two brackets were established, one with U.S. teams, and the other with international teams. The U.S. bracket winner and the international bracket winner would then meet in the championship game, an arrangement that has continued to the present, independent of subsequent changes made to early rounds of the tournament.

In 2001, the number of regions was doubled to 16. The tournament started with eight U.S. teams, randomly assigned into two four-team pools; and eight international teams, also randomly assigned into two four-team pools. Teams competed round-robin within their own pool, with the top two teams of each pool advancing to single-elimination play for a spot in the U.S. final or international final, followed by the U.S champion and international champion meeting in the World Championship game.

In 2010, round-robin play was replaced by a double-elimination bracket in each four-team pool. The winners of each pool advanced to a single-elimination U.S. championship or international championship game, with those winners advancing to the World Championship game. Additionally, each team in the tournament played a minimum of three games, as any team that lost its first two games would play in a consolation U.S. vs. international game.

In 2011, pools were eliminated, with the eight U.S. teams continuing to compete in one bracket and the eight international teams in another bracket. The tournament is double-elimination until the U.S. championship and international championship games, which remain single-elimination, with those winners advancing to the World Championship game. Each team in the tournament still played a minimum of three games, via consolation games as noted above.

In August 2019, organizers announced that the tournament would expand to 20 teams in 2021, by adding two U.S. participants and two international participants. However, the expansion was delayed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a consequence of this expansion, crossover consolations games that had previously been played between 0–2 teams have been eliminated.

===Venues===

Two venues host World Series games: Howard J. Lamade Stadium and Little League Volunteer Stadium. Lamade Stadium has hosted games since 1959 and added lights in 1992. Volunteer Stadium opened in 2001 when the field expanded to 16 teams. Prior to 1959, the Little League World Series was held at Original Little League on West Fourth Street in Williamsport.

Both fields have symmetrical fences, with a distance of 68.6 m (225 feet) from home plate to each of the outfield positions. That distance had been 62.5 m (205 feet) before 2006.

Admission to all LLWS games is free for all spectators. However, stadium seats for the championship game are distributed in a random drawing of all interested parties due to high demand. Some early round games, mostly games with Pennsylvania teams, will use first-come, first-served admission if a big crowd is to be expected. Lamade Stadium has a berm beyond the fences that has allowed the facility to hold up to 45,000 spectators.

==Age requirements==
From 1947 to 2005, the age limit for players was set at children who turned 13 on August 1 of that year or later. In 2006, the age limit was loosened to include players who turn 13 after April 30. As the Series takes place in August, this led to many of the players having already turned 13 before the Series started. In 2014 Little League voted to change the age cutoff from April 30 to December 31. However, this caused outrage by parents because the players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 would have lost their 12-year-old season because they would be considered to be 13 years old even though they have not reached their 13th birthday. Effective November 2015, a new implementation plan was established, which &quot;grandfathered&quot; players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005 as 12-year-olds for the 2018 season, using April 30 age determination date for the 2018 season. Since 2019, a new determination date of August 31 is used, banning 13-year-old players from participating in the Series.

==Girls in the tournament==
Through the 2024 tournament, a total of 23 girls have participated in the Little League Baseball World Series:
==Noteworthy events==
* – A team from Montreal, Canada, became the first team outside of the United States to play in the tournament.
* – The first walk-off home run in the championship game was hit by Rich Cominski, from Morrisville, Pennsylvania, in the 7th inning.
* – Monterrey, Mexico, only the third team from outside the United States to compete, became the first such team to win the tournament. Pitcher Ángel Macías threw a perfect game, which has not occurred in a championship game since.
* – This was the final tournament to have an all-US championship final, aside from later exceptions of and when only US-based teams competed.

===Championships won by country/state===
===Championship notes===
* In November , &quot;whispers about overage Asian participants grew to shouts&quot; when over a three-year stretch Taiwan outscored U.S. teams, 120–2, in a span of nine Little League World Series games. Then LLWS chairman Peter McGovern reluctantly agreed to a blanket ban of all international teams. After an uproar of criticism and an investigation that could produce no evidence of rules violations, the ban was rescinded for the event.
* In , the tournament was split into two brackets; one for International teams, and one for teams representing the United States. As a result, a team representing the United States is assured of being in the finals each year.
* In , Mexicali, Mexico, represented the West Region of the United States in the Little League World Series. Because of its proximity to the El Centro/Calexico area in Southern California, Mexicali competed in and represented California&#x27;s District 22 in the Southern California division from 1957 to 1985, representing the bordering city of Calexico, California.
* In , Long Beach was declared a 6–0 winner after the international tournament committee determined that Zamboanga City had used ineligible players that were either not from within its city limits, over age, or both. The championship game was originally won by Zamboanga City, 15–4.
* From 1997 to 2002, no teams from Taiwan participated in the tournament. In 1997, the Taiwan Baseball Association decided its leagues would no longer charter with Little League. From the introduction of Far East teams in 1967 until after 1996, Taiwan had won 17 of a possible 30 championships and had been runner-up twice.
::Due to complicated relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China—commonly known as Taiwan—is recognized by the name Chinese Taipei by a majority of international organizations, including Little League Baseball. LLWS records and news accounts may use Republic of China, Taiwan, or Chinese Taipei to refer to the same entity.
* In , Danny Almonte, a pitcher from the Bronx, New York, team representing the Mid-Atlantic Region, was discovered to not be eligible because he was two years over the maximum age limit. Because of this, the Mid-Atlantic team was retroactively assessed a forfeit for each game they won in the tournament. The team&#x27;s statistics, including a perfect game thrown by Almonte, were scrubbed from the record.
* In , a team from Taiwan reached the championship match for the first time since 1996, but lost to a team from Chula Vista, California.
* In , Chicago defeated Las Vegas for the U.S. championship before losing to Seoul, South Korea, in the LLWS championship. On February 11, 2015, Chicago was stripped of its U.S. title for fielding ineligible players; it was retroactively awarded to Las Vegas.
* In , River Ridge became the first team since the expansion to 16 teams in 2001, and the second team in tournament history, to win the LLWS after losing their first game of tournament play (the first such team was Maracaibo, Venezuela, winners of the tournament).

==Media coverage==

The first broadcast of the Little League World Series on television was on ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC) in 1963. For years, only the championship game was televised. Since the late 1980s, when the tournament was reorganized, both the U.S. and international championships, the &quot;semifinals&quot;, have been shown. As the years passed, more telecasts were added on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. In 2006, 28 of the 36 games were televised on the three networks. In addition, several regional tournament games, which are qualifiers for the LLWS, are televised on ESPN during the days leading up to the LLWS.

The 2006 world championship game was to be the last telecast on ABC Sports before ESPN&#x27;s complete takeover of the sports division and name change. However, the final was postponed one day because of rain and was shown by ESPN2.

In January 2007, it was announced that ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC had extended their contract with the Little League organization through 2014. That year, every game of the LLWS was scheduled to be televised for the first time, with all but one game live on ESPN, ESPN2, or ABC. (The other game was to be available online at ESPN360, then shown on ESPN2 the next day.) In addition, a number of games were to be shown in high-definition on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC. The championship games in all other divisions, as well as the semifinals and finals of the Little League Softball World Series, was scheduled for either ESPN, ESPN2 or ESPNU.

In June 2011, it was announced that ESPN would add 17 games to its schedule on ESPN 3D.

Coverage of the qualifying games has increased substantially in the US within the past decade: as of 2018, all regional group games (with the exception of the Southwest region) are available via subscription online through the ESPN+ platform, with the last three games of each regional tournament on an ESPN network. The aforementioned Southwest regional games are aired in full on the Longhorn Network (itself owned by ESPN). The increased level of participation, competition, and publicity of the Little League World Series in recent years has established a trend in the opposite direction of many other preteen sports.

Most LLWS games are broadcast live on local radio station WRAK 1400AM, which is owned by iHeartMedia.

==Other divisions in Little League Baseball==
After discontinuing their big league divisions in 2017 due to low participation levels over the previous 15 years, seven of the remaining eleven divisions of Little League Baseball has its own World Series format (including three in girls&#x27; softball).

<text>Todd Anthony Bridges (born May 27, 1965) is an American actor. He portrayed Willis Jackson on the sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and had a recurring role as Monk on the sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris.&quot; Bridges worked as a commentator on the television series &quot;TruTV Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot; from 2008 to 2013.

==Early life==
Bridges was born on May 27, 1965, in San Francisco, California, the son of Betty Alice Pryor, an actress, director and manager, and James Bridges Sr., a talent agent. His brother Jimmy Bridges and sister Verda Bridges are also actors.

==Career==

===Television===

Bridges appeared on &quot;The Waltons&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; Season 2 Episode 5, and the landmark miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;. He was a regular on the &quot;Barney Miller&quot; spinoff &quot;Fish&quot;. It was playing Willis Jackson on the NBC/ABC sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; that made him a household name, along with those of fellow co-stars Conrad Bain, Charlotte Rae, Dana Plato, and Gary Coleman. With Rae&#x27;s death in 2018, Bridges became the last surviving original cast member. 

Bridges appeared in the 2002 special &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot; with friend Vanilla Ice, whom he defeated. In 2006, Bridges appeared as a contestant on a celebrity episode of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; but was eliminated after the first stunt. Also in 2006, he appeared as a contestant on the Fox reality show &quot;Skating with Celebrities&quot; but was eliminated in the second episode of the show because he was using roller skates instead of ice skates. In January 2007, he appeared as a member of the &quot;mob&quot; on the American version of the game show &quot;1 vs. 100&quot;. He and his wife Dori Bridges appeared in the November 14, 2007 episode of the MyNetworkTV show &quot;Decision House&quot; titled &quot;Burned Bridges.&quot; He also had a recurring role as Monk on the UPN/The CW sitcom &quot;Everybody Hates Chris&quot;.

In March 2008, Bridges appeared on &quot;TruTV Presents: World&#x27;s Dumbest...&quot;, on which he continues to appear as a frequent commentator. That October, he debuted as a contestant on &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Celebrity Championship Wrestling&quot; on CMT as a member of Team Beefcake (coached by former wrestler Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake). Bridges&#x27; wrestling persona was the character Mr. Not So Perfect. In one episode, he defeated Tonya Harding with a lead pipe. The judges praised him for his athleticism and his cunning while defeating Harding. After reaching the finals along with Butterbean and Dustin Diamond, Bridges was defeated by Dennis Rodman. In 2015, Bridges was the host of a live game show titled &quot;Lovers or Losers: The Game Show&quot; at the Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas. In 2022, Bridges was announced as a HouseGuest competing in the third season of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;.

===Music videos===
Bridges has appeared in several music videos. His first appearance was in Penny Ford&#x27;s single &quot;Change Your Wicked Ways&quot; (1984). He made a cameo in Moby&#x27;s 2002 music video for &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; and in the video for the Black Keys&#x27; 2011 single &quot;Howlin&#x27; for You.&quot;

==Personal life== 
Bridges has daughter Bo from a previous relationship.
Bridges&#x27; son Spencir Bridges (born July 15, 1998) from his marriage to former wife Dori Bridges (née Smith) is also a former child actor who appeared in the film &quot;Daddy Day Camp&quot; and an episode of &quot;iCarly&quot;.

In 1998, Bridges and his brother James saved the life of Stella Kline, a 51-year-old paraplegic woman who nearly drowned when her wheelchair rolled into a lake while she was fishing. Kline said: &quot;I was thanking God that he was there and you know, everybody&#x27;s been saying nothing but bad stuff about Todd Bridges on the news and in the papers... He has a heart of gold.&quot; Bridges remarked: &quot;We felt God put us there at the right time to save this lady&#x27;s life, because there was no one else around.&quot;

In a 2010 appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, Bridges said that he was sexually abused at age 11 by a publicist who was also a family friend.

On September 25, 2022, he married designer Bettijo Hirschi.

===Legal and criminal problems===
Bridges started smoking marijuana as a 15-year-old star on &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. In his twenties, Bridges battled a crack cocaine and methamphetamine addiction. He bought and sold drugs to support his addiction. Bridges was arrested for felony assault and cocaine possession.

In 1983, Bridges was fined $240 for carrying a concealed firearm. In 1987, he received a suspended sentence after pleading no contest when charged with making a bomb threat.

In 1989, Bridges was arrested and tried for the attempted murder of Kenneth &quot;Tex&quot; Clay, a Los Angeles-area drug dealer who prosecutors argued had been shot by Bridges. Bridges pleaded not guilty and was represented by the famous defense attorney Johnnie Cochran, who argued that Bridges was an abused minor who had been driven to drugs by an exploitative entertainment industry and was now being framed. A witness finally testified that Bridges was not present at the shooting, and Bridges was acquitted of all charges by a jury.

Bridges was arrested on December 29, 1992, on suspicion of transporting narcotics for sale and possession of a loaded firearm after Burbank, California police officers discovered methamphetamines and a loaded gun in his car. He was released on $10,000 bail. Bridges stopped using drugs on February 24, 1993, after years of use.

== Memoir ==
Bridges wrote a book, &quot;Killing Willis: From Diff&#x27;rent Strokes to the Mean Streets to the Life I Always Wanted&quot; (2008), discussing his childhood sexual abuse, drug addiction, criminal charges and efforts to establish a public identity independent of the Willis character. He appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on April 28, 2010 to discuss the troubled past that he had chronicled in his memoir.

<text>Armadale is a suburb of Perth within the City of Armadale, located on the south-eastern edge of the Perth metropolitan region. The major junction of the South Western and Albany Highways, which connect Perth with the South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia respectively, is located within the suburb. It is also the terminus of the Armadale railway line, one of five major railway lines to service Perth.

==History==
Plentiful in natural resources, the area now known as Armadale was long occupied by Aboriginal people prior to the founding of the Swan River Colony. Records of encounters with the original Aboriginal inhabitants of this district are sparse in detail, but early on there was conflict between these inhabitants and the settlers, which led to the establishment of a small garrison at Kelmscott. The township of Kelmscott was gazetted in 1830, and for the next sixty years was the administrative and social hub for those colonists who took up land between present-day Kelmscott and Byford.

Interest in settlement at Kelmscott waned soon after the township was established, the district&#x27;s inaccessibility (no road from Perth having yet been formed) and a general shortage of labour being factors militating against farming in that area. However, several large land grants had been taken up in the district, including one of over 8000 acres (Location 31) initially held by John Adams, and over the next few decades this allocated land presented a constraint to others seeking land for settlement in the area. Parts of these larger allocations were subdivided and on-sold, and smaller allocations were taken up alongside them. Thus, during the 1840s a number of farming properties were established in the foothills along the Canning River, Neerigin Brook, Wongong Brook and Beenyup Brook. Names of these early settlers included White, Stuart, Martin, Armstrong, and Mead.

In the late 1846, the Swan River Colony&#x27;s first mine was established in the area now known as Armadale. The mine was the first undertaking of the Western Australian Mining Company, formed that year, and the object was to extract lead or copper - the ores of both metals having been in evidence. Land was purchased, and over the next few years shafts were dug by contractors. There was little yield, and in 1850 shareholders resolved to wind up the operation. One of the shafts of this mining venture is still extant south of Bedfordale Hill Road.

By 1835, a road had been surveyed from Perth to Kelmscott and within a few years roads to Albany and Bunbury were also marked out enabling the establishment of overland mail services. However, it was not until 1851 that work began to properly form the road between Perth and Kelmscott. The work was assisted by the arrival of convict labour in 1852, and during the next few years the roads from Kelmscott to Albany and from Kelmscott to Pinjarra were formed. It was at the junction of the roads to Albany and Pinjarra that the township of Armadale was born when an enterprising settler saw opportunity to establish a wayside inn there, some time around 1853. The property was sold to Thomas Saw in 1856, and together with his father-in-law, Henry Gibbs, in 1856 he applied for a wayside licence to sell liquor. Their wayside inn was named the Neerigin Inn after the brook that flowed out of the Darling Range at this point. For many years the district was known as Neerigin or Narrogin, and a hotel bearing this name still stands on the site of the original wayside inn.

In 1889, the northern section of the South Western Railway was constructed from Perth to what is now Armadale, and in 1897 a station was built at this location to service the sparsely scattered population of this district. It has been claimed that the station was named &#x27;Armadale&#x27; because a name other than Neerigin had to be found to avoid confusion with the wheatbelt town of Narrogin, and that from this the town which sprang up near the station took its name. Other theories have also been put forward for the origin of the name. What is certain is that the name was not in use before the arrival of the railway.

The railway provided impetus for growth in the district, and in May 1893 local residents held a public meeting to discuss the creation of a roads board that could give attention to the maintenance and development of local roads. At this point in time, roads in the district were the responsibility of the Canning, Fremantle, Jandakot, Murray and Wandering road boards for all of whom it was an outlying and unimportant area. In October 1894, Parliament agreed to the formation of a roads board which on 12 December 1894 was gazetted as the &#x27;Kelmscott Roads Board&#x27;, later to be the Armadale-Kelmscott Roads Board (1910), the Armadale-Kelmscott Shire Council (1961), then the Armadale Town Council (1979), and now the City of Armadale (1985).

==Natural and cultural attractions==
The places listed below are Armadale&#x27;s more popular and accessible natural and cultural attractions. For a more comprehensive list of those places that have been identified as having historic cultural heritage value, refer to the City of Armadale&#x27;s Municipal Heritage Inventory (MHI). However, the MHI does not include places of natural or Aboriginal heritage value.

* Aboriginal Interpretation Centre, Champion Lakes, Kelmscott. The centre is a space where Nyoongar culture and heritage can be celebrated, discussed, strengthened and understood; and it was designed in consultation with the City of Armadale&#x27;s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Committee (ATSIAC).
*Old Jarrah Tree, Armadale Shopping City, corner Third Road and Church Avenue, Armadale. The tree is estimated to be between 400 and 800 years old and for 88 years its surrounds were the Armadale Primary School. The tree is the most ancient of recognizable features in the Armadale CBD) and is one of the more unusual places entered in the W.A. Register of Heritage Places (reference # 09009).
* Cole&#x27;s Shaft, Summit View (off Bedfordale Hill Road), Mt Richon. Remains of Western Australia&#x27;s oldest mining venture. This is a place that has been entered in the W.A. Register of Heritage Places (reference # 15263).
* Minnawarra Park, Orchard Avenue, Armadale. The park is home to the History House Museum and the accompanying historic church and school. The school building was relocated from the corner of Third Road and Church Avenue to this site in 1987, in one piece, the first such relocation of a brick structure undertaken in Australia.
*Armadale Settlers Common, Settlers Road (off Canns Road), Armadale. A place with many walk trails and a range of rare flora and fauna.
*Araluen Botanic Park, Roleystone.
*Churchman Brook Dam, Canning Dam and Wungong dam. Three major water reservoirs for the Perth metropolitan area that are of interest for their scenic qualities and engineering heritage.
*Bungendore Park and Wungong Gorge. An area of regenerated bushland of scenic, botanical, and geological interest.
* Schoenstatt Shrine, Talus Drive, Mt Richon. A replica of a place of pilgrimage in Germany.
*Birtwistle Local Studies Library, located inside the Armadale Library: Armadale Central Shopping Centre at Shop 64/10 Orchard Avenue, Armadale.
*Heritage walk from Armadale Railway Station up Jull Street to Narrogin Inn and beyond:

*&quot;Former Armadale Post Office&quot; (c.1900), south-east corner of Jull Street and Streich Avenue, Armadale. A typical country town post office designed by the PWD under the direction of architect George Temple-Poole (1856 – 1934). The earlier Post and Telegraph Office of 1898, which is now the oldest building standing in Armadale, is attached to the northern side of the building. The building now serves as the regional office of the Department of Fire and Emergency Services.
*&quot;Railway Hotel&quot; (1902), north-east corner of Jull Street and Streich Avenue, Armadale. Originally a Federation Queen Anne style building, the hotel lost its graceful two-storey verandahs in the 1960s and was &#x27;Tudorized&#x27; in the early 1980s when Armadale experienced a craze for mock Tudor buildings. The mock Tudor treatment has since been removed, but remains on the adjoining Fox and Hounds Tavern (a building of the late 1970s, formerly known as the Tudor Rose Tavern).

*&quot;Soldiers Memorial Park&quot;, Jull Street / Orchard Avenue, Armadale. The oldest landscaped park in Armadale. The brick obelisk is held to be the oldest WWI memorial in Australia, and this together with a grove of mature trees forms the setting for annual Anzac Day commemoration activities.
*&quot;Former Shire Council Offices&quot;, Jull Street, Armadale. The original 1902 office building is on the south side of the street, and on the north side are the 1967 offices which were designed by W G Bennett, Allen &amp; Allen architects.

*&quot;St Matthews Anglican Church&quot; (1904) and old manse. Designed by prominent architect Sir Joseph John Talbot Hobbs (1864-1938), this is the oldest church building in Armadale that is still being used for its intended purpose. The 1960s addition which addresses Prospect Road is by Forbes and Fitzhardinge Architects. The church is entered in the W.A. Register of Heritage Places (reference # 08774).
*&quot;Armadale Town Hall&quot; (1936). Designed by the architectural partnership of Oldham, Boas &amp; Ednie-Brown. The Town Hall replaced the Mechanics Institute hall (1898), one of the first public buildings in Armadale, which was situated where the carpark is now. The town hall is entered in the W.A. Register of Heritage Places (reference # 04669).
* Bert Tyler Vintage Machinery Museum, Jull Street, Armadale. The local visitor information centre is based here.
*&quot;Dr Colyer&#x27;s house&quot; (1952), Jull Street, Armadale. A small house in the English vernacular revival style designed by architect Marshall Clifton (1903 - 1975).
*&quot;Narrogin Inn&quot; (1936), junction of Albany and South Western Highways. A two storey hotel in the Tudor revival style designed by architect John Berkeley Fitzhardinge (1911-2008). It stands beside the site of the original 1850s wayside inn.
*&quot;Muckross Tearooms&quot;, South Western Highway. Located just above the Narrogin Inn, this building recalls the era when Perth residents would make weekend outings to Armadale in motor coaches. The building also served as a local gymnasium.
*&quot;Pioneer Village&quot;, Albany Highway, Armadale. A tourist development of the early 1980s intended to be evocative of an historic goldrush town, similar to Sovereign Hill in Ballarat. There is also a lovely playground for children.
*&quot;Elizabethan Village&quot;, Canns Road, Bedfordale. A collection of Tudor buildings in mock half-timbering built by Stanley Leopold Fowler in the late 1970s to provide an English themed heritage tourism experience. These buildings, Shakespeare&#x27;s Birthplace, Anne Hathaway&#x27;s Cottage and The Cobweb Restaurant (now the Elizabethan Village Pub) replicated original heritage buildings associated with the playwright William Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom.

== Law and crime ==
Armadale is often regarded as being dangerous and unsafe, with &quot;Perth Now&quot; calling it Perth&#x27;s most violent suburb. &quot;Red Suburbs&quot; rates Armadale a crime ranking of 70/100, where the bigger number means more crime, and also states that probability of being a victim of violent and property crime in Armadale were higher than the state and national probability. 

From July to October 2017, Armadale recorded almost 10 assaults every week. In 2017, it was the top metropolitan area for domestic assaults, and fourth for non-domestic assaults behind Fremantle, Northbridge and the Perth CBD. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decline in offences where it reached its lowest in a decade at 3,179 offences during the 2021–2022 financial year. Yet, Armadale still had the fourth highest crime rate per 100,000. Following the pandemic, it recorded 3,879 offences during the 2022–2023 financial year, in which theft was the most commonly committed crime at 1,374 offences. 

On 26 September 2019, Michelle Roberts announced the construction on a new Armadale Court House and Police Complex. It would see the relocation of the existing court house and police station into a single complex. Construction was estimated to be complete by 2022. It would be opened on 2 November 2023 and costed $88.5 million.

==Education==

Armadale, being an urban centre and transport hub for the surrounding districts, contains a variety of educational institutions. It is home to two state high schools, four state primary schools, three independent schools (one of which extends to year 12), an Australian Trades College campus and a campus of South Metropolitan TAFE (formerly Polytechnic West).

In 1899, Armadale State School was established in the Mechanics Institute Hall which was located on the present-day carpark of the Armadale Town Hall. A purpose-built school building was erected at the intersection of Church and Third Roads in 1900. This was initially a single classroom, but by 1905 a second classroom was added. The district&#x27;s population increased steadily in the first half of the 20th century, and additional classrooms were added to the school as the need presented. A Roman Catholic School, St Francis Xavier, was established uphill on Third Road in 1938. This school has recently relocated to Forrest Road, Haynes. Following WW2, the population growth was more rapid and the State saw fit to establish a regional high school in Armadale. Armadale Senior High School opened in 1955, initially only as a high school but from 1963 it catered for years 11 and 12).

From 1951, a community of Dutch migrants who were members of the Free Reformed Church settled in the district and they opened a parent run school on Robinhood Avenue in December 1957. Originally catering for years 1 to 6 and known as John Calvin School (now John Calvin Christian College), the campus evolved to incorporate a junior high school, years 11 and 12 in 1988–89, and more recently the primary school functions have relocated to the campuses established at Kelmscott and Byford.

As Armadale&#x27;s population increased, new State-run primary schools opened: Kingsley (1969), Neerigen Brook (1970), Challis (1974), and Gwynne Park (1978). In 1983, the Pioneer Village School and Dale Christian School opened, the latter having relocated to the site of the former Drive-In Cinema in Brookdale. Other State and private schools have been established in neighbouring population centres of Westfield, Kelmscott, Roleystone and Byford. Other high schools were opened at Kelmscott in the 1970s, West Armadale (Cecil Andrews High School) in 1980, and Roleystone in 1983. Cecil Andrews College is the base of the Australian Air Force Cadets Number 719 Squadron.

In 1987, Armadale Primary School relocated to a new campus on Carradine Road, its current location, and the original school site was cleared to make way for an expansion of Armadale Shopping City. In recognition of its heritage value, the 1899 school building was relocated to Minnawarra Park, its walls and roof lifted and carried to the new site intact, the first known case of a substantial brick structure relocation project undertaken in Australia. The Old Jarrah Tree which used to be in the playground near the 1905 classroom is the only in situ remains at the school&#x27;s original site. A collection of artefacts recovered from beneath the earliest parts of the school during the move are held by History House Museum and provide tangible insights into school life at Armadale during the early 1900s.

Around 2000, a TAFE Centre was built in Commerce Avenue as part of the South-East Metropolitan College of TAFE; it became a fully functioning campus in 2003 when SEMC merged into Swan TAFE, then become a campus of Polytechnic West and in 2016 merged with Challenger Institute of Technology to become South Metropolitan TAFE. In 2010, the Federal Government opened a campus of the Australian Trades College specialising in carpentry and joinery, cabinet making and electrical trades.

<text>Earl Fife was a title in the Peerage of Ireland created by letters patent dated 26 April 1759 for William Duff, 1st Baron Braco, after asserting (but not proving) his descent from Macduff, the medieval Earl of Fife. Though in the Irish peerage, the title&#x27;s name refers to Fife in Scotland.

==History==
William Duff, 1st Earl Fife, had previously been created Baron Braco, of Kilbryde in the County of Cavan, in 1735, and he was created Viscount Macduff at the same time that he was raised to the earldom. Both of these junior titles were in the Peerage of Ireland, although they referred to places in Scotland – namely Braco and Macduff in Banffshire.

Between 1790 and 1885, the Earls Fife received several additional titles in the Peerage of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom, respectively, which allowed them to sit and vote in the House of Lords. In 1790, the 2nd Earl was created Baron Fife, of the County of Fife, in the Peerage of Great Britain, but this title became extinct on his death in 1809. The 4th Earl was also created Baron Fife, of the County of Fife, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, in 1827, but this title became extinct on his death in 1857. Later that year, the 5th Earl was created Baron Skene, of Skene in the County of Aberdeen, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1885, the 6th Earl was created Earl of Fife in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

In 1889, the 6th Earl Fife was further created Duke of Fife, in Scotland, and Marquess of Macduff, in the County of Banff, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, two days after his marriage to Princess Louise of Wales, the eldest daughter of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII). When it became clear that he would have no sons, he was further created Duke of Fife and Earl of Macduff, in the County of Banff, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with a special remainder to his daughters and their heirs male.

When the 1st Duke died in 1912 without male issue, the earldom of 1759 became extinct, along with the first Dukedom of Fife, the Marquessate of Macduff, the 1885 Earldom of Fife, the Viscountcy of Macduff and the Baronies of Braco and Skene. The second Dukedom of Fife and the Earldom of Macduff passed by their special remainders to his daughters and their heirs male. Princess Alexandra of Fife thus succeeded to the second Dukedom of Fife. (See Duke of Fife for the succession to those titles.)
