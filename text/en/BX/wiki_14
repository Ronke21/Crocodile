<text>Agave amica, formerly Polianthes tuberosa, the tuberose, is a perennial plant in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae, extracts of which are used as a note in perfumery. Now widely grown as an ornamental plant, the species is native to Mexico.

==Etymology==
The common name derives from the Latin &quot;tuberosa&quot; through French &quot;tubéreuse&quot;, meaning swollen or tuberous in reference to its root system.

== Description ==
The tuberose is herbaceous, growing from underground tubers or tuberous roots. It produces offsets. The leaves are a dull green and about long and up to wide at the base. They are slightly succulent. The inflorescence is a spike, reaching up to high, with pure white waxy flowers. The flowers are tubular, with a tube up to long, separating into six flaring segments (tepals) at the end, and are strongly fragrant. There are six stamens, inserted into the tube of the flower, and a three-part stigma.

The double-flowered cultivar &#x27;The Pearl&#x27; has broader and darker leaves, and shorter flower spikes, usually reaching only . Orange-flowered forms of the species have been reported. As well due to crossing with other species there are now yellow, pink, red and greenish forms.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described for science by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, as &quot;Polianthes tuberosa&quot;. In 1790, Friedrich Kasimir Medikus moved the species to the genus &quot;Tuberosa&quot; as &quot;Tuberosa amica&quot;. Both morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that &quot;Polianthes&quot; is embedded within the larger genus &quot;Agave&quot;, and the genus is now included in a broadly circumscribed &quot;Agave&quot;. Two incorrect attempts were made to name the species when transferred to &quot;Agave&quot;. In 1999, Joachim Thiede and Urs Eggli published the name &quot;&quot;Agave tuberosa&quot;. However, Philip Miller had published this name in 1768, for the species now called &quot;Furcraea tuberosa&quot;, so it cannot be used again, and Thiede and Eggli&#x27;s name is illegitimate. In 2001, Thiede and Eggli published a replacement name (&quot;nomen novum&quot;), &quot;Agave polianthes&quot;&quot;. However, since Medikus&#x27;s &quot;Tuberosa amica&quot; is considered to be a synonym of &quot;Polianthes tuberosa&quot;, its epithet is the second oldest and according to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants should be used when the older epithet is unavailable. Hence Thiede and Eggli&#x27;s second name is superfluous, and the correct name for the species within &quot;Agave&quot; is &quot;Agave amica&quot;, as was explained by Thiede and Rafaël Govaerts when they published this combination in 2017.

==Distribution==
The tuberose is believed to be native to central and southern Mexico. It is no longer found in the wild, probably as a result of being domesticated by the Aztecs. It is currently grown in many tropical and temperate countries. &quot;Agave amica&quot; (previously &quot;Polianthes tuberosa)&quot; is the only one of the species previously known as &quot;Polianthes&quot; in commercial cultivation.

==Uses==
===In perfumery===
The overwhelming fragrance of the tuberose has been distilled for use in perfumery since the 17th century, when the flower was first transported to Europe. French Queen Marie Antoinette used a perfume called &quot;Sillage de la Reine&quot;, also called &quot;Parfum de Trianon&quot;, containing tuberose, orange blossom, sandalwood, jasmine, iris and cedar. It remains a popular floral note for perfumes, either in stand-alone Tuberose fragrances or mixed floral scents, but it generally must be used in moderation because the essence is overpowering and can become sickly to the wearer.

===Others===
In Indonesia, tuberose flowers are also used in cooking.

In Hawaii, they are one of the main flowers used in the construction of leis. Some others are plumerias, ginger, orchids, and pikake (jasmine).

== Cultivation ==

Tuberoses can be overwintered outdoors in hardiness zones 8-10. In colder zones, tuberoses are grown as summer annuals, in pots or mixed-flower borders where they can be enjoyed for their scent. To flower the plants require around 4 months of warm temperatures from the time the rhizome is planted. Gardeners usually start the rhizomes in pots in greenhouses beginning in late-winter or early spring, moving them outdoors in late spring once frost danger has passed. If they are started directly in the ground at this time, they may not bloom until September, greatly reducing the period in which their blooms may be enjoyed. Once the foliage begins to yellow in October, the leaves should be clipped, the rhizomes dug and stored in a cool, dry and dark place for the winter.

The most popular variety is a double-flowered cultivar known as &#x27;The Pearl&#x27; that grows to tall and features pale pink buds opening to cream. The more common variety is called &#x27;Mexican Single&#x27;, which, although not as decorative as &#x27;The Pearl&#x27;, makes for a longer lasting cut flower.

Tuberoses were especially beloved by Louis XIV of France, who had them planted in the hundreds in the flower beds of the Grand Trianon at Versailles so that the scent was overpowering, which no doubt helped cover the smells from the poor sanitation of the palace. They were grown in clay pots and planted directly in the ground; to keep the perfume consistently strong new specimens were rotated in, sometimes daily.

<text>A buttress is an architectural structure built against or projecting from a wall which serves to support or reinforce the wall. Buttresses are fairly common on more ancient (typically Gothic) buildings, as a means of providing support to act against the lateral (sideways) forces arising out of inadequately braced roof structures.

The term counterfort can be synonymous with buttress and is often used when referring to dams, retaining walls and other structures holding back earth.

Early examples of buttresses are found on the Eanna Temple (ancient Uruk), dating to as early as the 4th millennium BC.

==Terminology== 
In addition to flying and ordinary buttresses, brick and masonry buttresses that support wall corners can be classified according to their ground plan. A clasping or clamped buttress has an L-shaped ground plan surrounding the corner, an angled buttress has two buttresses meeting at the corner, a setback buttress is similar to an angled buttress but the buttresses are set back from the corner, and a diagonal (or &#x27;French&#x27;) buttress bisects the angle between the walls where they meet.

The gallery below shows top-down views of various types of buttress (dark grey) supporting the corner wall of a structure (light grey).

<doc id="663468" wikidata="Q776414" url="?curid=663468" title="Conservative Party (South Africa)">
<text>The Conservative Party () was a far-right South African political party that sought to preserve many aspects of apartheid in the system&#x27;s final decade, and formed the official opposition in the white-only House of Assembly in the last seven years of minority rule. It declined quickly after apartheid ended, before being merged with the Freedom Front in 2004.

==Foundation and early support==

It was formed in 1982 by 23 MPs from the ruling National Party who opposed Prime Minister PW Botha&#x27;s reforms to apartheid and power sharing proposals, that resulted in the Tricameral Parliament, which they saw as a threat to white minority rule, and the racial segregation known as Separate Development. It was led by Andries Treurnicht, a former Dutch Reformed Church minister popularly known as &#x27;Doctor No&#x27;. The CP&#x27;s English-language programme booklets from 1987 to 1989 stated that the party was established &quot;to continue the policy of self-determination after the [NP] government had exchanged self-determination&quot; (something the CP described as an &quot;infallible policy&quot;), for power-sharing. It drew support from white South Africans, mostly Afrikaners in the rural heartlands of South Africa. All members of the new party that belonged to the Afrikaner Broederbond had to leave that organization as they were not welcome anymore.

== Official opposition ==

It became the official opposition in the whites-only House of Assembly of South Africa in the elections of 6 May 1987, when it surpassed the liberal Progressive Federal Party, winning 550,000 votes. Donald Simpson, writing in the South African newspaper, &quot;The Star&quot;, went as far as to predict that the National Party would lose the next election and that the Conservative Party would become the new government of South Africa.

In the local elections of 1987 the Conservative Party won 60 municipalities out of 110 in the Transvaal, and 1 out of 4 in the Orange Free State. The Conservative Party received 45% of the Afrikaner votes and 7.5% of the English-speaking votes. It won 50% of the Afrikaner vote in the Transvaal and Orange Free State provinces in the 1989 general elections. It won 40% of the White popular vote in the Transvaal, and 45% in the Orange Free State provinces in the 1989 elections.

In the late 1980s, the party established links with the British far-right anti-communist pressure group, the Western Goals Institute.

==Opposition to negotiations to end apartheid==
In the general election of 1989, the last before non-racial elections, the party strengthened its vote to 31.52% of the white electorate and 41 seats in the House of Assembly.

The Conservative Party led the &quot;no&quot; campaign during the 1992 referendum, when white South Africans were asked to determine whether or not they supported the negotiated reforms started by the government. Apart from Treurnicht, the official Leader of the Opposition, and Clive Derby-Lewis, the Shadow Finance Minister, the &quot;no&quot; side was supported by former President P W Botha, who denounced de Klerk&#x27;s reforms as irresponsible and perilous to the stability of the country. The result was a defeat for the &quot;no&quot; side, when 68% of white voters voted &quot;yes&quot;.

Clive Derby-Lewis was found guilty in 1993 (under the emergency legislation enacted by the House of Assembly) of involvement in the assassination of South African Communist Party leader Chris Hani. In 1997, party leader Ferdi Hartzenberg testified before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that the assassination had been carried out on the party&#x27;s behalf.

==Election results==

==Post apartheid decline and dissolution==

Its support rapidly declined after majority rule in 1994. The decision not to participate in the first non-racial parliamentary elections in 1994 resulted in much of its support base defecting to the newly formed Freedom Front, another party of similar views which had been joined by one of its MPs Pieter Mulder. In the 1995–1996 municipal elections, the CP won 57 seats (out of 11 368) and a mere fraction of the votes compared to the FF and the NP.

In 2002, the Conservative Party became more active again after a largely dormant period. The party gained two seats at local level in the North West province when councillors representing a regional party joined the CP, and in the 2003 floor crossing period a Freedom Front MPL defected to the CP, giving the party one seat in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. This was followed by several more defections from FF members at regional or branch level. Party leader Hartzenberg explained that the CP had re-considered its stance not to contest elections. However, it soon became apparent that increasing its participation within the modern South African political system meant that it would merge with the larger Freedom Front, now led by Mulder, to form the Freedom Front Plus. Besides Mulder, two other former Conservative Party MPs, Corné Mulder and Pieter Groenewald, also serve as Freedom Front Plus MPs.

The merger was consolidated when its remaining two municipal councillors joined the FF+ during the September 2004 floor crossing period, thus bringing a formal end to the Conservative Party.

===Legacy===
A new political party was founded by former members of the Conservative Party on 16 April 2016, with similar beliefs, policies and logo, namely the National Conservative Party of South Africa.

<text>South Havra (; ), formerly Hevera, is an uninhabited island in the Scalloway Islands, Shetland, Scotland.

== Geography and geology ==
South Havra lies south of Burra and west of the southern peninsula of the Mainland.

The island&#x27;s rock is &quot;epidiotic syenite with undifferentiated schist and gneiss.&quot;

The soil is fairly fertile, but the lack of running water meant that, unusually for Shetland, the islanders resorted to building a windmill to grind corn.

Geological features on the island include caves and natural arches.

Little Havra is to its west.

== History ==
Olaf Sinclair, foud (a kind of magistrate) of all Shetland lived here in the 16th century.

The island&#x27;s ruined windmill is an unusual sight in the Shetland Islands, especially as some have pointed out, that the Dutch were amongst the archipelago&#x27;s most frequent visitors.

At the censuses of 1871 and 1881 South Havra had a population of 32 and 35, respectively. The island has been uninhabited since 1923. Previously the population was big enough to support a school.

<doc id="663476" wikidata="Q1504656" url="?curid=663476" title="List of NASCAR tracks">
<text>This is a list of tracks which have hosted a NASCAR race from 1948 to present. Various forms of race track have been used throughout the history of NASCAR, including purpose-built race tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and temporary tracks such as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

== NASCAR national series race tracks ==
The following is a list of race tracks currently used by NASCAR as part of its NASCAR Cup Series, NASCAR Xfinity Series, or NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series for the 2025 racing season or after.

* Bold – Indicates exhibition race.

=== Track table ===
== Defunct or inactive regular NASCAR tracks ==
The following tables list all of the tracks previously used by NASCAR at least two times. Most of these racetracks are now closed or demolished.

=== Key to tables ===
*Track: Name of the track. Either the current name of the track (as it exists today) or the last known name of the track is shown.
*Type and layout: Approximate course length (in miles), shape, and surface type. For course length, the last known measurement provided by NASCAR is shown. Note that this figure may differ in various sources depending on the method that NASCAR or other sanctioning bodies have used to measure the track.
*Location: The state (or province, for Canadian tracks) and city (or nearest city) where each track is located.
*Named race(s): For many years, specific names have been given to races during a given season as a way of marketing the event. Where these names are known, they are noted next to the seasons in which that name was used.
*Season(s): NASCAR seasons in which the track hosted an event. Note that only points-paying races are counted as part of a given series&#x27; season; tracks where additional exhibition or special races have been held are included in a separate table.
*Notes: Any additional information or clarification that may be useful. This includes details on the track&#x27;s current status, or whether the track saw further use in other NASCAR series.
*Permanently closed or demolished tracks are marked with grey background.

=== Road and street courses ===
=== Paved intermediate tracks and superspeedways ===
=== Paved short tracks ===


=== Dirt oval tracks ===


== Tracks used one time for NASCAR championship event ==
The following table shows all tracks that had only one single points paying event in NASCAR (Cup, Xfinity, Trucks) and were not visited again. Some racetracks are temporary and were built on airfields or fairgrounds or in stadiums.

== Other tracks used by NASCAR ==
This table includes tracks used by NASCAR solely for exhibition races, non-points races or other special events that were not part of any regular NASCAR season.

<doc id="663480" wikidata="Q6121072" url="?curid=663480" title="Jacquie O'Sullivan">
<text>Jacquie O&#x27;Sullivan (born 7 August 1960) is an English singer and songwriter, best known as a member of the pop group Bananarama from 1988 until 1991, replacing Siobhan Fahey, who left in early 1988. The line-up with O&#x27;Sullivan had UK top five hits with &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1988) and a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot; (1989), recorded with comedy duo French and Saunders for the charity Comic Relief. In 1989, O&#x27;Sullivan joined the group on their first world tour. Prior to Bananarama, O&#x27;Sullivan was the lead singer of the band Shillelagh Sisters.

==Career==
===Early years===
O&#x27;Sullivan joined the country/punk/rockabilly group Shillelagh Sisters in early 1983. It was &quot;a sort of a fun band, a kind of trendy band&quot;. The band name came about courtesy of their Irish connections. They released their first single &quot;Give Me My Freedom&quot; in April 1984. The band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with their record label CBS, along with differences between the band members, led to the band&#x27;s demise in late 1984. O&#x27;Sullivan later stated that she felt the records they released &quot;weren&#x27;t very good&quot;.

===1988–1991: Breakthrough with Bananarama===
In March 1988, she was chosen by Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward (who had known O&#x27;Sullivan since they were eighteen) to become a member of Bananarama, as a replacement for outgoing member Siobhan Fahey, who also approved of the choice. Bananarama&#x27;s hit streak continued with the addition of O&#x27;Sullivan. They re-recorded the vocals for the songs &quot;I Want You Back&quot; and &quot;Nathan Jones&quot; with O&#x27;Sullivan to replace versions previously recorded by Fahey. The group scored eight consecutive Top 40 hits in the UK with O&#x27;Sullivan.

She appeared on Bananarama&#x27;s fund-raising cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Help!&quot; for Comic Relief alongside comedians French and Saunders and Kathy Burke, who appeared as Lananeeneenoonoo. The record peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart in 1989. She also participated in Band Aid II&#x27;s 1989 re-recording of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s only songwriting credit with Bananarama appeared on the song &quot;Love, Truth and Honesty&quot; from the compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits Collection&quot;.

In 1991, Bananarama recorded the album &quot;Pop Life&quot;, the only full-length album on which O&#x27;Sullivan appeared. Later that year, O&#x27;Sullivan left the group, a decision that was amicable with Dallin and Woodward. O&#x27;Sullivan later stated in interviews that her role in Bananarama was that of a paid employee and that she was given no say in the creative, musical or visual direction of the group. She said that this lack of input, along with the continued emphasis by the music press that she was the &quot;new girl&quot; and constant questions of &quot;How does it feel to replace Siobhan?&quot;, contributed to her exit.

When French and Saunders parodied Bananarama in their 1988 Christmas special as &quot;Lananenenoonoo&quot;, O&#x27;Sullivan was portrayed by Kathy Burke as &quot;Kim&quot;. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s perceived lack of input into the group was used as a source of humour, with Kim ignored and dismissed in interviews and group discussions.

===1992–96: Slippry Feet===
When she left Bananarama, O&#x27;Sullivan was invited to join the disco act Slippry Feet from 1992 to 1996. They recorded songs for a record titled &quot;Freak Time Viewing&quot; and then disbanded.

===2001–present: New management, &quot;Freak Time Viewing&quot; and &quot;The Jacquie O Collection&quot;===
In 2001, O&#x27;Sullivan signed a three-album deal with AlmaFame Records, featuring unreleased songs from throughout her music career. The first release in late 2001 was the Slippry Feet album &quot;Freak Time Viewing&quot;. In early 2002, the Shillelagh Sisters album, &quot;Sham&#x27;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, was released and a third album, tentatively titled &quot;The Jacquie O Collection&quot;, featuring new songs and re-recordings of her hits with Bananarama, was announced but the record label folded and nothing was released.

In 2005, she appeared briefly on the second video clip (also called &#x27;whitey version&#x27;) of Siobhan Fahey&#x27;s song &quot;Pulsatron&quot;.

===1994–2015: Yoga teacher and massage therapist===
O&#x27;Sullivan went to India and in 1994 trained to be a yoga teacher. She continued to teach and on her travels has taught yoga all over the world. She continued with her yoga education, taking teacher training with the Prana Yoga College.

<doc id="663485" wikidata="Q2119484" url="?curid=663485" title="National Council of Provinces">
<text>The National Council of Provinces (NCOP) is the upper house of the Parliament of South Africa under the post-apartheid constitution which came into full effect in 1997. It replaced the former Senate, but is very similar to that body, and to many other upper houses of legislatures throughout the world, in that its purpose is to represent the governments of the provinces, rather than directly representing the people.

==Composition==
The NCOP consists of ninety delegates, ten delegates for each of the nine provinces regardless of the population of the province. Each province is equally represented in the NCOP.

A provincial delegation is composed of six permanent delegates and four special delegates. The party representation in the delegation must proportionally reflect the party representation in the provincial legislature, based on a formula included in the Constitution.

The permanent delegates are selected by the nine provincial legislatures. The four special delegates include the Premier of the province and three other delegates. They are nominated by each province from the members of the provincial legislature and are contingent on the subject matter being considered by the NCOP. The premier leads the province&#x27;s delegation in the NCOP, but they can choose any of the other delegates to head the delegation in their absence.

The South African Local Government Association (SALGA) is also part of the NCOP. SALGA has 10 delegates who may partake in the debates and other activities, but they do not vote.

===Current composition===
After the elections of 29 May 2024, the new provincial legislatures met on 13 and 14 June 2024 to elect NCOP delegations. The first sitting of the NCOP took place on 15 June 2024. The delegations elected are described in the following table.
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Population per delegate===
==Role in the legislative process==

The NCOP may consider, amend, propose amendments to, or reject the legislation. It must consider all national bills, and also has the power to initiate legislation in the functional areas where Parliament and the provincial legislatures have concurrent legislative power.

The NCOP has four decision-making mechanisms depending on the type of bill:
*Section 74 bills; they may not deal with any matters other than constitutional amendments and matters related to the amendments.

He served as chairperson from 1997 to 1999. The chairperson is elected from the permanent delegates for a five-year term. The election of the chairperson is presided over by the Chief Justice of South Africa. The Chief Justice can, however, designate another judge to preside. The chairperson, in turn, presides over the other elections that takes place in the chamber. The legislative body also elects a permanent deputy chairperson. A second deputy chairperson is elected for a one-year term. The position rotates between the nine provinces, enabling the provinces to have its members elected second deputy chairpersos.,

<text>Richard Rush (August 29, 1780 – July 30, 1859) was an American lawyer, politician and diplomat who served as the 8th United States Attorney General from 1814 to 1817 and the 8th United States Secretary of the Treasury from 1825 to 1829. He served as John Quincy Adams&#x27;s running mate on the National Republican ticket during the 1828 United States presidential election.

He served as Attorney General of Pennsylvania in 1811 and as Comptroller of the Treasury during the James Madison administration. Rush became one of Madison&#x27;s closest advisers during the War of 1812 and Madison elevated him to United States Attorney General in 1814. Rush remained in that position after James Monroe took office. He served as the acting Secretary of State briefly in 1817 and negotiated the Rush–Bagot Treaty, which limited naval forces on the Great Lakes.

Rush served as the ambassador to Britain from 1818 to 1825. He negotiated the Treaty of 1818 which set the boundary between the U.S. and Canada and had discussions with George Canning that led to the announcement of the Monroe Doctrine. He served as minister to France from 1847 to 1849. He helped establish and served on the board of regents for the Smithsonian Institution.

==Early life and education==
Rush was born on August 29, 1780, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the second son, and third child, of Benjamin Rush and Julia (Stockton) Rush, daughter of Richard Stockton and Annis Boudinot Stockton. He entered the College of New Jersey (now known as Princeton University) at the age of 14, and graduated in 1797 as the youngest member of his class. He studied law in the practice of William Lewis and was admitted to the bar in 1800.

Rush married Catherine Eliza Murray on the fall of 1809. They were the parents of eleven children including the lawyer and writer Benjamin Rush and Union Army colonel Richard H. Rush.

==Career==
As a lawyer, Rush first gained attention with a speech he gave which condemned the British naval attack during the Chesapeake-Leopard affair. In 1811 he was appointed Attorney General of Pennsylvania. He successfully acquitted William Duane in a libel suit brought forth by the Pennsylvania Governor Thomas McKean. His popularity prompted an offer to run for Congress but he declined. In November 1811, President James Madison appointed Rush Comptroller of the Treasury.

From the position as Comptroller of the treasury, albeit a subordinate position, Rush functioned as one of President Madison&#x27;s closest friends and confidential advisors throughout the War of 1812. Rush was on the field of battle along with Madison during the Battle of Bladensburg. He was one of the War Hawks who advocated war with Britain. In 1814 Madison offered Rush the choice of Secretary of the Treasury or Attorney General of the United States, and Rush chose Attorney General. With his appointment as Attorney General, Rush became the youngest person to serve in that office. Rush served as United States Attorney General from 1814 to 1817. At this time the attorney generalship was a part-time position, and so Rush also maintained his private law practice while in this office. He edited &quot;Laws of the United States&quot;, which codified all the federal statutes implemented between 1789 and 1815.

He was acting Secretary of State briefly in 1817. During this time Rush concluded the Rush-Bagot Convention, which demilitarized the Canadian boundary on the Great Lakes.

In October 1817, Rush was appointed Minister to Britain to succeed John Quincy Adams, who had taken the position of Secretary of State upon his return. He remained in Britain for almost eight years, and negotiated a number of important treaties, including the Treaty of 1818.

In 1823, Rush negotiated with George Canning over British proposals that the two countries issue a joint declaration against French involvement in Spain&#x27;s rebelling American colonies, but Britain would not agree to American demands for recognition of the newly independent republics, leading to the separate American declaration of the Monroe Doctrine. He wrote about his experience as Minister to Britain in &quot;A Residence in the Court of St. James&quot;.
Upon the election of John Quincy Adams in 1825, Rush (having made a study of Britain, and the British Navy in particular, while he was there) desired to become the Secretary of the Navy. Adams, however, immediately nominated him for the post of 8th Secretary of the Treasury, which he accepted.

In 1828, he was a candidate for Vice President on the re-election ticket with John Quincy Adams, but was defeated.

In 1829, he went overseas at the behest of the cities of Alexandria, Virginia, and Georgetown, to secure funds for the construction of a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Ohio River.

In 1836, President Andrew Jackson sent him to England as Commissioner to secure for the United States the legacy left the government by James Smithson. He was successful in this undertaking, bringing to this country the sum of $508,318.46, which would eventually be used to establish the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. Rush later became one of the first regents of the institution.

After a short time with the Anti-Masonic Party, in the later 1830s Rush became a member of the Democratic Party. He was opposed to anti-slavery sentiments because he believed they threatened the stability of the Union.

In 1847, Richard Rush was appointed as Minister to France by President James K. Polk. When his negotiations were interrupted by the overthrow of King Louis-Philippe, he was among the first foreign diplomats to recognize the new French Second Republic.

===Societies===
Rush was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. In 1817, Rush elected a member of the American Philosophical Society. During the 1820s, Rush was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions.

==Death and legacy==
He died in Philadelphia on July 30, 1859, and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

Five United States Coast Guard vessels were named in his honor:
*USRC &quot;Richard Rush&quot; 1831 Morris-Taney class cutter
*USGC &quot;Richard Rush&quot; 1874 Dexter-class cutter
*USRC &quot;Rush&quot; 1885 revenue cutter,
*USS &quot;Rush II (WSC-151)&quot; 1927 cutter
*USCGC &quot;Rush&quot; (WHEC-723) 1969 Hamilton-class cutter

The USCGC &quot;Rush (WMSM-918)&quot; Heritage-class cutter is under construction and scheduled for delivery in 2026.

<doc id="663488" wikidata="Q7902840" url="?curid=663488" title="Utility cooperative">
<text>A utility cooperative is a type of cooperative that is tasked with the delivery of a public utility such as electricity, water or telecommunications to its members. Profits are either reinvested for infrastructure or distributed to members in the form of &quot;patronage&quot; or &quot;capital credits&quot;, which are dividends paid on a member&#x27;s investment in the cooperative.

Each customer is a member and owner of the business. This means that all members have equal individual authority, unlike investor-owned utilities where the extent of individual authority is governed by the number of shares held. Like cooperatives operating in other sectors, many utility cooperatives conduct their affairs according to a set of ideals based on the Rochdale Principles. Some utility cooperatives respect the seventh principle, &quot;Concern for community&quot;, through &quot;Operation Roundup&quot; schemes, whereby members can voluntarily have their bill rounded to the next currency unit (e.g. $55.37 becomes $56), with the difference (e.g. 63¢) distributed to a fund for local charities.

Many such cooperatives exist in the rural United States and were created by the New Deal to bring electric power and telephone service to rural areas, when the nearest investor-owned utility would not provide service since it believes that there would be insufficient revenue to justify the capital expenditures required. Many electric cooperatives have banded together to form their own wholesale power cooperatives, often called G&amp;Ts for &quot;generation and transmission&quot;, to supply their member-owners with electricity.

Many utility cooperatives strive to bring the best service at the lowest possible cost, but the high cost of maintaining the infrastructure that is needed to cover large rural areas without the support of large cities as a rich customer base often causes high prices. However, a few such co-ops have managed to tap into urban markets because of growth into previously rural territory served by the co-ops, and they have proven to be very cost-effective. More recently, established energy co-ops have offered with national coverage. Co-operative Energy in the United Kingdom and Enercoop in France are examples of consumer cooperatives. Other co-ops have formed to concentrate on the generation of renewable energy, especially wind energy co-operatives.

== Electric cooperatives ==
===North America===


There are two types of electric cooperatives: distribution cooperatives and generation and transmission (G&amp;T) cooperatives. Distribution electric cooperatives serve end-users, such as residences and businesses, who make up their membership. Generation and transmission cooperatives typically sell wholesale power to distribution cooperatives and are cooperative federations owned by their member co-ops.

====Naming====
Most electric cooperatives in the United States include the phrase &quot;electric cooperative&quot; in their name, which makes it easy to identify their organization. Most cooperatives have a name that identifies or explains some aspect of their service area. For example, Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative in Texas is named after the Bluebonnet which grows naturally in its service area. Lyntegar Electric Cooperative, also in Texas, is named for the three original counties that came together to organize it, Lynn County, Terry County, and Garza County, and A&amp;N Electric Cooperative in Virginia, is named so because it serves Accomack County and Northampton County. For years after the Rural Electrification Administration was established, many rural residents in the US called cooperatives &quot;REA&quot;, regardless of their actual name, and would in turn say they were served by REA instead of the cooperative name if asked who their electric provider was. Today, some cooperatives, either by choice or by the guidance of state charter laws, carry a variation of the cooperative name. These include:

*Electric Cooperative Association
*Electric Membership Cooperative (EMC) - used in many states, such as Indiana, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama
*Electric Power Association (EPA) - mainly used in Mississippi
*Energy Cooperative
*Power Cooperative
*Rural Electric Association
*Rural Electric Cooperative
*Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation (RECC) - mainly used in Kentucky
*Rural Electric Membership Corporation (REMC)

Several states have another variation of the utility cooperative, known as Public Power Districts (PPDs) in Nebraska and Public Utility Districts (PUDs) in Oregon and Washington. In both cases, the laws that created these &quot;quasi-cooperative&quot; utilities were created with the specific intent of taking over territory being served by privately owned power companies in those states. Nebraska&#x27;s conversion from a mixture of power companies serving the state to a public power empire spanned the 1940s (the last privately owned utility line into the state being cut on December 29, 1949), with the creation of the PUDs in the Pacific Northwest starting about the same time and continuing with varying degrees of success over the following two decades. The key difference between a PPD/PUD and a cooperative is that PPDs/PUDs are publicly controlled by residents of a state or local area and run more like a municipal power system than a cooperative system. A cooperative is owned and operated by the customers they serve within their designated service area. Cooperative owners have voting rights to elect the cooperative&#x27;s board members each year and generally have more say in the operations than other utility forms.

==== Peer associations ====
Small cooperatives often band together to achieve economies of scale, share expertise and stand together on regulatory issues. There are several statewide (and in Canada, province-wide) associations of cooperatives, including Kentucky and Nova Scotia. A cooperative of cooperatives, in which several smaller level cooperatives come together to form a bigger higher level cooperative, is called the secondary cooperative. Secondary cooperative is different from the association. Cooperative of secondary cooperative is called tertiary cooperatives. For example, each village may have a village level cooperative. Several village cooperatives may form a district level secondary cooperative in which village level cooperatives have a share. Several district level cooperatives may form a state level tertiary cooperative, and so on.

===Europe===
In 2013, REScoop, a European federation of energy co-operatives, both producers&#x27; and consumers&#x27;, was launched. It has 11 members in seven countries.

In the UK, Co-operative Energy was established in 2010 by Midcounties Co-operative and supplies electricity and gas across the country.

===Philippines===

Electricity in most provinces of the Philippines are served by cooperatives, and all belong to the distribution sector, which serve the end customers, who own the cooperative themselves. Electric cooperatives in the Philippines are overseen by the government through the National Electrification Administration (NEA), and rates set by the cooperatives are regulated by the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), an agency belonging to the Department of Energy (DOE).

== Telephone cooperatives ==
Telephone cooperatives have today expanded beyond their historical role of providing fixed line telephone services, by also offering broadband and often cable TV services (via DSL, coaxial cable or optical fibre), and mobile/wireless services.

===United Kingdom===
The UK has a single telephone co-operative, The Phone Co-op, which provides fixed, mobile telephone and internet services, including web hosting and broadband. It is 100% owned by its customer-members who democratically control the business and who share in its profits. The co-op is a social enterprise and was awarded the title of UK customer-facing social enterprise of the year 2015 at the UK Social Enterprise Awards. The business is a living wage employer and is accredited to hold the Fair Tax Mark. It has over 30,000 customers.

===United States===

There are approximately 260 telephone cooperatives in the US, together employing approximately 23,000 and annual revenues of $3.9B. Many were formed during the New Deal in the 1930s, but some date to the turn of the 20th century. Most operate only one or a small number of exchanges, typically as an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (ILEC), but some have become regional players through merger and now operate as Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC).

<text>Endre Szemerédi (; born August 21, 1940) is a Hungarian-American mathematician and computer scientist, working in the field of combinatorics and theoretical computer science. He has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He also holds a professor emeritus status at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Szemerédi has won prizes in mathematics and science, including the Abel Prize in 2012. He has made a number of discoveries in combinatorics and computer science, including Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, the Szemerédi regularity lemma, the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem, the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem and the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem.

==Early life==
Szemerédi was born in Budapest. Since his parents wished him to become a doctor, Szemerédi enrolled at a college of medicine, but he dropped out after six months (in an interview he explained it: &quot;I was not sure I could do work bearing such responsibility.&quot;). He studied at the Faculty of Sciences of the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest and received his PhD from Moscow State University. His adviser was Israel Gelfand. This stemmed from a misspelling, as Szemerédi originally wanted to study with Alexander Gelfond.

==Academic career==
Szemerédi has been the State of New Jersey Professor of computer science at Rutgers University since 1986. He has held visiting positions at Stanford University (1974), McGill University (1980), the University of South Carolina (1981–1983) and the University of Chicago (1985–1986).

==Work==
Endre Szemerédi has published over 200 scientific articles in the fields of discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, arithmetic combinatorics and discrete geometry. He is best known for his proof from 1975 of an old conjecture of Paul Erdős and Pál Turán: if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This is now known as Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem. One of the lemmas introduced in his proof is now known as the Szemerédi regularity lemma, which has become an important lemma in combinatorics, being used for instance in property testing for graphs and in the theory of graph limits.

He is also known for the Szemerédi–Trotter theorem in incidence geometry and the Hajnal–Szemerédi theorem and Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem in graph theory. Miklós Ajtai and Szemerédi proved the corners theorem, an important step toward higher-dimensional generalizations of the Szemerédi theorem. With Ajtai and János Komlós he proved the &quot;ct&quot;2/log &quot;t&quot; upper bound for the Ramsey number &quot;R&quot;(3,&quot;t&quot;), and constructed a sorting network of optimal depth. With Ajtai, Václav Chvátal, and Monroe M. Newborn, Szemerédi proved the famous Crossing Lemma, that a graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices and &quot;m&quot; edges, where has at least crossings. With Paul Erdős, he proved the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem on the number of sums and products in a finite set. With Wolfgang Paul, Nick Pippenger, and William Trotter, he established a separation between nondeterministic linear time and deterministic linear time, in the spirit of the infamous P versus NP problem.

==Awards and honors==
Szemerédi has won numerous awards and honors for his contribution to mathematics and computer science. A few of them are listed here:
* Honorary John von Neumann Professor (2021) 
* Grünwald Prize (1967)
* Grünwald Prize (1968)
* Rényi Prize (1973)
* George Pólya Prize for Achievement in Applied Combinatorics (SIAM), (1975)
* Prize of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1979)
* State of New Jersey Professorship (1986)
* The Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research (AMS), (2008)
* The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics for deep and pioneering work from 1975 on arithmetic progressions in subsets of the integers (2008)
* The Széchenyi Prize of the Hungarian Republic for his many fundamental contributions to mathematics and computer science (2012)
* The Abel Prize for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science (2012)
* Hungarian Order of Saint Stephen(2020)

Szemerédi is a corresponding member (1982), and member (1987) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and a member (2010) of the United States National Academy of Sciences. He was elected to the Academia Europaea in 2022. He is also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and a permanent research fellow at the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics in Budapest. He was the Fairchild Distinguished Scholar at the California Institute of Technology in 1987–88.
He is an honorary doctor of Charles University in Prague.
He was the lecturer in the Forty-Seventh Annual DeLong Lecture Series at the University of Colorado. He is also a recipient of the Aisenstadt Chair at CRM, University of Montreal. In 2008 he was the Eisenbud Professor at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California.

In 2012, Szemerédi was awarded the Abel Prize &quot;for his fundamental contributions to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, and in recognition of the profound and lasting impact of these contributions on additive number theory and ergodic theory&quot; The Abel Prize citation also credited Szemerédi with bringing combinatorics to the centre-stage of mathematics and noted his place in the tradition of Hungarian mathematicians such as George Pólya who emphasized a problem-solving approach to mathematics. Szemerédi reacted to the announcement by saying that &quot;It is not my own personal achievement, but recognition for this field of mathematics and Hungarian mathematicians,&quot; that gave him the most pleasure.

==Conferences==
On August 2–7, 2010, the Alfréd Rényi Institute of Mathematics and the János Bolyai Mathematical Society organized a conference in honor of the 70th birthday of Endre Szemerédi.

Prior to the conference a volume of the Bolyai Society Mathematical Studies Series, &quot;An Irregular Mind&quot;, a collection of papers edited by Imre Bárány and József Solymosi, was published to celebrate Szemerédi&#x27;s achievements on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Another conference devoted to celebrating Szemerédi&#x27;s work is
the Third Abel Conference: A Mathematical Celebration of Endre Szemerédi.

==Personal life==
Szemerédi is married to Anna Kepes; they have five children, Andrea, Anita, Peter, Kati, and Zsuzsi.

<text>Load Records was an American experimental music-oriented independent record label based out of Providence, Rhode Island. &quot;Load Records might possibly be in possession of the world&#x27;s most challenging record roster,&quot; writes Mark Hensch of Thrash Pit. &quot;Rounded out by some of the most uncompromising noise/avant-garde/experimental artists in all of music&#x27;s sordid underbelly, Load has always prided itself on remaining outside of common taste and maybe even common sense.&quot;

==History==
Load Records was started by Ben McOsker in order to put a 7-inch record out for the band Boss Fuel. The label quickly became the most prominent source for noise music coming out of Providence, Rhode Island - loosely functioning in the same way that Sub Pop served grunge out of Seattle in the early 1990s. &quot;Ben McOsker got into the business of running a label on a whim,&quot; said Stylus Magazine, &quot;and now, after more than ten years of operation, Load Records has become one of the preeminent names in noise music. By signing acts like Lightning Bolt, Sightings and Noxagt, McOsker has expanded the notions of noise and helped bring numerous Providence bands to the ears of discerning listeners.&quot; Some claim McOsker and Mullen have released some of the most exciting noise/experimental music of the early 2000s, including music from Lightning Bolt, Neon Hunk, Metalux, Noxagt, and Friends Forever. Others have attributed a cookie-cutter aesthetic to the label, mostly in terms of the masks/costumes worn by a number of the bands. However, later records released by Load have run the gamut from strict noise-based squeal of Prurient and the Yellow Swans. Load also features a number of bands operating in a more metal vein such as Khanate, OvO, Necronomitron, and Brainbombs.

The music of Load Records is popularized and reviewed through national zines like Blastitude, Arthur, and Dead Angel.

On April 11, 2017, the label revealed they would be coming to an end: &quot;After 24 years of Load Records its time to move on. Will be contacting bands to arrange next steps. Thanks for a great ride.&quot;

<text>Norman Alexander MacCaig (14 November 1910 – 23 January 1996) was a Scottish poet and teacher. His poetry, in modern English, is known for its humour, simplicity of language and great popularity.

==Life==
Norman Alexander MacCaig was born at 15 East London Street, Edinburgh, to Robert McCaig (1880–1950?), a chemist from Dumfriesshire, and Joan née MacLeod (1879–1959), from Scalpay in the Outer Hebrides. He was their fourth child and only son. He attended the Royal High School and in 1928 went to the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1932 with a degree in classics. He divided his time, for the rest of his life, between his native city and Assynt in the Scottish Highlands.

During the Second World War MacCaig registered as a conscientious objector, a move that many at the time criticised. Douglas Dunn has suggested that MacCaig&#x27;s career later suffered as a result of his outspoken pacifism, although this is disputed. For the early part of his working life, he was employed as a school teacher in primary schools. In 1967, he was appointed Fellow in Creative Writing at Edinburgh. He became a reader in poetry in 1970 at the University of Stirling. He spent his summer holidays in Achmelvich, and Inverkirkaig, near Lochinver.

His first collection, &quot;Far Cry&quot;, was published in 1943. He continued to publish throughout his lifetime and was prolific in the amount that he produced. After his death a still larger collection of unpublished poems was found. MacCaig often gave public readings of his work in Edinburgh and elsewhere; these were extremely popular and for many people were the first introduction to the poet. His life is also noteworthy for the friendships he had with a number of other Scottish poets, such as Hugh MacDiarmid and Douglas Dunn. He described his own religious beliefs as &quot;Zen Calvinism&quot;, a comment typical of his half-humorous, half-serious approach to life.

==Work==
===Early===
MacCaig&#x27;s first two books were deeply influenced by the New Apocalypse movement of the thirties and forties, one of a number of literary movements that were constantly coalescing, evolving and dissolving at that time. Later he was to all but disown these works, dismissing them as obscure and meaningless. His poetic rebirth took place with the publication of &quot;Riding Lights&quot; in 1955. It was a complete contrast to his earlier works, being strictly formal, metrical, rhyming and utterly lucid. The timing of the publication was such that he could have been associated with The Movement, a poetic grouping of poets at just that time. Indeed many of the forms and themes of his work fitted with the ideas of The Movement but he remained separate from that group, perhaps on account of his Scottishness—all of the Movement poets were English. One label that has been attached to MacCaig and one that he seemed to enjoy (as an admirer of John Donne) is Metaphysical.

===Later===

In his later years he relaxed some of the formality of his work, losing the rhymes and strict metricality but always strove to maintain the lucidity. He became a free verse poet with the publication of &quot;Surroundings&quot; in 1966. Seamus Heaney described his work as &quot;an ongoing education in the marvellous possibilities of lyric poetry&quot;. Ted Hughes wrote, &quot;whenever I meet his poems, I&#x27;m always struck by their undated freshness, everything about them is alive, as new and essential, as ever&quot;. Another poet, beside Donne, whom MacCaig claimed was a great influence on his work was Louis MacNeice. Although he never lost his sense of humour, much of his very late work, following the death of his wife in 1990, is more sombre in tone. The poems appear to be full of heartbreak but they never become pessimistic.

An example of this is his poem &quot;Praise of a Man&quot; which was quoted by Gordon Brown in the eulogy he gave at the funeral of Robin Cook in 2005:&lt;poem&gt;
The beneficent lights dim
but don&#x27;t vanish.
The razory edges
dull, but still cut.
He&#x27;s gone:
but you can see
his tracks still, in the snow of the world.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In probability theory and statistics, the triangular distribution is a continuous probability distribution with lower limit &quot;a&quot;, upper limit &quot;b&quot;, and mode &quot;c&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; and &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;c&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;.

==Special cases==
===Mode at a bound===
The distribution simplifies when &quot;c&quot; = &quot;a&quot; or &quot;c&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. For example, if &quot;a&quot; = 0, &quot;b&quot; = 1 and &quot;c&quot; = 1, then the PDF and CDF become:

:formula_8

:formula_9

====Distribution of the absolute difference of two standard uniform variables====
This distribution for &quot;a&quot; = 0, &quot;b&quot; = 1 and &quot;c&quot; = 0 is the distribution of &quot;X&quot; = |&quot;X&quot;1 − &quot;X&quot;2|, where &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 are two independent random variables with standard uniform distribution.

:formula_10

===Symmetric triangular distribution===
The symmetric case arises when &quot;c&quot; = (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) / 2.
In this case, an alternate form of the distribution function is:

:formula_11

====Distribution of the mean of two standard uniform variables====

This distribution for &quot;a&quot; = 0, &quot;b&quot; = 1 and &quot;c&quot; = 0.5—the mode (i.e., the peak) is exactly in the middle of the interval—corresponds to the distribution of the mean of two standard uniform variables, that is, the distribution of &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;X&quot;1 + &quot;X&quot;2) / 2, where &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2 are two independent random variables with standard uniform distribution in [0, 1]. It is the case of the Bates distribution for two variables.

:formula_12

:formula_13

:formula_14

==Generating random variates==
Given a random variate &quot;U&quot; drawn from the uniform distribution in the interval (0, 1), then the variate

:formula_15

where formula_16, has a triangular distribution with parameters formula_17 and formula_18. This can be obtained from the cumulative distribution function.

==Use of the distribution==

The triangular distribution is typically used as a subjective description of a population for which there is only limited sample data, and especially in cases where the relationship between variables is known but data is scarce (possibly because of the high cost of collection).
It is based on a knowledge of the minimum and maximum and an &quot;inspired guess&quot; as to the modal value. For these reasons, the triangle distribution has been called a &quot;lack of knowledge&quot; distribution.

===Business simulations===
The triangular distribution is therefore often used in business decision making, particularly in simulations. Generally, when not much is known about the distribution of an outcome (say, only its smallest and largest values), it is possible to use the uniform distribution. But if the most likely outcome is also known, then the outcome can be simulated by a triangular distribution. See for example under corporate finance.

===Project management===
The triangular distribution, along with the PERT distribution, is also widely used in project management (as an input into PERT and hence critical path method (CPM)) to model events which take place within an interval defined by a minimum and maximum value.

===Audio dithering===
The symmetric triangular distribution is commonly used in audio dithering, where it is called TPDF (triangular probability density function).

*Central limit theorem — The triangle distribution often occurs as a result of adding two uniform random variables together. In other words, the triangle distribution is often (not always) the result of the first iteration of the central limit theorem summing process (i.e. formula_19). In this sense, the triangle distribution can occasionally occur naturally. If this process of summing together more random variables continues (i.e. formula_20), then the distribution will become increasingly bell-shaped.
*Irwin–Hall distribution — Using an Irwin–Hall distribution is an easy way to generate a triangle distribution.
*Bates distribution — Similar to the Irwin–Hall distribution, but with the values rescaled back into the 0 to 1 range. Useful for computation of a triangle distribution which can subsequently be rescaled and shifted to create other triangle distributions outside of the 0 to 1 range.

<doc id="663498" wikidata="Q1058454" url="?curid=663498" title="Dynamic compilation">
<text>Dynamic compilation is a process used by some programming language implementations to gain performance during program execution. Although the technique originated in Smalltalk, the best-known language that uses this technique is Java. Since the machine code emitted by a dynamic compiler is constructed and optimized at program runtime, the use of dynamic compilation enables optimizations for efficiency not available to statically-compiled programs (i.e. those compiled by a so-called &quot;batch compiler&quot;, as written below) except through code duplication or metaprogramming.

Runtime environments using dynamic compilation typically have programs run slowly for the first few minutes, and then after that, most of the compilation and recompilation is done and it runs quickly. Due to this initial performance lag, dynamic compilation is undesirable in certain cases. In most implementations of dynamic compilation, some optimizations that could be done at the initial compile time are delayed until further compilation at run-time, causing further unnecessary slowdowns. Just-in-time compilation is a form of dynamic compilation.

==Incremental compilation==
A closely related technique is incremental compilation. An incremental compiler is used in POP-2, POP-11, Forth, some versions of Lisp, e.g. Maclisp and at least one version of ML (Poplog ML).

This requires the compiler for the programming language to be part of the runtime system. In consequence, source code can be read in at any time, from the terminal, from a file, or possibly from a data-structure constructed by the running program, and translated into a machine code block or function (which may replace a previous function of the same name), which is then immediately available for use by the program. Because of the need for speed of compilation during interactive development and testing, the compiled code is likely not to be as heavily optimised as code produced by a standard &#x27;batch compiler&#x27;, which reads in source code and produces object files that can subsequently be linked and run. However an incrementally compiled program will typically run much faster than an interpreted version of the same program. Incremental compilation thus provides a mixture of the benefits of interpreted and compiled languages. To aid portability it is generally desirable for the incremental compiler to operate in two stages, namely first compiling to some intermediate platform-independent language, and then compiling from that to machine code for the host machine. In this case porting requires only changing the &#x27;back end&#x27; compiler. Unlike dynamic compilation, as defined above, incremental compilation does not involve further optimisations after the program is first run.

<text>William Angus McIlvanney (25 November 1936 – 5 December 2015) was a Scottish novelist, short story writer, and poet. He was known as Gus by friends and acquaintances. McIlvanney was a champion of gritty yet poetic literature; his works &quot;Laidlaw&quot;, &quot;The Papers of Tony Veitch&quot;, and &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; are all known for their portrayal of Glasgow in the 1970s. He is regarded as &quot;the father of &quot;Tartan Noir&quot;&quot; and as Scotland&#x27;s Camus.

==Biography==
McIlvanney was born in Kilmarnock on 25 November 1936, the youngest of four children of a former miner, and attended school at Kilmarnock Academy. He went on to study English at the University of Glasgow and graduated with an MA in 1960. McIlvanney then worked as an English teacher until 1975, when he left the position of assistant headmaster at Greenwood Academy to pursue his writing career. The writer&#x27;s elder brother was the sports journalist Hugh McIlvanney. His son, Liam McIlvanney, is also an author of the crime genre.

In addition to his literary career, McIlvanney wrote regularly for newspapers, and was a writer and narrator of the BBC Scotland football documentary &quot;Only a Game?&quot; in 1986.

McIlvanney held onto his strong socialist views throughout his life. In common with many from working-class backgrounds in Scotland, he was strongly opposed to Thatcherism. Later, he became disappointed by the shift of Labour towards the centre during the New Labour era under Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and by 2014, he had ultimately come to hesitantly feel that Scottish independence might be the best political solution.

William McIlvanney died on 5 December 2015 at the age of 79, after a short illness. Following his death, a number of public figures, including SNP MSP Nicola Sturgeon, authors Ian Rankin and Irvine Welsh, paid tribute noting both his inspirational writing and his likeable and gentlemanly personality. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; obituary noted: &quot;Many authors are admired. Many are respected. Few are loved as he was, for what they are as well as for what they have written.&quot;

==Writing==
His first book, &quot;Remedy is None&quot;, was published in 1966 and won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize in 1967. &quot;Docherty&quot; (1975), a portrait of a miner whose courage and endurance is tested during the depression, won the Whitbread Novel Award.

&quot;The Big Man&quot; (1985) is the story of Dan Scoular, an unemployed man who turns to bare-knuckle fighting to make a living. Both novels feature typical McIlvanney characters – tough, often violent, men locked in a struggle with their own nature and background. The novel was adapted into a film in 1990 directed by David Leland, starring Liam Neeson, and featuring Billy Connolly.

His novel, &quot;The Kiln&quot; (1996), is the story of Tam Docherty, the grandson of the hero of &quot;Docherty&quot;. It won the Saltire Society Scottish Book of the Year Award.

&quot;Laidlaw&quot; (1977), &quot;The Papers of Tony Veitch&quot; (1983) and &quot;Strange Loyalties&quot; (1991) are crime novels featuring Inspector Jack Laidlaw. &quot;Laidlaw&quot; is considered to be the first book of Tartan Noir, despite the author&#x27;s calling the term &quot;Tartan Noire&quot;.

McIlvanney was also a poet, and wrote &quot;The Longships in Harbour: Poems&quot; (1970), &quot; In Through the Head&quot; (1988) and &quot;Surviving the Shipwreck&quot; (1991), which also contains pieces of journalism, including an essay about T. S. Eliot. McIlvanney wrote a screenplay based on his short story &quot;Dreaming&quot; (published in &quot;Walking Wounded&quot; in 1989) which was filmed by BBC Scotland in 1990 and won a BAFTA.

From April 2013, McIlvanney&#x27;s writing was regularly published on his own website, which features personal, reflective and topical writing, as well as examples of his journalism.

His final novel, &quot;The Dark Remains&quot;, was completed by Ian Rankin and released in September 2021.

The McIlvanney Prize, awarded by Bloody Scotland, is named after him.

<text>Papa Little (; Old Norse: &quot;Papey Litla&quot;, meaning &quot;the little island of the priests&quot;) is an island in St Magnus Bay, Shetland, Scotland.

The island lies at the head of Aith Voe in north west Mainland, Shetland, south of Muckle Roe. It is largely peat-covered and has been uninhabited since the 1840s.

Its name means &quot;little island of the papar&quot; (as distinct from Papa Stour), who were Gaelic hermits or Culdees found as far north as Iceland.

<doc id="663508" wikidata="Q156322" url="?curid=663508" title="Katie Melua">
<text>Ketevan Katie Melua (; , ; born 16 September 1984) is a British singer and songwriter. She was born in Kutaisi, Georgia and raised in Belfast and London. Under the management of composer Mike Batt, she was signed to the small Dramatico record label. She made her musical debut in 2003 and within three years, she was the United Kingdom&#x27;s best-selling female artist as well as Europe&#x27;s highest-selling female artist.

In November 2003, Melua released her first album, &quot;Call Off the Search&quot;, which reached the top of the United Kingdom album charts and sold 1.8 million copies in its first five months of release. Her second album, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, was released in September 2005, and has gone platinum (one million units sold) four times. She released her third studio album &quot;Pictures&quot; in October 2007.

According to the Sunday Times Rich List 2008, Melua had amassed a fortune of £18 million, making her the seventh-richest British musician under the age of 30.

She possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range.

==Early life==

Ketevan Melua was born on 16 September 1984 to Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She is also partly of Canadian and Russian ancestry. She was baptised into the Georgian Orthodox Church. Melua spent her first years with her grandparents in Tbilisi before moving with her parents and brother to the city of Batumi, where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, she sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five flights of stairs to her family&#x27;s flat and according to her, &quot;Now, when I&#x27;m staying in luxurious hotels, I think back to those days&quot;.

In 1993, the family emigrated to Belfast, Northern Ireland in the aftermath of the Georgian Civil War. Her father, a heart surgeon, took up a position at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The family remained in Belfast, living close to Falls Road, until she was 14. During her time in Northern Ireland, she attended the Roman Catholic schools St Catherine&#x27;s Primary School and Dominican College, Fortwilliam, while her younger brother attended State schools.

The family then moved to Sutton, London and some time later moved again to Redhill, Surrey. In 2008, Melua moved out of her parents&#x27; home in Maida Vale to an apartment in Notting Hill, where she transformed the spare bedroom into a recording studio.

After completing her GCSEs at the all-girls&#x27; grammar school Nonsuch High School in Cheam, she attended the BRIT School for the Performing Arts in the London Borough of Croydon, undertaking a BTEC with an A-level in music.

==Nationality==

On 10 August 2005, just before she turned 21, Melua became a British citizen along with her parents and brother. The citizenship ceremony took place in Weybridge, Surrey. Becoming a British citizen meant that Melua had held three citizenships before she was 21; first Soviet, Georgian and currently, British.

After the ceremony, Melua stated her pride at her newest nationality. &quot;As a family, we have been very fortunate to find a happy lifestyle in this country and we feel we belong. We still consider ourselves to be Georgian, because that is where our roots are, and I return to Georgia every year to see my uncles and grandparents, but I am proud to now be a British citizen&quot;.

==Personal life==
Melua is fluent in English and speaks some Russian; despite still speaking her native Georgian fluently she has said that she cannot write songs in the language.

Melua has been referred to as an &#x27;adrenaline junkie&#x27; because she enjoys roller coasters and funfairs and often paraglides and hang glides. She has skydived four times and taken several flying lessons, and in 2004 she was lowered from a building in New Zealand at . When asked about Melua being an &#x27;adrenaline junkie&#x27;, Mike Batt said, &quot;she enjoys extremes, but in life her emotions are always in check&quot;. In November 2009, Melua nearly drowned while diving in a lake near Heathrow Airport.

In September 2010, Melua was ordered by her doctors to stop working for a few months after suffering a nervous breakdown, resulting in her hospitalisation for six weeks. As a result, all touring and promotional activities were postponed until the following year.

Melua opened up about the breakdown years later in an interview with &quot;The Independent&quot;, saying that it ended up being one of the best things that had ever happened to her, as she said it helped to quash a feeling of superiority she felt by being a successful musician in the music industry. &quot;It was petrifying, but it put a stop to fantasies of being able to do anything. The oddest thing about this job is the sense of superiority you get. It was a huge wake-up call. I was completely out of it for two weeks, and in hospital for six. There was a bunch of things going on, things at home and crazy work schedules, and you really believe the world revolved around you and it doesn&#x27;t.&quot;

In January 2012, Melua confirmed her engagement to World Superbike racer and musician James Toseland. The couple married on 1 September 2012 in the Nash Conservatory at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, southwest London. A 2020 interview with the national Swedish news agency TT revealed that the couple had separated. Interviewed on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Lorraine&quot; live from West London on 16 October 2020, Melua confirmed that the couple had divorced.

In August 2022, Melua announced her pregnancy with her first child and gave birth to her son, Sandro, in November. Speaking to ITV News in March 2023 ahead of her European tour, Melua said that she should not have to choose between childcare and her career and that Sandro would accompany her throughout the tour.

==Career==

===Early stage===

After an upbringing in politically unstable Georgia, Melua planned initially to become either an historian or a politician. This changed in 2000, at the age of 15, when Melua took part in a talent competition on British television channel ITV called &quot;Stars Up Their Noses&quot; (a spoof of &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;) as part of the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Mad for It&quot;. Melua won the contest by singing Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;Without You&quot;. The prize was £350 worth of MFI vouchers, with which she bought a chair for her father. Had she lost the contest, she would have been gunged.

===BRIT School and Mike Batt===

After completing her GCSEs, Melua attended the BRIT School for the Performing Arts in the London Borough of Croydon, undertaking a BTEC with an A-level in music. When studying at the school, Melua began to write songs and met her future manager and producer, Mike Batt.

While performing at BRIT School showcase, Melua caught the eye of songwriter and producer Mike Batt. Batt was originally looking for an acid-rock band, bass player and a singer capable of singing &quot;jazz and blues in an interesting way&quot;. After hearing Melua sing &quot;Faraway Voice&quot; (a song she wrote about the death of her idol Eva Cassidy) Batt signed the 18-year-old Melua to his small Dramatico recording and management company and took her into the studio, producing her first three albums during the subsequent years, plus her fifth and sixth albums.

===William Orbit===

For her fourth album, &quot;The House&quot; (2010), Melua worked with producer William Orbit. She said about the experience: &quot;The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I had to do was let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn&#x27;t trying to get away from anything. It was more about going towards something. I wanted the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that&#x27;s never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that&#x27;s so ancient and old that it&#x27;s kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place&quot;. Melua would collaborate again with Orbit over a decade later on Orbit&#x27;s 2022 album, &quot;The Painter&quot;, on the opening track &quot;Duende&quot;.

==Recordings==

===&quot;Call off the Search&quot; (2003)===

Melua&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Call Off the Search&quot;, was released on 3 November 2003 and featured two songs written by Melua: &quot;Belfast (Penguins and Cats)&quot;, a song about Melua&#x27;s experience of her time in the troubled capital of Northern Ireland, and &quot;Faraway Voice&quot;, a song about the death of Eva Cassidy. Melua also covered songs by Delores J. Silver (&quot;Learnin&#x27; the Blues&quot;), John Mayall (&quot;Crawling up a Hill&quot;), Randy Newman (&quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot;) and James Shelton (&quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, originally a UK hit for singer Elkie Brooks). The other six songs on the album were by Mike Batt.

It was initially difficult for Melua and Batt to obtain airplay for the album&#x27;s lead single, the Mike Batt song &quot;The Closest Thing to Crazy&quot;. This changed when BBC Radio 2 producer Paul Walters heard the single and played it on the popular Sir Terry Wogan breakfast show. Wogan played &quot;The Closest Thing to Crazy&quot; frequently in the summer of 2003. Wogan&#x27;s support raised Melua&#x27;s profile and when &quot;Call Off the Search&quot; was released in November 2003 supported by a TV campaign financed by Batt, it entered the top 40 UK albums chart. The single achieved the number 10 spot in the UK chart. After an appearance on the Royal Variety Show the album was further boosted and Batt continued a relentless marketing campaign which saw the album hit the number one spot in January 2004. &quot;Call Off the Search&quot; reached the top five in Ireland, top 20 in Norway and top 30 in a composite European chart. In the UK the album sold 1.9 million copies, making it six times platinum, and spent six weeks at the top of the UK charts. Subsequent singles from the album did not repeat the success of the first – the second single and album title track &quot;Call Off the Search&quot; reached number 19, and the third single &quot;Crawling up a Hill&quot; got to number 41.

Melua released a 20th Anniversary Edition of the album on 3 November 2023.

===&quot;Piece by Piece&quot; (2005)===

Melua&#x27;s second album, &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, was released on 26 September 2005. Its lead single was the Mike Batt song, &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot;, which was released a week before the album on 19 September and was number three in the UK singles chart. The album contains four more songs written by Melua herself, four more by Batt (including &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot;), one Batt/Melua collaboration and three more songs described as new versions of &quot;great songs&quot;. The band line-up was the same as on the first album. The album debuted at the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart in the week of 3 October 2005. This album broke Melua across Europe where it sold 1 million copies in Germany alone and achieved the number one position in Billboard&#x27;s &quot;European&quot; albums chart. 

On 30 September 2005, Melua came under criticism in &quot;The Guardian&quot; from writer and scientist Simon Singh for the lyrics (written by Mike Batt) of the track &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot;. Batt&#x27;s disputed lyrics were:

They were interpreted by Singh as an assault on the accuracy of the work of cosmologists which sparked a series of letters from other &quot;Guardian&quot; readers, agreeing or disagreeing. On 15 October, Melua and Singh appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, and Melua light-heartedly performed the song during the interview, including Singh&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek amendments to the lyrics:

Both sides amicably agreed that the new lyrics were less likely to achieve commercial success, amidst a discussion about scientific accuracy versus artistic licence. Melua said that she &quot;should have known better&quot; because she used to be a member of the astronomy club at school.

A double A-side of the Melua-penned &quot;I Cried for You&quot; and a cover of The Cure&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; (1988), which also appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;, was released in the UK on 5 December and peaked at number 35. &quot;I Cried for You&quot; was inspired by a meeting with the writer of &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot;.

A third single, &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; was released on 17 April 2006 and peaked at number 52 in the UK. Melua embarked on a concert tour in support of &quot;Piece by Piece&quot;, the UK leg of which started in Aberdeen, Scotland on 20 January 2006. Towards the end of 2006, Melua released the single, &quot;It&#x27;s Only Pain&quot;, which was written by Mike Batt. This was followed by the release of &quot;Shy Boy&quot;, also written by Batt.

===&quot;Pictures&quot; (2007)===

Melua&#x27;s third album, &quot;Pictures&quot;, was released in the UK on 1 October 2007 and was announced to be, at least temporarily, the last of her albums in collaboration with Mike Batt as lead writer and producer. It also features Melua&#x27;s friend Molly McQueen, the former frontwoman of The Faders, as co-writer of &quot;Perfect Circle&quot;. Melua also collaborated with Andrea McEwan on the album, who wrote the lyrics for &quot;What I Miss About You&quot; and &quot;Dirty Dice&quot;. The album also featured a cover of &quot;In My Secret Life&quot; by Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Melua said of the cover, &quot;[It] completely got to me, about how we all have great ideals but in reality we end up conforming, following everyone else.&quot;

Melua released four singles from the album: &quot;If You Were a Sailboat&quot;, &quot;Mary Pickford&quot;, &quot;If the Lights Go Out&quot;, and &quot;Ghost Town&quot;. &quot;Mary Pickford&quot;, written by Mike Batt, was about the silent film star of the same name and the formation of United Artists along with Charlie Chaplin, D W Griffith and Douglas Fairbanks . &quot;Ghost Town&quot; was Melua&#x27;s first reggae-sounding song.

The iTunes version of the album includes a cover of the Prince song &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot; as a bonus track.

===&quot;The House&quot; (2010)===

Melua&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;The House&quot;, was released on 24 May 2010. Songwriters include Lauren Christy, Guy Chambers and Rick Nowels, with William Orbit producing.
Three singles anticipated the release: the first one was &quot;&quot;The Flood&quot;, released on 17 May 2010. The second one, &quot;A Happy Place&quot;, was released in July of the same year: the third and last single &quot;To Kill You With A Kiss&quot;&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;d Love To Kill You&quot; on the album) was released at the end of November.

===&quot;Secret Symphony&quot; (2012)===

Melua&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Secret Symphony&quot; was released on 5 March 2012 and also debuted high in the UK album chart. The album was produced, arranged and conducted by Mike Batt. Melua said in a statement: &quot;This album was going to be my &#x27;singer&#x27;s album&#x27;. I had always wanted to do this one day; singing other people&#x27;s songs brings something out of you and your voice that isn&#x27;t perhaps where you would have gone vocally with your own material.&quot;

===&quot;Ketevan&quot; (2013)===


Melua&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Ketevan&quot;, was released on 16 September 2013. It was co-produced by Mike Batt and his son, singer-songwriter Luke Batt, both of whom contributed songs, separately and in collaboration with Melua. Melua debuted a full orchestral version of the first single, &quot;I Will Be There&quot;, during the Coronation anniversary gala for Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in July 2013. Described as a &quot;tender and heart-warming ballad which is underpinned by Melua’s beautifully compassionate vibrato and an orchestral arrangement that builds majestically&quot;, the song was composed by Mike Batt.

&quot;Ketevan&quot; entered the UK charts at number 6, and with this accomplishment, Melua joined a very small group of female artists, which includes Madonna and Kate Bush, who have scored six consecutive UK top 10 studio albums. &quot;Ketevan&quot; also entered the top 10 in France, Poland, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland in its first week of release.

=== &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (2014) ===
Melua recorded a cover of Black&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; in 2014 for the BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Sounds of the 80s&quot; compilation album. The song was produced by Luke Batt, whom she also worked with for the &quot;Ketevan&quot; album the year before.

On 25 August 2015, the cover was released as a charity single on BMG, in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital and Sheffield Children&#x27;s Hospital. The release coincided with an advertisement campaign for Premier Inn featuring Melua&#x27;s cover, which launched on ITV on 30 August. The song reached number 73 on the UK singles chart.

===&quot;In Winter&quot; (2016)===

Melua&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;In Winter&quot;, was released on 14 October 2016. For this record, Melua went back to her native Georgia to record an album with the Gori Women&#x27;s Choir, a native Georgian all-woman singing troupe. Melua revealed during an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; that her partnership with Mike Batt had come to an end after her last album, as it was a six-album deal with Batt&#x27;s Dramatico records.

In 2017, she released a cover version of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, the official song for Children in Need.

===&quot;Album No. 8&quot; (2020) &amp; &quot;Aerial Objects&quot; (2022)===
In June 2020, Melua supported the Georgian Red Cross Society in their efforts to assist the vulnerable population in Georgia during the COVID-19 pandemic by performing a live charity concert featuring songs that were requested by her followers on her social media accounts. Melua released her eighth studio album, &quot;Album No. 8&quot;, on 16 October 2020. The lead single off the album, &quot;A Love like That&quot;, which was produced by Leo Abrahams, received its first airplay on 30 June 2020 on BBC Radio 2. The video for the song features British actor Billy Howle and was directed by Charlie Lightening, who has directed videos for the likes of Paul McCartney, Jamiroquai and Liam Gallagher. The second single, &quot;Airtime&quot; premiered on 24 July 2020. The video for &#x27;Airtime&#x27;, which again featured actor Billy Howle and was also directed by Charlie Lightning, was shot around Herne Bay over two days and was filmed according to COVID-19 lockdown guidelines.

In the summer of 2022, Melua revealed a new collaborative album with Grammy award-winning sound engineer Simon Goff, &quot;Aerial Objects&quot;. The album was released via BMG on CD and digital formats on 15 July 2022. Goff said of the album: &quot;The process of making this album has been one of discovery and giving space to each other. The sensitivity needed for this kind of process has allowed many things to surface, from us discovering the differences in how we listen to and hear music and lyrics, to our own deeply personal life experiences. The record for me is a representation of us exploring the space that exists between us and discovering a common voice from within it.&quot; Melua also embarked on a 10 date concert tour in 2022, during which she announced her first pregnancy via Instagram.

===&quot;Love &amp; Money&quot; (2023)===
In January 2023, Melua announced that her new album &quot;Love &amp; Money&quot; would be released via BMG on 24 March 2023. Leo Abrahams, who worked with Melua on her 2020 record, &quot;Album No. 8&quot;, returned to produce the record. &quot;Love &amp; Money&quot; was recorded at Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World Studios in the summer of 2022 when Melua was pregnant with her first child.

Melua embarked on a 27 date spring tour throughout Europe and the UK, titled the &quot;Love &amp; Money Tour,&quot; including a headline performance at the Royal Albert Hall. The first single and video from the record &quot;Golden Record&quot; debuted on 12 January 2023. Melua has said of the song: &quot;Writing Golden Record, it was like I was finally making peace with it all, accepting how things have changed in the industry, being happy with my lot at home and ready to face the fear of letting go of the forever funfair of the music industry.&quot; Other singles released from the album included &quot;Those Sweet Days&quot; and &quot;Quiet Moves&quot;.

In September 2023, Melua released a re-recorded version of the album track &quot;14 Windows&quot;, which served as a charity single for the Royal Medical Benevolent Fund. The track is dedicated to the memory of her psychiatrist, who treated her during her 2010 mental breakdown and committed suicide in 2022. Melua said, &quot;This song is a dedication to a doctor who saved my life. He gave me back a quality of life which I&#x27;ll be forever grateful for by helping me through a severe mental health crisis. I was off all my medication after two years of being under his care. And when I heard last year that he took his own life I was floored.&quot;

Melua recorded the English-language track, &quot;End of Summer&quot;, for the soundtrack to the Polish film The Peasants with Polish rapper and producer L.U.C and international collective Rebel Babel Film Orchestra. The track features additional production from Geoff Foster and debuted on 25 January 2024 on various streaming services. In January 2024, it was announced that Melua will make an appearance at the 35th anniversary of Byron Bay Bluesfest in Byron Bay, Australia. Melua subsequently announced additional tour dates in Sydney and Melbourne. These musical performances marked Melua&#x27;s first Australian shows in 19 years.

==Other work==

===Acting and modelling===

Melua appeared in a segment of the 2007 film &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, written by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The segment in which Melua appeared, entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, was a faux trailer, directed by Edgar Wright and produced in the style of a 1970s&#x27; Hammer House of Horror film trailer.

In 2009, Melua was named as the new face of the leading French cashmere designer, Éric Bompard.

===World record holder===

On 2 October 2006, Melua entered the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for playing the deepest underwater concert 303 metres below sea level on the Norwegian Statoil&#x27;s Troll A platform in the North Sea. Melua and her band underwent extensive medical tests and survival training in Norway before flying by helicopter to the rig.

Melua later described achieving the record as &quot;the most surreal gig I have ever done&quot;. Melua&#x27;s concert is commemorated in the DVD release &quot;Concert Under the Sea&quot;, released in June 2007.

===Charity work===

In November 2004 Melua was asked to take part in Band Aid 20 in which she joined a chorus of British and Irish pop singers to create a rendition of &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; to raise money for famine relief in Africa. Then in March 2005, Melua sang &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; with Brian May at the 46664 concert in George, South Africa for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s HIV charity. Melua had been a fan of Queen since her childhood in Georgia when her uncles played the band&#x27;s music, so performing with May was a realisation of a childhood dream. Later in 2005, through her role as a goodwill ambassador to the charity Save the Children, Melua went to Sri Lanka where she observed the work the charity was doing for children in the area after the civil war and Indian Ocean tsunami. In 2006 Melua donated all the proceeds from her single &quot;Spider&#x27;s Web&quot; to the charity.

On 7 July 2007, Melua performed at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg and in December of that year, Melua released a cover of the Louis Armstrong song &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; in which she sang with a recording of the late Eva Cassidy. All profits from the single, which entered the UK singles chart at No. 1 on 16 December 2007, went to the Red Cross.

Melua has visited Oxfam charity shops for many years, using them frequently to buy her clothing. She has stated that this is related as much to her dislike of spending and glamour as it is to her support for the charity, and admits that she looks &quot;like a tramp&quot; and that her hairdresser playfully calls her look &quot;the Romanian window cleaner&quot;.

Melua is a patron of Fair Trees, the organisation that is trying to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30 m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people are injured and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).

Melua is a patron of the Manx Cancer Help charity, which offers support to cancer sufferers and is based on the Isle of Man. She attended the 2013 fundraising ball for the charity.

Melua released a re-recorded version of her &quot;Love &amp; Money&quot; album track &quot;14 Windows&quot; in support of the Royal Medical Benevolent Fund, which offers support to doctors, medical students and their families with vital services in times of hardship. All of the proceeds from the single go towards the work of the charity.

===Musical influences===

Melua has stated that the rock band Queen were a huge influence on her as a child/teenager, with one of her memories of music being her uncle playing records by Queen and Led Zeppelin. She performed with Queen at the 46664 concert in South Africa in March 2005.

Melua appeared on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Culture Show&quot; in November 2006 advocating Paul McCartney as her choice in the search for Britain&#x27;s greatest living icon.

The College of Wooster is a private liberal arts college in Wooster, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1866 by the Presbyterian Church as the University of Wooster, it has been officially non-sectarian since 1969. From its creation, the college has been a co-educational institution. It enrolls about 1,900 students and is a member of the Five Colleges of Ohio, Great Lakes Colleges Association, and Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities.

==History==
Founded as the University of Wooster in 1866 by the Presbyterian Synod of Ohio, the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women. Ephraim Quinby, a Wooster citizen, donated the first {{convert|20|acre||abbr=}}, a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town. After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university&#x27;s first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie B. Irish, in 1882. The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.

The university gradually began to define itself as a liberal arts institution. In 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the trustees, the institution was renamed The College of Wooster reflecting a dedication to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts. The college developed under the presidency of Charles F. Wishart, 1919-1944. During the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy in the 1920s, prominent Presbyterian layman and former United States Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan attacked the college for its teaching of evolution. The subject had been taught at the college for several decades and defended by president Wishart. Bryan called for the general assembly of the church to cut off funding to the college. In 1923, Wishart defeated Bryan for the position of Moderator of the General Assembly, largely on the evolution issue, and the college continued to teach evolution. Wishart was followed by Howard F. Lowry, who served from 1944 until his death in 1967. He was followed by J. Garber Drushal, who served until 1977.

On November 10, 2015, the college named Sarah Bolton as its twelfth president and first female president. Bolton left the college at the end of the 2021–2022 academic year to assume the presidency of Whitman College. Anne E. McCall was inaugurated on October 28, 2023.

===Scottish heritage===
Wooster&#x27;s school colors are black and old gold and its mascot is the &#x27;Fighting Scot&#x27;. Early Wooster teams were known as the Presbyterians or unofficially as the &#x27;Presbyterian Steamroller.&#x27; In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black MacLeod tartan (MacLeod of Lewis), which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors. Scottish culture became an important part of the school&#x27;s heritage; today, the football games feature a Scottish pipe band with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan. The college offers the &quot;Scottish Arts Scholarship&quot; for students who perform as pipers, drummers, or Scottish dancers.
==Organization and administration==
The College of Wooster Board of Trustees named Anne E. McCall to be the 13th president of the College of Wooster on December 8, 2022.

Andrews Library, the largest library in the system, houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers. Andrews Library houses the college&#x27;s Special Collections, media library and the student writing center. The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall, the oldest branch in the system, served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962. After three decades as an art museum, the building reopened as the science library in 1998.

===Art Museum===
The College of Wooster Art Museum was established in the 1930s. The current museum was established at the Ebert Art Center in 1997. The museum houses two small galleries, the Charlene Derge Sussel Art Gallery and the Burton D. Morgan Gallery, as well as storage for the college&#x27;s permanent art collection. The museum&#x27;s encyclopedic collection spans from ancient to contemporary art. Permanent collections include the John Taylor Arms Print Collection—which represents works by Edward Hopper, Winslow Homer, Isabel Bishop, Martin Lewis, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Albrecht Dürer, Käthe Kollwitz and Félix Bracquemond—the William C. Mithoefer Collection of African Art, Middle Eastern pottery and Chinese decorative art.

==Student life==

===Residential life===

The College of Wooster is a residential campus and has 16 residence halls, which house 16 to 270 students each, and 30 program houses. 97% of the student body live in the residence halls on campus. The residence halls include Andrews Hall, Armington Hall, Babcock Hall, Bissman Hall, Bornhuetter Hall, Brush Hall, Compton Hall, Douglass Hall, Gault Manor, Gault Schoolhouse, Holden Hall, Kenarden Lodge, Luce Hall, Stevenson Hall, and Wagner Hall.

===International presence===
Elias Compton, former dean of the college, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with Ewing Christian College in Allahabad, India. Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall. The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures. This international presence affected the entire campus, establishing a tradition which continues to influence the college. Today, 15% of the student body is international in origin, representing 59 countries. The college offers majors in Cultural Area Studies and International Relations, instruction in seven foreign languages and opportunities to study abroad in 60 countries. Sixty-nine percent of Wooster students are from outside of Ohio.
* Scot Center: In early 2012, the Scot Center, a {{convert|123000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} $30 million recreation facility, opened its doors. It includes four multipurpose sport courts (for intramural basketball, volleyball and tennis), a 200-meter indoor track, a new fitness center, batting cages for baseball and softball, expanded locker rooms, coaches&#x27; offices and meeting facilities. The building also boasts a {{convert|20,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} solar roof, the largest of any college facility in the United States. The Scot Center is the first phase of a master plan to create a Campus Center.
* Babcock Residence Hall: Babcock Hall houses 60% domestic and 40% international students who desire to experience this cross-cultural living environment. Babcock Hall offers cross-cultural programming that includes regular hall meetings with student speakers and cultural activities; celebrations of holidays from around the world; and discussions of international and diversity-related issues led by faculty and invited speakers.
* Luce Residence Hall: Luce Hall houses six language suites (Chinese, Classics, French, German, Spanish, and Russian) providing students with a living/learning environment focusing on developing foreign language skills. The building features submarine-inspired architectural details, like a winding floorplan and porthole windows.

===Performing arts===

Wooster is the home of the Ohio Light Opera, an enterprise founded within the college in 1979, but not part of the college curriculum. It is the only professional company in the United States entirely devoted to operetta. OLO performs the entire Gilbert &amp; Sullivan repertoire, but also regularly revives rarely performed continental works of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Over the years, the company has produced eighty different operettas.

Wooster&#x27;s performing ensembles include the Wooster Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1915 by Daniel Parmelee, then Professor of Violin at the college. The orchestra currently is the second-oldest orchestra in continuous performance in the state of Ohio. Additional ensembles include the Scot Symphonic and Marching Bands, the Wooster Chorus, and the Wooster Jazz Ensemble.

Wooster has an active on-campus pipe band. Officially called the College of Wooster Pipe Band, members perform at many official on-campus events such as commencement, sports games (football, basketball, swim meets, and sometimes lacrosse games) and many spontaneous student-run events. During the spring season, they perform and compete at a grade 3 level, having won prizes at the Scots wi&#x27; Shotts event in Cleveland hosted by the local Lochaber Pipe Band. The Pipe Band also placed first in the grade 3 contest at the 2009 Toronto Indoor Highland Games, as the only American band competing.

The college&#x27;s department of Theatre and Dance produces two dance concerts per year, a fall concert in the round, and a spring concert in a more formal proscenium setting. Additionally, the college produces at least two plays each academic year. Further plays are produced by student groups and seniors pursuing their Independent Study projects. In 2007, Wooster&#x27;s theatre production of &#x27;Nocturne&#x27; was invited to perform at the Kennedy Center&#x27;s American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Wooster&#x27;s production was one of four shows chosen from a field of approximately 400 entries.
===Greek life, honor and professional societies===
{{Main|List of College of Wooster fraternities and sororities}}
The College of Wooster has hosted numerous fraternities, sororities and honor societies since its establishment. These number more than 80 Greek named chapters, including defunct groups, with approximately 30 active today. The most visible are the college&#x27;s Greek Academic and Social chapters. However, the Greek System includes Honor Societies and Professional Fraternities, along with Greek-aligned clubs and sections which adopted those terms when the words &quot;fraternity&quot; and &quot;sorority&quot; were discouraged.

There are currently twelve active academic and social Greek groups at the College of Wooster: six sororities, five fraternities and one co-educational group. Sometimes called clubs and sections, these groups are not affiliated with national Greek organizations, and approximately 15% of the student body participates. Wooster&#x27;s twelve Greek chapters are self-governed under an Inter-Greek Council. Noted by date of founding, social chapters include:

===Student organizations===
The college has a wide variety of student-run media. &quot;The Wooster Voice&quot; is the weekly student newspaper with a newly launched website, and has been published weekly since 1883 (see list of college newspapers), while WOO 91, which was at WCWS-FM until 2019, is the college&#x27;s online radio station that streams from iHeartRadio.

The college also has a successful Ultimate Frisbee program. The Women&#x27;s team, Betty Gone Wild, won USAUltimate&#x27;s D-III College Championship Sectionals in 2014 and 2015. Also in 2014 and 2015, they came in second at USAUltimate&#x27;s D-III College Championship Regionals. They attended the National College Championship in 2014 and came in 15th place.

The college is well known for its Moot Court team as part of the American Moot Court Association, ranked second in the nation in 2017 by the ACMA. In addition to the teams regional championships, the college routinely qualifies teams to the Moot Court Nationals tournament and was the 2008 National Champion. In 2017, Wooster qualified five teams to the nationals tournament and had teams finish 12th, 16th, and 18th in oral argument, 13th and 14th in oration, and third in appellate brief writing.

==Athletics==
Wooster&#x27;s athletic history dates back to its first baseball team, in 1880, which played only one game, losing 12–2 to Kenyon College. The football program was established in 1889; over its first two seasons, the team won all seven games it played, by a total score of 306–4. Included was a 64–0 victory at Ohio State on November 1, 1890, in the Buckeyes&#x27; first-ever home football game. Shortly thereafter, intercollegiate sports were banned by the College President. After varsity athletics returned in 1901, Wooster became an early member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC). In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the Ohio Five) broke away from the OAC to form the North Coast Athletic Conference (NCAC). The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship Division III level of the NCAA, was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports. In its first season of competition, 1984–85, the NCAC sponsored 21 sports, eleven for men and ten for women. Women&#x27;s softball was added in 1998, and women&#x27;s golf in 2010, giving the NCAC its current 23 sports. Wooster fields varsity athletic teams in all 23 of these sports.

===Baseball===
The baseball team has made five appearances in the NCAA Division III World Series, including second-place finishes in 2009 and 1997. Wooster has made 23 appearances in the NCAA baseball tournament under head coach Tim Pettorini, who has led the Scots since 1982. Pettorini has guided the Scots to over 1,100 victories, placing him in the all-time top ten among D-III baseball coaches, and the winningest active coach as of 2017. The Scots have also won a conference-record seventeen NCAC championships, most recently in 2017, under Pettorini. Prior to Pettorini&#x27;s tenure, Bob Morgan led the Scots to the NCAA tournament in each of his final five seasons, giving Wooster a total of 25 appearances since the event began in 1976. During the first decade of the 21st century, the Scots had a record of 372–98, winning more games than any other team in Division III, and were second in winning percentage over that span, trailing only The College of St. Scholastica. Following his graduation in 2010, All-American second baseman Matthew Johnson signed with the Toronto Blue Jays organization, and played for four seasons in their minor-league system.

===Basketball===
Long-time head men&#x27;s basketball coach Steve Moore has won over 700 games at Wooster, and in 2017 became the second-winningest coach all-time in NCAA Division III. His teams have won 17 NCAC championships and have made 24 appearances in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Basketball Championship, including a record 14 in a row from 2003 through 2016. The team reached the national semifinals (&quot;Final Four&quot;) of the NCAA D-III Tournament in 2003, 2007, and 2011. The 2011 team set a school record for victories, with a record of 31–3, and reached the national championship game before falling to St. Thomas (Minnesota). The 2003 team was close behind at 30–3, with center Bryan Nelson named D-III Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year. Home games are contested in the 3,400-seat Timken Gym, which is often filled to capacity for big games, including the rivalry contest with Wittenberg University and post-season tournaments. Since 2000, the Scots have been in the top ten in D-III basketball attendance every year, ranking second in some seasons, with over 2,000 fans per home game.

===Football===
Charles Follis, the first black professional football player, attended the University of Wooster and starred on the baseball team before signing with the Shelby Athletic Club to play professional football in 1902. Wooster was the last State of Ohio team not to be beaten by Ohio State, when it tied the Buckeyes at home on November 1, 1924. (as of 2018)
The football team&#x27;s greatest success occurred between 1916 and 1934; during this era, Wooster had a record of 118–31–12, and won four outright OAC championships. The 1934 title would be the Scots&#x27; last outright conference championship for 70 years, with only a trio of shared conference titles (1959/1970 OAC and 1997 NCAC) during that time.

Jack Lengyel, who is known for becoming Marshall&#x27;s head coach following the airplane crash that killed their head coach, coached Wooster for five seasons before accepting the Marshall job. In 2004, the team recorded a perfect 10–0 regular season and won its first outright NCAC conference championship, as well as its first NCAA D-III football tournament game. The 2004 team was led by senior All-American running back Tony Sutton, who set multiple NCAA Division III career rushing records and was a 2004 finalist for the Gagliardi Trophy, the D-III equivalent of the Heisman Trophy. From 1995 through 2008, Wooster&#x27;s record was 99–43, making this the most successful era since World War II. In 2009, lights and artificial turf were added to the Scots&#x27; 4,500-seat John Papp stadium. The first-ever nighttime football game at Wooster was played on October 10, 2009, against Case Western Reserve University, with Case retaining the Baird Brothers Trophy by virtue of a 53–32 victory over the Scots.

===Other sports===

In the early 2000s, the women&#x27;s field hockey and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams each won multiple NCAC championships, earning automatic bids to their national NCAA D-III tournaments. The only national championship won by a Wooster athletic team came in 1975, when the men&#x27;s golf team won the NCAA D-III title. They also have two world class, competitive ultimate frisbee teams: the Tippers and the Hawks.

===Academic All-Americans===
Since 2000, Scots have been named Academic All-Americans 32 times by College Sports Information Directors of America, in the college division, which includes NCAA Division II and Division III institutions, as well as NAIA schools, a total of over 1,000 colleges.

===Scot Center===

The Scot Center is the recreation center for students and alumni at the college. Construction was completed in January 2012 at a cost of roughly 30 million dollars. Home to the Fighting Scots, the center offers a wide assortment of fitness equipment available to both college athletes and the community. It was built to improve athletics and overall fitness at the college. The previous recreation facility for the college, Armington Physical Education Center (the PEC), was adequate. However, an increased demand for high-end facilities pressured the administration and the board of trustees to build the Scot Center. The 123,000 square-foot facility houses four intramural courts for basketball, tennis and volleyball that are put to use daily.

<doc id="663534" wikidata="Q919024" url="?curid=663534" title="British Columbia Highway 91">
<text>Highway 91 is an alternative freeway route to Highway 99 through Delta, New Westminster and Richmond, British Columbia. The highway was built in two sections, the first section from Delta to East Richmond in 1986, and the second section across Richmond in 1989.

It was the highest numbered highway in British Columbia that is not derived from a continuation of a US highway, until the designation of Highway 118 in 2003.

==Route description==

The total distance covered by Highway 91 is 22 km (14 mi). Starting at its junction with Highway 99 in East Delta, the route travels north for 2 km (1¼ mi) to a junction with Highway 10, then north for 10 km (6 mi) through three interchanges, over the Alex Fraser Bridge onto Annacis Island, and through another interchange. Highway 91 then crosses the Annacis Channel bridge, ever so briefly passing through the very corner of New Westminster, and then enters Richmond, at which point it veers west. At the southern entrance to Highway 91, the road was formerly signed as &quot;Annacis Highway&quot;, however, that name is not commonly used.

In Richmond, where Highway 91 is officially termed the &quot;Richmond Freeway&quot; but also as the &quot;East-West Connector&quot;, the route travels west for 10 more km (6 mi), through a junction with Highway 91A and two more interchanges, until it terminates just past its Richmond junction with Highway 99 at Shell Road.

==History==

===Recent improvements===

$10 million had been allocated to convert the existing seagull intersection at 72nd Avenue to an interchange; this junction was in 2009 the only at-grade intersection on Highway 91. Upgrading this interchange would earn Highway 91 the status of a full freeway, but it was reported in the &quot;Surrey Leader&quot; in 2008 that work on this proposal had ground to a halt because of disagreements between the municipal and provincial governments over the type of interchange that would be in place. The allocated funding had since been diverted for other uses, and as of 2011 the province had no intention of building the interchange, but in April 2013, International Trade Minister Ed Fast announced that the removal of the traffic signal at 72nd Avenue would be given the go-ahead. On June 8, 2016, the BC government announced that the construction of a new interchange at 72nd Avenue, priced at $30 million, would commence in the fall, thereby removing the final traffic signals on Highway 91. Construction commenced in late 2016. On August 12, 2018, the new interchange opened to remove the final traffic light on Highway 91.

In early 2009, another interchange was agreed upon to be added to Highway 91 just south of the &#x27;S&#x27; curve in Richmond, connecting Nelson Road to the highway. The interchange was opened on August 22, 2011.

On January 19, 2017, announcement was made that a new seventh travel lane will be added on Alex Fraser Bridge by slightly narrowing the existing lanes and removing the shoulders. A counterflow system with a movable barrier was added to help ease traffic during morning and afternoon rush hours. The new seventh lane opened to traffic on September 14, 2019, with the moveable reversible zipper in operation on December 16, 2019. As a result of narrower travel lanes, the maximum speed limit over the bridge was lowered from to .

==Highway 91 Connector==
Highway 91 Connector (Highway 91C) is a short unsigned highway connecting Highway 91 at Nordel Way and Highway 17 in Delta. It formerly started at the BNSF Railway level crossing on 96 Street. Today, the route starts at a trumpet interchange with Highway 17, crosses over Highway 91 via twin overpasses, and ends at the BNSF overpass on Nordel Way.

From its opening, the route faced heavy congestion due to the presence of a truck scale and at-grade intersections. The Highway 17 and Highway 91C intersection saw several truck rollover accidents since its opening in 2013 and engineer&#x27;s report revealed that trucks are susceptible to rollover when exceeding while turning from Highway 17 to Highway 91C. The report recommended installation of truck rollover warning sign and an advisory speed limit of with the ultimate long-term solution to be an upgrade to grade-separated interchange.

In 2017, the Province announced Highway 91C will be upgraded to a freeway standard as a part of $254 million project. However, the project was partially downscaled and two at-grade intersections remain in the Highway 91/91C interchange. Traffic from southbound Highway 91 and westbound Nordel Way flows freely, while signals remain for traffic movements on the new southern overpass.

The grade separation work on Highway 91C started in 2020 and free-flow interchanges were constructed at Highway 17 and Nordel Way (west) with improved partially at-grade connections for Highway 91 ramps. The project reached substantial completion by the end of November 2022 with remaining works extended up until May 31, 2023.

<text>Prem Pal Singh Rawat (born 10 December 1957), formerly known as Maharaji, is an Indian international speaker and author. His teachings include a meditation practice he calls &quot;Knowledge&quot;, and peace education based on the discovery of personal resources such as inner strength, choice, appreciation and hope.

Prem Rawat is the youngest son of Hans Ram Singh Rawat, an Indian guru and the founder of the Divya Sandesh Parishad, later known as Divine Light Mission (DLM). After his father&#x27;s death, eight-year-old Prem Rawat assumed his role. At 13, he traveled to the West and took up residence in the United States. When young adults took interest in his message, the movement grew by tens of thousands. Many in the news media were perplexed by his youth and claims of divine status; he was also criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses, and for leading an opulent lifestyle.

Prem Rawat&#x27;s marriage at the age of 16 to a non-Indian severed his relationship with his mother. At that point, the Indian branch of DLM controlled by his mother split from DLM everywhere else; at that point it was established in 55 countries. In the early 1980s, he began to discard references to religion in his speeches and closed the ashrams. The name of the DLM was changed to Elan Vital. Since that time, Prem Rawat has continued to travel extensively, speaking about peace to large and select audiences worldwide. On several occasions he has received recognition for his work and message of peace.

In 2001 he established The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF) to support his work and humanitarian efforts. Its Peace Education Program is licensed and utilized by correctional facilities and other service organizations around the world.

==History==

===1957-1970===
Prem Pāl Singh Rawat was born in Haridwar, Uttarakhand in northern India, on 10 December 1957, the fourth and youngest son of guru Hans Rām Singh Rawat and his second wife, Jagat Janani Mata Shri Rajeshwari Devi. Prem Rawat attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Academy elementary school in his hometown of Dehra Dun. At the age of four, he began speaking at his father&#x27;s meetings, and at six his father taught him the &quot;techniques of Knowledge.&quot; His father died in 1966, and during the customary 13 days of mourning, his mother and senior officials of the organization discussed the succession. Both his mother, Mata Ji, and eldest brother, Satpal Singh Rawat (known then as Bal Bhagwan Ji, and currently as Satpal Maharaj), were suggested as successors. Before either could be nominated, however, Prem Rawat addressed the crowd of mourners, reminding them that their master was immortal and still among them. In response, his mother, brother and senior disciples accepted Prem Rawat as their Satguru, bowed to his feet and received his blessing. Previously known to his father&#x27;s followers as Sant Ji, Prem Rawat now assumed the title &quot;Guru Maharaj Ji&quot; and was called &quot;Balyogeshwar&quot; by others (roughly &quot;born saint&quot; or &quot;born lord of Yogis&quot;) on account of his youth and spiritual precocity. From that time, Prem Rawat spent his weekends and school holidays traveling as his father had, addressing audiences on the subject of Knowledge and inner peace. Because of his youth, effective control of the DLM was shared by the whole family.

During the 1960s, Westerners in India searching for spiritual guidance met DLM members, and some became initiates or premies (from the Hindi &quot;prem&quot;, meaning &quot;love&quot;.) British initiates invited him to visit the West, and in 1969 he sent a Mahatma, a close Indian student, to London on his behalf. In 1970, many of his new Western followers flew to India to see him. They were present at India Gate, Delhi, when, still only twelve years old, he delivered an address known as the &quot;Peace Bomb,&quot; which marked the start of his international work.

===1971–1975===
In 1971, Prem Rawat traveled to the West against his mother&#x27;s wishes. His first western address was given in June 1971 at Glastonbury Fayre. Author Ron Geaves theorises that &quot;the convergence of Prem Rawat, formerly known as Guru Maharaj Ji, and Glastonbury Fayre in 1971 was a key event in understanding the jigsaw that came to be known as &#x27;New Age&#x27; spirituality.&quot;

He then went to Los Angeles, New York, Washington, Canada and South Africa. His arrival in the United States was met with some ridicule, as the teen-aged Rawat was seen as too immature to be a religious leader. However, he generated great interest among young adults, who were willing to examine his claimed ability to give a direct experience of God. Many were attracted by the sense of joy, peace and commitment shown by Prem Rawat&#x27;s followers. One witness said that Prem Rawat &quot;played the whole time he was there ... he played with squirt guns, flashed pictures of himself for all to see, and took movies of everybody ... Love flowed back and forth between him and his devotees.&quot; Enthusiastic new members spread the message that the 13-year-old Prem Rawat could reveal God. He returned to India later that year with 300 westerners, stayed in the mission&#x27;s ashrams.

Prem Rawat started flying lessons when he was 13, and jet training at age 15. In 1972 two Cessna airplanes were obtained for his use. Traveling almost constantly, he was reported to have residences in the United Kingdom, the United States, India, and Australia.

The 1972 &quot;Hans Jayanti&quot;, an annual festival celebrating the birthday of Rawat&#x27;s guru, was attended by over 500,000 people. Six Jumbo jets were chartered by American followers who paid extra so that South Americans could fly from New York to India for free. Other countries made similar arrangements to help the less financially able.

A reporter who attended an event in Boston in August 1973, which drew 9,000 attendees, wrote that Prem Rawat appeared humble and human, and seemed to intentionally undercut the claims of divinity made by followers. Sociologist James Downton said that from his beginnings, Prem Rawat appealed to his followers to give up concepts and beliefs that might impede them from fully experiencing the Knowledge (or life force). This, however, did not prevent them from adopting a fairly rigid set of ideas about his divinity, and projecting millennial preconceptions onto him and the movement.

Followers stressed &quot;love, peace and happiness&quot; in their lives, but public attitudes were often unsympathetic. Sociologist Stephen A. Kent wrote that as a 22-year-old hippie, he found Prem Rawat&#x27;s message to be banal and poorly delivered, though his companions spoke about it glowingly.

In August 1973 while Prem Rawat was in Detroit to receive an award, he was slapped in the face with a shaving cream pie by Pat Halley, a radical journalist. Prem Rawat said that he did not want his attacker arrested or hurt, but Halley was attacked a few days later and injured. When local members heard of the incident, they notified Prem Rawat, who requested that DLM conduct a full investigation. Two followers were identified as the assailants and the police were immediately notified. The Detroit police declined to initiate extradition proceedings. There was speculation that the lack of action may have been connected with Halley&#x27;s radical politics.

Prem Rawat&#x27;s publicity campaign was unparalleled. One journalist reported,

Thousands of people follow him wherever he goes; posters of his round, cheerful face adorn the walls of buildings in every major Western city; newspaper reporters and TV cameras cover his every public appearance—particularly his mass rallies, which attract hundreds of thousands of followers each.
A tour of US cities was cut short in early September 1973 when Prem Rawat was hospitalized with an intestinal ulcer. His physician said that his body, weakened by the pace of continual travel, showed the stresses of a middle-aged executive.

The &quot;Hans Jayanti&quot; of 1973, named &quot;Millennium &#x27;73&quot;, was held in the Houston Astrodome. Press releases said that the event would mark the beginning of &quot;a thousand years of peace for people who want peace.&quot; The main organizers were Prem Rawat&#x27;s eldest brother Satpal Rawat and activist Rennie Davis, who predicted an attendance of 100,000 or more; the event attracted about 20,000. Although not covered by the national television news, it received extensive coverage in print media and was depicted in the award-winning US documentary &quot;Lord of the Universe&quot;. The premies were described as &quot;cheerful, friendly and unruffled... nourished by their faith&quot;. To the 400 premie parents who attended, Prem Rawat was &quot;a rehabilitator of prodigal sons and daughters&quot;. Some reporters, however, found &quot;a confused jumble of inarticulately expressed ideas.&quot; The event was called the &quot;youth culture event of the year&quot;.

The event&#x27;s failure to meet expectations hurt the Divine Light Mission and left it heavily in debt, forcing changes within the movement. By 1976, the DLM was able to reduce the debt to $80,000. According to Thomas Pilarzyk, the Millennium economic deficit was partly the result of poor management by the &quot;holy family&quot; (Prem Rawat&#x27;s mother and three older brothers), and partly the much lower than anticipated attendance.

Because of Prem Rawat&#x27;s youth, his mother, Mata Ji, and eldest brother, Satpal Rawat, managed the affairs of the worldwide DLM. When Prem Rawat reached sixteen years of age he wanted to take a more active part in guiding the movement. According to the sociologist James V. Downton, this meant he &quot;had to encroach on his mother&#x27;s territory and, given the fact that she was accustomed to having control, a fight was inevitable&quot;. In December 1973, Prem Rawat took administrative control of the Mission&#x27;s US branch; his mother and Satpal returned to India.

By the end of 1973, the DLM was active in 55 countries. Tens of thousands had been initiated, and several hundred centers and dozens of ashrams were formed. 1973 has been called the &quot;peak of the Mission&#x27;s success&quot;.

Rawat&#x27;s upscale lifestyle was a source of controversy in the early 1970s. Some media reports said that he &quot;lived more like a king than a Messiah&quot;. Critics alleged that his lifestyle was supported by the donations of followers and that the movement appeared to exist only to support his &quot;opulent existence&quot;. Supporters said there is no conflict between worldly and spiritual riches, and that Rawat did not advise anyone to &quot;abandon the material world&quot;, but said it is our attachment to it that is wrong. Press reports listed expensive automobiles such as Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Benz limousines and sports cars, some of them gifts. Rawat said, &quot;I have something far more precious to give them than money and material things—I give peace&quot;. &quot;Maharaj Ji&#x27;s luxuries are gifts from a Western culture whose fruits are watches and Cadillacs&quot;, a spokesman said. Some premies said that he did not want the gifts, but that people gave them out of their love for him. They saw Rawat&#x27;s lifestyle as an example of a &quot;lila&quot;, or divine play, which held a mirror to the &quot;money-crazed and contraption-collecting society&quot; of the West.

In May 1974, a judge gave Prem Rawat consent to marry without parental permission. His marriage to Marolyn Johnson, a 24-year-old follower from San Diego, California, was celebrated at a non-denominational church in Golden, Colorado. Prem Rawat&#x27;s mother, Mata Ji, had not been invited.

Prem Rawat&#x27;s marriage to a non-Indian finally severed his relationship with his mother. She retained control of the Indian DLM and appointed Satpal as its leader. Mata Ji said she was removing Prem Rawat as Perfect Master because of his &quot;unspiritual&quot; lifestyle and lack of respect for her wishes. Rawat retained the support of the Western disciples. Most of the mahatmas either returned to India or were dismissed. Prem Rawat had become wealthy as a result of contributions from his Western devotees, and led the life of an American millionaire. He ran a household for his wife, his brother (Raja Ji) and his sister-in-law (Claudia), and financed travel for the close officials and mahatmas who accompanied him on his frequent trips around the globe to attend the Mission&#x27;s festivals. By early 1974 the number of full-time DLM staff had increased from six to over one thousand.

In November 1974, seeking more privacy for himself, his wife and his entourage following security concerns, Prem Rawat moved to a property in Malibu, California. Purchased by the DLM for $400,000, the property served as the DLM&#x27;s West Coast headquarters. Controversy around a helipad on the property was resolved by installing emergency water storage for the Los Angeles County Fire Department and limiting the number of permitted flights.

===1976–2000===

By 1976, most students viewed Prem Rawat primarily as a spiritual teacher, guide and inspiration. In January 1976 Prem Rawat encouraged them to leave the ashrams and discard Indian customs and terminology. He said that the organization had come between his devotees and himself. He decentralized some decision making to local premie communities, while he maintained his status as the ultimate authority over spiritual and secular matters. The staff at the Denver headquarters were reduced from 250 to 80. He described the managerial mentality that had grown in the Mission as &quot;only cosmetic and totally unnecessary. It&#x27;s like trying to take a cow and put lipstick on it. You can do it, but it&#x27;s unnecessary in practical terms&quot;.

His appearance on 20 December 1976 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, wearing a traditional Krishna costume for the first time since 1975, signaled a resurgence of Indian influence and devotion. During 1977, many returned to &quot;ashram&quot; life, and there was a shift back from secular tendencies towards ritual and messianic beliefs. In 1977 Rawat became a US citizen.

In October 1978, the hillsides surrounding Rawat&#x27;s Malibu estate were burned by a brushfire. His family and the DLM headquarters subsequently moved to Miami Beach, Florida. The family, which had grown to include four children, returned to Malibu in 1984.

During the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, the movement attracted substantial adverse publicity. In January 1979 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Rawat was maintaining his Malibu following despite a rising mistrust of cults. Bob Mishler and Robert Hand, a former vice president of the movement, complained that money was increasingly diverted to Prem Rawat&#x27;s personal use, and that the ideals of the group had become impossible to fulfill. The charges found little support and did not affect the progress of the Mission.

In 1980, Rawat removed all the &quot;religious&quot; aspects of the movement and declared he now wanted &quot;no movement whatsoever&quot;. The Hindu references and religious parables that had been prominent in his teachings gave way to a focus on the meditation techniques. Once called &quot;Perfect Master&quot;, Rawat abandoned his &quot;almost divine status as guru&quot; but affirmed his status as a master. Scholars such as Kranenborg and Chryssides describe the departure from divine connotations. In 1983 the Divine Light Mission was renamed Elan Vital and Rawat closed the last western &quot;ashrams&quot;, marking the end of his use of Indian methods for international objectives.

Throughout this period, Rawat toured extensively. In one two-year period he spoke at over 100 programs in 37 international cities, including New York, London, Paris, Kuala Lumpur, Rome, Delhi, Sydney, Tokyo, Caracas and Los Angeles.

In 1990 there were said to be 1.2 million followers worldwide, with 50,000 in the United States. The year 1999 saw the commencement of regular satellite broadcasts to North America and other countries.

===2001 – present===

In 2001, Prem Rawat founded The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF), a Public Charitable Organization to support his message, and worldwide humanitarian efforts.

Writing in 2006, professor Ron Geaves, a long-time supporter of Rawat, noted how Elan Vital had explained that the only effective way of reaching out to the over 80 countries where Rawat&#x27;s message was being promoted was by leased private jet, which Rawat self-piloted, flying around a quarter million miles a year.

A biography of Rawat, &quot;Peace is Possible&quot;, by Andrea Cagan, was published in 2006 with a foreword by Emilio Colombo, former President of the European Parliament and Prime Minister of Italy. In 2007, Rawat started the Peace Education Program for inmates which, as of 2012, operates in 25 prisons across 10 countries. Michael Gilbert, UTSA associate professor of criminal justice, stated that,&quot;The constructive changes in behavior among participants have been noticed in our local Dominguez prison&quot;.

In 2006, Pierre Weil, Rector of UNIPAZ in Florianopolis, Brazil - a campus of an &#x27;International Peace University&#x27; non-profit organization - awarded Prem Rawat the honorary title of Ambassador of Peace. In 2009, Prem Rawat was made Ambassador of Peace for the Basilicata region of Italy. In 2010, he spoke at the &quot;Words of Peace for Europe&quot; conference in Brussels, at the invitation of European Parliament Vice-President Gianni Pittella.

In 2011, he again spoke at the Brussels conference, &quot;Peace and Prosperity. Founding Values of the European Union.&quot; At this conference, he was named ambassador of the Brussels Declaration “Pledge to Peace,” signed at the European Parliament. The Pledge to Peace was inspired by the principles of freedom, equality and solidarity enshrined in the preamble of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The Declaration of Intent encourages signatory governments, organizations, and companies to act independently in the design and development of peace projects.
In 2012, in Malaysia, Prem Rawat was awarded the Asia Pacific Brands Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, &quot;for his contributions in championing and promoting global peace.&quot;

In 2016, Prem Rawat delivered the keynote address at a forum hosted by TPRF and the Tutu Foundation UK at the British Film Institute in London. Government officials and NGO leaders met to explore peace education, reconciliation, alternatives to violence, prison reform and breaking the cycle of crime.

In March 2021, the Italian Ministry of Justice, Department of Penitentiary Administration, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to implement the Peace Education Program for inmates&#x27; rehabilitation. In April 2021, a similar agreement was signed with the South African government to implement this Program throughout the country&#x27;s correctional centres.

On 17 June 2022, 51 years after he spoke at the Glastonbury Music Festival in June 1971, Prem Rawat received the first “Key of Avalon” award from the Council of Glastonbury, United Kingdom, in recognition of fifty years of working for peace across the world and his services to humanity.

Rawat is mentioned in the Guinness Book of World Records: &quot;The largest audience at a book reading for a single author is 114,704 and was achieved by Prem Rawat (USA), in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India, on 2 April 2023. The author read chapter 3 of his latest book “Hear Yourself” in Hindi to a ticket paying audience. The attempt was held at the Mata Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow.&quot;

Another Guinness world-record: The largest attendance at a lecture is 375,603 and was achieved by Prem Rawat (USA), in Gaya, Bihar, India, on 26 November 2023.

==Teachings==

The core of Prem Rawat&#x27;s teaching is that the individual&#x27;s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact a constant source of peace and joy. Rather than a body of dogma, he emphasizes a direct experience of transcendence that he says is accessible through the meditation techniques he teaches.

A number of scholars have said that Prem Rawat&#x27;s teachings began in the North Indian Sant Mat or Radhasoami tradition, which dismisses ritual and claims that true religion is a matter of loving and surrendering to God who dwells in the heart. Geaves argues that this is not quite correct; referring to Rawat&#x27;s own statements about his lineage, he places Rawat and his father within the tradition established by Totapuri, which also gave rise to the Advait Mat movement. Geaves argues that while the teachings within Totapuri&#x27;s lineage have similarities with those of the Radhasoami tradition and developed in the same geographical area, they are nevertheless distinct. He adds that Rawat &quot;is unusual in that he does not consider his lineage to be significant and does not perceive his authority as resting in a tradition.&quot;

Rawat has been criticized for a lack of intellectual content in his public discourses.

===Techniques of Knowledge===

Prem Rawat states that light, love, wisdom and clarity exist within each individual, and that the meditation techniques which he teaches, and which he learned from his teacher, are a way of accessing them. These techniques are known as the &#x27;Knowledge&#x27;. In his public talks he quotes from Hindu, Muslim and Christian scriptures, but he relies on this inner experience for his inspiration and guidance.

Before they receive the &quot;Knowledge&quot;, Rawat asks practitioners to promise to give it a fair chance and to stay in touch with him. He also asks that they not reveal the techniques to anyone else, but allow others to prepare to receive the experience for themselves.

Practitioners describe &quot;Knowledge&quot; as internal and highly individual, with no associated social structure, liturgy, ethical practices or articles of faith. According to sociologist Alan E. Aldridge, Prem Rawat says he offers practical ways to achieve spiritual tranquillity that can be used by anyone. Aldridge writes that Rawat originally aspired to bring about world peace, but now he places his attention on helping individuals rather than society.

George Chryssides describes what Prem Rawat terms &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; as based on self-understanding and an inner self, identical with the divine.

Mighty River Press published a biography of Prem Rawat in 15 November 2007, written by Andrea Cagan: &quot;Peace Is Possible. The Life and Message of Prem Rawat&quot; 

==Organizations==

Rawat inherited the first organization he was associated with (Divine Light Mission) from his father. Moving away from the trappings of Indian culture and religion, he later established Elan Vital and Words of Peace International, independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles, and not bound to the traditions of India. The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF) founded in 2001, added more focus to humanitarian efforts.

===Divine Light Mission===

The Divine Light Mission (&quot;Divya Sandesh Parishad&quot;; DLM) was an organization founded in 1960 by guru Hans Rawat for his following in northern India. During the 1970s, the DLM gained prominence in the West under the leadership of his fourth and youngest son, Prem Rawat. Some scholars noted the influence of the Bhagavad Gita and the Sant Mat tradition, but the western movement was widely seen as a new religious movement, a cult, a charismatic religious sect or an alternative religion. DLM officials said the movement represented a church rather than a religion.

===Elan Vital and Words of Peace International===

DLM was disbanded when Prem Rawat renounced the trappings of Indian culture and religion, making his teachings independent of culture, beliefs and lifestyles. The DLM in the United States changed its name to Elan Vital in 1983, by filing an entity name change. Elan Vital became the name shared by several organizations supporting the work of Rawat. Independent Elan Vital organizations in several countries engaged in raising funds, organising speaking engagements by Rawat and in some cases broadcast his public addresses. Currently, Elan Vital is no longer connected to its originally Hindu or Sikh religious background. Elan Vital, Inc. in the U.S. is registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. It has been labelled a &quot;church&quot; in reference to its tax status. Its 2005 articles of incorporation described its purpose as performing &quot;religious, charitable and educational activities&quot;. The Elan Vital website states that Elan Vital ceased operations in 2010, and has been succeeded by new entities such as Words of Peace International, Inc.

===The Prem Rawat Foundation and others===
In 2001, Prem Rawat founded The Prem Rawat Foundation (TPRF), a Public Charitable Organization for the production and distribution of materials promoting his message, and also for funding worldwide humanitarian efforts. TPRF has provided food, water and medical help to war-torn and impoverished areas.

The Peace Education Program (PEP), founded by TPRF, is a media-based educational program that helps participants explore the possibility of personal peace, and to discover personal resources – tools for living such as inner strength, choice, appreciation and hope. The program, not only successful in some educational institutions, had by 2012 also been adopted by 28 prisons in 10 countries including the United States, South Africa, India, Spain, Ireland, the U.K. and Australia. The voluntary program takes inmates onto a unique route of rehabilitation involving self-discovery, and hopes of a fulfilled life, within or without the prison walls.

==Reception==

===Media===
From Prem Rawat&#x27;s first travels in the West, he and his followers attracted media attention. In an interview in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1973, Prem Rawat said, &quot;I have lost confidence in newspapers. I talk with them [about this] and the next day something completely different is printed.&quot; In 1973, the Divine Light Mission&#x27;s 50-member public relations team concluded that Prem Rawat&#x27;s credibility had been compromised by his youth, his physical appearance, and the Rolls-Royce, as well as the Detroit &quot;pieing&quot; incident and an allegation of smuggling (which was never prosecuted). The head of the team said that they needed to get the public to look past these factors to judge Prem Rawat&#x27;s credibility.

Rawat commented on criticism during an interview on a Taiwan News channel in June 2014, &quot;So far I&#x27;m concerned, my focus in life is not to appease critics, but is to bring the message of peace to people. ... When you&#x27;ve been doing what I have been doing for 5 decades plus, yes you&#x27;re gonna get critics. ... People said, &quot;He&#x27;s going to fade away.&quot; Well, how about fifty-two years. And I&#x27;m still doing strong, because it is about my conviction. And my conviction is &quot;peace is possible&quot;. And I will do everything that I must do, because it&#x27;s important to me that people find that peace in their life.&quot;

Biographer Andrea Cagan described Rawat as a man who loves life and is focused &quot;on spreading the message of peace.&quot;

In 2014, independent filmmaker Cynthia Fitzpatrick produced &quot;Inside Peace&quot;, a documentary about several inmates who had participated in TPRF&#x27;s Peace Education Program while incarcerated at Dominguez State Prison, Texas. Premiering in 2015 in the United States and the United Kingdom to a positive critical response, &quot;Inside Peace&quot; received several awards. PBS aired the film across the United States in 2018.

In 2019, Penguin Random House published Prem Rawat’s book, &quot;Peace Is Possible - Thoughts on happiness, success and relationships for a deeper understanding of life&quot;. In 2020, Penguin Random House also released Prem Rawat’s book, &quot;Escúchate&quot;, the Spanish-language edition of &quot;Hear Yourself.&quot; The English version was released by Harper-Collins on 14 September 2021.

===Sociologists&#x27; views: leadership type===
Several scholars referred to Max Weber&#x27;s classification of authority when describing Rawat as a charismatic leader.

J. Gordon Melton said Prem Rawat&#x27;s personal charisma was one of the reasons for the rapid spread of his message among members of the 1960s counterculture.

Thomas Pilarzyk, a sociologist, wrote in a 1978 paper that the distribution of power and authority in the DLM was officially based on the charismatic appeal of Maharaj Ji, which he described as being somewhat ambiguous, and that many followers were not certain about his position in the organizational scheme of the movement, or the claim that he was the only true spiritual master.

By the early 1980s Meredith McGuire, a professor of sociology and anthropology, saw a process of formalization (transition of charismatic to rational management), resulting from Rawat&#x27;s desire to consolidate his power and authority over the movement in the United States.

Around the same time, Paul Schnabel, a sociologist, described Rawat as a pure example of a charismatic leader. He characterized Rawat as materialistic, pampered and intellectually unremarkable compared to Osho, but no less charismatic.

Lucy DuPertuis, a sociologist and one-time follower who assisted James V. Downton with his book about the Divine Light Mission, described Rawat&#x27;s role as a Master as emerging from three interrelated phenomena: traditional or theological definitions of &quot;Satguru&quot;; adherents&#x27; first-hand experiences of the Master; and communal accounts and discussions of the Master among devotees.

David G. Bromley described Prem Rawat and other founders of new religions as being held in awe by their early followers, who ascribe extraordinary powers to them that set them apart from other human beings. When describing the difficulty of charismatic leaders in proving to be above normal human failings such as not to suffer ill health or indulge in worldly pursuits, he used Rawat&#x27;s marriage as an example.

Stephen J. Hunt described Prem Rawat&#x27;s major focus as being on stillness, peace and contentment within the individual, with his &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; consisting of the techniques to obtain these. According to Hunt, in Rawat&#x27;s case the notion of spiritual growth is not derived – as is traditionally the case with other gurus – from his personal charisma, but from the nature of his teachings and the benefits to the individuals applying them.

Ron Geaves, a professor in various fields of religion and long-time adherent of Rawat, wrote that Rawat is not a renunciate, and that he has made great efforts to assert his humanity and take apart the hagiography that has developed around him. According to Geaves Rawat, rather than considering himself a charismatic leader, deemphasizes the sealing of the master disciple relationship, and focuses on correct practice and staying in touch through participation or listening.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIP/Cagan&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Following===
Estimates of the number of Prem Rawat&#x27;s adherents have varied widely over time. Petersen stated that Rawat claimed 7 million disciples worldwide in 1973, with 60,000 in the US. Rudin &amp; Rudin gave a worldwide following of 6 million in 1974, of which 50,000 were in the US. According to these authors, the adherents had fallen to 1.2 million for Prem Rawat&#x27;s personal worldwide following in 1980, with 15,000 in the US. Spencer J. Palmer and Roger R. Keller published a general DLM membership of 1.2 million worldwide, with 50,000 in the US, in 1990 and 1997.

James V. Downton, who studied Prem Rawat&#x27;s followers for five years in the 70s, said &quot;these young people had a spiritual experience which deeply affected them and changed the course of their lives. It was an experience which moved many to tears of joy, for they had found the answer they had been seeking&quot;. Downton said by 1976 the vast majority of students viewed Rawat &quot;as their spiritual teacher, guide and inspiration&quot;. Quoting a student he had studied, Downton said a typical view was that &quot;the only thing he (Rawat) wants is to see people living happily and harmoniously together&quot;. Downton concluded that the students had changed in a positive way, &quot;more peaceful, loving, confident and appreciative of life&quot;.

Paul Schnabel referenced professor in the psychology of religion Van der Lans saying that among his Western students, Rawat appeared to stimulate an uncritical attitude, which gave them an opportunity to project their fantasies of divinity onto his person. According to Schnabel, the divine nature of the guru is a standard element of Eastern religion, but removed from its cultural context, and confounded with the Western understanding of God as a father, what is lost is the difference between the guru&#x27;s person and that which the guru symbolizes—resulting in what was described as limitless personality worship. Stephen Hunt wrote that Western followers do not see themselves as members of a religion, but rather as adherents of a system of teachings focused on the goal of enjoying life to the full.

Former followers became known as &quot;ex-premies&quot;.

<doc id="663541" wikidata="Q3133004" url="?curid=663541" title="Henry Pellatt">
<text>Major-General Sir Henry Mill Pellatt, (January 6, 1859 – March 8, 1939) was a Canadian financier and soldier. He is notable for his role in bringing hydro-electricity to Toronto for the first time, and also for his large château in Toronto, called Casa Loma, which was the biggest private residence ever constructed in Canada. Casa Loma would eventually become a well-known landmark of the city. His summer home and farm in King City later became Marylake Augustinian Monastery.

Pellatt was also a noted supporter of the Boy Scouts of Canada. His first wife, Mary, was the first Chief Commissioner of the Girl Guides of Canada.

== Early life and family ==
Pellatt was born in Kingston, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of Henry Pellatt (1830–1909), a Glasgow-born stockbroker in Toronto, and Emma Mary Pellatt (&quot;née&quot; Holland). His great-grandfather was the glassmaker Apsley Pellatt.

Pellatt had three sisters and two brothers, Fred Pellatt (grandfather of Toronto-based freelance writer John Pellatt) and Mill Pellatt (father of Mary Katherine Pellatt). The latter brother was paymaster of the Toronto Electric Light Company, a job obtained for him by Pellatt. His sisters were Mary Kate, Marian Maria and Emily Mountford Pellatt. One of his nieces, Beatrix Hamilton, was married to Canadian economist and humourist Stephen Leacock.

He was educated at Upper Canada College before leaving in 1876 to join his father&#x27;s stock brokerage company, Pellatt and Osler, as a clerk. In 1882, Pellatt&#x27;s father and Sir Edmund Boyd Osler parted ways, and Pellatt completed his apprenticeship and became a full member of the stock exchange. In the following year, Pellatt&#x27;s father set up a partnership with his son under the name Pellatt and Pellatt.

Pellatt married twice, first to Mary Dodgson in Toronto in 1882 and, after Mary&#x27;s death in 1924, to Catharine Welland Merritt in Toronto in 1927 (which lasted until her death in 1929). With his first wife, he had one son, Reginald Pellatt (1885–1967), who was a Colonel and married with no children.

== Military service and honours ==
Pellatt enlisted as a rifleman with The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada on 2 November 1876. He rose through the ranks and eventually became the Commanding Officer. In 1905, he was created a Knight Bachelor by King Edward VII for his service with The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada.

In 1910, Pellatt took the entire 600-man regiment (including its horses) to England for military training at his expense, to mark the Regiment&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The military exercises lasted from August 13 to October 3, 1910.

Pellatt later served as the regiment&#x27;s Honorary Colonel and was promoted to the rank of Major-General upon his retirement from the regiment. In addition, he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1910.

From 1911 to 1923, he was the Knight Principal of the Imperial Society of Knights Bachelor.

== Later years ==

Much of Pellatt&#x27;s fortune was made through investments in the railway and hydro-electric industries in Canada, including the Toronto Electric Light Company. He also made significant investment in the Cobalt Lake Mining Company during the Cobalt silver rush of 1903. Later in around 1915, using riches from his Cobalt Lake Mining Company, he invested in the fledging McIntyre Mines in Timmins Ontario. However, legislator Adam Beck launched a campaign against the great industrialists of Canada, proclaiming that hydro power &quot;should be as free as air&quot;. Through legislative process and by whipping up anti-rich sentiment, Beck was able to successfully appropriate Pellatt&#x27;s life work and take his electric companies from him. Beck then led a populist revolt to raise Pellatt&#x27;s taxes on his castle, Casa Loma, from $600 per year to $12,000. The strain of losing all of his income, coupled with the large increase in property taxes for his castle, led him to rely solely on his real estate investments, which were unsuccessful due to the beginning of the First World War. After the province expropriated his electrical power generating business, and his aircraft manufacturing business was appropriated by Beck as part of the war effort during the First World War, Pellatt was driven to near-bankruptcy, which forced him and Lady Pellatt to leave Casa Loma in 1923. They therefore moved to their farm at Marylake in King City.

Prior to building Casa Loma, Pellatt sold his summer retreat in Blantyre / Fallingbrook area of southwest Scarborough to his son Reginald and other parts of the estate to others; Chateau des Quatre Vents at 3025 Queen Street East was built in 1892 by William T. Murray on land acquired from Pellatt former summer estate. E.J. Lennox built another home in front of 3025 and signed as 3027 Queen Street East in 1910. The estate was once on land owned by Peter Patterson and before that Clergy Reserve. Only the groundskeeper home remains and rest of the estate redeveloped into residential homes. His summer estate was destroyed in a fire in the 1920s.

Pellatt later built Bailey House in Mimico, at the bend in Lake Shore near Fleeceline, overlooking the commercial stretch on Lake Shore (the house later became a Legion Hall and was demolished to make way for a roadway). He subsequently moved in with his chauffeur, Thomas Ridgway, and it was in this house that Pellatt died.

After he died on March 8, 1939, thousands of people lined Toronto streets to witness his funeral procession, and he was buried with full military honours. He is interred at Forest Lawn Mausoleum, north of Toronto.

His life has been featured in the film &quot;The Pellatt Newsreel&quot;, which aired on the Biography Channel and was nominated for a 2009 Gemini for Best Biography Documentary. The film, narrated by Colin Mochrie, is shown continuously in the theatre at Casa Loma, which is located where the swimming pool was planned to be.

Several biographies have been written about Pellatt. In particular, Carlie Oreskovich&#x27;s &quot;The King of Casa Loma&quot; gives a detailed and thorough account. His first wife&#x27;s great-grandniece, Trelawny Linda Howell, also curates a website dedicated to his memory, CasaLomaTrust.ca.

<text>Highway 91A, or the Queensborough Connector, is a 3 km (2 mi) long spur off Highway 91. Highway 91A crosses the Queensborough Bridge and terminates at Marine Way, allowing traffic into New Westminster. Residents of New Westminster can use Highway 91A as a convenient route towards the Canada/U.S. border. Although the Queensborough Bridge has existed since 1960, the highway spur section was opened only in 1986, at the same time the first section of Highway 91 was completed. (All of Highway 91A was once known as Highway 91 until the east-west portion of Highway 91 was built in the late 1980s; the route was redesignated as an alternate after that time.)

Highway 91A, in addition to being known as an extension of the Annacis Highway, is also known as the &quot;Queensborough Connector&quot;.

The junction of Highways 91 and 91A was converted to an interchange in the late 1990s.

The interchange with Marine Way was reconstructed in the late 2000s as part of a $211-million-dollar project to improve access to Lower Mainland border crossings. Median barriers were also installed on Highway 91A over the Queensborough Bridge, and the Howes Street intersection was upgraded to a full interchange.

<text>Regent University is a private Christian university in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States. It was founded by Pat Robertson in 1977 as Christian Broadcasting Network University and changed its name to Regent University in 1990. Regent offers on-campus programs as well as distance education. Regent offers associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in over 70 courses of study. The university is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

==History==

Plans for the university, originally named Christian Broadcasting Network University, were begun in 1977 by Pat Robertson; Robertson remained Chancellor until his death in 2023. In 1990, the name was changed to Regent University. The university&#x27;s name is designed to reference a regent, a person who exercises power in a monarchical country during the absence or incapacity of the sovereign; according to the school&#x27;s catalog, &quot;a regent is one who represents Christ, our Sovereign, in whatever sphere of life he or she may be called to serve Him.&quot; The university&#x27;s current motto is &quot;Christian Leadership to Change the World.&quot;

The first class, consisting of seventy-seven students, began in fall of 1978 when the school leased classroom space in Chesapeake, Virginia. In 1980, the first graduating class held its commencement; the school of education opened that Fall. That year, the university took residence for the first time on its current campus in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The school proceeded to open its schools of business, divinity, government, and law by the mid-1980s. In 1984, Regent University received accreditation from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1997, online classes began.

In 1995, the university opened a secondary campus in Alexandria, Virginia but sold it soon after. In 2000, Regent began an undergraduate degree-completion curriculum under the auspices of a new program, the Center for Professional Studies. This would later become the school of undergraduate studies, before finally being renamed as the college of arts and sciences in 2012.

==Campus==

===Architecture and setting===
The campus of Regent University comprises of historicist neo-Georgian architecture, and is situated in the coastal city of Virginia Beach, Virginia. The university was named in 2015 among the thirty most beautiful college campuses in the South.

===Academic and communal facilities===
The University Library Building houses the university&#x27;s libraries while Robertson Hall is home to the Schools of Government, Law, and Undergraduate Studies. The Communication &amp; Performing Arts Center, home for the School of Communication &amp; the Arts, is a building with two theatres, a production studio, sound stage, screening theatres, and a backlot. The Student Center is a facility includes a bookstore, student organization offices, dining hall, computer lab, and student lounge. The Administration Building, along with administrative offices, includes the School of Education. The Classroom Building accommodates the schools of Business &amp; Leadership and Psychology &amp; Counseling. The adjoined Chapel and Divinity Building are the most recent additions to the campus, completed in 2013.

===The Founders Inn and Spa===
Completed in 1990, The Founders Inn and Spa hotel was originally part of the Christian Broadcasting Network before Regent University assumed ownership. It was sold to the Hilton Hotel company in 2018. The hotel features neo-Georgian architecture in keeping with the rest of the university campus. The name of the hotel refers to the Founding Fathers.

==Reputation==

===Online programs rankings===
Regent University was ranked in 2015 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the 11th best online undergraduate program in the nation, and as the second best by OEDb in 2009. Regent is ranked 21st, 46th, and 78th, respectively, for its online graduate education programs, online graduate business programs, and online MBA. Regent&#x27;s online MBA faculty was ranked first nationally in 2013 by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

===ABA national competition wins and moot court program===
Moot court teams from the Regent University School of Law have placed as quarter-finalists or better in over 100 moot court competitions, winning more than 40 national and regional events. In 2006 and 2007, Regent Law won several national ABA moot court and negotiation competitions succeeding against teams from Harvard and Yale. Regent&#x27;s moot court program was ranked sixth in the nation in 2015.

===Ideology===

In 1995, theologian Harvey Cox wrote that Regent has been called &quot;the Harvard of the Christian Right&quot; but noted that &quot;Regent, it appears, is not so much a boot camp for rightist cadres as a microcosm of the theological and intellectual turbulence within what is often mistakenly seen as a monolithic &#x27;religious right&#x27; in America&quot;.

With the goal of expanding its mission beyond a solely conservative base and to &quot;posture itself as a broadly evangelical institution&quot;, the Regent School of Divinity convened a scholarly colloquium with the more liberal National Council of Churches and the Virginia Council of Churches, associations of mainline Protestant churches in 2008. The conference discussed their common approaches to evangelizing.

=== Freedom of expression controversy ===
In September 2007, Adam Key, a second-year law student at Regent, posted a lifted still from a video to the social networking website Facebook showing the school&#x27;s chancellor, Pat Robertson, scratching his forehead with his middle finger. The still gave the appearance that Robertson was making an obscene gesture. Key also criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. School officials asked Key to remove the still, publicly apologize and withhold public comment, or alternatively, defend the posting. Key removed the photograph, but refused to apologize. He was subsequently suspended and removed. In November 2007, Key filed a lawsuit against Regent. Robertson said that freedom of speech does not encompass the use of these kinds of images. The university stated that Key violated the school&#x27;s standards of conduct. However, Key&#x27;s attorney countered with examples of racist images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action.

The school later claimed its actions were unrelated to the photograph and that Key was a &quot;security risk&quot;; his attorney countered with an internal memo sent the day before the suspension indicating that Robertson was concerned with Key&#x27;s &quot;complaints&quot;. In June 2009, the lawsuit was dismissed.

===Bush administration hires===
According to Regent University, more than 150 of its graduates were hired by the federal government during the George W. Bush presidency including dozens in Bush&#x27;s administration. As it was previously rare for alumni to go into government, &quot;Boston Globe&quot; journalist Charlie Savage suggested that the appointment of Office of Personnel Management director Kay Coles James, the former dean of Regent&#x27;s government school, caused this sharp increase in Regent alumni employed in the government. An article about a Regent graduate who interviewed for a government position and Regent&#x27;s low school rankings were cited as an example of the Bush administration hiring applicants with strong conservative credentials but weaker academic qualifications and less civil rights law experience than past candidates in the Civil Rights Division. In addition to Savage, several other commentators made similar assertions.

However, Savage noted that the school had improved since its days of &quot;dismal numbers&quot; and that the school has had wins in national moot-court and negotiation competitions. Though a prominent critic of the school, Barry Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State advised against &quot;underestimat[ing] the quality of a lot of the people that are there.&quot;

===Relationship with President Donald Trump===
In October 2016, Regent University was the site of an October 2016 rally for presidential candidate Donald J. Trump. A handful of Regent alumni said that Trump&#x27;s values, however, were &quot;wrong for the university.&quot; Regent University alumnus Jay Sekulow was a defense lawyer for President Trump.

==Faculty==

Regent has 138 full-time and 48 part-time faculty members, five of whom are Fulbright Scholars. Several were previously in politics. Former U.S. Attorney General under the Bush administration, John Ashcroft, was named distinguished professor in 2005 teaching a two-week course each semester in the Robertson School of Government and lecturing on national security law. Also named distinguished professor was former chief of naval operations Admiral Vern Clark who teaches courses in leadership and government. In 2006, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak was a visiting faculty member for the school of undergraduate studies. Herb Titus, founding dean of the law school, was the 1996 vice-presidential candidate of the Constitution Party and a drafter of the Constitutional Restoration Act to permit government officials to acknowledge &quot;God as the sovereign source of law, liberty, or government&quot;. He was fired in 1993 for holding a view of Dominion Theology deemed to be &quot;too extreme.&quot; Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell began teaching at Robertson School of Government in 2017. The School of Divinity includes the theologian Graham Twelftree, Dean Emeritus H. Vinson Synan, Pentecostal theologian Amos Yong, and church historian Stanley M. Burgess. The late J. Rodman Williams was professor emeritus. Former US representative Michele Bachmann became dean of the Robertson School of Government in 2021.

==Athletics==
Regent University&#x27;s athletic teams are known as the Royals. The primary logo, known as the cipher, consists of the letter &quot;R&quot; adorned with a crown. The crown comes from the original crown used in the Regent University Crest representing the Lord&#x27;s sovereignty over all.

The Royals compete as a member of the National Christian Collegiate Athletic Association (NCCAA) in the South Region of the Division I level. Notable Royals include 3x National Champion Marelly Balentina who won the indoor and outdoor NCCAA National Championships for Track and Field in the Women&#x27;s Javelin and Shotput. Balentina was also Named 2022&#x27;s VASID women&#x27;s field athlete of the year. 

On September 1, 2024, Regent University began its exploratory year in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III. Regent&#x27;s exploratory year will last throughout the 2024–2025 academic year. Upon successful completion, the university will then apply for a three-year provisional membership. On November 19, 2024 the Royals joined the Coast to Coast Athletic Conference (C2C). The university will begin competing in the C2C during the 2025–2026 academic year. 

Regent competes in ten intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, baseball(added in 2024-25), cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball (added in 2024); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball.

<text>Jerome Robbins (born Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz; October 11, 1918 – July 29, 1998) was an American dancer, choreographer, film director, theatre director and producer who worked in classical ballet, on stage, film, and television.

Among his numerous stage productions were &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;High Button Shoes&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;The Pajama Game&quot;, &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. Robbins was a five-time Tony Award-winner and a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors. He received two Academy Awards, including the 1961 Academy Award for Best Director with Robert Wise for &quot;West Side Story&quot; and a special Academy Honorary Award for his choreographic achievements on film.

A documentary about Robbins&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Something to Dance About&quot;, featuring excerpts from his journals, archival performance and rehearsal footage, and interviews with Robbins and his colleagues, premiered on PBS in 2009 and won both an Emmy and a Peabody Award the same year.

==Early life==
Robbins was born Jerome Wilson Rabinowitz in the Jewish Maternity Hospital at 270 East Broadway on Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side – a neighborhood populated by many immigrants. He was the son of Lena Robbins (née Rips) and Harry Rabinowitz (1887-1977). He had an older sister, Sonia (1912-2004).

The Rabinowitz family lived in a large apartment house at 51 East 97th Street at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue. Known as &quot;Jerry&quot; to those close to him, Robbins was given the middle name Wilson reflecting his parents&#x27; patriotic enthusiasm for the then-president, Woodrow Wilson.

In the early 1920s, the Rabinowitz family moved to Weehawken, New Jersey. His father and uncle opened the Comfort Corset Company in nearby Union City. He graduated in 1935 from Woodrow Wilson High School (since renamed as Weehawken High School). The family had many show business connections, including vaudeville performers and theater owners. In the 1940s, their name was legally changed to Robbins.

Robbins began studying modern dance in high school with Alys [CK] Bentley, who encouraged her pupils to improvise steps to music. Said Robbins later: &quot;What [she] gave me immediately was the absolute freedom to make up my own dances without inhibition or doubts.&quot; After graduation he went to study chemistry at New York University (NYU) but dropped out after a year for financial reasons, and to pursue dance full-time. He joined the company of Senya Gluck Sandor, a leading exponent of expressionistic modern dance; it was Sandor who recommended that he change his name to Robbins. Sandor also encouraged him to take ballet, which he did with Ella Daganova; in addition he studied Spanish dancing with Helen Veola; Asian dance with Yeichi Nimura; and dance composition with Bessie Schonberg. While a member of Sandor&#x27;s company Robbins made his stage debut with the Yiddish Art Theater, in a small role in &quot;The Brothers Ashkenazi&quot;.

==Career==
===1930s and 40s===

In 1937 Robbins made the first of many appearances as a dancer at Camp Tamiment, a resort in the Poconos known for its weekly Broadway-style revues; and he began dancing in the choruses of Broadway shows, including &quot;Great Lady&quot; and &quot;Keep Off the Grass&quot;, both choreographed by George Balanchine. Robbins had also begun creating dances for Tamiment&#x27;s Revues, some of them comic (featuring the talents of Imogene Coca and Carol Channing) and some dramatic, topical, and controversial. One such dance, later also performed in New York City at the 92nd Street Y, was &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, set to the song of the same name sung by Billie Holiday.

In 1940, Robbins joined Ballet Theatre (later known as American Ballet Theatre). From 1941 through 1944, Robbins was a soloist with the company, attracting notice for his performance as Hermes in &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;, the title role in &quot;Petrouchka&quot;, the Youth in Agnes de Mille&#x27;s &quot;Three Virgins and a Devil&quot;, and Benvolio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; he also came under the influence of the choreographers Michel Fokine, Antony Tudor, and George Balanchine.
During this period, Robbins created &quot;Fancy Free&quot;, a ballet with a screwball-comedy plot about sailors on leave that combined classical ballet with 1940s social dancing. He performed in it when it was presented at the Metropolitan Opera as part of the Ballet Theatre&#x27;s 1944 season. He said that one of his inspirations for this ballet had been Paul Cadmus&#x27;s 1934 painting &quot;The Fleet&#x27;s In!&quot;, even though it was lighthearted, which the painting decidedly was not. Robbins said in an interview with &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;: &quot;After seeing ... &quot;Fleet&#x27;s In&quot;, which I inwardly rejected though it gave me the idea of doing the ballet, I watched sailors, and girls, too, all over town.&quot; Robbins commissioned the score for the ballet from Leonard Bernstein, who was a relatively unknown composer at the time. He also enlisted Oliver Smith as set designer.

Later that year, Robbins conceived and choreographed &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944), a musical partly inspired by &quot;Fancy Free&quot;, which effectively launched his Broadway career. Bernstein wrote the music and Smith designed the sets. The book and lyrics were written by a team that Robbins would work with again, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, and the director was the Broadway legend George Abbott. Because Robbins, as choreographer, insisted that his chorus reflect the racial diversity of a New York City crowd, &quot;On the Town&quot; broke the color bar on Broadway for the first time. Robbins&#x27;s next musical was a jazz-age fable, &quot;Billion Dollar Baby&quot; (1945). During rehearsals for it, an incident happened that became a part of Robbins – and Broadway – lore: the choreographer, preoccupied by giving directions to the dancers, backed up onstage until he fell into the orchestra pit. Two years later, Robbins received plaudits for his humorous Mack Sennett ballet, &quot;High Button Shoes&quot; (1947), and won his first Tony Award for choreography. That same year, Robbins would become one of the first members of New York City&#x27;s newly formed Actors Studio, attending classes held by founding member Robert Lewis three times a week, alongside classmates including Marlon Brando, Maureen Stapleton, Montgomery Clift, Herbert Berghof, Sidney Lumet, and about 20 others. In 1948 he added another credit to his resume, becoming co-director as well as choreographer for &quot;Look Ma, I&#x27;m Dancin&#x27;!&quot;; the year after that he teamed with Irving Berlin to choreograph &quot;Miss Liberty&quot;.

While he was forging a career on Broadway, Robbins continued to work in ballet, creating a string of inventive and stylistically diverse ballets, including &quot;Interplay&quot;, which was set to a score by Morton Gould, and &quot;Facsimile&quot;, which was set to music by Leonard Bernstein and was banned in Boston [CK]. In 1949 Robbins left Ballet Theatre to join George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein&#x27;s newly formed New York City Ballet as Associate Artistic Director. Soon after that he choreographed &quot;The Guests,&quot; a ballet about intolerance.

===1950s===
At New York City Ballet Robbins distinguished himself immediately as both dancer and choreographer. He was noted for his performances in Balanchine&#x27;s 1929 &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (revived expressly for him), Til Eulenspiegel, and (with Tanaquil LeClercq) Bouree Fantasque, as well as for his own ballets, such as Age of Anxiety, The Cage, Afternoon of a Faun, and The Concert, in all of which LeClercq played leading roles. He continued working on Broadway, as well as, staging dances for Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Call Me Madam&quot;, starring Ethel Merman, Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;The King and I,&quot; in which he created the celebrated &quot;Small House of Uncle Thomas&quot; ballet in addition to other dances, and the revue Two&#x27;s Company, starring Bette Davis.

He also performed uncredited show doctoring on the musicals &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1951), &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1952), &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), and choreographed and directed several sketches for The Ford 50th Anniversary Show, starring Mary Martin and Ethel Merman on CBS.

In 1954, Robbins collaborated with George Abbott on &quot;The Pajama Game&quot; (1954), which launched the career of Shirley MacLaine, and created, choreographed, and directed the Mary Martin vehicle, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (which he re-staged for an Emmy Award-winning television special in 1955, earning himself a nomination for best choreography). He also directed and co-choreographed (with Bob Fosse) &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1956), starring Judy Holliday. Robbins recreated his stage dances for The King and I for the 1956 film version. In 1957, he conceived, choreographed, and directed &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

&quot;West Side Story&quot; is a contemporary version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, set on the Upper West Side. The show, with music by Leonard Bernstein, marked the first collaboration between Robbins and Stephen Sondheim, who wrote the lyrics, as well as Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book. Because book, music, and dance were envisioned as an organic whole, the cast, in a Broadway first, had to be equally skilled as actors, singers, and dancers. To help the young cast grow into their roles, Robbins did not allow those playing members of opposite gangs (Jets and Sharks) to mix during the rehearsal process. He also, according to dancer Linda Talcott Lee, &quot;played psychological games&quot; with the cast: &quot;And he would plant rumors among one gang about the other, so they really hated each other.&quot; Although it opened to good reviews, it was overshadowed by Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;The Music Man&quot; at that year&#x27;s Tony Awards. &quot;West Side Story&quot; did, however, earn Robbins his second Tony Award for choreography.

The streak of hits continued with &quot;&quot; (1959), starring Ethel Merman. Robbins re-teamed with Sondheim and Laurents, and the music was by Jule Styne. The musical is based (loosely) on the life of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee.

In 1956 Robbins&#x27;s muse, Tanaquil LeClercq, contracted polio and was paralyzed; for the next decade Robbins largely withdrew from his activities at New York City Ballet, but he established his own small dance company, Ballets USA, which premiered at the inaugural season of Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s Festival of the Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy in June 1958, toured Europe and the US under the auspices of the State Department, and appeared on television on The Ed Sullivan Show. Among the dances he created for Ballets USA were N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz and Moves.

==== House Un-American Activities Committee ====
In 1950, Robbins was called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), suspected of Communist sympathies. Robbins, though willing to confess to past party membership, resisted naming names of others with similar political connections; he held out for three years until, according to two family members in whom he confided, he was threatened with public exposure of his homosexuality. Robbins named the names of persons he said were Communists, including actors Lloyd Gough and Elliot Sullivan, dance critic Edna Ocko, filmmaker Lionel Berman, playwright Jerome Chodorov, his brother Edward Chodorov, Madeline Lee Gilford and her husband Jack Gilford, who were blacklisted for their perceived political beliefs and had their careers suffer noticeably, to the point Gilford and his wife often had to borrow money from friends to make ends meet. Because he cooperated with HUAC, Robbins&#x27;s career did not visibly suffer and he was not blacklisted.

===1960s===

In 1960, Robbins co-directed, with Robert Wise, the film adaptation of &quot;West Side Story&quot;. After about 45 days of shooting, he was fired when the production was considered 24 days behind schedule. However, when the film received 10 Academy Awards for the 1961 award year, Robbins won two, one for his Direction and one for &quot;Brilliant Achievements in the Art of Choreography on Film&quot;.

In 1962, Robbins directed Arthur Kopit&#x27;s non-musical play &quot;Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma&#x27;s Hung You in the Closet and I&#x27;m Feelin&#x27; So Sad&quot;. The production ran over a year off-Broadway and was transferred to Broadway for a short run in 1963, after which Robbins directed Anne Bancroft in a revival of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;.

Robbins was still highly sought after as a show doctor. He took over the direction of two troubled productions during this period and helped turn them into successes. In 1962, he saved &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1962), a musical farce starring Zero Mostel, Jack Gilford, David Burns, and John Carradine. The production, with book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart, and score by Stephen Sondheim, was not working. Sondheim wrote and Robbins staged an entirely new opening number, &quot;Comedy Tonight&quot;, which explained to the audience what was to follow, and the show played successfully from then on. In 1964, he took on a floundering &quot;Funny Girl&quot; and devised a show that ran 1348 performances. The musical helped turn lead Barbra Streisand into a superstar.

That same year, Robbins won Tony Awards for his direction and choreography in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1964). The show starred Zero Mostel as Tevye and ran for 3242 performances, setting the record (since surpassed) for longest-running Broadway show. The plot, about Jews living in Russia near the beginning of the 20th century, allowed Robbins to return to his religious roots.

===1970s and 1980s===
He continued to choreograph and stage productions for both the Joffrey Ballet and the New York City Ballet into the 1970s. Robbins became ballet master of the New York City Ballet in 1972 and worked almost exclusively in classical dance throughout the next decade, pausing only to stage revivals of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1980) and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; (1981). In 1981, his Chamber Dance Company toured the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

The 1980s saw an increased presence on TV as NBC aired &quot;Live From Studio 8H: An Evening of Jerome Robbins&#x27; Ballets&quot; with members of the New York City Ballet, and a retrospective of Robbins&#x27;s choreography aired on PBS in a 1986 installment of &quot;Dance in America&quot;. The latter led to his creating the anthology show &quot;Jerome Robbins&#x27; Broadway&quot; in 1989 which recreated the most successful production numbers from his 50-plus year career. Starring Jason Alexander as the narrator (a performance that would win Alexander a Tony), the show included stagings of cut numbers like Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Monotony&quot; and well-known ones like the &quot;Tradition&quot; number from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. He was awarded a fifth Tony Award for it.

=== 1990s ===
Following a bicycle accident in 1990 and heart-valve surgery in 1994, in 1996 he began showing signs of a form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and his hearing was quickly deteriorating. He nevertheless staged &quot;Les Noces&quot; for City Ballet in 1998, his last project.

===Death===
Robbins suffered a stroke in July 1998, two months after the premiere of his re-staging of &quot;Les Noces&quot;. He died at his home in New York on July 29, 1998. On the evening of his death, the lights of Broadway were dimmed for a moment in tribute. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered on the Atlantic Ocean.

== Personal life ==
Robbins had romantic relationships with a number of people, including Montgomery Clift, Nora Kaye, Buzz Miller, and Jess Gerstein.
As a former Communist Party member, he named 10 communists in his testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Although he gave this testimony only after years of pressure, and threats to make public his sexual orientation, his naming names caused resentment among some of his artistic colleagues, including blacklisted actors Jack Gilford and Zero Mostel, who, while working on &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; &quot;openly disdained Robbins&quot;. Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents worked with him on &quot;West Side Story&quot; only a few years after they had been blacklisted.

== Awards ==

Robbins shared the Academy Award for Best Director with Robert Wise for the film version of &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961). Robbins was only the second director to win the Academy Award for Best Director for a film debut (after Delbert Mann for &quot;Marty&quot;). That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences honored him with a special Academy Honorary Award for his choreographic achievements on film.

In all, he was awarded with five Tony Awards, two Academy Awards (including the special Academy Honorary Award), the Kennedy Center Honors (1981), the National Medal of Arts (1988), the French Legion of Honor, and an Honorary Membership in the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.
He was awarded three honorary doctorates including an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1980 from the City University of New York and an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts from New York University in 1985.

Jerome Robbins was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1979. Robbins was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame 10 years later, in 1989.

===Jerome Robbins Award===
In 1995, Jerome Robbins instructed the directors of his foundation to establish a prize for &quot;some really greatly outstanding person or art institution. The prizes should &quot;lean toward the arts of dance...&quot; The first two Jerome Robbins Awards were bestowed in 2003 to New York City Ballet and to lighting designer Jennifer Tipton.

<text>Neyland is a town and community in Pembrokeshire, Wales, lying on the River Cleddau and the upstream end of the Milford Haven estuary. The Cleddau Bridge carrying the A477 links Pembroke Dock with Neyland. In 2011 it had a population of 3464.

== Etymology ==
The name of the town is a reduction of an earlier form of the English word &#x27; preceded by the Middle English &#x27; &quot;at the&quot;. It was formerly known as New Milford by contrast with Milford Haven.

==History==


Neyland was a small fishing village in the parish of Llanstadwell, but in 1856 it became the site for the western terminus of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Great Western Railway with a transatlantic terminal for the largest ships of the time. It was selected instead of the other possible location Abermawr. The town then grew rapidly to serve the port.

The construction of a more substantial port at Goodwick based on an earlier plan of 1846, was revived in 1899, and opened in 1906. Many people relocated from Neyland to Goodwick and Fishguard at that time. Neyland was partially reprieved because silting of Goodwick harbour restricted its use, and for a little over one hundred years, Neyland was a busy rail and sea port. The Neyland terminal ceased operation in 1964.

The rail terminus used to link with the ferry that crossed the Cleddau to Hobbs Point in Pembroke Dock until 1975 when the Cleddau Bridge opened. The redevelopment of the 1980s saw the creation of a new marina and rehabilitation of the old railway yard. Some of the original Brunel iron wide gauge railway tracks can be seen today in use as safety barriers around the quay.

In August 2010, an 8 ft bronze statue of Brunel was stolen from its site in the town&#x27;s marina, presumably for its metallurgic value. It was later replaced.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Neyland, at community (town) and county level: Neyland Town Council and Pembrokeshire County Council. The town council is based at the Community Hub on John Street, which opened in 2020.

Until 1900, Neyland was part of the parish of Llanstadwell. When parish and district councils were established in 1894, the parish of Llanstadwell was included in the Pembroke Rural District. On 1 October 1900 a parish of Neyland was created from part of Llanstadwell, and the new parish was declared to be an urban district, making it independent from the Pembroke Rural District Council. Neyland Urband District Council held its first meeting on 15 October 1900 at the town&#x27;s board school, when Anthony James, a Liberal, was appointed the first chairman of the council. The urban district council later acquired premises at 60–62 High Street in the mid 1960s, which then served as a town hall until 2018.

Neyland Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, with the area becoming part of Preseli Pembrokeshire in 1974. Preseli Pembrokeshire in turn was abolished in 1996 to become part of a re-established Pembrokeshire.

==Sport and leisure==
Sporting groups include Neyland Cricket Club (a founder member of the Pembroke County Cricket Club) established in 1889, Neyland RFC (a rugby union club established in 1885) and Neyland AFC.
The town has a yacht club and a marina.
The Pembrokeshire Coast National Park is nearby.

==Public services==
Potable water is supplied to the town by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW).
There were gas works alongside the railway. In 1909 it was the site of an explosion which burnt to death a mother and her three-year-old daughter who was taken there to inhale the fumes for the benefit of her health.

*Lord Gordon Parry of Neyland (1925–2004), Labour politician
*Sarah Waters (born 1966), novelist, &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;
*Barry John (born ca. 1974), artist, soldier

<text>Birsay () (Old Norse: &quot;Birgisherað&quot;) is a parish in the north west corner of The Mainland of Orkney, Scotland. Almost all the land in the parish is devoted to agriculture: chiefly grassland used to rear beef cattle. There are various ancient monuments in the parish.

==Ancient monuments==
Two important ancient monuments are maintained by Historic Scotland and bring many visitors to the area in summer. These are the prehistoric and Norse settlements on the tidal island of Brough of Birsay and the ruins of the Earl&#x27;s Palace on the Mainland opposite, at the northern end of the village.

On the western part of Mainland Orkney&#x27;s north shore there is other evidence of prehistoric man, including the well preserved ruins of the Broch of Gurness.

==Earl&#x27;s Palace==
The late 16th-century palace was built by Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney (1533–93). Though extensively ruined, it can be seen to have consisted of four ranges round an open courtyard, with small towers at the corners, an unusual form of building in Scotland at this date, and unprecedented in the north of the country. The date 1574 was formerly carved above the main (south-facing) entrance. The building has been uninhabited since the late 17th century. It was originally adjoined by walled garden enclosures, an archery range and a bowling green. This building, along with the Earl&#x27;s Palace, Kirkwall and Scalloway Castle in Shetland (all Historic Scotland), were the main residences of the Stewart Earls of Orkney in the Northern Isles.

==St Magnus Church==

Near the palace is the St Magnus Church of the parish of Birsay and Harray (Church of Scotland; open in summer). Architectural fragments in the walls, and archaeological investigation of the foundations, suggest that this was the site of the first cathedral of Orkney in the 11th-12th centuries, known as &quot;Christchurch&quot;, founded by Earl Thorfinn the Mighty (d. ) after his return from a pilgrimage to Rome. The seat of the diocese was transferred to St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, in the later 12th century, though the Bishops of Orkney continued to have a residence in Birsay (known by the Latin name &quot;Mons Bellus&quot;) into late medieval times.

The nearby bridge may also be medieval in origin.

==Notable people==

* Samuel Trail was minister of the parish 1844 to 1868. He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1874.
* Harald Leslie, Lord Birsay

<text>Glanamman () is a mining village in the valley of the River Amman in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Glanamman has long been a stronghold of the Welsh language; village life is largely conducted in Welsh. Like the neighbouring village of Garnant it experienced a coal-mining boom in the 19th and early 20th centuries, but the last big colliery closed in 1947 and coal has been extracted fitfully since then.

==History==
The location of Garnant and Glanamman was known as Cwmamman (&quot;Amman valley&quot;) before coal was discovered; until the 18th century it was a remote wilderness with just a few farms and rough mountain roads. Mining appears to have started at Brynlloi in 1757 and small coal workings proliferated in the first half of the 19th century. The arrival of the railway in 1840 meant that coal could be exported on an industrial scale through Llanelli docks, and the construction of two stations at Glanamman and Garnant promoted a distinction between the two communities.

Taking its name from the emblem of the Dynevor family, the &quot;Raven&quot; colliery in Garnant was operating by 1854. In 1891, the Gelliceidrim Collieries Company opened what became the largest of the coal mines at Glanamman, employing 632 men in 1932. &quot;The Gelly&quot; was nationalised in 1947 and closed in 1957. Since then the area has seen some small private mines come and go, such as a drift mine on Grenig Road in the 1970s.

== Government ==
Cwmamman, the old name for the location of Glanamman and Garnant, was revived for the urban council covering the two villages which now have much smaller populations than in their heyday at the turn of the 20th century. Today Cwmaman Town Council forms the lowest tier of government, comprising 15 community councillors.

Glanamman is also the name of the county electoral ward covering the area around Glannaman village. The ward elects a county councillor to Carmarthenshire County Council.

Glanamman is in the unitary authority of Carmarthenshire. Adam Price of Plaid Cymru currently represents the village at the Welsh Assembly in the constituency of Carmarthen East and Dinefwr.The constituency is represented in Westminster by Jonathan Edwards, Independent, formerly of Plaid Cymru.

== Geography ==
The village is about north of Swansea on the edge of the Black Mountain, in the westernmost part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. The River Amman flows through the village. Glanamman lies in the western part of the South Wales Coalfield, where the coal is particularly high-quality anthracite.

== Demography ==
The effect of the mining boom can be seen in the expansion of Cwmamman parish (including Garnant and surrounding villages) from just over 3,000 in 1851 to over 11,000 in the early 20th century. The population had declined to 2,261 people at the 2001 census, increasing to 2,347 at the 2011 Census. Garnant is a similar size.

== Economy ==
Traditionally the economy was based on coal-mining with some dairy farming, but the mines have closed and farms such as Gelli Fanwen have moved from milk production to beef-farming. The Raven Tinplate Works (sometimes confused with the Amman Tinplate Works in Garnant) were built on the site of the Cwmamman Brickworks in 1881. They operated until the early 1930s and were demolished after World War II; the site is now a council depot near the station.

== Culture and community ==
Since 1988 Cwmamman has been twinned with the village of Pouldergat, in Brittany. The village is a stronghold of the Welsh language, with 81% of the population able to speak it.

The first chain driven Bicycle in Wales and one of the first in the World was manufactured by the Defiance Cycle Company Glanamman and ridden to Swansea in 1885. This is commemorated on Easter Monday by retracing the same ride to Swansea.

== Landmarks ==
The valley has been shaped by coal workings and their waste, but little remains above ground. Brynseion Chapel&#x27;s location at the corner of the High Street and the main road marks the centre of the village, but both it and Saint Margaret&#x27;s Church (see below) are now closed.

== Transport ==
A turnpike road (now the A474) was constructed along the valley in 1817. The Llanelly Railway and Dock Company built the Llanelly Railway to Garnant in 1840. It was taken over by the GWR on amalgamation in 1923, and closed to passenger services by British Railways on 18 August 1958. Freight traffic continued until the closure of the Abernant Colliery in 1988. The Amman Valley Railway Society are seeking to restore the Abernant branch line as part of the Swansea 9 Lines project.

== Education ==
Glanamman used to have a primary school which opened in 1884 and closed in 2005. Glanamman was a category A, or Welsh medium school with most subjects taught in Welsh. Three local schools, Ysgol y Twyn, Ysgol Gynradd y Garnant and Ysgol Gynradd Glanaman, were merged to form Ysgol y Bedol (the Horseshoe School) on the north bank of the three rivers in Garnant. This primary school for ages 3–11 was opened in 2005. Ysgol y Bedol is also a Welsh medium school. The nearest secondary school is Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Ammanford.

== Religious sites ==

The Welsh valleys have long been hotbeds of Nonconformism and Glanamman was no exception. Old Bethel Chapel, also known as The Old Meeting House, was built in 1773 high on the north side of the valley between Glanamman and Garnant. The Tabernacle Calvinistic Methodist Chapel and the Bethesda Baptist Chapel followed in 1840 and 1882 respectively. The prosperity at the turn of the 20th century can be seen in the ornate facade of the Bethania Calvinistic Methodist Chapel (1906–7) on Brynlloi Road and in the large Gothic-tinged Brynseion Independent Chapel (1909–10) nearby; Brynseion closed in 2004. Ammanford, a few miles down the valley, was a centre of the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival which saw thousands of new converts.

Anglicans worshipped at Christchurch in nearby Garnant during the 19th century but as with the Methodists they were prompted by the Revival to found a church in Glanamman itself. Saint Margaret&#x27;s Church started in what is now the church hall, a corrugated iron building on Tirycoed Road, dedicated in 1907. The foundation stone of a new building was laid on 22 April 1933 and the church was dedicated on 1 November by the Lord Bishop of St. Davids. A lack of funds for essential repairs meant that the last regular service took place on Christmas Day 2008, but it is hoped to use the church for special services in future.

== Sport ==
Garnant Park (formerly Cwmamman Recreation Ground) was part of Lord Dynevor&#x27;s Glanrafon Farm estate just east of Glanamman. It is home to Amman United RFC which was founded in 1903 and is a feeder club for the Scarlets regional team. Players who have gone on to rugby at international level include Claude Davey, Tom Day and Trevor Evans of the British Lions. Rugby international Shane Williams bought a disused industrial unit on Station Road which he converted into a CrossFit-franchised gym with bike hire and other facilities (now closed).

== Notable people ==
Those born or raised in Glanamman include:

* Arthur and William Williams, 19th C. founders of Defiance Cycle Company, the first cycle factory in Wales.

<doc id="663564" wikidata="Q2588758" url="?curid=663564" title="Sword of Mana">
<text>Sword of Mana, originally released in Japan as , is a 2003 action role-playing game developed by Square Enix and Brownie Brown and published by Square Enix and Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. It is an enhanced remake of the first game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, the Game Boy game &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden&quot;, which was released as &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; in North America and as &quot;Mystic Quest&quot; in Europe. &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; was the fifth release in the series. Set in a high fantasy universe, the game follows an unnamed hero and heroine as they seek to defeat the Dark Lord and defend the Mana Tree from enemies who wish to misuse its power.

While incorporating gameplay elements from the original game and generally following the same plot, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has new gameplay mechanics and a much more involved story. It removes elements of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series present in the original game as a marketing ploy, while adding in gameplay elements and artistic styles from later games in the series. The plot is modified to allow the player to follow the parallel stories of either the hero or the heroine, and the backstory and dialogue is expanded from the original. &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; was produced by series creator Koichi Ishii, directed by Takeo Oin, and largely developed by employees of Brownie Brown who had previously worked on the series for Square.

The game received weakly positive reviews from critics. Reviewers praised the graphics of the game, as well as its enhancements to the original version. They were generally dismissive of the plot, even with enhancements, and disliked elements of the gameplay, especially the computer-controlled ally. Critics recommended the game mainly to fans of the genre or the series. &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; received a second remake in 2016, &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The gameplay of &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; is an expanded and modified version of the gameplay of the action role-playing game &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, with elements added from later games in the &quot;Mana&quot; series. Like previous games in the series, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; displays a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. Unlike the original game, the terrain is in color, is not composed of square tiles, and the player is not restricted to moving only in the cardinal directions. At the beginning of the game the player chooses to follow the story of either the unnamed hero or heroine, and controls them thereafter. The player is often joined by either the unchosen protagonist or by temporary companions, and at any point during battles can choose to take direct control of the other party member instead of their chosen character. The non-selected character is controlled via artificial intelligence. Unlike prior games in the series, &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; does not have a direct multiplayer component. Instead, players can connect their Game Boy Advances together via a Link Cable to give their characters powerful attacks to be used at a later time, known as the &quot;Amigo&quot; system. The original game featured no multiplayer capabilities.

The two main characters have different capabilities. Both are capable of using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks. Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and are affected by the weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the bottom of the screen is an overdrive gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.

The player can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game&#x27;s Ring Commands, a circular menu which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The Ring Command menu, which lets the player pause the game in combat to select different weapons, spells, and items, was not present in the original game, but was present in the sequels &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Trials of Mana&quot;. A version of the day-and-night system introduced in &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; was added to the game, whereby some enemies are only present at different times of day, which changes whenever the player enters a new area. Much like &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, players can forge weapons and plant produce in an orchard in the game&#x27;s &quot;Hot House&quot; feature.

==Plot==
&quot;Sword of Mana&quot; has a similar story to &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; with additional details and dialogue added. The player has the choice to follow the story of either the hero or the heroine, who are named by the player, instead of only the hero as in the original game. The two stories parallel each other, and the two protagonists are often together.

The hero&#x27;s story begins with a flashback dream of the death of his parents at the hands of the Dark Lord, the ruler of the nation of Granz. Upon waking, the hero, a gladiator-slave in Granz, attempts to escape before being confronted by the Dark Lord and thrown off of a bridge. After being fished out of a lake, the hero is advised to head to the city of Topple. The heroine&#x27;s story also begins with a flashback dream of the Dark Lord and his assistant, Julius, killing her stepmother and destroying her village. Upon awaking, she is advised by the knight Bogard to head to Topple, while he journeys to the city of Wendell. The hero and heroine meet in Topple, and agree to journey together. They head toward Wendell, and along the way discover that women of the Mana tribe, which the heroine belongs to, are being kidnapped by vampires. The heroine is kidnapped, and is rescued by the hero and an unnamed man; they discover that the kidnappings are to keep the woman safe from the Dark Lord and Julius, who are killing them all in part because the tribe was unable to save the Dark Lord&#x27;s mother from a terrible fate.

In Wendell, the two protagonists learn that Bogard and several other knights were instrumental in overthrowing the Vandole Empire twenty years prior, which had been abusing Mana, the source of magic. The hero states his intention to find the legendary Mana Sword in order to avenge his parents and the heroine reveals she has a pendant from her stepmother that is the key to the Mana Tree, the source of Mana. The unnamed man then reveals himself to be Julius and kidnaps the heroine for the pendant; during a failed rescue attempt the hero falls from an airship along with the pendant. After a side story resulting in the hero and heroine killing the Dark Lord&#x27;s mother, who had been turned into a monster, the pendant is stolen and given to the Dark Lord. The protagonists chase after him. After the two defeat the Dark Lord, Julius reveals himself to be the last survivor of the Vandole Empire. Once gaining the pendant he mind controlled the heroine to use the pendant to give him control of the Mana Tree, which Vandole had attempted to do prior to being overthrown. Julius defeats the hero and heroine, and heads off to the Mana Tree.

The hero and heroine split up to find the Mana Sword. After the hero passes trials to prove himself worthy of the sword, which first appears as a rusty blade, the two join forces to storm the Mana Tree and defeat Julius. They do so, but the tree is killed in the process; prior to death, the tree reveals that she was the heroine&#x27;s mother, and asks the heroine to replace her as the next Mana Tree. The heroine agrees, and the two protagonists part ways.

==Development==
===Origin===
After the release of the previous game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Legend of Mana&quot;, several members of the development team for the game left Square to form a new development studio, Brownie Brown. These included character designer Kameoka Shinichi and lead artist Kouji Tsuda, as well as several other writers and artists. The crew that stayed was merged with those behind &quot;Parasite Eve II&quot;, &quot;Brave Fencer Musashi&quot; and &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; to make &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;. Square, in turn, outsourced development of the fifth game in the &quot;Mana&quot; series to Brownie Brown. The producer for the game was Square&#x27;s Koichi Ishii, who had directed or designed the previous games in the series. Ishii had served as the director for the original game in the series, &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;, of which &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; is a remake.

===Game design===
The remake, in addition to adding enhanced graphics to the original Game Boy title, sought to add elements present in later games in the series, such as the Ring Command menu system, and to expand the game&#x27;s storyline. It also removed elements from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, which had been placed in the original game as a part of the marketing for the game before its sequels moved to be a distinct series. The ability to play as the heroine was added, and an element of multiplayer features that the series had become known for was added by allowing two players to link their Game Boy Advances together to trade items.

===Character design===
The hero was designed to show a lot of skin in order to convey his slave status. To help the character stand out when converted to pixel art design, cross patterns were added to the back of his gloves and his shoulder pads. For the heroine, her design was guided to make her look both like a warrior and a princess. Bogard, who in &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; has a &quot;gentlemanly&quot; look was made to look more like a ruffian or hermit.

The Eight Mana Spirits were designed to look like three-dimensional characters from a storybook. In order to hide the Dark Lord’s identity, a mask was designed so that this aspect of the plot could remain hidden until later on in the game. Game illustrator Shinichi Kameoka stated that he was told to design Julius to look like a neutral character. Kameoka stated he also tried to make Julius look “like a girl”.

==Release==
Square announced in August 2002 that a &quot;Mana&quot; game for the Game Boy Advance was under development, and in early 2003 announced that the game was a remake of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; and would be released in Japan later that year under the name &quot;Shinyaku Seiken Densetsu&quot;. On April 24, 2003, Square Enix, formed from the merger of Square and Enix during the game&#x27;s development, announced that &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; would have North American and European releases as well. While &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; had been released worldwide, &quot;Trials of Mana&quot; had only been released in Japan. In July 2003, IGN listed the game as one of the top ten most anticipated Game Boy Advance games of 2003. &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; was released in Japan on August 29, 2003, in North America on December 1, and in Europe on March 18, 2004. In Japan, a special edition &quot;Mana Blue&quot;-colored Game Boy Advance SP was released on the same date as the game, packaged with &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; and a carrying case. Those who purchased the game&#x27;s soundtrack and strategy guide between August 27 and September 30, 2003, were given the opportunity to win a Cactus character cushion and a cellphone strap.

===Music===


The score for &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; was composed by Kenji Ito, the composer for the original &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;. The music includes reworked tracks from the original game as well as new material. Ito&#x27;s music is mainly inspired by images from the game rather than outside influences; however, he never played either the original game or the remake. The 2003 &quot;Sword of Mana Premium Soundtrack&quot; album collects 47 tracks of music from the game. The two-disc album contains over an hour and a half of music and was published by DigiCube, with a 2004 reprint by Square Enix. The first disc contains music directly from the game, while the second disc features seven piano arrangements by Ito of songs from the soundtrack. The first edition of the soundtrack included a bonus disc, containing an orchestral arrangement of &quot;Rising Sun ~ Endless Battlefield&quot;. The album reached position #118 on the Japan Oricon charts, and stayed on the charts for only one week. Music from the soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing. Additionally, KMP Music Publishing has published a book of sheet music for the piano tracks included in the album.

==Reception==
&quot;Sword of Mana&quot; sold over 277,000 copies in Japan in 2003. It received positive reviews from critics. The game&#x27;s presentation was praised, especially its graphics; Brad Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the &quot;lush, colorful backgrounds&quot; and animation quality, which was seconded by the reviewer for &quot;GamePro&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Justin Leeper also felt that the graphics were beautiful, and Shane Bettenhausen of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said it was &quot;one of the most stunning games on [the] GBA&quot;. Kevin Gifford of &quot;1UP.com&quot; also praised the graphics in relation to other Game Boy Advance games, while Darryl Vassar of &quot;GameSpy&quot; said that it would have been the best-looking Game Boy Advance game if were not for what he felt was poor animation quality. Reaction to the music was more mixed; while the reviews for &quot;Game Informer&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; praised it, Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; termed the music &quot;mostly bland&quot; and Craig Harris of &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpy&quot;&#x27;s Vassar said it was nice but repetitive. Reviewers also noted technical problems with the presentation: both the GameSpot and IGN reviews noted graphical glitches in the game as marring the presentation.

The game&#x27;s plot was widely dismissed; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Harris termed it &quot;a little on the basic side&quot; and &quot;borderline silly&quot;, which &quot;1UP.com&quot;&#x27;s Gifford amended to just &quot;silly&quot;, with &quot;needlessly-long dialogue&quot;. Vassar of &quot;GameSpy&quot; felt that the added dialogue simply unjustly inflated a simple story. Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;quaintly simplistic&quot;, while the &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; review said it was one of the biggest problems with the game.

Elements of the gameplay were also poorly received. The computer-controlled companion was almost universally derided: Bettenhausen of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said they were &quot;nearly useless&quot;, as did Gifford of &quot;1UP.com&quot;, Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; called them &quot;just plain dumb&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot;″s Harris said it was &quot;the absolute pits&quot; and &quot;definitely the weakest aspect&quot; of the game. The &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; reviews found issues with the combat mechanics, and the &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;IGN&quot; reviewers felt the game was too easy. &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s Gifford felt that the boss battles were too easy, and that the weapon-switching system was needlessly complicated. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Harris and &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Leeper found the day/night system to be odd and unnecessary, and Harris additionally felt that the multiplayer system was underwhelming. Shoemaker of &quot;GameSpot&quot; concluded that the game was &quot;pretty good&quot;, and recommended it for fans of the genre, while Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot; and Bettenhausen of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; said that it was &quot;decent&quot; and &quot;worth a look for fans&quot; of the series. The Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; said that it was a good update to &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; without innovating the gameplay much beyond the original game.

===Legacy===
&quot;Sword of Mana&quot; was adapted into manga form by author Shiro Amano and published by Enterbrain on February 25, 2004. Two novels based on the game were written by Matsui Oohama with illustrations by Yumiko Murakami and were also published by Enterbrain on February 27, 2004. Square Enix also produced a book of yonkoma comics based on the game on January 16, 2004. &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot; received a second remake in 2016, &quot;Adventures of Mana&quot;.

<doc id="663576" wikidata="Q2741540" url="?curid=663576" title="Gorseinon">
<text>Gorseinon is a town within the City and County of Swansea, Wales, near the Loughor estuary. It was a small village until the late 19th century when it grew around the coal mining and tinplate industries. It is situated in the north west of Swansea City Centre, around north west of the city centre. Gorseinon is a local government community with an elected town council.

The population of the Gorseinon town council area in the 2011 Census is 8,693. However, the ONS defines an area called the Gorseinon Urban Area which comprises all of the continuous built up area in and around Gorseinon. This area includes Gorseinon, Loughor, Garden Village and Penllergaer and has a population of 20,581.

== Etymology ==
The name Gorseinon means &quot;Einon&#x27;s marsh&quot;, from the soft mutated form of Welsh &#x27; &quot;marsh&quot; and the male personal name &#x27;, the identity of whom is uncertain. Einon is the southern form of the name Einion. The initial soft mutation is irregular, and one would expect Corseinon. The short name of the village in Welsh is Y Gors (the marsh). Here the soft mutation is entirely regular (occurring when a feminine noun follows the definite article), and it may have spurred the change of Corseinon to Gorseinon. A &quot;standard&quot; form of the name, Corseinion, is seen in an appeal to his fellow tinplate workers by Y Cymro Coch in 1882.

==History==

===Religious development===

In 1840 the population of Gorseinon was barely 250 people. There were then two churches in the area. One was St Teilo&#x27;s Church, Llandeilo Tal-y-bont, also known as the “Church on the Marsh” – this has now been rebuilt in the St Fagans National History Museum in Cardiff. The other church was Brynteg Chapel, the only non-conformist chapel for miles, which was built in 1815 and still stands.

Several churches and chapels were built in the 1880s. The first church in the town was Holy Trinity Church, built in 1882 and extended in 1884. Seion Baptist Church opened in 1886, built on a riverbank at the bottom of Gorseinon, but by 1902 a new Seion was built in the High Street. The old Seion was taken over by the English Methodists, but this eventually became the Moose Hall. Bethel English Congregational Church (Evangelical) was built in 1894. West Street Bethel Chapel in Masons Road was built as an English Congregationalist church. Ebenezer, the Welsh Congregational Chapel opened in 1887, but by 1909 a new chapel was built near Seion Capel.

St. Catherine&#x27;s Church was built in 1913 and the Salvation Army church in 1910. A Roman Catholic church in Pontardulais Road was built in 1932 and a new church was built on Alexandra Road in the 1960s, designed by the architect Robert Robinson, a local Gower man. There is also a Christadelphian meeting hall in the town.

===Agricultural and industrial development===

Gors Eynon first appeared on an Ordnance Survey map in 1813, but by 1830 the name appeared in its modern spelling.

The monks of Neath Abbey paid many visits to this locality, and evidence of this were several mills built on the banks of local rivers; Cadle Mill, on the Lliw, Pontlliw, Melyn Mynach, and Loughor Mill.

There was one weaving mill and two flour mills on the river. These were worked by the monks to provide food and clothing for the Abbey, wool being brought here from Gower sheeplands.

By the end of the thirteenth century the monks at Melyn Mynach owned vast acreage devoted to sheep farming. They produced high quality wool at Cwrt Y Carnau, which was traded in Flanders and Italy.

With the arrival of the black death and bubonic plague in the fourteenth century, labour became scarce and the monks were forced to sell or rent to the local farmers. Eventually, during Henry VIII&#x27;s reign, the few monks that were left were pensioned off, as their land passed into crown hands.

John Pryce, a legal gentleman, who was originally from the area but had moved to London, returned to raise a family at Cwrt Y Carne. In 1575 he purchased the manor and land, and also the mill at Melyn Mynach. The whole estate totalled over . Pryce tried to squeeze every penny out of his tenant farmers and many disputes followed. The Pryce family prospered and by the early eighteenth Century, the name had changed to Price.

The last owner of the Melyn Mynach was the husband of a Price family member. He was called Nathaniel Cameron – Mayor of Swansea. He also owned the Mountain Colliery but sold the Mill after getting into financial difficulties to Mr. William Lewis, the founder of Gorseinon.

There were few industries but coal was plentiful. A drift was opened in 1846 and became known as “The Mountain Coal”. This coal was transported on a narrow gauge railway line to Loughor, where it was loaded onto barges and sent to Llanelli for transportation all around the world. The drift mine continued to be worked until 1900, when a shaft was sunk. Now known as the Mountain Colliery, it produced at its peak in excess of 200,000 tons of coal a year with a workforce in excess of 900. It was closed in 1969.

In 1860 the L.N.W.R. wanted to extend the line from Pontarddulais to Swansea. William Lewis, a young industrialist, sold them the land and a station was erected in 1870 – this became known as Gorseinon Station. The Mountain Colliery laid a siding from the Colliery to the Station and coal was redirected to Swansea Docks.

The first day-school was opened in 1880 at Penyrheol. The Headmaster, Mr. Jones, afterwards transferred to Gorseinon. As Gorseinon&#x27;s industries grew so did its housing and streets, with the development of Mill Street, Gorseinon Terrace, Eynon Street and High Street.

In 1886 the Grovesend Tin Works was built and the Lewis Family built many houses around the area to house the workers. The Grovesend Steelworks opened in 1890, but in 1891 all tinplate workers in South Wales were involved in a seven-month strike and times were very hard for the workers.

Gorseinon had two public houses, the Gorseinon Hotel (the Bottom Hotel) and the Station Hotel (the Gyp). It was said that the Bottom Hotel was for miners and the Gyp was for tinplate workers and it was a mortal sin to encroach on another man&#x27;s territory. Then in 1892 the West End Hotel was built and the Mardy in 1901 bring the number of public houses to four. The Gorseinon Hotel is no longer a pub but a ‘Seagers’ steakhouse restaurant.

Gorseinon Institute was opened in 1904 and in 1908 the Bryngwyn Sheetworks was opened

==Governance==
===County Council===
Prior to local government re-organisation in 1996, the town of Gorseinon was administered as part of the Lliw Valley district and previously Llwchwr Urban District Council. Since 1996, Gorseinon has been governed by the City and County of Swansea council and falls within the Gorseinon and Penyrheol wards of Swansea.

===Town Council===
The community of Gorseinon comprises the Gorseinon ward and the southern part of the Penyrheol ward. The Gorseinon Town Council developed from the former Gorseinon Community Council in 1998, since when it was able to appoint a town mayor annually. The council now comprises sixteen unpaid volunteers who are elected every four years. The council meet at Gorseinon Institute every first Wednesday to discuss local business and planning applications.

==Economy==
Gorseinon has a busy high street area in the centre of the town. The other major areas of employment are the nearby Garngoch Industrial estate, in Penllergaer, Gorseinon Business Park and Kingsbridge Business Park. Previously, the nearby Bryngwyn steel works and Valeo plant were major employers in the town, however they closed in the 1990s. In response to the closures, the National Assembly for Wales set up the Gorseinon Regeneration Strategy to invest in a number of regeneration schemes in the town.

A large Asda store opened in September 2010.

The Canolfan Gorseinon Centre was built on the old Bryngwyn Steel Works and is a charity-run, community-based centre. Several local charities and organisations are based here, including
* Gorseinon Development Trust 
* Gorseinon Food Bank
* Musicality – Academy of Performing Arts
* Gorseinon Food Festival
* Gorseinon Community Cinema
* Gorseinon Players

Gorseinon Development Trust is a locally-run charity that works on issues such as car parking, business, litter, historic areas, tourism and parks in the area.

===Twin town===
The town of Gorseinon along with the community of Llwchwr is twinned with Ploërmel, France.

==Facilities==
The town has local hospital, donated to the community prior to the establishment of the National Health Service by the local industrialist, (William) Rufus Lewis, who also established Parc y Werin People&#x27;s Park 

Gorseinon has a library, a district housing office and a post office.

==Sport and leisure==
*Gorseinon RFC play Rugby Union in WRU Division One West.
*Garden Village FC play in the Welsh Football League Division Two.
*Gorseinon Cricket Club play in the South Wales Cricket Association Division One.
*Gower Riders cycling club are based in the town and hold an annual cyclo-cross race at Melin Mynach in the town.
*Swansea Sharks roller hockey club play in the South Wales region of the BIPHA.
*Garngoch Golf Club, Gorseinon, operated between about 1930 and 1950.

Gorseinon hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1980.

For more than 50 years, Gorseinon was home to &#x27;La Charrette&#x27;, the UK&#x27;s smallest cinema, established by local electrician, the late Gwyn Phillips. Built from a disused railway carriage, the cinema opened in 1953; when the decay of its structure forced closure in February 2008, &#x27;La Charrette&#x27; was dismantled and taken to the Gower Heritage Centre. The last film shown at La Charette was a black-tie premiere of Danny Boyle&#x27;s Alien Love Triangle attended by Kenneth Branagh, who starred in the film, and organised by Observer film critic Mark Kermode.

The recently opened Canolfan Gorseinon Centre features a multi-use hall, training rooms, office room for small businesses, a creche and a bar and cafe.

==Education==
Gorseinon Primary School, which has three sites in the town, provides pre-school and primary education. There is a proposal to build a new primary school at Parc y Werin to replace the existing school buildings.

Most eleven to sixteen-year-old children in the area attend Penyrheol Comprehensive School. The school buildings were largely destroyed by an arson attack in 2006. The rebuilt school was opened in 2009.

One of the campuses of Gower College Swansea is in Gorseinon, providing further education and adult learning.

==Transport==
Gorseinon bus station is located just off West Street in the town centre. Bus services are provided by First Cymru with services to the surrounding villages and to Llanelli and Swansea city centre. The bus station was rebuilt making an improvement to the area. The town lost its train service in 1964 under the Beeching Axe; the nearest train station is now Gowerton railway station, to the south. 

The primary route through Gorseinon is the A4240 road which crosses the town centre as High Street and Alexandra Road. The A4240 connects Gorseinon with Llanelli to the west; and Penllergaer and the M4 Motorway (Junction 47) to the east.

==Geology==
===Bedrock Geology===

====Grovesend formation====

Gorseinon is built upon the Grovesend formation. Lithological characteristics are predominantly argillaceous, comprising mudstones and siltstones, with well developed coals; minor lithic (&quot;Pennant&quot;) sandstones; locally developed red mudstones in the type area. Description of the lower boundary of this formation is that the base is placed at the base of the Swansea Four-Feet Coal of the Swansea district (equivalent of the Llantwit No.3 Seam in the Pontypridd district and the Mynyddislwyn Seam east of the Taff valley), where it overlies mudstone seatearth at the top of the predominantly arenaceous Swansea Member in the Swansea district and the similar Hughes Member in the east of the coalfield. It is a conformable boundary in the west, but is assumed to be an unconformable one in the east (Woodland et al., 1957; Squirrell and Downing, 1969; Barclay, 1989). Also taken at the base of the laterally correlatable Rudge Coal in the Radstack part of the Somerset Coalfield, the High Coal of the Bristol Coalfield and the Avonmouth No.1 Coal of the Severn Coal Basin. Description of the upper boundary is The Grovesend Formation is the youngest unit found in the South Wales and Forest of Dean coalfields. It is overlain unconformably by sandstones of the Sherwood Sandstone Group in the Newent Coalfield, by mudstones of the Mercia Mudstone Group in the Oxfordshire Coalfield and either the Sherwood Sandstone or Mercia Mudstone groups in the Bristol/Somerset Coalfields.

====Swansea Member Formation====

Small outcrop of this formation occurs to East of a fault which has a north–south orientation which is in the penllergaer region of Gorseinon. Lithological characteristics are green-grey, lithic arenites (&quot;Pennant sandstones&quot;) with thin mudstone/siltstone and seatearth interbeds, and mainly thin coals. Description of the lower boundary of this formation is that the base is placed at the base of the Golden Seam (Swansea Three Feet or Graigola) (Woodland et al., 1957), where the coal rests on mudstone seatearth within a predominantly arenaceous sequence of the Pennant Sandstone Formation. Description of the upper boundary of this formation is that the top is placed at the base of the Wernffraith Seam (correlated with the Mynyddislwyn Seam of the eastern part of the South Wales Coalfield) where the coal overlies mudstone seatearth with a predominantly arenaceous sequence of the Pennant Sandstone Formation, and is overlain conformably by the mudstone-dominated succession of the Grovesend Formation.

===Drift Geology===
The most common drift deposit in Gorseinon are Devension till (boulder clay) glacial deposits. The Afon Lliw is dominated by Alluvium deposits. Tidal flat deposits occur East of Gorseinon near the estuary.

===Economic Geology===
Several coal mines and shafts occur in South Gorseinon. There are also abundant aggregate quarries in North Gorseinon. Coal seams occur in the Southern and Eastern limits of Gorseinon.

===Structural Geology===
A large axial plan of an Anticline occurs South of the hospital in Gorseinon with a North West-South East orientation. Four major faults with a north–south orientation in the Gorseinon region.

<doc id="663580" wikidata="Q1541210" url="?curid=663580" title="Gradient-index optics">
<text>Gradient-index (GRIN) optics is the branch of optics covering optical effects produced by a gradient of the refractive index of a material. Such gradual variation can be used to produce lenses with flat surfaces, or lenses that do not have the aberrations typical of traditional spherical lenses. Gradient-index lenses may have a refraction gradient that is spherical, axial, or radial.

== In nature ==
The lens of the eye is the most obvious example of gradient-index optics in nature. In the human eye, the refractive index of the lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens. This allows the eye to image with good resolution and low aberration at both short and long distances.

Another example of gradient index optics in nature is the common mirage of a pool of water appearing on a road on a hot day. The pool is actually an image of the sky, apparently located on the road since light rays are being refracted (bent) from their normal straight path. This is due to the variation of refractive index between the hot, less dense air at the surface of the road, and the denser cool air above it. The variation in temperature (and thus density) of the air causes a gradient in its refractive index, causing it to increase with height. This index gradient causes refraction of light rays (at a shallow angle to the road) from the sky, bending them into the eye of the viewer, with their apparent location being the road&#x27;s surface.

The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere acts as a GRIN lens, allowing observers to see the sun for a few minutes after it is actually below the horizon, and observers can also view stars that are below the horizon. This effect also allows for observation of electromagnetic signals from satellites after they have descended below the horizon, as in radio occultation measurements.

== Applications ==
The ability of GRIN lenses to have flat surfaces simplifies the mounting of the lens, which makes them useful where many very small lenses need to be mounted together, such as in photocopiers and scanners. The flat surface also allows a GRIN lens to be easily optically aligned to a fiber, to produce collimated output, making it applicable for endoscopy as well as for &quot;in vivo&quot; calcium imaging and optogenetic stimulation in brain.

In imaging applications, GRIN lenses are mainly used to reduce aberrations. The design of such lenses involves detailed calculations of aberrations as well as efficient manufacture of the lenses. A number of different materials have been used for GRIN lenses including optical glasses, plastics, germanium, zinc selenide, and sodium chloride.

Certain optical fibres (graded-index fibres) are made with a radially-varying refractive index profile; this design strongly reduces the modal dispersion of a multi-mode optical fiber. The radial variation in refractive index allows for a sinusoidal height distribution of rays within the fibre, preventing the rays from leaving the core. This differs from traditional optical fibres, which rely on total internal reflection, in that all modes of the GRIN fibres propagate at the same speed, allowing for a higher temporal bandwidth for the fibre.

Antireflection coatings are typically effective for narrow ranges of frequency or angle of incidence. Graded-index materials are less constrained.

An axial gradient lens has been used to concentrate sunlight onto solar cells, capturing as much as 90% of incident light when the sun is not at an optimal angle.

== Manufacture ==
GRIN lenses are made by several techniques:
* Neutron irradiation – Boron-rich glass is bombarded with neutrons to cause a change in the boron concentration, and thus the refractive index of the lens.
* Chemical vapour deposition – Involving the deposition of different glass with varying refractive indexes, onto a surface to produce a cumulative refractive change.
* Partial polymerisation – An organic monomer is partially polymerized using ultraviolet light at varying intensities to give a refractive gradient.
* Ion exchange – Glass is immersed into a liquid melt with lithium ions. As a result of diffusion, sodium ions in the glass are partially exchanged with lithium ones, with a larger amount of exchange occurring at the edge. Thus the sample obtains a gradient material structure and a corresponding gradient of the refractive index.
* Ion stuffing – Phase separation of a specific glass causes pores to form, which can later be filled using a variety of salts or concentration of salts to give a varying gradient.
* Direct laser writing – While point-by-point exposing the pre-designed structure an exposure dose is varied (scanning speed, laser power, etc.). This corresponds to spatially tunable monomer-to-polymer degree-of-conversion resulting to a different refractive index. The method is applicable to free-form micro-optical elements and multi-component optics.

== History ==
In 1854, J C Maxwell suggested a lens whose refractive index distribution would allow for every region of space to be sharply imaged. Known as the &quot;Maxwell fisheye lens&quot;, it involves a spherical index function and would be expected to be spherical in shape as well. This lens, however, is impractical to make and has little usefulness since only points on the surface and within the lens are sharply imaged and extended objects suffer from extreme aberrations. In 1905, R. W. Wood used a dipping technique creating a gelatin cylinder with a refractive index gradient that varied symmetrically with the radial distance from the axis. Disk-shaped slices of the cylinder were later shown to have plane faces with radial index distribution. He showed that even though the faces of the lens were flat, they acted like converging and diverging lens depending on whether the index was a decreasing or increasing relative to the radial distance. In 1964, a posthumous book of R. K. Luneburg was published in which he described a lens that focuses incident parallel rays of light onto a point on the opposite surface of the lens. This also limited the applications of the lens because it was difficult to use it to focus visible light; however, it had some usefulness in microwave applications. Some years later several new techniques have been developed to fabricate lenses of the Wood type. Since then at least the thinner GRIN lenses can possess surprisingly good imaging properties considering their very simple mechanical construction, while thicker GRIN lenses found application e.g. in Selfoc rods.

== Theory ==
An inhomogeneous gradient-index lens possesses a refractive index whose change follows the function 
formula_1 of the coordinates of the region of interest in the medium. According to Fermat&#x27;s principle, the light path integral (&quot;L&quot;), taken along a ray of light joining any two points of a medium, is stationary relative to its value for any nearby curve joining the two points. The light path integral is given by the equation
:formula_2, where &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index and &quot;S&quot; is the arc length of the curve. If Cartesian coordinates are used, this equation is modified to incorporate the change in arc length for a spherical gradient, to each physical dimension:
:formula_3
where prime corresponds to d/d&quot;s.&quot; The light path integral is able to characterize the path of light through the lens in a qualitative manner, such that the lens may be easily reproduced in the future.

The refractive index gradient of GRIN lenses can be mathematically modelled according to the method of production used. For example, GRIN lenses made from a radial gradient index material, such as SELFOC Microlens, have a refractive index that varies according to:
:formula_4, where &quot;n&quot;&quot;r&quot; is the refractive index at a distance, &quot;r&quot;, from the optical axis; &quot;n&quot;o is the design index on the optical axis, and &quot;A&quot; is a positive constant.

<doc id="663585" wikidata="Q5602616" url="?curid=663585" title="Green Grow the Rushes, O">
<text>&quot;Green Grow the Rushes, O&quot; (alternatively &quot;Ho&quot; or &quot;Oh&quot;) (also known as &quot;The Twelve Prophets&quot;, &quot;The Carol of the Twelve Numbers&quot;, &quot;The Teaching Song&quot;, &quot;The Dilly Song&quot;, or &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;), is an English folk song (Roud #133). It is sometimes sung as a Christmas carol. It often takes the form of antiphon, where one voice calls and is answered by a chorus.

The song is not to be confused with Robert Burns&#x27;s similarly titled &quot;&quot; nor with the Irish folk band Altan&#x27;s song of the same name. 

It is cumulative in structure, with each verse built up from the previous one by appending a new stanza. The first verse is:

:I&#x27;ll sing you one, O
:Green grow the rushes, O
:What is your one, O?
:One is one and all alone
:And evermore shall be so.

There are many variants of the song, collected by musicologists including Sabine Baring-Gould and Cecil Sharp from the West of England at the start of the twentieth century. The stanzas are clearly much corrupted and often obscure, but the references are generally agreed to be both Biblical and astronomical.

==Lyrics==
The twelfth, cumulated, verse runs:

:I&#x27;ll sing you twelve, O
:Green grow the rushes, O
:What are your twelve, O?
:Twelve for the twelve Apostles
:Eleven for the eleven who went to heaven,
:Ten for the ten commandments,
:Nine for the nine bright shiners,
:Eight for the April Rainers.
:Seven for the seven stars in the sky,
:Six for the six proud walkers,
:Five for the symbols at your door,
:Four for the Gospel makers,
:Three, three, the rivals,
:Two, two, the lily-white boys,
:Clothed all in green, O
:One is one and all alone
:And evermore shall be so.

==Origins==
The lyrics of the song are, in many places, exceedingly obscure, and present an unusual mixture of Christian catechesis, astronomical mnemonics, and what may be pagan cosmology. The musicologist Cecil Sharp, influential in the folklore revival in England, noted in his 1916 &quot;One Hundred English Folksongs&quot; that the words are &quot;so corrupt, indeed, that in some cases we can do little more than guess at their original meaning&quot;.

The song&#x27;s origins and age are uncertain: however, a counting song with similar lyrics, but without the &#x27;Green grow the rushes&#x27; chorus, was sung by English children in the first half of the 19th century.
By 1868 several variant and somewhat garbled versions were being sung by street children as Christmas carols. Sharp states that the song was very common in Somerset and the whole of the West of England.

&quot;Green grow the rushes, Ho&quot; (or &quot;O&quot;), the chorus, is not included in Sharp&#x27;s version, which has simply the call and refrain &quot;Come and I will sing to you. What will you sing to me? I will sing you one-er-y. What is your one-er-y? One is One ...&quot; However, Sharp records that &quot;a form of this song, &#x27;Green grow the rushes, O&#x27; is known at Eton&quot;, that it was printed in &quot;English County Songs&quot;, and that Arthur Sullivan had included a version in the Savoy opera &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;. Sharp discusses at length the similar Hebrew song &quot;Echad Mi Yodea&quot; (Who Knows One?), which accumulates up to thirteen and is sung at many Jewish Passover seders.

==Interpretation==
The twelve stanzas may be interpreted as follows:

:&quot;Twelve for the twelve Apostles&quot;
This refers to the twelve Apostles of Jesus. Sharp states that there were no variants of this line.

:&quot;Eleven for the eleven who went to heaven&quot;
These are the eleven Apostles who remained faithful (minus Judas Iscariot), or possibly St Ursula and her 11,000 companions.

:&quot;Ten for the ten commandments&quot;
This refers to the Ten Commandments given to Moses.

:&quot;Nine for the nine bright shiners&quot;
The nine may be an astronomical reference: the Sun, Moon and five planets known before 1781 yields seven and to this may be added the sphere of the fixed stars and the Empyrean, or it may refer to the nine orders of angels. Sharp records no variants in Somerset, but that Sabine Baring-Gould found a Devon variant &quot;The nine delights&quot; which Sharp glosses as &quot;the joys of Mary&quot;.

:&quot;Eight for the April Rainers&quot;
Refers to the Hyades star cluster, called the &quot;rainy Hyades&quot; in classical times, and rising with the sun in April; the Greeks thought of the Hyades as inaugurating the April rains.

:&quot;Seven for the seven stars in the sky&quot;
The seven are probably the Seven Sisters, the Pleiades star cluster. Other options include Ursa Major, or the seven traditional planets. Alternatively, they could be the seven stars of Revelation chapter 1, verse 16, which are held in the right hand of Christ and explained as referring to the seven angels of seven of the early Christian churches. 

:&quot;Six for the six proud walkers&quot;
This may be a corruption of &#x27;six proud waters&#x27;, a reference to the six jars of water that Jesus turned into wine at the wedding feast at Cana of Galilee, (John 2:6) which Sharp notes was suggested by the editors of &quot;English County Songs&quot;. Or it may refer to Ezekiel 9:2 where six men with swords come in a vision of the prophet to slaughter the people, whose leaders (8:16) have committed such sins as turning East to worship the Sun, and &quot;have filled the land with violence&quot;.

:&quot;Five for the symbols at your door&quot;
May refer to the marks of blood that God commanded the Israelites to put upon their doorways at the Exodus (cf Exodus 12:7). It may also allude to the practice of putting a pentagram at the door of a house to ward off witches and evil spirits in the late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period, and is alluded to in literary works. John Timpson&#x27;s book &quot;Timpson&#x27;s England&quot; states that it refers to five symbols displayed above the doorways of houses that would shelter Catholic priests. He gives an example of a house where these can still be seen.

:&quot;Four for the Gospel makers&quot;
This refers to the four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.

:&quot;Three, three, the rivals&quot;
&#x27;Rivals&#x27; may be a corruption of &quot;Riders&quot;, &quot;Arrivals&quot;, or &quot;Wisers&quot;, referring to the three Magi of the Nativity. The suggestion of the Trinity leaves &quot;the rivals&quot; unexplained. Perhaps it is not intended to mean &#x27;three competitors&#x27; but rather, the 4th century rival philosophical controversies about the trinitarianism: The nature of God as three entities? The rivalry was about which wording could be accepted by a majority, and so would become established as part of the orthodox Christian creed. Another possibility is the trio of Peter, James, and John, often mentioned together in the Gospels, who had a dispute &quot;among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest&quot; (Luke 22:24). Pastor Paul Kolch of Trinity Lutheran Church in Sacramento taught that the three referred to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who resisted burning in the fiery furnace and were &quot;rivals&quot; to the Babylonians. This phrase was thus changed to be &quot;Three, three, alive o&quot;. Another option is Yr Eifl, a group of three similar and adjacent mountains in Wales called &quot;The Rivals&quot; in English. A classical option is Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, the three goddesses between whom the Judgement of Paris was made.

:&quot;Two, two, the lily-white boys&quot;
:&quot;Clothed all in green, Ho&quot;

Many traditions hold that John the Baptist, like Jesus, was born without original sin, making them &quot;the lily-white boys&quot;. &quot;The infant [John the Baptist] leaped in her [Elizabeth&#x27;s] womb&quot; (Luke 1:41).

This may refer to the story of the Transfiguration of Jesus where Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus in clothes of &#x27;dazzling white&#x27;. The &quot;dressed in green&quot; would then refer to St. Peter&#x27;s suggestion that the disciples build shelters of branches for Moses, Elijah, and Jesus. Robert Graves suggested that the reference is the defeat at Yule of Holly King by the Oak King.

Sharp cites Baring-Gould&#x27;s suggestion of an astronomical mnemonic, the Gemini twins (Castor and Pollux) or &quot;signs for Spring&quot;. In support of this, Gemini is the northernmost constellation in the zodiac, therefore high in the winter sky in the northern hemisphere where the aurora borealis on occasion clothes the heavenly twins in green.

Another explanation is that the statues of St. John and St. Mary which, in traditionally configured Anglican and Roman Catholic churches, flank the crucifix on the altar reredos or the rood screen were bound with rushes to cover them, during Holy Week. The two figures were portrayed in similar garments, hence &quot;lily-white&quot; [boys], and wrapped in rushes they were &quot;clothed all in green&quot;. Except that they weren&#x27;t boys.

There is an alternate version:
:: &quot;Two, two, the lily white pair, clothen all in green, Ho&quot;
which may refer to Adam and Eve.

W.W. Reade implied that the stanza refers to ovates, who performed sacrifices for the druids. Normally they would be dressed in white, but their sacerdotal robes would be green. According to the writer and folklorist Tom Slemen, such practices were still being performed in secret in the last century, by a cult known as &quot;The Lily White Boys&quot; in the North West of England.

:&quot;One is one and all alone&quot;
This appears to refer to God.

==Variants==
Apart from the Notes and Queries and the Hebrew versions already mentioned, the following variants are known.

===The Twelve Apostles===
A variant, sung in the American Ozarks, is entitled &quot;The Twelve Apostles&quot;. Its twelfth, cumulated, verse, is:

:Come an&#x27; I will sing!
:What will you sing?
:I will sing of twelve.
:What of the twelve?
:Twelve of the twelve apostles,
:Leven of the saints that has gone to Heaven,
:Ten of the ten commandments,
:Nine of the sunshines bright an&#x27; fair,
:Eight of the eight archangels,
:Seven of the seven stars in the sky,
:Six of the cheerful waiters,
:Five of the ferrymen in the boat,
:Four of the gospel preachers,
:Three of them were strangers,
:Two of the little white babes
:Dressed in the mournin&#x27; green.

===The Dilly Song===
A similar variant is found in Winston Graham&#x27;s &quot;The Twisted Sword&quot; (1990), the penultimate book in the Poldark series. It is sung by a Cornish choir on Christmas Eve. Current 93 recorded a version on their 1988 album &quot;Earth Covers Earth&quot;. English folksinger Kate Rusby recorded a rendition of &quot;The Dilly Carol&quot; for her 2015 Christmas album &quot;The Frost is All Over&quot;:

:Come and I will sing you
:What will you sing O?
:I will sing One O.
:What is your One O?

:Twelve are the Twelve Apostles
:Leven are the &#x27;leven will go to Heaven
:Ten are the Ten Commandments
:Nine is the moonshine bright and clear
:Eight are the Eight Archangels
:Seven are the Seven Stars in the sky
:Six the Cheerful Waiter
:Five is the Ferryman in the boat
:Four are the Gospel Praychers
:Three of them are strangers
:Two of them are Lilly-white babes
:Clothed all in green-o
:One of them is all alone and ever shall remain so.

<text>The Earl&#x27;s Palace in Birsay, Orkney, Scotland, is a ruined 16th-century castle. It was built by Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney (1533–1593), illegitimate son of King James V and his mistress Euphemia Elphinstone. The palace is in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==History==
Adam Bothwell, Bishop of Orkney, had a house at Birsay, which he called the &quot;place of Birsay&quot;. In December 1560, it was taken and occupied by Henry Sinclair of Strom, an Orkney landowner and a son of Edward Sinclair, the Sheriff of Orkney.

The castle was constructed in two phases. The first phase of work, begun in the 1570s, consisted of the great hall located in the south range, above the main door. Beside this was Lord Orkney&#x27;s private chamber in the south-east corner tower. An inscription above the entrance, dated 1574, marks this phase. The second phase, completed in the 1580s, saw a new range containing a great hall and chamber built on the north side of the courtyard. The second phase probably followed Robert&#x27;s acquisition of the Earldom of Orkney in 1581. After the death of Robert Stewart, the palace was used only occasionally by later earls of Orkney, and was not occupied after the mid-17th century. By 1701 the palace had begun to deteriorate badly.

==The castle==

The two-storey palace was constructed around a central courtyard and well, with large stone towers at three of the four corners. It was as much a fortress as a residence. Only the palace&#x27;s upper floors had large windows; the accessible ground floors were equipped with small openings and an array of gun-holes, from which musketeers could cover every side of the building.

Few records of the palace remain to give a clear impression of its contents and layout. The Reverend John Brand published a book about Orkney in 1701, and included a description of the palace. He wrote:

<doc id="663590" wikidata="Q415756" url="?curid=663590" title="Bromelain">
<text>Bromelain is an enzyme extract derived from the stems of pineapples, although it exists in all parts of the fresh plant and fruit. The extract has a history of folk medicine use. As a culinary ingredient, it may be used as a meat tenderizer.

The term &quot;bromelain&quot; may refer to either of two protease enzymes extracted from the plants of the family Bromeliaceae, or it may refer to a combination of those enzymes along with other compounds produced in an extract.

Although tested in a variety of folk medicine and research models for its possible efficacy against diseases, the only approved clinical application for bromelain was issued in 2012 by the European Medicines Agency for a topical medication called &quot;NexoBrid&quot; used to remove dead tissue in severe skin burns. There is no other established application for bromelain as a nutraceutical or drug.

==Extract components==
Bromelain extract is a mixture of protein-digesting (proteolytic) enzymes and several other substances in smaller quantities. The proteolytic enzymes are sulfhydryl proteases; a free sulfhydryl group of a cysteine amino acid side chain is required for function. The two main enzymes are:

* Stem bromelain – 
* Fruit bromelain – 

==History==
Pineapples have a long tradition as a medicinal plant among the natives of South and Central America. The first isolation of bromelain was recorded by the Venezuelan chemist Vicente Marcano in 1891 by fermenting the fruit of pineapple. In 1892, Russell Henry Chittenden, assisted by Elliott P. Joslin and Frank Sherman Meara, investigated the matter more completely, and called it &#x27;bromelin&#x27;. Later, the term &#x27;bromelain&#x27; was introduced and originally applied to any protease from any member of the plant family Bromeliaceae.

==Sources==
Bromelain is present in all parts of the pineapple plant (&quot;Ananas&quot; sp.), but the stem is the most common commercial source, presumably because usable quantities are readily extractable after the fruit has been harvested.

==Production==
Produced mainly in parts of the world where pineapples are grown, such as Thailand or Malaysia, bromelain is extracted from the peel, stem, leaves or waste of the pineapple plant after processing the fruit for juice or other purposes. The starting material is blended and pressed through a filter to obtain a supernatant liquid containing the soluble bromelain enzyme. Further processing includes purification and concentration of the enzyme.
==Temperature stability==
After an hour at 50 °C (122 °F), 83% of the enzyme remains, while at 40 °C (104 °F), practically 100% remains. The proteolytic activity of concentrated bromelain solutions remains relatively stable for at least 1 week at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaw cycles or exposure to the digestive enzyme trypsin have little effect on it.

==Uses==

===Meat tenderizing and other uses===
Along with papain, bromelain is one of the most popular proteases to use for meat tenderizing. Bromelain is sold in a powdered form, which is combined with a marinade, or directly sprinkled on the uncooked meat.

Cooked or canned pineapple does not have a tenderizing effect, as the enzymes are heat-labile and denatured in the cooking process. Some prepared meat products, such as meatballs and commercially available marinades, include pineapple and/or pineapple-derived ingredients.

Although the quantity of bromelain in a typical serving of pineapple fruit is probably not significant, specific extraction can yield sufficient quantities for domestic and industrial processing, including uses in baking, anti-browning of cut fruit, textiles and cosmetics manufacturing.

===Potential medical uses===
A concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain is approved in Europe for the debridement (removal of dead tissue) of severe burn wounds under the trade name &quot;NexoBrid&quot;.

Bromelain has not been scientifically proven to be effective in treating any other diseases and it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of any disorder. In the United States, the passage of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA, 1994) allows the sale of bromelain-containing dietary supplements even though efficacy has not been confirmed.

While there have been studies which positively correlated the use of bromelain with reduction of symptom severity in osteoarthritis, &quot;[t]he majority of the studies have methodological issues that make it difficult to draw definite conclusions&quot;, as none definitively established efficacy, recommended dosage, long term safety, or adverse interaction with other medications.

Systemic enzyme therapy (consisting of combinations of proteolytic enzymes such as bromelain, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and papain) has been investigated in Europe to evaluate the efficacy in breast, colorectal, and plasmacytoma cancer patients.

Bromelain may be effective as an adjunct therapy in relieving symptoms of acute rhinosinusitis in patients not treated with antibiotics.

Bromelain is also claimed as a tooth plaque removal enhancer in toothpastes.

<doc id="663591" wikidata="Q316246" url="?curid=663591" title="Phil Jackson">
<text>Philip Douglas Jackson (born September 17, 1945) is an American former professional basketball player, coach, and executive. A power forward, Jackson played 12 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning championships with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973. Regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time, Jackson was the head coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989 to 1998, leading them to six NBA championships. He then coached the Los Angeles Lakers from 1999 to 2004 and again from 2005 to 2011; the team won five league titles under his leadership. Jackson&#x27;s 11 NBA titles as a coach surpassed the previous record of nine set by Red Auerbach. He holds numerous other records as a coach, including the most postseason wins (229), and most conference titles (13).

Jackson is known for his use of Tex Winter&#x27;s triangle offense as well as a holistic approach to coaching that was influenced by Eastern philosophy, garnering him the nickname &quot;Zen Master&quot;. Jackson cited Robert Pirsig&#x27;s book &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; as one of the major guiding forces in his life. He also applied Native American spiritual practices as documented in his book &quot;Sacred Hoops&quot;. He is the author of several candid books about his teams and his basketball strategies. In 2007, Jackson was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1996, as part of celebrations for the NBA&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Jackson was named one of the 10 greatest coaches in league history.

Jackson retired from coaching in 2011 and joined the Knicks as an executive in March 2014. He was dismissed as the Knicks&#x27; team president in 2017.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Deer Lodge, Montana, on September 17, 1945. His parents, Charles and Elisabeth Funk Jackson, were Assemblies of God ministers. Elisabeth came from a long line of German Mennonites before her conversion to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father, Charles, generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor. Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, and went to a dance for the first time in college. Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.

Jackson attended high school in Williston, North Dakota, where he played varsity basketball and led the team to a state title. He also played football, was a pitcher on the baseball team, and threw the discus in track and field competitions. The high school now has a sports complex named after him. His brother Chuck speculated years later that the three Jackson sons threw themselves passionately into athletics because it was the only time they were allowed to do what other children were doing. Jackson attracted the attention of several baseball scouts. Their notes found their way to future NBA coach Bill Fitch, who had previously coached baseball, and had been doing some scouting for the Milwaukee Braves. Fitch took over as head basketball coach at the University of North Dakota in the spring of 1962, during Jackson&#x27;s junior year of high school.

==College career==
Bill Fitch successfully recruited Jackson to the University of North Dakota, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Jackson did well there, helping the Fighting Sioux to third- and fourth-place finishes in the NCAA Division II tournament in his sophomore and junior years (1965 and 1966). Both years, they were beaten by the Southern Illinois Salukis. Jackson&#x27;s future Knicks teammate Walt Frazier was the Salukis&#x27; biggest star, but the two only faced off in 1965, as Frazier was academically ineligible in 1966.

==Professional career==
===New York Knicks (1967–1978)===

In 1967, Jackson was drafted in the second round by the New York Knicks. While he was a good all-around athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively but compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense. Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA&#x27;s leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in 1973. Jackson did not play during New York&#x27;s 1969–70 championship season due to spinal fusion surgery; however, he authored a book entitled &quot;Take It All&quot;, a photo diary of the Knicks&#x27; 1970 championship run.

Soon after the 1973 title, several key starters retired, creating an opening for Jackson in the starting lineup. In the 1974–75 NBA season, Jackson and the Milwaukee Bucks&#x27; Bob Dandridge shared the lead for total personal fouls, with 330 each. Jackson lived in Leonia, New Jersey, during this time.

===New Jersey Nets (1978–1980)===
After crossing the Hudson in 1978 to play two seasons for the New Jersey Nets, Jackson retired as a player after the 1979–80 NBA season.

==Coaching career==
===CBA and Puerto Rico (1982–1987)===
In the years immediately following the end of his playing career, Jackson coached in professional leagues like the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) and Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;National Superior Basketball&quot; (BSN). While in the CBA, he won his first coaching championship, leading the Albany Patroons to their first title in 1984. Jackson was named the CBA Coach of the Year in 1985. In Puerto Rico, he coached the Piratas de Quebradillas (1984 and 1987) and the Gallitos de Isabela (1984–1986). He regularly sought NBA jobs, but was turned down. Jackson had acquired a reputation for being sympathetic to the counterculture during his playing years, which may have scared off potential NBA employers.

===Chicago Bulls (1987–1998)===
In 1987, Jackson was hired as an assistant coach by the Chicago Bulls under Doug Collins. He was promoted to head coach after Collins was fired in 1989. It was around this time that he met Tex Winter and became a devotee of Winter&#x27;s triangle offense. Over nine seasons, Jackson coached the Bulls to six championships, winning three straight championships over separate three-year periods. The &quot;three-peat&quot; was the first since the Boston Celtics won eight titles in a row from 1959 through 1966.
Jackson and the Bulls made the playoffs every year, and failed to win the title only three times. Michael Jordan&#x27;s first retirement after the 1992–1993 season marked the end of the first &quot;three-peat&quot;, and although Jordan returned just before the 1995 playoffs, it was not enough to prevent a playoff elimination by the Orlando Magic.

Despite the Bulls&#x27; success, tension between Jackson and Bulls general manager Jerry Krause grew. Some believed that Krause felt under-recognized for building a championship team and believed that Jackson was indebted to him for giving him his first NBA coaching job. In the summer of 1997, Jackson was not invited to the wedding of Krause&#x27;s stepdaughter, although all of the Bulls&#x27; assistant coaches were, as was Tim Floyd, then head coach at Iowa State, Jackson&#x27;s eventual successor. After contentious negotiations, Jackson was signed for the 1997–98 season only. Krause publicly portrayed Jackson as a two-faced character who had very little regard for his assistant coaches.

After the Bulls&#x27; final title of the Jordan era in 1998, Jackson left the team vowing never to coach again. However, after taking a year off, he decided to give it another chance with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1999–2004, 2005–2011)===
Jackson took over a talented Lakers team and immediately produced results as he had done in Chicago. In his first year in Los Angeles, the Lakers went 67–15 during the regular season to top the league. Reaching the conference finals, they eliminated the Portland Trail Blazers in a tough seven-game series and then won the 2000 NBA championship by beating the Indiana Pacers.

With the talented superstar duo of Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant, the strong supporting cast of Glen Rice, Derek Fisher, Rick Fox, Devean George, A.C. Green, Robert Horry, and Brian Shaw, and the assistance of former Bulls Horace Grant, Ron Harper, and John Salley, Jackson led the Lakers to two additional titles in 2001 and 2002, against the Philadelphia 76ers and New Jersey Nets, adding up to his third three-peat as head coach. The main serious challenge the Lakers faced was from their conference rival, the Sacramento Kings.
However, injuries, weak bench play, and public tension between Bryant and O&#x27;Neal slowed the team down, and they were beaten in the second round of the 2003 NBA Playoffs by the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs.
Afterward, Jackson clashed frequently with Bryant. While remarkably efficient in Jackson&#x27;s &quot;triangle offense&quot;, Bryant had a personal distaste for Jackson&#x27;s brand of basketball and subsequently called it &quot;boring&quot;. In games, Bryant would often disregard the set offense completely to experiment with his own one-on-one moves, infuriating the normally calm Jackson. Bryant managed to test Jackson&#x27;s patience enough that the &quot;Zen Master&quot; even demanded that Bryant be traded, although Lakers management rejected the request.

Prior to the 2003–04 season, the Lakers signed NBA star veterans Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who had been franchise players for the Utah Jazz and the Seattle SuperSonics, respectively, leading to predictions by some that the team would finish with the best record in NBA history. But from the first day of training camp, the Lakers were beset by distractions. Bryant&#x27;s trial for sexual assault, continued public sniping between O&#x27;Neal and Bryant, and repeated disputes between Jackson and Bryant all affected the team during the season. Despite these distractions, the Lakers beat the defending champion Spurs en route to advancing to the 2004 NBA Finals and were heavy favorites to regain the title. However, they were upset by the Detroit Pistons, who used their strong defense to dominate the Lakers, winning the title four games to one. This marked the first time in ten attempts as head coach that Jackson had lost in the NBA Finals.

On June 18, 2004, three days after the loss to the Pistons, the Lakers announced that Jackson would leave his position as Lakers coach. Jackson was seeking to double his salary from $6 million to $12 million on his expiring contract. He had a contract offer outstanding from the Lakers, but he had not acted on it. Winter said Jackson announced at the All-Star break that he would not want to return to the Lakers if Bryant returned. Many fans attributed Jackson&#x27;s departure directly to the wishes of Bryant, as Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss reportedly sided with Bryant. Jackson, Bryant, and Buss all denied that Bryant had made any explicit demand regarding Jackson. However, O&#x27;Neal, upon hearing General Manager Mitch Kupchak&#x27;s announcement of the team&#x27;s willingness to trade O&#x27;Neal and its intention to keep Bryant, indicated that he felt the franchise was indeed pandering to Bryant&#x27;s wishes with the departure of Jackson. O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s trade to the Miami Heat was the end of the &quot;Trifecta&quot; that had led the Lakers to three championship titles.

That fall, Jackson released &quot;The Last Season&quot;, a book that describes his point of view of the tensions that surrounded the 2003–04 Lakers team. The book was pointedly critical of Kobe Bryant.

Without Jackson and O&#x27;Neal, the Lakers were forced to become a faster-paced team on the court. Though they achieved some success in the first half of the season, injuries to several players including Kobe Bryant and Lamar Odom forced the team out of contention, going 34–48 in 2004–05 and missing the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. Rudy Tomjanovich, Jackson&#x27;s successor as coach, resigned midway through the season after coaching just 41 games, citing health issues not related to his past bout with bladder cancer, which immediately led to speculation that the Lakers might bring Jackson back.

On June 15, 2005, preceding the 2005–06 season, the Lakers rehired Jackson. Jackson subsequently led the Lakers to a seventh-seed playoff berth for the 2006 playoffs. Once again promoting the notion of selfless team play embodied by the triangle offense, the team achieved substantial results, especially in the last month of the season. Jackson also worked very seamlessly with Bryant, who had earlier shown his desire to bring back Jackson to the bench. Bryant&#x27;s regular-season performance won him the league scoring title and made him a finalist in MVP voting. However, the Lakers faced a tough 2006 first-round matchup against the second-seeded Phoenix Suns, who were led by eventual MVP winner Steve Nash. The Lakers jumped out to a 3–1 lead following a dramatic last-second shot by Bryant in overtime to win game four, but the Suns recovered to win the last three and take the series. It was the first time that a Jackson-coached team had failed to reach the second round of the playoffs.
On January 7, 2007, Jackson won his 900th game, then placing him 9th on the all-time win list for NBA coaches. With this win, Jackson became the fastest to reach 900 career wins, doing so in only 1,264 games and beating Pat Riley&#x27;s previous record of 900 in 1,278 games.

On December 12, 2007, after announcing he would return to his position as coach just a few days prior, Jackson inked a 2-year contract extension to continue his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers through the end of the 2009–2010 season.

During the 2007–08 season, the Lakers were able to obtain Pau Gasol in a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies. With another star to pair with Bryant, Jackson coached the Lakers to an appearance in the 2008 NBA Finals against the Boston Celtics. Boston went on to win the series 4–2, in the process handing Jackson and the Lakers their worst playoff loss ever in Game 6, a 39-point defeat. It was only the second time in 11 appearances that Jackson had lost an NBA Finals.

On December 25, 2008, Jackson became the sixth coach to win 1,000 games, with the Lakers defeating the Celtics in their first matchup since the last year&#x27;s finals. He was the fastest to win 1,000 games, surpassing Pat Riley, who had taken 11 more games than Jackson.

Jackson again coached the Lakers to the NBA Finals in 2009, defeating the Utah Jazz, Houston Rockets, and Denver Nuggets in the process. In the Finals, the Lakers defeated the Orlando Magic 4–1, clinching Jackson&#x27;s 10th NBA championship as head coach and surpassing the record for most championships won by a head coach previously held by him and Red Auerbach.

On February 3, 2010, Jackson recorded his 534th win as Lakers head coach, surpassing Pat Riley to become the most successful coach in franchise history. The Lakers would go on to a fifth consecutive playoff berth in 2010. They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz, and Phoenix Suns in the playoffs before defeating the Boston Celtics in the 2010 NBA Finals, earning Jackson his 11th NBA championship as head coach and his fifth with the Lakers.

On July 1, 2010, Jackson, after giving it tremendous thought and consulting with his doctors over health concerns, announced that he would return to coach the Lakers for the 2010–11 season. On August 2, 2010, Jackson signed a new contract with the Lakers to return for what he mentioned was &quot;his last stand&quot;, meaning the 2010–11 season would be his last. In January 2011, he reiterated that it would be his final season, explaining that in the past there was the possibility that maybe he would reconsider. &quot;This year, there&#x27;s no maybe&quot;, said Jackson. He retired after the Lakers were swept out of the playoffs in the conference semifinals by that season&#x27;s eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks, meaning that he would not get a fourth three-peat (after previously achieving that feat in 1993, 1998 and 2002). In his final news conference that season, he noted that he did not have much of a relationship with Jerry or Jim Buss, and said, &quot;When I leave here, I don&#x27;t anticipate Lakers management will call me up and ask my advice.&quot;

After the Lakers fired Jackson&#x27;s successor, Mike Brown, early in the 2012–13 season, they first approached Jackson to replace Brown. Jackson requested two days to consider the opening. He believed the Lakers would wait for his response, but the Lakers thought it was understood they would continue their search. The next day, the team talked with Mike D&#x27;Antoni and hired him in a unanimous decision by the front office. They felt D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s fast-paced style of play made him a &quot;great fit&quot; for the team, more suitable than Jackson&#x27;s structured triangle offense. Jerry Buss&#x27; preference has always been for the Lakers to have a wide-open offense. In the two games leading up to D&#x27;Antoni&#x27;s signing, Lakers fans at Staples Center had chanted &quot;We Want Phil!&quot;

==Executive career==
===New York Knicks (2014–2017)===
In 2014, Jackson was in discussions for months with the New York Knicks regarding an executive position with the team. On March 18, he was introduced as the president of the Knicks after signing a five-year, $60 million contract.

On April 21, 2014, over one week after the conclusion of the season, Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired by Jackson. The Knicks finished the season with a 37–45 record and finished 9th in the Eastern Conference standings.

On June 9, 2014, the Knicks hired Derek Fisher as the head coach. Fisher had played under Phil Jackson as a Laker and won five championships together.

On June 25, 2014, the Knicks traded guard Raymond Felton along with former NBA Defensive Player of the Year Tyson Chandler to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the following day&#x27;s draft. The trade was the first one that he executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the 2014 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, after he was traded by the Pacers.

On January 7, 2015, the Knicks set a franchise record with 13 straight losses. The Knicks fell 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise&#x27;s 69-year history. This record was extended to 16 straight losses after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. They ended the season with a franchise-worst record of 17–65.

On June 25, 2015, the Knicks drafted Latvian Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft; he signed his rookie-scale contract with the Knicks on July 30, 2015. On that same night, the Knicks traded Tim Hardaway Jr. for the 19th pick in the draft, which would become Jerian Grant. Porziņģis was an NBA All-Rookie First Team selection for the 2016 season.

On November 14, 2016, Jackson was criticized for using the word &quot;posse&quot; to describe Cleveland Cavaliers small forward LeBron James and his business associates during a situation that occurred during James&#x27; tenure with the Miami Heat, via ESPN.com&#x27;s Jackie MacMullan.

On June 28, 2017, the Knicks officially announced a mutual decision to part ways with Jackson. The speculated reasoning for the parting of ways was Jackson&#x27;s attempted buying-out of Carmelo Anthony and his very public strife with Porziņģis. Jackson was replaced by his former subordinate Steve Mills.

==Awards==
Jackson won the 1996 NBA Coach of the Year Award. In the same year, he was named one of the ten greatest NBA coaches of all time by vote in an unranked compilation. At the time he was in his 8th year coaching; in the seven years prior he coached 574 games and won 414, with only 160 losses, and had a win–loss percentage of 72.1% – the highest of any coach on the list at that time. He continued his success in his later career; cumulative careers in perspective, he retains the highest win–loss percentage of any coach on this list at 70.4% (1155 wins, 485 losses).

In 2002 and 2010 the United States Sports Academy awarded Jackson the Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award.

Jackson is a recipient of the state of North Dakota&#x27;s Roughrider Award.

==Personal life==
Jackson has five children and eight grandchildren. He married his first wife, Maxine, in 1967. They divorced in 1972. He married his second wife, June, in 1974, but they divorced in 2000. He dated Jeanie Buss, the daughter of Lakers owner Jerry Buss, whom he met in 1999. The two became engaged in 2013. On December 27, 2016, they announced the termination of their engagement in a joint statement on Twitter.

While he was the coach of the Chicago Bulls, he lived in Bannockburn, Illinois. He lived in Playa del Rey, Los Angeles when he was the coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. While he was the president of basketball operations of the New York Knicks, he lived in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. He currently resides in Flathead Lake, Montana.

He has 26 hours of graduate study in psychology.

Jackson said he has used marijuana and LSD in the past. In 2010, he said he did not believe that prisons should be filled with people prosecuted for marijuana, but called California&#x27;s Proposition 19, which would have legalized marijuana, poorly written. 

Jackson is a Deadhead, a fan of the Grateful Dead, and attended some of their concerts in the 1970s and 1990s.

In a 1990 interview with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Jackson said that he did not care for preachers who browbeat the audience, describing his religious views thusly: &quot;I&#x27;ve always liked the concept of God being beyond anything that the human mind can conceive. I think there is a pantheistic-deistic-American Indian combination religion out there for Americans. That rings true to me.&quot;

Jackson was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2011. He informed the Lakers players of this in May, when they were involved in a second-round playoff series against the Mavericks. Jackson decided to delay his surgery until after the playoffs.

In 2020, he was a subject of the documentary miniseries &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, alongside Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Steve Kerr and Dennis Rodman.

Jackson no longer watches the NBA, having said in April 2023 that it had become too political. &quot;People want to see sports as non-political,&quot; he said.

===Head coaching record===
Jackson has had a winning record every year as a head coach, and currently has the highest winning percentage of any Hall of Fame coach, and the highest of any NBA coach coaching 500 games or more. Along with his NBA-record 11 championships, he is the only coach to win at least 10 championships in any of North America&#x27;s major professional sports: the records are respectively 6 titles in the NFL, 9 titles in the NHL and 7 titles in MLB.

At the end of the 2010 season he had the fifth-most wins of any NBA coach, and was one of only six to have over 1,000 wins. Of those six he was the only one who had not coached over 1,900 games, and the only one not included in the top 10 total games coached.

<doc id="663592" wikidata="Q5543466" url="?curid=663592" title="Neil Aggett">
<text>Neil Aggett (6 October 1953 – 5 February 1982) was a Kenyan and South African doctor and trade union organiser who was killed, while in detention, by the Security Branch of the Apartheid South African Police Service after being held for 70 days without trial.

== Life and career ==

Aggett was born in Nanyuki, Kenya, and was of British descent. His family eventually moved to South Africa in 1964, where he attended Kingswood College (South Africa) in Grahamstown from 1964 to 1970, and later the University of Cape Town, where he completed a medical degree in 1976.

Aggett worked as a physician in Black hospitals (under apartheid hospitals were segregated) in Umtata, Tembisa and later at Baragwanath hospital in Soweto, working in Casualty and learning to speak in basic Zulu. He was appointed an unpaid organiser of the Transvaal Food and Canning Workers&#x27; Union, and helped to organise the workers at Fatti’s and Moni’s in Isando, at a critical time when the company faced a growing boycott campaign for having unfairly dismissed workers at its factory in Bellville, Western Cape. He worked as a doctor on Wednesday nights and Friday nights so he could continue with his union work.

Following a historic gathering in Langa near Cape Town, in August 1981, of unions that had previously been fiercely divided, he was entrusted with building a Transvaal Solidarity Committee.

== Detention and death ==
Aggett was unjustly detained with his partner Dr Elizabeth Floyd by the Apartheid security police on 27 November 1981. His death on 5 February 1982, after 70 days of detention without trial, marked the 51st death in detention. He was 28 years old. He was the first white person to die in detention since 1963. According to the Apartheid South African Security Police, Aggett allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself while being held at the John Vorster Square police station.

About 15,000 mourners attended Aggett&#x27;s funeral on 13 February 1982, including Bishop Desmond Tutu. Previously divided unions called for a joint stay-away two days before the funeral, to which about 90,000 workers from across the country responded. Aggett is buried in the Westpark Cemetery in Johannesburg. His grave is numbered ECB1613.

=== First inquest ===
The inquest into his death lasted 44 days. The Aggett team of lawyers, led by anti-Apartheid activist and senior legal counsel George Bizos with Denis Kuny as his junior, used &#x27;similar fact&#x27; evidence and argued &#x27;induced suicide&#x27;. For the first time in a South African court of law, former detainees gave evidence of torture. Aggett made an affidavit 14 hours before his death that he had been assaulted, blindfolded and given electric shocks. However, Magistrate Kotze ruled that the death was not brought about by any act or omission on the part of the Apartheid police.

Some five years after his death, at the 1987 conference of the Five Freedoms Forum, fellow detainee Frank Chikane recalled how he had seen Aggett in jail returning from one of his interrogations, being half carried, half dragged by warders; Chikane saw this as a sign of how badly injured Aggett was at the time.

=== Second inquest ===
The High Court in Johannesburg re-opened an inquest into Aggett&#x27;s death on Monday, 20 January 2020, 38 years after his death by alleged suicide. Jill Burger, Aggett&#x27;s sister, told the High Court during the Johannesburg inquest that her brother was killed when the torture went too far.

On 4 March 2022 Judge Motsamai Makume overturned the findings of the 1982 inquest in his ruling in the Johannesburg High Court. After a thorough inquiry based on factual evidence and depositions of former members of the Security Branch and fellow detainees, the court ruled that Dr. Neil Aggett did not die by suicide but was killed by members of the Apartheid Security Branch in the early hours of the morning on 5 February 1982. This sets in motion avenues for the National Prosecuting Authority to prosecute those Security Branch Police officers responsible for his death and the cover up which followed. Judge Makume referred to Judge Kotze&#x27;s findings in the original inquest as &#x27;a serious error in judgment&#x27; and his conclusions as &#x27;mind-blowingly weak&#x27;.

The inquest on 4 March 2022 found that Dr. Aggett didn’t die of hanging but due to Crush Syndrome caused by beatings and forcible exercise at the John Vorster Prison, Johannesburg. The details were published in the Journal of Medicine and Public Health, Chicago IL 60659, USA 
==Honours and legacy==
Johnny Clegg included a tribute to Aggett in his song, &quot;Asimbonanga (Mandela)&quot; on the Third World Child album (1987). Clegg also wrote the song &quot;Siyayilanda&quot; on the Scatterlings album (1982) for Aggett. George Bizos includes a chapter on the Aggett inquest in the book &quot;No One to Blame?: In Pursuit of Justice in South Africa.&quot; Donald McRae reveals how Aggett&#x27;s death in detention deeply affected himself and his family in his memoir &quot;Under Our Skin&quot; &#x27;Death of an Idealist: In Search of Neil Aggett&#x27; is a full referenced biography by Beverley Naidoo, with a Foreword by George Bizos SC.

The South African Medical Association, a non-statutory, professional association for public- and private-sector medical practitioners in South Africa never recognized the tireless deeds for the underprivileged by Dr. Neil Aggett and subsequent torture leading to his death at John Vorster Prison, Johannesburg.

The Neil Aggett Labour Studies Unit (NALSU) at Rhodes University is named in honour of Aggett.

=== Neil Aggett Memorial Lecture ===

The Annual Neil Aggett Memorial Lecture is held at Kingswood College, Grahamstown. Aggett attended Kingswood College from 1964-1970.The lecture focuses on memories of Neil Aggett and looks at the concept of injustice and what injustice is, and how we, as a society, face more injustices than ever before. Dr Amitabh Mitra, was a special guest at the year 2019 lecture as he presented the school with a charcoal drawing that he drew of Neil Aggett. This drawing is one of very few visual representations of Aggett and will be displayed in the Kingswood College Museum.

<doc id="663594" wikidata="Q1190737" url="?curid=663594" title="Sumer is icumen in">
<text>&quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; is the incipit of a medieval English round or of the mid-13th century; it is also known variously as the Summer Canon and the Cuckoo Song.

The line translates approximately to &quot;Summer has come&quot; or &quot;Summer has arrived&quot;. The song is written in the Wessex dialect of Middle English. Although the composer&#x27;s identity is unknown today, it may have been W. de Wycombe or a monk at Reading Abbey, . The manuscript in which it is preserved was copied between 1261 and 1264.

This is the oldest known musical composition featuring six-part polyphony.

It is sometimes called the Reading Rota because the earliest known copy of the composition, a manuscript written in mensural notation, was found at Reading Abbey; it was probably not drafted there, however. The British Library now retains this manuscript. A copy of the manuscript in stone relief is displayed on the wall of the ruined chapter house of Reading Abbey.

==Rota==
A (Latin for &#x27;wheel&#x27;) is a type of round, which in turn is a kind of part song. To perform the round, one singer begins the song, and a second starts singing the beginning again just as the first gets to the point marked with the red cross in the first figure below. The length between the start and the cross corresponds to the modern notion of a bar, and the main verse comprises six phrases spread over twelve such bars. In addition, there are two lines marked &quot;Pes&quot;, two bars each, that are meant to be sung together repeatedly underneath the main verse. These instructions are included (in Latin) in the manuscript itself:
&quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; in modern notation:

==Lyrics==
The celebration of summer in &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; is similar to that of spring in the French poetic genre known as the &quot;reverdie&quot; (lit. &quot;re-greening&quot;). However, there are reasons to doubt such a straightforward and naïve interpretation. The language used lacks all of the conventional springtime-renewal words of a &quot;reverdie&quot; (such as &quot;green&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, &quot;begin&quot;, or &quot;wax&quot;) except for &quot;springþ&quot;, and elements of the text, especially the cuckoo and the farmyard noises, potentially possess double meanings. &quot;It is the wrong bird, the wrong season, and the wrong language for a &quot;reverdie&quot;, unless an ironic meaning is intended&quot;.

===&quot;Bucke Uerteþ&quot;===
The translation of &quot;bucke uerteþ&quot; is uncertain. Some (such as , in the version given above) translate the former word as &quot;buck-goat&quot; and the latter as &quot;passes wind&quot; (with reconstructed OE spelling &quot;feortan&quot;). Platzer, on the other hand, views the latter, more vulgar, gloss as informed by &quot;prejudices against mediæval culture&quot; and suspects that those preferring it &quot;may have had an axe to grind&quot;.

Erickson derided &quot;linguistic Galahads&quot; for promoting more decent translations, suggesting:

Editorial prudishness has kept that fine little Middle English poem, the Cuckoo Song, out of many a school-book, all because the old poet was familiar with English barn-yards and meadows and in his poem recalled those sights and sounds. He knew that bullocks and bucks feel so good in the springtime that they can hardly contain themselves, and he set down what he saw and heard, leaving it to squeamish editors to distort one of his innocent folk-words into a meaning that he would not recognise. One suspects that scholarly ingenuity has been overworked [...] to save the children of England from indecency.
Similarly, Arthur K. Moore states:
The older anthologists sometimes made ludicrous attempts to gloss &#x27;buck uerteth&#x27; in a way tolerable to Victorian sensibilities. Most recent editors have recognized what every farm boy knows—that quadrupeds disport themselves in the spring precisely as the poet has said. To the fourteenth century, the idea was probably inoffensive.
According to Platzer, &quot;this traditional reading is not as secure as the number of editors that have championed it might imply&quot;. The evolution of &quot;verteþ&quot; could not have originated in the unattested Old English &quot;feortan&quot;, in part because there is a gap of between 100 and 120 years between the first unambiguous usage of that word and its postulated use in &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot;. Given that the poem was likely composed in Reading, with Leominster as a second possibility, a quantitative analysis was performed using the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of Late Mediæval English&quot;; out of nine lexemes originally beginning with the letter F, six demonstrably retained that letter in Reading (the other three were unattested), while four retained it in Leominster (four unattested, with &quot;fetch&quot; evolving into &quot;vetch&quot;). The &quot;Middle English Dictionary&quot; records a personal name &quot;Walterus Fartere&quot; from the calendar of the close rolls of 1234, and another name &quot;Johannes le Fartere&quot; from the Leicestershire lay subsidy rolls of 1327. This also implies the existence of a word &quot;farten&quot; or &quot;ferten&quot; in Middle English, both with an initial letter F.

===Christian version in Latin===
Beneath the Middle English lyrics in the manuscript, there is also a set of Latin lyrics which consider the sacrifice of the Crucifixion of Jesus:
†written &quot;&quot; in the manuscript (see Christogram).

==Renditions and recordings==

*A boys&#x27; choir sings the rota at the climax of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Spring Symphony (Opus 44, first performed 1949).
*The opening ceremony of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich included a performance of this rota. Children danced to the music around the track of the stadium.

===Studio albums===
*The English Singers made the first studio recording in New York, c. 1927, released on a 10-inch 78rpm disc, Roycroft Living Tone Record No.159, in early 1928.
*A second recording, made by the Winchester Music Club, followed in 1929. Released on Columbia (England) D40119 (matrix number WAX4245-2), this twelve-inch 78rpm record was made to illustrate the second in a series of five lectures by Sir George Dyson, for the International Educational Society, and is titled &quot;Lecture 61. The Progress Of Music. No. 1 Rota (Canon): Summer Is A Coming In (Part 4)&quot;.)
* For similar purposes, E. H. Fellowes conducted the St. George&#x27;s Singers in a recording issued c. 1930 on Columbia (US) 5715, a ten-inch 78rpm disc, part of the eight-disc album M-221, the &quot;Columbia History of Music by Ear and Eye, Volume One, Period 1: To the Opening of the Seventeenth Century&quot;.
*The London Madrigal Group, conducted by T.B. Lawrence, recorded the work on 10 January 1936. This recording was issued later that year on Victrola 4316 (matrix numbers OEA2911 and OEA2913), a ten-inch 78rpm disc.
*Cardiacs side project Mr and Mrs Smith and Mr Drake recorded the song to a new melody on their self-titled album in 1984.
*Richard Thompson&#x27;s own arrangement is the earliest song on his album &quot;1000 Years of Popular Music&quot; (2003 Beeswing Records).
* Emilia Dalby and the Sarum Voices covered the song for the album &quot;Emilia&quot; (2009 Signum Classics).
*Post-punk band The Futureheads perform the song a cappella for their album &quot;Rant&quot; (2012 Nul Records).
*The Hilliard Ensemble&#x27;s album &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot; (2002 Harmonia Mundi) opens with this song.
*Norwegian singer Charlotte Dos Santos released a version of the song on the album &#x27;Cleo&#x27;, in 2017.

===Film===
In the 1938 film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, Little John (Alan Hale Sr.) is whistling the melody of the song just before he first meets Robin Hood played by Errol Flynn. According to Lisa Colton, &quot;Although it appears only this once, in that fleeting moment the tune serves to introduce the character through performance: the melody was presumably sufficiently recognisable to be representative of medieval English music, but perhaps, more importantly, the fact that Little John is whistling the song emphasizes his peasant status...In &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, Little John&#x27;s performance of &#x27;Sumer is icumen in&#x27; locates him socially as a contented, lower class male, a symbol of the romanticized ideal of the medieval peasant&quot;.

The rendition sung at the climax of the 1973 British film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; is a mixed translation by Anthony Shaffer:
&lt;poem&gt;
Sumer is Icumen in,
Loudly sing, cuckoo!
Grows the seed and blows the mead,
And springs the wood anew;
Sing, cuckoo!
Ewe bleats harshly after lamb,
Cows after calves make moo;
Bullock stamps and deer champs,
Now shrilly sing, cuckoo!
Cuckoo, cuckoo
Wild bird are you;
Be never still, cuckoo!
&lt;/poem&gt;

=== Television ===

In the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Bagpuss&quot;, the mice sing a song called &quot;The Mouse Organ Song (We Will Fix It)&quot;, to a tune adapted from &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot;.

The children&#x27;s television show &quot;Strange Hill High&quot; has the song being sung by the students in &quot;The Snide Piper&quot;.

===Parodies===
This piece was parodied under the title &quot;Ancient Music&quot; by the American poet Ezra Pound in 1916 for his collection &quot;Lustra&quot;, but not published in the first two editions; it was published in the 1917 first American edition. In &quot;The Loathsome Lambton Worm&quot;, the unproduced script treatment for a sequel of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;, Pound&#x27;s variant of the poem was used in the place of the original.

&lt;poem&gt;
Winter is icumen in,
Lhude sing Goddamm,
Raineth drop and staineth slop,
And how the wind doth ramm!
Sing: Goddamm.
Skiddeth bus and sloppeth us,
An ague hath my ham.
Freezeth river, turneth liver,
Damm you; Sing: Goddamm.
Goddamm, Goddamm, &#x27;tis why I am, Goddamm,
So &#x27;gainst the winter&#x27;s balm.
Sing goddamm, damm, sing goddamm,
Sing goddamm, sing goddamm, DAMM.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The song is also parodied by &quot;P. D. Q. Bach&quot; (Peter Schickele) as &quot;Summer is a cumin seed&quot; for the penultimate movement of his Grand Oratorio &quot;The Seasonings&quot;.

&lt;poem&gt;
Carpe diem,
Sing, cuckoo sing,
Death is a-comin in,
Sing, cuckoo sing.
death is a-comin in.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Another parody is &quot;Plumber is icumen in&quot; by A. Y. Campbell:
&lt;poem&gt;
Plumber is icumen in;
Bludie big tu-du.
Bloweth lampe, and showeth dampe,
And dripth the wud thru.
Bludie hel, boo-hoo!

Thaweth drain, and runneth bath;
Saw saweth, and scrueth scru;
Bull-kuk squirteth, leake spurteth;
Wurry springeth up anew,
Boo-hoo, boo-hoo.

Tom Pugh, Tom Pugh, well plumbes thu, Tom Pugh;
Better job I naver nu.
Therefore will I cease boo-hoo,
Woorie not, but cry pooh-pooh,
Murie sing pooh-pooh, pooh-pooh,
Pooh-pooh!
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>The White Citizens&#x27; Councils were an associated network of white supremacist, segregationist organizations in the United States, concentrated in the South and created as part of a white backlash against the US Supreme Court&#x27;s landmark &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling. The first was formed on July 11, 1954. The name was changed to the Citizens&#x27; Councils of America in 1956. With about 60,000 members across the Southern United States, the groups were founded primarily to oppose racial integration of public schools: the logical conclusion of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; ruling.

The Councils also worked to oppose voter registration efforts in the South (where most African Americans had been disenfranchised since the late 19th century) and integration of public facilities in general during the 1950s and 1960s. Members employed tactics such as economic boycotts, unjustified termination of employment, propaganda, and outright violence. By the 1970s the influence of the Councils had waned considerably due to the passage of federal civil rights legislation. The councils&#x27; mailing lists and some of their board members found their way to the St. Louis–based Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985.

== History ==
===Founding and activities===
In May 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that the segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. At the time, schools and other public facilities were segregated by state laws in Southern states. The Citizens&#x27; Councils were founded in Indianola, Mississippi two months after the &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; ruling. The recognized leader was Robert B. Patterson, a plantation manager and a former captain of the Mississippi State University football team. Additional chapters were established in many other southern towns in following years.

At this time, most Southern states enforced the racial segregation of all public facilities; in places where local laws did not require segregation, Jim Crow harassment enforced it. From 1890 to 1908, most Southern states passed new constitutions or laws which disfranchised most blacks by imposing barriers to voter registration and voting. Despite the fact that civil rights organizations won some legal challenges, such as the prohibition on white primaries, most blacks were still disfranchised in the South in the 1950s. They risked retaliation by challenging the segregation of seating on buses as well as the segregation of seating at lunch counters, including segregation in department stores. The risks did not end immediately after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Patterson and his followers formed the White Citizens Council in response to increased civil rights activism, activism which it responded to with economic retaliation and violence. The Regional Council of Negro Leadership (RCNL), a grassroots civil rights organization founded in 1951 by T. R. M. Howard of the all-black town Mound Bayou, Mississippi, was based 40 miles from Indianola. Aaron Henry, a later official in the RCNL and the future head of the Mississippi NAACP had met Patterson during their childhood.
Within a few months, the White Citizens Council had attracted members whose racist views were similar to the views of its leaders; new chapters developed beyond Mississippi in the rest of the Deep South. The Council often had the support of the leading white citizens of many communities, including business, law enforcement, civic and sometimes religious leaders, many of whom were members. Member businesses, such as newspaper publishing, legal representation, medical service, were known for collectively acting against registered voters whose names were first published in local papers before additional retaliatory actions were taken against them.

====Racist ideology====
Council members published a book which was titled &quot;Black Monday&quot;. The book detailed their belief that African Americans were inferior to white people which served as the basis for their belief that the races must remain separate. &quot;If in one mighty voice we do not protest this travesty on justice, we might as well surrender,&quot; one of the authors, Mississippi Circuit Court Judge Tom P. Brady, wrote.

=== Extension outside the South ===
In August 1956, their official newspaper reported councils in &quot;at least 30 states&quot; in places such as Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis and Newark.

In 1964, the Councils published two advertisements in the newspapers of several cities, the first claiming that Lincoln was a segregationist and the second citing Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s quotes claiming that &quot;nature, habit, opinion have drawn indelible lines of distinction between&quot; both races.

As a result, interest for the Councils in the Pacific Northwest and Missouri emerged. Likewise, the 1964 George Wallace campaign created interest in Indiana and Wisconsin. Two full-time organizers were named to create councils outside the Deep South: former John Birch Society staff member Kent H. Steffgen was named for California, where the recent riots created interest for the Councils, and Joseph McDowell Mitchell, the actor of the &quot;Battle of Newburgh&quot;, was named for Virginia, Maryland and Washington.

===Demise and reconstitution===

By the 1970s, as white Southerners&#x27; attitudes towards desegregation began to change following the passage of federal civil rights legislation and the enforcement of integration and voting rights in the 1960s, the activities of the White Citizens&#x27; Councils began to wane. The Council of Conservative Citizens, founded in 1985 by former White Citizens&#x27; Council members, continued the agendas of the earlier Councils.

==Activities==
===Publishing and broadcasting===
Unlike the secretive Ku Klux Klan but working in unison, the White Citizens Council met openly. It was seen superficially as &quot;pursuing the agenda of the Klan with the demeanor of the Rotary Club&quot;. From October 1954, the council published a newsletter, &quot;The Citizens&#x27; Council&quot;, which evolved into a magazine in October 1961 and continued to be published until 1989 as &quot;The Citizen&quot;.

From 1957 to 1966, the Citizens&#x27; Council had a broadcast program, &quot;The Citizens Forum&quot;, where they exposed their doctrine of segregation. First broadcast by the WLBT as a television program, it switched to a radio format and was broadcast from Washington, DC, using congressional studios with the help of people like James Eastland, a U.S. senator from Mississippi. Various personalities such as Eastland or John Bell Williams were interviewed there. From 1966, they did emissions from African countries such as Rhodesia, interviewing Ian Smith.

Among its other activities, throughout the last half of the 1950s, the White Citizens&#x27; Councils produced racist children&#x27;s books, for instance, teaching that heaven (in the Christian conception) is segregated.

===Council Schools===
The White Citizens&#x27; Council in Mississippi prevented school integration until 1964. As school desegregation increased in some parts of the South, in some communities the White Citizens&#x27; Council sponsored &quot;council schools,&quot; private institutions set up for white children. Such private schools, also called segregation academies, were beyond the reach of the ruling on public schools. Many of these private &quot;segregation academies&quot; continue to operate today.

The Council sponsored a system of twelve segregated schools in Jackson, Mississippi.

===Voter suppression===
Citizens&#x27; Councils conducted voter purges to remove Black voters from election rolls.

Before the practice was found illegal in a federal court case of 1963, the Council pushed a public challenge law allowing two voters to challenge another voter to see if he was lawfully registered, a provision they used to purge the rolls of Black voters. In one parish, Bienville Parish, 95% of Black voters were purged. Similarly, the Council distributed such pamphlets as &quot;Voter Qualification Laws in Louisiana: The Key to Victory in the Segregation Struggle&quot; to white registrars and required them to participate in mandatory seminars about preventing Black registration and purging Black voters.

===Violence and economic harassment===
Although the White Citizens Councils publicly eschewed the use of violence, they condoned the harsh economic and political tactics which were used against registered voters and activists. The members of the White Citizens Councils collaborated in order to threaten jobs, causing people to be fired or evicted from rental homes; they boycotted businesses, ensured that activists could not get loans, among other tactics. As historian Charles Payne notes, &quot;Despite the official disclaimers, violence often followed in the wake of Council intimidation campaigns.&quot; Occasionally some Councils directly incited violence, such as lynchings, shootings, rapes and arson, as did Leander Perez during the New Orleans school desegregation crisis. In some cases, Council members were directly involved in acts of violence. Entertainer Nat King Cole was assaulted in Birmingham, Alabama while he was on tour. Byron De La Beckwith, a KKK and Council member, murdered Medgar Evers, the head of the NAACP in Mississippi.

For instance, in Montgomery, Alabama, during the Montgomery bus boycott, at which Senator James Eastland &quot;ranted against the NAACP&quot; at a large openly held Council meeting in the Garrett Coliseum, a mimeographed flyer publicly espousing extreme racial White Citizens Council and Ku Klux Klan views was distributed. Its rhetoric was a parody of the Declaration of Independence:When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to abolish the Negro race, proper methods should be used. Among these are guns, bows and arrows, sling shots and knives.We hold these truths to be self-evident that all whites are created equal with certain rights; among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of dead niggers.

The Citizens&#x27; Councils used economic tactics against African Americans who they believed were supportive of desegregation and voting rights, as well as African Americans who were members of the NAACP, and African Americans who they suspected of being activists. The tactics included &quot;calling in&quot; the mortgages of black citizens, denying loans and business credit, pressing employers to fire certain people, and boycotting black-owned businesses. In some cities, the Councils published lists of names of NAACP supporters and signers of anti-segregation petitions in local newspapers in order to encourage economic retaliation. For instance, in Yazoo City, Mississippi in 1955, the Citizens&#x27; Council published in the local paper the names of 53 signers of a petition for school integration. Soon afterward, the petitioners lost their jobs and had their credit cut off. As Charles Payne puts it, the Councils operated by &quot;unleashing a wave of economic reprisals against anyone, Black or white, seen as a threat to the status quo&quot;. Their targets included black professionals such as teachers, as well as farmers, high school and college students, shop owners, and housewives.

Medgar Evers&#x27; first work for the NAACP on a national level involved interviewing Mississippians who had been intimidated by the White Citizens&#x27; Councils and preparing affidavits for use as evidence against the Councils if necessary. Evers was assassinated in 1963 by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the White Citizens&#x27; Council and the Ku Klux Klan. The Citizens&#x27; Council paid Beckwith&#x27;s legal expenses in his two trials in 1964, which both resulted in hung juries. In 1994, Beckwith was tried by the state of Mississippi based on new evidence, in part revealed by a lengthy investigation by the &quot;Jackson Clarion Ledger;&quot; he was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison.

==Political influence==

Many leading state and local politicians were members of the Councils; in some states, this gave the organization immense influence over state legislatures. In Mississippi, the State Sovereignty Commission was established, ostensibly to encourage investment in the state and promote its public image. Although funded by taxes paid by all state residents, it made grants to the segregationist Citizens&#x27; Councils, in some years providing as much as $50,000. This state agency also shared information with the Councils that it had collected through its secret police-type investigations and surveillance of integration activists. For example, Dr. M. Ney Williams was both a director of the Citizens&#x27; Council and an adviser to governor Ross Barnett of Mississippi.

Barnett was a member of the council, as was Jackson mayor Allen C. Thompson. In 1955, in the midst of the bus boycott seeking integration of seating on city buses, all three members of the Montgomery city commission in Alabama announced on television that they had joined the Citizens&#x27; Council.

Numan Bartley wrote, &quot;In Louisiana the Citizens&#x27; Council organization began as (and to a large extent remained) a projection of the Joint Legislative Committee to Maintain Segregation.&quot; In Louisiana, leaders of the original Citizens&#x27; Council included State Senator and gubernatorial candidate William M. Rainach, U.S. Representative Joe D. Waggonner Jr., the publisher Ned Touchstone, and Judge Leander Perez, considered the political boss of Plaquemines and St. Bernard parishes near New Orleans.

On July 16, 1956, &quot;under pressure from the White Citizens Councils,&quot; the Louisiana State Legislature passed a law mandating racial segregation in nearly every aspect of public life; much of the segregation already existed under Jim Crow custom. The bill was signed into law by governor Earl Long on July 16, 1956, and went into effect on October 15, 1956.

The act read, in part:
An Act to prohibit all interracial dancing, social functions, entertainments, athletic training, games, sports, or contests and other such activities; to provide for separate seating and other facilities for white and negroes [lower case in original] ... That all persons, firms, and corporations are prohibited from sponsoring, arranging, participating in or permitting on premises under their control ... such activities involving personal and social contact in which the participants are members of the white and negro races ... That white persons are prohibited from sitting in or using any part of seating arrangements and sanitary or other facilities set apart for members of the negro race. That negro persons are prohibited from sitting in or using any part of seating arrangements and sanitary or other facilities set apart for white persons.In 1964, the Councils&#x27; membership was said to be nearly all supporting Barry Goldwater.

Major media outlets observed the support George Wallace received from groups such as White Citizens&#x27; Councils. It has been noted that members of such groups had permeated the Wallace campaign by 1968 and, while Wallace did not openly seek their support, he did not refuse it.

<doc id="663598" wikidata="Q177645" url="?curid=663598" title="Mayor of Montreal">
<text>The mayor of Montreal is head of the executive branch of the Montreal City Council. The current mayor is Valérie Plante, who was elected into office on November 5, 2017, and sworn in on November 16. The office of the mayor administers all city services, public property, police and fire protection, most public agencies, and enforces all city and provincial laws within Montreal, Quebec. The mayor is directly elected by citizens, by a plurality of votes, for a four-year term (unless a vacancy occurs). The mayor&#x27;s office is located in Montreal City Hall.

==History of the office==
The first poll in the history of Montreal was held on the day the first charter of Montreal came into effect – June 3, 1833.
On June 5, 1833 city council chose Jacques Viger as the first mayor of Montreal. The same day that Jacques Viger was elected mayor of Montreal, city council adopted a series of administrative by-laws, as well as ordinances to improve cleanliness in city districts. Andrew Steven Fox was appointed as the mayor&#x27;s medical advisor.

The first coat of arms of Montreal and the motto &quot;Concordia Salus&quot; were adopted on July 19, 1833 as proposed by Viger, incorporating the emblems of the main ethnic groups in the city. The rose represented England, the thistle referred to Scotland, the clover corresponded to Ireland, and the beaver, the French Canadians; this latter was replaced by the fleur de lys in 1938.

In 1851 city council decided to provide the first magistrate of the city with a sumptuous chain; it is an old English practice. The coat of arms of Montreal figured prominently in the centre of the gold chain. On October 2, 1851, that chain was passed on to Mayor Charles Wilson at a ceremony presided over by Lord Elgin, Governor General of Canada. The chain is now worn by each new mayor at the swearing-in ceremony. At the election in February 1852, Wilson became the first mayor elected by citizens.

Starting with the 2009 Montreal municipal election, the mayor of Montreal is also the mayor of the borough of Ville-Marie.

On November 5, 2017, Valérie Plante became the first woman to be elected as Mayor of Montreal.

==Vacancies==
If an incumbent mayor dies in office or resigns, the office is temporarily assumed by the deputy mayor, a position which rotates among different city councillors during the course of a normal council term. In 2012 councillor Jane Cowell-Poitras became acting mayor of the city following the resignation of Gérald Tremblay following allegations from the Charbonneau Commission.

Under provincial law governing municipal election processes, if the vacancy occurs more than one year before the next regularly scheduled municipal election, then a by-election is held to choose the replacement mayor. However, if the vacancy occurs less than a year before the next election, council has up to 30 days to hold an internal vote to choose one of its own members as the new mayor until the regular election. As Tremblay&#x27;s resignation occurred less than a year before the 2013 municipal election, his formal successor Michael Applebaum was chosen by the latter method, in a vote which took place on November 16. Applebaum resigned on June 18, 2013, one day after his arrest for corruption, and Cowell-Poitras again became acting mayor until Laurent Blanchard was selected in a council vote on June 25.

<doc id="663609" wikidata="Q2746323" url="?curid=663609" title="Gometra">
<text>Gometra () is an island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, lying west of Mull. It lies immediately west of Ulva, to which it is linked by a bridge, and at low tide also by a beach. It is approximately in size. The name is also applied to the island summit, which is a Marilyn. The island has been owned since 1991 by Roc Sandford, a wealthy environmental campaigner who lives mostly in London and part of the year on Gometra.
==Etymology==
According to Gillies (1906), Gometra is from the Norse &quot;gottr&quot; + &quot;madr&quot; + &quot;ey&quot; and means &quot;The good-man&#x27;s island&quot; or &quot;God-man&#x27;s island&quot;. Mac an Tàilleir (2003) offers &quot;Godmund&#x27;s island&quot;. The Norse &quot;Goðrmaðray&quot; may also mean &quot;warrior priest&#x27;s island&quot;. The Gaelic &quot;Gu mòr traigh&quot; meaning &quot;only at low tide&quot; has been proposed as the meaning of the name, but may be an example of folk etymology. Mediaeval charters render the name &quot;Gomedrach&quot;.

== Geology ==
Like much of nearby Mull and Ulva, Gometra is formed almost entirely from basalt lavas erupted during the early Palaeogene period. A couple of dykes are mapped cutting, and hence younger than, the basalt. In common with other such igneous intrusions assigned to the &#x27;Mull Swarm&#x27;, they are aligned northwest–southeast. Pipe-amygdales are present in some locations.

==Geography==

The island is agricultural, formerly growing grain for the Iona Abbey. Once home to a population of over a hundred, it is now down to a tight-knit community of a handful of people, up to a thousand blackface sheep, highland cattle, pigs, horses, a flock of feral goats, and red deer. Historical sites on the island include settlements, a burial ground, and the remains of two duns. It has no ferry. One of the few services it does have is a weekly postal service; Gometra issues its own local carriage stamps.

The island is part of the Loch Na Keal National Scenic Area, one of 40 in Scotland.

==History==
The island became part of the Kingdom of the Isles, during the Norse era. Whereas nearby Ulva and Staffa belonged to the MacQuarries from the 10th century, Gometra became a possession of the Iona monastery prior to passing into the hands of the Duke of Argyll. Dean Monro makes no mention of Gometra or Ulva in his 1549 work &quot;A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot; but both are referred to briefly by John Monipennie c. 1612, stating of the latter that &quot;about 300 paces from this island, lyeth Gomatra, two miles long and one mile broad&quot;.

In 1821 Ulva was sold by the trustees of the MacDonalds of Staffa to Lt-General Charles MacQuarrie, brother of General Lachlan Macquarie, the so-called father of Australia. After his death it was bought in 1835 by Francis William Clark of Ulva, a lawyer from Stirling, of Morayshire origin who began a brutal clearance of a substantial proportion of the inhabitants of Ulva within a few years. However the MacDonalds of Staffa retained Gometra until 1858 when it was sold to Donald MacLean, who built Gometra House.

==Current ownership==
In 1932, the island was sold to the English mountaineer Hugh Ruttledge (1884–1961), who had taken early retirement from the Indian Civil Service and planned a life as a farmer. While living on the island, Ruttledge led two British expeditions to Mount Everest, in 1933 and 1936, and took up sailing. In 1950, he moved to Dartmoor.

Gometra House had fallen into disrepair and parts were near collapse by the 1980s, but was reoccupied and restored as a family home in the 1990s. Millionaire and environmental campaigner Roc Sandford owns the island, which he bought in 1991. He lives “off grid” on Gometra for one third of the year and lives in London the rest of the time. The inhabitants of Gometra House, Roc and two of his young adult children, were profiled in &quot;Stacey Dooley Sleeps Over&quot;. The episode, entitled &quot;Eco Warriors&quot;, deals with their commitment to Extinction Rebellion and the realities of living on a remote, unserviced island.

In 2012, concerns were expressed by islanders about the siting of a large fish farm by the Scottish Salmon Company in Loch Tuath to the north of the island.

==Transport==
Weather and tides permitting, it takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes to travel by track from the houses on the west of Gometra to the ferry landing stage on Ulva for the crossing to Mull, using a 4×4 vehicle. The same trip can be done in 50 minutes on a quad bike. By boat from Acarseid Mhòr the journey only takes 20 minutes.

<text>323 Brucia is a stony Phocaea asteroid and former Mars-crosser from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was the first asteroid to be discovered by the use of astrophotography.

== Description ==

&quot;Brucia&quot; was also the first of over 200 asteroids discovered by Max Wolf, a pioneer in that method of finding astronomical objects. Discovered on December 22, 1891, when he was 28 years old, it was named in honour of Catherine Wolfe Bruce, a noted patroness of the science of astronomy, who had donated $10,000 for the construction of the telescope used by Wolf.

The asteroid is a member of the Phocaea family (), a large family of stony S-type asteroids with nearly two thousand known members. It was an outer Mars-crossing asteroid with perihelion less than 1.666 AU until July 2017. For comparison, asteroid 4222 Nancita will become a Mars-crosser in June 2019. was a Mars-crossing asteroid until January 2016.

&quot;Brucia&quot; has a synodic rotation period of 9.463 hours (as of 1998). According to the survey carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, &quot;Brucia&quot; measures 35.82 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.1765.

<doc id="663616" wikidata="Q522939" url="?curid=663616" title="Lion's mane jellyfish">
<text>The lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish (Cyanea capillata) is one of the largest known species of jellyfish. Its range is confined to cold, boreal waters of the Arctic, northern Atlantic, and northern Pacific Oceans. It is common in the English Channel, Irish Sea, North Sea, and in western Scandinavian waters south to Kattegat and Øresund. It may also drift into the southwestern part of the Baltic Sea (where it cannot breed due to the low salinity). Similar jellyfish – which may be the same species – are known to inhabit seas near Australia and New Zealand. The largest recorded specimen was measured off the coast of Massachusetts in 1865 and had a bell with a diameter of and tentacles around long. Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish have been observed below 42°N latitude for some time in the larger bays of the East Coast of the United States.

==Name==
The lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish is also known as the arctic red jellyfish, hair jelly, snottie, sea blubber or giant jellyfish.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomy of the &quot;Cyanea&quot; species is not fully agreed upon; some zoologists have suggested that all species within the genus should be treated as one. Two distinct taxa, however, occur together in at least the eastern North Atlantic, with the blue jellyfish (&quot;Cyanea lamarckii&quot; Péron &amp; Lesueur, 1810) differing in color (blue, not red) and smaller size ( diameter, rarely ). Populations in the western Pacific around Japan are sometimes distinguished as &quot;Cyanea nozakii&quot;, or as a subspecies, &quot;C. c. nozakii&quot;. In 2015, Russian researchers announced a possible sister species, &quot;Cyanea tzetlinii&quot; found in the White Sea.

== Description ==
Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish (&quot;Cyanea capillata&quot;) are named for their showy, trailing tentacles reminiscent of a lion&#x27;s mane. They can vary greatly in size: although capable of attaining a bell diameter of over , those found in lower latitudes are normally smaller than their far northern counterparts, with a bell about in diameter. Furthermore, larger specimens are typically further offshore than smaller ones. Juveniles are lighter orange or tan, very young lion&#x27;s manes are occasionally colorless and adults are red and start to darken as they age.

While most jellyfish have a circular bell, the bell of the Lion&#x27;s Mane is divided into eight lobes, giving it the look of an eight-point star. Each lobe contains about 70 to 150 tentacles, arranged in four fairly distinct rows. Along the bell margin is a balance organ at each of the eight indentations between the lobes – the rhopalium – which helps the jellyfish orient itself. From the central mouth extend broad frilly oral arms with many stinging cells called Cnidocytes. Closer to its mouth, its total number of tentacles is around 1,200.

The long, thin tentacles which emanate from the bell&#x27;s subumbrella have been characterised as &quot;extremely sticky&quot;; they also have stinging cells. The tentacles of larger specimens may trail as long as or more, with the tentacles of the longest known specimen measured at in length, although it has been suggested that this specimen may actually have belonged to a different &quot;Cyanea&quot; species. This unusual length – longer than a blue whale – has earned it the status of one of the longest known animals in the world.

== Behavior and reproduction ==
Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish remain mostly very near the surface, at no more than depth. Their slow pulsations weakly drive them forward, so they depend on ocean currents to travel great distances. The jellyfish are most often spotted during the late summer and autumn, when they have grown to a large size and the currents begin to sweep them to shore. Unlike most pelagic jellyfish, they are completely solitary and rarely travel in groups.

The lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish uses its stinging tentacles to capture, pull in, and eat prey such as fish, zooplankton, sea creatures, and smaller jellyfish.

Like other jellyfish, lion&#x27;s manes are capable of both sexual reproduction in the medusa stage and asexual reproduction in the polyp stage. Lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish have four different stages in their year-long lifespan: a larval stage, a polyp stage, an ephyrae stage, and the medusa stage. The female jellyfish carries its fertilized eggs in a tentacle, where the eggs grow into larvae. When the larvae are old enough, the female deposits them on a hard surface, where the larvae soon grow into polyps. The polyps begin to reproduce asexually, creating stacks of small, immature medusae called ephyrae. The individual ephyrae break off from the stacks, where they eventually grow into the mature medusa stage to become full-grown jellyfish.

== Sting and human contact ==

Human encounters with the jellyfish can cause temporary pain and localized redness. In normal circumstances, however, and in healthy individuals, the stings of the jellyfish are not known to be fatal; vinegar can be used to deactivate the nematocysts. If there is contact with a large number of tentacles, however, medical attention is recommended after exposure.

There may be a significant difference between touching a few tentacles with fingertips at a beach and accidentally swimming into the jellyfish. The initial sensation is more strange than painful and feels like swimming into warmer and somewhat effervescent water. Some minor pain will soon follow. Normally, there is no real danger to humans (with the exception of people suffering from special allergies), but in cases when someone has been stung over large parts of their body by not just the longest tentacles but the entire jellyfish (including the inner tentacles, of which there are around 1,200), 
medical attention is recommended as systemic effects can be present. Although rare, severe stings in deep water can also cause panic followed by drowning.

In July 2010, around 150 beachgoers were stung by the remains of a broken-up lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish along Wallis Sands State Beach in Rye, New Hampshire, US. Considering the size of the species, it is believed that this incident was caused by a single specimen.

== In popular culture ==
A photograph widely distributed on the internet appears to show an anomalously large lion&#x27;s mane dwarfing a nearby diver. The photo was subsequently shown to be a hoax.

On the television program &quot;QI&quot;, the show claimed that the longest animal in the world was the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish. This was later corrected – in 1864, a bootlace worm (&quot;Lineus longissimus&quot;) was found washed up on the coast of Fife, Great Britain, that was long. However, this claim is disputed, as bootlace worms can easily stretch to several times their natural length, so it is possible the worm did not actually grow to be that length. If that is the case, the lion&#x27;s mane jellyfish would indeed be the longest animal in the world.

The creature is referred to as the culprit in the 1926 short story &quot;The Adventure of the Lion&#x27;s Mane&quot; in &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

== Predators ==
Seabirds, larger fish such as ocean sunfish, other jellyfish species, and most sea turtles will only attack juveniles or smaller specimens while a fully grown adult is incapable of being eaten, due to their massive size and the abundance of stinging tentacles they possess, although both adults and juveniles have been documented eaten by anemones. The leatherback sea turtle feeds almost exclusively on them in large quantities during the summer season around Eastern Canada.

<text>Emil Grigoryevich Gilels (19 October 191614 October 1985, born Samuil) was a Soviet pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest pianists of all time. His sister Elizabeth, three years his junior, was a violinist. His daughter Elena became a pianist.

== Early life and education ==
Gilels was born to a Jewish family on 19 October 1916 (6 October, Old Style) in Odessa (then part of the Russian Empire, and now Ukraine) to Gesya and Grigory Gilels. His father worked as a clerk in a sugar refinery. 

Gilels had perfect pitch, and at the age of five-and-a-half, he began lessons with , a piano pedagogue in Odessa. A quick learner, he was playing all three volumes of Loeschhorn&#x27;s studies within a few months, and soon afterwards Clementi and Mozart sonatinas. Gilels later credited this strict training with Tkach for establishing the foundation of his technique. In turn, Tkach commented of Gilels, using a diminutive, &quot;Milya Gilels possesses the abilities of one who is born solely for the purpose of becoming a pianist, and that with the required attention to his development, the USSR would in the future enrich itself with the acquisition of a world-renowned pianist.&quot;
In May 1929, aged 12, Gilels gave his first public concert. In 1929, Gilels was accepted to the into the class of . Under the tutelage of Reingbald, Gilels broadened his range of cultural interests, with a particular aptitude for history and literature. In 1932, Arthur Rubinstein visited the Odessa Conservatory and met Gilels, and the two of them remained friends through the remainder of Rubinstein&#x27;s life. Like Tkach, Reingbald carefully guided Gilels in terms of allowing him to give live concerts, and protected her student from excessive concert performances. He competed in the All-Soviet piano competition, despite being below the age limit to participate, but won a scholarship from the jury.

In 1932, Gilels first visited Heinrich Neuhaus. In 1933, Gilels participated in the First All-Union Competition of Performers in Moscow, and won first prize by unanimous decision. This win made Gilels famous throughout the USSR, and led to a nationwide concert tour. However, the stresses of touring led Gilels to curtail his touring and to return to Odessa, to conclude his studies, even declining an invitation to transfer to the Moscow Conservatory. Gilels subsequently regarded Reingbald as his true teacher, mentor and lifelong friend.

Gilels graduated from the Odessa Conservatory in the autumn of 1935. Subsequently, he was accepted into the class of Heinrich Neuhaus as a postgraduate student at the Moscow Conservatory, and Gilels renewed his commitment to giving concerts. In 1936, he participated in his first international competition, the International Vienna Music Academy Competition. Gilels took the second place award, while his friend and fellow student Yakov Flier was the first prize winner. Two years later, in 1938, both Gilels and Flier participated in the Ysaÿe International Festival (Queen Elisabeth Competition) in Brussels. Gilels was awarded first prize, and Flier took third prize. Gilels completed his studies in Moscow in 1938.

==Career==
Following his activities in Brussels, a scheduled tour and American debut at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair was aborted because of the outbreak of the Second World War. Sergei Rachmaninoff, living in exile from Russia, had heard of the reputation of Gilels, and began to listen to Gilels&#x27; radio performances. Rachmaninoff subsequently regarded Gilels as his pianistic successor, and sent him his medal and diploma. This medal, engraved with the profile of Anton Rubinstein, and the diploma were once presented to Rachmaninoff to symbolize his succession from Rubinstein, and Rachmaninoff himself added Gilels’ name to the document. Gilels treasured these relics all his life.

In 1944, Gilels premiered Prokofiev&#x27;s 8th Piano Sonata. During World War II, Gilels entertained Soviet troops with morale-boosting open-air recitals on the frontline, of which film archive footage exists. In 1945, he formed a chamber music trio with the violinist Leonid Kogan (his brother-in-law) and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. Gilels was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1946. After the war, he toured the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe as a soloist. He also gave two-piano recitals with Yakov Flier, as well as concerts with his violinist sister, Elizaveta. In 1952, he became a professor at the Moscow Conservatory, where his students included Valery Afanassiev, Irina Zaritskaya, Marina Goglidze-Mdivani, Irina Smorodinova (a Laureate of the International Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud piano competition in Paris), Igor Zhukov, Vladimir Blok and Felix Gottlieb. He was chair of the jury of the International Tchaikovsky Competition at the inaugural competition in 1958, which awarded first prize to Van Cliburn. He presided over the competition for many years.

Gilels was one of the first Soviet artists, along with David Oistrakh, allowed to travel and give concerts in the West. His American debut was in October 1955, with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Eugene Ormandy. His British debut was in Coventry in 1951, where he performed alongside Igor Oistrakh, Galina Vischnevskaya, Mark Reizen and the composer Kabalevsky. In 1952 he played at the Royal Albert Hall. Gilels made his Salzburg Festival debut in 1969 with a piano recital of Weber, Prokofiev and Beethoven at the Mozarteum, followed by a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Third Piano Concerto with George Szell and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1981, Gilels suffered a heart attack after a recital at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and suffered declining health thereafter. He died unexpectedly during a medical checkup in Moscow on 14 October 1985, only a few days before his 69th birthday. Sviatoslav Richter, who knew Gilels well and was a fellow student in the class of Heinrich Neuhaus at the Moscow Conservatory, believed that Gilels was killed accidentally when a drug was wrongly injected during a routine checkup, at the Kremlin hospital. However, Danish composer and writer Karl Aage Rasmussen, in his biography of Richter, denies this possibility and contends that it was just a false rumour.

Gilels was married twice. He was first married to pianist Rosa Tamarkina in 1940. His second wife was Fariset (Lala) Hutsistova, a graduate of Moscow Conservatoire, whom he married in 1947. They had a daughter, Elena, a pianist who graduated from Flier’s class at the Moscow Conservatoire, and who performed and recorded with her father.

==Recordings==
Gilels is universally admired for his superb technical control and burnished tone. Gilels had a repertoire ranging from baroque to late Romantic and 20th century classical composers. His interpretations of the central German-Austrian classics formed the core of his repertoire, in particular Beethoven, Brahms, and Schumann; but he was equally illuminative with Scarlatti and 20th-century composers such as Debussy, Rachmaninoff, and Prokofiev. His recordings of Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Hungarian Rhapsody&quot; No. 9 and Sonata in B minor have acquired classic status in some circles.

Gilels&#x27; recordings for most of his recording history were for the state record company for classical music repertoire, Melodiya. These recordings, in turn, were licensed in the west under EMI Records, and in the United States under Angel Records (and EMI&#x27;s budget Seraphim Records). In 2013 Warner Classics absorbed EMI Classics, thereby acquiring the bulk of Gilels&#x27; recordings.

Gilels was in the midst of completing a recording cycle of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas for the German record company Deutsche Grammophon when he died unexpectedly in a hospital in Moscow. His recording of the &quot;Hammerklavier&quot; Sonata received a Gramophone Award in 1984. Gilels recorded with his daughter, including Mozart&#x27;s double piano concerto with Karl Böhm and the Vienna Philharmonic and Schubert&#x27;s Fantasie in F minor for piano duet. He also made some chamber-music recordings with the violinist Leonid Kogan and the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich.

<text>The Lackawaxen River is a tributary of the Delaware River in northeastern Pennsylvania in the United States. The river flows through a largely rural area in the northern Pocono Mountains, draining an area of approximately .

Its source is in the borough of Prompton in western Wayne County, at the confluence of the West Branch and Van Auken Creek. It flows past Honesdale and Hawley, where it is joined from the southwest by Wallenpaupack Creek and by Middle Creek. Water discharged from the Lake Wallenpaupack hydroelectric facility enters the river downstream from Hawley. The river continues east and joins the Delaware at Lackawaxen. East of Honesdale, it was deepened as part of the Delaware and Hudson Canal project.

The river is a popular destination for canoeing and recreational fly fishing for trout. It was reportedly where the American author Zane Grey first learned to fly fish.

Lackawaxen is Lenape for &quot;swift waters&quot;.

==West Branch Lackawaxen River==
The West Branch, approximately long, rises from a confluence of several small streams in the villages of Orson and Poyntelle in northern Wayne County, and flows south-southeast through Belmont Lake in Belmont Corners. After a second confluence, with Johnson Creek, it flows southeast through Prompton Lake reservoir, to a third confluence, with Van Auken Creek, to form the main stem.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class NEXPTIME (sometimes called NEXP) is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic Turing machine using time formula_1.

In terms of NTIME,

:formula_2

Alternatively, NEXPTIME can be defined using deterministic Turing machines as verifiers. A language &quot;L&quot; is in NEXPTIME if and only if there exist polynomials &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, and a deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot;, such that
* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, the machine &quot;M&quot; runs in time formula_3 on input 
* For all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, there exists a string &quot;y&quot; of length formula_4 such that 
* For all &quot;x&quot; not in &quot;L&quot; and all strings &quot;y&quot; of length formula_4, 
We know

and also, by the time hierarchy theorem, that

If , then (padding argument); more precisely, if and only if there exist sparse languages in NP that are not in P.

== Alternative characterizations ==
In descriptive complexity, the sets of natural numbers that can be recognized in NEXPTIME are exactly those that form the spectrum of a sentence, the set of sizes of finite models of some logical sentence.

NEXPTIME often arises in the context of interactive proof systems, where there are two major characterizations of it. The first is the MIP proof system, where we have two all-powerful provers which communicate with a randomized polynomial-time verifier (but not with each other). If the string is in the language, they must be able to convince the verifier of this with high probability. If the string is not in the language, they must not be able to collaboratively trick the verifier into accepting the string except with low probability. The fact that MIP proof systems can solve every problem in NEXPTIME is quite impressive when we consider that when only one prover is present, we can only recognize all of PSPACE; the verifier&#x27;s ability to &quot;cross-examine&quot; the two provers gives it great power. See interactive proof system#MIP for more details.

Another interactive proof system characterizing NEXPTIME is a certain class of probabilistically checkable proofs. Recall that NP can be seen as the class of problems where an all-powerful prover gives a purported proof that a string is in the language, and a deterministic polynomial-time machine verifies that it is a valid proof. We make two changes to this setup:

* Add randomness, the ability to flip coins, to the verifier machine.
* Instead of simply giving the purported proof to the verifier on a tape, give it random access to the proof. The verifier can specify an index into the proof string and receive the corresponding bit. Since the verifier can write an index of polynomial length, it can potentially index into an exponentially long proof string.

These two extensions together greatly extend the proof system&#x27;s power, enabling it to recognize all languages in NEXPTIME. The class is called PCP(poly, poly). What more, in this characterization the verifier may be limited to read only a constant number of bits, i.e. NEXPTIME = PCP(poly, 1). See probabilistically checkable proofs for more details.

==NEXPTIME-complete==
A decision problem is NEXPTIME-complete if it is in NEXPTIME, and every problem in NEXPTIME has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to it. In other words, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer. Problems that are NEXPTIME-complete might be thought of as the hardest problems in NEXPTIME. We know that NEXPTIME-complete problems are not in NP; it has been proven that these problems cannot be verified in polynomial time, by the time hierarchy theorem.

An important set of NEXPTIME-complete problems relates to succinct circuits. Succinct circuits are simple machines used to describe graphs in exponentially less space. They accept two vertex numbers as input and output whether there is an edge between them. If solving a problem on a graph in a natural representation, such as an adjacency matrix, is NP-complete, then solving the same problem on a succinct circuit representation is NEXPTIME-complete, because the input is exponentially smaller (under some mild condition that the NP-completeness reduction is achieved by a &quot;projection&quot;). As one simple example, finding a Hamiltonian path for a graph thus encoded is NEXPTIME-complete.

<doc id="663660" wikidata="Q507359" url="?curid=663660" title="Bentalha massacre">
<text>In the village of Bentalha (Arabic: بن طلحة), located 15 km (9.3 mi) south of Algiers, an incident occurred on the night of 22–23 September 1997, where a significant number of villagers lost their lives due to the actions of armed guerrillas. According to Amnesty International, over 200 villagers were killed. Different sources have reported varying numbers of deaths, with estimates ranging from 85 (the initial official estimate) to 400 (&quot;The Economist&quot;) to 417 (independent sources).

==Background==

In 1997, Algeria experienced a violent civil conflict triggered by the cancellation of the 1992 elections, which were expected to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Bentalha, a town located a few kilometers south of Baraki (refer to the map), a satellite town of Algiers, had voted in favor of FIS in the elections. Initially, some of the town&#x27;s residents supported the Islamist guerrilla groups that emerged after the cancellation of the elections and joined their ranks. The guerrillas in the area initially consisted of the revived Armed Islamic Movement (MIA) and various independent groups. Later, these groups were assimilated into the larger Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in 1994. The army maintained a significant presence in the area, with a post at the eastern entrance of the town, several roadblocks, and barracks on the north side of Baraki. The GIA also had a strong local presence and openly roamed the streets of Bentalha between 1994 and 1996, targeting individuals associated with the government. In June 1996, the government established a &quot;Patriot&quot; communal guard comprising approximately ten individuals in Bentalha.

On 29 August 1997, a massacre known as the Rais massacre took place a few kilometers southeast of Bentalha, resulting in the deaths of approximately 200 people. Widespread rumors circulated that more massacres were imminent. In the ten days leading up to the event, residents reported hearing the howling of jackals (which are not native to the area) every night, and helicopters could be seen flying overhead on a daily basis.

==Massacre==

On the night of 22 September at 11:30 p.m., explosions occurred in the Hai el-Djilali neighborhood in the southwest of Bentalha. Attackers infiltrated the area from the orange groves to the southeast of the neighborhood. They systematically went from house to house, resulting in the deaths of numerous residents. Eyewitness accounts reported that the attackers were armed with various weapons and engaged in violent acts. The event led to widespread devastation and loss of life.

According to Amnesty International, survivors reported that during the massacre, armed forces units with armored vehicles were stationed outside the village, preventing some individuals from escaping. Yacine, a survivor, stated that army vehicles appeared near the scene at midnight but did not intervene. Nesroullah Yous mentions that the army stopped locals from neighboring areas from coming to their aid. The assailants continued their conflict through Hai el-Djilali until approximately 5 a.m., when they departed without facing any opposition.

A photograph known as &quot;The Bentalha Madonna,&quot; captured by Hocine Zaourar, gained widespread circulation and won the World Press Photo award in 1997. The image depicts a grieving Algerian woman waiting outside Zmirli Hospital and has become an iconic representation of the Bentalha massacre, similar to &quot;The Falling Soldier&quot; photograph from the Spanish Civil War.

==Responsibility==

Responsibility for the Bentalha massacre, as well as the Rais massacre, was claimed by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in a press release from London on 26 September, according to Agence France-Presse. Fouad Boulemia, a prominent GIA member, was sentenced to death on 1 August 2004 for his involvement in the massacre, in addition to his previous conviction for the murder of FIS leader Abdelkader Hachani. The local GIA leader, Laazraoui, was killed in October 1997, along with another GIA member, Rachid &quot;Djeha&quot; Ould Hamrane. Nacira, the sister of Rachid Ould Hamrane, admitted to participating in the looting of the victims&#x27; belongings and pointing out the homes of sympathizers who should be spared. She also claimed that she was coerced into cooperating under the threat of harm to her life.

One survivor, Nesroullah Yous, later emigrated to France and published a book titled &quot;Qui a tué à Bentalha?&quot; (Who Killed in Bentalha?) where he shared his experience and argued that the Algerian government had infiltrated and taken control of the GIA. Yous highlighted statements made by the attackers, suggesting that they were aware the soldiers stationed outside would not intervene and expressed little regard for religious principles. Yous believed that the circumstantial evidence strongly indicated government involvement.

Following the Bentalha massacre, there have been differing viewpoints regarding the identity of the perpetrators and their motives. Some critics argue that the known affiliation of the killers with Islamist guerrilla groups renders the question of &#x27;who kills?&#x27; irrelevant, attributing the massacre to these groups. They have named individuals such as Laazraoui and Ould Hamrane as the leaders of the attack, with Nacira Ould Hamrane, Rachid&#x27;s sister, implicated in the crime. On the other hand, there have been voices challenging the official narrative, including Yous and Habib Souaidia, who have raised questions about the involvement of armed groups and the role of state institutions in the aftermath of the massacre. Algerian TV has criticized these individuals for their stance, accusing them of attempting to exonerate armed groups and discredit state institutions.

In Western academic circles, the Bentalha massacre has sparked controversy and differing interpretations. Hugh Roberts, for instance, acknowledges the detailed account presented in &quot;Qui a tué à Bentalha?&quot; and recognizes that it challenges the official version of events. However, Roberts also notes that Yous does not definitively establish the involvement of a special commando or death-squad, indicating the complexity of the historical narrative surrounding the massacre.

<text>The 96th Regiment of Foot was a British Army regiment, raised in 1798. Under the Childers reforms it amalgamated with the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot to form the Manchester Regiment.

==History==
===Formation===

The regiment was raised in Menorca (then called Minorca) as Stuart&#x27;s Regiment by Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Stuart from German-speaking prisoners of war of Swiss regiments in Spanish service on 12 December 1798.
The regiment embarked for Gibraltar in October 1800 and then sailed on to Abu Qir in Egypt in January 1801 to take part in the Egyptian Campaign. At the Battle of Alexandria in March 1801, Private Antoine Lutz of the regiment distinguished himself by seizing the colour of the 21st &quot;Demi Brigade Legère&quot;. The colour had initially been captured by Sergeant Sinclair of the 42nd Regiment of Foot but after Sinclair fell in battle, a French officer recovered the colour for his country. Private Lutz shot the French officer holding the colour and took possession of the colour before being ridden over by French cavalry. As two dragoons charged towards him, Lutz claimed to have shot the horse from under one, whose life he spared. He returned to the British lines with both the colour and the captured dragoon. The regiment sailed for home in autumn 1801. It was renamed The Queen&#x27;s Own German Regiment in 1802 and 97th (Queen&#x27;s Own Germans) Regiment of Foot in January 1805.

===Napoleonic Wars===
In 1807 members of the regiment were lost in the sinking of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The regiment embarked for Portugal in spring 1808 for service in the Peninsular War. It saw action at the Battle of Vimeiro in August 1808, the Battle of Talavera in July 1809 and the Battle of Bussaco in September 1810. It also fought at the First Siege of Badajoz In February 1811 and the Battle of Albuera in May 1811 before sailing for home in October 1811. The regiment was dispatched to Upper Canada in May 1814 and took part in the Siege of Fort Erie in August 1814 during the War of 1812 before arriving back home in July 1815. It was renumbered as the 96th (Queen&#x27;s Own Germans) Regiment of Foot in February 1816 and was disbanded at Limerick in Ireland in December 1818.

===The Victorian era===

The regiment was reformed (and subsequently confirmed as the successor of the predecessor formation with full continuity of battle honours), in response to the threat posed by the French intervention in Spain, in January 1824. The regiment embarked for Halifax, Nova Scotia in summer 1824, transferred to Bermuda in 1825 and then returned to Halifax in 1828 before embarking for home in 1835. Between December 1839 and August 1841, it provided detachments for convict ships sailing to New South Wales, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, South Australia and Western Australia.
In 1843, amid tensions in New Zealand between British settlers and Māoris related to breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, a detachment from the regiment was dispatched to the North Island of New Zealand. Four members of the regiment were killed in action at the flagstaff blockhouse when captured by a large Māori force during the Battle of Kororāreka in the Bay of Islands on 11 March 1845; the blockhouse crew were forced to withdraw to the lower blockhouse.
The regiment embarked for India in 1849 and, after returning to England in 1855, sailed for Gibraltar in 1856. It embarked for Canada in February 1862 to help suppress attacks by Fenians. One of the transport ships had to seek refuge in the Azores for a week in the face of extremely poor weather. The regiment spent only a brief time in Canada, the crisis having subsided, and returned to England in April 1862. The regiment deployed to the Cape of Good Hope in 1863 and then travelled on to India in 1865 before returning home in 1875.
As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 96th was linked with the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 16 at Wellington Barracks in Ashton-under-Lyne. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 63rd (West Suffolk) Regiment of Foot to form the Manchester Regiment.

<text>The Lackawanna River is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Northeastern Pennsylvania. It flows through a region of the northern Pocono Mountains that was once a center of anthracite coal mining in the United States. It starts in north Wayne County, Pennsylvania and ends in east Luzerne County, Pennsylvania in Duryea, Pennsylvania. The lower reaches of the river flow through the urban areas of Scranton, which grew around its banks in the 19th century as an industrial center. Its name comes from a Lenape word meaning &quot;stream that forks&quot;.

The river rises in two branches, the West and East branches, along the boundary between Susquehanna and Wayne counties. The branches, each about long, flow south, closely parallel to each other, and join at the Stillwater Lake reservoir in Union Dale. The combined river flows southwest past Forest City, Carbondale, Mayfield, Jermyn, Archbald, Jessup, Blakely, Olyphant, Dickson City, Throop, Scranton, Taylor, Moosic, Old Forge, and Duryea. It joins the Susquehanna River at the northern boundary of Pittston about west-southwest of Scranton. As part of the Susquehanna River, it ultimately flows to Chesapeake Bay.

By the mid-20th century, the river was severely polluted from mine drainages in its watershed. The decline of industry in the region, as well as federal, state, and private efforts, have improved the water quality. Still, the Lackawanna River is the largest point source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. The upper reaches of the river are a popular destination for fly fishing of trout. It was designated as an American Heritage River in 1997.

==Course==
The Lackawanna River begins at the confluence of the East Branch Lackawanna River and the West Branch Lackawanna River in Stillwater Lake in Clifford Township, Susquehanna County. It flows south-southeast for a few miles in a deep valley, crossing Pennsylvania Route 171 and passing through Forest City. The river then enters Clinton Township, Wayne County. Here, it flows south for more than a mile before turning southeast for several tenths of a mile. It then turns south-southwest for a few miles, meandering into Vandling, in Lackawanna County. The river only flows through Vandling for a few tenths of a mile before entering Fell Township. The western side of its valley becomes steeper again and the river continues meandering south-southwest for a while before turning west for several tenths of a mile and into Simpson, where its valley broadens again. In Simpson, it turns southwest and crosses Pennsylvania Route 171 again before receiving the tributary Wilson Creek from the .

After receiving the tributary Wilson Creek, the Lackawanna River continues flowing southwest alongside Pennsylvania Route 171 and soon enters Carbondale. After flowing for several tenths of a mile through Carbondale, the river turns south for a few tenths of a mile, receiving the tributary Racket Brook from the and crossing Pennsylvania Route 106 and a spur of US Route 6. It then turns west-southwest for several tenths of a mile and receives the tributary Fall Brook from the right before turning southwest for several miles. In this reach, the river passes through Carbondale Township and enters Mayfield. It eventually enters Jermyn, where it crosses Pennsylvania Route 107 and receives the tributary Rush Brook from the right. The river then turns south for a few miles, receiving the tributary Aylesworth Creek from the left and entering Archbald. In Archbald, it continues flowing south, receiving the tributaries White Oak Run and Laurel Run from the left. Several tenths of a mile downstream of the latter tributary, it enters Jessup and turns abruptly west.

After flowing west for several tenths of a mile, the Lackawanna River receives the tributary Grassy Island Creek from the left and continues flowing in a generally westerly direction for several miles. The river begins flowing along the border between Blakely and Olyphant. In this reach, it crosses Pennsylvania Route 247 and receives the tributaries Sterry Creek and Wildcat Creek from the left and right, respectively. Further downstream, the river crosses Pennsylvania Route 347 and receives the tributary Hull Creek from the right. It then begins flowing in a southwesterly direction along the border between Olyphant and Dickson City, though it makes several sharp turns along the way. After some distance, it receives the tributary Eddy Creek from the left and begins flowing along the border between Dickson City and Throop. After a few miles, the river enters Scranton and crosses US Route 6/Interstate 81. It then turns south for several tenths of a mile, receiving the tributary Leggetts Creek from the right before turning southwest. After a few tenths of a mile, it abruptly turns north, and then west-southwest before turning south. After more than a mile, it crosses US Route 11/Pennsylvania Route 307 and passes the Steamtown National Historic Site before turning south and receiving the tributary Roaring Brook from the left.

After receiving the tributary Roaring Brook, the Lackawanna River flows in a southwesterly direction for several miles, alternating between flowing south and flowing west. In this reach, it receives the tributary Stafford Meadow Brook from the left and eventually begins flowing along the border between Scranton and Taylor before receiving Keyser Creek from the right and beginning to flow alongside the border between Taylor and Moosic. After some distance along the latter border, the river crosses Interstate 476 and turns south, now flowing along the border between Old Forge and Moosic. After more than a mile, it begins meandering west, receiving Spring Brook and Mill Creek. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, it receives the tributary Saint Johns Creek from the right and turns west-southwest. After several tenths of a mile, the river exits Lackawanna County and enters Duryea, in Luzerne County. It continues flowing west-southwest through Duryea for a few miles before reaching the border between Duryea and Pittston. The river flows along this border for the remaining several tenths of a mile to its confluence with the Susquehanna River.

The Lackawanna River joins the Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth.

===Tributaries===

The Lackawanna River has 33 named direct tributaries and another 32 sub-tributaries and sub-sub-tributaries. Of the eight tributaries that drain an area of more than , Spring Brook and Roaring Brook are the largest, with watersheds than drain and , respectively. They join the Lackawanna River and , respectively. The East Branch Lackawanna River drains an area of and joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Leggetts Creek drains an area of and joins the river upriver of its mouth. The West Branch Lackawanna River drains an area of and joins the river upriver of its mouth. Other tributaries that drain an area of more than include Stafford Meadow Brook, Fall Brook, and Mill Creek.

==Hydrology==
The Lackawanna River and its tributaries are in &quot;good-to-excellent&quot; condition in its upper reaches. The river deteriorates slightly as it approaches Scranton, but becomes considerably more degraded downriver of Scranton. A large number of mine seeps, outfalls, and boreholes occur within the watershed. The aquatic habitat in the last is nonexistent due to acid mine drainage from the Old Forge Borehole, which discharges 100 million gallons of acid mine drainage into the river every day. Another 40 million gallons of acid mine drainage per day come from the Duryea Outfall. Other impacts include combined sewer overflows and urban stormwater. The stormwater discharges begin to become more common as the river reaches the Mid Valley region, and their frequency rapidly increases in the Down Valley region. The lower have a yellow-orange color due to iron oxide contamination. There are a total of 158 combined sewer overflows on the river.

Several reaches of the Lackawanna River have been designated as impaired between 1996 and 2004. The causes of impairment include pH, metals, siltation, and flow alteration. The source of impairment include abandoned mine drainage and resource extraction.

The Lackawanna River has a perennial flow. Nevertheless, it experiences low flow conditions during warm weather. The discharge of the river near Forest City was observed to range from 3904.83 to 69,568.83 gallons per minute, with an average of 35,584.83 gallons per minute. The river&#x27;s discharge near Archbald ranged from 3976.60 to 323,158.40 gallons per minute, with an average of 97,130.90 gallons per minute. Below the Broadway Street Bridge, it ranged from 34,560 to 586,397 gallons per minute and averaged 222,732.46 gallons per minute. Near Coxton Road, the discharge averaged 266,478 gallons per minute.

===Chemical hydrology===
In 2002, the concentration of iron in the Lackawanna River near Forest City was less than 0.3 milligrams per liter. The manganese concentration ranged from less than 0.05 to 0.175 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.1103 milligrams per liter. The concentration of aluminum ranged from less than 0.5 to 0.692 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.6255 milligrams per liter. The pH ranged from 6.1 to 7.4 (with an average of 6.7), the acidity concentration ranged from 0 to 10.4 milligrams per liter (with an average of 1.73 milligrams per liter), and the alkalinity concentration ranged from 16.4 to 32 milligrams per liter (with an average of 22.3 milligrams per liter). The sulfate concentration ranged from less than 20 to 30.7 milligrams per liter, with an average of 28.4 milligrams per liter.

The iron concentration in the Lackawanna River near Archbald ranged from less than 0.3 to 0.794 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.5 milligrams per liter. The amount of manganese ranged from less than 0.083 to 0.16 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.12 milligrams per liter.

The concentration of acidity was 0 milligrams per liter and the alkalinity concentration ranged from 17 to 38 milligrams per liter (with an average of 27.57 milligrams per liter). The sulfate concentration ranged from less than 20 to 136 milligrams per liter, with an average of 59.55 milligrams per liter.

The amount of iron in the Lackawanna River below the Broadway Street Bridge was typically less than 0.3 milligrams per liter, but once reached 0.348 milligrams per liter. The manganese concentration ranged from less than 0.067 to 0.139 milligrams per liter, with an average of 0.09 milligrams per liter. The aluminum concentration ranged from less than 0.5 to 0.753 milligrams per liter, with an average concentration of 0.63 milligrams per liter. The pH of the river at this point ranged from 6.7 to 7.3 (with an average of 6.95) and the acidity concentration was 0 milligrams per liter. The alkalinity concentration ranged from 19 to 36 milligrams per liter (with an average of 28.17 milligrams per liter). The concentration of sulfate ranged from less than 30.5 to 66.8 milligrams per liter, with an average of 46.25 milligrams per liter.

Between the upper Carbondale city line and Green Ridge Street, the concentration of alkalinity in various reaches of the Lackawanna River ranges from 14 to 34 milligrams per liter. The lowest concentration occurs in the reach from the Mellow Park Foot Bridge to Pennsylvania Route 347 and the highest concentration occurs in the reach from Pennsylvania Route 347 to Green Ridge Street.

==Geography and geology==
The elevation near the mouth of the Lackawanna River is above sea level. The elevation of the river&#x27;s source is between above sea level. The river is steep and sometimes narrow. Its average gradient between Forest City and Pittston is . For its first , the river&#x27;s average gradient is . For the next , the average gradient is . For the final , the gradient of the river averages .

In general, the topography of the Lackawanna River watershed consists of long, steep-sided ridges with valleys in between. The headwaters of the river are in a group of glacial ponds and bogs in Susquehanna County and Wayne County, about north of Forest City. The river itself begins at Stillwater Lake, which was built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in 1960. For much of its length, the river flows through the Lackawanna Valley, which runs in a northeast-to-southwest direction. Many tributaries flow into the Lackawanna River from West Mountain, the Moosic Mountains, or the Pocono Mountains.

The headwaters of the Lackawanna River are in the glaciated plateau physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains. However, the Lackawanna Valley is in the northernmost part of the ridge and valley physiographic province. The river also flows through a portion of the Coal Region. The Lackawanna Valley is part of the Lackawanna/Wyoming Syncline, which is a large syncline in the Allegheny Front and is the main geological feature of the watershed. The syncline is canoe-shaped, with a length of and a width of . The crests of the anticlines on both sides have been eroded away. An escarpment known as Campbells Ledge is located near the river&#x27;s mouth, where the Susquehanna Valley enters the 55-mile-long Lackawanna/Wyoming Valley.

A short distance downstream of the Stillwater Dam, the Lackawanna River flows through the Lackawanna River Gap and passes by the Stillwater Cliffs. Numerous other gaps, such as the Leggetts Creek Gap, Cobbs Gap, the Rushbrook Gap, and the Fall Brook Gap, occur on tributaries of the river. Downstream of Scranton, the river&#x27;s channel becomes broader and the river becomes shallower. Assorted waste and debris is piled in many places in the Lackawanna River watershed. The waste can sometimes block waterways, causing localized flooding. During storms, minor tributaries also wash large quantities of urban debris and coal waste into the river, degrading it further.

In its upper reaches, the Lackawanna River is highly rocky and flows over cobbles. It has virtually continuous whitewater. There are also a few strainers within this reach of the river, due to its small size. Ledges become more common downstream of Forest City and there is one &quot;distinctly high and nasty&quot; ledge near Simpson. Downstream of Carbondale, the river becomes quieter, though there are still some ledges. A few riffles disrupt the otherwise smooth reach between Interstate 81 and Moosic, though there are many ledges at the latter location. In Scranton, the river flows between stone and concrete retaining walls, as well as high banks of slag. In general, riffles and pools on the river form a &quot;watery stairway&quot;. The pools can be as short as a few hundred feet or as long as several thousand feet, with larger ones mainly correlating to broad floodplains. Rapids mainly occur in reaches such as Panther Bluff (in Fell Township), the Winson area (in Archbald and Jessup), near Cliff Street (in Scranton), and at the Moosic anticline (in Old Forge).

The channel of the Lackawanna River is sinuous and flows through narrow, alluvial floodplains at the base of steep hills.

There is a dam on the Lackawanna River at Forest City, and another one at Mayfield. A broken dam is located on the river below Jermyn.

The average annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of the Lackawanna River ranges from .

===Geology===
Deposits of glacial till containing boulders, cobbles, sand, and gravel occur in the Lackawanna River watershed. Some of the river&#x27;s flow comes from recharge from this till, via ponds and wetlands. Some flow also comes from cracks in sandstone and shale strata. Groundwater flow along the river has been impacted by manmade events in some reaches.

In the Lackawanna River watershed, the boundary between the Llewellyn Formation and the Pocono and Pottsville Formations occurs at around above sea level on both sides of the valley. Numerous waterfalls occur on tributaries at this boundary; well-known once include the Nay Aug Falls, the Fall Brook Falls, Blakely Falls, and Panthers Bluff.

The main rock formations in the Lackawanna River watershed contain sandstone and shale, with rich coal deposits. For instance, the Llewellyn Formation contains anthracite in the watershed, along with sandstone and shale. Under this rock formation lie the Pottsville Formation, the Pocono Formation, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Catskill Formation. The first of these is made of coal, shale, sandstone, and conglomerate, while the second contains red sandstones and shales. The Pocono Formation contains dense sandstones and conglomerates and occurs in outcrops on the Moosic and West Mountains. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs on the fringes of the watershed. A total of 67 percent of the rock in the watershed is interbedded sedimentary rock, while the remaining 33 percent is sandstone.

The uplands of the Lackawanna River watershed contain poorly drained, rocky soils. The rocky floor contains mostly developed, impervious surfaces, but some abandoned mine lands have rapid permeability.

==Watershed==
The watershed of the Lackawanna River has an area of . The mouth of the river is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Pittston and the source is in the quadrangle of Forest City. It also passes through the quadrangles of Avoca, Scranton, Olyphant, Carbondale, and Waymart. The watershed occupies parts of Lackawanna County, Susquehanna County, Wayne County, and Luzerne County.

Large parts of the Lackawanna River watershed, including its upper reaches in the Moosic Mountains, West Mountain, and the North Pocono Plateau, are largely forested. However, large areas of urban and suburban development occur in the river&#x27;s valley from Pittston to Carbondale, with some urban sprawl reaching as far as halfway from the river to the ridge tops. Abandoned mining land lies between many of the developed areas in this part of the watershed. Such land contains at least of culm banks, overburden piles, silt basins, non-vegetated soil, and degraded waterways. One of the main owners of forested land in the watershed is the Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry, which owns the Lackawanna State Forest that straddles the border between the Lackawanna River and Lehigh River watersheds. The Pennsylvania Game Commission also owns more than several thousand acres of Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed. Additionally, there are more than of wetlands in the watershed and another historically existed. All of the minor tributaries of the river begin in wetlands in the West Mountains or the Moosic Mountains. Riparian wetlands occur along the lower reaches of the river and a feature known as the Duryea Swamp is located in former mining pits at the river&#x27;s mouth.

Forested land is the most common land use in the Lackawanna River watershed, making up 58 percent of its land area. Agricultural land occupies 20 percent of the watershed and developed land occupies 16 percent of it.

As of the early 2000s, approximately 240,000 people inhabit the Lackawanna River watershed. The population peaked in the 1920s. The early settlers were of English, Irish, Welsh, and German descent, but in the 1880s and 1920s, immigrants from southern and eastern Europe arrived. The population has been in decline since at least World War II. The river passes through approximately 20 municipalities.

From Gilmartin Street to Depot Street, a distance of , the Lackawanna River is entirely on private property, but is open to access. From the Mellow Park Footbridge downstream to Pennsylvania Route 347, a distance of , 13 percent of the river is on public property and the remaining 87 percent is on private property, but is open to access. From Route 347 downstream to Green Ridge Street, only 1 percent of the river is on public property, but the remaining 99 percent is on private property that is open to the public. Water supply in the urban part of the Lackawanna Valley mainly comes from numerous reservoirs constructed between the 1870s and the 1930s. These reservoirs are mainly owned by the Pennsylvania American Water Company, but smaller companies own reservoirs and wells in the watershed as well. One example is a small reservoir in Covington Township, Lackawanna County, which is operated by the Moscow Water Company. The rural parts of the watershed are mainly supplied by private wells.

==History and etymology==
The Lackawanna River was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199891. The river&#x27;s name comes from a Delaware word meaning &quot;stream that forks&quot;. It has also been known as Gachanai, Hazirok, L&#x27;chau-hanne, Lackawannok, Lechau-hanne, Lechau-hannek, and Lechauwah-hannek.

===Early history===
Native Americans have inhabited the area in the vicinity of the Lackawanna River since at least 9000 BCE. An archaeological site at the mouth of the river contains artifacts from 9000 BCE (the Archaic period) to as late as 1400 (the Woodland period). Various rock shelters have been discovered on the ridgelines of the Lackawanna River valley; they were used by migrating hunter-gatherers in prehistory. A number of Lenape gravesites historically existed on the river near present-day Scranton, but were eventually destroyed. According to Horace Hollister&#x27;s &quot;History of the Lackawanna Valley&quot;, one of the destroyed graves may have belonged to Capouse, a Lenape chieftain who was visited by Count Zinzandorf, a Moravian missionary, near the river in about 1750.

A number of Native American trails historically existed in the vicinity of the Lackawanna River. One of these was the Minisink Trail, which went from the upper Delaware River to the Lackawanna Valley and the Wyoming Valley via Wallenpaupack Creek and the Moosic Mountains. This trail was later used by settlers from Connecticut, who turned it into a wagon trail the Connecticut Road. Parts of the trail still exist in the form of jeep trails.

The first European settlers arrived in the vicinity of the Lackawanna River between the 1760s and the 1780s from Connecticut and Philadelphia. Land claim disputes led to several skirmishes between the settlers and Pennsylvania settlers; these disputes were known as the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.

===1800s and 1900s===
For a time after the American Revolutionary War, the main industry in the Lackawanna River watershed was agriculture, though economic development was difficult to the mountainous terrain between the river and the coast. After the War of 1812, entrepreneurs began to take an interest in the coal reserves in the watershed. Coal was being mined near the tributary Racket Brook as early as 1820. By the 1820s, the Wurts Brothers had formed the Delaware and Hudson Coal Company to mine coal in the upper Lackawanna Valley and ship it to ports in New York. Due to the difficulties associated with building a canal over the Moosic Mountains, the company instead constructed a gravity railroad to transport the coal to the D&amp;H Canal and on to the Hudson River. In the 1840s the D&amp;H Company expanded their mining work further down the Lackawanna Valley, causing many towns in the area to enlarge. Coal mining was eventually done along the center of the Lackawanna Valley all the way from Pittston to Forest City.

In 1838, the Scranton and Platt iron workers build an iron works near the confluence of Roaring Brook with the Lackawanna River. The iron works eventually grew and became the city of Scranton. The iron and steel industry in Scranton ended in 1902. Additionally, virtually all of the old-growth forest in the watershed was cut down in the 1800s.

In 1852, the Scranton Brothers and other people developed the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, providing another route to the Lackawanna River watershed and contributing to the valley&#x27;s development. The Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad also went into the watershed, and the Erie Railroad had a number of routes into it. These included the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad, which followed Roaring Brook, and the Jefferson Branch, which entered the river&#x27;s watershed at Ararat Summit. The New York, Ontario and Western Railway, which was developed in 1890, was the last railroad to enter the watershed. It followed the river from Scranton to Union Dale before leaving the river&#x27;s drainage basin via the East Branch Lackawanna River watershed.

In the 20th century, the anthracite industry remained the largest industry in the Lackawanna River region, though there was also a silk and textile industry. Additionally, agriculture remained a significant industry in the watershed into the early 20th century. However, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a decline in mining activity. Mine pumping in the watershed ceased by 1961 and underground mining in the watershed ended on November 1, 1966, with the closing of the Continental Mine. Nevertheless, a small amount of strip mining and re-mining of previously mined sites has been done since the 1960s. By this point, the valley&#x27;s railroad system was shrinking due to decreased coal shipments.

A gauging station was established on the Lackawanna River at Scranton in July 1908, but was discontinued in July 1913. Another gauging station was set up at Moosic in August 1913.

===Modern history===
Flooding events occurred on the Lackawanna River in 1902, 1922, 1936, 1942, 1954, 1955, 1972, 1985, and 1996, causing millions of dollars in property damage. Flood control dams such as the Stillwater Dam and the Aylesworth Dam were built in the watershed in 1960 and 1970, respectively. A number of levees and floodwalls were also erected in response to the floods.

A number of investor-owned water companies were developed in the Lackawanna River watershed in the 1880s. These merged into the Spring Brook Water Company at Scranton in 1928. The Spring Brook Water Company became the Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company in 1960 and remained under this name until 1996. Eventually the Pennsylvania Gas and Water Company lands were sold to the Pennsylvania American Water Company.

The effect of coal mining on water quality in the Lackawanna River watershed was known as early as 1904. One early plan for recovering from the effects of coal mining in the watershed was the Scranton Plan of 1942. A large number of studies of the Lackawanna River&#x27;s water quality and habitat quality have been carried out. The Lackawanna River Corridor Association was founded in 1987 for the restoration and stewardship of the river. They created the Lackawanna River Citizens Master Plan between 1988 and 1990 and have also carried out stream walks and stream surveys on the river and its tributaries. In 1992 and 1993, the United States Army Corps of Engineers funded a study of the river&#x27;s greenway. The study was carried out by the Corps of Engineers, as well as the National Park Service, the Heritage Authority, and the Lackawanna River Corridor Association. The Lackawanna River Watershed 2000 program was funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency with the aim of alleviating problems from combined sewer overflows, acid mine drainage, and abandoned mine land.

As of the early 2000s, there are still 12 active mining operations in the Lackawanna River watershed. Only one has an NPDES permit.

==Biology==
The upper reaches of the Lackawanna River watershed are a habitat of national significance. Several important natural areas occur in the watershed&#x27;s upper reaches.

===Animals===
The main stem of the Lackawanna River is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from the confluence of the East Branch Lackawanna River and the West Branch Lackawanna River to the Pennsylvania Route 347 bridge at Dickson City. From this point downriver to its mouth, the river is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the river from its headwaters downstream to the Lackawanna County/Luzerne County line, a distance of . Five sections of the river are designated by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission as Class A Wild Trout Waters for brown trout. The sections are adjacent to each other and run from the upper Carbondale city line downstream to Green Ridge Street, a distance of . Both brook trout and brown trout inhabit the river, but only the former are native. In addition to trout, smallmouth bass, sunfish, carp, suckers, crappies, darters, and dace have been observed in the river. The fishery was nearly destroyed by 150 years of anthracite mining, but has recovered since the 1970s.

The Lackawanna River was historically a &quot;vibrant&quot; brook trout fishery. Shad may have also occurred in the river until the 1820s, when dam construction on the Susquehanna River closed off access by anadromous fish. There is anecdotal evidence that the river was able to function as a trout fishery in the early 1900s, though the habitat had experienced significant degradation by then. Recovery began in the once the coal mining industry had ended in the 1960s and 1970s, and continued into the 1980s and 1990s due to the efforts of local groups and fishing clubs.

A number of waterfowl species are common in the watershed of the Lackawanna River. The most common duck species are black ducks, mallard ducks, and wood ducks. Other birds in the watershed include belted kingfishers, great blue herons, and green backed herons. Birds of prey that have been observed in the area include ospreys, barred owls, coopers hawk, red tailed hawk, and sharp skinned hawk. Amphibians such as spotted salamanders and green frogs inhabit the watershed, as do reptiles such as rattlesnakes and snapping turtles.

Various other fauna, including a number of game animals, inhabit the Lackawanna River watershed. Common mammals include beavers, black bears, foxes, minks, muskrats, raccoons, and white-tailed deer. A few river otters are occasionally observed in the river.

Substantial reaches of the Lackawanna River have a healthy and diverse macroinvertebrate population.

===Plants===
Successional forest cover and forested wetlands occur in the upper reaches of the Lackawanna River watershed. Even in more urban parts, the river and many of its major tributaries have substantial riparian buffers. However, the riparian buffer is less substantial below Scranton. The watershed contains a temperate mixed forest with a high level of biodiversity. In the south, there are oak and chestnut trees, while in the north, the forests contain maple, ash, and hickory. However, the elevations and soils in the watershed also allow several arctic and boreal species to grow in the watershed. Appalachian heath barrens occur on the Moosic Mountains and West Mountains, with communities of scrub oak and pitch pine give way to sedges and lichens. Boreal plants such as tamarack, black spruce, and paper birch inhabit wetlands in the watershed&#x27;s upper reaches, as well as wetlands in the watersheds of Roaring Brook and Spring Brook. Pitcher plants, lady&#x27;s slipper, rhododendron, huckleberry, mountain laurel, and leatherleaf also occur in these wetlands.

Virtually all of the forests in the Lackawanna River watershed are second-growth forests or third-growth forests. As of the early 2000s, 88 percent of the river&#x27;s riparian buffer is intact or recovering. The stretches that lack any riparian buffering are most commonly on flood control levees in Dickson City, Duryea, Mayfield, and north Scranton. Property encroachments, coal dumps, and historic buildings in Archbald, Carbondale, Olyphant, and Scranton also detract from the river&#x27;s riparian buffer.

==Recreation==
There are numerous recreational facilities in the Lackawanna River watershed. These include state parks, state game lands, county and municipal parks, golf courses, Montage Mountain, and others.

Since the 1980s, the Lackawanna River has developed into a well-known &quot;outstanding Class-A coldwater fishery&quot;. The river is also a fly fishing destination. It has Trophy Trout regulations from Blakely Corners to White Oak Run, forbidding live bait except in limited circumstances.

About of the Lackawanna River are navigable by canoe during snowmelt and within three to seven days of hard rain. It is typically navigable when the United States Geological Survey gauge at Archbald reads over , though navigation becomes difficult when the gauge height is over . However, even in the summer, when the gauge height is often , a few pool reaches in Dickson City and Scranton are still navigable. The difficulty rating of the river from Stillwater Lake to Carbondale ranges from 1 to 3. From Carbondale to the river&#x27;s mouth, the difficulty rating is mostly 1, but there is one class-4 rapid formed by a complex ledge system at Moosic. The scenery above Carbondale is described as &quot;good to poor&quot; in Edward Gertler&#x27;s book &quot;Keystone Canoeing&quot;. The scenery below Carbondale is &quot;fair to poor&quot;. However, Gertler also described the area as &quot;a place that most of us associate with ugliness, with a capital U&quot;. A few of the larger tributaries are also seasonally navigable by canoe or kayak.

The Lackawanna River Canoe-a-thon has been conducted on the Lackawanna River annually since 1973. It was originally hosted by the Luzerne–Lackawanna Environmental Council and the Jaycees, but the Lackawanna River Corridor Association took over the role in 1988. The race was postponed once due to flooding and cancelled once due to drought.

A land sale of land in the Lackawanna River watershed to the private Theta Corporation generated some controversy. The sale caused many previously-use hunting lands to become restricted. However, the Theta Corporation and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission announced a cooperation to permit hunting on the lands was announced in 2001. At that point, the Theta Corporation owned of land in the watershed, including large tracts in the Spring Brook and Roaring Brook sub-watersheds.

<text>Kenan Thompson (; born May 10, 1978) is an American actor and comedian. He has been a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; since 2003, making him the longest-tenured cast member in the show&#x27;s history. He was also the first regular cast member born after the show&#x27;s premiere in 1975. Outside of &quot;SNL&quot;, Thompson starred on NBC&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Kenan&quot; from 2021 to 2022.

Thompson began his acting career in the early 1990s, and was an original cast member of Nickelodeon&#x27;s sketch comedy series &quot;All That&quot; (1994–2005), where he often collaborated with co-star Kel Mitchell. Beginning in 1996, they starred in their own sitcom &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; (1996–2001). Thompson also had roles in &quot;The Mighty Ducks&quot; franchise, &quot;Good Burger&quot; and its sequel &quot;Good Burger 2&quot;, and as the title character in the 2004 film &quot;Fat Albert&quot;.

He has been nominated six times for a Primetime Emmy Award for his work on &quot;SNL&quot;, winning once. He is ranked at No. 88 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Teen Stars.

==Early life==
Thompson was born on May 10, 1978, in Atlanta, Georgia. His parents are Fletcher and Elizabeth Ann Thompson. He has two siblings: an older brother and a younger sister. His family moved to Atlanta, Georgia, when he was 9 months old. Thompson&#x27;s mother enrolled him in acting classes at age five. His first role as Toto in a church production of &quot;The Wiz&quot; had no lines. He continued acting throughout his youth, appearing in school plays such as &quot;The Gingerbread Duck&quot;. He auditioned for a theater company, The Youth Ensemble of Atlanta (YEA). As a child, he was a fan of &quot;The Price Is Right,&quot; which he has called &quot;my first love&quot; and &quot;very joyful viewing&quot; that shaped his acting style.

==Career==
===1994–2002: Breakthrough with &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; ===
One of Thompson&#x27;s earliest roles was as an entertainment reporter for CNN&#x27;s &quot;Real News for Kids&quot;. He went on to star in the original run of &quot;All That&quot; for its first five seasons, playing such characters as Principal Pimpell, Miss Piddlin, Pierre Escargot, and Superdude. He starred as Kenan Rockmore on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Kenan &amp; Kel&quot; from 1996 to 2000, mostly while still working on &quot;All That&quot;. He began acting in his first film, &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot;, while attending Tri-Cities High School, a visual and performing arts magnet school in East Point, Georgia.

Thompson has starred in several films including &quot;Good Burger&quot; (1997), based on the &quot;All That&quot; sketch of the same title, and &quot;Fat Albert&quot; (2004), in which he played the title character. He has also had supporting roles in the &quot;D2: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1994), &quot;D3: The Mighty Ducks&quot; (1996), as well as films such as &quot;Heavyweights&quot; (1995), &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot; (2002), &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot; (2003), and &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003).

=== 2003–present: &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and acclaim ===

Thompson returned to sketch comedy when he joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2003, becoming the show&#x27;s first cast member born after its 1975 premiere. Thompson said he had sent several audition tapes to &quot;SNL,&quot; which dismissed him as looking too young; he said &quot;it was a couple years&#x27; worth of that&quot;. Thompson said that he feared his addition to the cast would be a &quot;disservice&quot; to the show: &quot;It was weird for me for a long time&quot;. Thompson was a featured player until 2005 (spanning the 29th and 30th seasons) and was promoted to repertory player at the beginning of season 31 (the 2005–2006 season).

In 2013, he began refusing to portray black women characters on the show and demanded &quot;SNL&quot; hire black women instead.

Thompson has been a cast member on &quot;SNL&quot; for 22 seasons, breaking the record for the longest-tenured cast member in the show&#x27;s history previously held by Darrell Hammond, who was on the show for 14 years. Thompson became the most senior cast member in the second half of the 2013–14 season, following the departure of Seth Meyers. Thompson also holds the record for most celebrity impressions performed on the show, performing 139, beating Hammond&#x27;s previous record of 107. Although early on he planned to stay on the show until something else came along, by 2019 he noted that &quot;SNL&quot; was his &quot;forever plan&quot;.

Thompson has been nominated for five Primetime Emmys for his work on &quot;SNL&quot;, winning once. He has thrice been nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, in 2018, 2020 and 2021. For co-writing the song &quot;Last Christmas&quot;, in 2017 he was nominated for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, an award he then won in 2018 for the lyrics to &quot;Come Back Barack&quot; (along with Chris Redd and Will Stephen).

In 2014, &quot;SNL&quot; head writer Brian H. Tucker noted that simply putting &quot;KENAN REACTS&quot; would get a script more laughs, further elaborating, &quot;Put him in your sketch somewhere, anywhere, and your sketch will get better. Because Kenan knows how to take ordinary lines and make them funny, and take funny lines and make them special.&quot; Similarly, Lorne Michaels in a 2019 article referred to Thompson as &quot;the person I most rely on in the cast&quot;. &quot;Vulture&quot; referred to him as the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to Phil Hartman, both being &quot;the glue&quot; of their respective casts.

Thompson&#x27;s celebrity impressions on &quot;SNL&quot; include Al Sharpton, Whoopi Goldberg, Bill Cosby, Charles Barkley, David Ortiz, O. J. Simpson, and Steve Harvey. He has performed in over 1,500 sketches, hitting the mark during the March 5, 2022, episode hosted by Oscar Isaac. In commemoration of his 20th anniversary on the show, Thompson received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on August 11, 2022. It was placed next to Lorne Michaels&#x27;s star.

In 2009, Thompson was a regular voice actor in the Fox animated series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;, portraying Sue Sezno who, like her last name, always says no. The series premiered on April 19, 2009, but was canceled after only four episodes due to low ratings and poor reviews. Thompson voiced the LeBron James puppet in Nike&#x27;s MVP &quot;Most Valuable Puppets&quot; commercials, which were produced to be shown throughout the 2009 NBA playoffs. Thompson also guest-starred as Gus&#x27;s estranged college singing buddy on the USA Network series &quot;Psych&quot; in the fourth-season episode &quot;High Top Fade Out&quot;. In 2011, he returned to Nickelodeon, guest-starring in &quot;iParty with Victorious&quot;, a crossover episode of sitcoms &quot;iCarly&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot;.

Thompson appeared as a host of sorts of TeenNick&#x27;s retro programming block, &quot;The &#x27;90s Are All That&quot;, appearing in many of the block&#x27;s early bumpers and hyping material. He would return to the block, eventually called NickRewind but at the time called The Splat, for &quot;All That&quot;″s 22nd anniversary, with segments filmed at the 2015 New York Comic Con.

In 2015, film ticketing website Fandango announced that Thompson would play their brand character, Miles Mouvay. Thompson would play Mouvay in 18 videos, eight 30-second commercials, and several comedic skits.

On September 23, 2015, Thompson appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; alongside former &quot;All That&quot; co-star Kel Mitchell in which they reprised their popular &quot;Good Burger&quot; roles as &quot;Ed&quot; and &quot;Lester Oakes, Construction Worker&quot;. They later competed against one another in an episode of the revived Nickelodeon game show &quot;Double Dare&quot; that aired in November 2018. In 2019, Thompson served as a judge for NBC&#x27;s comedy competition series &quot;Bring the Funny&quot;. He also became an executive producer with Mitchell for Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; revival, premiering in June. In May 2019, NBC announced they had picked up Thompson&#x27;s single-camera comedy &quot;The Kenan Show&quot; to series. The series, retitled &quot;Kenan&quot;, premiered in 2021 on NBC, featuring Thompson as a newly-widowed father determined to be a &quot;super dad&quot;. He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series after its first season. In May 2022, the series was canceled after its second season.

He appears in the third episode of the revival of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; as Ron, a Friend of the Kids in the Hall, and hosted the NHL Awards in June 2022. He hosted the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards on September 12, 2022. To promote &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s 50th Anniversary, Thompson made several announcements on the New York City Subway from February 10, 2025 to February 16, 2025.

==Personal life==
Thompson married model Christina Evangeline in 2011. On June 20, 2014, the couple had their first child, Georgia Marie. On July 31, 2018, they welcomed their second child, Gianna Michelle. 

On April 7, 2022, it was announced that the two had been separated for over a year, and are co-parenting their daughters. On June 15, 2022, it was announced that Thompson was officially filing for divorce.

In 2020, he became the spokesman for Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences&#x27; &quot;Let Yourself Woah&quot; campaign, and was set to host the 2020 White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner before it was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2021 would also see Thompson be named host of that year&#x27;s Nickelodeon Kids&#x27; Choice Awards and People&#x27;s Choice Awards. He also hosted &quot;The Jonas Brothers Family Roast&quot; on Netflix.

In December 2021, Thompson co-founded the production company and talent incubator Artists for Artists (AFA). Their first announced project, &quot;Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth Part 2&quot; is in collaboration with Mike Tyson and wife Lakiha &quot;Kiki&quot; Spicer and a sequel to the boxer&#x27;s 2013 HBO special. In March 2022, AFA fully funded the launch of Twenty Two Entertainment, led by actors Michael Rainey Jr. and Gianni Paolo, best known from the Starz series &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot;.

In December 2023, Thompson released a memoir titled &quot;When I Was Your Age&quot;.

<doc id="663686" wikidata="Q2336729" url="?curid=663686" title="Balanus">
<text>Balanus is a genus of barnacles in the family Balanidae of the subphylum Crustacea.
This genus is known in the fossil record from the Jurassic to the Quaternary periods (age range: from 189.6 to 0.0 million years ago.). Fossil shells within this genus have been found all over the world.

==Description==
The bodies of these organisms are totally enclosed by a stony gray-whitish shell. The size of these shells ranges from 5 millimeters to 10 centimeters. They take the form of a cone consisting of six plates fixed on the rocks. The active animal can only be observed within the water when the shell opens and the barnacles expose two branched appendages (cirri ) regularly hitting the water to catch food. They mainly feed on plankton.

==Habitat==
These barnacles can be found in coastal areas at low shallow depth, although they can also be seen living out of the water. They commonly colonize stones, rocks and shells. They are found in abundance on the shells of mussels.

==Species==
Species within the genus &quot;Balanus&quot; include:

*&quot;Balanus balanus&quot;

*&quot;Balanus uliginosis&quot; 
*&quot;Balanus vadaszi&quot; 
*&quot;Balanus veneticensis&quot; 
*&quot;Balanus withersi&quot; 

The species &quot;Balanus balanoides&quot; (common barnacle, common rock barnacle, northern rock barnacle) has been reclassified as &quot;Semibalanus balanoides&quot; in the family Archaeobalanidae, due to its membranous base.

<text>A yer is either of two letters in Cyrillic alphabets, [[Hard sign|ъ]] (ѥръ, &quot;jerŭ&quot;) and [[Soft sign|ь]] (ѥрь, &quot;jerĭ&quot;). The Glagolitic alphabet used, as respective counterparts, the letters (Ⱏ) and (Ⱐ). They originally represented phonemically the &quot;ultra-short&quot; vowels in Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic, and are collectively known as the yers.

In all modern Slavic languages, they either evolved into various &quot;full&quot; vowels or disappeared, in some cases causing the palatalization of adjacent consonants. The only Slavic language that still uses &quot;ъ&quot; as a vowel sign (pronounced /ɤ/) is Bulgarian, but in many cases, it corresponds to an earlier ѫ (big yus), originally pronounced /õ/, used in pre 1945 Bulgarian orthography.

Many languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet have kept one or more of the yers to serve specific orthographic functions.

The back yer (Ъ, ъ, italics &quot;Ъ&quot;, &quot;ъ&quot;) of the Cyrillic script, also spelled &quot;jer&quot; or &quot;er&quot;, is known as the &quot;hard sign&quot; in the modern Russian and Rusyn alphabets and as &quot;ер голям&quot; (er golyam, &quot;big er&quot;) in the Bulgarian alphabet. Pre-reform Russian orthography and texts in Old East Slavic and in Old Church Slavonic called the letter &quot;back yer&quot;. Originally, it denoted an ultra-short or reduced mid rounded vowel.

Its companion, the front yer (Ь, ь, italics &quot;Ь&quot;, &quot;ь&quot;), now known as the &quot;soft sign&quot; in Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian, and as &quot;ер малък&quot; (er malak, &quot;small er&quot;) in Bulgarian, originally also represented a reduced vowel, more frontal than the ъ. Today, it marks the palatalization of consonants in all of the Slavic languages written in the Cyrillic script except Serbian and Macedonian, which do not use it at all, but it still leaves traces in the forms of the palatalized letters њ and љ. In Bulgarian, it is debated whether the letter palatalises the preceding consonant or is a simple sound . See Bulgarian phonology.

In the modern Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet, ь is also used to represent the palatalization of the previous consonant, while ъ represents a lack of palatalization. However, ъ is only necessary for the purposes of disambiguation between a consonant and an iotated vowel in situations when palatalization should not occur, as by default it would. It is therefore rarely used. As it is not necessary to specify palatalization under those circumstances, the much more common ь is frequently used as a substitute for ъ without any ambiguity arising.

==Original use==
In Old Church Slavonic, the yer was used to indicate the so-called &quot;reduced vowel&quot;: ъ = , ь = in the conventional transcription. They stemmed from the Proto-Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European short and (compare Latin and Old Church Slavonic , &quot;&quot; &lt; Early Proto-Slavic &quot;*angulu&quot; &lt; Proto-Balto-Slavic &quot;*ángulas&quot; &lt; Proto-Indo-European &quot;*h₂éngulos&quot;). In all West Slavic languages, the yer either disappeared or changed to in strong positions, and in South Slavic languages, the strong yer reflexes differ widely, according to dialect.

==Historical development==

In Common Slavic, the yers were normal short vowels /u/ and /i/. Havlik&#x27;s law caused them, in certain positions, to be pronounced very weakly, perhaps as ultrashort vowels, and to lose the ability to take word accent. The weak yers were later dropped, and the strong yers evolved into various sounds that varied across different languages.

To determine whether a yer is strong or weak, one must break the continuous flow of speech into individual words, or prosodic units (phrases with only one stressed syllable, typically including a preposition or other clitic words). The rule for determining weak and strong yers is as follows:
*A terminal yer is &quot;weak&quot;.
*A yer followed by a non-reduced vowel in the next syllable is &quot;weak&quot;.
*A yer in the syllable before one with a weak yer is &quot;strong&quot;.
*A yer in the syllable before one with a strong yer is &quot;weak&quot;.

In Russian, for example, the yers evolved as follows:
*&quot;Strong&quot; yers are &quot;fully voiced&quot;: ь → е (or ë); ъ → о
*&quot;Weak&quot; yers drop entirely, but the palatalization from a following ь generally remains.

Simply put, in a string of Old Russian syllables, each of which has a reduced vowel, the reduced vowels are, in Modern Russian, alternately given their full voicing or drop: the last yer in the sequence drops. There are some exceptions to the rule, usually considered to be the result of analogy with other words or other inflected forms of the same word, with a different original pattern of reduced vowels. Modern Russian inflection is, therefore, complicated by so-called &quot;transitive&quot; (lit. беглые &quot;fugitive&quot; or &quot;fleeting&quot;) vowels, which appear and disappear in place of a former &quot;yer&quot;. For example (OR = Old Russian; R = Russian):
*OR сънъ → R сон &quot;sleep&quot; (nominative singular)
*OR съна → R сна &quot;sleep&quot; (genitive singular)
*OR ѫгълъ → R угол &quot;corner&quot; (nominative singular)
*OR ѫгъла → R угла &quot;corner&quot; (genitive singular)

<text>William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St Germans (1 April 1767 – 19 January 1845), styled as Hon. William Eliot from 1784 until 1823, was a British peer, diplomat and politician.
Eliot was born at Port Eliot, Cornwall, the third son of Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot and his wife Catherine (née Elliston). He was educated at Pembroke College, Cambridge, taking an M.A. in 1786. He served as an officer with the East Cornwall Militia.

From November 1791 until 1793 he was a Secretary of Legation at Berlin, from 1793 to 1794 Secretary of Embassy and Minister Plenipotentiary at The Hague and from 1796 Minister Plenipotentiary to the Elector Palatine and to the Diet of Ratisbon. Eliot also sat as Tory Member of Parliament for St Germans from 1791 to 1802 and for Liskeard from 1802 to 1823. He served as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1800 to 1804, as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1804 to 1805 and as one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury from 1807 to 1812.

In 1823, he succeeded his eldest brother John by special remainder as second Earl of St Germans and entered the House of Lords.

==Family==
Lord St Germans was married and widowed four times.

Firstly, in November 1797 at Trentham, Staffordshire, he married Lady Georgiana Augusta Leveson-Gower (13 April 1769 – 24 March 1806), daughter of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford. They had one son and three daughters:
*Edward Granville Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans (29 August 1798 – 7 October 1877), married Lady Jemima Cornwallis, daughter of Charles Cornwallis, 2nd Marquess Cornwallis
*Lady Caroline Georgina Eliot (27 July 1799 – April 1865), died unmarried
*Lady Susan Caroline Eliot (12 April 1801 – 15 January 1835), married Henry Lygon, 4th Earl Beauchamp
*Lady Charlotte Sophia Eliot (28 May 1802 – 8 July 1839), married Rev. George Martin, Canon of Exeter

After Lady Georgiana&#x27;s death of tuberculosis, he married again on 13 February 1809 at Heytesbury, Wiltshire, to Letitia à Court (9 August 1778 – 10 January 1810), daughter of Sir William Percy Ashe à Court. She died in childbirth along with their child.

On 7 March 1812 at the Earl of Powis&#x27; House, Berkeley Square, London, he married the earl&#x27;s niece Charlotte Robinson (26 March 1784 – 3 July 1813), daughter of John Robinson, MP of Denston Hall, and the Hon. Rebecca Clive (daughter of Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive (Clive of India) and Margaret Clive). She also died in childbirth, with no surviving issue.

On 20 August 1814 at Walton, Warwickshire, he married to Susan Mordaunt (15 December 1779 – 5 February 1830), daughter of Sir John Mordaunt, 7th Baronet, with no issue.

He died at Port Eliot in 1845, following an attack of paralysis. His only surviving daughter, Lady Caroline, was by his side. He was succeeded by his eldest son.

<doc id="663693" wikidata="Q1078597" url="?curid=663693" title="Artistic language">
<text>An artistic language, or artlang, is a constructed language designed for aesthetic and phonetic pleasure. Constructed languages can be artistic to the extent that artists use it as a source of creativity in art, poetry, calligraphy or as a metaphor to address themes such as cultural diversity and the vulnerability of the individual in a globalizing world. They can also be used to test linguistical theories, such as Linguistic relativity.

Unlike engineered languages or auxiliary languages, artistic languages often have irregular grammar systems, much like natural languages. Many are designed within the context of fictional worlds, such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. Others can represent fictional languages in a world not patently different from the real world, or have no particular fictional background attached.

==Genres==

Several different genres of constructed languages are classified as &#x27;artistic&#x27;. An artistic language may fall into any one of the following groups, depending on the aim of its use.
Similarly to philosophical languages, artlangs are created in accordance with an initially defined principle in mind.

=== Fictional languages ===

By far the largest group of artlangs are fictional languages (sometimes also referred to as &quot;professional artlangs&quot;). Fictional languages are intended to be the languages of a fictional world, and are often designed with the intent of giving more depth and an appearance of plausibility to the fictional worlds with which they are associated, and to have their characters communicate in a fashion which is both alien and dislocated. By analogy with the word &quot;conlang&quot;, the term &quot;conworld&quot; is used to describe these worlds, inhabited by fictional constructed cultures.

There are two major categories of fictional languages.

Professional fictional languages are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and songs. Prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the Middle-earth and &quot;Star Trek&quot; universes, Simlish in &quot;The Sims&quot;, games like &quot;Ico&quot; and the &quot;Ar Tonelico&quot; series, and songs of the French band Magma, singing in Kobaïan.

Internet-based fictional languages are hosted along with their &quot;conworlds&quot; on the Internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the sites&#x27; visitors. An example is Verdurian, the language of Mark Rosenfelder&#x27;s Verduria on the planet of Almea.

=== Alternative languages ===

Alternative languages, or &quot;altlangs&quot;, speculate on an alternate history and try to reconstruct how a family of natural languages would have evolved if things had been different, e.g.: What if Greek civilization had gone on to thrive without a Roman Empire, leaving Greek and not Latin to develop several modern descendants? The language that &quot;would have&quot; evolved is then traced step by step in its evolution, to reach its modern form. An altlang will typically base itself on the core vocabulary of one language and the phonology of another.

The best-known language of this category is Brithenig, which initiated the interest among Internet conlangers in devising such alternate-historical languages, like Wenedyk. Brithenig attempts to determine how Romance languages would have evolved had Roman influence in Britain been sufficient to replace Celtic languages with Vulgar Latin, and bases its phonology on that of Welsh. An earlier instance is Philip José Farmer&#x27;s Winkie language, a relative of the Germanic languages spoken by the Winkies of Oz in &quot;A Barnstormer in Oz&quot;. Another example is Anglish, which tries to reconstruct how English could have looked without Latin influence.

Although technically a professional fictional language, Wenja, used in the video game Far Cry Primal is an attempt an reconstructing an earlier stage of Proto-Indo-European, before the appearance of characteristics such as gender, ablaut or the s-mobile, to name a few.

=== Micronational languages ===

Micronational languages are the languages created for use in micronations. Having the citizens learn the language is as much a part of participating in the micronation as minting coins and stamps or participating in government. The members of these micronations meet up and speak the language they have learned when they are participating in these meets. They coin new words and grammatical constructions when needed. Talossan, from R. Ben Madison&#x27;s Kingdom of Talossa, is an archetypal example of a micronational language.

=== Personal languages ===

Personal languages are ultimately created for one&#x27;s own edification. The creator does not expect anyone to speak it; the language exists as a work of art. A personal language may be invented for the purpose of having a beautiful language, for self-expression, as an exercise in understanding linguistic principles, or perhaps as an attempt to create a language with an extreme phonemic inventory or system of verbs. Personal languages tend to have short lifespans, and are often displayed on the Internet and discussed on message boards much like Internet-based fictional languages. They are often invented in large numbers by the people who design these languages. However, a few personal languages are used extensively and long-term by their creators (e.g., for writing diaries). Javant Biarujia, the creator of Taneraic, described his personal language (which he terms a hermetic language) thus: &quot;a private pact negotiated between the world at large and the world within me; public words simply could not guarantee me the private expression I sought.&quot; The author Robert Dessaix describes the origins of his personal language K: &quot;I wanted words that described reality. So I made them up.&quot;

=== Languages with small vocabulary ===

The aim of such languages is to express deep meaning with very few parts. For instance, Toki Pona is generally said to have around 120, 123, or 125 root words and 14 phonemes. It was created by Canadian linguist and translator Sonja Lang for the purpose of simplifying thoughts and communication.

=== Jokelangs ===

The term jokelang is sometimes applied to conlangs created as jokes. These may be languages intended primarily to sound funny, such as DiLingo, or for some type of satire, often as satire on some aspect of constructed languages.

Some typical jokelangs are:
* Europanto – an unstructured mixture of European languages
* Transpiranto – constructed from international words inflected to sound like Swedish jargon, in order to improve malplacedness and ambiguity
* Oou – a deliberately ambiguous and polysemous language whose writing system is made up entirely of punctuation marks and whose phoneme inventory is made up entirely of vowels
* DiLingo – a rhyming language
* Gulevache – a fictional joke romance language created by the Argentinian comedy-musical group Les Luthiers for its opera Cardoso en Gulevandia
* Unwinese – the nonsensical but structured alternative English, also known as gobbledygook but named by its creator Basic Engly Twentyfimode, used by comedian Stanley Unwin
* Inflationary Language – invented by comedian Victor Borge, incrementing numbers embedded in words, e.g., &quot;crenine&quot; (&quot;create&quot;) and &quot;elevennis&quot; (&quot;tennis&quot;)

===Experimental languages===

An experimental language is a constructed language designed for the purpose of exploring some theory of linguistics. Most such languages are concerned with the relation between language and thought; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. In science fiction, much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. Artlangs of this type overlap with engineered languages.

<doc id="663694" wikidata="Q752488" url="?curid=663694" title="Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk">
<text>The Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk (or GT Hawk) was a grand touring coupe sold by Studebaker motors between 1962 and 1964. The top of the Studebaker line, it was the final development of the Hawk series that began with the Golden Hawk in 1956.

==1962==

===Redesigning the Hawk===
The GT Hawk&#x27;s styling was a fairly radical facelift by designer Brooks Stevens of the older Hawk shape; Stevens went after a European-inspired, clean look for the car he codenamed the &quot;Hawk Monaco&quot; (his prototype even had Monegasque license plates). The hood from the older Hawk was retained, but was given a more pronounced (imitation) radiator frame to more closely resemble the cars of Mercedes-Benz, which at the time were distributed by Studebaker. The grille inside the radiator frame was patterned after the Mercedes as well.

Despite the European influence, the Gran Turismo Hawk drew on American influences, too; the roofline was heavily inspired by the Ford Thunderbird, with thick C-pillars. A chrome edge running from front to rear highlighted the top of the bodywork in very similar fashion to that on the contemporary Lincoln Continental. The taillights were particularly fashioned after the Lincoln&#x27;s, and the trunk lid was given a faux brightwork &quot;grille&quot; overlay (to hide the grooves of the otherwise carryover 1956–61 lid) that resembled the Lincoln as well.

Stevens&#x27;s extensive yet inexpensive modifications to the body finally rid the car of the 1950s-style tailfins and bodyside trim of previous models. The rear window was nearly flat and recessed, reducing the cost of an ordinarily expensive piece of glass. Overall, the exterior look kept the smooth, aerodynamic style of previous Studebakers but moved up to date.

===Passenger compartment updates===
Stevens also cleaned up the interior with a modern instrument panel that could be ordered with a full complement of large, easy-to-read gauges within close range of the driver&#x27;s line of sight. The top of the panel was also padded for safety. This dashboard would prove to be another Studebaker trendsetter; later Chrysler models in particular (such as the 1977–1989 Dodge Diplomat) would have instrument arrangements clearly inspired by the Hawk.

The GT featured bucket seats and a console in the front, befitting a grand-touring car, and all seats were upholstered in either cloth and vinyl or all-pleated vinyl.

Unfortunately, the pleated vinyl (which was the overwhelming preference of buyers) was of poor quality during the 1962 production run and deteriorated rapidly. The problem was solved with the change to US Royal Naugahyde vinyl in 1963, but with sales already faltering, the reputation of the shoddy 1962 upholstery didn&#x27;t help matters.

==Chassis and engineering==
Because of Studebaker&#x27;s poor financial shape, the underpinnings of the car remained very similar to previous Hawks. For that matter, there wasn&#x27;t much difference, chassis-wise, between a 1962 Hawk and a 1953 Starliner/Starlight. This thriftiness has turned out to be a boon for owners of today, as Studebaker&#x27;s limited use of custom-engineered parts has translated into wide availability of replacement parts 50+ years after the firm&#x27;s demise.

For 1962, a Hawk buyer could choose from either two- or four-barrel carbureted versions of Studebaker&#x27;s 289-cubic-inch (4.7 L) V8 engine (210 or 225 horsepower) teamed with standard three-speed manual, overdrive four-speed or Flight-O-Matic automatic transmission. The stock engine was low compression (8.5:1) which lowered its power output while providing longer engine life.

Beginning with the 1963 model year, the &quot;Jet Thrust&quot; R-series V-8 engines designed for the Avanti could be ordered throughout the Studebaker line, with the naturally aspirated R1 delivering , the supercharged R2 giving and the limited-production supercharged 304.5 in³ (5.0 L) R3 powerplant issuing forth a full . Handling and braking improvements were made to match the high-performance engines, with front and rear anti-roll bars, rear radius rods, heavy-duty springs, and front disc brakes all available ala carte or in a &quot;Super Hawk&quot; package (introduced mid year) with an R1 or R2 engine. Avanti engines that were factory installed in Hawks (and Larks) had serial numbers beginning with &quot;JT&quot; (for R1) and &quot;JTS&quot; (for R2), rather than the &quot;R&quot; and &quot;RS&quot; prefixes used in Avantis.

At over 3,000 pounds the Gran Turismo was a sound performer with any of these engines; the stock 289 could get up to 18 mpg on the highway. The blown R-engines offered considerable power, with the 304 delivering well over one hp per cu in, putting it well into Corvette territory for the era. Despite the fact that Studebaker&#x27;s V8 was a heavy engine for its size, the Hawk was, with the Super Hawk package, a car with surprisingly good handling for a contemporary American car.

==Annual styling refinements==

===1963===
For 1963 the car was slightly restyled, with refinements to the front, sides, and rear. Round parking lights below the headlights replaced the previous rectangular ones, set into the corners of the newly closed side grilles that bore a squared pattern of lines over fine mesh. This same squared mesh pattern was carried over onto the main grille, replacing the simple fine mesh of the 1962 models. Early in 1963 production the parking light bezels were changed and the right side of the dash became woodgrain, matching the area around the instruments. The doors had red, white, and blue emblems added next to the Gran Turismo emblems, and at the rear, the aluminum overlay&#x27;s colors were reversed and red, white, and blue were added to the Hawk emblem on the top of the trunk lid. Inside, 1963 Hawks have vertical pleats in the seat upholstery, replacing the 1962&#x27;s horizontal pleats, and have far superior vinyl.

===1964===

For the 1964 model year, the GT saw some extensive design changes. Tooling money was finally appropriated to eliminate the grooved trunk lid that had required the 1962–63 Hawks&#x27; faux rear &quot;grille.&quot; The new, smooth trunklid bore a script &quot;Studebaker Hawk&quot; nameplate. Another grille change was made, this time with two new features: A Hawk emblem was centered in the grille, and a circle-S hood ornament (shared with the regular &#x27;64 Studebaker passenger cars) graced the top of the grille shell.

Perhaps the most interesting and notable exterior change involved the top of the car. Stevens, who had envisioned a half-vinyl-covered roof as part of the original Gran Turismo design, finally got his way with the &#x27;64 model. The new &quot;Sport Roof&quot; was made available in two colors (white or black) at a cost of $65.

New wheelcovers, shared with the rest of Studebaker&#x27;s 1964 passenger-car line, were also added, along with painted dots on the headliner vinyl (replacing holes used in 1962–63), new silver-threaded cloth upholstery, larger upper-instrument-panel pad and a new lower-instrument-panel pad, and horizontal pleats on the side upholstery panels (replacing vertical ones). And, for the first time, Hawk buyers could order an AM-FM radio as a factory-installed option.

When Studebaker closed its South Bend, Indiana plant in December 1963, the GT Hawk was among the models discontinued by the company, which consolidated all production in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where manufacture of the Lark lasted only two more years, using Chevrolet-based engines.

==Motor sport==
Andy Granatelli, then president of Studebaker&#x27;s Paxton Products Division, took two 1964-model Gran Turismo Hawks to the Bonneville Salt Flats in September and October 1963. Both cars, which left the South Bend factory with regular-production 289 V8 engines, were retrofitted with R-series high-performance 304.5 cu. in. V8s that were built for Studebaker by Paxton.

At Bonneville during the September session, the R3-powered car (which was supercharged), designated #5, ran the flying kilometer at a speed of . The R4-powered car (naturally aspirated, but with dual four-barrel carburetors), car #4, set a fastest average speed of .

When Granatelli and company returned to the flats in October, the R3 car was driven to a top speed of , while the R4 car made several runs at more than .

The Hawks were among several Studebakers that were run at Bonneville during this time period. The company&#x27;s cars set 72 USAC records in September, and raised that to 337 the following month. Most of the records were set by the company&#x27;s Lark-based Daytona convertibles, but the Hawks made a more than credible showing.

Impressed by this display of performance, Indianapolis, Indiana&#x27;s Dick Passwater, a USAC and NASCAR Grand National driver in the 1950s and 1960s, purchased the R3-powered car from Granatelli following the Bonneville runs. Passwater convinced Studebaker to sponsor him, and he entered the car in the 1964 Yankee 300, as well as some other races, including some on dirt tracks. The car&#x27;s best showing came in the Yankee 300, when Passwater finished tenth despite having brake problems with the car that forced him out of the race.

==Sales==
Despite Studebaker&#x27;s efforts to revitalize the Hawk, sales were slow, as indicated by the figures shown below. Sales figures for two of the GT Hawk&#x27;s primary competitors, the Ford Thunderbird and the Pontiac Grand Prix, are included for comparison purposes:
* &quot;Studebaker ceased production at its South Bend factory, including all GT Hawk production, on 20 December 1963. Figures shown for the 1964 Thunderbird and Grand Prix are for the entire 1964 model year.&quot;

Studebaker considered the GT Hawk very much a European-style GT, and accordingly the car was sold in Europe and elsewhere, though not in great numbers. Models shipped to Great Britain and Australia were equipped with right-hand-drive. 1962 and 1963 models were also assembled in Australia.

<text>Engineered languages (often abbreviated to engelangs, or, less commonly, engilangs) are constructed languages devised to test or prove some hypotheses about how languages work or might work. There are at least three subcategories, philosophical languages (or ideal languages), logical languages (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;loglangs&quot;), and experimental languages. Raymond Brown describes engineered languages as &quot;languages that are designed to specified &quot;objective&quot; criteria, and modeled to meet those criteria&quot;.

Some engineered languages have been considered candidate global auxiliary languages, and some languages intended as international auxiliary languages have certain &quot;engineered&quot; aspects (in which they are more regular and systematic than their natural language sources).

== Logical languages ==

Logical languages are meant to allow (or enforce) unambiguous statements. They are typically based on predicate logic but can also be based on any system of formal logic. The two best-known logical languages are the predicate languages Loglan and its successor Lojban. They both aim to eliminate syntactical ambiguity and reduce semantic ambiguity to a minimum. In particular, the grammar of Lojban is carefully engineered to express such predicate logic in an unambiguous manner. Toaq and Eberban are also logical languages.

== Philosophical languages ==

Philosophical languages are designed to reflect some aspect of philosophy, particularly with respect to the nature or potential of any given language. John Wilkins&#x27; Real Character and Edward Powell Foster&#x27;s Ro constructed their words using a taxonomic tree. Vocabularies of oligosynthetic languages, for example Ygyde, are made of compound words, which are coined from a small (theoretically minimal) set of morphemes. Sonja Lang&#x27;s Toki Pona is based on minimalistic simplicity.

== Experimental languages ==

An experimental language is a constructed language designed for the purpose of exploring some element in the theory of linguistics. Most such languages are concerned with the relation between language and thought; however, languages have been constructed to explore other aspects of language as well. 

In science fiction, much work has been done on the assumption popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. Suzette Haden Elgin&#x27;s Láadan is designed to lexicalize and grammaticalize the concepts and distinctions important to women, based on muted group theory.

Story of Your Life is a short story by Ted Chiang that heavily features a written-only non-linear language (text in it has no discernible beginning or end) in the form of its Heptapod B, though the language is only described vaguely and never actually shown. This story was adapted into the movie Arrival, though its version of Heptapod B is only non-linear to a certain extent.

<doc id="663697" wikidata="Q876491" url="?curid=663697" title="Gray mouse lemur">
<text>The gray mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), grey mouse lemur or lesser mouse lemur is a small lemur, a type of strepsirrhine primate, found only on the island of Madagascar. Weighing , it is the largest of the mouse lemurs (genus &quot;Microcebus&quot;), a group that includes the smallest primates in the world. The species is named for its mouse-like size and coloration and is known locally (in Malagasy) as &quot;tsidy&quot;, &quot;koitsiky&quot;, &quot;titilivaha&quot;, &quot;pondiky&quot;, and &quot;vakiandry&quot;. The gray mouse lemur and all other mouse lemurs are considered cryptic species, as they are nearly indistinguishable from each other by appearance. For this reason, the gray mouse lemur was considered the only mouse lemur species for decades until more recent studies began to distinguish between the species.

Like all mouse lemurs, this species is nocturnal and arboreal. It is very active, and though it forages alone, groups of males and females form sleeping groups and share tree holes during the day. It exhibits a form of dormancy called torpor during the cool, dry winter months, and in some cases undergoes seasonal torpor (or hibernation), which is unusual for primates. The gray mouse lemur can be found in several types of forest throughout western and southern Madagascar. Its diet consists primarily of fruit, insects, flowers, and nectar. In the wild, its natural predators include owls, snakes, and endemic mammalian predators. Predation pressure is higher for this species than among any other primate species, with one out of four individuals taken by a predator each year. This is counterbalanced by its high reproductive rate. Breeding is seasonal, and distinct vocalizations are used to prevent hybridization with species that overlap its range. Gestation lasts approximately 60 days, and typically two young are born. The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year. The gray mouse lemur has a reproductive lifespan of five years, although captive individuals have been reported to live up to 15 years.

Although threatened by deforestation, habitat degradation, and live capture for the pet trade, it is considered one of Madagascar&#x27;s most abundant small native mammals. It can tolerate moderate food shortages by experiencing daily torpor to conserve energy, but extended food shortages due to climate change may pose a significant risk to the species.

==Etymology==
The gray or lesser mouse lemur is named for its brownish-gray fur and mouse-like size and appearance. The genus name, &quot;Microcebus&quot;, derives from the Greek words &quot;mikros&quot;, meaning &quot;small&quot;, and &quot;kebos&quot;, meaning &quot;monkey&quot;. The Latin version of &quot;kebos&quot;, &quot;cebus&quot;, is a common suffix used for primate names, despite the fact that the gray mouse lemur is a lemur, and not a monkey. The species name, &quot;murinus&quot;, means &quot;mouse-like&quot; and derives from the Latin word &quot;mus&quot;, or &quot;mouse&quot;, and the Latin suffix &quot;-inus&quot;, which means &quot;like&quot;.

The lemur is known locally by several names in Malagasy, depending upon the region. Around Tôlanaro (Fort Dauphin), it is called &quot;pondiky&quot; . In the northern end of its range, it is known as &quot;tsidy&quot; . Around Morondava, it is referred to as &quot;koitsiky&quot; , &quot;titilivaha&quot; , and &quot;vakiandry&quot; . In many cases, these Malagasy names are also used for other visually indistinguishable mouse lemur species that live within its range.

==Taxonomy==
As its name implies, the gray mouse lemur is a lemur, a type of primate, and belongs to the suborder Strepsirrhini and infraorder Lemuriformes. Within Lemuriformes, it belongs to the family Cheirogaleidae, which contains the mouse lemurs, dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and hairy-eared dwarf lemur. The mouse lemur genus &quot;Microcebus&quot; includes the smallest primates in the world. Phylogenetic analyses of D-loop DNA sequences of various lemur species suggest that the gray mouse lemur may be most closely related to the reddish-gray mouse lemur (&quot;M. griseorufus&quot;).

In 1777, the English illustrator John Frederick Miller included a hand-coloured plate of the gray mouse lemur in his &quot;Icones animalium et plantarum&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Lemur murinus&quot;. The species was moved to the genus &quot;Microcebus&quot; by the French naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1834. &quot;M. murinus&quot; remained the only species of its genus, as well as the name used for all mouse lemurs on Madagascar, between the first major taxonomic revision in 1931 and an extensive field study conducted in 1972. The field study distinguished the brown mouse lemur, &quot;M. rufus&quot;—then considered a subspecies—as a distinct, sympatric species in the southeastern part of the island. Upon this revision, the gray mouse lemur was thought to account for all mouse lemurs that lived in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur represented the eastern rainforest mouse lemurs. More recently, scientific understanding of the distribution and diversity of the mouse lemurs has become much more complex. Additional field studies, genetic testing, and resulting taxonomic revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new mouse lemur species, demonstrating that the genus includes at least 17 cryptic species.

==Anatomy and physiology==

The gray mouse lemur shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, including soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe down the back (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.

The gray mouse lemur is one of the smallest primates in the world, yet it is also the largest mouse lemur. Its total length is , with a head-body length of and a tail length of . The average weight for this species is , with ranges of and reported. This is smaller than the world&#x27;s smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset, which ranges between . Weight varies by season, with both sexes building fat reserves, up to 35% of their body weight, in the tail and hind legs prior to the dry season and periods of dormancy. The tail of the gray mouse lemur can increase fourfold in volume during the wet season when it is storing fat. Even in captivity when environmental limitations are not an issue, mouse lemurs have shown a seasonal dietary preference with a greater protein intake during what would be their more active season.

Researchers have identified differences in the tooth morphology of the first and second molars between the gray mouse lemur and the reddish-gray mouse lemur. In the reddish-gray mouse lemur, the first lower molar (m1) is squared and both the first and second upper molars (M1 and M2) have slight indentations around the middle of the posterior margin. The gray mouse lemur has a more elongated m1 and lacks the aforementioned indentation on M1 and M2. In terms of its general dentition, the gray mouse lemur shares the same dental formula as all other members of its family, Cheirogaleidae: 

This species has 66 chromosomes, closely resembling the karyotype of the dwarf lemurs (genus &quot;Cheirogaleus&quot;). Except for the X chromosome, all chromosomes are acrocentric (with the short arm absent or virtually absent). Its genome size is 3.12 picograms (pg).
==Ecology==
Like all other members of the family Cheirogaleidae, the gray mouse lemur is nocturnal and arboreal. It inhabits lowland tropical dry forest, sub-arid thorn scrub, gallery forest, spiny forest, eastern littoral forest, dry deciduous forests, semi-humid deciduous, moist lowland forest, transitional forest, and secondary forests or degraded forests (including plantations) all ranging up to above sea level. The species is more common in secondary forest than in primary forest, particularly bush and scrub habitat, where it occupies a &quot;fine branch&quot; niche, restricting the vertical range to fine branches, fine terminal supports, lianas and dense foliage. These lemurs are usually seen on branches less than in diameter. The gray mouse lemur tends to prefer lower levels of the forest and the understory, where branches and vegetation are dense.

In secondary forest, it is generally observed from ground level up to above ground, yet in the canopy of primary forest. Studies have found that the species can spend as much as 40% of its time below , with 70% of its time spent at this level during the end of the dry season, when plant food is limited and insects compose a larger percentage of the diet. The species is more numerous in spiny forest, such as the Andohahela Special Reserve, than in the gallery forest, preferring drier, littoral forest, whereas the brown mouse lemur prefers inland rain forest.

The limits of the distribution are poorly understood. It is believed to range from the Onilahy River or Lake Tsimanampetsotsa in the south to Ankarafantsika National Park in the north. There is also an isolated and disjointed population in the southeastern part of the island, near Tôlanaro and the Andohahela National Park, up to the Mandena Conservation Zone. Individuals tend to occupy small home ranges of . The gray mouse lemur is also sympatric with the reddish-gray mouse lemur, golden-brown mouse lemur, Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur, and several other cheirogaleid lemurs. In Ankarafantsika National Park, where it coexists with the golden-brown mouse lemur, the gray mouse lemur&#x27;s relative population density was highest at higher altitudes and in drier habitat, while the golden-brown mouse lemur preferred the opposite. Another study has looked at the coexistence of the gray mouse lemur and Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur and found small, exclusive clusters of each species and a high degree of feeding niche overlap.

The gray mouse lemur can reach high population densities up to several hundred individuals per square kilometer (up to 167 individuals/km2 at Ankarafantsika National Park to 712 individuals/km2 at Kirindy Mitea National Park). This abundance is not uniform and tends to concentrate in &quot;population nuclei&quot;, suggesting that it is difficult to accurately estimate population densities when extrapolating from a small area (from various studies) to a large area. The difficulty in finding individuals during some times of the year, particularly during the dry periods, can further complicate the problem of estimating population densities.

Mouse lemurs are omnivorous, and favor fruit and insects for the bulk of their diet. The gray mouse lemur may even come down to the ground to catch insect prey, though it quickly returns to the protective cover of the understory to consume its catch. Nectar is also a part of the gray mouse lemur&#x27;s diet, making it a potential pollinator for local plant species. A single instance of a male cannibalizing an adult female is known.

===Predation===

The most significant predators of the gray mouse lemur are the Madagascar owl and barn owl. Studies conducted in Beza Mahafaly Reserve and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate a predation rate of around 25% (percent population taken by predators per year), the highest known for any primate species. However, given the species&#x27; high reproductive potential, predation does not appear to have a drastic effect on its populations. Other raptors, such as Henst&#x27;s goshawk and other owls, also prey upon this species. Snakes, such as &quot;Ithycyphus miniatus&quot; (a native colubrid snake) and the Madagascar tree boa, as well as mammalian predators, such as the ring-tailed mongoose, narrow-striped mongoose, fossa, and domestic dogs are also known to prey on the gray mouse lemur. Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests, and enlarge the opening so they can catch and eat the occupant. This puts strong selective pressure on the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.

Due to its non-gregarious nature, the gray mouse lemur, like other nocturnal lemurs, primarily defends itself from predators using avoidance strategies, although group defense through the use of alarm calls and predator mobbing has been observed in this species. Studies involving the placement of predator and non-predator fecal odor with captive populations have demonstrated a genetic predisposition for predator recognition through the detection of metabolites from meat digestion. The mouse lemurs were shown to avoid locations where they typically received rewards, as well as exhibit increased activity and anti-predator behavior, when the odor of predator feces were present in that vicinity, but not when the fecal odor of Malagasy non-predators was present.

During the day, when they are most vulnerable, individuals shelter inside tree holes, sometimes forming nests. They may use three to nine different tree holes within their home range, yet individuals may use one particular hole for up to five consecutive days. Mouse lemurs tend to prefer tree hollows, but also commonly make spherical constructions out of leaves. Nests are usually found in tree holes with a minimum diameter of , with a median of , suggesting that this range in diameter of tree holes may be crucial for maintaining a healthy habitat. The gray mouse lemur also spends most of its time in dense vegetation, limiting its visibility and accessibility to predators. Furthermore, it has a high reproductive rate to counter losses to predation.

==Behavior==
The gray mouse lemur is nocturnal, sleeping during the day in tree holes lined with leaf litter or purpose-built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves, moss and twigs. It usually forages alone at night, but may sleep in groups during the day, the composition of which depends on gender and season. Tree holes can be shared with up to 15 other individuals, although males tend to sleep alone while females tend to share nests.

All mouse lemurs are highly active at night, often scurrying like mice and leaping over , using the tail as a balancing organ. When moving among the terminal branches of bushes and trees, they grip using all four feet and move with four legs. When on the ground, either to catch insects or cross short open areas, mouse lemurs hop like a frog. When hunting, the grey mouse lemur is known to catch invertebrates and small vertebrates with quick hand grasps.

In the dry season, the gray mouse lemur faces the challenge of exploiting sparsely distributed feeding resources efficiently. Results of a recent study on this showed that the gray mouse lemur does not move around randomly, but rather use spatial cues to find food resources in the absence of sensory cues, and that they seem to reuse common, highly efficient routes with regard to travel distance. It is believed that rather than using a route-based network, the gray mouse lemur has some sense of mental representation of their spatial environment, which they use to find and exploit food resources.

Foraging behavior is often slow, with height and direction changing continuously. Predation of insects occurs primarily on the ground. Before descending, the ear pinnae move alternately to help pinpoint the precise location of their prey. Insects are captured during a rapid dash across the leaf litter and are transported by mouth up into the relative safety of the branches. Studies with captive gray mouse lemurs have shown that vision is primarily used for prey detection, although the other senses certainly play a role in foraging.

The gray mouse lemur is omnivorous, feeding primarily on fruit and invertebrates. Local populations appear to specialize on locally available fruit. At both Marosalaza and Mandena, beetles are the primary insect prey, although moths, praying mantids, fulgorid bugs, crickets, cockroaches, and spiders are also eaten. Less than half the diet consists of insects, with fruit making up a slightly larger fraction. This lemur also consumes flowers, gums and nectar from &quot;Euphorbia&quot; and &quot;Terminalia&quot; trees, leaves (&quot;Uapaca&quot; sp.), exudates (Homopteran larvae secretions), and small vertebrates such as tree frogs, geckos, and chameleons. Its diet is seasonally varied and diverse in content, giving it a very broad feeding niche compared to other species such as the Madame Berthe&#x27;s mouse lemur. Therefore, it is affected more by food availability than by niche partitioning where sympatry occurs.

===Dormancy===
As with all members of the mouse lemur genus, the gray mouse lemur is known to enter short states of daily torpor, particularly during the cool, dry Southern Hemisphere winter. This rare trait in primates, coupled with the ease of observing the species within its wide geographic distribution and its good representation in captivity, makes it a popular subject for research as a model organism.

The gray mouse lemur is unique among the mouse lemurs studied so far because it is the only species to exhibit prolonged seasonal torpor, but this behavior has only been observed to occur in one locality. Activity patterns can differ noticeably between sexes as well as populations. At the Ampijoroa Forestry Station in Ankarafantsika National Park, males and females exhibit daily, rather than seasonal torpor. At Kirindy Forest, both sexes share the same daily torpor, yet during the dry season (April/May through September/October), females become completely inactive for several weeks or up to five months to conserve energy and reduce predation. However, males rarely remain inactive for more than a few days and become extremely active before the females revive from torpor, allowing them to establish hierarchies and territories for the breeding season. The use of alternative energy-saving strategies under the same environmental conditions was observed directly in 2008, providing the first physiological confirmation from the field. This pattern of seasonal versus daily torpor may relate to the seasonality of the region, since Kirindy is the only location west of the eastern mountain rainforests that experiences very low temperatures at night during the winter months. By entering extended torpor, sometimes referred to as hibernation, this would reduce the thermoregulatory stress in females, whereas males remain more active in preparation for the upcoming mating season. No difference in mortality has been shown between hibernating females and active males.

During torpor, the gray mouse lemur&#x27;s metabolic rate slows and its body temperature drops to the ambient temperature, as low as . During the cooler months of May though August, the species selects tree holes closer to ground level, where ambient temperatures remain more stable. This allows them to remain in torpor longer, and to conserve metabolic resources. One study showed that during the breeding season, both males and females reduced their energy expenditure by 20% when they nested in pairs, and a maximal energetic benefit of 40% was achieved when three mouse lemurs nested together. Even during the nonbreeding season, maximal energetic gain was observed two or more animals nested together, because resting metabolic rate was already decreased.

While the gray mouse lemur is found in both primary and secondary deciduous forests, they have lower population densities in secondary forests. This is because variations in gray mouse lemur abundance are linked to their capacity to enter torpor during the dry season, especially for females, which tend to hibernate longer than males. In primary forests, they can maintain daily torpor or hibernation as long as their body temperatures remain below , but in secondary forests that have fewer large trees, temperatures are higher and inhibit the gray mouse lemur&#x27;s ability to maintain torpor for prolonged periods of time. In addition, the gray mouse lemur in secondary forests tend to have a lower body mass than those in primary forests, as well as lower survival rates. This is likely because those with lower body mass are less likely to enter torpor, and therefore expend around 40% more energy than those that do maintain torpor.

This unusual ability for a primate to exhibit dormancy, in addition to the diminutive size, has led researchers to speculate that ancestral lemurs, and possibly ancestral primates, may have shared some traits with mouse lemurs. Consequently, the gray mouse lemur has once again been used as a model organism for studying lemur and primate evolution. For example, lemurs are thought to have colonized Madagascar by rafting to the island around 60 million years ago according to molecular phylogenetic studies. Before the discovery that ocean currents were the opposite of what they are today, thus favoring such an event, it was thought that it would have taken too long for any animal not capable of entering a state of dormancy to survive the trip. Therefore, the mouse lemurs, such as the gray mouse lemur, were thought to have shared this plesiomorphic (ancestral) trait with the ancestral lemurs.

===Social systems===
The gray mouse lemur is described as solitary but social, foraging alone at night, but frequently sleeping in groups during the day. This social pattern varies by gender, season, and location. Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring, whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season. Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable, consisting of two to nine individuals, although a male may be found with a group of females outside the breeding season. During the breeding season (September through October), males and females may sleep in the same tree hole. Mixed sex groups can be common at this time, with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males.

Research has shown that home ranges for the gray mouse lemur are usually small, possibly less than . Males typically travel further at night and have home ranges that are twice as large as those of females, often overlapping with one another, and always overlapping with at least one female&#x27;s home range. Male home ranges increase threefold during the breeding season.

Female home ranges overlap less than those of males, although localized concentrations, or &quot;population nuclei&quot;, tend to form in some areas, where the sex ratio favors females to males by three or four to one at the nucleus core. Genetic studies indicate that females arrange themselves spatially in clusters (&quot;population nuclei&quot;) of related individuals, while males tend to emigrate from their natal group. Research has shown that females in this species may maintain smaller ranges and associate more closely with other females than in some other mouse lemur species due to a more opportunistic feeding niche and, in the case of populations at Kirindy, the use of extended, seasonal torpor.

===Communication===

Vocalizations and scent are the primarily modes of communication within this species. Home ranges are scent marked with urine and feces. Vocalizations are complex and very high-pitched (ranging from 10 to 36 kHz), sometimes beyond the range of human hearing (0.02 to 20 kHz). These include calls for seeking contact, mating, distant communication, alarm, and distress.

Like other mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur uses what has been described as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls are more common and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls are more common in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.

As with other social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and identity of the individual. Dialects have also been detected between communities. The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is much like a bird song in terms of its ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 and 35 kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9 seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute. Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme. These calls are not genetically programmed. During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call, which show high degrees of variability. Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors, when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood. This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.

Because mouse lemurs are cryptic species, and therefore visually indistinguishable, their social calls help individuals select mates of their own species. This differentiated signaling and recognition system has promoted species cohesiveness through premating isolation, and helped researchers distinguish and identify species.

===Breeding and reproduction===
The mating system is described as multi-male and multi-female. Males establish dominance hierarchies prior to the mating season, however, some studies in the wild have shown no male aggression or visible competition for receptive females. Males in captivity become highly aggressive and form strict dominance hierarchies. These captive males may show the highest plasma testosterone levels found in mammals, and even the odor of a dominant male can lower the testosterone levels and sexually inhibit a subordinate male. During the breeding season, male testes increase significantly in size, facilitating sperm competition due to female promiscuity. Studies with the gray mouse lemur have shown that the optimal insemination period, during which a male is most likely to sire offspring, occurs early during a female&#x27;s receptivity. Only during the mating season does male mortality rise above that of female mortality.

Although the gray mouse lemur displays multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, studies have shown that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger and heavier individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.

The gray mouse lemur is considered overall sexually monomorphic, but seasonally fluctuating sexual dimorphism in terms of body mass has been recorded. While the body mass of both sexes fluctuates over the year as a function of food availability, being highest in the rainy season, the differing behavioral repertoires of the sexes lead to sex-specific patterns in this fluctuation. For example, male body mass increases prior to the mating season due to a substantial increase in testes volume that likely enhances the males&#x27; success in sperm competition.

The females are receptive for 45 to 55 days between September and October, with estrus lasting 1 to 5 days. Females advertise estrus by distinctive high-frequency calls and scent-marking. Gestation lasts 54 to 68 days, averaging 60 days, typically resulting in 2 or 3 offspring weighing each. Infants are born in a leaf nest or tree hole in November prior to the onset of the rainy season. Weaning occurs after 25 days, and the infants are either left in the nest or carried in the mother&#x27;s mouth and deposited on a branch while she forages. Infant mouse lemurs do not cling to the mother&#x27;s fur. Independence is attained in 2 months, while sexual maturity is reached at 10 to 29 months in females and 7 to 19 months in males. Closely related females remain loosely associated after maturation (female philopatry), whereas males disperse from their natal area. In the wild, the gray mouse lemur&#x27;s reproductive lifespan is no more than 5 years, although captive specimens have reportedly lived as long as 15 years and 5 months, or even as long as 18.2 years.

The gray mouse lemur uses cooperative breeding as a form of family insurance. The female regularly transfers her offspring to other females&#x27; nests—and likewise grooms and cares for offspring other than her own. While this can have a high physiological cost on a lactating female that is already expending a lot of energy, it can be beneficial overall to insuring survival among closely related groups with high mortality risk. A study that took place over three breeding seasons showed that closely related females form breeding groups mainly when there is a shortage of suitable roosts; when there is an advantage of a communal nest for defense, or when there are thermoregulatory benefits. In the event of offspring adoption, when a parent dies and a closely related female takes over care, it is believed that this is beneficial to groups with high mortality risk.

==Conservation status==
The gray mouse lemur was listed in Appendix 1 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1975, declaring it as threatened with extinction and prohibiting international trade of specimens except for non-commercial use, such as scientific research. The 2008 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessment lists it as a species of least concern (LC) with a decreasing population trend.

Its greatest threats are habitat loss from slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle-grazing, as well as live capture for the local pet trade in the northern and southern parts of its range. Although this species inhabits secondary forests, studies have shown that decreased habitat quality adversely affects its populations since fewer tree holes offer fewer opportunities to conserve energy, increasing stress and mortality. One study found nine species of parasites in the fecal matter of the gray mouse lemur living in forests that suffered degradation and fragmentation. In small fragments of good quality forest, as well as forests with high levels of degradation, the gray mouse lemur showed a higher prevalence of parasitic nematodes and protozoans than those in larger good quality forest fragments. Studies in the late 1960s and 1970s showed that heavy logging between 1968 and 1970 seemed to result in decreased body weight, the use of smaller trees for nesting sites, and a smaller maximum female nesting group size (down to 7 from 15). There is also a concern that although daily torpor can help conserve energy and resources during moderate food shortages, extended food shortages brought about by climate change could create too much stress and severely impact the survivability of the species.

The gray mouse lemur is considered one of Madagascar&#x27;s most abundant small native mammals, found in seven national parks, five special reserves, the Berenty Private Reserve, and other privately protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone.

This species of mouse lemur breeds very well in captivity, although it is not commonly displayed in zoos like some larger, diurnal lemurs. In 1989, more than 370 individuals were housed by 14 International Species Information System (ISIS) and non-ISIS institutions across the United States and Europe, 97% of which were captive born. In March 2009, 167 were registered at 29 ISIS institutions, including the Duke Lemur Center.

<text>A naveta is a form of megalithic chamber tomb unique to the Balearic island of Menorca. They date to the early Bronze Age.
They have two vertical and two corbelled walls giving them the form of an upturned boat, from which the navetas take their name.

The largest example is the Naveta d&#x27;Es Tudons which is around 4m high, 14m long and 6.4m wide.

The first author who wrote about these structures was Juan Ramis in his book &quot;Celtic antiquities on the island of Menorca&quot;, which was edited in 1818, it being the first book in the Spanish language entirely devoted to prehistory.

<doc id="663703" wikidata="Q257275" url="?curid=663703" title="Namazu">
<text>In Japanese mythology, the or is a giant underground catfish who causes earthquakes.

The creature lives under the islands of Japan and is guarded by the god Takemikazuchi enshrined at Kashima, who restrains the catfish with a stone. When the Kashima-god lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.

== Myth ==

The legend or myth in Japan is that a gigantic &quot;namazu&quot; (catfish) lives inside or beneath the earth (or in the mud) which causes earthquakes.

The association of the &quot;namazu&quot; with earthquake seems to have first occurred in the area around Lake Biwa, around the 16th century. The &quot;namazu&quot; had been depicted in the &quot;Ōtsu-e&quot; (&quot;pictures from the city of Otsu&quot;) which were manufactured in that area.

This earthquake-causing creature became associated with the deity and &quot;foundation stone&quot; in Kashima, Ibaraki. According to myth, the god Takemikazuchi enshrined at Kashima restrains the catfish underneath a stone (, &quot;kaname-ishi&quot;, perhaps &quot;foundation stone&quot; but maybe more aptly &quot;cap stone&quot;). When the Kashima-god lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.

===Explanation===
Widespread connections between catfish and earthquakes in Japan were not present until the late 17th century, and only rose to popularity as symbolically causing or predicting earthquakes during the 19th century. Prior to the 1855 Edo earthquake, an eel fisherman reportedly spotted unusually active catfish in a river, which he took as a predictor of an earthquake. Later that night, the earthquake struck. The anecdote, recorded in an 1856 chronicle of journalistic reporting on the earthquake, is the earliest known claim that catfish can naturally predict earthquakes. In the 1930s, Japanese seismologists Shinkishi Hatai and Noboru Abe demonstrated that catfish in aquaria showed increased agitation several hours before earthquakes occurred, and were able to predict quakes with 80% accuracy.

== History ==
=== Namazu-e ===
 were a known item in the 19th century, and these broadsides were printed in great quantity following the 1855 earthquake near Edo (modern day Tokyo), one of the Ansei great earthquakes.

These &quot;namazu-e&quot; woodblock-prints encompass a large variety of scenes, typically depicting the god subduing the earthquake-causing catfish under a sword or the &quot;kanameishi&quot; stone. The creature is sometimes referred to as just the &quot;earthquake fish&quot; (&quot;jishin-no-uo&quot;), and despite the text calling it a catfish, the illustration may be that of a dragon-serpent.

Even though the Namazu was held responsible for the disaster, it was also ironically hailed as a &quot;yonaoshi daimyōjin&quot; (god of &quot;world rectification&quot;), that is to say, a sort of an &quot;avenger of social injustice&quot; which expressed the public&#x27;s political sentiment at the time. The rich had hoarded their wealth but these were largely disgorged due to the earthquake, and redistributed to the world at large: such is the symbolism of the large gold coins (&quot;koban&quot;, etc.) scattered by the earthquake depicted in the pictures. A large amount of money went into the rebuilding effort, and the job opportunities resulted in a redistribution of wealth.
One picture is printed with a jingle with the refrain &quot;yo-naoshi, yo-naoshi, tate-naoshi&quot; (literally &quot;world-fixing, world-fixing, re-building&quot;, which explicitly makes this connection.

==Modern use==

*Catfish are depicted on pictures of emergency earthquake preparedness activities in Japan. For example, the Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) logo by the Japan Meteorological Agency utilizes pictures of the catfish on devices capable of issuing an early warning. The popular earthquake early warning mobile application Yurekuru Call also has a catfish as their icon.
*Namazu is also the name of a song on Danish singer Oh Land&#x27;s first studio album &quot;Fauna&quot;, which features a large catfish on the album cover.
*In the Japanese version of &quot;Secret of Mana&quot;, the Earth Slide (Earthquake in the Japanese version) spell is a catfish icon in the ring menu.
*In &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, a catfish gives Link the Quake Medallion.
*A giant catfish mimicking Namazu&#x27;s habits appears as a boss figure in the video game &quot;Lufia II&quot;.
*The Pokémon Whiscash, named &quot;Namazun&quot; in Japan, resembles a catfish and has &quot;earthquake&quot; as its signature move. An episode of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime featuring Whiscash was scheduled to air on November 4, 2004, but was skipped over after the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake.
*The Namazu was featured in the episode of &quot;River Monsters&quot;, &quot;Cold-Blooded Horror&quot;.
*Namazu appears in a crossover comic book featuring Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot; and IDW&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;.
*The Namazu are a Tribal race that resembles bipedal catfish in &quot;Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood&quot;.
*In S1:E7 of &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, the character Zoonama appears as a giant catfish that wiggles his whiskers when detecting earthquakes, and repeats the word &quot;Namazu&quot; in his speech.
*The myth of Namazu is briefly mentioned by the character Kenjaku in Chapter 133 of the manga Jujutsu Kaisen.
*The myth of Namazu and a scroll of namazu-e is referenced throughout the 2022 Japanese animated fantasy film of Makoto Shinkai, &quot;Suzume&quot;.
