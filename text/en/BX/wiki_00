<text>Web standards are the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe aspects of the World Wide Web. In recent years, the term has been more frequently associated with the trend of endorsing a set of standardized best practices for building web sites, and a philosophy of web design and development that includes those methods.

==Overview==
Web standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the Internet, not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and web services. Considerations include the interoperability, accessibility and usability of web pages and web sites.

Web standards consist of the following:
* Recommendations published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), such as HTML/XHTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), image formats such as Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), as well as accessibility technologies like WAI-ARIA
* Standards and &quot;Living standards&quot; published by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), such as the HTML Living Standard, DOM Standard, Encoding Standard and URL Standard.
* Standards published by Ecma International (formerly ECMA) such as JavaScript (also known as &quot;ECMAScript&quot;) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) 
* Standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), such as JPEG

More broadly, the following technologies may be referred to as &quot;web standards&quot; as well:

* Request for Comments (RFC) documents published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
* The Unicode Standard and various Unicode Technical Reports (UTRs) published by the Unicode Consortium
* Name and number registries maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

Web standards are evolving specifications of web technologies. Web standards are developed by standards organizations—groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization—not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in case of W3C specifications, the highest maturity level).

==The web standards movement==
The earliest visible manifestation of the web standards movement was the Web Standards Project, launched in August 1998 as a grassroots coalition fighting for improved web standards support in browsers.

The web standards movement supports concepts of standards-based web design, including the separation of document structure from a web page or application&#x27;s appearance and behavior; an emphasis on semantically structured content that validates (that is, contains no errors of structural composition) when tested against validation software maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium; and progressive enhancement, a layered approach to web page and application creation that enables all people and devices to access the content and functionality of a page, regardless of personal physical ability (accessibility), connection speed, and browser capability.

Prior to the web standards movement, many web page developers used invalid, incorrect HTML syntax such as &quot;table layouts&quot; and &quot;spacer&quot; GIF images to create web pages — an approach often referred to as &quot;tag soup&quot;. Such pages sought to look the same in all browsers of a certain age (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and Netscape Navigator 4), but were often inaccessible to people with disabilities. Tag soup pages also displayed or operated incorrectly in older browsers, and required code forks such as JavaScript for Netscape Navigator and JScript for Internet Explorer that added to the cost and complexity of development. The extra code required, and the lack of a caching page layout language, made web sites &quot;heavy&quot; in terms of bandwidth, as did the frequent use of images as text. These bandwidth requirements were burdensome to users in developing countries, rural areas, and wherever fast Internet connections were unavailable.

The Web Standards movement pioneered by Glenn Davis, George Olsen, Jeffrey Zeldman, Steven Champeon, Todd Fahrner, Eric A. Meyer, Tantek Çelik, Dori Smith, Tim Bray, Jeffrey Veen, and other members of the Web Standards Project replaced bandwidth-heavy tag soup with light, semantic markup and progressive enhancement, with the goal of making web content &quot;accessible to all&quot;.

The Web Standards movement declared that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were more than simply interesting technologies. &quot;They are a way of creating Web pages that will facilitate the twin goals of sophisticated and appropriate presentation and widespread accessibility.&quot; The group succeeded in persuading Netscape, Microsoft, and other browser makers to support these standards in their browsers. It then set about promoting these standards to designers, who were still using tag soup, Adobe Flash, and other proprietary technologies to create web pages.

In 2007, Douglas Vos initiated the Blue Beanie Day, inspired by Jeffrey Zeldman, who is shown with a blue cap on the book cover of his 2003 book &quot;Designing with Web Standards&quot;. Since then, the 30 November is the annual international celebration of web standards and web accessibility.

== Common usage ==
When a web site or web page is described as complying with web standards, it usually means that the site or page has valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML should also meet accessibility and semantic guidelines. Full standard compliance also covers proper settings for character encoding, valid RSS or valid Atom news feed, valid RDF, valid metadata, valid XML, valid object embedding, valid script embedding, browser- and resolution-independent codes, and proper server settings.

When web standards are discussed, the following publications are typically seen as foundational:
* Recommendations for markup languages, such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) from W3C.
* Recommendations for stylesheets, especially Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), from W3C.
* Standards for ECMAScript, more commonly JavaScript, from Ecma International.
* Recommendations for Document Object Models (DOM), from W3C.
* Properly formed names and addresses for the page and all other resources referenced from it (URIs), based upon RFC 2396, from IETF.
* Proper use of HTTP and MIME to deliver the page, return data from it and to request other resources referenced in it, based on RFC 2616, from IETF.

Web accessibility is normally based upon the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the W3C&#x27;s Web Accessibility Initiative.

Work in the W3C toward the Semantic Web is currently focused by publications related to the Resource Description Framework (RDF), Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages (GRDDL) and Web Ontology Language (OWL).

== Standards publications and bodies ==
A W3C Recommendation is a specification or set of guidelines that, after extensive consensus-building, has received the endorsement of W3C Members and the Director.

An IETF Internet Standard is characterized by a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community. A specification that reaches the status of Standard is assigned a number in the IETF STD series while retaining its original IETF RFC number.

== Non-standard and vendor-proprietary pressures ==
HTML 5 contains numerous &quot;willful violations&quot; of other specifications, in order to accommodate limitations of existing platforms.

==Web Standards Compliance Testing==
There are compliance tests both for HTML code generated by websites as well as for the faithful interpretation of HTML code by web browsers.

===Compliance tests for website code===
W3C offers online services to test websites directly for both web site developers, as well as for website users. These include:
* Markup Validation Service to check the markup (HTML, XHTML, ...) of Web documents
* CSS Validation Service to check Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and (X)HTML documents with style sheets

===Compliance tests for web browsers===
The Web Standards Project (WaSP), although development is officially &quot;inactive&quot;, continues to offer two levels of testing services for web browsers:
* Acid2 Browser Test
* Acid3 Browser Test

<doc id="659627" wikidata="Q358455" url="?curid=659627" title="Martin H. Glynn">
<text>Martin Henry Glynn (September 27, 1871 – December 14, 1924) was an American politician. He was the 40th governor of New York from 1913 to 1914, the first Irish American Roman Catholic head of government of what was then the most populated state of the United States. A Democrat, he signed a number of important reforms, including the direct primary and labor laws.

== Life ==
Glynn was born in Kinderhook, New York and grew up in Valatie, one of Kinderhook&#x27;s villages. He was the son of Martin Glynn (son of Martin Glynn and Catherine de Burke) and Ann Scanlon, who were both born in Ireland.

He graduated from Fordham University in 1894, then studied at Albany Law School of Union University, New York, and was admitted to the bar in 1897. From 1896 on, he wrote for the &quot;Albany Times-Union&quot; daily newspaper, becoming eventually its editor, publisher and owner. In 1898, Fordham awarded Glynn the honorary degree of Master of Arts. Over the course of his career, Glynn received honorary LL.D. degrees from Fordham, Syracuse, Georgetown, and Union Universities.
Glynn was elected as a Democrat to the 56th United States Congress, and served from March 4, 1899, to March 3, 1901. When he took his seat at age 26, Glynn was the youngest member of the House. He was New York State Comptroller from 1907 to 1908, elected in 1906, but defeated for re-election in 1908 by Republican Charles H. Gaus.

At the New York state election of 1912, Glynn was the running mate of the successful Democratic candidate for Governor, William Sulzer. Glynn was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor of New York on January 1. Following friction with the dominant Tammany Hall faction, Sulzer was impeached and in August 1913, Glynn was appointed Acting Governor. On October 17, following Sulzer&#x27;s formal removal from office, Glynn was sworn in as Governor. He was the first Catholic Governor of New York and showed an interest in Irish-American affairs. However, Glynn was forced to manage conflict in his own party between Tammany Hall and reformers/progressives led by Sulzer, who became a critic of Glynn&#x27;s administration. After a year in office Glynn was defeated at the 1914 election, by the Republican candidate, Charles S. Whitman. Sulzer was later active in the Progressive Party. Glynn was active in the progressive movement. David Sarasohn calls him &quot;an able and progressive governor&quot; who signed numerous reforms.
Glynn was a delegate to the 1916 and 1924 Democratic National Conventions. As the keynote speaker at the 1916 National Democratic Convention, Glynn delivered one of his most famous speeches, praising the accomplishments of President Woodrow Wilson and the platform of the Democratic Party.

== &quot;The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!&quot; ==
Glynn&#x27;s article &quot;The Crucifixion of Jews Must Stop!&quot; was published in the October 31, 1919, issue of &quot;The American Hebrew&quot;; in it he lamented the poor conditions for European Jews after World War I. Glynn referred to these conditions as a potential &quot;&quot; and asserted that &quot;six million Jewish men and women are starving across the seas&quot;. The figure of six million, which is also the generally accepted number of Jews who perished in The Holocaust of World War II has been exploited by Holocaust deniers. However, historian Robert N. Proctor says it &quot;is simply a remarkable coincidence and nothing more.&quot;

=== Death and burial ===
He committed suicide by gunshot in 1924, after having suffered throughout his adult life from chronic back pain caused by a spinal injury. Though the cause of death was listed on his death certificate, the local media reported that Glynn died of heart trouble. The true story of his death was publicized in Dominick Lizzi&#x27;s 1994 biography. He was buried at St. Agnes Cemetery in Menands, New York.

<text>Oswald Tschirtner (1920 in Perchtoldsdorf, Lower Austria – 20 May 2007) was an artist from Austria who had schizophrenia. He was known by the &quot;pseudonym&quot; of O.T.

== Life ==
Oswald Tschirtner was raised by an aunt and uncle in Vienna, and being very religious, attended a seminary school from the age of ten. He intended to become a priest, but was drafted into the German army in 1937. He fought at Stalingrad, and subsequently spent time in a prison camp in southern France. After the war, he was stricken by periods of religious fervor and violent episodes, and was sent to a psychiatric institute in 1947.

In 1957, he was sent to the Klosterneuburg Hospital near Vienna, and it was there that he began to draw, albeit reluctantly, under the supervision of Leo Navratil and other hospital staff. He displayed a unique approach to his works through his selective use of line and detail. His figures, particularly in his drawings from the 1980s onwards, are extremely reductive, and he arrives at the essential essence of portrayal through the conveyance of a minimal amount of visual detail. 

Tschirtner lived at the Haus der Künstler (House of Artists) since its opening in 1981. Located on the grounds of the Klosterneuburg Hospital in Maria-Gugging, Austria, this is a domicile where patients who show significant artistic talent live very independently and focus on their creative work.

<text>Ezekiel Cheever (1614–1708) was a schoolmaster, and the author of &quot;probably the earliest American school book&quot;, &quot;Accidence, A Short Introduction to the Latin Tongue&quot;. Upon his death, it was said that &quot;New England [had] never known a better teacher.&quot; He has been called &quot;the chief representative of the colonial schoolmaster&quot;.

==Biography==
Cheever came to Boston, Massachusetts in June 1637. Not much later, he went to New Haven, Connecticut and taught school. In 1650, Cheever moved the family back to Massachusetts. On December 29, 1670, he was invited to become Head Master of the Boston Latin School. He taught for seventy years, the last thirty-eight as master of the Boston Latin School. Cotton Mather gave the eulogy at his funeral. In it Mather praised Cheever for his &quot;untiring abjuration of the devil.&quot;

==Family==
In 1638, Cheever married Mary Culverwell, his first wife. She was the daughter of Ezekiel Culverwell, niece of Nathaniel Culverwell and cousin of William Gouge. Ezekiel and Mary had six children. Their daughter, Elizabeth, was grandmother of Ezekiel Goldthwait. Their son, Rev Samuel, graduated from Harvard in 1659. Mary died on January 20, 1649.

On November 18, 1652, Ezekiel married Ellen Lathrop who was the sister of Capt Thomas Lathrop, a casualty during King Philip&#x27;s War. Ezekiel and Ellen had five children. Their son, Rev Thomas, graduated from Harvard in 1677. Their son, Ezekiel Cheever, was a resident at Salem Village during the time of the Witch Trials.

Ezekiel was an ancestor of author John Cheever.

==Legacy==
* Ezekiel Cheever School was named in his honor.

<doc id="659632" wikidata="Q6801853" url="?curid=659632" title="McKenzie friend">
<text>A McKenzie friend assists a litigant in person in a court of law in Australia, Canada, England and Wales, Hong Kong, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, and New Zealand, by prompting, taking notes, and quietly giving advice. They need not be legally trained or have any professional legal qualifications.

The right to a McKenzie friend was established in the 1970 case of &quot;McKenzie v McKenzie&quot;. Although in many cases a McKenzie friend may be an actual friend, it is often somebody with knowledge of the area and the presumption is heavily in favour of admitting a McKenzie friend into court. He or she may be liable for any misleading advice given to the litigant in person but is not covered by professional indemnity insurance.

A similar, modified principle exists in Singapore. The role is distinct from that of a next friend or of an .

==Origin==
&quot;McKenzie v. McKenzie&quot; was a divorce case in England in 1969. Levine McKenzie, who was petitioning for divorce, had been legally aided but the legal aid had been withdrawn before the case went to court. Unable to fund legal representation, McKenzie had broken off contact with his solicitors, Jeffrey Gordon &amp; Co. However, one day before the hearing, Jeffrey Gordon sent the case to an Australian barrister in London, Ian Hanger, whose qualifications in law in Australia did not allow him to practise as a barrister in London. Hanger hoped to sit with his client to prompt him, take notes and suggest questions in cross-examination, thereby providing what quiet assistance he could from the bar table to a man representing himself. The trial judge ordered Hanger not to take any active part in the case (except to advise McKenzie during adjournments) and to sit in the public gallery of the court. Hanger assumed his limited role was futile and did not return for the second day of the trial.

The case went against McKenzie, who then appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that he had been denied representation. On 12 June 1970, the Court of Appeal ruled that the judge&#x27;s intervention had deprived McKenzie of the assistance to which he was entitled and ordered a retrial.

As of 2022, Ian Hanger AM KC, the original McKenzie friend, is a King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) at the Queensland Bar.

==In specific jurisdictions==
===Singapore===
In September 2006, the Subordinate Courts of Singapore started a pilot project called the Lay Assistant Scheme in which persons, usually with some legal knowledge, attend hearings with litigants who are not represented by lawyers to advise them on non-legal issues and help them with administrative tasks. The scheme, a modification of the UK&#x27;s McKenzie friend system, is intended to assist litigants who are not eligible for legal aid as they have an annual salary exceeding S$10,000 but cannot afford a lawyer. For the litigant to qualify, the other party must be legally represented.

Lay assistants are not allowed to act as lawyers and may not address the court; any breach of court rules may render them liable to a maximum fine of $1,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.

Plans for introducing McKenzie friends in court proceedings were first announced by Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong in May 2006. Students from the Pro Bono Group of the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore, have been participating in the scheme.

===England and Wales===
In English courts, where a case is being heard in private, the use of a McKenzie friend has sometimes been contentious. This is a particular problem in family court hearings, where it has been held that the nature of the case is so confidential that no one other than the litigants and their professional legal representatives should be admitted to the court.

A 2005 Court of Appeal case, &quot;In the matter of the children of Mr O&#x27;Connell, Mr Whelan and Mr Watson&quot;, clarified the law in this area. The result of the appeal has legitimised the use of McKenzie friends in the family court and allowed the litigant to disclose confidential court papers to the McKenzie friend.

England and Wales allow fee-charging McKenzie friends, who may charge for their services, including the giving of legal advice. A recent report by the Legal Service Consumer Panel found that fee charging McKenzie friends were a net benefit. The report stated, &quot;They should be viewed as providing valuable support that improves access to justice in the large majority of cases.&quot;

===Scotland===
The legal system in England and Wales differs from that in Scotland. The first recorded use of McKenzie friends in Scotland was in April 2007 in the case &quot;TB &amp; AM v The Authority Reporter&quot;. The one major difference between England and Scotland is that in Scotland McKenzie friends are not permitted to receive remuneration.

===Ireland===
Litigants in Ireland before The Court of Appeal and The High Court may obtain &quot;quiet advice&quot; from a lay person, but judges may refuse to permit such assistance where &quot;the interests of justice and fairness do not require the litigant to receive such assistance&quot;. Furthermore, the lay person may not receive payment for their assistance.

<text>Jacob Fredrik Ljunglöf (1796 – 1860) was a Swedish tobacco producer who took over a slow-going tobacco factory in Stockholm in 1826. The factory was put back to standard and the efficiency was increased. Until the late 1820s, it was the leading tobacco factory in Sweden. In 1839, Ljunglöf started producing cigars and cigarettes in addition to tobacco and chewing tobacco. When he died, Ljunglöf had become one of the richest men in Sweden.

<doc id="659641" wikidata="Q547833" url="?curid=659641" title="Septet">
<text>A septet is a formation containing exactly seven members. It is commonly associated with musical groups but can be applied to any situation where seven similar or related objects are considered a single unit, such as a seven-line stanza of poetry. 
== Classical and romantic period ==
One of the most famous classical septets is Beethoven&#x27;s Septet in E major, Op. 20, composed around 1799–1800, for clarinet, bassoon, horn, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. The popularity of Beethoven&#x27;s septet made its combination of instruments a standard for subsequent composers, including Conradin Kreutzer (Op. 62, 1822), Franz Berwald, and Adolphe Blanc (Op. 40, ca. 1864), and, with small changes in the instrumentation, Franz Lachner (1824; violin, viola, violoncello, contrabass, flute, clarinet, horn), and Max Bruch (1849; No Opus; Clarinet, Horn, Bassoon, two Violins, Cello and Contrabass). When Franz Schubert added a second violin in 1824 for his Octet, he created a standard octet that influenced many other subsequent composers . Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s Septet in E major, Op. 65 (1881) is for trumpet, piano, string quartet, and double bass. The English composer Percy Hilder Miles composed his &quot;Jupiter&quot; Septet in Eb (1897) for the same forces as the Beethoven.

== 20th century ==

The modern composer Bohuslav Martinů wrote three septets: a group of six dances called &quot;Les Rondes&quot; for oboe, clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, two violins, and piano (1930); a piece called Serenade No. 3 for oboe, clarinet, four violins, and cello (1932); and &quot;Fantasie&quot; for theremin, oboe, piano, and string quartet (1944). Darius Milhaud composed a string septet in 1964 for string sextet and double bass. Paul Hindemith composed a wind septet in 1948 for flute, oboe, clarinet, bass clarinet, bassoon, horn, and trumpet. Hanns Eisler composed two septets, both scored for flute, clarinet, bassoon, and string quartet: Septet No. 1 Op. 92a (&quot;Variations on American Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;) (1941), and Septet No. 2 (&quot;Circus&quot;) (1947), after Chaplin’s 1928 movie &quot;The Circus&quot;. Two component works in the series of &quot;Chôros&quot; by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos are scored for seven instruments: No. 3 (1925), subtitled &quot;Pica-páo&quot; (Woodpecker), is for clarinet, bassoon, saxophone, 3 horns, and trombone (or for male chorus, or for both together), and No. 7 (1924), actually subtitled &quot;Septet&quot;, is for flute, oboe, clarinet, saxophone, bassoon, violin, and cello (with tam-tam ad lib.).

There are some 20th-century works for seven instruments for which it is difficult to be certain that the term &quot;septet&quot; should be extended, if they are not obviously chamber music and may have titles pointing in other directions. Examples include Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot; (1905), Rudi Stephan&#x27;s &quot;Music for Seven String Instruments&quot; (1911), Leoš Janáček&#x27;s Concertino (1925), Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Suite, Op. 29 (1925–26), Isang Yun&#x27;s &quot;Music for Seven Instruments&quot; (1959), Aribert Reimann&#x27;s &quot;Reflexionen&quot; (1966), and Dieter Schnebel&#x27;s &quot;In motu proprio&quot; canon for seven instruments of the same kind (1975) . John Adams wrote his string septet, &quot;Shaker Loops&quot;, in 1978.

Jehan Alain composed the &quot;Messe modale en septuor&quot; in 1938 for seven parts, soprano, alto, flute and string quartet.

== Popular music ==
BTS, one of the most popular K-pop groups from Seoul, South Korea is an example of a septet.

<text>Patricia Mary W. Barker ( Drake; born 8 May 1943) is an English writer and novelist. She has won many awards for her fiction, which centres on themes of memory, trauma, survival and recovery. She is known for her Regeneration Trilogy, published in the 1990s, and, more recently, a series of books set during the Trojan War, starting with &quot;The Silence of the Girls&quot; in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Patricia Mary W. Drake was born on 8 May 1943 to a working-class family in Thornaby-on-Tees in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England. Her mother Moyra died in 2000; her father&#x27;s identity is unknown. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, Moyra became pregnant &quot;after a drunken night out while in the Wrens.&quot; In a social climate where illegitimacy was regarded with shame, she told people that the resulting child was her sister, rather than her daughter. They lived with Barker&#x27;s grandmother Alice and step-grandfather William, until her mother married and moved out when Barker was seven. Barker could have joined her mother, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, but chose to stay with her grandmother &quot;because of love of her, and because my stepfather didn&#x27;t warm to me, nor me to him.&quot; Her grandparents ran a fish and chip shop which failed and the family was, she told &quot;The Times&quot; in 2007, &quot;poor as church mice; we were living on National Assistance – &#x27;on the pancrack&#x27;, as my grandmother called it.&quot; 

At the age of eleven, Barker won a place at grammar school, attending King James Grammar School in Knaresborough and Grangefield Grammar School in Stockton-on-Tees.

Barker, who says she has always been an avid reader, studied international history at the London School of Economics from 1962-65. After graduating in 1965, she returned home to nurse her grandmother, who died in 1971.

==Career==
===Early work===
Barker has written many novels. In her mid-twenties, Barker began to write fiction. Her first three novels were never published and, she told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, &quot;didn&#x27;t deserve to be: I was being a sensitive lady novelist, which is not what I am. There&#x27;s an earthiness and bawdiness in my voice.”

Her first published novel was &quot;Union Street&quot; (1982), which consisted of seven interlinked stories about English working class women whose lives are circumscribed by poverty and violence. For ten years, the manuscript was rejected by publishers as too &quot;bleak and depressing.&quot; Barker met novelist Angela Carter at an Arvon Foundation writers&#x27; workshop. Carter liked the book, telling Barker &quot;if they can&#x27;t sympathise with the women you&#x27;re creating, then sod their fucking luck,&quot; and suggested she send the manuscript to feminist publisher Virago, which accepted it. The &quot;New Statesman&quot; hailed the novel as a &quot;long overdue working class masterpiece,&quot; and &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; commented Barker &quot;gives the sense of a writer who has enormous power that she has scarcely had to tap to write a first-rate first novel.&quot; &quot;Union Street&quot; was later adapted as the Hollywood film &quot;Stanley &amp; Iris&quot; (1990), starring Robert De Niro and Jane Fonda. Barker has said the film bears little resemblance to her book. As of 2003, the novel remained one of Virago&#x27;s top sellers.

Barker&#x27;s first three published novels – &quot;Union Street&quot; (1982), &quot;Blow Your House Down&quot; (1984) and &quot;Liza&#x27;s England&quot; (1986; originally published as &quot;The Century&#x27;s Daughter&quot;) – depicted the lives of working-class women in Yorkshire. &quot;BookForum&quot; magazine described them as &quot;full of feeling, violent and sordid, but never exploitative or sensationalistic and rarely sentimental.&quot; &quot;Blow Your House Down&quot; portrays prostitutes living in a North of England city, who are being stalked by a serial killer. &quot;Liza&#x27;s England&quot;, described by the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; as a &quot;modern-day masterpiece,&quot; tracks the life of a working-class woman born at the dawn of the 20th century.

===Regeneration Trilogy===
Following the publication of &quot;Liza&#x27;s England&quot;, Barker felt she &quot;had got myself into a box where I was strongly typecast as a northern, regional, working class, feminist—label, label, label—novelist. It&#x27;s not a matter so much of objecting to the labels, but you do get to a point where people are reading the labels instead of the book. And I felt I&#x27;d got to that point&quot;, she said in 1992. She said she was tired of reviewers asking &quot;&#x27;but uh, can she do men?&#x27; – as though that were some kind of Everest&quot;.

Therefore, she turned her attention to the First World War, which she had always wanted to write about due to her step-grandfather&#x27;s wartime experiences. Wounded by a bayonet and left with a scar, he would not speak about the war. She was inspired to write what is now known as the Regeneration Trilogy—&quot;Regeneration&quot; (1991), &quot;The Eye in the Door&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Ghost Road&quot; (1995)—a set of novels that explore the history of the First World War by focusing on the aftermath of trauma. The books are an unusual blend of history and fiction, and Barker draws extensively on the writings of First World War poets and W. H. R. Rivers, an army doctor who worked with traumatised soldiers. The main characters are based on historical figures, such as Robert Graves, Alice and Hettie Roper (pseudonyms for Alice Wheeldon and her daughter Hettie) with the exception of Billy Prior, whom Barker invented to parallel and contrast with British soldier-poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. As the central fictional character, Billy Prior is in all three books.

“I think the whole British psyche is suffering from the contradiction you see in Sassoon and Wilfred Owen, where the war is both terrible and never to be repeated and at the same time experiences derived from it are given enormous value,&quot; Barker told &quot;The Guardian.&quot; &quot;No one watches war films in quite the way the British do.&quot;

Barker told freelance journalist Wera Reusch &quot;I think there is a lot to be said for writing about history, because you can sometimes deal with contemporary dilemmas in a way people are more open to because it is presented in this unfamiliar guise, they don&#x27;t automatically know what they think about it, whereas if you are writing about a contemporary issue on the nose, sometimes all you do is activate people&#x27;s prejudices. I think the historical novel can be a backdoor into the present which is very valuable.&quot;

&quot;The Regeneration Trilogy&quot; was extremely well received by critics, with Peter Kemp of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; describing it as &quot;brilliant, intense and subtle&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; saying it was &quot;a triumph of an imagination at once poetic and practical.&quot; The trilogy is described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a fierce meditation on the horrors of war and its psychological aftermath.&quot; Novelist Jonathan Coe describes it as &quot;one of the few real masterpieces of late 20th century British fiction.&quot; British author and critic, Rosemary Dinnage reviewing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; declared that it has &quot;earned her a well-deserved place in literature&quot; resulting in its re-issue for the centenary of the First World War. In 1995 the final book in the trilogy, &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;, won the Booker–McConnell Prize.

==Critical appraisal==
Barker&#x27;s work is described as direct, blunt and plainspoken.

In 2012, &quot;The Observer&quot; named the Regeneration Trilogy as one of &quot;The 10 best historical novels&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1983, Barker won the Fawcett Society prize for fiction for &quot;Union Street&quot;. In 1993 she won the Guardian Fiction Prize for the &quot;Eye in the Door&quot;, and in 1995 she won the Booker Prize for &quot;The Ghost Road&quot;. In May 1997, Barker was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Open University. In 2000, she was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

In the review of her novel &quot;Toby&#x27;s Room&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated about her writing, &quot;You don&#x27;t go to her for fine language, you go to her for plain truths, a driving storyline and a clear eye, steadily facing the history of our world&quot;.

&quot;The Independent&quot; wrote of her, &quot;she is not only a fine chronicler of war but of human nature&quot;.

In 2019, Barker was shortlisted for the Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction for &quot;The Silence of the Girls&quot;. In their review of the novel, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Chilling, powerful, audacious . . . A searing twist on &quot;The Iliad&quot;. Amid the recent slew of rewritings of the great Greek myths and classics, Barker&#x27;s stands out for its forcefulness of purpose and earthy compassion&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated, &quot;This is an important, powerful, memorable book that invites us to look differently not only at &quot;The Iliad&quot; but at our own ways of telling stories about the past and the present, and at how anger and hatred play out in our societies.&quot;

In July 2024, Barker was elected as an honorary Fellow of the British Academy.

==Personal life==
In 1969, she was introduced, in a pub, to David Barker, a zoology professor and neurologist 20 years her senior, who left his marriage to live with her. They had two children together, and were married in 1978, after his divorce. Their daughter Anna Barker Ralph is a novelist. Barker was widowed when her husband died in January 2009.

<doc id="659663" wikidata="Q3390928" url="?curid=659663" title="Litigant in person">
<text>In England and Wales, a litigant in person is an individual, company or organisation that has rights of audience (this is, the right to address the court) and is not represented in a court of England and Wales by a solicitor or barrister. Instructing a barrister and not a solicitor, for example through the Public Access Scheme, however, does not prevent the party on whose behalf the barrister had been instructed from being a litigant in person.

It is possible nevertheless for litigants in England and Wales to obtain free legal advice and in some cases representation from the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB).

The term &quot;litigant in person&quot; is also used in the similar (but separate) legal systems of Irish law and Northern Irish law.

The equivalent in Scotland is a party litigant and in the United States is &quot;pro se&quot; legal representation.

==Civil defendant==
The defendants in the McLibel case (&quot;McDonald&#x27;s Corporation v Steel &amp; Morris&quot;, [1997] EWHC QB 366) represented themselves in person both at first instance and on appeal during a libel lawsuit which lasted nearly ten years.

==Criminal defendant==
A special category of &quot;litigant in person&quot; arises when a defendant in a criminal case dismisses their defence counsel and chooses to defend the case themselves. This is almost invariably an inadvisable course of action, since the law and procedure can be complex and the penalties if convicted can be severe. Furthermore, in some jurisdictions the &quot;litigant in person&quot; is restricted from cross-examining the alleged victim in rape and other serious sexual offences. The underlying policy is that an alleged victim should not have to answer directly to an alleged rapist. The right of the individual to defend themselves is in conflict with the need to protect the alleged victim from any further humiliation. In the UK this conflict is resolved by the court appointing a special counsel at public expense to conduct cross-examination.

High-profile cases in Scotland where the accused conducted his own defence and lost were Peter Manuel (who was hanged) and Tommy Sheridan.

==Appellant in person==
An appellant in person is someone who by their own choice, or because their former counsel is criticised and has withdrawn, is conducting their own appeal at a Crown Court or at the Court of Appeal Criminal Division. The number of appellants who choose to do this is exceptionally small, mainly due to the inherent risks involved, appellants who serve a custodial sentence can have part of that sentence ordered to be served again if the court is of the view that the application is without merit. They must also understand highly complex court procedures, prepare detailed legal paperwork and orally argue a full legal appeal case in front of three High Court judges and a full court.

==Representing companies==
In &quot;Battle v Irish Art Promotion Centre Ltd&quot;, the Supreme Court of Ireland ruled that a company cannot be represented by a corporate officer in lieu of a barrister or solicitor. The &quot;&quot;Battle&quot; rule&quot; has been slightly relaxed by later decisions.

<text>The Book of Skulls is a science fiction novel by American writer Robert Silverberg, first published in 1972. It was nominated for the Nebula Award in 1972, and both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1973.

== Synopsis ==
The plot concerns four college students who discover a Catalan manuscript, &quot;The Book of Skulls&quot;, dealing with an order of monks living in a monastery in the Arizona desert, whose members claim the power to bestow immortality on those who complete their bizarre initiation rite. Most morbid among the order&#x27;s mysteries is the ninth: for each group of four initiates, only two will become immortal; one will sacrifice himself; and one will be sacrificed by the others. The boys travel across America to the monastery, where they are accepted as a &quot;Receptacle&quot; and told that if one was to leave after swearing their life to the order, the three others would be forfeit.

The narrative switches back and forth between the viewpoints of the four students as each confronts his personal demons on the way to completing the ritual. Timothy, star athlete and prodigal son of a wealthy family, quickly grows disillusioned with austere monastic life. Ned, an openly gay poet, finds himself fascinated with the philosophical contrast between eternity and extinction. Eli, the gifted but awkward young man who discovered the manuscript, forces himself to divest the surety of the mundane for faith in the extraordinary. Oliver, the handsome over-motivated farm kid, works himself harder than ever out of a powerful lust for life. Their teachings include a history of immortality, alluding to prehistoric shamans and advanced Atlantean scholars.

One of the mentor monks puts them through a trial of confession: each student privately confessing their darkest moment to only one other. Ned confesses to Timothy about his gleeful role in a gay double affair, leading to a double suicide. Timothy confesses to Oliver about social belittlement and rejection leading to him drunkenly raping his sister. Oliver confesses to Eli about the day he was seduced into a homosexual fling as a teenager, and how he suppresses his desires. But on his turn Eli breaks confidentiality and tells Ned about Oliver&#x27;s confession — a convenient &quot;ad-hoc sin&quot;. Rejecting this, Ned forces Eli to give up his real guilt: his entire academic career is based on the brilliant but uncredited manuscript of a dead colleague.

Sent into a dissociative episode by the moment, Eli wanders the monastery throughout the night and begins to truly understand the spiritual components of the monks&#x27; teachings. As the sun rises, a disgusted Timothy attempts to convince Eli to leave one last time before walking back towards nearby Phoenix himself. Eli, knowing the consequences and feeling the time is at hand, bashes Timothy&#x27;s head in with a carved stone skull. Shortly after, Oliver, who was approached in the night by an aggressive Ned, is found dead and castrated by many self-inflicted knife wounds, unable to handle the reality of his sexual orientation. With one initiate dead by murder and one by suicide, the monks declare the ninth mystery fulfilled and welcome the remaining two into eternal life.

==Reception==
Baird Searles found the novel well-crafted but unsatisfying, saying of the viewpoint characters that &quot;none [were] particularly likeable, interesting, or convincing.&quot;

James Blish, despite finding the novel a &quot;noble failure,&quot; described it as &quot;so unobtrusively, flawlessly written that even at its most puzzling it comes as perilously close to poetic beauty as any of the contemporary novels I&#x27;ve ever read.&quot;

== Film adaptation ==
In 2003, Paramount Pictures optioned the film rights, with William Friedkin to direct and Jeff Davis adapting. No further development were made.

The cover of the 2006 paperback edition stated that the novel is &quot;Soon to be made into a major motion picture&quot;. While there has been speculation on various film-related websites, plans for production failed to materialize.

<doc id="659672" wikidata="Q752266" url="?curid=659672" title="Durham Castle">
<text>Durham Castle is a Norman castle in the city of Durham, England, which has been occupied since 1837 by University College, Durham after its previous role as the residence of the Bishops of Durham. Designated since 1986 as a cultural World Heritage Site in England, along with Durham Cathedral, the castle is open to the general public to visit, but only through guided tours, since it is in use as a working building and is home to over 100 students. The castle stands on top of a hill above the River Wear on Durham&#x27;s peninsula, opposite Durham Cathedral ().

==History==
===Early history===
Construction of the castle, of the motte and bailey design favoured by the Normans, began in 1072 under the orders of William the Conqueror, six years after the Norman conquest of England, and soon after the Normans first came to the North. The construction took place under the supervision of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria, until he rebelled against William and was executed in 1076. Stone for the new buildings was cut from the cliffs below the walls and moved up using winches.

The holder of the office of the bishop of Durham, Bishop Walcher at the time, was appointed by the king to exercise royal authority on his behalf, with the castle being his seat. Adding to his status by the purchase of the Earldom of Northumbria, Walcher began a line of prince-bishops which continued until the Bishops of Durham lost their temporal powers under the Durham (County Palatine) Act 1836. The prince-bishops were entitled to raise an army, levy taxes and mint their own coinage. The wide remit granted them by the English crown allowed them virtual autonomy to act as a defence both against Scottish incursions from the north, and internal rebellions.

Walcher continued the building of the castle, as a combination of bishops&#x27; palace and defensive stronghold. Inner and outer baileys and a keep were constructed. The earliest structures may have been of wood, but there is evidence of building in stone from the end of the 11th century. In May 1080, the castle was attacked and besieged for four days by rebels from Northumbria and Bishop Walcher was killed. 

In the 12th century, Bishop Pudsey (Hugh de Puiset) built the Norman archway and the Galilee of the cathedral. In 1177, King Henry II of England seized the castle after a disagreement with de Puiset. Other major alterations were made by Bishop Thomas Hatfield in the 1300s, including a rebuilding of the keep and enlargement of the keep mount.

The castle has a large Great Hall, originally called a Dining Hall, created by Bishop Antony Bek in the early 14th century; Bishop Hatfield added a wooden minstrels&#x27; gallery. The hall was modified and enlarged, then reduced, in size by subsequent bishops. Today, the Hall is high and over long.

===University College===
The Castle remained the bishop&#x27;s palace for the Bishop of Durham until Auckland Castle was made the bishops&#x27; residence in 1832; the current bishop still maintains offices at that castle, roughly ten miles to the south. Subsequently, Durham castle was donated to the University of Durham by Bishop William Van Mildert and would later become the college. The college did not occupy the castle until 1837, after the next Bishop, Edward Maltby, had completed renovations of the building.

The cathedral was targeted for a Baedeker Blitz or bombing raid by Germany but escaped because fog rolled in and blocked the pilots&#x27; view.

==Architecture and description==
===Chapels===
The Norman Chapel is the oldest accessible part of the castle built about 1078. Its architecture is Anglian in nature, possibly due to forced Anglian labour being used to build it. In the 15th century, its three windows were all but blocked up because of the expanded keep. It fell into disuse until 1841 when it was used as a corridor through which to access the keep. During the Second World War, it was used as a command and observation post for the Royal Air Force. The chapel was re-consecrated shortly after the war and is still used for weekly services by the college.

Tunstall&#x27;s Chapel, named after Cuthbert Tunstall, was built in the 16th century and is used for worship within the college. It was modified in the 17th century by Bishop Cosin.

==World Heritage status and historic listing designations==
Durham Castle is jointly designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site with Durham Cathedral, a short distance across Palace Green.

The UNESCO report provides specifics about the Castle&#x27;s important aspects: Within the Castle precinct are later buildings of the Durham Palatinate, reflecting the Prince-Bishops’ civic responsibilities and privileges. These include the Bishop’s Court (now a library), almshouses, and schools. Palace Green, a large open space connecting the various buildings of the site once provided the Prince Bishops with a venue for processions and gatherings befitting their status, and is now still a forum for public events.

Seventeen elements of the castle are listed, all at the highest Grade, I. These are: the keep, the north and west ranges, the entrance gatehouse, a bastion and twelve sections of the castle walls.

<doc id="659675" wikidata="Q52855" url="?curid=659675" title="Swedish Match">
<text>Swedish Match AB is a Swedish multinational tobacco company headquartered in Stockholm. The company manufactures snus, nicotine pouches, moist snuff, tobacco- and nicotine-free pouch products, chewing tobacco, chew bags, tobacco bits, cigars, matches, lighters, and other fire products with operations in Sweden, Denmark, the United States, the Dominican Republic, Brazil, the Netherlands, and the Philippines. The company&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 1868, and Ivar Kreuger. Swedish Match has played an important part in Sweden&#x27;s industrial development.

In May 2022, Philip Morris launched a takeover bid for Swedish Match. Despite some shareholder resistance, by late November 2022 Philip Morris had acquired over 90% ownership, allowing it to begin the compulsory purchase of remaining shares and de-list Swedish Match from the stock market.

==History==
The operations of Swedish Match originate from two companies: Svenska Tobaksmonopolet, a tobacco monopoly owned by the Swedish state and founded in 1915, and Svenska Tändsticks Aktiebolaget (STAB), a match manufacturing company founded in 1917 by Ivar Kreuger (also known as the ”Match King”) in connection with the acquisition of Jönköpings Tändsticksfabrik. In 1992, the tobacco and lights operations were joined in the Procordia Group. Two years later, they were merged into an independent company named Swedish Match, which became publicly listed in 1996.

During parts of its existence, most recently between 2010 and 2015, the company has been headquartered in the so-called Matchstick Palace, commissioned by Ivar Kreuger in the late 1920s.

=== Svenska Tändsticks AB (STAB) ===
In 1917, Ivar Kreuger founded Svenska Tändsticks Aktiebolaget (STAB) in Jönköping (also known as &quot;City of the matches&quot;). It was a merger between Aktiebolaget Förenade Tändsticksfabriker and Jönköpings &amp; Vulcans Tändsticksfabriksaktiebolag. By expanding through acquisition of government-created monopolies by lending money to the governments, and through mergers with for instance the British match company Bryant and May in 1927, it became the world&#x27;s largest match manufacturer. A year later, STAB was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In 1930, the company controlled 60 percent of the world&#x27;s match production and was the sole owner of match companies in 33 countries.

Following the death of Ivar Kreuger in 1932, the ownership structure in STAB changed and a number of factories were liquidated. During 1938, STAB&#x27;s share of the world&#x27;s matchmaking fell to 20 percent. When the match market declined sharply in the 1950s, STAB looked for new business ventures and acquired more than 50 companies between 1968 and 1976.

In 1980, Svenska Tändsticks AB changed its name to Swedish Match to create unity throughout the group. In 1988 the company was acquired by Stora AB and was sold two years later to Nederlight. After another two years, Procordia acquired Swedish Match.

=== AB Svenska Tobaksmonopolet ===

In 1915, the Swedish government founded AB Svenska Tobaksmonopolet and nationalized all Swedish tobacco production plants. The monopoly was introduced in order to give the government funds to finance the country&#x27;s military defense and a new national pension system.

During the 1960s, the monopoly on production, import and sale of tobacco was abolished in Sweden. Svenska Tobaksmonopolet was converted to a new state-owned company named Svenska Tobaks AB. In 1971, the ownership of the tobacco group was transferred to Statsföretag, the Swedish Sovereign Wealth Fund, which in 1984 was renamed Procordia.

As a result of the monopoly being abolished and in order to broaden the market, the Dutch cigar company Elisabeth Bas/La Paz (EBAS), the American tobacco manufacturer Pinkerton Tobacco Company (maker of Red Man, a chewing tobacco brand introduced in the U.S. in 1904) and the Dutch cigar producer Willem II were acquired between 1968 and 1989. In 1989, Procodia was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. Volvo acquired part of Procordia in 1990 and became the principal owner together with the Swedish government. To complement the tobacco business, Procordia, in 1992, acquired the match and lighter company Swedish Match from Nederlight.

=== Swedish Match AB ===
In 1992, the listed company Procordia acquired the match and lighter business named Swedish Match. The operations of Swedish Match were integrated with Procordia United Brands, one of Procordia&#x27;s business operations, and was renamed Swedish Match to take advantage of international name recognition. In 1994, Swedish Match functioned as an independent company and was later, in 1996, listed on the OMX Nordic Exchange Stockholm AB and on Nasdaq.

In 1999, the company sold its cigarette manufacturing to Austria Tabak but is still active as a distributor of cigarettes on the Swedish market. In the same year, Swedish Match expanded its cooperation with PT. Java Match Factory (Jamafac), the biggest safety matches manufacturer in Indonesia, to a joint venture agreement in order to strengthen its position within lights and matches in Southeast Asia. Jamafac was divested in 2005 and now has a license agreement with Swedish Match to produce matches and distribute Cricket Lighters in Indonesia.

In 2009, Swedish Match entered an agreement with Philip Morris International and formed the joint venture company SMPM International, with equal stakes owned by each of the two partners, for exploring and developing new markets for snus and other smokefree tobacco products outside Scandinavia and the United States. The collaboration placed test markets in Tel Aviv, Israel; St. Petersburg, Russia; Taiwan; and nationwide Canada. The joint venture was, however, dissolved in 2015.

In 2010, Swedish Match and Scandinavian Tobacco Group (STG) formed a new company specialized in cigars. Swedish Match brought its entire cigar business (with the exception of U.S. mass market cigars) and pipe tobacco into the new company, while STG transferred all of its tobacco business. The new company took over the name Scandinavian Tobacco Group. Swedish Match became a partner with 49 percent of the company, and the remaining shares were owned by Skandinavisk Holding A/S. In 2016, STG became publicly listed, and Swedish Match sold most of its shares in the company.

In 2017, Swedish Match acquired V2 Tobacco, a producer of chew bags and snus, and in 2018, Oliver Twist, a producer of tobacco bits. Both companies are Danish and now fully owned by Swedish Match. Also in 2018, Swedish Match bought a 95 percent stake in the Swedish company Gotlandssnus, which produces snus.

In 2022, Swedish Match&#x27;s shares hit record high as Philip Morris International (PMI) closed a $16 billion dollar deal with the company.
PMI completed the acquisition and eventually delisted Swedish Match.

==Operations==

Snus, moist snuff, cigars, chewing tobacco, chew bags, tobacco bits, matches and lighters are the main products made by Swedish Match. The company also sells complementary products, such as razors, batteries and light bulbs, on the Brazilian market.

=== Organization ===

The organizational structure consists of three divisions, along with corporate functions.

==== Europe division ====

The Europe division develops, manufactures, markets and sells snus, nicotine pouches and other smokeless products. The geographic scope is international except North America, with a focus on Europe.

==== US division ====

The US Division produces chewing tobacco, cigars, moist snuff and nicotine pouches for the American market. It is also responsible for sales and marketing in the United States.

==== Lights division ====

The Lights division manufactures and markets matches and lighters, with production in Brazil, the Netherlands, the Philippines, and Sweden. The main markets are Europe, Asia, Brazil and parts of Africa. The division also sells complementary products, mainly in Brazil.

===Operating locations and factories===
Swedish Match operates in eleven countries and has production units in seven of those: Brazil, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Sweden and the US. The company has 15 factories.

The table below presents an overview of Swedish Match&#x27;s operations as of 2021: 
Production of matches and lightersThe matches produced by Swedish Match are safety matches and are manufactured in Sweden and Brazil. The entity that produces matches in Sweden, Swedish Match Industries AB, is since 2009 certified according to the Forest Stewardship Council chain of custody standard and the standard for controlled wood. The matches are manufactured according to the European match standards EN 1783:1997.
40 percent of the production is sold in Europe and 60 percent to Africa, Central America, The Caribbean, Oceania and the Middle East. The Swedish manufacturing facilities are located in Tidaholm and Vetlanda. In Brazil, 95% of the wood consumption for safety matches and matchboxes is from Swedish Match&#x27;s own plantations. Swedish Match produces lighters in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Brazil.

==Market==
While today&#x27;s Swedish Match still produces matches, the majority of its sales and operating profits comes from its smokeless tobacco products such as snus, nicotine pouches, moist snuff and chewing tobacco. In 2021, these smokeless products accounted for 67 percent of sales and 74 percent of Swedish Match&#x27;s operating profit, whereas matches and lighters accounted for 7 percent of sales and 4 percent of operating profit. Swedish Match&#x27;s cigars accounted for 26 percent of sales and 23 percent of the operating profit.
Swedish Match generates most of its sales in Scandinavia and the US(93 percent of company sales in 2021) but also has a significant worldwide presence through its matches and lighters businesses.

===Smokefree products===
Scandinavia and the US are the primary markets for Swedish Match&#x27;s smokefree products. The company is market leader in snus in both Sweden and Norway. In 2021, the operating profit for smokefree products (chew bags, tobacco bits, snus, moist snuff, nicotine pouches and chewing tobacco) increased to 5,998 MSEK (5,142 MSEK in 2021).
The market for Scandinavian snus and the US moist snuff/snus is approximately 1.745 billion cans per year (345 million cans in Scandinavia and 1.4 billion cans in the US). The snus market in the US is about $175 million, and Swedish Match has about 10 percent of the market.

===Cigars===
In 2014, the US cigar market was estimated to more than 5 billion cigars (excluding little cigars) of which Swedish Match produced 1.1 billion sticks of cigars. The cigar market grew 9 percent compared to 2013 in terms of volume. Swedish Match&#x27;s share was even greater in the recent past, as a series of acquisitions between 1999 and 2010 including General Cigar and Scandinavian Tobacco Group (STG) which is the world&#x27;s largest cigar producer and manufactures more than 50 percent of the world&#x27;s pipe tobacco. Control of major brands such as Macanudo, Punch, Cohiba, CAO and La Gloria Cubana gave Swedish Match nearly 1/3 of the US premium cigar market in addition to its strong position in machine-made cigars. However, in 2014 Swedish Match, having reorganized its premium-cigar businesses under the STG umbrella, spun off STG as a public company. Swedish Match&#x27;s cigar business is now limited to machine-made mass-production brands such as White Owl and Garcia y Vega.

===Matches and lighters===
Swedish Match supplies matches worldwide. The main markets for matches are Europe, Asia and the Americas. For lighters, the most important markets are Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Russia, Scandinavia, France and UK. In 2021, 59 billion matchsticks were produced and 325 million lighters. Sales for matches and lighters was 1,338 MSEK (1,149 MSEK in 2020) and the operating profit increased by 0.8 percent to 1,453 MSEK (1,382 MSEK in 2020).

===Main brands===
Below are Swedish Match&#x27;s main brands along with market information as of 2021:
Swedish Match is also active on the Brazilian market with disposable razors, batteries, light bulbs and toothpicks under the Fiat Lux brand.

===Market position and competition===

In 2019, cigarettes made up 88 percent of the global tobacco market by value, smokeless products 2 percent and other products, which includes e-cigarettes, 10 percent. Swedish Match is active in the smokeless products category, with several types of smokeless products, as well as in the other products category, with cigars.

==== In the United States ====

For nicotine pouches in 2019, Swedish Match was number one in the U.S. market, with 84 percent. The main competitors, in descending order, were BAT (Reynolds American) and Altria.

For moist snuff in 2019, Swedish Match was number three in the U.S. market, with 8 percent. The main competitors, in descending order, were Altria (USSTC) and BAT (Reynolds American).

For chewing tobacco in 2019, Swedish Match was number one in the U.S. market, with 41 percent. The main competitors, in descending order, were National Tobacco, Swisher, and BAT (Reynolds American).

For mass market cigars, excluding little cigars, in 2019, Swedish Match was number two in the U.S. market, with 22 percent. The main competitors, in descending order, were Swisher, Altria (Middleton), and Imperial Brands (ITG Brands).

==== In Scandinavia ====

For snus in 2019, Swedish Match was number one in both the Swedish and Norwegian markets, with 61 and 55 percent, respectively.

For nicotine pouches in 2019, Swedish Match was number two in the Swedish market and number three in the Norwegian market, with 26 and 15 percent, respectively.

For snus and nicotine pouches combined in 2019, Swedish Match was number one in both the Swedish and Norwegian markets, with 60 and 49 percent, respectively. In Sweden, the main competitors, in descending order, were Imperial Brands, BAT, and Japan Tobacco International. In Norway, the main competitors, in descending order, were Imperial Brands and BAT.

===Swedish Match in the US===
In the US, Swedish Match produces and distributes the Longhorn, Timber Wolf and Red Man brands of moist snuff. The company also expanded into the United States premium cigar business by purchasing General Cigar Company Inc. (producer of non-Cuban versions of Macanudo, Partagas and Punch) from Edgar Cullman and El Credito Cigar Company (producer of La Gloria Cubana and El Rico Habano) from Ernesto Perez-Carrillo. In October 2010, the company transferred its US premium cigar and European cigar businesses, as well as its pipe tobacco and accessories businesses, to a new company named Scandinavian Tobacco Group, while receiving a 49 percent ownership stake in the new company.

In an effort to expand its snus business outside of Sweden and Norway, the company has, since 2009, been selling its Scandinavian market leading brand of snus, General, at tobacco retailers in the US. The distribution of General snus has increased over the years, from being sold in approximately 10,000 stores in 2012 to more than 24,000 stores by the end of 2014.

For the US, snus is a relatively new category while the main smokeless category is moist snuff. Moist snuff is made using fermentation. Snus is made using a steam heat process (much like pasteurisation) and is usually placed under the upper lip, which means that spitting is not necessary.

<text>Idrija (, in older sources &quot;Zgornja Idrija&quot;; , ) is a town in western Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Idrija. Located in the traditional region of the Slovene Littoral and in the Gorizia Statistical Region, it is notable for its mercury mine with stores and infrastructure, as well as miners&#x27; living quarters, and a miners&#x27; theatre. Together with the Spanish mine at Almadén, it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2012. In 2011, Idrija was given the Alpine Town of the Year award.

==Geography==

The town of Idrija lies in the Idrija Basin, surrounded by the Idrija Hills. It is traversed by the Idrijca River, which is joined there by Nikova Creek. It includes the neighborhoods of Brusovše, Cegovnica, Prenjuta, and Žabja Vas close to the town center, as well as the more outlying hamlets of Češnjice, Ljubevč, Marof, Mokraška Vas, Podroteja, Staje, and Zahoda. The Marof hydroelectric plant is located on the Idrijca River on the northern outskirts of Idrija, between Marof and Mokraška Vas. Springs in the area include Podroteja Spring and Wild Lake on the Idrijca River south of the town.
==History==

Mercury was discovered in Idrija (known as &quot;Idria&quot; under Austrian rule) in the late 15th century (various sources cite 1490, 1492, and 1497). To support the mining activities, Gewerkenegg Castle was constructed between 1522 and 1533 by the mine owners. Mining operations were taken over by the government in 1580. The mineral idrialite, discovered here in 1832, is named after the town.
In the Middle Ages, Idrija was managed by the Patriarchate of Aquileia and the Counts of Gorizia as part of the Governorate of Tolmin, which became independent in the 15th century. After 1500, Idrija was occupied for one year by the Republic of Venice (in 1508), but it was otherwise governed by the House of Habsburg. In March 1511, it was affected by the forceful 1511 Idrija earthquake. For long time Idrija was a cornerstone of the global supply of mercury. As such, Idrija supplied mercury needed in the silver mines of the Spanish Empire when the mercury mines of Almadén and Huancavelica faltered in their deliveries. In the 18th century, Idrija gained the rights of a market town. From 1783 until the 1910s, it was part of the Inner Carniola &quot;Kreis&quot;. In 1920, it came under Italy with the Treaty of Rapallo. In September 1943, it became part of the Nazi Germany and was then heavily rocketed by the SAAF in 1945. After the war, it formed part of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia within Yugoslavia and became a town in independent Slovenia in June 1991.

Today, its inhabitants mostly consider it part of the Slovene Littoral.
===Legend===
According to legend, a bucket maker working in a local spring spotted a small amount of liquid mercury over 500 years ago. Idrija is one of the few places in the world where mercury occurs in both its elemental liquid state and as cinnabar (mercury sulfide) ore. The subterranean shaft mine entrance known as Anthony&#x27;s Shaft (&quot;Antonijev rov&quot;) is used today for tours of the upper levels, complete with life-sized depictions of workers over the ages. The lower levels, which extend to almost 400 meters below the surface and are no longer being actively mined, are currently being cleaned up.

==Church==
The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Joseph the Worker and belongs to the Diocese of Koper. There are three other churches in Idrija, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, Saint Anthony of Padua, and Our Lady of Sorrows.

<doc id="659683" wikidata="Q854550" url="?curid=659683" title="Hoodoo (geology)">
<text>A hoodoo (also called a tent rock, fairy chimney, or earth pyramid) is a tall, thin spire of rock formed by erosion. Hoodoos typically consist of relatively soft rock topped by harder, less easily eroded stone that protects each column from the elements. They generally form within sedimentary rock and volcanic rock formations.

Hoodoos range in size from the height of an average human to heights exceeding a 10-story building. Hoodoo shapes are affected by the erosional patterns of alternating hard and softer rock layers. Minerals deposited within different rock types can cause hoodoos to have different colors throughout their height.

==Etymology==

In certain regions of western North America these rocky structures are called hoodoos. Hoodoo comes from a Southern Paiute word, oo’doo, which refers to a thing that is scary or inspires fear. Hoodos form part of some legends of Native Americans in the American Southwest. For example, hoodoos in Bryce Canyon National Park were considered petrified remains of ancient beings who had been sanctioned for misbehavior. Despite the similar name, the term for these rock formations is not related to Hoodoo spirituality.

==Occurrence==

Hoodoos are found mainly in the desert in dry, hot areas. In common usage, the difference between hoodoos and pinnacles (or spires) is that hoodoos have a variable thickness often described as having a &quot;totem pole-shaped body&quot;. A spire, however, has a smoother profile or uniform thickness that tapers from the ground upward.
Hoodoo formations are commonly found on the Colorado Plateau and in the Badland regions of the northern Great Plains (both in North America). While hoodoos are scattered throughout these areas, nowhere in the world are they so abundant as in the northern section of Bryce Canyon National Park, located in the U.S. state of Utah. Hoodoos are also very prominent a few hundred miles away at Goblin Valley State Park on the eastern side of the San Rafael Swell, at Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument in north central New Mexico, and in the Chiricahua National Monument of Southeast Arizona. Some hoodoos are found in Sombrerete, Mexico at the Sierra de Organos National Park.

Hoodoos are also found in the Cappadocia region of Turkey, where houses have been carved into the formations. These hoodoos were depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 50 new lira banknote of 2005–2009.

In Armenia, hoodoos are found in Goris, Khndzoresk, Hin Khot and several other places in the marz of Syunik, where many were once carved into and inhabited or used.
In French, the formations are called &quot;demoiselles coiffées&quot; (ladies with hairdos) or &quot;cheminées de fées&quot; (fairy chimneys) and several are found in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence; one of the best-known examples is the formation called Demoiselles Coiffées de Pontis.

The hoodoo stones on the northern coast of Taiwan are unusual for their coastal setting. The stones formed as the seabed rose rapidly out of the ocean during the Miocene epoch. Efforts have been made to slow the erosion in the case of iconic specimens in Wanli.

The Awa Sand Pillars in Tokushima Prefecture, Japan, are hoodoos made from layers of compacted gravel and sandstone.

Đavolja Varoš (Devil&#x27;s Town) hoodoos in Serbia feature about 200 formations described as earth pyramids or towers by local inhabitants. Since 1959, Đavolja Varoš has been protected by the state. The site was also a nominee in the New Seven Wonders of Nature campaign.

The hoodoos in Drumheller, Alberta, are composed of clay and sand deposited between 70 and 75 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period. These hoodoos can maintain a unique mushroom-like appearance as the underlying base erodes at a faster rate compared to the capstones at a rate of nearly one centimeter per year, faster than most geologic structures.

==Formation==
Hoodoos typically form in areas where a thick layer of a relatively soft rock, such as mudstone, poorly cemented sandstone, or tuff (consolidated volcanic ash), is covered by a thin layer of hard rock, such as well-cemented sandstone, limestone, or basalt. In glaciated mountainous valleys the soft eroded material may be glacial till with the protective capstones being large boulders in the till. Over time, cracks in the resistant layer allow the much softer rock beneath to be eroded and washed away. Hoodoos form where a small cap of the resistant layer remains, and protects a cone of the underlying softer layer from erosion. The heavy cap pressing downward gives the pedestal of the hoodoo its strength to resist erosion. With time, erosion of the soft layer causes the cap to be undercut, eventually falling off, and the remaining cone is then quickly eroded.

Typically, hoodoos form from weathering processes that continuously work together in eroding the edges of a rock formation known as a fin. For example, the primary weathering force at Bryce Canyon is frost wedging. The hoodoos at Bryce Canyon experience more than 200 freeze-thaw cycles each year. In the winter, melting snow, in the form of water, seeps into the cracks and then freezes at night. When water freezes, it expands by almost 10%, prying open the cracks bit by bit, making them even wider, similar to the way a pothole forms in a paved road.

In addition to frost wedging, rain is another weathering process causing erosion. In most places today, rainwater is slightly acidic, which lets the weak carbonic acid slowly dissolve limestone grain by grain. It is this process that rounds the edges of hoodoos and gives them their lumpy and bulging profiles. Where internal mudstone and siltstone layers interrupt the limestone, one may expect the rock to be more resistant to the chemical weathering because of the comparative lack of limestone. Many of the more durable hoodoos are capped with a special kind of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite, being fortified by the mineral magnesium, dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath it. Rain is also the chief source of erosion (removing the debris). In the summer, monsoon-type rainstorms travel through the Bryce Canyon region bringing short-duration high-intensity rain.

<text>In psychology, schizotypy is a theoretical concept that posits a continuum of personality characteristics and experiences, ranging from normal dissociative, imaginative states to extreme states of mind related to psychosis, especially schizophrenia. The continuum of personality proposed in schizotypy is in contrast to a categorical view of psychosis, wherein psychosis is considered a particular (usually pathological) state of mind, which the person either has or does not have.

==Development of the concept==

The categorical view of psychosis is most associated with Emil Kraepelin, who created criteria for the medical diagnosis and classification of different forms of psychotic illness. Particularly, he made the distinction between dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia), manic depressive insanity and non-psychotic states. Modern diagnostic systems used in psychiatry (such as the DSM) maintain this categorical view.

In contrast, psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler did not believe there was a clear separation between sanity and madness, believing instead that psychosis was simply an extreme expression of thoughts and behaviours that could be present to varying degrees throughout the population.

The concept of psychosis as a spectrum was further developed by psychologists such as Hans Eysenck and Gordon Claridge, who sought to understand unusual variations in thought and behaviour in terms of personality theory. Eysenck conceptualised cognitive and behavioral variations as all together forming a single personality trait, &quot;psychoticism&quot;.

Meehl et al. 1964 first coined the term &#x27;schizotypy,&#x27; and through examination of unusual experiences in the general population and clustering of symptoms in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. The work of Claridge suggested that this personality trait was more complex than had been previously thought and could be broken down into four factors.

# &quot;Unusual experiences&quot;: The disposition to have unusual perceptual and other cognitive experiences, such as hallucinations, magical or superstitious belief and interpretation of events (see also delusions). This factor is also often referred to as &quot;positive schizotypy&quot; and &quot;cognitive-perceptual&quot; schizotypy 
# &quot;Cognitive disorganization&quot;: A tendency for thoughts to become derailed, disorganised or tangential (see also formal thought disorder). This factor is also often referred to as &quot;disorganized schizotypy&quot;
# &quot;Introverted anhedonia&quot;: A tendency to introverted, emotionally flat and asocial behaviour, associated with a deficiency in the ability to feel pleasure from social and physical stimulation. This factor is also often referred to as &quot;negative schizotypy&quot; and &quot;schizoidia&quot;
# &quot;Impulsive nonconformity&quot;: The disposition to unstable mood and behaviour particularly with regard to rules and social conventions.

==The relationship between schizotypy, mental health and mental illness==

Although aiming to reflect some of the features present in diagnosable mental illness, schizotypy does not necessarily imply that someone who is more schizotypal than someone else is more ill. For example, certain aspects of schizotypy may be beneficial. Both the &quot;unusual experiences&quot; and &quot;cognitive disorganisation&quot; aspects have been linked to creativity and artistic achievement. Jackson proposed the concept of &#x27;benign schizotypy&#x27; in relation to certain classes of religious experience, which he suggested might be regarded as a form of problem-solving and therefore of adaptive value. The link between positive schizotypy and certain facets of creativity is consistent with the notion of a &quot;healthy schizotypy&quot;, which may account for the persistence of schizophrenia-related genes in the population despite their many dysfunctional aspects. The extent of schizotypy can be measured using certain diagnostic tests, such as the O-LIFE.

However, the exact nature of the relationship between schizotypy and diagnosable psychotic illness is still controversial. One of the key concerns that researchers have had is that questionnaire-based measures of schizotypy, when analysed using factor analysis, do not suggest that schizotypy is a unified, homogeneous concept. The three main approaches have been labelled as &#x27;quasi-dimensional&#x27;, &#x27;dimensional&#x27; and &#x27;fully dimensional&#x27;.

Each approach is sometimes used to imply that schizotypy reflects a cognitive or biological vulnerability to psychosis, although this may remain dormant and never express itself, unless triggered by appropriate environmental events or conditions (such as certain doses of drugs or high levels of stress).

===Quasi-dimensional approach===

The quasi-dimensional model may be traced back to Bleuler (the inventor of the term &#x27;schizophrenia&#x27;), who commented on two types of continuity between normality and psychosis: that between the schizophrenic and their relatives, and that between the patient&#x27;s premorbid and post-morbid personalities (i.e. their personality before and after the onset of overt psychosis).

On the first score he commented: &#x27;If one observes the relatives of our patients, one often finds in them peculiarities which are qualitatively identical with those of the patients themselves, so that the disease appears to be only a quantitative increase of the anomalies seen in the parents and siblings.&#x27;

On the second point, Bleuler discusses in a number of places whether peculiarities displayed by the patient before admission to hospital should be regarded as premonitory &quot;symptoms&quot; of the disease or merely indications of a &quot;predisposition&quot; to develop it.

Despite these observations of continuity Bleuler himself remained an advocate of the disease model of schizophrenia. To this end he invoked a concept of &quot;latent schizophrenia&quot;, writing: &#x27;In [the latent] form, we can see &quot;in nuce&quot; [in a nutshell] all the symptoms and all the combinations of symptoms which are present in the manifest types of the disease.&#x27;

Later advocates of the quasi-dimensional view of schizotypy are Rado and Meehl, according to both of whom schizotypal symptoms merely represent less explicitly expressed manifestations of the underlying disease process which is schizophrenia. Rado proposed the term &#x27;schizotype&#x27; to describe the person whose genetic make-up gave them a lifelong predisposition to schizophrenia.

The quasi-dimensional model is so called because the only dimension it postulates is that of gradations of severity or explicitness in relation to the symptoms of a disease process: namely schizophrenia.

===Dimensional approach===

The dimensional approach, influenced by personality theory, argues that full blown psychotic illness is just the most extreme end of the schizotypy spectrum and there is a natural continuum between people with low and high levels of schizotypy. This model is most closely associated with the work of Hans Eysenck, who regarded the person exhibiting the full-blown manifestations of psychosis as simply someone occupying the extreme upper end of his &#x27;psychoticism&#x27; dimension.

Support for the dimensional model comes from the fact that high-scorers on measures of schizotypy may meet, or partially fulfill, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizoid personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Similarly, when analyzed, schizotypy traits often break down into similar groups as do symptoms from schizophrenia (although they are typically present in much less intense forms).

===Fully dimensional approach===
Claridge calls the latest version of his model &#x27;the fully dimensional approach&#x27;. However, it might also be characterised as the &quot;hybrid&quot; or &quot;composite&quot; approach, as it incorporates elements of both the disease model and the dimensional one.

On this latest Claridge model, schizotypy is regarded as a dimension of personality, normally distributed throughout the population, as in the Eysenck model. However, schizophrenia itself is regarded as a breakdown process, quite distinct from the continuously distributed trait of schizotypy, and forming a second, graded continuum, ranging from schizotypal personality disorder to full-blown schizophrenic psychosis.

The model is characterised as fully dimensional because, not only is the personality trait of schizotypy continuously graded, but the independent continuum of the breakdown processes is also graded rather than categorical.

The fully dimensional approach argues that full blown psychosis is not just high schizotypy, but must involve other factors that make it qualitatively different and pathological.

== Relationship to other personality traits and sociodemographics==
Many research studies have examined the relationship between schizotypy and various standard models of personality, such as the five factor model. Research has linked the unusual experiences factor to high neuroticism and openness to experience. Unusual experience in combination with positive affectivity also appears to predict religiosity/spirituality. One study found that a moderate level of unusual experiences predicted increased religiosity, but a high level of unusual experiences predicted lower religiosity, and that impulsive non-conformity was associated with lower religiosity, as well as lower values of tradition and conformity. The introvertive anhedonia factor has been linked to high neuroticism and low extraversion. The cognitive disorganisation factor as well as the impulsive non-conformity factor have been linked to low conscientiousness. It has been argued that these findings provide evidence for a fully dimensional model of schizotypy and that there is a continuum between normal personality and schizotypy.

Relationships between schizotypy and the Temperament and Character Inventory have also been examined. Self-transcendence, a trait associated with openness to &quot;spiritual&quot; ideas and experiences, has moderate positive associations with schizotypy, particularly with unusual experiences. Cloninger described the specific combination of high self-transcendence, low cooperativeness, and low self-directedness as a &quot;schizotypal personality style&quot; and research has found that this specific combination of traits is associated with a &quot;high risk&quot; of schizotypy. Low cooperativeness and self-directedness combined with high self-transcendence may result in openness to odd or unusual ideas and behaviours associated with distorted perceptions of reality. On the other hand, high levels of cooperativeness and self-directedness may protect against the schizotypal tendencies associated with high self-transcendence.

One study examined the relationship between the dimensional MBTI scales, and found that schizotypy was associated with a tendency toward introversion, intuition (as opposed to sensing), thinking (as opposed to feeling), and prospecting (as opposed to judging), which can be represented by the &quot;INTP&quot; personality type in the MBTI model. Intuition is conceptually similar to the Big Five &quot;openness to experience&quot; trait which is thought to be increased in schizotypy, thinking represents the tendency to prefer objectivity and evidence in making decisions and forming beliefs and is conceptually similar to the lower level &quot;intellect&quot; factor of openness in the Big Five, and prospecting is conceptually similar to low conscientiousness in the Big Five.

Schizotypy shows positive associations with traits that are associated with fast life history strategies, including increased sociosexuality (characterized by increased effort for short term sexual relationships, lower effort for long term sexual relationships, increased total amount of sexual partners, and lower sexual disgust) and impulsivity.

===Personality disorders===
Schizotypy shows positive associations with overall psychopathy, however when considering the primary and secondary factors of psychopathy, schizotypy is associated with lower primary psychopathy (also called fearless dominance) and higher secondary psychopathy (also called self-centered impulsivity, or disinhibition). Narcissism is negatively associated with schizotypy, (though persons high in schizotypy may experience grandiose delusions along with idionomia, a sense of deviance and enlightenment, which may be mistaken for narcissism), and borderline personality traits are positively associated with schizotypy as well hypomanic personality traits. Schizotypy also shows positive relationships with schizoid, paranoid, and avoidant personality traits, and a negative relationship with obsessive-compulsive personality traits (particularly with disorganized schizotypy). In contrast to obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder shows a positive relationship with schizotypy.

===Cognitive function===
There is evidence that schizotypy correlates with differentially enhanced and impaired aspects of cognitive function. These findings include schizotypy being positively associated with enhanced global processing over local processing, lower latent inhibition, attention &amp; memory deficits, enhanced creativity &amp; imagination, and enhanced associative thinking.

===Autism===
Correlational studies of schizotypy and autistic traits tend to find positive correlations, most strongly with negative schizotypy, to a lesser extent disorganized schizotypy, and weak, absent, or negative correlations with positive schizotypy. Diagnosed schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) also overlap statistically.

However, several researchers have suggested that positive correlations between schizotypy and autism are not necessarily evidence of overlap, but rather are due to a lack of specificity of measurements for autistic and schizotypal traits, and the confounding variable of social difficulties and social-cognitive dysfunction which occur in both autism and schizotypy. Researchers have suggested that high comorbidity between diagnosed ASD and schizophrenia are highly unreliable and misleading due to a severe inadequacy of the DSM and diagnostic interviews for differential diagnosis. Studies which show apparent overlap between the causes of autism and the causes of schizotypy also have significant methodological issues.

Multiple evolutionary theories of schizotypy place schizotypy and autistic traits at opposite poles of a continuum, with relation to traits such as theory of mind, life history and mating strategies, &quot;mentalistic&quot; or creative cognition and &quot;mechanistic&quot; cognition, and predictive processing. In agreement with this, schizotypy (particularly positive, impulsive, and disorganized schizotypy) shows a negative association with autistic traits when controlling for social difficulty, which has been well replicated across different countries, scales, methods, and independent research teams, and a diametric autism-schizotypy continuum factor emerges through factor analysis. Notably, some studies find a direct negative association with positive schizotypy and autistic traits even when social difficulty is not controlled for.

Some researchers have interpreted these findings as indicating that autistic and schizotypal traits are both overlapping and diametrical in different aspects, with autistic social difficulties and negative schizotypal symptoms being a shared dimension, and positive, disorganized, and impulsive schizotypy as a dimension that is diametrically opposed to autism.

==Possible biological bases of schizotypy==

===Cognitive imbalances and tradeoffs===

====Predictive processing====
Andersen (2022) put forth a model of schizotypy based on the predictive processing framework, where lower importance is attributed to sensory prediction errors for updating beliefs in individuals with high schizotypy. Essentially, this means that schizotypy is a cognitive-perceptual specialization for processing chaotic and noisy data, where patterns and relationships exist but can only be detected if minor inconsistencies are ignored (i.e., focusing on the &#x27;big picture&#x27;). Andersen suggests that a tradeoff exists in predictive processing, where giving higher weight to prediction errors prevents the detection of false patterns (i.e. apophenia) at the cost of being unable to detect higher level patterns, and giving lower weight to prediction errors allows for the detection of higher level patterns at the cost of occasionally detecting patterns that don&#x27;t exist, as in delusions and hallucinations that occur in schizotypy. This model explains features of schizotypy and previous models of schizotypy, such as the hyper-mentalizing model originally proposed by Abu-Akel (1999), hyper-associative cognition, the hyper-imagination model by Crespi (2016), antagonomia (acting in ways directly opposing societal values) and idiosyncratic worldviews, attentional differences such as latent inhibition, hyper-openness, increased exploratory behavior, and enhanced cognitive abilities in insight problem solving, creativity, and global processing.

===Hormone abnormalities===

====Oxytocin &amp; testosterone====
There is some evidence to suggest that abnormalities in the regulation of oxytocin and testosterone are related to schizotypy. Crespi (2015) provides evidence that schizophrenia and related disorders may involve increased or dysregulated oxytocin, and relatively decreased testosterone, leading to &quot;hyper-developed&quot; social cognition, although Crespi&#x27;s model of schizotypy has been criticized. Evidence for oxytocin&#x27;s role in schizotypy includes genes associated with higher oxytocin levels being associated with higher levels of positive schizotypy, blood oxytocin levels positively associated with schizotypy in females, ratio of genes associated with low testosterone and high oxytocin positively associated with schizotypy and negatively with autistic traits, oxytocin levels being associated with higher social anxiety, and oxytocin being associated with global processing, divergent thinking, and creativity, which are also strongly associated with schizotypy.

===Anhedonia===
Anhedonia, or a reduced ability to experience pleasure, is a feature of full-blown schizophrenia that was commented on by both Kraepelin and Bleuler. However, they regarded it as just one among a number of features that tended to characterise the ‘deterioration’, as they saw it, of the schizophrenic&#x27;s emotional life. In other words, it was an effect, rather than a cause, of the disease process.

Rado reversed this way of thinking, and ascribed anhedonia a causal role. He considered that the crucial neural deficit in the schizotype was an ‘integrative pleasure deficiency’, i.e. an innate deficiency in the ability to experience pleasure. Meehl took on this view, and attempted to relate this deficiency to abnormality in the dopamine system in the brain, which is implicated in the human reward system.

Questionnaire research on schizotypy in normal subjects is ambiguous with regard to the causal role, if any, of anhedonia. Nettle and McCreery and Claridge found that high schizotypes as measured by factor 1 (above) scored lower than controls on the introverted anhedonia factor, as if they were particularly enjoying life.

Various writers, including Kelley and Coursey and L.J. and J.P. Chapman suggest that anhedonia, if present as a pre-existent trait in a person, may act as a potentiating factor, whereas a high capacity for hedonic enjoyment might act as a protecting one.

===Weakness of inhibitory mechanisms===

====Negative priming====

Negative priming is &quot;the ability of a preceding stimulus to inhibit the response to a subsequent stimulus.&quot; Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizotypy exhibit “reduced or abolished NP [negative priming], especially in the presence of positive symptomatology, acute psychosis, high severity of symptoms, and/or lack of medication.”

====Semantic activation without conscious identification====

The phenomenon of semantic activation without conscious identification (SAWCI) is said to be displayed when a person shows a priming effect from the processing of consciously undetectable words. For example, a person who has just been shown the word ‘giraffe’, but at a speed at which he or she was not able consciously to report what it was, may nevertheless identify more quickly than usual another animal word on the next trial. Evans found that high schizotypes showed a greater priming effect than controls in such a situation. She argued that this could be accounted for by a relative weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in the semantic networks of high schizotypes.

====Attention, working memory, and executive functions====

Schizotypy symptoms have been related to deficits in executive functions, which entails the psychological processes that supersede habitual inclinations with novel responses and behaviors to fulfill important goals. In particular, when schizotypy is elevated, the ability to filter out task-irrelevant stimuli may be impaired. That is, participants who score highly on schizotypy tend to fail to ignore a previously preexposed, non-reinforced stimulus as compared to a non-preexposed, novel and potentially important event.

Enhanced performance on verbal fluency has been associated with high levels of positive schizotypy, i.e. increased reports of hallucination-like experiences, delusional ideation, and perceptual aberrations. However, decreased performance was associated with negative schizotypy, such as anhedonia.

Many studies have also shown that individuals who exhibit schizotypy features demonstrate deficits in attention and working memory.

===Abnormalities of arousal===

Claridge suggested that one consequence of a weakness of inhibitory mechanisms in high schizotypes and schizophrenics might be a relative failure of homeostasis in the central nervous system. It was proposed that this could lead to both lability of arousal and dissociation of arousal in different parts of the nervous system.

====Dissociation of different arousal systems====

Claridge and co-workers have found various types of abnormal co-variation between different psychophysiological variables in schizotypes, including between measures of cortical and autonomic arousal.

McCreery and Claridge found evidence of a relative activation of the right cerebral hemisphere as compared with the left in high schizotypes attempting to induce a hallucinatory episode in the laboratory. This suggested a relative dissociation of arousal between the two hemispheres in such people as compared with controls.

====Hyperarousal====

A failure of homeostasis in the central nervous system could lead to episodes of hyper-arousal. Oswald has pointed out that extreme stress and hyper-arousal can lead to sleep as a provoked reaction. McCreery has suggested that this could account for the phenomenological similarities between Stage 1 sleep and psychosis, which include hallucinations, delusions, and flattened or inappropriate affect (emotions). On this model, high schizotypes and schizophrenics are people who are liable to what Oswald calls &#x27;micro-sleeps&#x27;, or intrusions of Stage 1 sleep phenomena into waking consciousness, on account of their tendency to high arousal.

In support of this view McCreery points to the high correlation that has been found to exist between scores on the Chapmans&#x27; Perceptual Aberration scale, which measures proneness to perceptual anomalies such as hallucinations, and the Chapmans&#x27; Hypomania scale, which measures a tendency to episodes of heightened arousal. This correlation is found despite the fact that there is no overlap of item content between the two scales.

In the clinical field there is also the paradoxical finding of Stevens and Darbyshire, that schizophrenic patients exhibiting the symptom of catatonia can be aroused from their apparent stupor by the administration of sedative rather than stimulant drugs. They wrote: &#x27;The psychic state in catatonic schizophrenia can be described as one of great excitement (i.e., hyperalertness)[...] The inhibition of activity apparently does not alter the inner seething excitement.&#x27;

It is argued that such a view would be consistent with the model that suggests schizophrenics and high schizotypes are people with a tendency to hyper-arousal.

====Aberrant salience hypothesis====

Kapur (2003) proposed that a hyperdopaminergic state, at a &quot;brain&quot; level of description, leads to an aberrant assignment of salience to the elements of one&#x27;s experience, at a &quot;mind&quot; level. Dopamine mediates the conversion of the neural representation of an external stimulus from a neutral bit of information into an attractive or aversive entity, i.e. a salient event. Symptoms of schizophrenia and schizotypy may arise out of ‘the aberrant assignment of salience to external objects and internal representations’; and antipsychotic medications may reduce positive symptoms by attenuating aberrant motivational salience, via blockade of the Dopamine D2 receptors (Kapur, 2003). There is no evidence however on a link between attentional irregularities and enhanced stimulus salience in schizotypy.

<doc id="659688" wikidata="Q8039493" url="?curid=659688" title="Wyatt Earp (card game)">
<text>Wyatt Earp is a rummy-like card game first released in 2001. The game is named after Wyatt Earp, a famous lawman, and is set in the American Old West. It is manufactured by Rio Grande Games and was created by Mike Fitzgerald and Richard Borg for Alea.

== Rule summary ==
The following is a partial summary of the rules of play.

Each player tries to earn reward money by participating in the capture of seven outlaws during multiple rounds of play. Outlaws are captured through the accumulation of capture points, awarded to players who play sets or melds of cards representing the outlaws, &quot;or&quot; who play cards which build on the melds of others. Cards almost always have reward amounts associated with them; playing a card adds to the reward for the outlaw associated with the play.

As in rummy or gin rummy, a meld is three or more matching cards. In &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, card matches are not determined by suits; instead, cards are matched based on a color marking associated with each of the seven outlaws.

A round starts with each player being dealt ten cards, with one of the remaining cards used to establish the discard pile (face up) and the rest of the deck serving as the card supply, face down.

Each player&#x27;s turn consists of three steps:
# drawing either the top card from the discard pile or two cards from the card supply;
# optionally playing one or more cards from their hand; and
# discarding a card.

A round usually ends when a player discards the last card from their hand. It can also end when the card supply is exhausted again (i.e. a second time) after having been restocked once from the discard pile. Or most rarely, it ends after a player discards a card as the third step of their turn and another player, as a result of play during that turn, is left with no cards.

Capture points are assessed and reward money is distributed at the end of a round. Players with the most capture points for a given outlaw get the largest share of the reward money for that outlaw; a player gets all of an outlaw&#x27;s reward money if their capture point total for that outlaw is at least five points higher than any other player&#x27;s total for that outlaw.

The game ends when one player has accumulated at least $25,000 in reward money.

== Outlaw cards ==
Of the 78 cards in the deck, 49 are outlaw cards, seven of each of seven outlaws:
Billy the Kid,
Butch Cassidy,
Bob Dalton,
Wes Hardin,
Jesse James,
the Sundance Kid,
and
Belle Starr.

Outlaw cards are worth two capture points each. A meld of three must be played the first time any player lays down cards for a particular outlaw. After that, outlaw cards can be played individually, by any player, though rules encourage multiple cards to be played at a time. That&#x27;s because playing a single outlaw card does not increase an outlaw&#x27;s reward; playing two at a time add $1000 to the reward, playing three at a time adds $2000, and so on; in other words, the reward added for a play is (N − 1) × $1000, where
N is the number of outlaw cards being played together.

== Sheriff cards ==
There are also 29 sheriff cards, which combine with the outlaw cards to form the 78-card deck used in the game. A bit more than half of the sheriff cards increase the capture points and rewards associated with an outlaw:

* Four &quot;Bank Robbery&quot; cards add two capture points and $1000 to the reward for an outlaw;
* Two &quot;Stagecoach Robbery&quot; cards add one capture point and $3000 to a reward;
* Three &quot;Fastest Gun&quot; cards establish an outlaw in that role (replacing any previous holder) and add three capture points and $1000 to the outlaw&#x27;s reward; and
* Seven &quot;Photo&quot; cards, one for each outlaw, add four capture points and $1000 to their reward.

The remaining sheriff cards play other roles in the game:

* Three are &quot;Most Wanted&quot; cards, which let a player take a card from another player;
* Three are &quot;Hideout&quot; cards, used to block the capture point value of a meld of another player; and
* Seven are &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; cards, which are used to add to or exchange cards in a player&#x27;s hand, or to remove a hideout.

A player is allowed but not required to use only one sheriff card per turn.

Based on card type, players are sometimes required to draw, or given the option of drawing, a card in order to successfully use a sheriff card. Such a draw is considered to be an attempt to &quot;shoot&quot; the outlaw. If a player draws an outlaw card (which are marked with a bullet hole for this purpose), the shot is successful, and the sheriff card is played. If another sheriff card is drawn, the shot failed, and the original sheriff card has no effect. Those cards for which attempting a shot is optional have greater value when the shot is attempted and successful than the value it has when no attempt is made.

== History ==
The game was first conceived as the fourth in Mike Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Rummy&quot; series, until he decided to collaborate with Richard Borg and publish it through Alea.

&quot;Wyatt Earp&quot; won the 2001 &quot;Meeples&#x27; Choice Award&quot;. It was a finalist for the 2002 Gamers Choice Award, in the category &quot;Best Family Card Card Game&quot;, and was nominated for
the 2003 GAMES 100 Best Family Strategy game.

<doc id="659697" wikidata="Q204393" url="?curid=659697" title="Linda Fiorentino">
<text>Clorinda &quot;Linda&quot; Fiorentino (born March 9, 1958) is an American actress. Fiorentino made her screen debut with a leading role in the 1985 coming-of-age drama film &quot;Vision Quest&quot;, followed that same year with another lead role in the action film &quot;Gotcha!&quot; and an appearance in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;After Hours&quot;. Noted for her &quot;raven hair, intense gaze and low voice&quot;, Fiorentino was placed No. 66 on the 1995 edition of &quot;Empire&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History by a reader&#x27;s poll.

For her performance in the 1994 film &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;, she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Actress of the Year, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She also had leading roles in the erotic thriller &quot;Jade&quot; (1995), the science fiction action comedy film &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997) and the fantasy comedy &quot;Dogma&quot; (1999).

==Early life and education==
Fiorentino was born the third of eight children in an Italian-American family. One of her sisters is model and photographer Donya Fiorentino, who had been married to filmmaker David Fincher and British actor Gary Oldman. Fiorentino&#x27;s parents—a steel contractor and a housewife—raised her in South Philadelphia, and later moved the family to the Turnersville section of Washington Township in nearby South Jersey. Fiorentino was a &quot;bright student&quot; at school but was also rebellious and would “argue with the nuns about the Bible and they seemed to love it.” Fiorentino&#x27;s mother later said, “Linda has a great facade. She comes off as very bold, but she&#x27;s really very shy.”

In 1976, Fiorentino graduated from Washington Township High School in Sewell, New Jersey, where she excelled in basketball, baseball and cheerleading. She began performing in plays at Rosemont College in suburban Philadelphia after falling in with a crowd of “rich Puerto Ricans and Cubans” and found herself in plays because “everyone in the theater there was really weird.” She graduated in 1980 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. After graduation, Fiorentino planned to continue her education at law school, but one of her professors convinced her to pursue a career in acting. She trained at the Circle in the Square Theater School in Manhattan while working as a bartender at the nightclub Kamikaze, where Bruce Willis also worked. Fiorentino has also been an active photographer since 1987 and studied at the International Center of Photography in New York City.

==Career==
=== Early career and breakthrough ===
Fiorentino landed her first professional role after her first professional audition in 1985 when she was cast in &quot;Vision Quest&quot; as Carla, the romantic partner of the lead character, a high school wrestler played by Matthew Modine. Fiorentino beat out Rebecca de Mornay, Rosanna Arquette and Demi Moore for the role. The film was a moderate success in theaters but has gone on to become a cult classic. Film critic Roger Ebert said of the newcomer, &quot;Without having met the actress, it&#x27;s impossible for me to speculate on how much of Carla is original work and how much is Fiorentino&#x27;s personality. What comes across, though, is a woman who is enigmatic without being egotistical, detached without being cold, self-reliant without being suspicious. She has a way of talking – kind of deliberately objective – that makes you listen to everything she says.&quot;

Due to her &quot;cinematic combination of spunk and sexiness&quot;, &quot;a considerable amount of heat&quot; was generated in Fiorentino&#x27;s early career. Subsequently, she was approached by both Tom Cruise and director Tony Scott for the role of Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Blackwood (Cruise&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest) in &quot;Top Gun&quot;. Despite getting along with Cruise and recognising the film&#x27;s commercial potential, Fiorentino declined due to objecting to the film&#x27;s &quot;pro-military stance&quot;; the role was then given to Kelly McGillis.

In 1985, she starred in the espionage comedy film &quot;Gotcha!&quot;, which was filmed in Los Angeles, Paris and Berlin. Her co-star, Anthony Edwards, later directed her in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Ghost Story&quot;. Giving the film two stars out of four, Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; described the European sequences as &quot;a well-directed cat-and-mouse game&quot; that lost its way in the final act after returning to the United States, with the film&#x27;s main flaw being a focus on Edwards&#x27; character when Fiorentino was far more intriguing: &quot;I&#x27;ll bet the men who made this movie just assumed it had to be told from his point of view, and never considered hers. Too bad. I think they missed their best chance.&quot; Fiorentino spoke negatively of the film saying, “It&#x27;s not my kind of film,” and, “These kinds of movies are like drinking beer all the time.”

For the rest of the mid-to-late 1980s, she appeared as a downtown artist in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot; and as the wife of an art collector in 1920&#x27;s Paris in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s &quot;The Moderns&quot;. &quot;After Hours&quot; was critically acclaimed for its black humor, and is considered to be an underrated Scorsese film. Roger Ebert gave &quot;After Hours&quot; a rating of four out of four stars and added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. In its review of &quot;The Moderns&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Fiorentino is ideal as the gorgeous American of a prosaic background over whom men may lose their hearts, mind and lives.&quot;

After her initial career successes, Fiorentino&#x27;s acting career stagnated, although she continued to appear in erotic films such as &quot;Wildfire&quot; and &quot;Chain of Desire&quot;, where she often portrayed &quot;dominating, manipulative characters&quot;. In the early-1990s, director Paul Verhoeven invited Fiorentino to have a supporting role in &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (eventually played by Jeanne Tripplehorn). However, Fiorentino wanted the lead role of Catherine Tramell (later played by Sharon Stone), although she was rebuffed due to having &quot;breasts that were too small&quot;.

=== &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; and critical acclaim ===
Fiorentino experienced a resurgence after she received accolades for her performance in director John Dahl&#x27;s 1994 neo-noir film &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;, playing the murderous &quot;femme fatale&quot; Bridget. Dahl told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that when he began trying to cast the role of Bridget, most of the actresses thought the character was too despicable to be appealing. &quot;But Linda saw the potential in the part and recognized it as something that she could have a lot of fun with,&quot; he said.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described Fiorentino as &quot;a sleek seductress who, like the femmes fatales of [Barbara] Stanwyck&#x27;s day, will stop at nothing to get her way.” Coldhearted enough to double-cross her husband (Bill Pullman) after she persuades him to pull off a drug deal, Bridget heads to an upstate New York town where she goes by &quot;Wendy&quot; and she involves Mike, a gullible hick (Peter Berg) in a murderous scheme. When Bridget, as Wendy, matter-of-factly orders Mike to &quot;take your clothes off and get to the fence,&quot; Fiorentino improvised a scene in which her character and Peter Berg&#x27;s character make love behind the back door of a bar. &quot;I was just trying to keep up with her at that point,&quot; Berg said.

&quot;The Last Seduction&quot; has gained a cult following over time, and its main character, Bridget Gregory, has been recognized as one of the most iconic female villains in film history. Fiorentino said of accepting the role, &quot;After I read that script, I was in Arizona and I got in a car and drove six hours to get to the meeting because I had never read anything so unique in terms of a female character. And I walked in the meeting with John Dahl, the director, and I said, &#x27;John, you are not allowed to hire anyone but me for this film.&#x27; And I wasn&#x27;t kidding.&quot;

In its review of the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Fiorentino&#x27;s performance &quot;flawlessly hard-boiled.&quot; After seeing Fiorentino in the part, Christopher Tookey, the film critic at &quot;The London Daily Mail&quot;, wrote: &quot;The role could easily have been a misogynistic fantasy-woman. But Fiorentino makes you believe in her. I doubt if there will be a more stunning female performance this year.&quot;

Roger Ebert, in his four-star review of the film, wrote that Fiorentino &quot;has a quality about her&quot;. He explained: &quot;In &quot;VisionQuest&quot; (1985), a silly wrestling movie, there was nothing silly about her scenes. In Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot;, she was the black widow waiting in the net that the hapless hero stumbled into. What&#x27;s crucial is that she plays these roles with relish: She seems to enjoy the freedom a script like &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; gives her, and the result is a movie that is not only ingenious and entertaining, but liberating, because we can sense the story isn&#x27;t going to be twisted into conformity with some stupid formula.&quot;

Her performance won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and the London Film Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Actress of the Year, and was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Despite the critical acclaim, because the film was shown on television prior to its cinematic release, Fiorentino was ineligible for an Oscar nomination.

=== Hollywood ===
In a 1994 appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, Fiorentino said she chose to stop acting for a period of time after Warner Bros. executive Mark Canton told her during the filming of &quot;Vision Quest&quot;, &quot;you have a great ass, but I think your jeans need to be tighter.&quot; She said she returned to acting later to pay off mounting credit card debt.

The same year when asked about her newfound fame, and what she would do if she could never act again, Fiorentino told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;You mean I don&#x27;t have to wake up at 5 in the morning and put makeup on? I would be totally fine; I would do something else.&quot; She added she did not have a &quot;driving passion to stay on top. [...] I&#x27;d rather be a little more subdued and aloof in my life.&quot; In a 1985 interview, she also said, “Acting is something you do when you can&#x27;t make up your mind what to do. It really just kind of snuck up on me.”

After &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; Fiorentino next appeared as another &quot;femme fatale&quot; (Anna Katrina Maxwell-Gavin) in the 1995 erotic thriller &quot;Jade&quot;. Fiorentino originally turned the role down because she did not want to play a prostitute, but changed her mind once her character was changed through rewrites. The film was a critical and box-office failure. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Though the combination of Linda Fiorentino, Chazz Palminteri and David Caruso promised &quot;Jade&quot; some fire, it winds up with no more spark than a doused campfire.&quot;

Co-star Michael Biehn was not fond of the film: &quot;Well, on &quot;Jade&quot;, I had no idea what I was doing. I don&#x27;t think anybody had any idea what they were doing. It was a Joe Eszterhas script. To me, none of it ever really made any sense. I didn&#x27;t realize until the read-through that I was the bad guy in it. It was like a jumbled mess. And the movie came out a mess, too. It had great people on it, though. It had William Friedkin directing, it had Chazz Palmenteri, who was nominated that year for an Academy Award, it had Linda Fiorentino, who had just come out with that famous movie she did &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;, and it had David Caruso, who&#x27;s a brilliant actor when given the right material, and a very smart guy. So a great cast, great director... everything but a script.&quot;

In the book &quot;Unlikeable Female Characters: The Women Pop Culture Wants You To Hate&quot;, author Anna Bogutskaya mentions Fiorentino&#x27;s character as meeting criteria for multiple archetypes of negatively portrayed women in popular media. Bogutskaya suggests that the characterization of Anna / Jade contributed to her perception as hard to work with, referencing her personality conflict with Tommy Lee Jones in &quot;Men in Black&quot;, and ultimately culminating in her gradual exit from acting.

She later worked again with Dahl on his film &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (1996). Dahl&#x27;s follow up to &quot;The Last Seduction&quot;, &quot;Unforgettable&quot; was another critical and box-office failure for Fiorentino, only earning less than $3 million in the United States. Reviewer Bryant Frazer gave the film a C− and wrote, &quot;Liotta and Fiorentino look kind of sleepy throughout the whole proceeding ... but still, it has its moments, including the very ending, that really work—as if somewhere, buried inside this mess, there&#x27;s a good movie trying to get out.&quot;

=== &quot;Men in Black&quot;, &quot;Dogma&quot; and career decline ===
Fiorentino played the female lead, Dr. Laurel Weaver, in the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Blockbuster Entertainment&#x27;s Award for Favorite Supporting Actress in Science Fiction. She appeared alongside Ving Rhames, John Leguizamo and David Caruso in the 1998 direct-to-video film &quot;Body Count,&quot; which &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;an after-the-heist road movie that sizzles here and there but ends up going no place special&quot;.&quot;&quot; In 1999, she starred in &quot;Dogma&quot; as abortion clinic employee Bethany Sloane who is tasked with saving the world.

In years following, it was rumored Fiorentino did not get along with director Kevin Smith, which generated negative press for her. In an interview with TV Guide in 2000, Smith stated, “Linda created crisis and trauma and anguish. She created drama while we were making a comedy. She was ticked off that there were other people in the movie who were more famous than she was.” He also accused Fiorentino of avoiding promotional duties after “going nuts” at the film&#x27;s poster, which had spliced her head onto another woman&#x27;s body and amplified her cleavage. “She never did a photo shoot,” Smith said. “It&#x27;s not like we were hinging on all that Fiorentino press – I fought to cast the woman in the movie.&quot;

However, in 2018, Smith stated that rumors of a falling out between the two had been misconstrued and overstated, and that while the two had not spoken in years, they amicably reconnected following his near-fatal heart attack. Blaming himself, Smith attributed the rumors to a remark he had made on the film&#x27;s commentary track, which had later been sensationalized: I remember on a commentary track on the DVD — Janeane Garofalo was in the movie and at one point I said it would have been better if she played the lead, which was a really shitty and stupid thing to say. Thoughtless, considering that Linda was the lead and Linda did a great job. So, it had been years since I had spoken with Linda and I got an email from her. And of course, I was thankful to hear from her and it also gave me a chance to say I&#x27;m so sorry that I ever said that thing years ago. It gives you a chance to make amends. So that was my favorite one. I heard from so many people, but that one really stood out for me because, if somebody had said, ‘Oh, the movie would have been better if [co-star] Ben Affleck directed it,&#x27; that would have hurt my feelings. I know it hurt her feelings and really unnecessarily because I always loved her performance in the movie.After a co-starring role with Paul Newman in the 2000 heist film &quot;Where the Money Is&quot;, and a lead role in the 2002 film &quot;Liberty Stands Still&quot;, Fiorentino&#x27;s career slowed to a halt. She was in talks to star in a series being prepared by Tom Fontana, but did not take the project. Fiorentino was attached to a Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe biographical drama called &quot;Till the End of Time&quot;, but the project stalled when Fiorentino had a falling out with German producer Karel Dirka regarding provocative sex scenes. “You have rights, as an artist and as a woman,” she said. “It&#x27;s not as if I didn&#x27;t agree to do some nudity. But they crossed the line. It was a question of integrity.”

Fiorentino&#x27;s character was written out of &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (2002) to accommodate the return of Tommy Lee Jones as the co-lead of the film and partner to Will Smith&#x27;s character. According to producer Laurie MacDonald, &quot;It turned out not to be a big enough role. We would have loved to have her, but when we began to develop the story, we couldn&#x27;t find a [major] place for her. We always knew that the movie would be about bringing Tommy Lee Jones back.&quot; Kristin Lopez, writing an expose for RogerEbert.com titled &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Difficult Women&quot;, brought up rumors that Jones&#x27; return was in fact contingent upon Fiorentino&#x27;s absence, and that the studio responded to this stipulation accordingly.

In 2007, Fiorentino optioned the rights to a screenplay about Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, with plans to produce and to possibly star in and direct, but the project was dropped. During this period, she was reported to be developing two documentaries, neither of which moved forward. Fiorentino&#x27;s most recent screen role was a supporting character in &quot;Once More with Feeling&quot;, released direct-to-video in 2009.

==Personal life==
Fiorentino married film director and writer John Byrum, whom she had previously worked with on the unfinished movie &quot;The War at Home&quot;, on June 23, 1992. The couple divorced in 1993, after a year of marriage. In an interview with film critic Roger Ebert shortly after &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; came out, Fiorentino admitted that the men she met in real life expected her to be like her devious characters, and said that when it came to the parts that she was offered, “Maybe others see in me what I don&#x27;t necessarily see in myself. And a lot of it in Hollywood has to do with what you look like. I&#x27;m dark and my eyes are dark and my voice is deep, and how the hell could I play a Meg Ryan role, the way I look?”

Fiorentino later had a relationship with Los Angeles private investigator Anthony Pellicano, in the period leading to his 2008 trial and conviction, in Los Angeles, on multiple felony charges. While Pellicano was being investigated, Fiorentino also dated former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Mark Rossini, which law enforcement officials said was her attempt to assist Pellicano&#x27;s defense. According to prosecutors, Fiorentino told Rossini that she was researching a screenplay based on Pellicano&#x27;s case. Rossini conducted searches of government computers for information related to the case and passed the results to Fiorentino, who then handed the files over to Pellicano&#x27;s lawyers in a failed effort to help Pellicano avoid a 15-year prison sentence. Rossini pleaded guilty to illegally accessing FBI computers and resigned from the FBI.

<text>Metiria Leanne Agnes Stanton Turei (born 1970) is a New Zealand academic and former politician. She was a Member of Parliament from 2002 to 2017 and the female co-leader of the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand from 2009 to 2017. Turei resigned from the co-leader position on 9 August 2017 amid a political controversy arising from her admission to lying to the Ministry of Social Development to receive higher payments when she was on the Domestic Purposes Benefit and later, to being enrolled to vote in an electorate where she was not eligible when she was 23. 

She was the Green Party spokesperson on Inequality, Justice, and Building and Housing. She resigned as co-leader of the Green Party and a list candidate immediately prior to the 2017 general election and retired from politics.

==Early years==
Metiria Turei grew up in a working-class Māori family in Palmerston North in the North Island. She is of Ngāti Kahungunu and Āti Hau nui a Pāpārangi descent. She failed her high school examinations and in 1987 she worked her first job as a kitchen-hand at the Hard Rock Café in Palmerston North working the late shift. Between 1989 and 1991, Turei was the &quot;Tumuaki&quot; (&quot;Head&quot;) of Te Iwi Maori Rawakore o Aotearoa and involved with Te Roopu Rawakore o Aotearoa. Turei was a founding member of the Random Trollops performance art troupe. She studied law at the University of Auckland and later worked as a commercial lawyer at Simpson Grierson.

==Political career==
She was a candidate for the McGillicuddy Serious Party in the 1993 election, for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party in the 1996 election and for McGillicuddy Serious again in the 1999 election. In 2001 she stood as the Green Party candidate for Mayor of Auckland, finishing a distant fifth with 2.05% of the vote.

===Member of Parliament===



In the 2002 general election, the Green Party received 7.00% of the vote, which allowed them 9 seats in Parliament. Turei, standing in , was ranked 8th on the Green Party&#x27;s party list, and so entered Parliament as a list MP. When she was elected, Turei left her job as a corporate lawyer for Simpson Grierson to become a Member of Parliament.

She retained her place in Parliament ranked 6th on the Greens&#x27; list in the 2005 election when she stood in .

====2005–2008====
In 2009, Turei&#x27;s Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill received a conscience vote at its first reading, but was defeated 84–34. Later that year, her Liquor Advertising (Television and Radio) Bill was also drawn, but it too was defeated.
In 2008 she was ranked 4th on the Green Party&#x27;s list and stood in the Dunedin North electorate. She lost the election in Dunedin North to Labour&#x27;s Pete Hodgson, finishing third with 11.09% of the vote. However she was returned to parliament due to her high ranking on the Green Party list.

====2008–2011====
On 30 May 2009 Turei was elected as the fourth co-leader (and second female co-leader) of the Green Party. Green Party policy at the time required that there be both a male and a female co-leader. She was elected ahead of veteran MP Sue Bradford.

In July 2009 Turei&#x27;s Marine Animals Protection Law Reform Bill, intended to strengthen protection for dolphins and other marine mammals, was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot. The bill was defeated at its first reading later that month.

In September 2009 Turei led the Green campaign opposing the government&#x27;s plans to allow mining in New Zealand&#x27;s national parks. Her Crown Minerals (Protection of Public Conservation Land Listed in the Fourth Schedule) Amendment Bill, which aimed to strengthen the protection for national parks, was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot in April 2010.

====2011–2014====
In October 2012 her Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 (Application to Casinos) Amendment bill was drawn from the ballot. Before its first reading however, National, ACT and United Future said they would not be voting for it.

Turei, along with the rest of the Green Party, voted in support of Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013, allowing same-sex couples to legally marry in New Zealand.

====2017 general election====

During the 2017 election campaign, Turei publicly stated during an interview on TVNZ&#x27;s Q+A Show that the New Zealand First leader Winston Peters &quot;was on a roll partly because of a very racist approach to immigration.&quot; Her comments triggered fierce criticism from Peters and NZ First Deputy Leader Tracey Martin, who rejected Turei&#x27;s claims and warned that there would be consequences for the Greens in any post-election talks with NZ First. Turei refused to apologise and reiterated that the Greens were still committed to negotiating a coalition deal with NZ First following the election.

On 16 July 2017, during the launch of the Green Party&#x27;s 2017 election campaign, Turei admitted to benefit fraud over a period of three years in the early 1990s, stating that she had not disclosed to Work and Income New Zealand that she was accepting rent from flatmates. Turei justified her action on the grounds that she and her young daughter depended on the Domestic Purposes Benefit to survive. During the campaign, Turei advocated raising the domestic purposes benefit for solo parents and low-income families. Turei&#x27;s disclosure attracted polarising responses from other politicians, the New Zealand media, and blogosphere, and criticism from Social Development Minister Anne Tolley, Labour Party leader Andrew Little, and media commentators Barry Soper and Patrick Gower. The left-wing journalist Chris Trotter and blogger Martyn Bradbury spoke out in support of her, faulting what they considered Work and Income&#x27;s &quot;punitive&quot; treatment of beneficiaries. When the next Colmar Brunton poll came out covering the period 22 to 27 July, the Green vote had surged to 15%, with some of the support coming from Labour which had fallen to 24%. The low ratings caused Little to resign the Labour Party leadership on 1 August.

The right-wing pressure group New Zealand Taxpayers&#x27; Union announced it would invoice her $57,000 in damages but she said it was a political stunt and she would not respond. Some beneficiaries and anti-poverty advocacy groups spoke in support of Turei and she said she had spoken with other beneficiaries who had been withholding information about their benefit status from Work and Income. Turei also advocated an amnesty on beneficiaries, while acknowledging that she had not been aware of an amnesty instituted during the 1990s. On 26 July 2017, Turei announced that she would be meeting with the Ministry of Social Development&#x27;s investigative unit to calculate how much she would pay back in compensation. It was then revealed that in 1993 Turei had been enrolled to vote at the same address as her child&#x27;s father. Turei denied living with the father, which would have disqualified her eligibility for the domestic purposes benefit. She stated that she had enrolled at that address in order to vote for a friend; such conduct constitutes an offence under the Electoral Act.

On 7 August 2017, Green Party MPs David Clendon and Kennedy Graham announced that they were planning to resign as Green Party candidates for the 2017 election, due to the fraud revelations and Turei&#x27;s handling of the resulting situation. Both Clendon and Graham resigned from the party caucus the following day, after the party made moves to remove them.

Turei resigned as co-leader of the Green Party and as a list candidate for the 2017 election on 9 August 2017, saying that the &quot;scrutiny on [her] family has become unbearable.&quot; She stated that her intention was to not return to Parliament after the election. Not being on the list meant that, if she failed to win the electorate of Te Tai Tonga where she was standing, she would not return to Parliament after the election. During August, the Green party fell in opinion polls to around the 5% threshold, below which there wouldn&#x27;t be representation in Parliament, and Labour&#x27;s new leader, Jacinda Ardern, generated such a turnaround that by the end of the month, Labour overtook National in the ratings. In its 26 August edition, the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; summarised the situation as follows:

The media outcry over the case and extensive coverage given to the benefit fraud by the mainstream media in New Zealand has led to claims of political agendas being promoted by the media. Specifically the case has been contrasted with that of Bill English (and the relative lack of media and public &quot;outrage&quot;), and to a lesser extent, that of John Key.

According to &quot;The Spinoff&quot; journalist Madeleine Chapman, Turei&#x27;s resignation had come as a result of Ardern sending two members of her team, rumoured to be Grant Robertson and her chief of staff Neale Jones, to inform Greens co-leader Shaw and his team that Ardern would not be giving Turei a cabinet or ministerial position within a potential Labour government. As a face–saving measure, Turei had organised her own press conference where she announced that she would not ask for a ministerial position in a Labour–led government but would remain co-leader of the Greens until the 2017 election.

During the 2017 election, Turei contested the Te Tai Tonga Māori electorate (which covers Wellington and the entire South Island). She was defeated by Labour&#x27;s candidate Rino Tirikatene and retired from politics.

== Life after politics ==
In October 2018, Metiria Turei gave her first interview since leaving politics. During the interview, she revealed that she is studying art at the Dunedin School of Art, and has work entered in a group show &quot;wā o mua&quot; at the Blue Oyster Art Project Space in Dunedin. Her futurist art collection &quot;tūruapō&quot; was exhibited at The Wallace Arts Centre in Auckland in 2021.

She is currently (2022) a lecturer in law at the University of Otago.

==Personal life==
Metiria Turei has a daughter, Piupiu Turei, and is married to Warwick Stanton. In February 2014, Turei and her husband were living in Waitati, close to the shore of Blueskin Bay, a coastal estuary to the north of Dunedin. She is also a performing arts enthusiast and participated in a performing group called Random Trollops and medieval reenactments at her Blueskin Bay home. Turei also wore Adrienne Winkelmann jackets, which elicited criticism from several National Party MPs including Judith Collins.

<doc id="659715" wikidata="Q17092748" url="?curid=659715" title="The Road to Wellville">
<text>The Road to Wellville is a 1993 novel by American author T. C. Boyle. Set in Battle Creek, Michigan, during the early days of breakfast cereals, the story includes a historical fictionalization of John Harvey Kellogg, the inventor of corn flakes.

The title comes from an actual booklet called &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; written by C. W. Post, a former patient at the sanitarium who was inspired by his diet there to found his own cereal business and become a major competitor to the Kelloggs. Post used to give out his booklet in boxes of Grape-Nuts cereal. In the novel, the character Will Lightbody brings up this phrase and incurs Kellogg&#x27;s wrath.

&quot;The Road to Wellville&quot; was adapted into a movie in 1994, directed by Alan Parker and starring Anthony Hopkins (as John Harvey Kellogg), Bridget Fonda, Matthew Broderick, John Cusack, Michael Lerner, Dana Carvey (as George Kellogg), Lara Flynn Boyle, John Neville, Colm Meaney, Camryn Manheim, and Monica Parker. The northeast US scenes were primarily filmed at Mohonk Mountain House, an historic stick-frame hotel in New Paltz, New York.

==Plot==
The book&#x27;s plot details three narratives which take place between November 1907 and late May 1908 in John Harvey Kellogg&#x27;s Battle Creek, Michigan sanitarium. The first thread concerns Will and Eleanor Lightbody. Eleanor, a fan of Dr. Kellogg, drags Will to Kellogg&#x27;s sanitarium. Will has recently suffered stomach pains and is still recovering from bouts of alcohol and drug addiction—the latter at the hands of his wife. Eleanor suffered a brutal miscarriage, which has left her physically weak. Hoping to improve his marriage, Will goes along but is constantly filled with doubts about Kellogg&#x27;s health methods. While he takes part in the therapy, he gags at health food, does not enjoy the laughing therapy, and watches as his friend Homer Praetz is electrocuted during a sinusoidal bath. Meanwhile, his wife Eleanor finds too much enjoyment at the sanitarium, especially at the hands of Dr. Spitzvogel, a doctor who practices &quot;Die Handhabung Therapeutik&quot;—or in common parlance, erotic massage.

Charlie Ossining, a peripatetic merchant, attempts to market a new type of cereal, &quot;Per-Fo&quot;, with a partner Bender, whose slick and untrustworthy behavior disarms him. They join forces with George Kellogg, adopted son of John Harvey Kellogg, who has had a falling out with his father and seeks revenge. George agrees to use his name on &quot;Per-Fo&quot; in the hopes the cereal will be bought out by the Kellogg&#x27;s Company.

John Harvey Kellogg, a doctor fond of health food and what would now be called alternative medicine, inserts himself into the life of each character, whether as health guru to Eleanor, competitor to Charlie and Bender, or torturer of Will. His attempts at untested health cures, such as radium treatments, are comically tragic. As the sanitarium unravels, and son George becomes increasingly angry, father and &quot;master of all&quot; John must assert his control and keep his institution afloat.

<doc id="659719" wikidata="Q183027" url="?curid=659719" title="Mount Garibaldi">
<text>Mount Garibaldi (, ) is a dormant stratovolcano in the Garibaldi Ranges of the Pacific Ranges in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. It has a maximum elevation of and rises above the surrounding landscape on the east side of the Cheakamus River in New Westminster Land District. In addition to the main peak, Mount Garibaldi has two named sub-peaks. Atwell Peak is a sharp, conical peak slightly higher than the more rounded peak of Dalton Dome. Both were volcanically active at different times throughout Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s eruptive history. The northern and eastern flanks of Mount Garibaldi are obscured by the Garibaldi Névé, a large snowfield containing several radiating glaciers. Flowing from the steep western face of Mount Garibaldi is the Cheekye River, a tributary of the Cheakamus River. Opal Cone on the southeastern flank is a small volcanic cone from which a lengthy lava flow descends. The western face is a landslide feature that formed in a series of collapses between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago. These collapses resulted in the formation of a large debris flow deposit that fans out into the Squamish Valley.

Mount Garibaldi has been the focus of intermittent volcanic activity over the last 260,000 years. This activity produced mostly dacite, the main type of volcanic rock forming Mount Garibaldi. Volcanism between 260,000 and 220,000 years ago constructed an ancestral cone that was subsequently destroyed. Another growth period began with the eruption of Atwell Peak about 13,000 years ago when Mount Garibaldi was surrounded by an ice sheet during the last glacial period. The latest period of volcanic activity took place about 10,000 years ago with eruptions from Dalton Dome and Opal Cone after the ice sheet retreated. Although the mountain is not known to have been volcanically active since that time, it could erupt again, which could endanger the nearby populace. If this were to happen, relief efforts could be organized by teams such as the Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan who are prepared to notify people threatened by volcanic eruptions in Canada.

The area surrounding Mount Garibaldi has been inhabited by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Their oral history includes a story of the mountain and a great flood. The non-indigenous name of the mountain was given by George Henry Richards in 1860 in honour of the Italian patriot and soldier Giuseppe Garibaldi. Several mountaineers had climbed Mount Garibaldi by the early 1900s, some of whom were members of mountaineering clubs. A plane operated by Pacific Western Airlines crashed on the slopes of Mount Garibaldi in 1953; all five people aboard were killed. The construction of a ski resort was begun in the late 1960s, but developments were halted in 1969 due to financial difficulties. Several climbing routes ascend the flanks of Mount Garibaldi and involve traversing glaciers, snow slopes or loose rock. Mountain climbing hazards include crevasses, avalanches and rockfalls. Access to Mount Garibaldi is via hiking trails from Alice Ridge, Brohm Ridge, and the Diamond Head parking lot at the end of Garibaldi Park Road.

==Geography==
===Background===
Mount Garibaldi is located on the east side of the Cheakamus River between Squamish and Whistler in New Westminster Land District. It lies within the Pacific Ranges Ecoregion, a mountainous region of the southern Coast Mountains characterized by high, steep and rugged mountains made of granitic rocks. Much of this ecoregion encompasses the Pacific Ranges in southwestern British Columbia, although it also includes the northwesternmost portion of the Cascade Range in Washington state. Several coastal islands, channels and fjords occur along the western margin of the Pacific Ranges Ecoregion. The Pacific Ranges Ecoregion is part of the Coast and Mountains Ecoprovince which forms part of the Humid Maritime and Highlands Ecodivision.
The Pacific Ranges Ecoregion is subdivided into seven ecosections, the Eastern Pacific Ranges Ecosection being the main ecosection at Mount Garibaldi. This ecosection is characterized by a rugged landscape of mountains that increase in elevation from south to north; the northern summits contain large icefields. A transitional climate between coastal maritime and interior continental climates dominates the Eastern Pacific Ranges Ecosection. It is characterized by little precipitation and mild temperatures due to air from the Pacific Ocean often passing over this area. During winter, cold Arctic air invades from the Central Interior, resulting in extreme cloud cover and snow. A number of other volcanoes are situated within the Eastern Pacific Ranges Ecosection. This includes Mount Cayley, which lies in the Squamish River watershed, and Mount Meager, which lies near the headwaters of the Lillooet River.

Several rivers flow through the Eastern Pacific Ranges Ecosection, including the Fraser and Coquihalla rivers on its eastern side, the Cheakamus, Squamish and Elaho rivers on its western side and the Lillooet River lying in the middle. Coastal western hemlock forests dominate nearly all the valleys and lower slopes of this ecosection, the upper slopes containing subalpine mountain hemlock forests and, to a lesser extent, Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir forests. Alpine vegetation lies just above the subalpine forests, which is normally overlain by barren rock. Wildlife such as grey jays, chipmunks, squirrels, flickers, Columbian black tailed deer, mountain goats, wolverines, cougars and grizzly and black bears are locally present. The communities of Whistler, Pemberton, Mount Currie, Hope and Yale are situated within the Eastern Pacific Ranges Ecosection, all of which are connected to the Lower Mainland by a network of highways.

===Subfeatures===

The northern and eastern flanks of Mount Garibaldi are covered by the Garibaldi Névé, the main glacial feature at the volcano. Several individually named outlet glaciers drain the Garibaldi Névé. These include Garibaldi Glacier northwest of Opal Cone, North Pitt Glacier on the northeastern face of Mount Garibaldi, South Pitt Glacier southeast of Glacier Pikes, Lava Glacier west of Mamquam Lake, Sentinel Glacier southeast of Garibaldi Lake, Warren Glacier at the headwaters of Culiton Creek, Bishop Glacier south of the head of the Pitt River, Phoenix Glacier south of Deception Peak and Pike Glacier east of Glacier Pikes. The Garibaldi and Lava glaciers issue from the south side of the Garibaldi Névé, sending their muddy waters to the Mamquam River. Immediately to the north of Mount Garibaldi and directly below its northern face, the Warren Glacier flows towards the Cheakamus River. The Garibaldi Névé and its outlet glaciers have a combined area of about . Other glaciers on Mount Garibaldi include Cheekye Glacier south of the summit and Diamond Glacier between Atwell Peak and Diamond Head. Although the glaciers at times have seen surges reaching further down slope, a 2009 study published in the &quot;Global and Planetary Change&quot; journal found that they overall have been progressively retreating since the early 1900s. A study conducted by the University of British Columbia in 2015 determined that 70% of all the glacial ice in Canada would be melted away by the year 2100. However, observations of the nearby Helm Glacier and other glaciers throughout Canada in 2022 suggest that the 2015 estimate may be an underestimation.

Mount Garibaldi contains a number of individually named peaks. Atwell Peak is a conical plug dome in elevation. It is named after Atwell Duncan Francis Joseph King, an ardent mountaineer who led the first ascent of Mount Garibaldi in 1907. Atwell Peak contains sharp and exposed ridges, as well as steep and loose faces that are prone to avalanching. Dalton Dome is a blunt summit named after Arthur Tinniswood Dalton. Dalton was a Vancouver architect, city assessor and mountaineer who took part in the first ascent of Mount Garibaldi. The eastern side of Mount Garibaldi contains a peak known as The Tent. Opal Cone on the southeastern flank of Mount Garibaldi is a parasitic cone near the south side of Garibaldi Glacier. A spur known as The Sharkin separates the Warren and North Pitt glaciers on the northeast side of Mount Garibaldi. Diamond Head is a subsidiary peak on the south side of Mount Garibaldi named for its resemblance to Diamond Head in Hawaii.

Mount Garibaldi lies within the Squamish River watershed. Its steep western face is the source of the Cheekye River which drains a small but steep catchment on its western flank that covers an area of . The Cheekye River flows west into the Cheakamus River which flows south and southwest into the Squamish River. Cheekye is a Squamish name meaning &quot;strong rushing water&quot;. Ring Creek originates from the Bishop and Diamond glaciers on Mount Garibaldi. It flows west and southwest into the Mamquam River which flows west and south into the mouth of the Squamish River. Zig Zag Creek drains Lava Glacier and flows southeast into Skookum Creek. The Pitt River also originates at Mount Garibaldi and flows southwest from the North Pitt and South Pitt glaciers into the Fraser River.

==Geology==

Mount Garibaldi is one of the three principal volcanoes in the southern segment of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, the other two being Mount Price and The Black Tusk. It represents the largest volcano in the combined Mount Garibaldi–Garibaldi Lake volcanic field, which encompasses of volcanic material. This volcanic field consists of at least twelve eruptive centres that are in the form of stratovolcanoes, lava domes, cinder cones and subglacial volcanoes. These include Mount Price, The Black Tusk, The Table, Cinder Cone and Round Mountain, all of which formed in the last 1.3 million years. The Mount Garibaldi–Garibaldi Lake volcanic field is normally separated into the Mount Garibaldi and Garibaldi Lake volcanic fields on the basis of differing magmatic chemistry. The Mount Garibaldi lavas are hypersthene-normative hawaiites and nepheline-normative mugearite with subordinate olivine tholeiites whereas the Garibaldi Lake lavas are calc-alkaline basaltic andesites through rhyolite.

Like other volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, Mount Garibaldi formed as a result of subduction zone volcanism. As the Juan de Fuca Plate thrusts under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone, it forms volcanoes and volcanic eruptions. Unlike most subduction zones worldwide, there is no deep oceanic trench along the continental margin of Cascadia. There is also very little seismic evidence that the Juan de Fuca Plate is actively subducting. The probable explanation lies in the rate of convergence between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates. These two tectonic plates currently converge at a rate of per year, only about half the rate of convergence from seven million years ago. This slowed convergence likely accounts for reduced seismicity and the lack of an oceanic trench. The best evidence for ongoing subduction is the existence of active volcanism in the Cascade Volcanic Arc.

===Structure===

Mount Garibaldi is a moderately eroded stratovolcano overlooking the town of Squamish at the head of Howe Sound north of Vancouver. It is one of the three Cascade Arc volcanoes made exclusively of dacite, the other two being Glacier Peak and Mount Cayley. Rhyodacite is also a common volcanic rock at Mount Garibaldi and Mount Cayley, although high-silica rhyolite is uniquely present at Mount Garibaldi. Subordinate andesite erupted at all three volcanoes relatively early in their histories. At Mount Garibaldi, the total volume of volcanic rocks amount to and represent many episodes of activity spanning from about 670,000 years ago to the Holocene. Andesite-dacite lavas and their pyroclastic accompaniments from several vents initially filled paleovalleys glacially incised into the Coast Plutonic Complex basement. Several dacitic domes and derivative pyroclastic material then built the main volcanic edifice starting about 260,000 years ago. Much of the volcano was rebuilt in the last 50,000 years by a series of violent eruptions similar in character to the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée. The modern volcanic edifice is a volcano, having been partially constructed over glacial ice during the Pleistocene epoch.
Like many other stratovolcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, Mount Garibaldi stands out by itself above the surrounding landscape. This is in contrast to most other volcanoes in the Coast Mountains, which are hidden within higher subranges. The mountain has a proximal relief of , a draping relief of , an elevation of and a height of . With a length of and a width of , Mount Garibaldi is one of the larger volcanoes in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. The western side of the mountain contains a scarp exposing its internal structure. This scarp formed as a result of collapse of the western flank which produced a debris flow deposit in the Squamish Valley called the Cheekye Fan. At the time of its formation, the Cheekye Fan extended across Howe Sound, resulting in the impoundment of a freshwater lake upstream of the fan. The Squamish River subsequently built a delta into this lake during the Holocene. It then filled in the lake with sediment over the last 3,300 years to create the Squamish River floodplain.

Mount Garibaldi is bounded by Brohm Ridge on the northwest and by Alice Ridge on the southwest. Extending from the southern flank of Mount Garibaldi is the unusually long Ring Creek lava flow. It is dacitic in composition, attains a length of approximately and contains well-defined levees along its margins. The emplacement of the Ring Creek lava flow altered drainage patterns along a valley bottom downstream, causing Skookum Creek and the Mamquam River to follow the southern margin of the lava flow and Ring Creek to follow along the northern margin. Sediments eroded from the Ring Creek lava flow form an alluvial fan at the Mamquam River and Skookum Creek confluence. The western slopes of Mount Garibaldi are underlain by sheared and altered quartz diorite, which has undergone stream and glacial erosion to form rugged topography with relief up to .

===Volcanic history===

At least three stages of eruptive activity contributed to the formation of Mount Garibaldi. The initial Cheekye stage took place between 260,000 and 220,000 years ago with the eruption of dacite and breccia, resulting in the formation of a broad composite cone. Parts of this &quot;proto-Garibaldi&quot; or ancestral volcano are exposed on Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s lower northern and eastern flanks and on the upper of Brohm Ridge. Around where Columnar Peak and possibly Glacier Pikes are now located, several coalescing dacitic domes were constructed. Dacite from the western end of Alice Ridge, from Columnar Peak and from Mount Garibaldi have K–Ar ages of 260,000 ± 160,000 years, 220,000 ± 220,000 years and 260,000 ± 130,000 years, respectively. During the ensuing long period of dormancy, the Cheekye River cut a deep valley into the cone&#x27;s western flank which was later filled with the Fraser ice sheet.

After reaching its maximum extent, the Fraser ice sheet was covered with volcanic ash and fragmented debris from the Atwell Peak stage. This period of growth began about 13,000 years ago with the eruption of the Atwell Peak plug dome from a ridge surrounded by the ice sheet. As the plug dome rose, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as talus down its sides. Several pyroclastic flows generated by Peléan eruptions accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a fragmental cone with an overall slope of 12–15 degrees; erosion has since steepened this slope. Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small lake against Brohm Ridge&#x27;s southern arm. The volcanic sandstones seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake.
Glacial overlap was most significant on the west and somewhat to the south. Subsequent melting of the ice sheet and its component glaciers removed support from the western flank of Mount Garibaldi, resulting in a series of landslides between 12,800 and 11,500 years ago that moved nearly half of the volcano&#x27;s volume into the Squamish Valley. This catastrophic collapse produced the Cheekye Fan and the scarp exposing the internal structure of Mount Garibaldi. Soon before or after the buried ice had melted away, the Dalton Dome stage commenced with the eruption of dacite lava down Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s north and northeastern flanks. Another dacite flow issued from Dalton Dome shortly after the ice sheet had receded, having travelled down the landslide scarp on Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s western flank. Possibly contemporaneous volcanism occurred at Opal Cone with the eruption of the voluminous Ring Creek lava flow between 10,700 and 9,300 years ago. This represents the latest known eruptive event at Mount Garibaldi and the volcano is now considered to be dormant.

At least two debris flows in the order of occurred at Mount Garibaldi in the 1930s and 1950s, both of which swept down the Cheekye River. The 1950s debris flow was caused by heavy rains and reached the Cheakamus River where it formed a temporary landslide dam. This is the latest debris flow to reach the Cheakamus River from the Cheekye basin. In contrast to Mount Cayley and Mount Meager, no hot springs are known in the Garibaldi area. However, there is evidence of anomalously high heat flow in Table Meadows and elsewhere. At least three seismic events have occurred at Mount Garibaldi since 1985, indicating that the volcano is potentially active and poses a significant hazard to the area.

===Volcanic hazards===
Mount Garibaldi is one of two volcanoes in Canada classified as a very high threat by Natural Resources Canada, the other volcano being Mount Meager to the northwest. Although Plinian eruptions have not been identified at Mount Garibaldi, Peléan eruptions can also produce large amounts of volcanic ash that could significantly affect the nearby communities of Whistler and Squamish. Peléan eruptions might cause short and long term water supply problems for the city of Vancouver and most of the Lower Mainland. The catchment area for the Greater Vancouver watershed is downwind from Mount Garibaldi. An eruption producing floods and lahars could destroy parts of Highway 99, threaten communities such as Brackendale and endanger water supplies from Pitt Lake. Fisheries on the Pitt River would also be at risk. Mount Garibaldi is also close to a major air traffic route; volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. These volcanic hazards become more serious as the Lower Mainland grows in population.

At the head of the Cheekye River are several fractures and linear scarps that face up-slope. These features, referred to as the Cheekye linears, occur in pyroclastic rocks and interbedded andesitic and dacitic flows on the slopes of Brohm and Alice ridges. They may have formed as a result of sliding of this volcanic sequence along its contact with the underlying basement rocks. As a result, the Cheekye linears pose potential landslide hazards to Brackendale and several Squamish Nation villages nearby. The danger of catastrophic landslides from Mount Garibaldi has restricted development on the Cheekye Fan. In 2018, a major development on the Cheekye Fan was approved by Squamish council. The project included 537 single-family units, 678 multi-unit dwellings and a $45 million debris flow barrier to prevent a large landslide from reaching the Cheekye Fan.

Because dacite is the main type of lava erupted from Mount Garibaldi, lava flows are a low to moderate hazard. Dacite is felsic in composition, containing 62–69% silica content. This high percentage in silica content increases the viscosity of dacitic melts relative to that of andesite or basalt, generally resulting in the formation of steep-sided lava domes and stubby lava flows. An exception is the Ring Creek dacite flow from Opal Cone, a length that is normally attained by basaltic lava flows.

===Monitoring===
Like other volcanoes in Canada, Mount Garibaldi is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain its activity level. The Canadian National Seismograph Network has been established to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, but it is too far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the mountain. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if Mount Garibaldi becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If Mount Garibaldi were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.

==Human history==
===Indigenous peoples===

To the Squamish people, the local indigenous people of this area, Mount Garibaldi is called Nch&#x27;ḵay̓ (). In their language it means &quot;Dirty Place&quot;, referring to the muddy waters of the Cheekye River. Mount Garibaldi is considered sacred to the Squamish people as it is an important part of their history. In their oral history, they passed down a story of the great flood that covered their land after the last ice age. During the flood, Mount Garibaldi was only one of two mountains that peaked over the water. The Squamish people headed for Mount Garibaldi and latched their canoes to the mountain with a rope made from woven cedar bark in order to prevent being swept away. As the flood waters started to recede, a large lake was formed and the Squamish people returned to their home site in Squamish.

Mount Garibaldi is the largest volcano in Squamish Nation territory. An obsidian outcrop on the southeastern flank of Mount Garibaldi is said by the Squamish people to have been created by the thunderbird, a legendary creature in some North American indigenous peoples&#x27; history and culture. During battles, the thunderbird helped the Squamish people fight against evil by shooting lightning from its eyes and creating powerful winds and thunder with its wings. The obsidian outcrop is where lightning from the thunderbird&#x27;s eyes struck ground. Garibaldi obsidian was used to create tools due to its ability to form sharp edges, but its quality is poor compared to other obsidian sources in British Columbia. Pieces of Garibaldi obsidian are distributed in the Strait of Georgia where they occur in archaeological sites as early as 4,500 years old.

===Later history===
Mount Garibaldi was witnessed by George Henry Richards in 1860 while surveying Howe Sound on board the Royal Navy ship HMS &quot;Plumper&quot;. Richards named the mountain that year after Giuseppe Garibaldi, an Italian patriot and soldier who in 1860 had succeeded in unifying Italy by patriating Sicily and Naples. The first ascent of Mount Garibaldi was made by Vancouver mountaineers Gordon B. Warren, Arthur Tinniswood Dalton, Tom C. Pattison, William Tinniswood Dalton, James John Trorey and Atwell Duncan King on August 11, 1907. This mountaineering party had recognized the volcanic origin of the mountain. Another party led by A. T. Dalton ascended the main peak and dome of Mount Garibaldi by a new and better route in 1908. This was followed by an ascent to the summit in 1910 by members of the Alpine Club of Canada and a local mountaineering club. Party members included A. Morkill, B. S. Darling, A. Cawdry, W. G. Barker, A. J. Armistead and Mr. Wedgwood. A party consisting of 13 members of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club ascended Mount Garibaldi from the southeast face on August 13, 1911. The first women to attain the summit of Mount Garibaldi were Vancouver climbers Pansy Munday and L. C. Hanafin on July 16, 1913. They ascended the west face of Mount Garibaldi by approaching from the southwest, which involved traversing along the Mamquam River and then climbing Round Mountain and The Gargoyles. Hanafin and Munday also climbed neighbouring Mamquam Mountain during the same expedition.
The first United States party to climb Mount Garibaldi consisted of 13 members of The Mountaineers in August 1923. It included Norman Huber of Saint Paul, Minnesota; Paul Hugdahl, Paul Gooding and C. A. Fisher of Bellingham, Washington; C. A. Garner, Amos Hard and A. H. Denman of Tacoma, Washington; Edmond S. Meany, George Hise, Lars Loveseth, Ben F. Mooers, Joseph T. Hazard and Fred Fenton of Seattle, Washington. The leader of the climbing party, Joseph T. Hazard, stated that &quot;while a little less than 9,000 feet high, Mount Garibaldi is much more difficult of ascent than any of the major peaks of Washington&quot;. In 1927, Mount Garibaldi was incorporated into the newly formed, Garibaldi Provincial Park. This mountainous Class A provincial park was named after Mount Garibaldi and contains a number of other volcanoes, including Mount Price, Cinder Cone, The Black Tusk and The Table. Despite being the namesake of Garibaldi Provincial Park, Mount Garibaldi is not its highest mountain.

On October 19, 1953, a plane operated by Pacific Western Airlines crashed on the slopes of Mount Garibaldi, killing all five people aboard. The plane was on a mercy flight from Gunn Lake to Vancouver at the time of the accident. Passengers involved in the crash were Lawrence Hamilton of the Pioneer mines, Ernest Maple of Gold Bridge, nurse Lucille Warden, pilot Bob Drinkwater and stretcher passenger Joseph Neumeyer, the latter being an injured miner who was being rushed to a hospital in Vancouver. The smashed plane and deceased passengers were found by a ground search party on October 20. This was followed by removal of the passengers from the wreckage on October 21. Post-accident investigation could not determine the cause of the crash.

Vancouver teachers Christopher Clifford Harris, 33, and Margo Anne Fowler, 26, got married on the summit of Mount Garibaldi on April 14, 1973, to express their passion for mountain climbing. The couple managed to get to the nearly inaccessible, summit by helicopter. They wore traditional mountaineering garb for their wedding. According to Harris, &quot;You can see snow and mountain tops forever. Even Mount Baker, and that&#x27;s 100 miles away.&quot;

===Ski resort development===
A multi-million dollar ski resort, Mount Garibaldi Glacier Resorts, was to be built on Brohm Ridge in the late 1960s. It was designed by West Vancouver resident Adi Bauer in 1954 to feature a luxury lodge, three Swiss-style chalets and the world&#x27;s longest gondola lift. Access to the ski resort was to be by helicopter or snowshoes in winter, although a rough road winding up the ridge to the ski resort lodge was to provide four-wheel drive access in summer. The ski resort was to open in the winter of 1970, but financial difficulties in 1969 halted all developments. In January 1970, the three Swiss-style chalets remained unfinished, the gondola lift consisted only of towers with no lift cables, and the gondola cars were stored in another building at the foot of Mount Garibaldi.

In 1978, the Government of British Columbia invited California-based developer Wolfgang Richter to salvage the failed Mount Garibaldi Glacier Resorts project. Richter&#x27;s plans were postponed by the early 1980s recession and his proposal was denied by the Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks in 1991, saying it &quot;did not make economic sense&quot;. The ski resort proposed by Richter would have operated as a day-use area and would have featured an almost vertical drop. Such a drop would have been greater than those of the Cypress, Manning and Mount Seymour provincial park ski resorts, but still shorter than the one in Whistler Blackcomb. A total of 15,000 skiers would have been spread across of skiable terrain per day. Accommodation would have been provided by a mid-mountain village and an upper village at elevations of , respectively.

==Recreation facilities==

Overlooking the Tantalus Range is the Brohm Ridge Chalet, a three-story European-style lodge built in the 1960s as part of the attempted ski resort development. It is now operated by the Black Tusk Snowmobile Club, a non-profit organization founded in 1971 in the community of Squamish. The Brohm Ridge Chalet sleeps a total of 40 people whilst the nearby Black Tusk Snowmobile Clubhouse sleeps a further 14.

A BC Parks shelter at the Elfin Lakes offers overnight stays and can sleep up to 33 people. It is equipped with a propane heater, a wash sink, pit toilet facilities, propane lights, two propane hot plates and four picnic tables. The Elfin Lakes Campground offers a day-use shelter, hang storage facilities, pit toilet facilities, two outdoor picnic tables, four indoor picnic tables and 35 tent platforms.

The Rampart Ponds Campground, located northeast of the Elfin Lakes shelter, offers food storage facilities, pit toilet facilities and 12 tent platforms.

==Accessibility==
Mamquam Road, north of downtown Squamish, provides access to Mount Garibaldi from Highway 99. This easterly paved road traverses the Squamish Golf and Country Club and then heads north through Quest University. Mamquam Road then extends northeast and becomes Garibaldi Park Road. At the end of Garibaldi Park Road is the Diamond Head parking lot, which lies from Highway 99 at an elevation of . The Diamond Head hiking trail commences from the parking lot to the Elfin Lakes where Opal Cone, Columnar Peak, The Gargoyles and Mamquam Icefield can be viewed. A hiking trail extending from the Elfin Lakes leads down to Ring Creek then climbs Opal Cone where Mamquam Lake and the Garibaldi Névé can be viewed from its summit. The route to the Garibaldi Névé on Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s eastern flank is marked by cairns.

An alternative approach to Mount Garibaldi is via Alice Ridge, which can be accessed from Highway 99 to Alice Lake Provincial Park where jeep roads switchback up onto the ridge. The saddle dividing Diamond Head and The Gargoyles is then traversed northeasterly on a trail to the Garibaldi Névé. It is also possible to access Mount Garibaldi from Brohm Ridge. An unmarked road just before Brohm Lake and north of the Alice Lake Provincial Park turnoff extends southward from Highway 99 towards Cat Lake. About down the road is a gate that is locked at 5 p.m. on Friday evenings and not reopened until Sunday evenings. After the gate has been passed, the road heads eastward and switchbacks up the southwestern slope of Brohm Ridge. It then passes the abandoned ski area on top of the ridge before terminating. From the road&#x27;s end, Brohm Ridge is hiked to the Garibaldi Névé.

==Climbing and skiing==

Mountain climbing on Mount Garibaldi is done in winter when the loose volcanic rocks comprising the mountain are frozen in place by snow and ice. Most climbing routes are confined to the glaciers and snow slopes, which are abundant in winter and spring. They require climbers to possess some level of climbing skill; their grades and classes range from II-to-V and 2-to-5 on the Yosemite Decimal System, respectively. Ski camping on the Garibaldi Névé is common in winter, but high winds are not unusual. Therefore, most winter skiers and climbers wisely protect campsites by digging into the snow or constructing snow walls or igloos for shelter.

The Garibaldi Névé is a common ski destination, particularly in spring, and provides open access to many of the climbing routes. In later season, skiing across the névé is possible, but not much easier than walking. Skis are rarely used by June or July when most ascents are made. The glaciers and snow slopes of Mount Garibaldi become boggy and then normally melt away after June or July in most years. In contrast, the Garibaldi Névé provides open access to several climbing routes until late summer.

===Dangers and accidents===
Bergschrunds and other crevasses can pose difficulty and danger in late spring or summer when snow and ice has melted away. Rockfalls and loose rock are ever-present hazards at this time of the year; rocks regularly rumble down Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s flanks without apparent provocation. For this reason, early-season, cold-weather snow ascents are recommended for most routes up Mount Garibaldi. However, at least some of these routes can have high avalanche danger in winter and spring, making rockfalls and avalanches ever-present hazards throughout the year.
In April 1950, Vancouver photographer Otto E. Landauer fractured a leg when a ski broke while skiing on Mount Garibaldi. It was Landauer&#x27;s first accident as an expert skier, having occurred as the 46-year-old neared Diamond Head Lodge. Landauer was brought down Mount Garibaldi by a party of 25 holidayers at Diamond Head Lodge and then transferred to a light truck which took him to Squamish via logging road. The 46-hour rescue operation ended on April 11 when a speedboat waiting at Squamish brought Landauer to St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital in Vancouver.

Frank de Bruyn, a 16-year-old mountain climber from Vancouver, was killed by a small avalanche near the snow-covered summit of Mount Garibaldi on July 19, 1961. De Bruyn was one of three youths climbing Mount Garibaldi, the other two being 18-year-olds James Hebden and James Fowler. Hebden got caught in the edge of the avalanche and was sent to the Squamish General Hospital after sustaining a lung injury. Fowler escaped injury, but underwent shock treatment the next day after stumbling down the mountainside with word of the accident.

Vancouver mountaineers Lloyd Williams, 26, Heinz Rostek, 22, and Don Hoover, 22, were trapped on Mount Garibaldi for four days in April 1963. The trio left the Diamond Head chalet on April 11 for a skiing trip around Mount Garibaldi to Garibaldi Lake where they were to meet another group of skiers on April 14. They became trapped by a blizzard on the level of Mount Garibaldi on April 13 where the three men set up a camp. The trio remained at the camp until April 17 when the weather cleared. Fresh ski marks left by the three mountaineers were spotted that morning by ground searchers and a Royal Canadian Air Force helicopter found the trio at noon.

===Climbing routes===
====Garibaldi Peak routes====
The normal route up Mount Garibaldi is the East Face Route (grade II and class 3–4). It is normally approached via Garibaldi Névé or Elfin Lakes, although it can also be approached via Alice Ridge. This route crosses the Garibaldi Névé and ascends toward the Garibaldi–Atwell saddle west of The Tent where crevasses in the icefall can sometimes make traversing difficult. There is also the danger of avalanches during ripe snow conditions. A more common and less crevassed approach is via Diamond Glacier to a saddle in the moraine ridge at the foot of Atwell Peak&#x27;s southeast buttress. Once the saddle has been climbed by ascending a final steep slope, the rocky summit of Mount Garibaldi is reached by proceeding up Cheekye Glacier.

The Northeast Face Route (grade II and class 3–4) is a straightforward glacier ascent crossing the Warren Glacier. It ascends moderate snow and glacier slopes of the northeast face then approaches the headwall where a bergschrund is crossed with potential difficulty. Broken rock or snow is then ascended to the summit. This route is often traversed on skis by parties travelling over the Garibaldi Névé. The area below the summit pinnacle is exposed to rockfall and is moderately prone to avalanching.

====Atwell Peak routes====

Two considerably more challenging and objectively dangerous routes run up the northwest face of Atwell Peak. The first route, referred to as the Armenian Express (grade V and class 4–5), involves climbing the major couloir on the far right of the northwest face. This couloir is ascended until loose rock forces a traverse onto the south ridge just below the summit. The second route is the Siberian Express (grade V and class 4–5) and ascends the huge central couloir just north of the summit of Atwell Peak. It leads directly to the summit ridge over moderately sloping snow and ice with a very steep finish. Both the Armenian and Siberian expresses are exposed to rockfall and have high avalanche danger. For this reason, these routes are mainly climbed in winter when they are well-frozen and contain stable snow.

The normal route up Atwell Peak is the North Ridge Route (grade III and class 4–5). It is a straightforward ascent up the short, exposed and shattered ridge to Atwell&#x27;s summit from the Garibaldi–Atwell saddle, which can be reached via the East Face Route. The north ridge is alpine in character, featuring steep slopes and very loose rock. Ascents are commonly made in winter when hazards such as avalanches and snow cornices exist all along the ridge.

The South Arête Route (grade IV and class 4–5) is a technical climbing route ascending a highly exposed arête that divides the southeast and southwest faces of Atwell Peak. It leads directly to Atwell&#x27;s summit, climbing steep terrain throughout its entirety. The route is generally ascended during winter when in optimal condition. Hazards include snow cornices as well as unprotected climbing on loose rock and rime ice.

The Southeast Face Routes (grade II and class 3–4) are approached via Alice Ridge or Elfin Lakes to Diamond Glacier. They ascend couloirs in steep shattered rock, one of which offers a direct climb to a point immediately south of Atwell&#x27;s summit. The routes offer a straightforward snow and ice climb in winter when the couloirs are covered with stable snow and iced over with rocks frozen in place. Hazards include snow cornices lining the summit ridge in winter, as well as avalanches and rockfalls in less than optimal conditions.

====Dalton Dome routes====
At least three routes run up Mount Garibaldi to Dalton Dome, none of which are commonly climbed due to extremely poor quality rock. The most direct independent summit route to Dalton Dome is the Northwest Shoulder Route (grade II and class 4), which is approached via Brohm Ridge to the base of Mount Garibaldi&#x27;s northwest shoulder. It involves climbing snow or loose rock up the shoulder to the summit ridge.

The Southwest Ridge Route (grade III and class 3–4) is mainly climbed in winter when conditions are favorable. It is approached via a snow or scree traverse from Brohm Ridge below the west face of Mount Garibaldi where the southwest ridge is ascended to the summit.

Ascending the Warren Glacier headwall on the far right side is the North Face Route (grade III and class 4–5). It climbs steep snow and remarkably unstable rock to a small escarpment that gains the northwest shoulder, which then leads to Dalton Dome&#x27;s summit.

<text>Copenhagen Business School (Danish&quot;: Handelshøjskolen i København&quot;) often abbreviated and referred to as CBS (also in Danish), is a public university situated in Copenhagen, Denmark and is considered one of the most prestigious business schools in Western Europe and the world.

CBS was established in 1917 by the Danish Society for the Advancement of Business Education and Research (FUHU); however, it was not until 1920 that accounting became the first full study programme at CBS. Today CBS has approximately 20,000 students and 2,000 employees, and offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate programmes within business, typically with an interdisciplinary and international focus. CBS is accredited by EQUIS (European Quality Improvement System), AMBA (Association of MBAs), as well as AACSB (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business), thus making it one of the few schools worldwide to hold the &quot;triple-crown&quot; accreditation, and along with Aarhus BSS, the only two in Denmark.

The CBS campus is located in Frederiksberg, close to the center of Copenhagen, and centers on the school&#x27;s main campus of Solbjerg Plads, completed in 2000. Since the Danish Universities Act of 2003, CBS has had a board of directors with an external majority. The Board of Directors appoints the President of CBS, who is currently Peter Møllgaard. Most of the programs are taught in English, and more than half of the faculty is recruited from abroad, making CBS an international academic environment.

== History ==
CBS was established in 1917 by the Danish Society for the Advancement of Business Education (now known as FUHU), which is a private educational institution. In 1965 the business school became integrated into the Danish educational system as an institution of higher education. Today, it is regulated by the Danish Universities Act of 2003.

== Presidents ==

== Programme structure ==
CBS offers a comprehensive range of university degrees in economics and business administration. Other programmes combine business studies with social sciences and the humanities, offering education in the fields of IT, philosophy, politics, language, sociology, communication and others.

The selection of full-time programmes complies with the three levels:

* 3-year bachelor&#x27;s degree
* 2-year master&#x27;s degree
* 3-year PhD

CBS also offers part-time and full-time programmes in continuing education:
* Executive Master Programmes
* Full-time MBA
* Diploma programmes and short courses

== Exchange programmes ==
CBS is the Danish member of CEMS - Global Alliance in Management Education and a member of Partnership in International Management (PIM), and focuses on double degree agreements with other top business schools. CBS has exchange and cooperation agreements with 390 universities and business schools around the world, half of which are European. 43% of CBS programmes are taught in English and CBS offers approximately 200 separate courses taught in English.

== Facilities ==

=== CBS Campus ===
CBS is an urban university primarily located in four modern buildings in Frederiksberg, close to the center of Copenhagen. The main complex, Solbjerg Plads, was opened in 2000 and includes 34,000 m2 of student and office space surrounded by gardens and outdoor living space. Designed by Vilhelm Lauritzer Architects, the complex consists of interconnected concrete, glass and tile-sided buildings of varying heights that house student auditoriums, faculty office space, a cafeteria, the main library, a student bar and the campus bookstore.

Dalgas Have, opened in 1989 and designed by Henning Larsen Architects, is the oldest building currently in use. Owned by the Danish Pension Fund for Engineers and leased by CBS, the building includes 20,000 m2 of student classrooms, study space and offices distributed around a three-story 175 m long arcade. At the midpoint of the arcade a two-story semi-circular cafeteria sits below a semi-circular library.

Kilen (&quot;The Wedge&quot;) was opened in 2006 and includes 10,000 m2 of student classrooms, study spaces, and offices for research and administration. Designed by Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Architects, the four-story wedge-shaped building features a large oval-shaped atrium that extends the height of the building. The exterior is covered with full-story screens made of wood, matte glass or copper, which rotate in response to the Sun and weather. Kilen has been the recipient of numerous architecture and design awards such as a RIBA European Award in 2006.

Porcelænshaven, the fourth main building that comprises the CBS campus, is leased by CBS from the Danish Society for the Advancement of Business Education. Formerly the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Factory, the factory has been converted into 20,000 m2 of student classrooms, study spaces, offices, and a student residence. A central feature of the building, a 1,000 m2 main hall used for large events, stands in the old location of the factory kiln hall. As part of the factory conversion, Henning Larsen Architects transformed the old raw material storage building into 3,800 m2 of modern study space.

CBS campus buildings reflect characteristic Scandinavian style and have been recognized by Frederiksberg Municipality earning an Award for Good and Beautiful Building in 2006 and 2009. The four main buildings are within walking distance and located along three consecutive stations on the Copenhagen Metro from Lindevang Station (Dalgas Have) to Frederiksberg Station (Solbjerg Plads).

<text>Something Wicked This Way Comes is the fifth studio album by American heavy metal band Iced Earth. Released on June 22, 1998, it was the band&#x27;s first album to feature bassist James MacDonough and guitarist Larry Tarnowski, and is the only Iced Earth album to be solely produced by Jim Morris, who has worked with the band since 1996&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;.

Recorded in March 1998, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; introduced Jon Schaffer&#x27;s fictional story Something Wicked Saga, which would be later expanded upon by the band. The song &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; was written as a tribute to Schaffer&#x27;s deceased childhood friend Bill Blackmon, who inspired the name &quot;Iced Earth&quot;. The album received mixed reviews; it was noted as significantly &quot;heavier&quot; than its predecessor, &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;. It charted in Germany and Austria. During the album&#x27;s supporting tour, the band recorded their first live album, entitled &quot;Alive in Athens&quot;.

==Background==

As with the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;, Iced Earth were again faced with line-up changes. Long-time guitarist Randall Shawver left the band prior to the recording of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, as did drummer Brent Smedley, who was unable to play on the album for personal reasons. Because of these changes, only guitarist Jon Schaffer, vocalist Matt Barlow and bassist James MacDonough were credited as &quot;Iced Earth&quot;, making &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; the first of only two albums to feature a three-piece line-up of the band; the other one being &quot;The Crucible of Man&quot;.

==Writing and recording==

Musically, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; is significantly heavier than its predecessor &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;. According to Jon Schaffer, because many of Iced Earth&#x27;s fans felt that &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; lacked in speed and heaviness, the band tried to have a more diverse collection of songs on &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. Even though some material had already been written prior to the actual writing process, Schaffer has admitted that he struggled writing the remaining songs, attributing these problems to growing stress. One of the songs written right after &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; was &quot;Watching Over Me&quot;, which is about Schaffer&#x27;s childhood friend Bill Blackmon, who died in a motorcycle accident just before Schaffer moved to Florida in 1984.

The album is the first to feature Jon Schaffer&#x27;s Something Wicked Saga. Originally Schaffer had planned to have the entire record be a concept album on the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; storyline, but because some songs unrelated to the concept had already been written following &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;, the band decided to only have the last three tracks be connected to the storyline. The last three songs (&quot;Prophecy&quot;, Birth of the Wicked&quot; and &quot;The Coming Curse&quot;) make up the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy, which introduces the central figure of the saga, Set Abominae (who also appears on the album&#x27;s front cover).

&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was recorded in March 1998 at Morrisound Studios, in Tampa, Florida. It is the only Iced Earth studio album not to be co-produced by Jon Schaffer. Instead, Jim Morris (who has co-produced all of the band&#x27;s albums from &quot;The Dark Saga&quot; onward) is the sole producer. Because Iced Earth didn&#x27;t have a lead guitarist or a drummer, the band hired a number of guest musicians. Mark Prator, who had previously played on &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;, was recruited to play the drums, while Larry Tarnowski was hired as the lead guitarist (although some additional lead guitar parts were played by Jim Morris). Other guests featured on the album included Howard Helm (keyboards), Roger Hughes (mandolin) and Susan McQuinn (flute), among others.

==Release==

&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was released on July 7, 1998. For the album&#x27;s supporting tour, drummer Brent Smedley rejoined the band, while guitarist Larry Tarnowski was hired as a full-time member as well. While on tour, a music video was shot for the track &quot;Melancholy (Holy Martyr)&quot; at Wacken Open Air, 1998. The band also recorded their first live album, &quot;Alive in Athens&quot;, in Athens, Greece on January 23 and 24, 1999.

==Critical reception==
Since its release, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; has had a polarized reaction from critics. Some have viewed the album as one of Iced Earth&#x27;s strongest, while others have considered it one of their weakest.

Metal Storm gave the album a 9.5 out of 10 and called it &quot;the most important release of Iced Earth&quot;, as well as &quot;a must have&quot;. On the other hand, Chronicles of Chaos called the album &quot;tried, tested and tired&quot;. Allmusic saw somewhat similarly, feeling that the album was &quot;virtually replicating their previous effort, &quot;The Dark Saga&quot;, but with somewhat less inspired results&quot;.

Despite the criticism, several songs such as &quot;Burning Times&quot;, &quot;Stand Alone&quot; and the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy received considerable praise. Metal Storm was impressed by the musicianship of &quot;Stand Alone&quot;, and called the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy &quot;the best piece of music that Iced Earth [have] ever played&quot;. Allmusic also felt that the band seemed most at home during the &quot;Something Wicked&quot; trilogy. &quot;Burning Times&quot; and &quot;Stand Alone&quot; were also some of Allmusic&#x27;s track picks.

In 2019, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; ranked &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; as the 11th best power metal album of all time.

<text>William B. Arveson (22 November 1934 – 15 November 2011) was a mathematician specializing in operator algebras who worked as a professor of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Biography==
Arveson obtained his Ph.D. from UCLA in 1964 with thesis advisor Henry Dye and thesis &quot;Prediction theory and group representations&quot;.

Of particular note is Arveson&#x27;s work on completely positive maps. One of his earlier results in this area is an extension theorem for completely positive maps with values in the algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space. This theorem led naturally to the question of injectivity of von-Neumann algebras in general, which culminated in work by Alain Connes relating injectivity to hyperfiniteness.

One of the major features of Arveson&#x27;s work was the use of algebras of operators to elucidate single operator theory. In a series of papers in the 1960s and 1970s, Arveson introduced noncommutative analogues of several concepts from classical harmonic analysis including the Shilov and Choquet boundaries and used them very successfully in single operator theory.

In a highly cited paper, Arveson made a systematic study of commutative subspace lattices, which yield a large class of nonselfadjoint operator algebras and proved among other results, the theorem that a transitive algebra containing a maximal abelian von Neumann subalgebra in B(H) must be trivial.

In the late 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, Arveson played a leading role in developing the theory of one-parameter semigroups of *-endomorphisms on von Neumann algebras - also known as E-semigroups. Among his achievements, he introduced product systems and proved that they are complete invariants of E-semigroups up to cocycle conjugacy.

<text>Waihi is a town in Hauraki District in the North Island of New Zealand, especially notable for its history as a gold mine town.

The town is at the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula, close to the western end of the Bay of Plenty.

==History and culture==

===Mining township===
Waihi is located in the Coromandel district, which was one of the great gold mining districts of the world. The township grew around the mining operations since the discovery of gold in 1878 by prospectors John McCombie and Robert Lee. The samples of rock they had sent to be assayed were not considered worthwhile, so they left the area.

Their claim was taken over by William Nicholl in 1879. He marked out , calling his claim &#x27;Martha&#x27; after a family member. Several smaller claims were later merged to form the Martha Company. By 1882 the first battery to break gold-bearing rock was in operation. The Martha Mine eventually grew into one of the world&#x27;s most important gold and silver mines, after industrial cyanide processes made recovering gold from the low-grade ores easier. Waihi prospered with the mine, by 1908 being the fastest-growing town in the Auckland Province, three times the size of Hamilton.

Waihi was also a major centre of union unrest in New Zealand during the early years of the 20th century. The 1912 miners&#x27; strike led to violence, including the death of unionist Fred Evans in an incident which still causes some resentment in the town.
By 1952, when the mighty Martha Mine closed, around 5.6 million ounces (174,160 kg) of gold and 38.4 million ounces (1,193,180 kg) of silver had been produced from 11,932,000 tonnes of ore. Mining stopped in 1952 after a total of 160 km of tunnels had been driven into the quartz of Martha Hill, not because the Martha had run out of gold, but rather because of fixed gold prices, lack of manpower, and increasing costs. Mining in the Coromandel Peninsula had otherwise ceased by the 1980s.

However, mining later resumed, with some protests against it during the 1987 consent process. Plans to stop operations in the 2000s were eventually shelved as well, and the mines new owner OceanaGold is investing in extending the further economic life of the mine and the underground operations. As of 2009, the mine constituted 25–30% of the local economy.

The Golden Cross mine was a gold and silver mine in the neighbouring Waitekauri Valley. It first operated as an underground gold mine from 1895 to 1920. Gold and silver was mined by underground and open pit methods from 1991 to 1998.

=== Railways ===

In November 1905, a branch line railway was opened to Waihi from Paeroa; this eventually evolved into the East Coast Main Trunk Railway, which reached Taneatua in 1928. By the 1960s, traffic volumes for the port of Tauranga had outgrown the capacity of the circuitous line through Waihi and a deviation to the south was built, including the Kaimai Tunnel. It opened in 1978, making the line through Waihi redundant, but the Goldfields Railway was established to save the six kilometres of railway between Waihi and Waikino. The railway continues to operate today as Goldfields Railway and is a popular tourist attraction.

===Counterculture era===

In the 1970s Waihi saw a large influx of hippies in search of environmentally friendly alternative lifestyles settle there and around the Waikino area. These young counterculture proponents brought with them numerous cottage industries which helped supplement Waihi&#x27;s economy. The Nambassa rock and alternative festivals were held around Waihi and Waikino between 1975 and 1982, increasing the population by around 10,000–75,000 for a few days each year and bringing revenue to the town. Temporary tent cities were established on the Northern end of Waihi on farms up Landlyst Rd at Golden Valley, to accommodate festival goers.

=== Recent history ===
In the late 1980s a new open pit started operations over the top of the old underground mine. This operation is nearing its completion, however recent plans to cutback the pit wall and recent underground mining have postponed the promised lake and recreational area. A new underground mine called Favona is in operation near the processing plant to the east of Waihi. The mining company have stated that it is impossible to create the lake while underground operations are occurring near the site because the low-level water table connects with the underground mine which has to be de-watered.

In the late 1990s several properties had to be condemned and roads such as Brickfield Road, Pipe Lane, Junction Road and parts of Bulltown Road, Hobson Street, Grey Street, Slevin Street, Newman Street, Barry Road, and main road Seddon Avenue permanently closed after the land under them subsided as a result of the collapse of old underground mine workings, with visible holes and cracks on the surface. In December 2001, a home adjacent to Martha Pit collapsed into historical workings, 14 neighbouring homes were affected, some never able to return to get personal belongings. Another 31 homes were also bought once more areas were identified to be at high, medium or low risk of collapse into historical workings adjacent to the pit. Today the mine&#x27;s smoko room sits near this site. Noise, dust, blasting vibrations continue to cause stress for some residents as operations in the pit continue. The iconic Pumphouse has been moved to ensure its safety which also allows for the mine pit to be widened and more gold retrieved from the site the pumphouse was originally housed.

Mine management has received positive responses for its rigorous environmental effects control procedures and its commitment to the local community in terms of consultation and financial assistance. This has, amongst other things, led to the mine management company, Newmont Waihi Gold, receiving the &#x27;Advanced Sustainable Business Award&#x27; from Environment Waikato, the Regional Council of the area. Despite all these attempts some of the mine&#x27;s neighbours do not qualify for compensation for the mine&#x27;s impact.

Mining remains the major employer in the area thanks to the company postponing the long promised mine closure and lake formation in 2007. OceanaGold will stay until 2017 when consents expire, unless they find more resources when they will apply to stay. 
Until the electrical appliance industry was deregulated in New Zealand in the 1980s, Waihi had a television assembly plant operated first by Akrad then by Philips which employed 400 locally and 1500 nationwide.

===Marae===

Waihi has one marae, Waihi Community Marae.

*Waihi Marae, with Tapeka meeting house, is near Tokaanu, and not affiliated nor even close, being down by Turangi, near Taupo..and is Tuwharetoa.

Waihi Town is part of Pare Hauraki area.

== Current mining ==

OceanaGold currently operates the Favona, Trio and Correnso underground gold and silver mines under the eastern end of the Waihi township. The Correnso underground mine is the current active operation and is producing approximately 100,000 ounces of gold each year.

The Martha open pit is not currently active due to a slip on the north wall in April 2016, but continues to draw large tourist numbers visiting the pit and nearby Pumphouse at the top of Waihi&#x27;s main street.

== Education ==

Waihi College is a Year 7–13 secondary school with a roll of . The college was established as a District High School in 1932 and became a Forms 3–7 College in 1954. It moved to its current site in 1959. In 1976 it extended its roll to cover forms 1 and 2. Forms 1–7 are now known as years 7–13.

Waihi Central School is a contributing Year 1–6 primary school, school with a roll of .

Waihi East Primary School is a contributing Year 1–6 primary school, established in 1907, with a roll of .

St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic School is a full Year 1–8 primary state integrated school with a roll of .

All these schools are coeducational. The roll numbers are as of 

== Renumbering project ==
In March 2016 a renumbering project was put into place by Hauraki District Council halving Waihi streets such as Union Street, Rosemont Road, Seddon Avenue and Toomey Street in order to meet demands by the NZ Post office making it easier to find addresses. New street names include Amaranth Street, Montrose Road and Park Lane. Parry Palm Avenue which begins at the entrance from Paeroa now expands to the Martin Road and Baber Street intersection while Kenny Street becomes Waihi&#x27;s longest road beginning at the infamous &#x27;Rocket Park&#x27; (Victoria Park) expanding to the Waihi/Whangamata road. The renumbering project affected 143 Waihi properties and 650 Waihi residents. Montrose Road was originally going to be named Nicholl Street in honour of William Nicholl who developed the Martha Mine, but was at fault due to a last minute change.
== Cornish Pumphouse ==
The &quot;Cornish Pumphouse&quot; was originally built in a different location next to the Martha Mine in 1904 to accommodate a large Cornish steam engine designed to pump water out of the mine. The building&#x27;s design originated from one used in tin mines in Cornwall, England.

The horizontal Cornish pump was used up to 1913 to raise water from a depth of around 400 metres (1,300 ft) via the adjacent No 5 shaft at a rate of over 400,000 litres per hour. After 1913, electric pumps were used to dewater the mine, but the pumphose was kept in working order until 1929 as a backup.

From the 1930s onwards, the building had been stripped of all machinery and left in an increasingly derelict state. In 1983, the building was registered as a Historic Place Category 1 with Heritage New Zealand due to its historical importance as one of the country&#x27;s principal industrial monuments.

In 2001, the area surrounding the pumphouse was fenced off, following subsidence in nearby Barry Road. Investigations reached the conclusion that the only way to protect the building was to relocate it to a safer site. The operation to move the Cornish Pumphouse to a site 300 metres (980 ft) away was started in 2006 with the installation of internal steel bracing and the building of a relocation causeway.

Later in the year, the building, weighing 1,840 tonnes, was moved over the course of three months along teflon-coated concrete beams to its present location, which is easily accessible via a footpath from Seddon Street.

Some internal steel bracing remains installed in the building and it is able to be viewed by the public during daylight hours.

<text>, also known as Aizuwakamatsu Castle (会津若松城 &quot;Aizu-Wakamatsu-jō&quot;) is a Japanese castle in northern Japan, at the center of the city of Aizuwakamatsu, in Fukushima Prefecture.

==Background==
Tsuruga Castle is located in the center of the Aizu basin and at crossroads to Kōriyama to the north and Yonezawa to the east and Murakami on the Sea of Japan coast. During the Nanboku-cho period, the area was ruled by the Ashina clan. Ashina Naomori built within the Aizu basin in 1384. This castle was the predecessor of what later became Tsuruga Castle. It was ruled by Ashina Moriuji until 1561, when he turned his domain over to his son. 

The Ashina clan also built Mukaihaguroyama Castle, a huge mountain castle 10 kilometers south of Aizuwakamatsu. However, by the Sengoku period, the power of the Ashina clan had weakened. Date Masamune, the greatest warlord of the Tōhoku area, who had struggled against the Ashina clan for years, and finally captured the castle in 1589 at the Siege of Kurokawa Castle. However, Masamune was in turn forced to pledge fealty to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, and were obliged to relocate north to Sendai. Aizu then came to be ruled by one of Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals, Gamō Ujisato. Ujisato was expected to keep a close watch on Date Masamune, and thus rebuilt Kurokawa Castle into a modern castle in 1592, renaming it &quot;Tsuruga Castle&quot;, although the populace also referred to it as &quot;Aizu Castle&quot; or &quot;Wakamatsu Castle&quot;. He also built an unprecedentedly huge seven-story &quot;tenshu&quot; in 1593.

==History==
Ujisato died of illness at the age of 39, and Toyotomi Hideyoshi reassigned his vast domain to Uesugi Kagekatsu, whom he relocated from Echigo Province. Although Tsuruga Castle was already large, Uesugi Kagekatsu started to build another castle on the outskirts of Aizuwakamatsu town, but it was never completed. After having sided with the Toyotomi clan during the Sekigahara campaign, the Uesugi Clan was demoted in status and relocated to a much reduced Yonezawa Domain. The domain was then assigned to Katō Yoshiaki, who was noted for his bravery at the Battle of Shizugatake. Under the Katō, the castle was reformed and a new layout was imposed on the surrounding &quot;jōkamachi&quot;. However, during a great earthquake in 1611, the castle was severely damaged, and the &quot;tenshu&quot; was rebuilt into the current configuration. The Katō were dispossessed in 1643 and were replaced by Hoshina Masayuki, the illegitimate son of Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada and thus half-brother of Tokugawa Iemitsu. He later served a regent to the underage Shōgun Tokugawa Ietsuna. Within Aizu, he developed commerce and agriculture, and established han school, the &quot;Nisshinkan&quot;. His successors were permitted to take the &quot;Matsudaira&quot; surname. Throughout the Edo period, Aizu Domain was an important Tokugawa stronghold in the Tōhoku region and was one of the strongest domains in terms of its military power.

During the Bakumatsu period, Matsudaira Katamori was one of the Shōgunate&#x27;s most able and loyalist supporters. After the defeat of the Shōgunate at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and the abdication of power by Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, Matsudaira become one of the leaders in the pro-Tokugawa alliance against the new Meiji government. During the Battle of Aizu in the Boshin War, Tsuruga Castle was besieged by the forces of the Satchō Alliance in October 1868. Although the castle was very strong by traditional standards, the new government army was equipped with western artillery, which was able to shell the castle from surrounding hills for over a month. Faced with the inevitable eventual defeat, Matsudaira surrendered the castle and his remaining forces in November. The surviving castle buildings, pockmarked by artillery during the siege and structurally unstable, were demolished by the new government in 1874. One &quot;yagura&quot; survived the destruction by being relocated to a Buddhist temple, Amida-ji, five-kilometers from the castle.

The castle site was mostly sold off to private landowners, with only the central portion (23 hectares) kept by the government for use by an Imperial Japanese Army garrison until 1908. This area forms the core of the modern National Historic Site. With the popularity of the Byakkotai story in pre-war Japan, a movement arose to preserve the site of the castle, and it was made into a public park. The National Historic Site status was granted in 1934, although the area still suffered from indignities, such as a velodrome operating in the inner bailey until 1957. In 1965, a reconstruction of the &quot;tenshu&quot; in concrete was completed as a symbol of the city. Currently there is a museum inside, and an observation gallery on top with panoramic views of the city. A gate was completed at the same time. In 1991, a &quot;yagura&quot; and a connecting corridor were also reconstructed.

The tea room, named Rinkaku, has been restored and is designated as an Fukushima Prefecture Important Cultural Property. It is open to the public, and at times tea ceremonies are held there.

==Layout==
The primary layout of the castle consists of an inner bailey and three secondary enclosures to the west, north and east. The southern face of the castle was protected by a river. The inner bailey is pentagonal, with length of approximately 200 meters, surrounded by deep moats and tall stone walls. The area is divided internally by walls and corridors, and the &quot;tenshu&quot; is in the northwest corner. The original &quot;tenshu&quot; under the Gamō clan was a massive seven-story structure with black walls and gold roof tiles, similar to Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s Osaka Castle. The &quot;tenshu&quot; rebuilt by the by Katō clan was smaller and was painted white. The secondary enclosures of the castle had clay ramparts, with stonework used in the gate areas. In the north and west of the central area were large bastions.

The total size of the castle area was 600 by 400 meters, but the castle town itself was also guarded by an outer barrier and the river, enclosing a square kilometer.

<doc id="659742" wikidata="Q447850" url="?curid=659742" title="B. H. Roberts">
<text>Brigham Henry Roberts (March 13, 1857 – September 27, 1933) was a historian, politician, and leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He edited the seven-volume &quot;History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot; and independently wrote the six-volume &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;. Roberts also wrote &quot;Studies of the Book of Mormon&quot;—published posthumously—which discussed the validity of the Book of Mormon as an ancient record. Roberts was denied a seat as a member of United States Congress because of his practice of polygamy.

==Early life==

Roberts was born in Warrington, Lancashire, England, the son of Benjamin Roberts, an alcoholic blacksmith and ship plater, and Ann Everington, a seamstress. In the year of his birth, both parents converted to the LDS Church. Benjamin Roberts then abandoned his family. Roberts later wrote, &quot;My childhood was a nightmare; my boyhood a tragedy.&quot;

Assisted by the Perpetual Emigrating Fund, B. H. Roberts and a sister left England in April 1866. In Nebraska, they joined a wagon train and proceeded to walk—for much of the way barefoot—to Salt Lake City, where they were met by their mother, who had preceded them. In 1867, Roberts was baptized into the LDS Church by Seth Dustin, who two years later became his stepfather. Dustin eventually deserted his family, and &quot;after several reappearances, he finally disappeared completely.&quot; Ann Dustin was granted a divorce in 1884. Upon coming to Utah Territory, Roberts settled in Bountiful, which he always from then on considered his home.

Roberts became a miner and participated in the gambling and drinking typical of that time and place. He was once disciplined by a Salt Lake bishop, who warned him that alcohol &quot;would not only beat him to his knees but to his elbows and chin.&quot; But Roberts eventually learned to read, and, after a series of menial jobs, was apprenticed to a blacksmith while attending school. He then became a &quot;voracious reader, devouring books of history, science, philosophy,&quot; especially the Book of Mormon and other Mormon religious texts. In 1878, Roberts married Sarah Louisa Smith, and, in the same year, he graduated first in his class from University of Deseret, the normal school precursor of the University of Utah. He and Sarah eventually had seven children.

After graduation (and the birth of his first child) Roberts was ordained a seventy in his local church branch and taught school to support his family. The LDS Church sent him on a mission to Iowa and Nebraska, &quot;but because the cold weather was hard on his health, he was transferred to Tennessee in December of 1880.&quot; There he rose to prominence as the president of the Tennessee Conference of the Southern States Mission. 

On August 10, 1884, a mob in the small community of Cane Creek murdered two Mormon missionaries and two members of the Mormon congregation. (One of the latter had killed a member of the mob before he was in turn slain.) At some personal risk, Roberts disguised himself as a tramp and recovered the bodies of the two missionaries for their families in Utah Territory.

During a brief return to Utah, Roberts took a second wife, Celia Dibble, by whom he had eight children. From 1889 to 1894, Celia was exiled in Manassa, Colorado, to protect her husband from prosecution for unlawful cohabitation.

In December 1886, while serving as associate editor of the &quot;Salt Lake Herald&quot;, Roberts was arrested on the charge of unlawful cohabitation. He posted bond to appear in court the next day and that night left on a mission to England.

In England, Roberts served as assistant editor of the LDS Church publication the &quot;Millennial Star&quot; and completed his first book, the much reprinted &quot;The Gospel: An Exposition of Its First Principles&quot; (1888).

Returning to Salt Lake City in 1888, as full-time editor of &quot;The Contributor&quot;, he was chosen as one of the seven presidents of the First Council of the Seventy, the third-highest governing body in the LDS Church. &quot;Tiring of evading federal authorities,&quot; Roberts surrendered in April 1889 and pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawful cohabitation. He was imprisoned in the Utah Territorial Prison for five months. Following his release, he moved his families to Colorado and married a third wife, Dr. Margaret Curtis Shipp, after church president Wilford Woodruff issued the 1890 Manifesto that prohibited solemnization of new plural marriages. (Roberts&#x27;s third wife was seven years his senior and had obtained a degree in obstetrics. Roberts seemed to prefer Margaret&#x27;s company, &quot;and this created some trouble&quot; with his other families—although Roberts continued to have children by his other wives. Roberts and Margaret had no children.) Roberts was pardoned in 1894 by U.S. President Grover Cleveland. He resigned as an editor of the &quot;Salt Lake Herald&quot; in 1896, giving his reason that the position that the paper had taken on the recent &quot;Manifesto&quot; was apt to place him in a false light.

==Political and military career==

During the transitional period following 1890, the LDS Church disbanded its People&#x27;s Party and encouraged its membership to align with nationally organized Democrat and Republican parties instead. Roberts became a fervent Democrat and was elected Davis County Delegate to the Utah State Constitutional Convention in 1894. Roberts proved a vocal member of the Convention, particularly in his opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage.

In 1895, Roberts was the losing Democratic candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives, and Roberts believed LDS Church leaders, who were predominantly Republicans, &quot;had unfairly influenced the election by publicly reprimanding him and fellow Democrat Moses Thatcher for running for office without express permission of the Church.&quot; 

The LDS Church then issued the &quot;Political Manifesto of 1895,&quot; which forbade church officers from running for public office without the approval of the Church. Both Roberts and Thatcher refused to agree to the Political Manifesto and were suspended from their ecclesiastical offices. Roberts, believing such a requirement was a basic infringement of his civil rights, capitulated just hours before the deadline of March 24, 1896. He signed the manifesto, wrote a letter of apology to the First Presidency, and was reinstated. Thatcher was more stubborn: he refused to sign, was expelled from the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and barely evaded excommunication. 

In 1898, Roberts was elected as a Democrat to the 56th Congress, but the House of Representatives refused to seat him because of his practice of polygamy. The prolonged battle that ensued to keep his seat, which was not successful, left Roberts bitter.

The governor of Utah had appointed Roberts a chaplain in the Utah National Guard; in 1917, when the United States declared war on Germany, Roberts volunteered to serve as a U.S. Army chaplain. The age limit of forty was waived—Roberts was then sixty—and Roberts became chaplain to the 145th Field Artillery, which arrived in France in September 1918 but did not see action before the Armistice was signed in November.

==Career as a writer==
Roberts wrote two biographies, a novel, eight historical narratives and compilations, and another dozen books about Mormon theology. In the late 1890s, he also helped establish the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; and became the &quot;de facto&quot; editor of this official periodical of the LDS Church. Roberts&#x27;s six-volume &quot;History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Period I, History of Joseph Smith, the Prophet by Himself&quot; featured &quot;critical notes, new documents, sidebar headings for most paragraphs, and extensive interpretive essays that introduced each volume. Unfortunately, Roberts continued the confusing structure of the original, where various documents were spliced together and inaccurately attributed to Joseph Smith.&quot; Roberts served as Assistant Church Historian from 1902 until his death in 1933.

Roberts wrote a novel &quot;Corianton&quot; (1889), published serially in &quot;The Contributor&quot;, and based on the story of Corianton, the son of Alma as told in the Book of Mormon. Though melodramatic and overly didactic, the novel has also been regarded as providing deep and useful portrayals of some of the characters. It was later adapted, along with &quot;A Ship of Hagoth&quot; by Julia MacDonald, into a play by Orestes Utah Bean, and was the inspiration for the 1931 film &quot;&quot;.

Roberts&#x27;s most important work was a comprehensive treatment of Mormon history, which he began in 1909 as a series of monthly articles for a non-Mormon magazine. Roberts repeatedly (and for many years, unsuccessfully) asked church leaders to republish the articles as a multi-volume set. Finally, in 1930 the church agreed to publish it during its centennial celebration. The six-volume &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: Century I&quot; (3,459 pages) covered for the first time many late-19th- and early-20th-century developments. Further, although its viewpoint was &quot;unabashedly Mormon&quot;, Roberts &quot;disdained ... faith promoting myths&quot; and &quot;was a partisan, not an unquestioning apologist.&quot;

Roberts &quot;frequently took a broader view&quot; of the place of the LDS Church &quot;in the heavenly scheme of things than did some of his colleagues. In 1902 he told the Saints that &#x27;while the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is given a prominent part in this great drama of the last days, it is not the only force nor the only means that the Lord has employed to bring to pass those things of which His prophets in ancient times have testified.&#x27;&quot; Roberts&#x27; theology included belief in &quot;the modern liberal doctrine of man and the optimism of the nineteenth century, and it required a bold, rebellious and spacious mind to grasp its full implication.&quot;

Roberts hoped that the church would publish his most elaborate theological treatise, &quot;The Truth, The Way, The Life&quot;, but his attempt to use contemporary scientific theory to bolster Mormon doctrine led, in 1930, to a conflict with Mormon apostle Joseph Fielding Smith, who had been influenced by the writings of young earth creationist George McCready Price. Smith publicly opposed Roberts&#x27;s quasi-evolutionary views in deference to a literal reading of both the Bible and the Latter-day Saint scriptures. The controversy was debated before the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and it &quot;declared a draw: Neither the existence nor the nonexistence of pre-Adamites would constitute church doctrine.&quot; &quot;The Truth, The Way, The Life&quot; was not published until 1994.

==Studies of the Book of Mormon==

Although Roberts continued to testify to the truth of the Book of Mormon, a foundational religious text in Mormonism, he also wrote three studies, unpublished until 1985, that wrestled with Book of Mormon problems. The first, &quot;Book of Mormon Difficulties: A Study,&quot; was a 141-page manuscript written in response to a series of questions by an inquirer, referred to Roberts by church president Heber J. Grant. When Roberts confessed that he had no answer for some of the difficulties, and the General Authorities chose to ignore them, Roberts produced &quot;A Book of Mormon Study,&quot; a treatise of more than 400 pages. In this work he compared the Book of Mormon to the &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; (1823), written by Ethan Smith, which argued Native Americans were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. Roberts found significant similarities between the two books. Finally, Roberts wrote &quot;A Parallel,&quot; a condensed version of his larger study, which demonstrated eighteen points of similarity between the two books, and in which he reflected that the imaginative Joseph Smith might have written the Book of Mormon without divine assistance.

Mormon historians have debated whether the manuscript reflects Roberts&#x27;s doubts or was a case of his playing the devil&#x27;s advocate. When he presented &quot;A Book of Mormon Study&quot; to church leaders, he emphasized that he was &quot;taking the position that our faith is not only unshaken but unshakable in the Book of Mormon, and therefore we can look without fear upon all that can be said against it.&quot; However, Roberts withheld some of his materials from the general authorities.

Roberts asserted that the authenticity of the Restoration must &quot;stand or fall&quot; on the truth of Joseph Smith&#x27;s claim that the Book of Mormon was the history of an ancient people inscribed on a cache of gold plates; Roberts predicted that if church leaders did not address the historical problems of church origins and possible anachronisms in the Book of Mormon, these problems would eventually undermine &quot;the faith of the Youth of the Church.&quot;

Roberts continued to affirm his faith in the divine origins of the Book of Mormon until his death in 1933; but as Terryl Givens has written, &quot;a lively debate has emerged over whether his personal conviction really remained intact in the aftermath of his academic investigations.&quot; According to Richard and Joan Ostling, when Roberts&#x27;s study became better known, especially after its publication by the University of Illinois Press in 1985, Mormon apologists &quot;went into high gear&quot; and &quot;churned out responses&quot; because &quot;Roberts could not be dismissed as an outsider or an anti-Mormon.&quot;

==Later years==

From 1922 to 1927, Roberts was appointed president of the Eastern States Mission, and there he created an innovative &quot;mission school&quot; to teach Mormon missionaries the most effective ways to proselytize. Roberts also served for many years as a leader of the church&#x27;s Young Men&#x27;s Mutual Improvement Association. In 1923, Roberts, suffering from diabetes, collapsed at a conference &quot;commemorating the Centennial anniversary of the revealed existence of the Book of Mormon.&quot; He was treated with the relatively new drug insulin. A year after the death of his third wife, his companion in New York, Roberts returned to Utah; he was senior president of the First Council of Seventy from 1924 to his death. Roberts died on September 27, 1933, from complications of diabetes. He was survived by thirteen children and by his second wife.

Regardless of his ultimate religious beliefs, most scholars would accept the judgment of Brigham Madsen that Roberts possessed a &quot;deeply embedded integrity, and above all ... fearless willingness to follow wherever his reason led him. He could be abrasive in his defense of stubbornly held beliefs, but he had the capacity to change his views when confronted with new and persuasive evidence.&quot; To Leonard J. Arrington, Roberts was &quot;the intellectual leader of the Mormon people in the era of Mormonism&#x27;s finest intellectual attainment.&quot;

<text>James Bradford &quot;Brad&quot; DeLong (born June 24, 1960) is an American economic historian who has been a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, since 1993.

== Early life and education ==
DeLong was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 24, 1960. He received a BA in social studies from Harvard University in 1982, and a PhD in economics from Harvard in 1987. From 1986 to 1987, he was an instructor at MIT, and he taught economics at Harvard and Boston University from 1987 to 1993. In 1991–1992, he was a John M. Olin Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, where he has also been a research associate since 1995.

== Career ==
DeLong joined Berkeley as an associate professor in 1993. From April 1993 to May 1995, he served as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C. As an official in the Treasury Department in the Clinton administration, he worked on the 1993 federal budget, the unsuccessful health care reform effort, and other policies, and on several trade issues, including the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement. He became a full professor at Berkeley in 1997 and has been there ever since.

DeLong has been a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow. Along with Joseph Stiglitz and Aaron Edlin, DeLong is co-editor of &quot;The Economists&#x27; Voice&quot;, and has been co-editor of the &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot;. He is the author of a textbook, &quot;Macroeconomics&quot;, the second edition of which he coauthored with Martha Olney. With Heather Boushey and Marshall Steinbaum, he co-edited the book &quot;After Piketty: The Agenda for Economics and Inequality&quot; (2017), a volume of 22 essays about how to integrate inequality into economic thinking. He also contributes to Project Syndicate.

In 1990 and 1991, DeLong and Lawrence Summers co-wrote two theoretical papers that became critical theoretical underpinnings for the financial deregulation put in place when Summers was Secretary of the Treasury under Bill Clinton. In 2019, DeLong said that he and other neoliberals had been &quot;certainly wrong, 100 percent, on the politics&quot; of economic policies. While he continued to believe that &quot;good incremental policies&quot; might be superior, he concluded that they were politically unattainable because of the lack of Republicans willing to work toward such goals. Instead, DeLong said that he favored &quot;Medicare for all, funded by a carbon tax, with a whole bunch of Universal Basic Income rebates for the poor and public investment in green technologies.&quot; He concluded, &quot;The world appears to be more like what lefties thought it was than what I thought it was for the last 10 or 15 years.&quot;

DeLong is an active blogger on political and economic issues and media criticism. In 2022, he published &quot;Slouching Towards Utopia,&quot; an economic history of the 20th century from a Keynesian perspective.

<doc id="659757" wikidata="Q2167061" url="?curid=659757" title="Systems science">
<text>Systems science, also referred to as systems research or simply systems, is a transdisciplinary field that is concerned with understanding simple and complex systems in nature and society, which leads to the advancements of formal, natural, social, and applied attributions throughout engineering, technology and science, itself.

To systems scientists, the world can be understood as a system of systems. The field aims to develop transdisciplinary foundations that are applicable in a variety of areas, such as psychology, biology, medicine, communication, business, technology, computer science, engineering, and social sciences.

Themes commonly stressed in system science are (a) holistic view, (b) interaction between a system and its embedding environment, and (c) complex (often subtle) trajectories of dynamic behavior that sometimes are stable (and thus reinforcing), while at various &#x27;boundary conditions&#x27; can become wildly unstable (and thus destructive). Concerns about Earth-scale biosphere/geosphere dynamics is an example of the nature of problems to which systems science seeks to contribute meaningful insights.

== Associated fields ==
The systems sciences are a broad array of fields. One way of conceiving of these is in three groups: fields that have developed systems ideas primarily through theory; those that have done so primarily through practical engagements with problem situations; and those that have applied ideas for other disciplines.
===Theoretical fields===
====Chaos and dynamical systems====
====Complexity====
====Control theory====

* Affect control theory
* Control engineering
* Control systems

====Cybernetics====

* Autopoiesis
* Conversation Theory
* Engineering Cybernetics
* Perceptual Control Theory
* Management Cybernetics
* Second-Order Cybernetics
* Cyber-Physical Systems
* Artificial Intelligence
* Synthetic Intelligence

====Information theory====
====General systems theory====
* Systems theory in anthropology
* Biochemical systems theory
* Ecological systems theory
* Developmental systems theory
* General systems theory
* Living systems theory
* LTI system theory
* Social systems
* Sociotechnical systems theory
* Mathematical system theory
* World-systems theory

====Hierarchy Theory====
===Practical fields===

====Critical systems thinking====
====Operations research and management science====
====Soft systems methodology ====

The soft systems methodology was developed in England by academics at the University of Lancaster Systems Department through a ten-year action research programme. The main contributor is Peter Checkland (born 18 December 1930, in Birmingham, UK), a British management scientist and emeritus professor of systems at Lancaster University.

====Systems analysis====

Systems analysis branch of systems science that analyzes systems, the interactions within those systems, or interaction with its environment, often prior to their automation as computer models. Systems analysis is closely associated with the RAND corporation.

====Systemic design====

Systemic design integrates methodologies from systems thinking with advanced design practices to address complex, multi-stakeholder situations.

====Systems dynamics====

:System dynamics is an approach to understanding the behavior of complex systems over time. It offers &quot;simulation technique for modeling business and social systems&quot;, which deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behavior of the entire system. What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying complex systems is the use of feedback loops and stocks and flows.

==== Systems engineering ====

:Systems engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary field of engineering, that focuses on the development and organization of complex systems. It is the &quot;art and science of creating whole solutions to complex problems&quot;, for example: signal processing systems, control systems and communication system, or other forms of high-level modelling and design in specific fields of engineering. Systems Science is foundational to the Embedded Software Development that is founded in the embedded requirements of Systems Engineering.

<text>Stremonius or Saint Austremonius or Saint Stramonius or Austromoine, the &quot;apostle of Auvergne,&quot; was the first Bishop of Clermont. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.

==Legend==
During the consulship (in 250 AD) of the Emperor Decius and Vettius Gratus, according to Gregory of Tours, who calls him Stremonius, Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturninus to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Martial to Limoges, and Austromoine to Clermont. 

At Clermont he is said to have converted the senator Cassius of Clermont and the pagan priest Victorinus, to have sent St. Serenus to Thiers, St. Marius to Salers, and Antoninus into other parts of Auvergne, and to have been beheaded. 

A tradition states that Saint Austremonius ordered Nectarius of Auvergne to Christianize the plain of Limagne in the Massif Central. 
==Veneration==
His veneration was highly localized, but at Clermont he was moved back in time, to the 1st century AD, along with others of the Apostles to Gaul, such as Saint Martial, to become one of the &quot;seventy-two Disciples of Christ&quot;, and was claimed to have been a converted Jew who came with St. Peter from Palestine to Rome and subsequently became the Apostle of Auvergne, as well as of Berry and Nivernais. It is more likely that he was the contemporary of the three Bishops of Aquitaine who attended the Council of Arles in 314.

He was initially buried in a tomb at Issoire on the Couze. The local view found its origin in a life of St. Austremonius written in the 10th century in the Abbey of Mozac, where the body of the saint was transferred in 761. The &quot;Vita&quot; was rewritten and amplified by the monks of Issoire, who retained as a relic the saint&#x27;s head. There is a further elaborated &quot;Vita&quot; of the late 11th century, with new episodes, made at the same time as a forgery of a charter of Pippin (the Short or one of two kings of Aquitaine being intended). The tomb was opened in 1197.

Gregory of Tours, who was born in Auvergne in 544 and was well versed in the history of that country, looks upon Austremonius as one of the seven envoys who, about 250, evangelized Gaul; he relates how the body of the saint was first interred at Issoire, being there the object of great veneration, before the body, though not the head, was translated to Clermont.

The possibility that the major dioceses of Gaul each needed an apostolic figure, and that where the historical details had lapsed (compare Gatien of Tours) one had to be supplied, to serve local pride, should not be entirely dismissed.

<text>Harwoods Hole is a cave system located in the northwest of the South Island of New Zealand, in the Abel Tasman National Park. At , it is New Zealand&#x27;s deepest vertical shaft. It was first explored in 1958, long after it was discovered.

== Formation ==
Evidence suggests that run-off from an area of approximately 20 square km converged into a stream that then flowed down a dry valley to create what is now Harwoods Hole. Since then the river appears to have changed course. Subsequently, Harwoods Hole receives water through sinkholes and surrounding dry valleys; this water then percolates through surrounding rock ensuring it becomes saturated with calcite, before entering the cave where the calcite is deposited. This second phase means that rather than expanding, Harwoods Hole is being filled in.

==History==
It is one of several important cave systems in Tākaka Hill, between Golden Bay and Tasman Bay. Starting at the surface as a diameter entrance and descending , Harwoods Hole is New Zealand&#x27;s deepest vertical shaft. Further in it connects with Starlight Cave. The long rope descent is considered one of the most spectacular parts of the caving experience at Harwoods. Harwoods Hole has an overall depth, defined as height above sea level of entry to height of outlet, of .
Henry Harwood (1844–1927), with John Horton and Thomas Manson, opened up the Canaan Downs area and discovered Harwoods Hole, though it was not immediately entered. It remained untouched until seven cavers explored it over the 1958/59 summer. With a home-built winch weighing , the first person was lowered down on 28 December 1958. Upon completion of the initial exploration, Harwoods Hole became the deepest explored cave in New Zealand, a record that was later broken by Nettlebed Cave in the nearby Mount Arthur region.

The following summer, 21 cavers explored Harwoods Hole further. The team was also interested in finding the outflow of the underground stream. They suspected that The Gorge Creek at East Tākaka was the outlet as the flow rate matched, and green dye released inside Harwoods Hole was soon visible when it emerged at Starlight Cave, so named by the cavers where The Gorge Creek emerged. With the connection confirmed, a squeeze was widened by gelignite and a connection from Harwoods Hole to East Tākaka for cavers was thus established. On 4 January 1960, Harwoods Hole was the site of the first fatality by a member of the New Zealand Speleological Society when the leader of the caving expedition, Peter Lambert, was killed by rock fall. A cairn at the bottom of the shaft with Lambert&#x27;s helmet placed on it acts as a memorial.

==Access==
Near the top of Tākaka Hill on State Highway 60, an unsealed side road leading to Harwoods Hole is sign-posted. After , a car park is reached. From here, a walking track gives access to Harwoods Hole. The hole is not fenced.

<text>El Palo Alto (Spanish: &#x27;the tall stick&#x27;) is a coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;) located on the banks of the San Francisquito Creek in Palo Alto, California, a city in the San Francisco Bay Area. The namesake of the city and a historical landmark, El Palo Alto is years old and stands tall.

Before European arrival, the land around El Palo Alto was home to the Ohlone Native Americans. Local folklore holds that El Palo Alto was a rest stop for the first European expedition that discovered San Francisco Bay, led by Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolá in 1769. The tree became widely known with the early-1850s establishment of a highway between San Francisco and San Jose, and as a landmark along the San Francisco–San Jose railroad, construction of which passed the tree in 1863. In 1876, Leland Stanford, co-founder of Stanford University along with his wife Jane Lathrop Stanford, purchased land near El Palo Alto.

Early images and accounts indicate that El Palo Alto once had two trunks. It lost one trunk before 1883—the exact date is unknown—perhaps due to heavy rainfall and erosion of the riverbank. Fearing the tree&#x27;s total loss, Leland Stanford directed that the riverbank be reinforced with a wooden bulkhead, which was replaced with concrete abutments in 1904 and again in 1911. Coal soot from steam locomotives passing below the tree suffocated the leaves of the tree&#x27;s upper limbs; nearby wells lowered the water table, and by the late 1920s the tree was declared moribund. Although it has decreased in stature by some since the late 1800s, El Palo Alto was ultimately saved by the continuous preservation efforts of the city, local arborists, Stanford University, and Southern Pacific (the owner of the adjacent railroad); a 1997 appraisal concluded that the tree would &quot;persevere and grow for centuries to come&quot;. El Palo Alto is featured prominently on the City of Palo Alto logo and the Stanford University seal, and is recognized by the National Arborist Association and International Society of Arboriculture as a tree of historical importance.

== Name and background ==
El Palo Alto is a coast redwood (&quot;Sequoia sempervirens&quot;), a giant and long-lived tree species only found near the North American Pacific coast. The redwood has been California&#x27;s official state tree since 1937. The world&#x27;s tallest trees are coast redwoods, with the record holder, Hyperion, reaching . El Palo Alto is not so tall, at about , down from in the 19th century. At years, nor is El Palo Alto particularly old; the longest-lived redwoods may approach 2,500 years in age. Although today there are thousands of redwoods in the city of Palo Alto, El Palo Alto is one of only a few not planted by humans. Redwoods generally require wet climates like those found close to the coast, but El Palo Alto is much further inland, close to Palo Alto&#x27;s northern border with Menlo Park. The tree&#x27;s location next to San Francisquito Creek provided it the necessary water to survive.

== History ==
El Palo Alto germinated around AD 940, when the San Francisco Peninsula was populated by the Ohlone people, one of the indigenous peoples of California. The tree is thus contemporaneous with the Viking Age, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in China, or the Fatimid Caliphate in the Islamic world.

Prior to European contact, the Ramaytush speaking subgroup of the Ohlone people lived near to the tree, in the village of Puichon.
=== Portolá&#x27;s expedition ===

Before conquest by Spanish missionaries in the 18th century, the land around El Palo Alto was home to the Ohlone. According to traditional history, El Palo Alto was the campsite of Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolá&#x27;s men between November 6 and 11, 1769. Portolá was traveling north up the California coast from Mexico in search of Monterey Bay, but failed to identify it. Nourished by Ohlone natives, the expedition continued north and on November 1 were greeted with the expanse of the San Francisco Bay. They traveled southwest and arrived at San Francisquito Creek on November 6, 1769, where they camped until November 11.

Visiting the bay in 1774, Father Francisco Palóu came upon a large tree on the creek, considered its location suitable for a new mission, and erected a wooden cross near it. His diary entry indicated the location of Portolá&#x27;s camp as nearby and is the tree&#x27;s first appearance in writing. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and Father Pedro Font visited the tree and concluded the creek&#x27;s flow was too unreliable, instead founding the Mission Santa Clara de Asís—modern day Santa Clara— to the southeast. Font measured the tree with a graphometer: fifty varas (137 feet; 42 m) high and 5.5 varas (15 feet; 3 m) around at the base, noting that soldiers had told him there were larger ones in the mountains. A 1777 map of the bay by Font indicated a large tree on San Francisquito Creek.

Most evidence in the past suggested that El Palo Alto was not the actual tree in Font&#x27;s map or referenced by early Spanish diarists, who recorded their travels in detail but made no mention of a tree with twin trunks. Local historian Steve Staiger said that Portolá&#x27;s camp may have been under a tree further downstream, later felled by a Spanish military engineer to make a bridge. Two candidates for the landmark tree, elsewhere along the creek, fell in 1852 and 1911.

However, in a 2024 presentation by Jeff Watt at the Palo Alto Historical Association, he presented part of a newly discovered field journal from Pedro Font that states on March 30, 1776 that &quot;We arrived at its trunk and saw that it was not a single tree but two trees very close together. From a distance they appear as one...&quot; This discovery was originally published in Alan K. Brown&#x27;s recent book. Jeff concludes his presentation suggesting that evidence is now favoring the idea that El Palo Alto was the tree described in the 1776 expedition. 

=== Early landmark ===

In July 1850, a highway from San Francisco in the north to San Jose to the south was ordered to be built. Previous travelers took narrow trails on horseback or slightly wider tracks on oxcart; it was joked that the road between the two cities was &quot;three miles wide&quot;. The highway passed close to El Palo Alto and likely brought it to prominence. The tree was nearly cut down in 1850, but was saved by a timely shipment of lumber.

El Palo Alto was first known as the Palos Colorados, roughly meaning &#x27;red trees&#x27;. The earliest known reference to the name &quot;Palo Alto&quot; dates to 1853, and an 1856 official land survey labeled it the &quot;Palo Alto Redwoods&quot;; the name &quot;Rancho of Palo Alto&quot; was used as a disambiguation in 1857. Construction of a railroad by the San Francisco &amp; San Jose Railroad Company, connecting San Francisco to San Jose, passed the tree in 1863, making it an obvious landmark for travelers. The section from San Francisco to &quot;Big Tree Station&quot; at the creek was inaugurated on October 7 that year. The Southern Pacific Transportation Company purchased the company in March 1868; the tree was featured in Southern Pacific advertising. Edward Vischer&#x27;s &quot;Pictorial of California&quot; (1870) contains a drawing of the tree with two trunks, noting it to be &quot;one of the very few instances of that mountain monarch [the redwood] being found in the open level country&quot;, and suggests that the tree originally had three trunks, describing it as &quot;[t]wins, once a trio&quot;.

=== Land transfers and the Stanfords ===
The land beneath and nearby the tree passed through various owners before becoming part of the city of Palo Alto, which did not yet exist. Some references state that the tree lay at the northwest corner of a Mexican land grant called Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito, which spanned of oak trees and brush. This corner abutted Rancho San Francisquito to the west and Rancho de las Pulgas to the north. In 1835, the Rinconada grant was first given to Don Rafael Soto, whose father had settled in the de Anza expedition of 1775–76. Soto&#x27;s widow inherited the grant in 1841. She entered a dispute with the US government—which acquired California as a state in 1850, after the Mexican–American War—over whether her claim was valid. Soto&#x27;s heirs were finally declared the rightful owners in 1872, and gave the contractors who had represented them about of land as compensation; the heirs kept the other, northern part.

There is more evidence that El Palo Alto has always been located in a portion of Rancho San Francisquito that extends in a small projection to encompass the area along the creek east of El Camino Real. This is the Rancho that was northwest of Rancho Rinconada del Arroyo de San Francisquito and currently holds the core of Stanford University. This map at Open Historical Map shows this section and the corner that includes El Palo Alto. The most convincing evidence that the tree was part of the Rancho San Francisquito is the land claim case of Maria Concepcion Valencia de Rodriquez of 1866. The attached map that was part of the 1866 claim, shows the tree within the corner of the Rancho where they denote the tree with a plus sign (+) under the words &quot;Twin Redwoods Palo Alto&quot;.

In 1876, parts of Rancho San Francisquito was purchased by Leland Stanford—who later founded Stanford University with his wife Jane Stanford—for his Palo Alto Stock Farm, a place for breeding and training horses. It would eventually grow to about . Following the death of their son in 1884, the Stanfords established a university in his honor on their land. In 1887, Soto&#x27;s heirs sold their land to a good friend of Leland Stanford, Timothy Hopkins, who used it to develop the nearby town of University Park (see 1894 view). In particular, Hopkins acquired land near El Palo Alto, adjacent to Southern Pacific–owned land, that eventually became the city-owned El Palo Alto Park. Stanford University opened on October 1, 1891, with 440 students in attendance, and prompted the rapid growth of University Park. In 1894 it incorporated as the city of Palo Alto, a new name for which Stanford had a &quot;great fondness&quot;. The first university seal, adopted in 1908, featured El Palo Alto prominently (although its artist Arthur Bridgman Clark drew a more &quot;vigorous&quot; tree, how El Palo Alto might have looked centuries earlier), adorned with to its left and to its right as a motto. Yet, even as the tree became so enmeshed with the university&#x27;s branding, its position east of the railroad right of way confirms that there never was a time when El Palo Alto was on land owned by Leland Stanford.

=== One trunk falls ===
El Palo Alto had two trunks until some time between 1875 and 1882, when the north, more-curved trunk fell. The stump&#x27;s rings were counted and gave an age of 967 years.

The exact date and cause of the trunk&#x27;s falling is unknown. A 1900 article in &quot;Palo Alto Live Oak&quot; dates the falling to the winter of 1879, blaming a freshet. A December 1882 article in &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot; states: &quot;Some years ago it had a companion tree, but the latter was undermined by a subterranean stream and fell to the ground.&quot; Local historian Guy Miller studied the matter for over two decades and estimated a date of 1885. Miller suggested that railroad records likely to contain definitive information were destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire. In a Palo Alto Historical Association talk on October 6, 2024 by Jeff Watt, a local Palo Alto electrical engineer, he presented evidence that the twin tree likely fell in 1875. 

The San Francisquito Creek&#x27;s eroding banks further threatened El Palo Alto. Fearing its loss, after the first trunk fell, Leland Stanford directed a wooden bulkhead to be built reinforcing the tree&#x27;s side of the creek. In 1904 Jane Stanford ordered the building of a cement wall, which was further reinforced around 1909 by Southern Pacific.

Early Stanford students had a tradition of climbing the tree and placing a flag as high as possible. The day before admissions day of 1909, a Stanford student (or possibly an employee) was marooned and had to be rescued by other students at night time, marking the last known climb.

=== Declining health ===
Smog and disruption of roots from the railroad placed El Palo Alto under existential threat; the adjacent railroad was doubled to two tracks in 1902 and by the 1920s the tree was passed by some 70 trains per day. Nearby wells and water being taken from San Francisquito Creek lowered the water table, depriving the tree of needed water. Stanford botany professor George James Peirce already found in 1901 that the tree&#x27;s crown was seriously injured, that the railway had caused changes in the nearby soil&#x27;s drainage, and that a &quot;thicket of suckers&quot; was present around the tree, akin to those seen &quot;around the stump of a felled or fallen redwood of advanced age.&quot; In 1915 Peirce planted seven redwoods on university grounds so that one of them could succeed El Palo Alto following its death. Six remain—one was crushed as a sapling by a lawnmower.

The Native Sons of the Golden West, an organization dedicated to the preservation of California landmarks, took stewardship of the tree in 1920. Southern Pacific leased the tree to the Native Sons in 1922 and in 1925 the surrounding land was converted into a park, now El Palo Alto Park. The park spans and has a pedestrian-bike pathway connecting Palo Alto to Menlo Park. University tree surgeons filled decayed cavities with cement and the tree&#x27;s base was irrigated using six-inch pipes, sunk eight feet into the earth at regular intervals. Southern Pacific hooked up guy wires to stabilize the tree.

Fearing the tree&#x27;s death, the Native Sons placed a plaque set in a granite boulder under the tree in 1926, in a ceremony attended by more than a thousand people and featuring speeches from the mayor, a Stanford professor, a Southern Pacific representative, and several Native Sons. Despite continuous preservation efforts, by the late 1920s newspapers declared the tree moribund. The top of the tree continued to die and measurements in 1950 found a height of , compared to in 1930.

=== Recovery ===

A watering system—dubbed the &quot;Fool the Redwood Plan&quot; by a caretaker—was installed in 1955 to simulate the moisture that redwoods get in their typical habitat, and to wash soot off the foliage; dead branches were removed during installation. A Jeep-mounted pump was used twice a month to pump water for two hours up the line, which reached above the tree. It soon became clogged and bent out of shape by high winds, but was fixed in 1958 in a collaboration with the city fire department. In 1961 six local arborists together deemed the tree to be in fair condition, but suffering from smog, insufficient water, termites, and a deteriorating root system. Smaller, &quot;nurse&quot; trees were planted to protect El Palo Alto&#x27;s root system from compacted soil. Dead wood and termite infestations were progressively removed, mulch was added at the tree&#x27;s base, and the tree&#x27;s top was cut off as it died.

El Palo Alto Park was officially named and made a city park in June 1971. With their disbandment in 1974, the Native Sons&#x27; lease of the land immediately around the tree from Southern Pacific expired. The city of Palo Alto, who had long cared for the tree, had incorrectly assumed they were part of the lease. The city sent Southern Pacific a new lease in 1978.

The switching of nearby cities to the Hetch Hetchy water system incidentally let the water table return. Together with watering and fertilization efforts the tree was finally adorned with new growth. A 1999 appraisal concluded that &quot;notwithstanding a catastrophic event ... it is expected that the El Palo Alto redwood will persevere and grow for centuries to come.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Once a lone tall tree visible for miles, the tree&#x27;s decline and the growth of nearby planted trees, such as eucalyptus, have made El Palo Alto much less visible from afar. El Palo Alto stands at about in height, with a diameter and crown spread of , and enjoys much greater health than it did a century ago. Preservation efforts continue, including with ground-penetrating radar, &quot;air-spade excavation&quot;, drone monitoring of the tree&#x27;s crown, and a prism attached to its top to track movement. Caltrain plans to make the railroad electric by 2024, which would eliminate the impact of smoke, and will replace the 1902 trestle.

The tree remains prominent on the City of Palo Alto seal, in the Stanford University seal, and as a mascot in the university&#x27;s marching band. The State of California designated the nearby &quot;Portolá Journey&#x27;s End&quot; as the second California Historical Landmark in 1932; in 1974 the tree itself was registered with the state as a Point of Historical Interest. In 1987 the National Arborist Association and the International Society of Arboriculture recognized the tree for its historical importance. In 2004, seedlings from El Palo Alto were planted in the American Forests Historic Tree Nursery in Jacksonville, Florida.

<text>Redfield Proctor (June 1, 1831March 4, 1908) was a U.S. politician of the Republican Party. He served as the 37th governor of Vermont from 1878 to 1880, as Secretary of War from 1889 to 1891, and as a United States Senator for Vermont from 1891 to 1908.

==Biography==
Redfield Proctor was born on June 1, 1831. a native of Proctorsville, a village named after his family in the town of Cavendish in Windsor County, Vermont. His father, Jabez Proctor, was a farmer, merchant, and prominent local Whig politician. He was raised by his mother, Betsy Parker Proctor (1792–1871), from age 8 after the sudden death of his father. Proctor&#x27;s first cousins on his mother&#x27;s side included Isaac F. Redfield and Timothy P. Redfield, both justices of the Vermont Supreme Court.

After graduating from Dartmouth College in 1851, Proctor returned to Proctorsville, where he became first a businessman, and later a lawyer. He earned his master&#x27;s degree from Dartmouth College and graduated from Albany Law School in 1859. He married Emily Jane Dutton in 1858, and moved to Boston, Massachusetts two years later. They had five children; Arabella G. Proctor Holden (1859–1905), Fletcher Dutton (1860–1911), Fanny Proctor (1863–1883) Redfield Jr. (1879–1957), and Emily Dutton Proctor (1869–1948). He was initiated into Delta Upsilon fraternity as an honorary member by the Middlebury College Chapter.

==Civil War==
Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, Proctor returned to Vermont and enlisted in the 3rd Vermont Infantry, was commissioned as lieutenant and quartermaster, and repaired to the front. In July of the same year he was appointed on the staff of General William F. (&quot;Baldy&quot;) Smith, and in October was promoted and transferred to the 5th Vermont Infantry, of which he was commissioned major. With this regiment he served nearly a year in the neighborhood of Washington and on the Peninsula. In October 1862, Major Proctor was promoted to colonel of the 15th Vermont Infantry, and participated in the Gettysburg Campaign, but was stationed in the rear and did not participate in the battle.

==Career==
After being mustered out of military service in 1863, Proctor initially returned to practicing law, this time in Rutland, Vermont. He entered into law partnership with Wheelock G. Veazey. In 1869, he entered business again, taking a job as a manager in the Sutherland Falls Marble Company. In 1880, this company merged with another to become the Vermont Marble Company, over which Proctor served as president. Six years later, the area containing the company&#x27;s marble quarries was split into a separate town called Proctor.

During these years, Proctor began his political career. In 1866 he became a selectman of the town of Rutland. In 1867 he represented his town in the Vermont House of Representatives, serving as chairman of the committee on elections. Again a member of the House in 1868, he served as a member of the committee on ways and means. Elected to the Vermont Senate in 1874, he was chosen president pro tempore.

In 1876 Proctor was elected lieutenant governor, and in 1878 was nominated by the Republicans and elected Governor of Vermont. He remained active in state politics after stepping down as governor. He was delegate-at-large to the Republican National Convention in 1884, and also in 1888. In the latter year he was chairman of the Vermont delegation, and seconded the presidential nomination of Benjamin Harrison.

In 1888, he was again elected to the Vermont House. Following the 1888 presidential election, the Vermont legislature unanimously recommended him for a cabinet position, and in March 1889, President Benjamin Harrison chose Proctor to be his Secretary of War. At the War Department, Proctor made a mark with his managerial skill and reforming zeal, with which he modernized the Army and improved the living conditions of enlisted soldiers.

From President Harrison State of the Union Address, Dec 1892:

The report of the Secretary of War exhibits the results of an intelligent, progressive, and businesslike administration of a Department which has been too much regarded as one of mere routine. The separation of Secretary Proctor from the Department by reason of his appointment as a Senator from the State of Vermont is a source of great regret to me and to his colleagues in the Cabinet, as I am sure it will be to all those who have had business with the Department while under his charge.

In the administration of army affairs some especially good work has been accomplished. The efforts of the Secretary to reduce the percentage of desertions by removing the causes that promoted it have been so successful as to enable him to report for the last year a lower percentage of desertion than has been before reached in the history of the Army. The resulting money saving is considerable, but the improvement in the morale of the enlisted men is the most valuable incident of the reforms which have brought about this result.

Proctor left the War Department in November 1891 to become a United States Senator, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of George F. Edmunds. As a Senator he served as chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee to Establish a University of the United States from 1891 to 1893, the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry (1895–1909), and the Committee on Military Affairs (1905–1907). He remained a Senator for the rest of his life, and was an effective advocate in the Senate for high tariffs and the gold standard, as well as an influence on the military policies of the McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt administrations.

==Death==
Proctor died in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 1908. He is interred at South Street Cemetery, Proctor, Vermont. Two of Proctor&#x27;s children, Fletcher D. Proctor and Redfield Proctor, Jr., served as Governors of Vermont, as did his grandson Mortimer R. Proctor. His 1867 Rutland residence is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Curb Records (also known as Asylum-Curb and formerly known as MCG Curb) is an American record label started by Mike Curb, originally as Sidewalk Records in 1963. From 1969 to 1973, Curb merged with MGM Records where Curb served as President of MGM and Verve Records.

== History ==
Throughout the years, the Curb Companies have had major successes with such artists as the Stone Poneys (featuring Linda Ronstadt), Eric Burdon and War, Sammy Davis Jr., the Osmond Family (including Donny &amp; Marie), Lou Rawls, Exile, the Righteous Brothers, Solomon Burke, Gloria Gaynor, the Hondells, the Arrows (featuring Davie Allan), Lyle Lovett, Roy Orbison, the Electric Flag (featuring Mike Bloomfield and Buddy Miles), the Sylvers, and the Four Seasons. The Four Seasons&#x27; comeback album, &quot;Who Loves You&quot;, included &quot;December 1963 (Oh, What a Night)&quot;. It was the first single to spend more than one year on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart.

Curb&#x27;s roster past and present includes Chet Atkins, Rodney Atkins, Kaci Battaglia, Bellamy Brothers, KMC Kru(hip-hop) Lee Brice, Sawyer Brown, Solomon Burke, Clark Family Experience, Sammy Davis Jr., Desert Rose Band, Exile, Family Force 5, Four Seasons, Gloria Gaynor, Lee Greenwood, Steve Holy, Wynonna Judd, The Judds, Hal Ketchum, Lyle Lovett, Ronnie McDowell, Tim McGraw, Jo Dee Messina, Roy Orbison, Lou Rawls, Righteous Brothers, LeAnn Rimes, Rio Grand, Neil Sedaka, T.G. Sheppard, Jim Stafford, Ray Stevens, Jonathan Thulin, Mel Tillis, Trick Pony (featuring Heidi Newfield), Hank Williams Jr. and Chris Young.

In late 2002, Curb Records also acquired a stake in Word Records from then-owners Time Warner. Warner Music Group sold its remaining stake in the label to Curb in 2016, making Word a wholly owned subsidiary, while Warner Music continues to distribute its output.

Four-time GMA Music Award Female Vocalist of the Year Natalie Grant is signed to Curb Records, in addition to the five-time GMA music award-winning group Selah. Throughout the years, Curb has had success with other Gospel music artists such as MercyMe, the Second Chapter of Acts, Degarmo and Key, Patti Cabrera, Michael English, Debby Boone, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Barlowgirl, pureNRG, Worship Kids, Francesca Battistelli, Big Daddy Weave, Building 429, Fernando Ortega, Downhere, Nicole C. Mullen, Larry Norman, Jonathan Pierce, Plumb, Point of Grace, Group 1 Crew, Salvador, Jamie Slocum, Steller Kart, Jaci Velasquez and Mark Schultz.

In 2006, Curb launched a sister rock label Bruc Records, the name of which is an backronym for &quot;Blues, Rock, Urban, Country&quot; (the name is also &quot;Curb&quot; spelled backwards). &quot;Straight to Hell&quot; by Hank Williams III was the first album to be released on the new imprint.

In 2011, Curb filed a lawsuit against singer Tim McGraw alleging breach of contract, and McGraw filed a counter lawsuit against Curb. Early court rulings came down in favor of McGraw. In 2012, McGraw stopped recording with Curb, which had released all his albums and singles since 1990s, and switched to Big Machine Records.

In 2015, Jim Ed Norman was named CEO of the Curb Group. However, Mike Curb remains extremely involved as the founder and chairman of the board.

== Curb Foundation ==
Curb Records supports charitable programs through the Mike Curb Family Foundation. Some of the supported programs include: the Mike Curb Family Welcome Center at Second Harvest, Curb Youth Symphony, Curb Young Musicians Competition, Curb Concerto Competition, the Curb Family Humane Center, the Curb Junior Achievement Center in Los Angeles and Nashville, the Curb Family Pediatric Center, the Nashville Boy Scout Conference Center, the Patriots Theatre at Fort Campbell, the Curb Family Education Oasis Center and the Stella Curb Teacher Development Classrooms.

The Curb Foundation is very active in education including the Curb Center at Vanderbilt (which has launched the Curb Creative Campus Program), the Curb College for Music Business at Belmont University, the Curb College of Arts, Media and Communication at Cal State University Northridge, the Curb Beaman Jubilee Singers Chair at Fisk University, the Curb College of Arts, Music and Sciences at Daytona State College, the Business and Law Chair and Facility at Claremont McKenna College, the Curb Learning Lab for Music and Entertainment at Baylor University, the Curb Keller Dormitories at Neve Yerushalayim in Jerusalem University and the Curb History Institute at Rhodes College.

== Projects ==
In conjunction with Curb&#x27;s educational projects, Curb has purchased and restored Elvis Presley&#x27;s first home in Memphis, Tennessee, the Johnny Cash Museum in Nashville, Tennessee, the Historic RCA Studio B, and Columbia&#x27;s Historic Quonset Hut (which was the first recording studio on Nashville&#x27;s famed Music Row). These historic facilities were used by students, at the various Curb-supported colleges and universities, for the purpose of studying music history.

In October 2008, the 6,000 seat Curb Event Center at Belmont University in Nashville hosted the Town Hall Presidential debate between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama.

== Curb Records (Europe) ==
In the United Kingdom, Curb artists (apart from those sub-licensed to majors) are eligible for the UK &#x27;independent&#x27; charts. In January 2006, Curb scored a Top 10 hit with Brian Kennedy and Peter Corry&#x27;s &quot;Tribute to George Best&quot;, an EP featuring recordings of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;. Curb previously had major hits in Europe with the Four Seasons, the Osmonds, LeAnn Rimes and soundtracks, such as &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;.

<text>Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT (&quot;Finnish&quot;: Lappeenrannan-Lahden teknillinen yliopisto LUT), better known by the abbreviation LUT University (&quot;Finnish&quot;: LUT-yliopisto) is a Finnish public research university which was established in 1969. The university&#x27;s Lappeenranta campus is situated on the shore of lake Saimaa – the 4th largest lake in Europe. LUT University&#x27;s second campus is in the Finnish city of Lahti. The university also has research units in the Finnish cities of Mikkeli and Kouvola, as well as a regional office in Brussels, Belgium.

LUT University is split into two schools of engineering and technology, a school of business and a department of social sciences. The schools focus on renewable and sustainable technologies such as clean water and air, renewable energy, circular economy and the impact of technology on society.

There are 1,380 staff members and 7,770 students in the university. Over 5,000 students reside in the Lappeenranta campus area, and the Lahti campus hosts around 1,000 students. The university also has 701 students attending Open University and 621 students in continuing education. Over 15% of the university&#x27;s student population is international and the school has a representation of 98 different nationalities 

LUT University is a public university under the advisory of the Finnish government. LUT University and LAB University of Applied Sciences form the higher education organization LUT Universities. LUT University is a theoretical research university branch that focuses on academics and research, while LAB University of Applied Sciences is a career oriented school with practical innovation.

==History==

In the 1950s, the Finnish government noticed that the country lacked accessible higher education, with most of the universities in Finland at that time being located in Helsinki and a few other cities that were largely out of reach for the average Finn. This caused a reform of the higher education system in Finland that would eventually lead to the creation of several universities in the following decades. The Finnish government made plans to establish the University of Eastern Finland in various cities, eventually landing on Lappeenranta, Kuopio and Joensuu as candidate cities. It was recognized that each city needed a university, but were too small population wise to support a complete university, hence the future university would be split, with each city teaching a specific subject, with the engineering and technical education being placed in Lappeenranta. The three new universities would be called Lappeenrannan teknillinen korkeakoulu (LTKK), Kuopion Korkeakoulu (University of Kuopio), and Joensuun Korkeakoulu (University of Joensuu). LTKK was the third and newest technical university, after TKK and TTKK. 

LTKK would start its operations in the city center of Lappeenranta in 1969 with a class of 39 students. The first buildings of the current Skinnarila district campus were completed in 1974. In 1991, a department of business was also added to the university. In 2003, LTKK would change names to Lappeenrannan teknillinen yliopisto (LTY/LUT). Generally in Finland, universities would be named korkeakoulu if they had only a few study fields and subjects, with universities that had multiple fields of study carrying the yliopisto name. The english name of the university, Lappeenranta University of Technology, would be used more frequently, and the abbreviation LUT would become synonymous with the university in Lappeenranta.

LUT University started permanent operations in Lahti in 1996 in the form of a small research unit. University of Kuopio and University of Joensuu were combined into the University of Eastern Finland in 2010, while LUT stayed independent and kept its Lappeenranta campus as well as its previously added operations in Lahti.

The LUT Universities Group was formed in 2017 when LUT acquired Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK) and Saimaa University of Applied Sciences (SAIMIA). This change came as the Finnish government was looking to reduce the amount of small universities in Finland, and also move the operations of universities of applied sciences under universities. SAIMIA had previously moved from its city center campus to the same campus area as LUT in Lappeenranta, and the fusion of the two universities into one organization was a natural one. LAMK had faced some difficulties in the past, with many critiquing the institution due to its decisions to reduce programs in fields like arts due to budget constraints. Eventually, the decision was made to transfer the organization under LUT. With both LAMK and SAIMIA under LUT&#x27;s organization, both universities were closed permanently and their operations were moved to the new LAB University of Applied Sciences. LAB took the parts that worked with LAMK and SAIMIA, and created a new fused university of applied science with a stricter focus on education and work. LAB also strengthened the arts departments of LAMK and SAIMIA.

After the acquisition of LAMK and the creation of LAB University of Applied Sciences, LUT expanded its reach and opened a second campus. The city of Lahti was a natural choice since the new LUT Universities Group already managed the university of applied science operation in the city, and the city also lacked a full science university despite its large population. In 2019, the new campus was opened and the university requested a change to the Finnish Universities Act to change names from Lappeenranta University of Technology to Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT, not only keeping the LUT abbreviation but officially adding it to the full name of the institution. This request was accepted by the Finnish government, and from then on the name LUT was used less as an abbreviation but rather as a descriptive name for the university, leading to the abbreviation name change to LUT University.

LUT University began their first English bachelor&#x27;s program of Technology and Engineering Science in 2019, allowing students a multidisciplinary opportunity for engineering education in Finland. Later in 2020, the university negotiated a joint contract with Chinese Hebei University of Technology (HEBUT) to offer English based bachelor&#x27;s programs in both the Lappeenranta and Lahti campuses. In 2023, the university started its first bachelor&#x27;s programs in social sciences, with master&#x27;s programs in social sciences and communications sciences starting up in 2024.

== Lappeenranta Campus ==
LUT University&#x27;s Lappeenranta campus is the original and largest campus of LUT University. The campus is located off from the city center of Lappeenranta in the district of Skinnarila. The campus gives students round-the-clock access to campus resources such as the academic library and gym at all times. The campus also has the Jamie Hyneman Center (JHC), named after LUT University&#x27;s professor of practice Jamie Hyneman, who is known for the show Mythbusters. Most of LUT University&#x27;s research and laboratories are located in the Lappeenranta campus.

The Lappeenranta campus is connected to the campus of LAB University of Applied Sciences&#x27; Lappeenranta campus via a skybridge. LAB students have access to LUT&#x27;s academic library and other portions of the LUT building, while LUT students have access to LAB spaces such as the sports hall. Overall, the campus houses over 8,500 students among LUT University and LAB University of Applied Sciences, and combined with other experts and companies on campus the campus population exceeds 10,000. There are about 3,500 LAB University of Applied Sciences students and over 5,000 LUT University students studying on the Lappeenranta campus.

Each program at LUT University has their own unique guild (study/subject organization) and guild room. Incoming students can expect an alive and vibrant student life. The Lappeenranta campus is known for holding the world&#x27;s longest Vappu, normally a one-day celebration in Finland which in Lappeenranta lasts between three and four weeks each year.

Each guild of LUT in Lappeenranta has their own distinctly colored overalls which distinguish them in student events. Overall colors are as follows:

It should also be noted that the students from LAB University of Applied Sciences also have their own overall colors and traditions on campus, and that the student clothing tradition is not limited to just LUT students.

Each year, first year students get &quot;baptized&quot; typically in Lake Saimaa, and become first year students. Students get baptized a second time during Vappu to become a &quot;Teekkari&quot; student, meaning a Technology and Engineering Student, &quot;Kylteri&quot; student, meaning business student. Social science students also take part in the tradition.

The Lappeenranta campus has a large variety of restaurants, cafes, and bars. This includes the student union owned YOLO restaurant, and a restaurant operated by Compass Group at the KIELO campus building for companies. Inside the university there is a campus shop, cafe, buffet, pizza buffet restaurant, and some other restaurants and recreation. There is a restaurant and cafe inside the LAB University of Applied Sciences connected to LUT through a skybridge, and there is also a bar that is near student housing on campus. The student union building also has a grocery store students can use to buy essentials. The Finnish Student Health Service (FSHS/YTHS) also has a health center on campus that students can use which includes but is not limited to dental, physical and mental health support.

== Lahti Campus ==

LUT University&#x27;s second campus is located in the Finnish city of Lahti. The Lahti campus shares a space with LAB University of Applied Sciences&#x27; Lahti campus. The campus is located inside a renovated factory, of which a portion belongs to the universities, but is also shared among various companies and institutes. While operations in Lahti were started in 1996, the campus itself is very new. Because of this, the campus is still forming and a variety of features and offerings of the Lappeenranta campus are not yet present in Lahti.

The Lahti campus shares some of the student traditions of guilds and colored student overalls, and has many of the same features to the Lappeenranta campus. The campus has been steadily growing and new programs and features are added consistently. With LAB University of Applied Sciences, the Lahti campus has about 6,000 students, of which about 1,000 are LUT students. About half of LUT University&#x27;s international bachelor&#x27;s programs in English are located on the Lahti campus. The campus also has a large amount of Finnish master&#x27;s programs relating to commercial science and engineering. Because of this, the student population of the Lahti campus largely consists of master&#x27;s level students.

The Lahti campus hosts several student guilds, which are responsible for the students on the Lahti campus. LAB University of Applied Sciences also has their own student guilds on campus for their respective fields.

While other universities like the University of Helsinki have had higher education opportunities in Lahti, LUT University and LAB University of Applied Sciences are the currently the only schools of higher education in the area with an extensive list of study subjects, making it a choice for those who want to study and live near the city of Lahti.

The Lahti campus has two restaurants and cafes for students. The campus also has a small section of the university academic library. 

== LUT Regional Units and Offices ==
The Mikkeli research unit opened in 2002, and currently has five professors working with groups of research students. The research unit focuses on research and doctoral studies. The current research in Mikkeli centers on climate issues.

The Kouvola research unit has also been operational since 2002, and is focusing on research relating to technology and business, as well as railway logistics. The research unit houses the innovation logistics master&#x27;s program.

The Brussels regional office exists to strengthen the university&#x27;s cooperation with its European partners.

== Degrees, Reputations and Rankings ==
LUT awards the following degrees: Bachelor of Science (Economics), Bachelor of Science (Technology), Bachelor of Social Science, Master of Science (Economics), Master of Science (Technology), Master of Social Sciences, Licentiate of Science (Economics), Licentiate of Science (Technology), Doctor of Science (Technology), Doctor of Science (Economics), and Doctor of Philosophy.

LUT University has been ranked in the top 5 Finnish universities in the 2023 QS Top 500 universities list, and is in the top 3% of universities globally. The university is ranked second in Finland in the fields of Physical Sciences and Business and fifth in Engineering.

LUT has been ranked as one of the world&#x27;s 20 most rapidly developing challenger universities and was also ranked as the 9th best university for climate action. The university has further been ranked in the Times Higher Education&#x27;s Top 20 world&#x27;s best small universities list.

In the year 2024, LUT University received &quot;6,601&quot; domestic applicants, and accepted &quot;591&quot; new students. This puts LUT University&#x27;s overall domestic acceptance rate for the year 2024 at 11%. However, some fields are more popular and difficult to be accepted into than others. The field of business itself accounts for roughly 50% (3,069) of the overall applications to the university despite only having 140 starting spots. At the same time, the fields in engineering tend to have a much less drastic application-to-spot ratio.

<doc id="659822" wikidata="Q1413924" url="?curid=659822" title="Satellite laser ranging">
<text>Satellite laser ranging (SLR) is a method to measure the distance to satellites in a geocentric orbit. It consists of an astronomical observatory equipped with a laser that sends ultrashort pulses of light. The pulses hit the satellite and bounce back to be caught by the station, which measure the round trip time with the speed of light formula. These measurements are instantaneous and with millimeter level precision, which can be accumulated to provide accurate measurement of orbits and a host of important scientific data. Some satellites have retroreflectors, but the method also works on space debris.

Satellite laser ranging is a proven geodetic technique with significant potential for important contributions to scientific studies of the earth/atmosphere/ocean system. It is the most accurate technique currently available to determine the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean topography.

Its ability to measure the variations over time in Earth&#x27;s gravity field and to monitor motion of the station network with respect to the geocenter, together with the capability to monitor vertical motion in an absolute system, makes it unique for modeling and evaluating long-term climate change by:

* providing a reference system for post-glacial rebound, plate tectonics, sea level and ice volume change
* determining the temporal mass redistribution of the solid earth, ocean, and atmosphere system
* determining Earth orientation parameters, such as Earth pole coordinates and length-of-day variations
* determining of precise satellite orbits for artificial satellites with and without active devices onboard
* monitoring the response of the atmosphere to seasonal variations in solar heating.

SLR provides a unique capability for verification of the predictions of the theory of general relativity, such as the frame-dragging effect.

SLR stations form an important part of the international network of space geodetic observatories, which include VLBI, GPS, DORIS and PRARE systems. On several critical missions, SLR has provided failsafe redundancy when other radiometric tracking systems have failed.

== History ==

Laser ranging to a near-Earth satellite was first carried out by NASA in 1964 with the launch of the Beacon-B satellite. Since that time, ranging precision, spurred by scientific requirements, has improved by a factor of a thousand from a few metres to a few millimetres, and more satellites equipped with retroreflectors have been launched.

Several sets of retroreflectors were installed on Earth&#x27;s Moon as part of the American Apollo and Soviet Lunokhod space programs. These retroreflectors are also ranged on a regular basis (lunar laser ranging), providing a highly accurate measurement of the dynamics of the Earth/Moon system.

During the subsequent decades, the global satellite laser ranging network has evolved into a powerful source of data for studies of the solid Earth and its ocean and atmospheric systems. In addition, SLR provides precise orbit determination for spaceborne radar altimeter missions mapping the ocean surface (which are used to model global ocean circulation), for
mapping volumetric changes in continental ice masses, and for land topography. It provides a means for subnanosecond global time transfer, and a basis for special tests of the Theory of General Relativity.

The International Laser Ranging Service was formed in 1998 by the global SLR community to enhance geophysical and geodetic research activities, replacing the previous CSTG Satellite and Laser Ranging Subcommission.

== Applications ==
SLR data has provided the standard, highly accurate, long wavelength gravity field reference model which supports all precision orbit determination and provides the basis for studying temporal gravitational variations due to mass redistribution. The height of the geoid has been determined to less than ten centimeters at long wavelengths less than 1,500 km.

SLR provides mm/year accurate determinations of tectonic drift station motion on a global scale in a geocentric reference frame. Combined with gravity models and decadal changes in Earth rotation, these results contribute to modeling of convection in the Earth&#x27;s mantle by providing constraints on related Earth interior processes. The velocity of the fiducial station in Hawaii is 70 mm/year and closely matches the rate of the background geophysical model.

<text>A frame story (also known as a frame tale, frame narrative, sandwich narrative, or intercalation) is a literary technique that serves as a companion piece to a story within a story, where an introductory or main narrative sets the stage either for a more emphasized second narrative or for a set of shorter stories. The frame story leads readers from a first story into one or more other stories within it. The frame story may also be used to inform readers about aspects of the secondary narrative(s) that may otherwise be hard to understand. This should not be confused with narrative structure. Notable examples are the &quot;1001 Nights&quot; and &quot;The Decameron&quot;.

== Origins ==

Some of the earliest frame stories are from ancient Egypt, including one in the Papyrus Westcar, the &quot;Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor&quot;, and &quot;The Eloquent Peasant&quot;. Other early examples are from Indian literature, including the Sanskrit epics &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Panchatantra&quot;, Syntipas&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Wise Masters&quot;, and the fable collections &quot;Hitopadesha&quot; and &quot;Vikram and The Vampire&quot;. This form gradually spread west through the centuries and became popular, giving rise to such classic frame tale collections as the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;), &quot;The Decameron&quot;, and the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, in which each pilgrim tells his own kind of tale, and whose frame story &quot;was once the most admired part of Chaucer&#x27;s work&quot;. 

The use of a frame story in which a single narrative is set in the context of the telling of a story is also a technique with a long history, dating back at least to the beginning section of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which the narrator Odysseus tells of his wandering in the court of King Alcinous.

== A set of stories ==

A frame story is a literary device that acts as a convenient conceit to organize a set of smaller narratives, either devised by the author or taken from a previous stock of popular tales, slightly altered by the author for the purpose of the longer narrative. Sometimes a story within the main narrative encapsulates some aspect of the framing story, in which case it is called a &quot;mise en abyme&quot;.

A typical frame story is &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, in which the character Scheherazade narrates a set of fairy tales to the Sultan Shahriyar over many nights. Many of Shahrazad&#x27;s tales are also frame stories, such as &quot;Tale of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman&quot;, a collection of adventures related by Sindbad the Seaman to Sindbad the Landsman.

Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; makes extensive use of framing, with the stories nested several deep, allowing the inclusion of many different tales in one work. Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; uses this literary device to tell the story of Heathcliff and Catherine, along with the subplots. Her sister Anne uses this device in her epistolary novel &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. The main heroine&#x27;s diary is framed by the narrator&#x27;s story and letters.

Mary Shelley&#x27;s novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; has multiple framed narratives. In the book, Robert Walton writes letters to his sister, describing the story told to him by the scientist Victor Frankenstein. Midway through Frankenstein&#x27;s story, he is met by the monster, who tells him his own story after he was created, and this third narrative even briefly contains the tale of a family whom he had been observing. This set of frame narratives that fit together is sometimes called a Chinese box narrative; other instances of this style of narrative can be found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposion&quot;, Jostein Gaarder&#x27;s &quot;The Solitaire Mystery&quot;, Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;.

Frame stories have appeared in comic books. Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot; featured a story arc called &quot;Worlds End&quot; which consisted of frame stories, and sometimes even featured stories within stories within stories. 

Sometimes, as in Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Sketch Book&quot;, which contains &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; and &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; among others, the conceit is that the author of the book is not the real author but a fictional character, in this case a man named Crayon. Here the frame includes the world of the imagined Crayon, his stories, and the reader who is assumed to play along and &quot;know&quot; who Crayon is.

== Single story ==
When there is a single story, the frame story is used for other purposes – chiefly to position the reader&#x27;s attitude toward the tale. This can be done in a variety of ways.

=== Casting doubt on the narrator ===
A common reason to frame one story is to draw attention to the narrator&#x27;s unreliability. By explicitly making the narrator a character within the frame story, the writer distances him or herself from the narrator. The writer may characterize the narrator to cast doubt on the narrator&#x27;s truthfulness, as when in P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s stories of Mr. Mulliner, Mulliner is made a fly fisherman, a person who is expected to tell tales of unbelievably large fish. The movie &quot;Amadeus&quot; is framed as a story that an old Antonio Salieri tells to a young priest, because the movie is based more on stories Salieri told about Mozart than on historical fact.

=== Procatalepsis ===
Another use is a form of procatalepsis, where the writer puts the readers&#x27; possible reactions to the story in the characters listening to it. In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; the frame of a grandfather reading the story to his reluctant grandson puts the cynical reaction a viewer might have to the romantic fairytale into the story in the grandson&#x27;s persona, and helps defuse it. This is the use when the frame tells a story that lacks a strong narrative hook in its opening; the narrator can engage the reader&#x27;s interest by telling the story to answer the curiosity of his listeners, or by warning them that the story began in an ordinary seeming way, but they must follow it to understand later actions, thereby identifying the reader&#x27;s wondering whether the story is worth reading to the listeners&#x27;. Such an approach was used, too, by Edith Wharton in her novella &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;, in which a nameless narrator hears from many characters in the town of Starkfield about the main character Ethan&#x27;s story.

=== Dream vision ===
A specialized form of the frame is a dream vision, where the narrator claims to have gone to sleep, dreamed the events of the story, and then awoken to tell the tale. In medieval Europe, this was a common device, used to indicate that the events included are fictional; Geoffrey Chaucer used it in &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;, &quot;The House of Fame&quot;, &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;, and &quot;The Legend of Good Women&quot; (the last also containing a multi-story frame story within the dream). Later, John Bunyan used a dream device in the Christian allegory &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and its sequel, explaining that they were dreams he had while he was in prison and felt God wanted him to write down. This worked because it made what might have been seen as a fantasy more like a divine revelation to others who believed as he did.

In modern usage, it is sometimes used in works of fantasy as a means toward suspension of disbelief about the marvels depicted in the story. J.R.R. Tolkien, in his essay &quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot; complained of such devices as unwillingness to treat the genre seriously; he used frame stories of different kinds in his Middle-earth writings. Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; stories (&quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;) includes such a frame, the stories themselves using dream-like logic and sequences. 

Still, even as the story proceeds realistically, the dream frame casts doubt on the events. In the book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the events really occur; the dream frame added for the movie detracts from the validity of the fantasy.

== Use ==
To be a frame narrative, the story must act primarily as an occasion for the telling of other stories. For example, Odysseus narrates much of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; to the Phaeacians, but, even though this recollection forms a great part of the poem, the events after and before the interpolated recollection are of greater interest than the memory.

A film that plays with frame narrative is the 1994 &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. Most of it is narrated by Forrest to various companions on the bus-stop bench. However, in the last fifth or so of the film, Forrest gets up and leaves the bench, and we follow him as he meets with Jenny and her son. This final segment suddenly has no narrator unlike the rest of the film that came before it, but is instead told through Forrest and Jenny&#x27;s dialogues.

This approach is also demonstrated in the 2008 film &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (adapted from the 2005 novel &quot;Q &amp; A&quot;), about a poor street kid named Jamal who comes close to winning &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot; (the Indian equivalent of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;) but finds himself accused of cheating. Most of the story is narrated at a police station by Jamal, who explains how he knew the answers to each of the questions as the show is played back on video. The show itself then serves as another framing device, as Jamal sees flashbacks of his past as each question is asked. The last portion of the film then unfolds without any narrator.

== Compared to reprise ==

In musical sonata form or rondo, a reprised theme occurs at the beginning and end of the work, or returns periodically. A framing device may take the form of a recurrent element at the beginning and end of the narrative. For example, a story may begin with a character visiting a park under one set of circumstances, then returning at the end to the same park under a different set of circumstances, having undergone a change that allows him or her to see the park in a new light.

A framing device might simply be a defining image of the narrative or art that is used at the beginning and end of the work, as in the film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; which begins and ends with the characters running along a beach, accompanied at both times by the movie&#x27;s famous theme music. This scene, although chronologically in the middle of the film and unimportant to the straightforward plot, serves to convey a defining emotion and tone that sets the context for the main story.

<doc id="659827" wikidata="Q7763979" url="?curid=659827" title="The Short North">
<text>The Short North is a neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, United States, centered on the main strip of High Street immediately north of the Arena District and extending until just south of the University District and Ohio State University. It is an easy walk from the convention center or Nationwide Arena district to the south, spanning the length of High Street from the north side of Goodale Street to the south side of 7th/King Avenue. It is flanked by Victorian Village to the west and Italian Village to the East. The Short North is a densely-populated commercial and residential district, with especially high pedestrian use during its monthly &quot;Gallery Hop&quot; and other local and downtown events.

The Short North has been described as &quot;colorful&quot;, &quot;offbeat&quot;, and &quot;trendy&quot;. The district is heavily populated with art galleries, specialty shops, pubs, nightclubs, and coffee shops. Most of its tightly packed brick buildings date from at least the early 20th century, with traditional storefronts along High Street (often with brightly painted murals on their side walls), and old apartment buildings and rowhouses and newer condominium developments in the surrounding blocks. The city installed 17 lighted metal arches extending across High Street throughout the Short North, reminiscent of such arches present in the area in the early 1900s.

==History==

Originally known as part of the &quot;near north side&quot;, the area along High Street began to be called the &quot;Short North&quot; as part of vernacular used by police and taxi drivers in the 1980s. This was a period of decline in the area, and from a suburban commuter&#x27;s perspective, the area had fallen &#x27;just short&#x27; of the central business district&#x27;s north end—both physically and economically. In 1981, the Short North Tavern opened in this area, the first to use this new name.

A reputation for diversity and an artistic, Bohemian atmosphere has marked the Short North, with land prices and local rents rising steadily from the humble beginnings as a squatter’s neighborhood in the 1980s. Prior to this gentrification of the neighborhood which originated from artists, it had suffered prolonged decay and from latent, street-level crime and gang violence as Columbus affluent residents followed the economic bubble outward—into the suburbs—during the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1980s saw the neighborhood&#x27;s rebirth enter into full gear as galleries began to open up and started to flourish. As Maria Gallowy (owner of PM gallery, formerly the oldest gallery in the Short North) once put it &quot;It was one of those neighborhoods that artists love to move into because the possibilities are there.&quot; In 1984 two Short North area galleries — the now defunct Art Reach and PM gallery — began opening new exhibits on the first Saturday of every month to help cross-promote their businesses and build a more unified community. This loose coordination later evolved into the Gallery Hop which is still held every first Saturday of the month. The Gallery Hop today features most businesses keeping their doors open late into the night, jam-packed streets, and sidewalks populated with street musicians and other performers.

Since 1983, the Short North has also hosted the annual Doo Dah Parade, a parody of typical Fourth of July parades that includes politically slanted paraders and floats as well as absurdities such as the &quot;Marching Fidels,&quot; a band of Fidel Castro lookalikes. The parade starts in neighboring Victorian Village, at Goodale Park, and winds north to finish coming south down High Street.

== Development==
The City of Columbus has designated the Short North, along with portions of Italian and Victorian Villages as a &quot;market ready&quot; Community Reinvestment Area, with available 15-year, 100 percent tax abatements if projects include 10 percent affordable housing, with options to buy out of the requirement.

Beginning around the turn of the millennium, the Short North has gone under a major period of construction and development. Major construction has turned previously small lots into ten-story buildings, sometimes taller, often with mixed residential, commercial, and office use. A construction at the 800 block of High Street completed in 2019 now houses the US headquarters for Swedish fintech Klarna, as well as two restaurants and a hotel operated by Marriott&#x27;s Moxy brand.

Some developers, such as the Wood Companies, have been active in the region for many years, and continuing to propose new buildings, such as a fifteen-story residential complex between Hubbard Ave and Wall Street. Further north, Stonewall Columbus has also involved itself in the redevelopment of the Short North, partnering with Black Gold Capital to propose a multi-story complex on the site of Stonewall&#x27;s current parking lot.

On June 23, 2023, ten people were shot and injured in a mass shooting on North High Street.

By 2024, as part of a study commissioned by an alliance of local businesses, two consulting firms, JS&amp;A Economic Development Consulting and Metris Arts Consulting, valued the entire Short North to have a total revenue of around $3.8 billion USD annually. The study further found that the entire neighborhood is valued at $954.9 million USD, generating just over $10 million in tax revenue per year.

<doc id="659833" wikidata="Q11253473" url="?curid=659833" title="Smart device">
<text>A smart device is an electronic device, generally connected to other devices or networks via different wireless protocols (such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, near-field communication, Wi-Fi, NearLink, Li-Fi, or 5G) that can operate to some extent interactively and autonomously. Several notable types of smart devices are smartphones, smart speakers, smart cars, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart locks, smart refrigerators, phablets and tablets, smartwatches, smart bands, smart keychains, smart glasses, and many others. The term can also refer to a device that exhibits some properties of ubiquitous computing, including—although not necessarily—machine learning. 

Smart devices can be designed to support a variety of form factors, a range of properties pertaining to ubiquitous computing and to be used in three main system environments: physical world, human-centered environments, and distributed computing environments. Smart homes indicate the presence of sensors and some detection devices, appliances, and a database to control them.

== Form factors ==
In 1991, Mark Weiser proposed three basic forms for ubiquitous system devices: tabs, pads and boards.
* &quot;Tabs&quot;: accompanied or wearable centimetre sized devices, e.g., smartphones, smart cards
* &quot;Pads&quot;: hand-held decimetre-sized devices, e.g., laptops
* &quot;Boards&quot;: meter sized interactive display devices, e.g., horizontal surface computers and vertical SMART boards.
These three forms proposed by Weiser are characterized by being macro-sized, having a planar form and by incorporating visual output displays. These were also envisioned more as information appliances. If each of these three characteristics is relaxed, this range can be expanded into a much more diverse and potentially more useful range of ubiquitous computing devices.

== Characteristics ==
Smart devices are typically composed of a hardware layer (including a radio that transmits signals), a network layer (through which devices communicate with each other), and an application layer (through which end users deliver commands). These layers often include the following characteristics:

* A set of system hardware &amp; software IT resources. This set is usually static, fixed at design time.
* Dynamic component-oriented resource extensions &amp; plug-ins (plug and play) of some hardware resources.
* Remote external service access and execution.
* Local, internal autonomous service execution.
* Access to specific external environments: human interaction, physical world interaction and distributed ICT / virtual computing interaction.
* Some ubiquitous computing properties.
Common types of smart devices include: 
*&quot;Tab&quot; and &quot;pad&quot; type smart devices that often act as personalized smart mobile devices
* Smart environment devices.

== Ubiquitous computing properties ==
Weiser&#x27;s vision for ubiquitous computing can be summarized in terms of two core properties:
* Devices need to be networked, distributed and transparently accessible.
* Human–computer interaction with devices is hidden to a degree from its users.

It is proposed that there are two additional core types of properties for ubiquitous computing systems: 
* Devices can operate to some extent autonomously, i.e., without human intervention, be self-governed.
* Devices can handle a multiplicity of dynamic actions and interactions, governed by intelligent decision-making and organisational interaction. This may entail some form of artificial intelligence in order to:
** handle incomplete and non-deterministic interactions
** cooperation and competition between members of organizations
** richer interaction through sharing of context, semantics and goals, etc.

However, it is hard to fix a closed set of properties that define all ubiquitous computing devices because of the sheer range and variety of ubiquitous computing research and applications. Rather than to propose a single definition for ubiquitous computing, a taxonomy of properties for ubiquitous computing has been proposed, from which different kinds or flavours of ubiquitous systems and applications can be composed and described.

== Environments ==
The term &quot;smart device environments&quot; has two meanings. First, it can refer to a greater variety of device environments. Three different kinds of environments for devices can be differentiated:
* &quot;Virtual computing environments&quot; that enable smart devices to access pertinent services anywhere and anytime.
* &quot;Physical environments&quot; that may be embedded with a variety of smart devices of different types including tags, sensors and controllers. These can have different form factors ranging from nano to micro to macro sized.
* &quot;Humans environments&quot;: humans, either individually or collectively, inherently form a smart environment for devices. However, humans may themselves be accompanied by smart devices such as mobile phones, use surface-mounted devices (wearable computing) and contain embedded devices (e.g., pacemakers to maintain a healthy heart operation).
Second, the term &quot;smart device environments&quot; can also refer to the concept of a smart environment which focuses more specifically on the physical environment of the device. The physical environment is smart because it is embedded or scattered with smart devices that can sense and control part of it.

<text>Virginia Ruth &quot;Jennie&quot; Lewis (; November 29, 1921 – October 9, 2001), known professionally as Dagmar, was an American actress, model, and television personality. In the 1950s she became one of the first major female stars of television, receiving much press coverage.

==Early life==
Egnor was born in Yawkey, West Virginia, and went to high school in Huntington, West Virginia, where she was known as Ruthie. She attended Huntington Business School and worked at Walgreens, in the West Virginia Building, as a cashier, waitress, sandwich maker, and soda jerk. After her marriage to Angelo Lewis in 1941, she moved to New York, where he was a naval officer stationed at Navy Ferry Command on Long Island.

==Broadway==
Egnor adopted Jennie Lewis as her stage name (taken from her real-life married name, Virginia Lewis). To keep herself busy, she became a fashion photographer&#x27;s model, and in 1944, other models encouraged her to audition for comedians Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson. Although she had no show business experience, she was cast in their Broadway musical revue, &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot;, a Shubert production at the Winter Garden Theatre. With Olsen and Johnson, she performed in four sketches from December 23, 1944, to July 14, 1945.

Playing a chorus girl named Bubbles, she appeared with Bert Lahr in the Broadway comedy &quot;Burlesque&quot;, which ran for 439 performances from December 25, 1946, until January 10, 1948. The play was set in the basement dressing-room of a midwest burlesque theater, a New York hotel suite, and a theater in Paterson, New Jersey.

==Television==
In 1950, when Lewis was hired by Jerry Lester for NBC&#x27;s first late-night show &quot;Broadway Open House&quot; (1950–51), he renamed her Dagmar. Lester devised the name as a satirical reference following the huge success on television of the TV series &quot;Mama&quot; (1949–1957), in which the younger sister, Dagmar Hansen, was portrayed by Robin Morgan. As Dagmar, Lewis was instructed to wear a low-cut gown, sit on a stool, and play the role of a stereotypical dumb blonde. With tight sweaters displaying the Lewis&#x27; curvy figure, her dim-bulb character was an immediate success, soon attracting much more attention than Lester. Lewis quickly showed that regardless of appearances, she was quite bright and quick-witted. Her appearances created a sensation, leading to much press coverage and a salary increase from $75 to $1,250. With Dagmar getting all the attention and Lester burned out from having to create new material five nights per week, Lester walked off his own show in May 1951, and Dagmar became the host until the show was cancelled in August 1951.
Dagmar became one of the leading personalities of early 1950s live television, doing sketch comedy on Milton Berle&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, the &quot;Bob Hope Show&quot;, and other shows. On June 17, 1951, she appeared on the &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; with host Eddie Cantor and guests Milton Berle, Phil Foster, and Jack Leonard. In 1951, she made a TV guest appearance with Frank Sinatra, which prompted Columbia Records producer Mitch Miller to record &quot;Mama Will Bark&quot;, a novelty duet between Sinatra and Dagmar. The record has often been considered one of the worst of his career; however, it made no. 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

Dagmar was featured in a &quot;Life&quot; cover story with Alfred Eisenstaedt&#x27;s photo of her on the July 16, 1951 issue. For the interior photo essay, &quot;Life&quot; photographers followed her to rehearsals and accompanied her on a vacation to her home town in West Virginia.

===&quot;Dagmar&#x27;s Canteen&quot;===
In 1952, she hosted the short-lived, late Saturday evening &quot;Dagmar&#x27;s Canteen&quot; (which aired on NBC at 12:15 am Eastern Time), in which she sang, danced, interviewed servicemen, and performed comedy routines. The basic premise of the show was that servicemen from the audience were given roles to act with Dagmar in sketches.

One of Dagmar&#x27;s sisters, Jean, was a member of the cast of &quot;Dagmar&#x27;s Canteen&quot;. Jean previously worked as a chorus girl on Broadway, and served as Dagmar&#x27;s secretary, handling her sister&#x27;s fan mail, which sometimes soared to 8,000 letters per month.

===Later career===
When her television show ended, Dagmar performed in Las Vegas shows and summer stock theater. Liberace spoke glowingly of her in an interview, stating that she had given him his big break as her accompanist early in his career. In the 1950s, Dagmar was a regular panelist on the game show &quot;Who Said That?&quot;, with H. V. Kaltenborn, Deems Taylor, Frank Conniff, Peggy Ann Garner, and Boris Karloff. She occasionally made guest appearances on such shows as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot;, and &quot;Masquerade Party&quot; (once disguised as John L. Lewis), and during the 1960s, she appeared on &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, and other shows.

Dagmar was one of a number of performers who posed for pictures in the Patrick Dennis novel &quot;First Lady&quot;, published in 1965, as the soubrette and presidential courtesan, Gladys Goldfoil.

In 1950s auto design, the slang term Dagmar bumper emerged to describe dual pointed chrome projections on the front ends of Cadillacs, Buicks, Packards, and other U.S. automobiles, an allusion to the actress&#x27;s physique and trademark attire.

==Personal life==
After her marriage to Angelo Lewis ended, she was married to actor Danny Dayton through much of the 1950s, and then to bandleader Dick Hinds in 1967. After years on the nightclub circuit, she moved to Ceredo, West Virginia, in June 1996 to be near her family. In her last years, she lived with her brother Bob Egnor and his wife. Dagmar died in Ceredo on October 9, 2001, of undisclosed causes, aged 79. In 2006, she was among the early people to be inducted into the newly formed West Virginia Broadcasting Hall of Fame at the Museum of Radio and Technology in Huntington, West Virginia.

<doc id="659845" wikidata="Q1666840" url="?curid=659845" title="International Race of Champions">
<text>International Race of Champions (IROC) was a North American auto racing competition, created by Les Richter, Roger Penske and Mike Phelps, promoted as an American-motorsports equivalent of an all-star game. Despite its name, IROC was primarily associated with North American oval track racing.

Drivers raced identically-prepared stock cars set up by a single team of mechanics in an effort to make the race purely a test of driver ability. It was run with a small field of 12 invited drivers. It was created and developed in 1972 by David Lockton, the developer of the Ontario Motor Speedway, launched in 1973, with Mark Donohue being the first driver to win the championship, in 1974. The cars used that year were Porsche Carrera RSRs. Donohue&#x27;s win in the fourth and last race of that season was his last win, as he died in a Formula One crash at the Österreichring in practice for the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix. The series was not run in 1981, 1982, or 1983.

In 2007, IROC could not find a sponsor and postponed the first two races, at Daytona and Texas. IROC went on hiatus in 2007 hoping to return with a sponsor in 2008, which did not happen. In March 2008, IROC auctioned off its tools, equipment, cars, and memorabilia, and went out of business. On January 8, 2024, Ray Evernham alongside Rob Kauffman announced the series would relaunch in 2024 with the intent of one race while exploring future opportunities afterwards.

==Drivers==

The drivers invited were from a broad range of racing disciplines: Indy cars, NASCAR, sports car racing, and on occasion, sprint car racing. Criteria for invitation was very loose, but typically consisted of recent season champions of the respective series, and individual winners of big events (Indy, Daytona, etc.) It was occasionally rumored that a top NHRA drag racer would be invited and compete, but none ever did.

Due to its fundamental stock car formula, and the majority of racing being contested on ovals, the series was often dominated by NASCAR participants (which was the major criticism of the series). Also, in the small field of about a dozen cars, the share of NASCAR invitees grew over time; from just three drivers in the first season to seven in the final season. The last non-NASCAR based champion of the series was Al Unser Jr. in 1988. Although open wheel drivers had numerous successes, , drivers from road racing series had only won two races in the history of IROC. In some years, no sports car drivers competed.

==Car identification==

Through 2003, IROC was also known for its rainbow of car colors being easily recognized from all other racing series. Car numbers were utilized for scoring purposes, but were not the primary means of identification. Instead, the driver&#x27;s surname would appear on the door of the car. Exceptions were made when Mario and Michael Andretti raced in the same events. In those cases, their first name was used. The numbers would change from race to race, with the number 1 being given to the driver starting first, and so on. The colors would correspond to the numbers. Before the races, drivers were assigned via blind drawing, as was how the starting grid for the first race was determined. The finishing order of the race would be inverted for the second race&#x27;s starting grid, while the reverse of the points standings determined races three and four&#x27;s grids. Numbers were assigned by the starting position. After the first race, the numbers were assigned based on points standings.

In 2004, the alcoholic beverage company, Diageo became the series&#x27; title sponsor, utilising their Crown Royal brand whiskey, replacing True Value, and the procedure changed as well. Cars would be identically painted in white, with trim which could be changed to represent the driver&#x27;s colors in his regular racing series. Also, a driver&#x27;s number in IROC would be his regular number. Thus, Steve Kinser would use green trim with the No.11, and Matt Kenseth&#x27;s car featured yellow trim with No.17.

The only exception to the numbering scheme involved the number 3. Following the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500, IROC retired the use of No.3. Any driver with that regular number would use No.03 instead. Hélio Castroneves raced with No.03, but the car kept red trim, in reflection of his IndyCar being red.

If there was a numbering conflict, another number would be substituted. In most cases, for one-digit numbers, a zero would be added in front. Otherwise a historically notable number would be run. (Penske drivers, for instance, could use No.66, owing to Mark Donohue.)

==Road racing==
From its inception to 1991, the series contested at least one race per season on a road course. Riverside held the most IROC road races, followed by Watkins Glen. Races were also contested at Mid-Ohio, the Daytona combined road course, and the Cleveland (Burke Lakefront Airport) CART series course.

From 1992 to 2005, the IROC season was exclusively run on ovals. In 2006, road courses were reintroduced to the IROC series with the cars competing on the road course at Daytona International Speedway. Also, in 2006, two drivers shared one car in an IROC first. Grand American Road Racing drivers Max Angelelli and Wayne Taylor each drove two races in 2006, trying to win the IROC title as a team, reflecting sportscar racing as a two-man team. However, in 2007, that may not have been used, as 2006 Grand American Road Racing champion Jörg Bergmeister was a solo champion. Bergmeister had to split driving duties with various drivers because his regular co-driver was forced to sit out three races because they were raced with the Indy Racing League; Colin Braun, who was 17, could not race in those three races under MSA rulings.

==Legacy==
The International Race of Champions series was beloved by NASCAR and international fans alike, as drivers from several different disciplines could be seen competing on a level playing field. During the hiatus of motorsports due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a group of drivers from NASCAR, NHRA, IndyCar, IMSA, Supercross, Supercars Championship, Formula One, and Rallycross competed in iRacing in dirt modifieds, GTE cars, and stock cars in an event dubbed a &quot;tribute to IROC&quot;.

In 2021, final IROC champion Tony Stewart and Ray Evernham launched Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) based on the IROC concept of identical cars and an all-star cast of drivers from different racing series.

==Points system==

===Purse===
==Champions==
*1985: Three races only as the third scheduled race was cancelled due to rain.
*1990: Three races only because of new sponsor Dodge and the late start to the season (Talladega, Cleveland, Michigan). After Darrell Waltrip was injured in a crash at Daytona in practice for the NASCAR Pepsi 400 the day before the Cleveland IROC race, he was not replaced for the final two races.
*1993: Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter crash after three races had been completed, and only the final race, at Michigan International Speedway, was remaining. Terry Labonte was asked to drive the final race, and Allison&#x27;s and Labonte&#x27;s points combined were enough for the IROC championship. Labonte&#x27;s winnings went to a trust fund for Allison&#x27;s two children, Krista and Robbie. Alan Kulwicki had been killed in a plane crash earlier in the year after two races had been run, and Dale Earnhardt was chosen to replace him to complete a 12-driver field, with all winnings going to charities chosen by the Kulwicki family.
*2001: After Dale Earnhardt was killed in the Daytona 500, IROC went to only eleven cars for the remaining three races. Following a 2004 rule change in IROC where drivers would be using their personal numbers, IROC added one exception – the number 3 could not be used. Any driver whose number in a series is 3 would have to have used 03 in IROC.
*2005: With the 2005 IROC title and the subsequent termination of the series, Martin now is the all-time leader in IROC Championship titles with five. Also during the 2005 season, Martin took over the all-time record for IROC wins with thirteen.

<doc id="659859" wikidata="Q725450" url="?curid=659859" title="Melanism">
<text>Melanism is the congenital excess of melanin in an organism resulting in dark pigment.

Pseudomelanism, also called abundism, is another variant of pigmentation, identifiable by dark spots or enlarged stripes, which cover a large part of the body of the animal, making it appear melanistic.

The morbid deposition of black matter, often of a malignant character causing pigmented tumors, is called melanosis.

==Adaptation==

Melanism related to the process of adaptation is called adaptive. Most commonly, dark individuals become fitter to survive and reproduce in their environment as they are better camouflaged. This makes some species less conspicuous to predators, while others, such as leopards, use it as a foraging advantage during night hunting. Typically, adaptive melanism is heritable: A dominant allele, which is entirely or nearly entirely expressed in the phenotype, is responsible for the excessive amount of melanin. By contrast, adaptive melanism associated with Batesian mimicry in Zelandoperla fenestrata stoneflies is controlled by a recessive allele at the ebony locus.

Adaptive melanism has been shown to occur in a variety of animals, including mammals such as squirrels, many cats and canids, and coral snakes. Adaptive melanism can lead to the creation of morphs, a notable example being the peppered moth, whose evolutionary history in the United Kingdom is offered as a classic instructional tool for teaching the principles of natural selection. A more replicated example of human-induced shifts in melanism has arisen from repeated selection against melanic Zelandoperla fenestrata stonefly phenotypes following widespread deforestation in New Zealand.
===Industrial melanism===
Industrial melanism is an evolutionary effect in insects such as the peppered moth, &quot;Biston betularia&quot; in areas subject to industrial pollution. Darker pigmented individuals are favored by natural selection, apparently because they are better camouflaged against polluted backgrounds. When pollution was later reduced, lighter forms regained the advantage and melanism became less frequent. Other explanations have been proposed, such as that the melanin pigment enhances function of immune defences, or a thermal advantage from the darker coloration.

==In cats==
Melanistic coat coloration occurs as a common polymorphism in 11 of 37 felid species and reaches high population frequency in some cases but never achieves complete fixation. The black panther, a melanistic leopard, is common in the equatorial rainforest of Malaya and the tropical rainforest on the slopes of some African mountains, such as Mount Kenya. The serval also has melanistic forms in certain areas of East Africa. In the jaguarundi, coloration varies from dark brown and gray to light reddish. Melanic forms of jaguar are common in certain parts of South America. In 1938 and 1940, two melanistic bobcats were trapped alive in sub-tropical Florida.
In 2003, the dominant mode of inheritance of melanism in jaguars was confirmed by performing phenotype-transmission analysis in a 116-individual captive pedigree. Melanistic animals were found to carry at least one copy of a mutant &quot;MC1R&quot; sequence allele, bearing a 15-base pair inframe deletion. Ten unrelated melanistic jaguars were either homozygous or heterozygous for this allele. A 24-base pair deletion causes the incompletely dominant allele for melanism in the jaguarundi. Sequencing of the agouti signalling peptide in the agouti gene coding region revealed a 2-base pair deletion in black domestic cats. These variants were absent in melanistic individuals of Geoffroy&#x27;s cat, oncilla, pampas cat and Asian golden cat, suggesting that melanism arose independently at least four times in the cat family.

Melanism in leopards is inherited as a Mendelian, monogenic recessive trait relative to the spotted form. Pairings of black animals have a significantly smaller litter size than other possible pairings. Between January 1996 and March 2009, Indochinese leopards were photographed at 16 sites in the Malay Peninsula in a sampling effort of more than 1000 trap nights. Of 445 photographs of melanistic leopards, 410 were taken south of the Kra Isthmus, where the non-melanistic morph was never photographed. These data suggest the near fixation of the dark allele in the region. The expected time to fixation of this recessive allele due to genetic drift alone ranged from about 1,100 years to about 100,000 years.
Melanism in leopards has been hypothesized to be causally associated with a selective advantage for ambush. Other theories are that genes for melanism in felines may provide resistance to viral infections, or a high-altitude adaptation, since black fur absorbs more light for warmth.

==In birds==
The chicken breeds Silkie and Ayam Cemani commonly exhibit this trait. Ayam Cemani is an uncommon and relatively modern breed of chicken from Indonesia. They have a dominant gene that causes hyperpigmentation (Fibromelanosis), making the chicken entirely black; including feathers, beak, and internal organs.

Melanism in feral rock doves is actually quite common, especially if the species is abundant in the area. The amount of pigmentation varies, from a slightly darker pigmentation in the pigeon’s wings, to being almost completely black.

In April 2015, an extremely rare black flamingo was spotted on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus.

==In amphibians==
The alpine salamander, &quot;Salamandra atra&quot;, has one subspecies (&quot;S. atra atra&quot;) that is completely black. The pigment comes from a specific cell called a melanophore, which produce the compound melanin.

There are four other subspecies of this salamander, and they have varying levels of melanin pigmentation. The subspecies have yellow spots in different concentrations or proportions. The pigment-producing cells that contribute to the yellow spots of some sub-species are called xanthophores. It appears that the fully-black phenotypes do not ever develop these xanthophores. Alpine salamanders produce a toxin from their skin, and both fully melanistic, black salamanders and spotted individuals produce the compound.

Studies done that traced DNA histories have suggested that the original alpine salamander phenotype was black with some yellow spots, meaning that the fully black color evolved over time and was thus selected for over many generations.

==In humans==
Melanism, meaning a mutation that results in completely dark skin, does not exist in humans. In humans, the amount of melanin is determined by three dominant alleles (AABBCC), and different ethnicities have varying amounts. Melanin is the primary determinant of the degree of skin pigmentation and protects the body from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The same ultraviolet radiation is essential for the synthesis of vitamin D in skin, so lighter colored skin – less melanin – is an adaptation related to the prehistoric movement of humans away from equatorial regions, as there is less exposure to sunlight at higher latitudes. People from Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and the Solomon Islands may have very dark skin, but this is not melanism.
===Peutz–Jeghers syndrome===

This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the development of macules with hyperpigmentation on the lips and oral mucosa (melanosis), as well as benign polyps in the gastrointestinal tract.

==Socio-politics==

The term &quot;melanism&quot; has been used on Usenet, internet forums and blogs to mean an African-American social movement holding that dark-skinned humans are the original people from which those of other skin color originate. The term &quot;melanism&quot; has been used in this context as early as the mid-1990s and was promoted by some Afrocentrists, such as Frances Cress Welsing.

<text>The second USS &quot;Sacramento&quot; (PG-19) was a gunboat in the United States Navy.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was launched on 21 February 1914 by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Shipbuilding Company, Philadelphia; sponsored by Miss Phebe Briggs; and commissioned on 26 April 1914 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard under the command of Commander Luke McNamee.

==Construction and design==
In 1911, it was decided to order a new gunboat as a cheaper alternative to the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Denver&quot;-class cruisers, designed to patrol in the Caribbean. The new ship would carry much less armament and not be able to carry troops, allowing a much smaller ship. Construction of the ship was authorized by Act of Congress on 4 March 1911, but no shipyard was willing to build the Navy&#x27;s design for the target cost of $500,000, and the Navy was forced to further reduce the design, cutting speed and range, before it could be ordered.

The final design was long overall and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . The ship was of flush decked design and was made of steel. Displacement was normal and full load. A single three-cylinder triple expansion engine, rated at , drove a single shaft, and were supplied with two Babcock &amp; Wilcox coal-fired water-tube boilers feeding steam at . This gave a contract speed of . 428 t of coal were carried, giving a range of .

The ship was armed with three 4-inch 50 calibre guns, with two 3-pounder saluting guns and two 1-pounder guns. The ship had a complement of 163 officers and men.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; (or Gunboat No. 19) was ordered from William Cramp &amp; Sons at a contract price of $492,500, and was laid down at Cramp&#x27;s Philadelphia shipyard on 30 April 1913. She was launched on 21 February 1914, and successfully met her contracted speed during sea trials on 31 March–1 April, reaching a maximum speed of and an average speed of on a 4-hour speed run. She was commissioned on 26 April 1914.

==Service history==

===World War I===
&quot;Sacramento&quot;″s first duty was in Mexican and Caribbean waters, and she arrived off Vera Cruz on 14 May 1914. &quot;Sacramento&quot; visited Dominican, Mexican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran ports repeatedly into 1916, protecting U.S. interests and observing uneasy local political conditions. Arriving at New Orleans on 17 March 1917, &quot;Sacramento&quot;″s crew assisted U.S. Customs authorities in taking over the interned German merchant vessels &quot;Breslau&quot;, &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Anna&quot;, &quot;Louise&quot;, and &quot;Teresa&quot; after the U.S. entered World War I.

Departing New Orleans on 15 April, &quot;Sacramento&quot; proceeded to Newport, Rhode Island, to commence patrol and escort duty off the New England coast. She rescued the crew of the burning British motor ship &quot;Sebastian&quot; on 8 May and vainly attempted to tow her to Newport, receiving commendation from the British government for her efforts. In late June, she took part in refloating the grounded cruiser .

Assigned to European waters, &quot;Sacramento&quot; departed New York on 22 July in company with a British mercantile convoy bound for Gibraltar, arriving on 6 August. As a unit of the U.S. Patrol Force based at Gibraltar, she performed continuous convoy escort duty to the British Isles with additional service along the North African and Italian coasts into 1918. Following the Armistice, &quot;Sacramento&quot; was ordered back to the U.S. She departed Gibraltar on 11 December 1918 for New Orleans.

===Inter-war period===
After completing repairs there, the gunboat steamed to New York prior to her next assignment with the U.S. Naval Forces, Northern Russia. &quot;Sacramento&quot; arrived at Murmansk on 22 May 1919; and, through July, served as a dispatch ship, distributed food and clothing, provided medical help, and assisted in the withdrawal of American forces from areas bordering the White Sea. Subsequently, sailing southward, &quot;Sacramento&quot; called at Norwegian, British, and French ports before arriving at Gibraltar on 20 September to assist in demobilizing the naval forces there. She returned to Hampton Roads, on 15 February 1920 to join the Atlantic Patrol Force and Special Service Squadron.

Designated PG-19 on 17 July 1920, Sacramento&#x27;s new assignment took her back to Caribbean waters where she spent considerable time cruising off troubled Honduras.

====Asiatic Squadron====
She was reassigned to the Asiatic Squadron in 1922, and departed Charleston, South Carolina, on 12 June &quot;en route&quot; for the Philippine Islands. Passing through the Mediterranean and transiting the Suez Canal, &quot;Sacramento&quot; called at Bombay, Colombo, and Singapore while progressing eastward to Manila. Her Asiatic Fleet service was spent largely in Chinese and Japanese ports but included a visit to Vladivostok, Russia from 11 September-24 November 1922. She remained on station until 21 December 1928, when she departed Cavite for Caribbean duty.

She sailed first to Mare Island, California, then joined the Special Service Squadron and cruised the Caribbean, calling at Central American and West Indies ports, into 1932. She departed Balboa, Canal Zone, on 11 January 1932 bound for San Diego and San Francisco, preparatory to crossing the Pacific for duty with the Asiatic Fleet. She arrived at Shanghai, China, on 1 April 1932 and remained in adjacent waters throughout the gradually worsening crisis, just short of war, during the rest of the 1930s. With other U.S. forces, she helped to protect national interests during this period. Ordered home toward the end of the decade, the veteran gunboat departed Cavite on 12 January 1939 for New York, via the Mediterranean. She earned the nickname &quot;the Galloping Ghost of the China Coast&quot;.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; served as a training ship for 9th Naval District Reservists, on the Great Lakes, from 20 November 1939 into 1940. Returning to the Boston Navy Yard for refitting, she subsequently departed the Norfolk Navy Yard &quot;en route&quot; to her next assignment in the Hawaiian Islands.

===World War II===
Entering Pearl Harbor on 15 August 1941, she was assigned to the Naval Coastal Force of the 14th Naval District, with fellow gunboat and U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats &quot;Reliance&quot; and &quot;Tiger&quot;. At the time of the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941, &quot;Sacramento&quot; was berthed in the Navy Yard&#x27;s repair berth B-6, with destroyers and nested beside her. &quot;Sacramento&quot;&#x27;s battle stations were manned by 08:00; two minutes later, her gun crews opened fire on Japanese aircraft attacking &quot;Battleship Row&quot; off Ford Island. Her batteries assisted in destroying one enemy plane which crossed her bow ahead and later helped down another which was pressing home an attack on . Her boat crews participated in rescue and salvage operations throughout the aftermath of the battle.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; patrolled the Hawaiian Sea Frontier out of Pearl Harbor until 27 September 1942, when she commenced service as a tender for Torpedo Boat Unit 6, Division 2, of MTBRon 1, at Palmyra Island, south of Hawaii; with additional duty as air-sea rescue vessel for the Naval Air Station. She departed Palmyra on 25 November for San Diego and duty with the Western Sea Frontier patrol force. There she trained gun crews from December of that year to March 1945. Based at San Francisco thereafter, &quot;Sacramento&quot; operated on weather patrol and plane guard station for the remainder of World War II.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was decommissioned on 6 February 1946 at Suisun Bay, California, and simultaneously transferred to the War Shipping Administration for disposal. She was sold on 23 August 1947 for mercantile service, initially operating under Italian registry as Fermina.

<text>The Stanford Chaparral (also known as the Chappie) is a humor magazine published by students of Stanford University since 1899.

==History==
The &quot;Stanford Chaparral&quot; was established in 1899 by Bristow Adams and Larrey Bowman. Published for more than 124 years, the &quot;Chappie&quot; is the third oldest continually published humor magazine in the world after &quot;Nebelspalter&quot; (1875–present) and the &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; (1876–present). The magazine&#x27;s most recent brush with the national media was its feature in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; by Evan Ratliff.

==Traditions==
The &quot;Chappie&quot; is published six times during the academic year, or twice per quarter. There are a number of traditional issues, such as the Freshman Number published at the beginning of the school year, and the Big Game Number published on the week of the longstanding football matchup between Stanford and The University of California, Berkeley. In the early Spring, the &quot;Chaparral&quot; traditionally publishes an annual satire of &quot;The Stanford Daily&quot;, popularly termed the &quot;Fake Daily.&quot;

During the annual elections for student government, two of the magazine&#x27;s writers traditionally run for president and vice-president of the student body. Despite running as a joke, candidates have won the executive race in the past.

==Chaparral alumni==

<doc id="659884" wikidata="Q1729637" url="?curid=659884" title="Alan Plater">
<text>Alan Frederick Plater (15 April 1935 – 25 June 2010) was an English playwright and screenwriter, who worked extensively in British television from the 1960s to the 2000s. He is best known for the sitcom &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot; and the comedy drama serials &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot;.

==Career==
Plater was born in Jarrow, County Durham, although his family moved to Hull in 1938. 
He attended Kingston High School.

Jarrow was much publicised as a severely economically depressed area before the Second World War (Plater joked that his family left Jarrow just after the Great Depression to catch Hull just before the Blitz). He trained as an architect at King&#x27;s College, Newcastle (later the Newcastle University School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape), but only practised in the profession briefly, at a junior level. He later stated that it was shortly after he was forced to fend off a herd of pigs from eating his tape measure while he was surveying a field that he left to pursue writing full-time. Plater stayed in the north of England for many years after he became prominent as a writer and lived in Hull.

He first made his mark as a scriptwriter for &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1962–65), along with its spin-offs &quot;Softly, Softly&quot; (1966–69) and &quot;Softly, Softly: Task Force&quot; (1969–76). His subsequent credits include &quot;The Reluctant Juggler&quot; in the series &quot;The Edwardians&quot; (1972), &quot;Shoulder to Shoulder&quot; (1974), &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; (1975), &quot;Trinity Tales&quot; (1975), &quot;Oh No It&#x27;s Selwyn Froggitt&quot;, &quot;The Journal of Vasilije Bogdanovic&quot;, the musical &quot;Close the Coalhouse Door&quot; with songwriter Alex Glasgow from the writings of Sid Chaplin, &quot;Get Lost!&quot; (1981), &quot;On Your Way, Riley&quot; (1982), &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; (1987) an adaptation based on the novels of Olivia Manning, &quot;The Beiderbecke Trilogy&quot; (1985–1988), &quot;Misterioso&quot; (an adaptation of his novel, 1991), &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1995), an adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1980) for Yorkshire Television, a film adaptation of George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot;, &quot;Belonging&quot; and the theatre play &quot;Peggy for You&quot;, based on the life of Plater&#x27;s former agent Peggy Ramsay, which was nominated in 2001 for a Laurence Olivier Theatre Award.

He also contributed to the BBC series &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, and adapted Chris Mullin&#x27;s novel &quot;A Very British Coup&quot; (1988) for television. He was the driving force behind the TV version of &quot;Flambards&quot;, which under his influence was claimed to be slanted well to the political left of K. M. Peyton&#x27;s original books. Jazz is a recurring motif through much of Plater&#x27;s work, often referenced explicitly as well as underpinning his story structures. Among his few feature films he collaborated twice with Christopher Miles on two successful D. H. Lawrence projects &quot;The Virgin and the Gypsy&quot; and &quot;Priest of Love&quot;.

He was a supporter of Hull City A.F.C. His play &quot;Confessions of a City Supporter&quot; on his lifelong relationship with the club was staged during the first-ever run of performances at the new home of the Hull Truck Theatre Company.

==Plater on his own work==

In an interview with Richard Whiteley, Plater claimed he had never intended to write sensational plot-driven sagas with outlandish characters and that he had never intended to make the sort of &quot;rubbish programmes featuring high-speed car crashes of which there are too many on television&quot;. Plater said that he had always tried to make his characters normal people, whose normal lives are interrupted when the outside world comes into their lives.

Plater claimed his two best-known characters, Trevor Chaplin and Jill Swinburne in the &quot;Beiderbecke&quot; series, were based on himself. Trevor represented his personal interests, jazz, football and snooker (the parallel of someone from the northeast in Yorkshire also fitted) while Jill represented his political beliefs such as conservationism, environmentalism and socialism. The couple were based on his earlier characters of Neville Keaton and Judy Threadgold in &quot;Get Lost!&quot; (1981).

==Personal life and honours==
Plater was married to Shirley Johnson (1958–85), with whom he had two sons and a daughter, and later Shirley Rubinstein (from 1986) gaining three stepsons.

Plater was president of the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain from September 1991 until April 1995. He received honorary degrees from the University of Hull and Northumbria University in Newcastle. In the New Year&#x27;s Honours List published 31 December 2004, he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to drama. He is commemorated with a green plaque on The Avenues, Kingston upon Hull.

==Death==
Plater died of cancer at a London hospice, aged 75. His death was announced on 25 June 2010.

<doc id="659890" wikidata="Q1530639" url="?curid=659890" title="Richard Jaeckel">
<text>Richard Jaeckel (born R. Hanley Jaeckel; October 10, 1926 – June 14, 1997) was an American actor of film and television. Jaeckel became a well-known character actor in his career, which spanned six decades. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor with his role in the 1971 adaptation of Ken Kesey&#x27;s &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot;.

==Early years==
Jaeckel was born October 10, 1926, in Long Beach, New York, the son of Richard Jaeckel and Millicent Hanley. His father was active in the family&#x27;s fur business, and his mother was a stage actress. His birth name was R. Hanley Jaeckel, with only the initial rather than a first name. He attended The Harvey School and other private schools. The family lived in New York until 1934, when they moved to Los Angeles, where his father operated a branch of the family business. He graduated from Hollywood High School.

==Career==

A short, tough man, Jaeckel played a variety of characters during his 50 years in films and television. Jaeckel got his start in the business at the age of seventeen while he was employed as a mailboy at 20th Century Fox studios in Hollywood. A casting director auditioned him for a role in the 1943 film &quot;Guadalcanal Diary&quot;; Jaeckel won the role and settled into a lengthy career in supporting parts.

He served in the United States Merchant Marine from 1944 to 1946, then starred in two of the most remembered war films of 1949: &quot;Battleground&quot; and &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; with John Wayne. One of Jaeckel&#x27;s shortest film roles was in &quot;The Gunfighter&quot;, in which his character is killed by Gregory Peck&#x27;s character in the opening scene. He played the role of Turk, the roomer&#x27;s boyfriend, in the Academy Award-winning 1952 film &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba&quot;, with Shirley Booth, Burt Lancaster, and Terry Moore.

In 1960, he appeared as Angus Pierce in the Western, &quot;Flaming Star&quot;, starring Elvis Presley. He played Lee Marvin&#x27;s able second-in-command, Sgt. Bowren, in the 1967 film &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; for director Robert Aldrich, and reprised the role in the 1985 sequel, &quot;The Dirty Dozen: Next Mission&quot;. Jaeckel appeared in several other Aldrich films, including Big Leaguer (1953), &quot;Attack&quot; (1956), &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; (1972), and &quot;Twilight&#x27;s Last Gleaming&quot; (1977).

He guest-starred in many television programs. He was cast as a boxer in a 1954 episode of Reed Hadley&#x27;s CBS legal drama, &quot;The Public Defender&quot;. Also in 1954, Jaeckel portrayed Billy the Kid in an episode of the syndicated Western anthology series, &quot;Stories of the Century&quot;, with Jim Davis as the fictitious Southwest Railroad detective Matt Clark.
Seven years later, Jaeckel played &quot;Denver&quot; in &quot;The Grudge Fight&quot; episode of the NBC Western series &quot;The Tall Man&quot;.

In 1957, he appeared as Mort Claffey in two episodes, &quot;Paratroop Padre&quot; and &quot;The Light,&quot; of the syndicated religion anthology series, &quot;Crossroads&quot;. That same year, he portrayed Lieutenant Bradshaw in episode &quot;War of the Whale Boats&quot; of the military drama, &quot;Navy Log&quot;. In 1956-57, he appeared in three episodes of another military drama, &quot;The West Point Story&quot;.

In 1955 and 1958, Jaeckel appeared in different roles on two episodes of CBS&#x27;s fantasy drama &quot;The Millionaire&quot;. In 1958, Jaeckel guest-starred as Webb Martin in the episode &quot;The Bloodline&quot; of NBC&#x27;s Western series &quot;Cimarron City&quot;. That same year, he appeared in the syndicated drama of the American Civil War, &quot;Gray Ghost&quot; in the episode entitled &quot;The Hero&quot;. In 1959, he was cast as Clint Gleason in episode &quot;The Man Behind the Star&quot; of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Texan&quot; Western series, starring Rory Calhoun.

In 1960, Jaeckel appeared twice on Nick Adams&#x27;s ABC Western series, &quot;The Rebel&quot;, as Marshal Roader in &quot;The Rattler&quot; and as Clyde Traskel in &quot;Run, Killer, Run&quot;. 
During the 1961-62 season, Jaeckel had a starring role (with John Derek and Chill Wills) on CBS&#x27; Frontier Circus, an adventure drama about a one-ring circus traveling the American West during the 1880&#x27;s. Jaeckel&#x27;s character Tony Gentry served as an advance location scout for the circus in addition to assisting John Derek&#x27;s circus manager Ben Travis. Jaeckel appeared in all 26 episodes with featured player roles in several episodes, most notably &quot;Karina&quot; opposite Elizabeth Montgomery.

In 1963, Jaeckel played Willie the murderer in &quot;The Case of the Lover&#x27;s Leap&quot; on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, starring Raymond Burr. That same year he was among the guest stars on the short-lived ABC/Warner Brothers Western series, &quot;The Dakotas&quot; and in &quot;The Predators&quot; episode of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, Season 6 (1962). Also in 1963, Jaeckel, speaking in German, played the role of Wehrmacht Sgt. Buxman in the &quot;Combat!&quot; TV series episode &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Army.&quot; Finally in that year, he guest starred in the TV Western Series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; in the S8E27 episode &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;, playing Irish immigrant mine owner O’Ryan, who was feuding with his partner. Jaeckel appeared in Alfred Hitchcock Presents &quot;Incident in a Small Jail&quot; (1961) as well as The Alfred Hitchcock Hour episodes, &quot;Low Clouds and Coastal Fog&quot; (1963), &quot;Death of a Cop (1963), and &quot;Off Season&quot; (1965). In 1964, Jaeckel appeared as Danny in the episode &quot;Keep Cool&quot; of &quot;The New Phil Silvers Show&quot; and as Mitch Devlin in an episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, ″Between Heaven and Earth″.

In 1966, Jaeckel made a second guest appearance on &quot;Perry Mason&quot; as Mike Woods in the episode &quot;The Case of the Bogus Buccaneers&quot;. That same year, he also co-starred as Christopher Cable in an episode – &quot;The Night of the Grand Emir&quot; – of &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. Also that year he played “Percy Farley”, part of a bank robbing gang in a rare two part episode called “The Raid” on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. He guest-starred in 1967 as Dibbs in the episode &quot;Night of Reckoning&quot; on &quot;Bonanza&quot;.

Jaeckel&#x27;s most famous film appearances of the 1950s are in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (1957) and &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; (1958). His film career achieved its greatest success in the period 1967 to 1975, in such features as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968), &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970), &quot;Sometimes a Great Notion&quot; (1971) (for which he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor), &quot;Ulzana&#x27;s Raid&quot; (1972), &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973), &quot;The Outfit&quot; (1973), &quot;The Drowning Pool&quot; (1975), and &quot;Walking Tall Part 2&quot; (1975). &quot;Chisum&quot; was a John Wayne vehicle in which Jaeckel, Christopher George and Andrew Prine all co-starred in prominent supporting roles. The three would re-team six years later in &quot;Grizzly&quot; (1976) (an amiable &quot;Jaws&quot; ripoff reset in the forest), and Jaeckel and George would team again in another &quot;nature strikes back&quot; story, &quot;Day of the Animals&quot; (1977). In 1976, he starred in the B movie &quot;&quot;.

In 1975, he starred as the title character on the episode “Larkin” on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (S20E17). In 1977, Jaeckel appeared with Donna Mills, Bill Bixby, and William Shatner in the last episode, entitled &quot;The Scarlet Ribbon&quot;, of NBC&#x27;s Western series &quot;The Oregon Trail&quot;, starring Rod Taylor and Andrew Stevens. The following year he played Sergeant Lykes in the epic TV miniseries &quot;Centennial&quot;.
He had a recurring role in the short-lived Andy Griffith vehicle &quot;Salvage 1&quot; (1979).

The later films in his career included a major role in John Carpenter&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Starman&quot; as an NSA agent hunting an alien life form played by Jeff Bridges as well as in the action films &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot; with Tommy Lee Jones and &quot;Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection&quot; with Chuck Norris. In his later years, Jaeckel was known to television audiences as Lt. Ben Edwards on &quot;Baywatch&quot; from seasons 2-4. He also played Al Gibson in the Baywatch Pilot. He also co-starred on Robert Urich&#x27;s ABC series &quot;&quot; in the role of Lieutenant Martin Quirk.

<text>German Village is a historic neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio, just south of the city&#x27;s downtown. It was settled in the early-to-mid-19th century by a large number of German immigrants, who at one time comprised as much as a third of the city&#x27;s entire population. It became a city historic district in 1960 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, becoming the list&#x27;s largest privately funded preservation district, and in 2007, was made a Preserve America Community by the federal government. In 1980, its boundaries increased, and today it is one of the world&#x27;s premier historic restorations.

==History==
===Early===
In 1796, Congress appropriated the Refugee Lands for Canadian province individuals who had supported the Colonial cause in the American Revolution. By 1802, an American Revolution veteran named John McGowan claimed , most of what would become the German Village. As German immigrants arrived, McGowan sold tracts of land to them. By 1814, a settlement had grown up, originally called &quot;Das Alte Südende&quot; (the Old South End), and German immigrants contributed to building the first statehouse.

====Immigration====

By 1830, massive German immigration to the city had occurred. The most influential German newspaper in 1843 was &quot;Der Westbote&quot;. Many immigrants from Germany would serve in the American Civil War, thus gaining the universal respect of the local citizens. By 1865, one-third of Columbus&#x27;s population was German and the community was flourishing. They built up the local neighborhood, including many businesses, such as Hessenauer Jewelers and Lazarus Department Stores, schools, and churches, such as the Ohio-historic St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, built in 1865 and adorned with a steeple in 1893. German-American George J. Karb became mayor of the city, twice, at the end of the 19th century and again in the early 20th century.

During the early 20th century, the south end saw newcomers from eastern Europe aside from German immigrants, resulting in brother neighborhoods such as the Hungarian Village.

The local schools the German immigrants constructed and managed were so superior that English-speaking residents of Columbus chose to attend them, such as one that once stood at Fulton Street east of S. Fourth Street.

====World War I====

The area was in serious decline throughout the first half of the 20th century, partly due to anti-German sentiment during World War I. During that time, the teaching of German in public schools was banned and German textbooks were burned. German street names were changed, such as Germania Street becoming the present-day Stewart Avenue, and Schiller Park was temporarily renamed Washington Park. The anti-German sentiment fueled by the media was so bad that in 1918, German books were burned on Broad Street and at the foot of the Schiller statue. German canine breeds were taken from their owners and slaughtered before being thrown into a pit in Schiller Park, including Dachshunds. Despite the hatred, the Columbus German American community would produce one of America&#x27;s finest heroes from the war, Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, for whom Rickenbacker International Airport in southern Columbus is named.

====Declared slum====
Further decline occurred later due to the closing of the local breweries during Prohibition. After the war, the south end was zoned for manufacturing, leading to the erosion of the area&#x27;s residential feel. In World War II, the streetcar tracks and wrought-iron fences were confiscated for the war effort. By the 1950s, the area had become a slum and the city decided to demolish one-third of the neighborhood.

===Renewal===
====Frank Fetch====
With the Village nearing complete destruction, Frank Fetch defied the common wisdom and purchased a house on S. Wall Street, determined to rebuild the neighborhood. Fetch would create the German Village Society. In June 1960, the society hosted the first Haus und Garten Tour, which attracted visitors and the local media to eight restored homes and two gardens. Today, the tour is one of the city&#x27;s most popular events. Frank Fetch Park was named after him.

====Historic preservation====
Concerned citizens managed to save its historic architecture from demolition in the 1960s by lobbying for a local commission, the German Village Commission, to have power over external changes made to buildings and by getting the area listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. , the German Village Society has over 1,000 preservationists who maintain the historic quality of the buildings and neighborhood, and German Village is considered one of the most desirable areas to live in the city. More than 1,600 buildings have been restored since 1960 and it is credited as one of the world&#x27;s premiere restoration districts. By the 1980s, the restoration was nearly complete. Today, it is the largest privately funded historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Modern===

The area is mostly a residential neighborhood of sturdy, red-brick homes with wrought iron fences along tree-lined, brick-paved streets.

The German Village Guest House has been recognized as one of the best in the Midwest by the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;, and the &quot;St. Louis Post Dispatch&quot;, and positively reviewed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Tennessean&quot;. It was rated as the &quot;Best Columbus Hotel 2010&quot; by City Search.

In 2007, German Village was recognized by the White House as a Preserve America Community.

====Oktoberfest====
German tradition has long reigned in the community in the form of an annual Oktoberfest festival. It originally took place in Schiller Park and has been held at various locations within the German Village neighborhood. Due to new development in the area, it now takes place at the Ohio State Fairgrounds / Ohio Expo Center. The festival was voted to be canceled in 2009, but the Schmidt (owners and operators of Schmidt&#x27;s Sausage Haus) and Cox families stepped in to keep it running.
A smaller Oktoberfest still goes on in the German Village itself, at the Germania Gesang und Sport Verein (Singing and Sports Club) at 543 South Front Street in the old Schlee Brewmaster&#x27;s House and outdoor garden.

====LGBTQ community====
Although German Village is an eclectic community, the area is known as a residential gay village. While there are no gay establishments within German Village, the neighboring Brewery District and Merion Village have several.

==Geography==
===Boundaries===

German Village is bound by Pearl Street on the west; East Livingston Avenue on the north; Lathrop Street, Brust Street, Grant Avenue, Jaeger Street, and Blackberry Alley on the east; and Nursery Lane on the south.

===Parks and landmarks===

Schiller Park, named after Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller (1759-1805), was once a community meeting ground for German immigrants. It is now the site of recreational facilities, gardens, and an amphitheater that hosts free live performances of Shakespearean plays during the summer months courtesy of Actors&#x27; Theatre of Columbus. It is bounded by Jaeger Street and City Park, Reinhard, and Deshler Avenues. It has been the area&#x27;s center for festivals and neighborhood activities since the 1800s.

The 23-acre park&#x27;s main entrance, along City Park Avenue, greets visitors with the Huntington Gardens, sponsored by Huntington National Bank and maintained by volunteers, and the Schiller statue. The statue was presented to the park by local residents in 1891. It is a second casting of the statue in Munich, Germany, designed and executed by Max von Widnmann and unveiled on May 9, 1863. The Columbus statue was transported free of charge across the Atlantic. The park is also home to &quot;Umbrella Girl&quot;, dedicated to the citizens of German Village in October 1996 to replace the missing original sculpture.

The neighborhood&#x27;s Stewart Alternative Elementary School, was built in 1874. It is one of the oldest remaining school buildings in Columbus, built at the same time as the First and Second Avenue Schools, also still extant.

===Residential===
The houses of German Village are settled close together on narrow plots. The area was originally settled mostly residential with commercial buildings scattered throughout. To keep this highly residential feel, the German Village Society has the area rezoned from manufacturing and commercial to high-density residential. The houses have small or no front yards, emphasizing local parks and gardens. The average home price in 2021 was $377,450. Several homes in the neighborhood are priced at over $1 million, including a home that sold in August 2007 for $1.5 million. Another home, which was purchased for $1.4 million in 2006, boasts an underground tunnel linking the main house with the garage, which also serves as an art and wine cellar.

==Commerce==
===Restaurants and bars===
German Village has a commercial strip mainly centered along S. Third Street, with mostly locally owned restaurants such as Katzinger&#x27;s Delicatessen, Schmidt&#x27;s Sausage Haus, and Schmidt&#x27;s Fudge Haus. The Schmidt&#x27;s establishments have been a part of German Village for 120 years, opened by George F. Schmidt. The restaurant is still run by the family, and was featured on &quot;Man vs. Food&quot; in 2008. Thurman Café—home to the &quot;Thurmanator&quot; eating challenge—was opened in German Village in 1942 by Nick Suclescy. The café and its Thurmanator challenge was featured on &quot;Man vs. Food&quot; in 2008. Katzinger&#x27;s Delicatessen is another family owned restaurant that opened in 1984 and is known for their deli sandwiches.
German Village was the home of the first restaurant in the Max &amp; Erma&#x27;s chain. In 1972, the restaurant was opened by Barry Zacks. The name was adopted from the original tavern, started in 1958 by Max and Erma Visocnik, which the new owners converted into the popular theme restaurant. The location closed in 2017 due to financial difficulties.

Many of the neighborhood&#x27;s restaurants won 2010 ThisWeek Community Papers awards, including Skillet which won &quot;Best New Restaurant&quot;, and Thurman Café for &quot;Best Burgers&quot;. Barcelona, noted for its Spanish cuisine, won for Best Patio and is a consistent &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; best city restaurant. Lindey&#x27;s was runner-up for the same award that year and was voted one of Columbus&#x27;s top 10 restaurants for 18 years straight. It has appeared previously in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine. In 2010, Max &amp; Erma&#x27;s was runner up for Best Casual Restaurant and Best Soups, Pistacia Vera runner-up for Best Desserts, and Roosters won Best Wings.

===Retail===
The neighborhood is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest producers of stained glass, the Franklin Art Glass Studios Inc., as well as several art galleries including the Archive Gallery, Hawk Galleries, Keny Gallery, and Kight Studio 551. Shops catering to European-imported retail include Caterina Ltd.

German Village is houses a few unique shops including the 32-room The Book Loft of German Village, a pre-Civil War-era style bookstore; Hausfrau Haven–a wine and gift shop; and several art galleries. There are also some import shops, which once included Caterina&#x27;s Ltd., selling European housewares, but is now permanently closed.

==Miscellaneous==
===America&#x27;s Great Places===
In 2011, German Village was named as one of America&#x27;s Great Places in the Neighborhoods category by the American Planning Association. Their description reads, &quot;Unpretentious, renovated houses and cottages stand shoulder to shoulder. Small, meticulously maintained front yards front tree-lined streets with brick sidewalks and cultivated village planters. Small businesses and storefronts with eye-catching displays and the aroma of culinary delights draw in passing pedestrians. German Village has remained true to its mid-19th century history, architecture, and character despite periods of disinvestment, decline, and near ruin.&quot;.

===German Brewery District===
A prosperous industry for the German immigrants was the brewing industry. Today, the Brewery District, part of the greater German Village neighborhood, still partially resembles its notable past. During the 19th century, the area was found largely along both sides of S. Front Street from Livingston Avenue to Sycamore Street.

Notable breweries during this period included the Bavarian Brewery, started in 1849 by George Schlegel, which ultimately became the Shlegel Bavarian Brewery in 1860 when Bavarian Nicholas Schlee immigrated and took over. Schlee was president of the company that eventually constructed the Great Southern Hotel downtown. Schlee also owned the Lyceum Theater and served as vice president of the Central Bank. Conrad Born opened the Capital Brewery in 1859 and was also president of the Century Discount Company. The industry flourished during the early 20th century.

One of the last major brewers of the city before Prohibition was August Wagner, who immigrated from Bavaria in the late 19th century and worked as the brewmaster at the City Brewery before becoming president and general manager of the Gambrinus Brewing Company. By 1919, he had purchased all of the stock for the company to become the sole owner, and in 1938 he changed the name to August Wagner Breweries, Inc. He was known to parade around on a horse costumed as Gambrinus, the patron saint of beer. A statue of Gambrinus is located at 605 S. Front Street.

Twenty-nine breweries have existed in and around the village throughout its history.

===Hoster Brewing Company legacy===

While English breweries were found originally in the city, as German immigrants moved in, their brewing techniques were universally embraced and became the dominant methods for producing beer. Louis Hoster, an immigrant from Rheinpfalz, Germany, is notably credited for this transformation when he opened the City Brewery in the 1830s. He would go on to serve on the City Council between 1846 and 1854 while establishing the city&#x27;s first wollen mill in 1852. In 1864, he established the Louis Hoster &amp; Sons Brewery, which became the Hoster Columbus Associated Breweries in 1904. He would also serve on the Board of Education and was a Unionist Democrat.

Later members of Louis Hoster&#x27;s brewing dynasty included his son Louis Philip Hoster, president of the Columbus Structural Steel Company, and Herman Hoster, son of Louis&#x27;s son George, a graduate of Yale University, treasurer of Hoster Columbus Associated Breweries, and founder of the Columbus Envelope Company. Another son of George was Carl J. Hoster, graduate of Cornell University, who was President of the Hoster Columbus Associated Breweries as well as the Director of the Hayden Clinton National Bank and Columbus Driving Park Association, President of the U.S. Brewer&#x27;s Association, 32nd degree of the Scottish Rite, and great-great uncle of former U.S. President George W. Bush.

Hoster Street in the German Village stretches six blocks between Lazelle and S. Front Streets.

===Capital University===
In 1831, the German Evangelical Lutheran Seminary secured in the south end, founded by William Schmidt, a graduate of the University of Halle in Germany. The school would go on to become what is known today as Capital University, still under the leadership of the Lutheran Church and now located in nearby Bexley.

===The arts and athletics===
The German immigrants brought with them a vibrant athletic and artistic heritage, which was reflected in their social establishments. The Columbus Maennerchor, a singing group, was established in 1848, and as early as 1852, won a ribbon for their talent at the North American Sangerfest. In 1866, the group won the silver &quot;pokal&quot; at a festival held in Louisville. In the late 19th century, another singing group called the Columbus Liederkranz was formed by the Germans, but was forced to cease during World War I because of heavy anti-German pressure. Many of its members joined the Maennerchor, which survived.

In the 1860s and 1870s the Maennerchor formed a drama division called the &quot;Dramatischen Sektion.&quot; They would produce operas, dramas, and comedies until disbanding in the 1930s. One of their notable performances was their 1927 production of Friedrich von Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Die Räuber&quot;. Another social group was the Schiller Club, founded in 1900.

The Columbus Turn Verein was a social and athletic (tumbling) association that dated back to 1866, and was a main organization from which the German immigrants drew mutual support. In the late 19th century the Turners merged with the Germania Gesang Verein, which hosted a Maennerchor and a Damenchor. Another merger enlarged the Germania in the late 1920s. The Germania merged with the Kicker&#x27;s Soccer Club, which for many years was a very active part of the organization. The club also now includes a Fahrrad Verein (Bicycle Club), which goes on weekend outings to bike trails throughout Central Ohio. The club&#x27;s official name is now the Germania Gesang und Sport Verein (singing and sports club). The Germania Club itself was located in a residence on Kossuth Street, but outgrew its first facility. In 1927 it purchased the present location at 543 South Front Street from the estate of Nicolaus Schlee, one of the prestigious brewmasters of the neighborhood.

The society is now located in the neighborhood known as the Brewery District of Columbus, which is the northernmost section of the German Village. Over the years the Germania Club has made it its mission to retain, promote and disseminate all that is good about German culture. A major component of this mission is the practice and performance of German song. Their choruses participate and support public events throughout Ohio during the year in appreciation for the community&#x27;s support. The Germania Club celebrated its 147th anniversary in 2013 with an Oktoberfes.

In 1890, the Ohio State Buckeyes football team played their first-ever home game in the south end, at a location just west of present-day Schiller Park between Jaeger, Ebner, and Whittier (then called Schiller) Streets.

<doc id="659894" wikidata="Q1746546" url="?curid=659894" title="Tricks (2007 film)">
<text>Tricks, () is a 2007 Polish film written, directed and produced by Andrzej Jakimowski starring Damian Ul, Ewelina Walendziak and Tomasz Sapryk. &quot;Tricks&quot; is Andrzej Jakimowski&#x27;s follow up to &quot;Squint Your Eyes&quot; (), his 2002 debut.

==Plot==
A charming bittersweet narrative unfolds from director Andrzej Jakimowski. This is the story of siblings Stefek, 6, and Elka, 18, along with Elka&#x27;s car mechanic boyfriend Jerzy during one sun-drenched summer. The siblings live with their mother who is a shopkeeper. Their father has left their mother for another woman, unaware of Stefek&#x27;s existence. After a chance encounter at the local railway station, and despite a denial by his sister that this was his father, Stefek decides to challenge fate to engineer another meeting. He believes that the chain of events he sets in motion will help him get closer to his father who abandoned his mother. His sister Elka teaches him how to bribe fate with small sacrifices. Tricks played, coupled with a number of coincidences eventually bring the father to the mother&#x27;s shop but the long-awaited reunion does not immediately materialise as expected. As a last chance, Stefak tries his good luck with the riskiest of his tricks.

<doc id="659899" wikidata="Q192414" url="?curid=659899" title="Gravimetric analysis">
<text>Gravimetric analysis describes a set of methods used in analytical chemistry for the quantitative determination of an analyte (the ion being analyzed) based on its mass. The principle of this type of analysis is that once an ion&#x27;s mass has been determined as a unique compound, that known measurement can then be used to determine the same analyte&#x27;s mass in a mixture, as long as the relative quantities of the other constituents are known.

The four main types of this method of analysis are &quot;precipitation&quot;, &quot;volatilization&quot;, &quot;electro-analytical&quot; and &quot;miscellaneous physical method&quot;. The methods involve changing the phase of the analyte to separate it in its pure form from the original mixture and are quantitative measurements.

==Precipitation method==

The precipitation method is the one used for the determination of the amount of calcium in water. Using this method, an excess of oxalic acid, H2C2O4, is added to a measured, known volume of water. By adding a reagent, here ammonium oxalate, the calcium will precipitate as calcium oxalate. The proper reagent, when added to aqueous solution, will produce highly insoluble precipitates from the positive and negative ions that would otherwise be soluble with their counterparts (equation 1).

The reaction is:

Formation of calcium oxalate:

Ca2+ + C2O42- → CaC2O4

The precipitate is collected, dried and ignited to high (red) heat which converts it entirely to calcium oxide.

The reaction is pure calcium oxide formed

CaC2O4 → CaO + CO+ CO2

The pure precipitate is cooled, then measured by weighing, and the difference in weights before and after reveals the mass of analyte lost, in this case calcium oxide. That number can then be used to calculate the amount, or the percent concentration, of it in the original mix.

==Volatilization methods==

Volatilization methods can be either &quot;direct&quot; or &quot;indirect&quot;. Water eliminated in a quantitative manner from many inorganic substances by ignition is an example of a direct determination. It is collected on a solid desiccant and its mass determined by the gain in mass of the desiccant.

Another direct volatilization method involves carbonates which generally decompose to release carbon dioxide when acids are used. Because carbon dioxide is easily evolved when heat is applied, its mass is directly established by the measured increase in the mass of the absorbent solid used.

Determination of the amount of water by measuring the loss in mass of the sample during heating is an example of an indirect method. It is well known that changes in mass occur due to decomposition of many substances when heat is applied, regardless of the presence or absence of water. Because one must make the assumption that water was the only component lost, this method is less satisfactory than direct methods.

This often faulty and misleading assumption has proven to be wrong on more than a few occasions. There are many substances other than water loss that can lead to loss of mass with the addition of heat, as well as a number of other factors that may contribute to it. The widened margin of error created by this all-too-often false assumption is not one to be lightly disregarded as the consequences could be far-reaching.

Nevertheless, the indirect method, although less reliable than direct, is still widely used in commerce. For example, it&#x27;s used to measure the moisture content of cereals, where a number of imprecise and inaccurate instruments are available for this purpose.

=== Types of volatilization methods ===
In volatilization methods, removal of the analyte involves separation by heating or chemically decomposing a volatile sample at a suitable temperature. In other words, thermal or chemical energy is used to precipitate a volatile species. For example, the water content of a compound can be determined by vaporizing the water using thermal energy (heat). Heat can also be used, if oxygen is present, for combustion to isolate the suspect species and obtain the desired results.

The two most common gravimetric methods using volatilization are those for water and carbon dioxide. An example of this method is the isolation of sodium hydrogen bicarbonate (the main ingredient in most antacid tablets) from a mixture of carbonate and bicarbonate. The total amount of this analyte, in whatever form, is obtained by addition of an excess of dilute sulfuric acid to the analyte in solution.

In this reaction, nitrogen gas is introduced through a tube into the flask which contains the solution. As it passes through, it gently bubbles. The gas then exits, first passing a drying agent (here CaSO4, the common desiccant &quot;Drierite&quot;). It then passes a mixture of the drying agent &quot;and&quot; sodium hydroxide which lies on asbestos or &quot;Ascarite II&quot;, a non-fibrous silicate containing sodium hydroxide. The mass of the carbon dioxide is obtained by measuring the increase in mass of this absorbent. This is performed by measuring the difference in weight of the tube in which the ascarite contained before and after the procedure.

The calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in the tube retains carbon dioxide selectively as it&#x27;s heated, and thereby, removed from the solution. The drying agent absorbs any aerosolized water and/or water vapor (reaction 3.). The mix of the drying agent and NaOH absorbs the CO2 and any water that may have been produced as a result of the absorption of the NaOH (reaction 4.).

The reactions are:

Reaction 3 - absorption of water

NaHCO3 + H2SO4 → CO2) + H2O + NaHSO4

Reaction 4. Absorption of CO2 and residual water

CO2 + 2 NaOH Na2CO3 + H2O

==Example==

A chunk of ore is to be analyzed for sulfur content. It is treated with concentrated nitric acid and potassium chlorate to convert all of the sulfur to sulfate (SO). The nitrate and chlorate are removed by treating the solution with concentrated HCl. The sulfate is precipitated with barium (Ba2+) and weighed as BaSO4.

==Advantages==

Gravimetric analysis, if methods are followed carefully, provides for exceedingly precise analysis. In fact, gravimetric analysis was used to determine the atomic masses of many elements in the periodic table to six figure accuracy. Gravimetry provides very little room for instrumental error and does not require a series of standards for calculation of an unknown. Also, methods often do not require expensive equipment. Gravimetric analysis, due to its high degree of accuracy, when performed correctly, can also be used to calibrate other instruments in lieu of reference standards. Gravimetric analysis is currently used to allow undergraduate chemistry/Biochemistry students to experience a grad level laboratory and it is a highly effective teaching tool to those who want to attend medical school or any research graduate school.

==Disadvantages==

Gravimetric analysis usually only provides for the analysis of a single element, or a limited group of elements, at a time. Comparing modern dynamic flash combustion coupled with gas chromatography with traditional combustion analysis will show that the former is both faster and allows for simultaneous determination of multiple elements while traditional determination allowed only for the determination of carbon and hydrogen. Methods are often convoluted and a slight mis-step in a procedure can often mean disaster for the analysis (colloid formation in precipitation gravimetry, for example). Compare this with hardy methods such as spectrophotometry and one will find that analysis by these methods is much more efficient.

==Solubility in the presence of diverse ions==

Diverse ions have a screening effect on dissociated ions which leads to extra dissociation. Solubility will show a clear increase in presence of diverse ions as the solubility product will increase. Look at the following example:

Find the solubility of AgCl (Ksp = 1.0 x 10−10) in 0.1 M NaNO3. The activity coefficients for silver and chloride are 0.75 and 0.76, respectively.

:AgCl(s) = Ag+ + Cl−
We can no longer use the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (i.e. in absence of diverse ions) and we have to consider the concentration equilibrium constant or use activities instead of concentration if we use Kth:

:Ksp = aAg+ aCl−
:Ksp = [Ag+] fAg+ [Cl−] fCl−
:1.0 x 10−10 = s x 0.75 x s x 0.76
:s = 1.3 x 10−5 M
We have calculated the solubility of AgCl in pure water to be 1.0 x 10−5 M, if we compare this value to that obtained in presence of diverse ions we see % increase in solubility = {(1.3 x 10−5 – 1.0 x 10−5) / 1.0 x 10−5} x 100 = 30%
Therefore, once again we have an evidence for an increase in dissociation or a shift of equilibrium to right in presence of diverse ions.

<text>An acid–base titration is a method of quantitative analysis for determining the concentration of Brønsted-Lowry acid or base (titrate) by neutralizing it using a solution of known concentration (titrant). A pH indicator is used to monitor the progress of the acid–base reaction and a titration curve can be constructed.

This differs from other modern modes of titrations, such as oxidation-reduction titrations, precipitation titrations, &amp; complexometric titrations. Although these types of titrations are also used to determine unknown amounts of substances, these substances vary from ions to metals.

Acid–base titration finds extensive applications in various scientific fields, such as pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, and quality control in industries. This method&#x27;s precision and simplicity makes it an important tool in quantitative chemical analysis, contributing significantly to the general understanding of solution chemistry.

== History ==
The history of acid-base titration dates back to the late 19th century when advancements in analytical chemistry fostered the development of systematic techniques for quantitative analysis. The origins of titration methods can be linked to the work of chemists such as Karl Friedrich Mohr in the mid-1800s. His contributions laid the groundwork for understanding titrations involving acids and bases.

Theoretical progress came with the research of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, who in the late 19th century, introduced the Arrhenius theory, providing a theoretical framework for acid-base reactions. This theoretical foundation, along with ongoing experimental refinements, contributed to the evolution of acid-base titration as a precise and widely applicable analytical method.

Over time, the method has undergone further refinements and adaptations, establishing itself as an essential tool in laboratories across various scientific disciplines.

==Alkalimetry and acidimetry==
Alkalimetry and acidimetry are types of volumetric analyses in which the fundamental reaction is a neutralization reaction. They involve the controlled addition of either an acid or a base (titrant) of known concentration to the solution of the unknown concentration (titrate) until the reaction reaches its stoichiometric equivalence point. At this point, the moles of acid and base are equal, resulting in a neutral solution: 

:acid + base → salt + water

For example:

:HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O

Acidimetry is the specialized analytical use of acid-base titration to determine the concentration of a basic (alkaline) substance using standard acid. This can be used for weak bases and strong bases. An example of an acidimetric titration involving a strong base is as follows:

:Ba(OH)2 + 2 H+ → Ba2+ + 2 H2O

In this case, the strong base (Ba(OH)2) is neutralized by the acid until all of the base has reacted. This allows the viewer to calculate the concentration of the base from the volume of the standard acid that is used.

Alkalimetry follows uses same concept of specialized analytic acid-base titration, but to determine the concentration of an acidic substance using standard base. An example of an alkalimetric titration involving a strong acid is as follows:

:H2SO4 + 2 OH− → SO42- + 2 H2O

In this case, the strong acid (H2SO4) is neutralized by the base until all of the acid has reacted. This allows the viewer to calculate the concentration of the acid from the volume of the standard base that is used.

The standard solution (titrant) is stored in the burette, while the solution of unknown concentration (analyte/titrate) is placed in the Erlenmeyer flask below it with an indicator.

==Indicator choice==
A suitable pH indicator must be chosen in order to detect the end point of the titration. The colour change or other effect should occur close to the equivalence point of the reaction so that the experimenter can accurately determine when that point is reached. The pH of the equivalence point can be estimated using the following rules:
* A strong acid will react with a strong base to form a neutral (pH = 7) solution.
* A strong acid will react with a weak base to form an acidic (pH &lt; 7) solution.
* A weak acid will react with a strong base to form a basic (pH &gt; 7) solution.
These indicators are essential tools in chemistry and biology, aiding in the determination of a solution&#x27;s acidity or alkalinity through the observation of colour transitions. The table below serves as a reference guide for these indicator choices, offering insights into the pH ranges and colour transformations associated with specific indicators:


Phenolphthalein is widely recognized as one of the most commonly used acid-base indicators in chemistry. Its popularity is because of its effectiveness in a broad pH range and its distinct colour transitions. Its sharp and easily detectable colour changes makes phenolphthalein a valuable tool for determining the endpoint of acid-base titrations, as a precise pH change signifies the completion of the reaction.

When a weak acid reacts with a weak base, the equivalence point solution will be basic if the base is stronger and acidic if the acid is stronger. If both are of equal strength, then the equivalence pH will be neutral. However, weak acids are not often titrated against weak bases because the colour change shown with the indicator is often quick, and therefore very difficult for the observer to see the change of colour.

The point at which the indicator changes colour is called the &quot;endpoint&quot;. A suitable indicator should be chosen, preferably one that will experience a change in colour (an endpoint) close to the equivalence point of the reaction.

In addition to the wide variety of indicator solutions, pH papers, crafted from paper or plastic infused with combinations of these indicators, serve as a practical alternative. The pH of a solution can be estimated by immersing a strip of pH paper into it and matching the observed colour to the reference standards provided on the container.

== Overshot titration ==
Overshot titrations are a common phenomenon, and refer to a situation where the volume of titrant added during a chemical titration exceeds the amount required to reach the equivalence point. This excess titrant leads to an outcome where the solution becomes slightly more alkaline or over-acidified.

Overshooting the equivalence point can occur due to various factors, such as errors in burette readings, imperfect reaction stoichiometry, or issues with endpoint detection. The consequences of overshot titrations can affect the accuracy of the analytical results, particularly in quantitative analysis.

Researchers and analysts often employ corrective measures, such as back-titration and using more precise titration techniques, to mitigate the impact of overshooting and obtain reliable and precise measurements. Understanding the causes, consequences, and solutions related to overshot titrations is crucial in achieving accurate and reproducible results in the field of chemistry.

== Mathematical analysis: titration of weak acid ==
For calculating concentrations, an ICE table can be used. ICE stands for &quot;initial&quot;, &quot;change&quot;, and &quot;equilibrium&quot;.

The pH of a weak acid solution being titrated with a strong base solution can be found at different points along the way. These points fall into one of four categories:
# initial pH
# pH before the equivalence point
# pH at the equivalence point
# pH after the equivalence point
1. The initial pH is approximated for a weak acid solution in water using the equation:

formula_1 where &lt;chem&gt;[H3O+]0&lt;/chem&gt; is the initial concentration of the hydronium ion.

2. The pH before the equivalence point depends on the amount of weak acid remaining and the amount of conjugate base formed. The pH can be calculated approximately by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:formula_2 where Ka is the acid dissociation constant.

3. The pH at the equivalence point depends on how much the weak acid is consumed to be converted into its conjugate base. Note that when an acid neutralizes a base, the pH may or may not be neutral (pH = 7). The pH depends on the strengths of the acid and base. In the case of a weak acid and strong base titration, the pH is greater than 7 at the equivalence point. Thus pH can be calculated using the following formula:

formula_3 Where &lt;chem&gt;{[OH^{-}]}&lt;/chem&gt; is the concentration of the hydroxide ion. The concentration of the hydroxide ion is calculated from the concentration of the hydronium ion and using the following relationship:

formula_4 Where Kb is the base dissociation constant, Kw is the water dissociation constant.

4. The pH after the equivalence point depends on the concentration of the conjugate base of the weak acid and the strong base of the titrant. However, the base of the titrant is stronger than the conjugate base of the acid. Therefore, the pH in this region is controlled by the strong base. As such the pH can be found using the following:

formula_5 where formula_6 is the concentration of the strong base that is added, formula_7 is the volume of base added until the equilibrium, formula_8 is the concentration of the strong acid that is added, and formula_9 is the initial volume of the acid.

=== Single formula ===
More accurately, a single formula that describes the titration of a weak acid with a strong base from start to finish is given below:

: formula_10
where
&quot; φ = fraction of completion of the titration (φ &lt; 1 is before the equivalence point, φ = 1 is the equivalence point, and φ &gt; 1 is after the equivalence point)

formula_11 = the concentrations of the acid and base respectively
: formula_12 = the volumes of the acid and base respectively

==Graphical methods==
Identifying the pH associated with any stage in the titration process is relatively simple for monoprotic acids and bases. A monoprotic acid is an acid that donates one proton. A monoprotic base is a base that accepts one proton. A monoprotic acid or base only has one equivalence point on a titration curve.

A diprotic acid donates two protons and a diprotic base accepts two protons. The titration curve for a diprotic solution has two equivalence points.

A polyprotic substance has multiple equivalence points.

All titration reactions contain small buffer regions that appear horizontal on the graph. These regions contain comparable concentrations of acid and base, preventing sudden changes in pH when additional acid or base is added.

== Pharmaceutical applications ==
In the pharmaceutical industry, acid-base titration serves as a fundamental analytical technique with diverse applications. One primary use involves the determination of the concentration of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) in drug formulations, ensuring product quality and compliance with regulatory standards.

Acid–base titration is particularly valuable in quantifying acidic or basic functional groups with pharmaceutical compounds. Additionally, the method is employed for the analysis of additives or ingredients, making it easier to adjust and control how a product is made. Quality control laboratories utilize acid-base titration to assess the purity of raw materials and to monitor various stages of drug manufacturing processes.

The technique&#x27;s reliability and simplicity make it an integral tool in pharmaceutical research and development, contributing to the production of safe and effective medications.

== Environmental monitoring applications ==
Acid–base titration plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring by providing a quantitative analytical method for assessing the acidity or alkalinity of water samples. The measurement of parameters such as pH, total alkalinity, and acidity is essential in evaluating the environmental impact of industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, and other sources of water contamination.

Acid–base titration allows for the determination of the buffering capacity of natural water systems, aiding in the assessment of their ability to resist changes in pH. Monitoring pH levels is important for preserving aquatic ecosystems and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

Acid–base titration is also utilized in the analysis of acid rain effects on soil and water bodies, contributing to the overall understanding and management of environmental quality. The method&#x27;s prevision and reliability make it a valuable tool in safeguarding ecosystems and assessing the impact of human activities on natural water resources.

<doc id="659907" wikidata="Q314394" url="?curid=659907" title="Jyotirao Phule">
<text>Jyotirao Phule (11 April 1827 – 28 November 1890), also known as Jyotiba Phule, was an Indian social activist, businessman, anti-caste social reformer and writer from Maharashtra. 

His work extended to many fields, including eradication of untouchability and the caste system and for his efforts in educating women and oppressed caste people. He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, were pioneers of women&#x27;s education in India. Phule started his first school for girls in 1848 in Pune at Tatyasaheb Bhide&#x27;s residence or Bhidewada. He, along with his followers, formed the Satyashodhak Samaj (Society of Truth Seekers) to attain equal rights for people from lower castes. People from all religions and castes could become a part of this association which worked for the upliftment of the oppressed classes. 

Phule is regarded as an important figure in the social reform movement in Maharashtra. The honorific Mahātmā (Sanskrit: &quot;great-souled&quot;, &quot;venerable&quot;), was first applied to him in 1888 at a special program honoring him in Mumbai.

==Early life==
Jyotirao Phule, also known as Jyotiba Phule, was born in Satara District in 1827 to a family that belonged to the Mali caste. The Malis traditionally worked as fruit and vegetable growers. In the four-fold &quot;varna&quot; system of caste hierarchy, they were placed within the Shudra category. Phule was named after the Hindu deity Jyotiba. He was born on the day of Jyotiba&#x27;s annual fair. Phule&#x27;s family, previously named &quot;Gorhe&quot;, had its origins in the village of Katgun, near the town of Satara. Phule&#x27;s great-grandfather, who had worked there as a , or low-ranking village official, moved to Khanwadi in Pune district. There, his only son, Shetiba, brought the family into poverty. The family, including three sons, moved to Poona seeking employment. The boys were taken under the wing of a florist who taught them the secrets of the trade. Their proficiency in growing and arranging became well known and they adopted the name &quot;Phule&quot; (flower-man) in place of &quot;Gorhe&quot;. Their fulfillment of commissions from the Peshwa, Baji Rao II, for flower mattresses and other goods for the rituals and ceremonies of the royal court so impressed him that he granted them of land on the basis of the &quot;Inam&quot; system, whereby no tax would be payable upon it. The oldest brother machinated to take sole control of the property, leaving the younger two siblings, Jyotirao Phule&#x27;s father, Govindrao, to continue farming and also flower-selling.

Govindrao married Chimnabai and had two sons, of whom Jyotirao was the youngest. Chimnabai died before he was aged one. The then backward Mali community did not give much significance to education and thus after attending primary school where he learnt the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, Jyotirao was withdrawn from school by his father. He joined the other members of his family at work, both in the shop and in the farm. However, a man from the same Mali caste as Phule&#x27;s recognised his intelligence and persuaded Phule&#x27;s father to allow him to attend the local &quot;Scottish Mission High School&quot;. Phule completed his English schooling in 1847. As was customary, he was married at the young age of 13, to a girl of his Mali community, chosen by his father.

The turning point in his life was in 1848, when he attended the wedding of a Brahmin friend. Phule participated in the customary marriage procession, but was later rebuked and insulted by his friend&#x27;s parents for doing so. They told him that he being from a Shudra caste should have had the sense to keep away from that ceremony. This incident profoundly affected him and shaped his understanding of the injustice inherent to the caste system.

==Social activism==
===Education===

In 1848, aged 21, Phule visited a girls&#x27; school in Ahmednagar run by Christian missionary Cynthia Farrar. It was also in 1848 that he read Thomas Paine&#x27;s book &quot;Rights of Man&quot; and developed a keen sense of social justice. He realized that exploited castes and women were at a disadvantage in Indian society, and also that education of these sections was vital to their emancipation. To this end and in the same year, Phule first taught reading and writing to his wife, Savitribai, and then the couple started the first indigenously run school for girls in Pune. He also taught his sister Sagunabai Kshirsagar (his maternal aunt&#x27;s daughter) to write Marathi with Savitribai. The conservative upper caste society of Pune didn&#x27;t approve of his work. But many Indians and Europeans helped him generously. Conservatives in Pune also forced his own family and community to ostracize them. During this period, their friend Usman Sheikh and his sister Fatima Sheikh provided them with shelter. They also helped to start the school on their premises. Later, the Phules started schools for children from the then untouchable castes such as Mahar and Mang. In 1852, there were three Phule schools in operation 273 girls were pursuing education in these school but by 1858 they had all closed. Eleanor Zelliot blames the closure on private European donations drying up due to the Rebellion of 1857, withdrawal of government support, and Jyotirao resigning from the school management committee because of disagreement regarding the curriculum.

===Women&#x27;s welfare===
Phule watched how untouchables were not permitted to pollute anyone with their shadows and that they had to attach a broom to their backs to wipe the path on which they had traveled. He saw how untouchable women had been forced to dance naked. He saw young widows shaving their heads, refraining from any sort of joy in their life. He made the decision to educate women by witnessing all these social evils that encouraged inequality. He began with his wife, every afternoon, Jyotirao sat with his wife Savitribai Phule and educated her when she went to the farms where he worked, to bring him his meal. He sent his wife to get trained at a school. The husband and wife set up India&#x27;s first girls&#x27; school in Vishrambag Wada, Pune, in 1848.

He championed widow remarriage and started a home for dominant caste pregnant widows to give birth in a safe and secure place in 1863. His orphanage was established in an attempt to reduce the rate of infanticide.

In 1863, Pune witnessed a horrific incident. A Brahmin widow named Kashibai got pregnant and her attempts at abortion didn&#x27;t succeed. She killed the baby after giving it birth and threw it in a well, but her act came to light. She had to face punishment and was sentenced to jail. This incident greatly upset Phule and hence, along with his longtime friend Sadashiv Ballal Govande and Savitribai, he started an infanticide prevention centre. Pamphlets were stuck around Pune advertising the centre in the following words: &quot;Widows, come here and deliver your baby safely and secretly. It is up to your discretion whether you want to keep the baby in the centre or take it with you. This orphanage will take care of the children [left behind].&quot; The Phule couple ran the infanticide prevention centre until the mid-1880s.

Phule tried to eliminate the stigma of social untouchability surrounding the exploited castes by opening his house and the use of his water well to the members of the exploited castes.

===Views on religion and caste===
Phule appealed for reestablishment of the reign of mythical Mahabali (King Bali) which predated &quot;Aryans&#x27; treacherous coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. He proposed his own version of Aryan invasion theory that the Aryan conquerors of India, whom the theory&#x27;s proponents considered to be racially superior, were in fact barbaric suppressors of the indigenous people. He believed that they had instituted the caste system as a framework for subjugation and social division that ensured the pre-eminence of their Brahmin successors. He saw the subsequent Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent as more of the same sort of thing, being a repressive alien regime, but took heart in the arrival of the British, whom he considered to be relatively enlightened and not supportive of the &quot;varnashramadharma&quot; system instigated and then perpetuated by those previous invaders. In his book, &quot;Gulamgiri&quot;, he thanked Christian missionaries and the British colonists for making the exploited castes realise that they are worthy of all human rights. The book, whose title transliterates as &quot;slavery&quot; and which concerned women, caste and reform, was dedicated to the people in the US who were working to end slavery.

Phule saw Vishnu&#x27;s avatars as a symbol of oppression stemming from the Aryan conquests and took Mahabali (Bali Raja) as hero. His critique of the caste system began with an attack on the Vedas, the most fundamental texts of Hindus. He considered them to be a form of false consciousness.

He is credited with introducing the Marathi word &quot;dalit&quot; (broken, crushed) as a descriptor for those people who were outside the traditional varna system.

At an education commission hearing in 1882, Phule called for help in providing education for lower castes. To implement it, he advocated making primary education compulsory in villages. He also asked for special incentives to get more lower-caste people in high schools and colleges.

===Satyashodhak Samaj===
On 24 September 1873, Phule formed Satyashodhak Samaj to focus on rights of depressed groups such women, the Shudra, and the Dalit. Through this samaj, he opposed idolatry and denounced the caste system. Satyashodhak Samaj campaigned for the spread of rational thinking and rejected the need for priests.

Phule established Satyashodhak Samaj with the ideals of human well-being, happiness, unity, equality, and easy religious principles and rituals. A Pune-based newspaper, &quot;Deenbandhu&quot;, provided the voice for the views of the Samaj.

The membership of the samaj included Muslims, Brahmins and government officials. Phule&#x27;s own Mali caste provided the leading members and financial supporters for the organization.

==Occupation==

Apart from his role as a social activist, Phule was a businessman too. In 1882 he styled himself as a merchant, cultivator and municipal contractor. He owned of farmland at Manjri, near Pune. For a period of time, he worked as a contractor for the government and supplied building materials required for the construction of a dam on the Mula-Mutha river near Pune in the 1870s. He also received contracts to provide labour for the construction of the Katraj Tunnel and the Yerawda Jail near Pune. One of Phule&#x27;s businesses, established in 1863, was to supply metal-casting equipment.

Phule was appointed commissioner (municipal council member) to the then Poona municipality in 1876 and served in this unelected position until 1883.

==Published works==
Phule&#x27;s &quot;akhandas&quot; were organically linked to the &quot;abhangs&quot; of Marathi Varkari saint Tukaram. Among his notable published works are:

*&quot;Tritiya Ratna&quot;, 1855
*&quot;Brahmananche Kasab&quot;, 1869

*&quot;Asprushyanchi Kaifiyat&quot;

==Legacy==
According to Dhananjay Keer, Phule was bestowed with the title of &quot;Mahatma&quot; on 11 May 1888 by another social reformer from Bombay, Vithalrao Krishnaji Vandekar.

Indian Postal Department issued a postage stamp in year 1977 in the honour of Phule.

An early biography of Phule was the Marathi-language &quot;Mahatma Jotirao Phule Yanche Charitra&quot; (P. S. Patil, Chikali: 1927). Two others are &quot;Mahatma Phule. Caritra Va Kriya&quot; (&quot;Mahatma Phule. Life and Work&quot;) (A. K. Ghorpade, Poona: 1953), which is also in Marathi, and &quot;Mahatma Jyotibha Phule: Father of Our Social Revolution&quot; (Dhananjay Keer, Bombay: 1974). Unpublished material relating to him is held by the Bombay State Committee on the History of the Freedom Movement.

Phule&#x27;s work inspired B. R. Ambedkar, the first minister of law of India and the chief of Indian constitution&#x27;s drafting committee. Ambedkar had acknowledged Phule as one of his three gurus or masters.

There are many structures and places commemorating Phule. These include:
* The full-length statue inaugurated at the premises of Vidhan Bhavan (Assembly Building of Maharashtra State)
* Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai, formerly known as Crawford Market, in Mumbai
* Mahatma Phule Museum in Pune
* Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth (Agricultural University) in Rahuri, Ahmednagar District, Maharashtra
* Mahathma Phule Mandai, the biggest vegetable market in Pune
* Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University
* Subharti College of Physiotherapy was formerly named after him.

<text>In Chinese philosophy, metal or gold () in wuxing, is the return or the declining stage. It is associated with the west, dusk, autumn, loss, grief, and the White Tiger. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Metal is yang within yin in character, its motion is going inwards and its energy is contracting. It is also related to lungs, the large intestine, noses, and skin. The archetypal metals are silver or gold.

== Attributes ==

In Chinese Taoism and traditional Chinese medical theory and thought, some attributes of Metal are firmness, rigidity, focus, integrity, and quality. The metal person when excessive is controlling, cutoff and arrogant, set in their ways as metal can become very rigid. They are self-reliant and resilient and prefer to handle their problems alone. The metal person is also intelligent, business-oriented, and good at organization and stability. However, the metal person can also appreciate luxury and enjoy the good things in life. The metal person has strong impulses and generative powers that they can use to change and transform those who come into contact with them, just like metal can conduct electricity. The well-balanced metal person is calm, humble and honest as well as a good person with a focused mind. 

== Astrology ==
In Chinese astrology, metal is included in the 10 heavenly stems (the five elements in their yin and yang forms), which combine with the 12 Earthly Branches (or Chinese signs of the zodiac), to form the 60-year cycle. Yang metal years end in 0 (e.g. 1980), while Yin years end in 1 (e.g. 1981). Metal governs the Chinese zodiac signs Monkey
and Rooster. The planet Venus is associated with metal because it is white in color (the Chinese color of death), and rises in the west as the evening star.

== Cycle of Wu Xing ==

In the regenerative cycle of the Wu Xing, earth engenders Metal as &quot;all metal has to be extracted from the earth in which it resides&quot;; Metal begets water as from the mountain tops flowed the water from the source.

In the conquest cycle, fire overcomes metal as love melts the coldest heart or &quot;can only be melted and forged&quot; by flame or heat; Metal adds minerals to wood for it to grow healthy and straight or overcomes wood as the metal axe is able to topple the tallest tree.

However, the Cycle of Wu Xing also states that excessive volumes of wood may defeat small volumes of metal, Wood by excessively wanting to grow undermines its integrity and becomes a weed and not a tree or as an axe would be broken or dulled after trying to chop down a forest.

<text>The  (, &quot;Flemish National Union&quot; or &quot;Flemish National League&quot;), widely known by its acronym VNV, was a Flemish nationalist political party active in Belgium between 1933 and 1945. It became the leading force of political collaboration in Flanders during the German occupation of Belgium in World War II. Authoritarian by inclination, the party advocated the creation of a &quot;Greater Netherlands&quot; (&quot;Dietsland&quot;) combining Flanders and the Netherlands.

==Origins==
The (VNV) was founded on 8 October 1933. Its origins were in the long-established Frontpartij, a moderate Flemish patriotic party which was taken over by Staf Declercq and moved to the right in 1932. From the start, the VNV was authoritarian and anti-democratic, being influenced by fascist ideas from elsewhere in Europe. However, it initially included both moderate and radical wings. It was not a genuinely fascist organisation &quot;per se&quot;. Ideologically, the party rejected Belgium and supported the creation of a new polity known as the Greater Netherlands (&quot;Dietsland&quot;), through the fusion of Belgian Flanders and the Netherlands, which would be linguistically and ethnically homogeneous. The party&#x27;s slogan was: &quot;Authority, discipline, &quot;Dietsland&quot;&quot;.

It shared many ideological elements with Verdinaso, a rival party founded two years earlier but slightly less radical. Unlike Verdinaso, the VNV took part in elections and included a relatively moderate wing. Initially, it also differed from Verdinaso in not being an anti-Semitic movement. Still, it increasingly embraced anti-Semitic elements after 1935, out of political calculation rather than ideological conviction.

In the 1936 Belgian general election, the VNV received 13.6% of the Flemish vote, corresponding to 7.1% nationwide. After the election, in which the far-right nationalist and Catholic Rexist Party also performed strongly, the two parties concluded an alliance intended to create a corporatist Belgian state with great autonomy for Flanders. The VNV revoked this agreement after just one year. In the 1939 elections, the VNV moderately increased its share of the Flemish vote to 15% (8.4% nationally) while the Rexist vote collapsed.

Despite cooperating with the Flemish section of the mainstream centre-right Catholic Party on the local level, De Clercq realised that his movement would not be able to take power by democratic means. Instead, he contacted Nazi Germany, hoping his project could be realised with German help. He contacted the Abwehr, Germany&#x27;s military intelligence service, informing them that a part of the Belgian military supported his movement and could be controlled by him if Germany declared war. The Belgian state security gained knowledge of these contacts and arrested some VNV supporters.

==Collaboration==

When Nazi Germany invaded Belgium in 1940, De Clercq immediately chose to orient the VNV towards collaborationism, despite his previous declarations that he would not do so. Adolf Hitler did not install a civilian government (as in the Netherlands), but instead installed a military administration headed by General Alexander von Falkenhausen of the Wehrmacht. This, along with the departure of Ward Hermans and René Lagrou to form the Algemeene-SS Vlaanderen, led the VNV out of focus, forcing it to intensify its collaboration to gain influence. Hitler and SS leader Heinrich Himmler profited from the situation and increased competition between various groups by founding some more extreme collaborationist groups like the 6th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Langemarck and DeVlag (&quot;German-Flemish Working Group&quot;). Nevertheless, VNV politicians were given the mayor&#x27;s office in several Flemish towns. VNV-led local administrations participated in the organisation of the deportation of Belgian Jews to Eastern Europe as part of the Holocaust in Belgium. They willingly implemented Nazi policies like the obligation of Jews to wear the yellow badge. VNV activists led in the Antwerp pogrom of April 1941.

Declercq died suddenly in October 1942 and was succeeded by Hendrik Elias, a member of the more moderate side. Elias continued collaborating with the Nazis but tried to come to terms with the military government to prevent the installation of a civilian government composed of Nazis. Elias failed, as Hitler installed the new body and declared the annexation of Flanders by Germany in 1944; seven weeks later, Belgium was liberated by the Allies. The VNV was outlawed after the liberation of Belgium. Elias fled to Germany but was tried after the war and imprisoned until 1959.

<text>Bolsa Chica State Beach is a public ocean beach in Orange County, California, United States. It is surrounded entirely by the city of Huntington Beach to the north and east, and to the northwest by the Huntington Beach community of Sunset Beach and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The beach extends from Warner Avenue in Sunset Beach south to Seapoint Avenue, where the Huntington City Beach begins. The Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve is located across the busy Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) from the beach and is a popular spot for birdwatching. The Bolsa Chica Bicycle Path runs along the length of the park through Huntington City Beach.

Activities include surfing, sunbathing, water sports and fishing. Tent camping is not allowed at Bolsa Chica State Beach. Fire rings are available. 

Surf fishing for perch, corbina, California corbina, croaker, cabezon, shovelnose guitar fish and sand shark is available. California grunion is a species that only spawns on sandy southern California beaches. Under state law, these fish may be caught by hand with a fishing permit. Wildlife and bird watching are also popular at this state beach. 

Lifeguards from the California State Parks Lifeguard Service patrol the beach year-round and lifeguard towers are staffed during the summer.

==History==
The area that is now Bolsa Chica State Beach was once called &quot;Tin Can Beach&quot; by locals. The property was added to the state park system in 1960.

In 1967, a nuclear power and desalination plant was planned on Bolsa Island, a man-made island off the beach. It was supposed to produce more electricity than the Hoover Dam. However, the plans were abandoned by its chairman Jack K. Horton in 1968, as Southern California Edison was unable to raise sufficient capital, despite rate hikes and the sale of common stocks.

<text>Border Field State Park is a state park of California, United States, containing beach and coastal habitat on the Mexico–United States border. The park is within the city limits of Imperial Beach in San Diego County, next to the suburb of Playas de Tijuana in Mexico. It contains the southernmost point in the state of California. The refuge forms the southern part of Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve.

Border Field State Park contains Friendship Park, which is just inland from the place where the border meets the ocean. Immediately adjacent is the Initial Point of Boundary Between U.S. and Mexico.

==History==
The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was concluded on February 2, 1848, officially ending the war between the United States and Mexico. It provided that the new international border between the two countries be established by a joint United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. The commission began its survey at Border Field. During World War II it was base for Border Naval Outlying Landing Field

The park was closed to the public in 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak. After the COVID-19 threat passed, the park remained closed, ostensibly due to flooding and sewage issues. In 2024 the park remained closed, purportedly due to construction on new border fence. The park remains closed as of January 2025.

==Habitat==
The Tijuana River National Estuarine Research Reserve contains much of Border Field State Park and is an important wildlife habitat. The salt and freshwater marshes give refuge to migrating waterfowl and resident wading birds, such as black-necked stilt, American avocet, green-winged teal, American wigeon and pelicans. The park offers hiking, horse trails, surf fishing and birding.

==Visitors==
For fiscal year 2014–2015 61,799 people visited the Border Field State Park, up from 45,633 in FY 2011–2012.

<doc id="659932" wikidata="Q1147121" url="?curid=659932" title="The Devil's Dictionary">
<text>The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary is a satirical dictionary written by American journalist Ambrose Bierce, consisting of common words followed by humorous and satirical definitions. The lexicon was written over three decades as a series of installments for magazines and newspapers. Bierce&#x27;s witty definitions were imitated and plagiarized for years before he gathered them into books, first as The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book in 1906 and then in a more complete version as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in 1911.

Initial reception of the book versions was mixed. In the decades following, however, the stature of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; grew. It has been widely quoted, frequently translated, and often imitated, earning a global reputation. In the 1970s, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; was named as one of &quot;The 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature&quot; by the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration. It has been called &quot;howlingly funny&quot;, and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; columnist Jason Zweig said in an interview that &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; is &quot;probably the most brilliant work of satire written in America. And maybe one of the greatest in all of world literature.&quot;

==History==

===Predecessors===

Prior to Bierce, the best-known writer of amusing definitions was Samuel Johnson. His &quot;A Dictionary of the English Language&quot; was published 15 April 1755. Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary&quot; defined 42,733 words, almost all seriously. A small handful have witty definitions and became widely quoted, but they were infrequent exceptions to Johnson&#x27;s learned and serious explanations of word meanings.

Noah Webster earned fame for his 1806 &quot;A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language&quot; and his 1828 &quot;An American Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. Most people assume that Webster&#x27;s text is unrelieved by humor, but (as Bierce himself was to discover and describe), Webster made witty comments in a tiny number of definitions.

Gustave Flaubert wrote notes for the &quot;Dictionary of Received Ideas&quot; (sometimes called &quot;Dictionary of Accepted Ideas&quot;; in French, &quot;Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues&quot;) between 1850 and 1855 but never completed it. Decades after his death, researchers combed through Flaubert&#x27;s papers and published the &quot;Dictionary&quot; under his name in 1913 (two years after Bierce&#x27;s book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;), &quot;But the alphabetful of definitions we have here is compiled from a mass of notes, duplicates and variants that were never even sorted, much less proportioned and polished by the author.&quot;

===Origins and development===
Bierce took decades to write his lexicon of satirical definitions. He warmed up by including definitions infrequently in satirical essays, most often in his weekly columns &quot;The Town Crier&quot; or &quot;Prattle&quot;. His earliest known definition was published in 1867.

His first try at a multiple-definition essay was titled &quot;Webster Revised&quot;. It included definitions of four terms and was published in early 1869. Bierce also wrote definitions in his personal letters. For example, in one letter he defined &quot;missionaries&quot; as those &quot;who, in their zeal to lay about them, do not scruple to seize any weapon that they can lay their hands on; they would grab a crucifix to beat a dog.&quot;
By summer of 1869 he had conceived of the idea of something more substantial: &quot;Could any one but an American humorist ever have conceived the idea of a &quot;Comic Dictionary&quot;&quot; he wrote.

Bierce did not make his first start at writing a satirical glossary until six years later. He called it &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, and it appeared in the &quot;San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser&quot; of 11 December 1875. His glossary provided 48 short witty definitions, from &quot;A&quot; (&quot;The first letter in every properly constructed alphabet&quot;) through &quot;accoucheur&quot;. But &quot;The Demon&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; appeared only once, and Bierce wrote no more satirical lexicons for another six years.

Even so, Bierce&#x27;s short glossary spawned imitators. One of the most substantial was written by Harry Ellington Brook, the editor of a humor magazine called &quot;The Illustrated San Francisco Wasp&quot;. Brook&#x27;s continuing column of serialized satirical definitions was called &quot;Wasp&#x27;s Improved Webster in Ten-Cent Doses&quot;. The column started with the 7 August 1880 issue and appeared weekly in 28 issues, working its way step-by-step alphabetically to define 758 words, ending with &quot;shoddy&quot; in the 26 February 1881 issue.

In the next issue of &quot;The Wasp&quot; Brook&#x27;s column appeared no more, because &quot;The Wasp&quot; hired Bierce and he stopped it, replacing &quot;Wasp&#x27;s Improved Webster&quot; with his own column of satirical definitions. Bierce named his column “The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary.” It first appeared in the March 5, 1881 issue. Bierce wrote 79 “The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary” columns, working his way alphabetically to the word “lickspittle” in the 14 Aug. 1886 issue.

After Bierce left &quot;The Wasp&quot;, he was hired by William Randolph Hearst to write for his newspaper &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; in 1887. Bierce&#x27;s first &quot;Prattle&quot; column appeared in the &quot;Examiner&quot; on March 5 of that year, and the next installment of his satirical lexicon appeared in the 4 September 1887 issue on page 4, under the title &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Bierce wrote one more “The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary” column (which ran in the 29 April 1888 &quot;Examiner&quot;, page 4), and then no more appeared for sixteen years.

In the meantime, Bierce&#x27;s idea of a &quot;comic dictionary&quot; was imitated by others, and his witty definitions were plagiarized without crediting him. One imitator even copied the name of Bierce&#x27;s column.

In September 1903, Bierce wrote letters to his friend Herman George Scheffauer mentioning he was thinking about a book of his satirical definitions &quot;regularly arranged as in a real dictionary.&quot;

Bierce restarted his “The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary” columns with new definitions beginning in June 1904. Hearst&#x27;s newspaper publishing company had grown nationally, so Bierce&#x27;s readership had expanded dramatically as well. Now “The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary” columns usually appeared first in Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York American&quot;, next in other Hearst papers (&quot;San Francisco Examiner, Boston American, Chicago American, Los Angeles Examiner&quot;), and then via Hearst&#x27;s syndication business in other newspapers covering additional cities Hearst newspapers did not reach.

===Book publication===
On 4 November 1905, Bierce wrote to a friend that he was at last reshaping the witty definitions from his newspaper columns into a book, and was irritated by his imitators: “I&#x27;m compiling &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; at the suggestion of Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., who doubtless think it a lot of clowneries like the books to which it gave the cue.”

The 25 November 1905 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; contained “Some Definitions,” a short list of humorous definitions by &quot;Post&quot; editor Harry Arthur Thompson. Thompson&#x27;s definitions were popular enough to generate short sequel lists called “Frivolous Definitions” and to be reprinted in newspapers and magazines. Thompson and his definitions would have an unexpected impact on the publication of Bierce&#x27;s book.

On 19 March 1906 Bierce signed a contract with Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. for publication of his book, but without his preferred title &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Instead the contract used the same title as Bierce&#x27;s nationally distributed newspaper columns: &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Bierce explained to poet and playwright George Sterling: “They (the publishers) won&#x27;t have &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; [as a title]. Here in the East the Devil is a sacred personage (the Fourth Person of the Trinity, as an Irishman might say) and his name must not be taken in vain.”

Bierce&#x27;s publishers quickly discovered that they would not be able to use &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; for the title either. Harry Arthur Thompson was turning the handful of definitions he wrote for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; into a book. Thompson&#x27;s book would be published first and would steal Bierce&#x27;s title. Bierce wrote to Sterling: “I shall have to call it something else, for the publishers tell me there is a &quot;Cynic&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; already out. I dare say the author took more than my title—the stuff has been a rich mine for a plagiarist for many a year.”

The new title for Bierce&#x27;s book would be &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot;. Bierce changed the title of his newspaper columns to “The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book” to match his book.

Bierce&#x27;s book was filed for copyright 30 August 1906 and was published October 1906. &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; contained 521 definitions, but only for words beginning with “A” through “L.”

Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. printed and bound 1,341 copies of &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot;. 147 copies were given to the author and to book reviewers for newspapers and magazines; 1,070 copies were sold; and eventually Doubleday remaindered 124 unsold copies and sold them below the publisher&#x27;s cost. Doubleday was also able to sell British rights to a small publisher in London, Arthur F. Bird, who brought out a British edition in 1907. Sales of &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; qualified it from the publisher&#x27;s point of view as modestly successful, but not strong enough to justify a companion volume of words beginning with “M” through “Z” as Bierce had hoped.

Bierce&#x27;s plan to cover the entire alphabet was brought back to life by publisher Walter Neale, who persuaded Bierce to sign an agreement with him on 1 June 1908 for Neale to publish &quot;The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce&quot; in a set of ten or more volumes. They planned for Volume 7 to be Bierce&#x27;s lexicon, finally using his preferred title, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

To create a typescript for Neale to publish, Bierce first marked up a copy of &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; with changes and a few additions. That work quickly gave him definitions of words beginning with “A” through “L”. Next he took clippings of his newspaper column definitions and revised them. That brought his dictionary up from “L” to early in the letter “R”. Finally Bierce wrote 37 pages of mostly new definitions spanning from “RECONSIDER” to the end of “Z”. On 11 December 1908 Bierce wrote to George Sterling that he had completed work on &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

In 1909 publisher Walter Neale began issuing individual volumes in the 12-volume set &quot;The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce&quot;. Volume 7, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, was published in 1911. Unlike most publishers, who sell &quot;individual&quot; volumes of a published work, Neale focused on selling &quot;complete sets&quot; of the 12-volume &quot;Works&quot;. Neale later claimed that he printed and sold 1,250 sets (250 numbered fully leatherbound sets, the first volume of each set signed by Bierce; a small number of sets half-bound in Morocco leather; and the bulk as sets of clothbound hardcovers). However, Neale&#x27;s surviving royalty statements to Bierce for &quot;The Collected Works&quot; tell a different story: Bierce was paid for sales of 57 fully leatherbound 12-volume sets, 8 half-Morocco sets, and approximately 164 clothbound hardback sets.

Neale did not sell the rights to print a British edition of &quot;The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce&quot;. However, in late 1913 or early 1914 the periodical &quot;The London Opinion&quot; paid Neale for the right to reprint definitions of 787 words from &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

;&quot;Cynic&quot; : (n.) A whose faulty vision sees things as they are, not as they ought to be. Hence the custom among the Scythians of plucking out a cynic&#x27;s eyes to improve his vision.

:Youth is the true Saturnian Reign, the Golden Age on earth again, when figs are grown on thistles, and pigs betailed with whistles and, wearing silken bristles, live ever in clover, and cows fly over, delivering milk at every door, and Justice is never heard to snore, and every assassin is made a ghost and, howling, is cast into Baltimost! —Polydore Smith

Under the entry &quot;leonine&quot;, meaning a single line of poetry with an internal rhyming scheme, Bierce included an apocryphal couplet written by the fictitious &quot;Bella Peeler Silcox&quot; (i.e. Ella Wheeler Wilcox) in which an internal rhyme is achieved in both lines only by mispronouncing the rhyming words:

==Reception==

Initial critical reception for &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; was mixed. Some reviewers praised Bierce&#x27;s book, such as the anonymous critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot;, who wrote: “It is a dictionary of misdefinitions, funny, witty and with an abiding background of humor, a tinge of real philosophy yet never degenerating into cheapness. One, upon reading it, finds a decided delight upon Bierce&#x27;s character and his grim morbidness and obsession.”

Other reviewers disliked the sharp edge of Bierce&#x27;s wit. Some were exhausted trying to read &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; cover-to-cover, as though it was a thriller or popular novel. Edward F. Cahill of the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; concluded of Bierce&#x27;s definitions: “As paragraphs they were amusing, but in book form they grow tiresome.” Even so, Cahill could not help but quote a definition he found particularly amusing.

Like Cahill, other reviewers—whether they hated &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; or they loved it—quoted definitions they liked. When the British edition of &quot;The Cynic&#x27;s Word Book&quot; was published, one London magazine published a long, nearly full-page approving review; 95% of it was quoted definitions, and the review never mentioned the author Bierce&#x27;s name even once.

In 1911 &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; was published as volume 7 of the twelve-volume set of &quot;The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce&quot;. Most reviewers of the twelve-volume set didn&#x27;t mention &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in their reviews, and those few who even named the book gave it scant consideration. For example, in a 9¾-page magazine article on Bierce&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;, Frederic Taber Cooper gave &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; one paragraph, explaining “One is tempted to devote considerably more space than is warranted to that extremely clever collection of satiric definitions, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. It represents a deliberate pose consistently maintained, it is pervaded with a spirit of what a large proportion of readers in a Christian country would pronounce irreverent, it tells us nothing new and can hardly be conceived of as an inspiration for higher or nobler living. But it is undeniably entertaining reading.”

&quot;The Athenaeum Journal&quot;, one of the most widely circulated literary periodicals in the world, gave &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; lengthier consideration and observed: “Dealing with a wide range of topics as well as a great number of words, it presents a sort of summary index of the author’s characteristic views as well as his literary aptitudes and poses. . . . Substantial intellectual value belongs to a great many entries that deal with a few large groups of subjects (politics, philosophy, &amp;c.) that are individually too long for quotation.”

Seven years after the book&#x27;s publication H. L. Mencken, the most influential American literary critic during the first quarter of the twentieth century, praised &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; highly: “There you will find the most brilliant stuff, first and last, that America has ever produced. There you will find the true masterpiece of the one genuine wit that These States have ever seen.” Mencken later stated the book&#x27;s contents “… are some of the most gorgeous witticisms in the English language. … In &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; are some of the most devastating epigrams ever written.”

At that time, critical evaluations of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; were rare because copies of the book were hard to find. This scarcity changed in 1925, when the first reprint of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; was published, making the book easy to obtain. About the same time, the first abridged version was published by Haldeman-Julius as a Little Blue Book with a budget price of five cents. As &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; became widely available, critical coverage of it increased.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewed one reprinted edition: “It is a tour de force of no mean proportions, because it is possible to read it from cover to cover without being bored, so amusing are his unexpected turns of caustic humor, so brilliant his flagitious wit and so diverting the verses and dicta of non-existent philosophers as ‘Father Cassalasca Jape, S. J.’, with which he illustrates them.”

After receiving attention from reviewers in newspapers and commercial magazines, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; started to receive analyses from scholars in dissertations and academic journals. They investigated the place of Bierce&#x27;s writing in the world&#x27;s history of satire, how &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; achieved its humorous effects, and the themes Bierce stressed in the book. In an often-cited essay, French author Jacques Sternberg categorized the caustic wit of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as an example of &quot;humor noir&quot;.

Reprinted editions sometimes provided critical information about the book in the form of introductions by literary critics, Bierce scholars, or Bierce&#x27;s biographers. In addition, the many imitators and successors of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; occasionally included thoughtful comments on Bierce&#x27;s achievement.

Scholars came to agree that &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; is “of primary importance to any study, understanding, or appreciation of Ambrose Bierce.” Critics noted that the &quot;Dictionary&quot;″s definitions are frequently quoted, both with and without attribution, so several of Bierce&#x27;s observations have been absorbed into American culture, familiar to and repeated by people who have no idea where the witticisms originated. Critics also noticed that Bierce used his humorous dictionary as a vehicle for moral instruction, as “… he often induced the readers to reexamine the validity of their own thinking.” A critical consensus has evolved that considers &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; as “An American masterpiece of cynical wit” and &quot;… probably the most brilliant work of satire written in America. And maybe one of the greatest in all of world literature.&quot;

In 1973, the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration was created by an act of Congress to create events and commemorations to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The Bicentennial Administration decided to select “The 100 Greatest Masterpieces of American Literature,” one hundred books written by Americans that “actually helped to shape the very course of our nation.” Faculty members of universities in all fifty states submitted nominations. The final choices included 99 volumes of fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and plays, but only one volume of humor: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;.

Since then the critical reputation of &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; has continued to expand, as has the book&#x27;s popularity with readers, by means of reprints, illustrated versions, and abridged editions continuously published in a dozen languages around the world.

<doc id="659937" wikidata="Q30587598" url="?curid=659937" title="Faroese orthography">
<text>Faroese orthography is the method employed to write the Faroese language, using a 29-letter Latin alphabet, although it does not include the letters C, Q, W, X and Z.

==Alphabet==

The Faroese alphabet consists of 29 letters derived from the Latin script:


* Eth (Faroese &quot;) never appears at the beginning of a word, which means its majuscule form rarely occurs except in situations where all-capital letters are used, such as on maps.
* can also be written in poetic language, such as &quot;&quot; (&#x27;the Faroes&#x27;). This has to do with different orthographic traditions (Danish–Norwegian for and Icelandic for ). Originally, both forms were used, depending on the historical form of the word; was used when the vowel resulted from I-mutation of while was used when the vowel resulted from U-mutation of . In handwriting, is sometimes used.
* While , , , , and are not found in the Faroese language, was known in earlier versions of Hammershaimb&#x27;s orthography, such as for Saksun.
* While the Faroese keyboard layout allows one to write in Latin, English, Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, etc., the Old Norse and Modern Icelandic letter is missing. In related Faroese words, it is written as either or . If an Icelandic name has to be transcribed, is common.

==Spelling-to-sound correspondence==
This section lists Faroese letters and letter combinations and their phonemic representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

===Vowels===

Faroese vowels may be either long or short, but this distinction is only relevant in stressed syllables: the only unstressed vowels (at least in native words) are . The vowel length is determined by the number of consonants that follow the vowel: if there is only one consonant (i.e., CVCV or CVC# syllable structure), the vowel is long; if there are more than one (CVCCV), counting geminates and pre-aspirated stops as CC, the vowel is short. In addition to long monophthongs, Faroese also has diphthongs, which are always long. There are, however, some exceptions to the vowel length rule:

# A vowel is long if it precedes a consonant combination + . Examples include , , . The situation is however more complex, as seen below:
#* When the second consonant is , as in , , and , the combination is treated as one sound (see below), and thus the vowel is long. However, the vowel before is short.
#* is not considered to be a consonant cluster, so the vowel preceding it is short.
# In loanwords before , the vowel is optionally long.
# The genitive suffix does not affect the vowel length; e.g., , .

=== Consonants ===
==Glide insertion==
Faroese avoids having a hiatus between two vowels by inserting a glide. Orthographically, this is shown in three ways:
# vowel + + vowel
# vowel + + vowel
# vowel + vowel
Typically, the first vowel is long and in words with two syllables always stressed, while the second vowel is short and unstressed. In Faroese, short &quot;and&quot; unstressed vowels can only be .

The value of the glide is determined by the surrounding vowels:
#* &quot;I-surrounding, type 1&quot; – after : &#x27; (to wait), &#x27; (dead), &quot;&quot; (sheep)
#* &quot;I-surrounding, type 2&quot; – between any vowel (except &quot;u-vowels&quot; ) and : &#x27; (ballad), &#x27; (rage).
#* &quot;U-surrounding, type 1&quot; – after : &#x27; (Odin), &#x27; (good morning!), &#x27; (south), &#x27; (to make a trace).
#* &quot;U-surrounding, type 2&quot; – between and : &#x27; (before), &#x27; (leather), &#x27; (in clothes), &#x27; (in newspapers).
#* &quot;A-surrounding, type 2&quot;
#** These are exceptions (&quot;there is also a regular pronunciation&quot;): &quot; (eider-duck).
#** The past participles always have : &quot; (beloved, &quot;nom., acc. fem. pl.&quot;)
# &quot;Silent&quot;
#* &quot;A-surrounding, type 1&quot; – between and and in some words between and : &#x27; (to advise), &#x27; (to gladden, please), &#x27; (to forebode), &#x27; (to chant), &quot;&quot; (to make a speech)

<text>In geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four straight sides of equal length and four equal angles. Squares are special cases of rectangles, which have four equal angles, and of rhombuses, which have four equal sides. As with all rectangles, a square&#x27;s angles are right angles (90 degrees, or /2 radians), making adjacent sides perpendicular. The area of a square is the side length multiplied by itself, and so in algebra, multiplying a number by itself is called squaring.

Equal squares can tile the plane edge-to-edge in the square tiling. Square tilings are ubiquitous in tiled floors and walls, graph paper, image pixels, and game boards. Square shapes are also often seen in building floor plans, origami paper, food servings, in graphic design and heraldry, and in instant photos and fine art.

The formula for the area of a square forms the basis of the calculation of area and motivates the search for methods for squaring the circle by compass and straightedge, now known to be impossible. Squares can be inscribed in any smooth or convex curve such as a circle or triangle, but it remains unsolved whether a square can be inscribed in every simple closed curve. Several problems of squaring the square involve subdividing squares into unequal squares. Mathematicians have also studied packing squares as tightly as possible into other shapes.

Squares form the metric balls for taxicab geometry and Chebyshev distance, two forms of non-Euclidean geometry. Although spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry both lack polygons with four equal sides and right angles, they have square-like regular polygons with four sides and other angles, or with right angles and different numbers of sides.

==Definitions==

Squares can be defined in many equivalent ways. If a quadrilateral (a four-sided polygon in the Euclidean plane) satisfies any one of the following definitions, it satisfies all of them:
* A square is a rectangle with four equal sides.
* A square is a rhombus with a right angle between a pair of adjacent sides.
* A square is a rhombus with all angles equal.
* A square is a parallelogram with one right angle and two adjacent equal sides.
* A square is a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles; that is, it is a quadrilateral that is both a rhombus and a rectangle
* A square is a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal, and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other. That is, it is a rhombus with equal diagonals.
* A square is a quadrilateral with successive sides formula_1, formula_2, formula_3, formula_4 whose area is formula_5

Squares are the only regular polygons whose internal angle, central angle, and external angle are all equal (they are all right angles).

==Properties==
A square is a special case of a rhombus (equal sides, opposite equal angles), a kite (two pairs of adjacent equal sides), a trapezoid (one pair of opposite sides parallel), a parallelogram (all opposite sides parallel), a quadrilateral or tetragon (four-sided polygon), and a rectangle (opposite sides equal, right-angles), and therefore has all the properties of all these shapes, namely:
* All four internal angles of a square are equal (each being 90°, a right angle).
* The central angle of a square is equal to 90°.
* The external angle of a square is equal to 90°.
* The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other, meeting at 90°.
* The diagonals of a square bisect its internal angles, forming adjacent angles of 45°.
* All four sides of a square are equal.
* Opposite sides of a square are parallel.

All squares are similar to each-other, meaning they have the same shape, and one parameter (typically the length of a side or diagonal) suffices to specify a square&#x27;s size; squares of the same size are congruent.

===Measurement===
A square whose four sides have length formula_6 has perimeter formula_7 and diagonal length formula_8. (The square root of 2, appearing in this formula, is irrational, meaning that it is not the ratio of any two integers. It is approximately equal to 1.414.) A square&#x27;s area is
formula_9
This formula for the area of a square as the second power of its side length led to the use of the term &quot;squaring&quot; to mean raising any number to the second power. Reversing this relation, the side length of a square of a given area is the square root of the area. Squaring an integer, or taking the area of a square with integer sides, results in a square number; these are figurate numbers representing the numbers of points that can be arranged into a square grid.

Since four squared equals sixteen, a four by four square has an area equal to its perimeter. That is, it is an equable shape. The only other integer rectangle with such a property is a three by six rectangle.

Because it is a regular polygon, a square is the quadrilateral of least perimeter enclosing a given area. Dually, a square is the quadrilateral containing the largest area within a given perimeter. Indeed, if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are the area and perimeter enclosed by a quadrilateral, then the following isoperimetric inequality holds:
formula_10
with equality if and only if the quadrilateral is a square.

===Symmetry===

The square is the most symmetrical of the quadrilaterals. Like all regular polygons, it is an isogonal figure, meaning that it has symmetries taking every vertex to every other vertex, and an isotoxal figure, meaning that it has symmetries taking every edge to every other edge. More strongly, the symmetries of the square and of any other regular polygon act transitively on the flags of the polygon, pairs of a vertex and edge that touch each other. This means that there is a symmetry taking each of the eight flags of the square to each other flag.

There are eight congruence transformations of the plane that take the square to itself:
*Leaving the square unchanged (the identity transformation)
*Rotation around the center of the square by 90°, 180°, or 270°
*Reflection across a diagonal, or across a centerline of the square, parallel to one of its sides.
Combining any two of these transformations by performing one after the other produces another symmetry. This operation on pairs of symmetries gives the eight symmetries of a square the mathematical structure of a point group, the dihedral group of order eight.
The wallpaper groups are symmetry groups of two-dimensional repeating patterns. For many of these groups the basic unit of repetition (the unit cell of its period lattice) can be a square, and for three of these groups, p4, p4m, and p4g, it must be a square.

===Inscribed and circumscribed circles===

The inscribed circle of a square is the largest circle that can fit inside that square. Its center is at the center point of the square, and its radius (the inradius of the square) has length formula_11. The inscribed circle touches the sides of the square at their midpoints; because it touches all four sides, the square is a tangential quadrilateral. The circumscribed circle of a square is the circle passing through the four vertices, making the square a cyclic quadrilateral. Its radius, known as the circumradius, has length formula_12. If the inscribed circle of a square formula_13 has tangency points formula_14 on formula_15, formula_16 on formula_17, formula_18 on formula_19, and formula_20 on formula_21, then for any point formula_22 on the inscribed circle,formula_23 If formula_24 is the distance from an arbitrary point in the plane to the vertex of a square and formula_25 is the circumradius of the square, thenformula_26
If formula_27 and formula_24 are the distances from an arbitrary point in the plane to the centroid of the square and its four vertices respectively, then formula_29 and formula_30 where formula_25 is the circumradius of the square.

==Applications==

Squares are so well-established as the shape of tiles that the Latin word tessera, for a small tile as used in mosaics, takes its derivation from a variant of the ancient Greek word for the number four, referring to the four corners of a square tile. Graph paper, preprinted with a square tiling, has been widely used for data visualization using Cartesian coordinates since its invention in 1794. The pixels of bitmap images, as recorded by image scanners and digital cameras or displayed on electronic visual displays, conventionally lie at the intersections of a square grid, and are often considered as small squares, arranged in a square tiling. Many standard techniques for image compression and video compression, including the JPEG format, are based on the subdivision of images into larger square blocks of pixels. The quadtree data structure used in data compression and computational geometry is based on the recursive subdivision of squares into smaller squares.
Many architectural structures from both ancient and modern cultures have featured a square floor plan, base, or footprint. Ancient examples include the Egyptian pyramids, Mesoamerican pyramids such as those at Teotihuacan, the Chogha Zanbil ziggurat in what is now Iran, the four-fold design of Persian walled gardens, said to model the four rivers of Paradise,
and later structures inspired by their design such as the Taj Mahal in India, the square bases of many Buddhist stupas, and East Asian pagodas, buildings that symbolically face to the four points of the compass and reach to the heavens. Norman keeps such as the Tower of London often take the form of a low square tower. In modern architecture, a majority of skyscrapers feature a square plan for pragmatic rather than aesthetic or symbolic reasons.
On a smaller scale, the stylized nested squares of a Tibetan mandala, like the design of a stupa, function as a miniature model of the cosmos. Some formats for film photography use a square aspect ratio, notably many Polaroid cameras, medium format cameras, and Kodak Instamatic cameras. Artists whose works have used square frames and forms include Josef Albers, Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian.
Baseball diamonds and modern boxing rings are square despite being named for other shapes. The square go board is said to represent the earth, with the 361 crossings of its lines representing days of the year. The chessboard inherited its square shape from a pachisi-like Indian race game and in turn passed it on to checkers. In two ancient games from Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt, the Royal Game of Ur and Senet, the game board itself is not square, but rectangular, subdivided into a grid of squares. The ancient Greek Ostomachion puzzle (according to some interpretations) involves rearranging the pieces of a square cut into smaller polygons, as does the Chinese tangram. Another set of puzzle pieces, the polyominos, are formed from squares glued edge-to-edge. Medieval and Renaissance horoscopes were often arranged in a square format, across Europe, the Middle East, and China. Other recreational uses of squares include the shape of origami paper, and a common style of quilting involving the use of square quilt blocks.
Squares are a common element of graphic design, often used to give a sense of stability, symmetry, and order. In heraldry, a canton (a design element in the top left of a shield) is normally square, and a square flag is called a banner. The flag of Switzerland is square, as are the flags of the Swiss cantons. QR codes are square and feature prominent nested square alignment marks in three corners. Robertson screws have a square drive socket. Crackers and sliced cheese are often square, as are waffles. Square foods named for their square shapes include caramel squares, date squares, lemon squares, square sausage, and Carré de l&#x27;Est cheese.

Human motion can follow a square pattern. In dances such as the quadrille or the square dance, four couples form the sides of a square. In Samuel Beckett&#x27;s minimalist television play &quot;Quad&quot;, four actors walk around the perimeter and along the diagonals of a square.

==Constructions==
===Coordinates and equations===

A unit square is a square of side length one. Often it is represented in Cartesian coordinates as the square enclosing the points formula_32 that have formula_33 and formula_34.

An axis-parallel square with its center at the point formula_35 and sides of length formula_36 (where formula_37 is the inradius, half the side length) has vertices at the four points formula_38. Its interior consists of the points formula_32 with formula_40, and its boundary consists of the points with formula_41.

A diagonal square with its center at the point formula_35 and diagonal of length formula_43 (where formula_25 is the circumradius, half the diagonal) has vertices at the four points formula_45 and formula_46. Its interior consists of the points formula_32 with formula_48, and its boundary consists of the points with formula_49. For instance the illustration shows a diagonal square centered at the origin formula_50 with circumradius 2, given by the equation formula_51.
In the plane of complex numbers, multiplication by the imaginary unit formula_52 rotates the other term in the product by 90° around the origin (the number zero). Therefore, if any nonzero complex number formula_53 is repeatedly multiplied by formula_52, giving the four numbers formula_53, formula_56, formula_57, and formula_58, these numbers will form the vertices of a square centered at the origin. If one interprets the real part and imaginary part of these four complex numbers as Cartesian coordinates, with formula_59, then these four numbers have the coordinates formula_32, formula_61, formula_62, and formula_63. Addition of complex numbers corresponds to translation of the complex plane, so this origin-centered square can be translated to have any other center formula_3 by adding the complex number formula_3 to each of its four vertices. Alternately, taking the origin and the complex number formula_66 as two of its vertices, a square can be formed of the vertices formula_67formula_68.

The Gaussian integers, complex numbers with integer real and imaginary parts, form a square lattice in the complex plane. If a square&#x27;s vertices are all Gaussian integers, they can be written as formula_69formula_70, in terms of the center formula_3 and half-diagonal formula_53, which will either both be Gaussian integers or both be Gaussian integers offset by formula_73 (that is, complex numbers of the form formula_74, for integers formula_1 and formula_2). Alternately, the vertices can be written as formula_77formula_78, in terms of a Gaussian integer formula_79 representing the position of one vertex and another Gaussian integer formula_66 representing a side.

===Compass and straightedge===
The construction of a square with a given side, using a compass and straightedge, is given in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; I.46. The existence of this construction means that squares are constructible polygons. A regular is constructible exactly when the odd prime factors of formula_81 are distinct Fermat primes, and in the case of a square formula_82 has no odd prime factors so this condition is vacuously true.

&quot;Elements&quot; IV.6–7 also give constructions for a square inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about a circle, respectively.
==Related topics==

Because a square is a convex regular polygon with four sides, its Schläfli symbol is {4}. A truncated square is an octagon. The square is part of two infinite families of regular polytopes, one family which includes the cube in three dimensions and the hypercubes in higher dimensions, and another which includes the regular octahedron in three dimensions and the cross polytopes in higher dimensions. The cube and hypercubes can be given vertex coordinates that are all formula_83, while the octahedron and cross polytopes can be given vertex coordinates that are formula_83 in a single dimension and zero in all other dimensions. In two dimensions, the first system of coordinates produces an axis-parallel square, while the second system of coordinates produces a diagonal square.

The Sierpiński carpet is a square fractal, with square holes. Space-filling curves including the Hilbert curve, Peano curve, and Sierpiński curve cover a square as the continuous image of a line segment. The Z-order curve is analogous but not continuous. Other mathematical functions associated with squares include Arnold&#x27;s cat map and the baker&#x27;s map, which generate chaotic dynamical systems on a square, and the lemniscate elliptic functions, complex functions periodic on a square grid.

===Inscribed squares===
A square is said to be inscribed in a curve whenever all four vertices of the square lie on the curve. It is an unsolved problem in mathematics, the inscribed square problem, whether every simple closed curve has an inscribed square. Some cases of this problem are known to be true; for instance, it is true for every smooth curve. For instance, a square can be inscribed on any circle, which becomes its circumscribed circle. As another special case of the inscribed square problem, a square can be inscribed on the boundary of any convex set. The only other regular polygon with this property is the equilateral triangle. More strongly, there exists a convex set on which no other regular polygon can be inscribed.

For an inscribed square in a triangle, at least one of the square&#x27;s sides lies on a side of the triangle. Every acute triangle has three inscribed squares, one lying on each of its three sides. In a right triangle there are two inscribed squares, one touching the right angle of the triangle and the other lying on the opposite side. An obtuse triangle has only one inscribed square, with a side coinciding with part of the triangle&#x27;s longest side. An inscribed square can cover at most half the area of the triangle it is inscribed into.

===Area and quadrature ===

Conventionally, since ancient times, most units of area have been defined in terms of various squares, typically a square with a standard unit of length as its side, for example a square meter or square inch. The area of an arbitrary rectangle can then be simply computed as the product of its length and its width, and more complicated shapes can be measured by conceptually breaking them up into unit squares or into arbitrary triangles.

In ancient Greek deductive geometry, the area of a planar shape was measured and compared by constructing a square with the same area by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge, a process called &quot;quadrature&quot; or &quot;squaring&quot;. Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; shows how to do this for rectangles, parallelograms, triangles, and then more generally for simple polygons by breaking them into triangular pieces. Some shapes with curved sides could also be squared, such as the lune of Hippocrates and the parabola.

This use of a square as the defining shape for area measurement also occurs in the Greek formulation of the Pythagorean theorem: squares constructed on the two sides of a right triangle have equal total area to a square constructed on the hypotenuse. Stated in this form, the theorem would be equally valid for other shapes on the sides of the triangle, such as equilateral triangles or semicircles, but the Greeks used squares. In modern mathematics, this formulation of the theorem using areas of squares has been replaced by an algebraic formulation involving squaring numbers: the lengths of the sides and hypotenuse of the right triangle obey the equation formula_85.

Because of this focus on quadrature as a measure of area, the Greeks and later mathematicians sought unsuccessfully to square the circle, constructing a square with the same area as a given circle, again using finitely many steps with a compass and straightedge. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem. This theorem proves that pi () is a transcendental number rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. A construction for squaring the circle could be translated into a polynomial formula for , which does not exist.

===Tiling and packing===
The square tiling, familiar from flooring and game boards, is one of three regular tilings of the plane. The others are the tilings made from the equilateral triangle and the regular hexagon. The vertices of the square tiling form a square lattice. Squares of more than one size can also tile the plane, for instance in the Pythagorean tiling, named for its connection to proofs of the Pythagorean theorem.
Square packing problems seek the smallest square or circle into which a given number of unit squares can fit. A chessboard optimally packs a square number of unit squares into a larger square, but beyond a few special cases such as this, the optimal solutions to these problems remain unsolved; the same is true for circle packing in a square. Packing squares into other shapes can have high computational complexity: testing whether a given number of unit squares can fit into an orthogonally convex rectilinear polygon with half-integer vertex coordinates is NP-complete.

Squaring the square involves subdividing a given square into smaller squares, all having integer side lengths. A subdivision with distinct smaller squares is called a perfect squared square. Another variant of squaring the square called &quot;Mrs. Perkins&#x27;s quilt&quot; allows repetitions, but uses as few smaller squares as possible in order to make the greatest common divisor of the side lengths be 1. The entire plane can be tiled by squares, with exactly one square of each integer side length.

===Counting===
A common mathematical puzzle involves counting the squares of all sizes in a square grid of formula_86 squares. For instance, a square grid of nine squares has 14 squares: the nine squares that form the grid, four more formula_87 squares, and one formula_88 square. The answer to the puzzle is formula_89, a square pyramidal number. For formula_90 these numbers are:

A variant of the same puzzle asks for the number of squares formed by a grid of formula_86 points, allowing squares that are not axis-parallel. For instance, a grid of nine points has five axis-parallel squares as described above, but it also contains one more diagonal square for a total of six. In this case, the answer is given by the &quot;4-dimensional pyramidal numbers&quot; formula_92. For formula_90 these numbers are:


Another counting problem involving squares asks for the number of different shapes of rectangle that can be used when dividing a square into similar rectangles. A square can be divided into two similar rectangles only in one way, by bisecting it, but when dividing a square into three similar rectangles there are three possible aspect ratios of the rectangles, 3:1, 3:2, and the square of the plastic ratio. The number of proportions that are possible when dividing into formula_81 rectangles is known for small values of formula_81, but not as a general formula. For formula_90 these numbers are:
&#x27;

===Non-Euclidean geometry===

Squares tilted at 45° to the coordinate axes are the metric balls for taxicab geometry, the formula_97 distance metric in the real coordinate plane. According to this metric, the 
distance between any two points formula_98 and formula_99 is formula_100 instead of the Euclidean distance formula_101. The points with taxicab distance formula_4 from any given point form a diagonal square, centered at the given point, with diagonal length formula_103. In the same way, axis-parallel squares form the metric balls for the formula_104 distance metric (called the Chebyshev distance), for which the distance is given by the formula formula_105. In this metric, the points with distance formula_4 from some point form an axis-parallel square, centered at the given point, with side length formula_103.

Other forms of non-Euclidean geometry, including spherical geometry and hyperbolic geometry, also have polygons with four equal sides and equal angles. These are often called squares, but some authors avoid calling them that, instead calling them regular quadrilaterals, because unlike Euclidean squares they cannot have right angles. These geometries also have regular polygons with right angles, but with numbers of sides different from four.

In spherical geometry, a &quot;square&quot; is a polygon whose edges are great-circle arcs of equal length, which meet at equal angles. Unlike the square of Euclidean geometry, spherical squares have obtuse angles, larger than a right angle. Larger spherical squares have larger angles. An octant of a sphere is a regular spherical triangle consisting of three straight sides and three right angles. The sphere can be tiled by eight such octants to make a spherical octahedron, with four octants meeting at each vertex.

In hyperbolic geometry, squares with right angles do not exist. Rather, squares in hyperbolic geometry have acute angles, less than right angles. Larger hyperbolic squares have smaller angles. It is also possible to make a regular hyperbolic polygon with right angles at every vertex and any number of sides greater than four; such polygons can uniformly tile the hyperbolic plane.

<text>In mathematics, a square is the result of multiplying a number by itself. The verb &quot;to square&quot; is used to denote this operation. Squaring is the same as raising to the power 2, and is denoted by a superscript 2; for instance, the square of 3 may be written as 32, which is the number 9.
In some cases when superscripts are not available, as for instance in programming languages or plain text files, the notations &quot;x&quot;^2 (caret) or &quot;x&quot;**2 may be used in place of &quot;x&quot;2.
The adjective which corresponds to squaring is &quot;&quot;.

The square of an integer may also be called a &quot;square number&quot; or a &quot;perfect square&quot;. In algebra, the operation of squaring is often generalized to polynomials, other expressions, or values in systems of mathematical values other than the numbers. For instance, the square of the linear polynomial is the quadratic polynomial .

One of the important properties of squaring, for numbers as well as in many other mathematical systems, is that (for all numbers ), the square of is the same as the square of its additive inverse . That is, the square function satisfies the identity . This can also be expressed by saying that the square function is an even function.

== In real numbers ==

The squaring operation defines a real function called the &#x27; or the &#x27;. Its domain is the whole real line, and its image is the set of nonnegative real numbers.

The square function preserves the order of positive numbers: larger numbers have larger squares. In other words, the square is a monotonic function on the interval . On the negative numbers, numbers with greater absolute value have greater squares, so the square is a monotonically decreasing function on . Hence, zero is the (global) minimum of the square function.
The square of a number is less than (that is ) if and only if , that is, if belongs to the open interval . This implies that the square of an integer is never less than the original number .

Every positive real number is the square of exactly two numbers, one of which is strictly positive and the other of which is strictly negative. Zero is the square of only one number, itself. For this reason, it is possible to define the square root function, which associates with a non-negative real number the non-negative number whose square is the original number.

No square root can be taken of a negative number within the system of real numbers, because squares of all real numbers are non-negative. The lack of real square roots for the negative numbers can be used to expand the real number system to the complex numbers, by postulating the imaginary unit , which is one of the square roots of −1.

The property &quot;every non-negative real number is a square&quot; has been generalized to the notion of a real closed field, which is an ordered field such that every non-negative element is a square and every polynomial of odd degree has a root. The real closed fields cannot be distinguished from the field of real numbers by their algebraic properties: every property of the real numbers, which may be expressed in first-order logic (that is expressed by a formula in which the variables that are quantified by ∀ or ∃ represent elements, not sets), is true for every real closed field, and conversely every property of the first-order logic, which is true for a specific real closed field is also true for the real numbers.

== In geometry ==
There are several major uses of the square function in geometry.

The name of the square function shows its importance in the definition of the area: it comes from the fact that the area of a square with sides of length   is equal to . The area depends quadratically on the size: the area of a shape  times larger is  times greater. This holds for areas in three dimensions as well as in the plane: for instance, the surface area of a sphere is proportional to the square of its radius, a fact that is manifested physically by the inverse-square law describing how the strength of physical forces such as gravity varies according to distance.

The square function is related to distance through the Pythagorean theorem and its generalization, the parallelogram law. Euclidean distance is not a smooth function: the three-dimensional graph of distance from a fixed point forms a cone, with a non-smooth point at the tip of the cone. However, the square of the distance (denoted or ), which has a paraboloid as its graph, is a smooth and analytic function.

The dot product of a Euclidean vector with itself is equal to the square of its length: . This is further generalised to quadratic forms in linear spaces via the inner product. The inertia tensor in mechanics is an example of a quadratic form. It demonstrates a quadratic relation of the moment of inertia to the size (length).

There are infinitely many Pythagorean triples, sets of three positive integers such that the sum of the squares of the first two equals the square of the third. Each of these triples gives the integer sides of a right triangle.

==In abstract algebra and number theory==
The square function is defined in any field or ring. An element in the image of this function is called a &quot;square&quot;, and the inverse images of a square are called &quot;square roots&quot;.

The notion of squaring is particularly important in the finite fields Z/&quot;pZ formed by the numbers modulo an odd prime number . A non-zero element of this field is called a quadratic residue if it is a square in Z/&quot;pZ, and otherwise, it is called a quadratic non-residue. Zero, while a square, is not considered to be a quadratic residue. Every finite field of this type has exactly quadratic residues and exactly quadratic non-residues. The quadratic residues form a group under multiplication. The properties of quadratic residues are widely used in number theory.

More generally, in rings, the square function may have different properties that are sometimes used to classify rings.

Zero may be the square of some non-zero elements. A commutative ring such that the square of a non zero element is never zero is called a reduced ring. More generally, in a commutative ring, a radical ideal is an ideal  such that formula_1 implies formula_2. Both notions are important in algebraic geometry, because of Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz.

An element of a ring that is equal to its own square is called an idempotent. In any ring, 0 and 1 are idempotents. There are no other idempotents in fields and more generally in integral domains. However, 
the ring of the integers modulo  has idempotents, where is the number of distinct prime factors of .
A commutative ring in which every element is equal to its square (every element is idempotent) is called a Boolean ring; an example from computer science is the ring whose elements are binary numbers, with bitwise AND as the multiplication operation and bitwise XOR as the addition operation.

In a totally ordered ring, for any . Moreover,  if and only if .

In a supercommutative algebra where 2 is invertible, the square of any &quot;odd&quot; element equals zero.

If &quot;A&quot; is a commutative semigroup, then one has
:formula_3
In the language of quadratic forms, this equality says that the square function is a &quot;form permitting composition&quot;. In fact, the square function is the foundation upon which other quadratic forms are constructed which also permit composition. The procedure was introduced by L. E. Dickson to produce the octonions out of quaternions by doubling. The doubling method was formalized by A. A. Albert who started with the real number field formula_4 and the square function, doubling it to obtain the complex number field with quadratic form , and then doubling again to obtain quaternions. The doubling procedure is called the Cayley–Dickson construction, and has been generalized to form algebras of dimension 2n over a field &quot;F&quot; with involution.

The square function &quot;z&quot;2 is the &quot;norm&quot; of the composition algebra formula_5, where the identity function forms a trivial involution to begin the Cayley–Dickson constructions leading to bicomplex, biquaternion, and bioctonion composition algebras.

==In complex numbers==
On complex numbers, the square function formula_6 is a twofold cover in the sense that each non-zero complex number has exactly two square roots. 

The square of the absolute value of a complex number is called its absolute square, squared modulus, or squared magnitude. It is the product of the complex number with its complex conjugate, and equals the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the complex number. 

The absolute square of a complex number is always a nonnegative real number, that is zero if and only if the complex number is zero. It is easier to compute than the absolute value (no square root), and is a smooth real-valued function. Because of these two properties, the absolute square is often preferred to the absolute value for explicit computations and when methods of mathematical analysis are involved (for example optimization or integration).

For complex vectors, the dot product can be defined involving the conjugate transpose, leading to the &quot;squared norm&quot;.

== Other uses ==
Squares are ubiquitous in algebra, more generally, in almost every branch of mathematics, and also in physics where many units are defined using squares and inverse squares: see below.

Least squares is the standard method used with overdetermined systems.

Squaring is used in statistics and probability theory in determining the standard deviation of a set of values, or a random variable. The deviation of each value  from the mean formula_7 of the set is defined as the difference formula_8. These deviations are squared, then a mean is taken of the new set of numbers (each of which is positive). This mean is the variance, and its square root is the standard deviation.

<doc id="659952" wikidata="Q4957512" url="?curid=659952" title="Brannan Island State Recreation Area">
<text>Brannan Island State Recreation Area is a state park unit of California, United States, preserving a maze of waterways in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. The recreation area is located in Sacramento County between Rio Vista and Isleton. This park northeast of San Francisco Bay has countless islands and marshes with many wildlife habitats and many opportunities for recreation, including boating, windsurfing and swimming. The park was established in 1952.

The area offers fishing, including striped bass, sturgeon, catfish, bluegill, perch and bullhead. Southeast, accessed by the San Joaquin River, Frank’s Tract, a protected wetland marsh, is home to beaver, muskrat, river otter, mink and 76 species of birds. Another wetland also managed by Brannan Island&#x27;s Park Rangers is Delta Meadows River Park near the town of Locke. Canoe tours of &#x27;the meadows&#x27; may be reserved on weekends during the spring and fall season through Brannan Island SRA.

Brannan Island SRA has a six-lane launch ramp, over 140 campsites and areas for picnicking and swimming.

The visitor center is open weekends and by arrangement. Inside are displays on the cultural and natural history of the Delta, including a large interactive map of the San Francisco Bay Area and Delta.

Day use areas include the Windy Cove windsurfing access, the group picnic area located at the Ramadas, and Seven Mile Slough picnic area. The group picnic facility and Seven Mile Slough day use area close at sunset. Windy Cove closes at the hour posted at the entrance road to Windy Cove.

Seven Mile Slough picnic area includes picnic tables, barbecues and drinking water. New restroom facilities were completed late in 1997 and include flush toilets and outdoor cold showers. Seven Mile Slough&#x27;s swim beach has lifeguards from Memorial Day through Labor Day. Ample parking is close to the beach.

The Ramadas have shaded picnic structures with large barbecues, picnic tables, water and trash receptacles. A large open grassy area is adjacent to the site for games. The closest restroom to the Ramadas is located north of the swim beach along Seven Mile Slough.

The climate in the Delta is mild, with winter temperatures usually ranging between 45 and 55 degrees and summer temperatures between 75 and 95. An occasional heat wave will push the temperatures in summer to 100 degrees or more but the Delta breeze is never far away.

The park was closed starting April 1, 2022, while California State Parks sought a new operator. The park was partially reopened from June to September, 2022, and fully reopened December 1, 2022, operated by Park Delta Bay, a nearby resort.

<doc id="659958" wikidata="Q4654971" url="?curid=659958" title="Model F keyboard">
<text>The Model F was a series of computer keyboards produced mainly from 1981–1985 and in reduced volume until 1994 by IBM and later Lexmark. Its mechanical-key design consisted of a buckling spring over a capacitive PCB, similar to the later Model M keyboard that used a membrane in place of the PCB.

The Model F first appeared with the IBM System/23 Datamaster all-in-one computer. It is best known as part of the IBM Personal Computer in 1981 with some keycap label differences, and its subsequent release with the IBM Personal Computer/AT, where it was reconfigured with the AT protocol and some layout revisions. After the introduction of the Model M keyboard, production was ramped down and eventually limited to replacement units for existing installations.

The capacitive design is widely considered superior to that of the later membrane design used on the Model M. It has a lighter actuation force of about 600 mN, a crisper feel, and louder feedback. It also has a higher MTBF of over 100 million keypresses, and full n-key rollover. These advantages were sacrificed in the Model M in order to lower manufacturing costs.
==Variations==
Many IBM keyboards were based on Model F technology, featuring different keycaps, layouts and connections:
==Enthusiasts and modern re-creation==
The enthusiast community around the Model M keyboard also prizes Model Fs and restores them for use with modern systems, though fewer are still in use due to lower production volume and a layout that is somewhat awkward and limited by modern standards.

Since 2016 a project has been underway to manufacture for sale keyboards with a faithful re-creation of the model F mechanism, completely independently of IBM. The New Model F has two variants which both resemble the 4704, but with default layouts tweaked in the direction of a Model M (notably using an inverted-T arrow-key cluster rather than the old-fashioned cross layout of the original Model Fs). This project has attracted over 25,000 subscribers and began shipping in December 2019.

==Design==
The Model F&#x27;s key-switch design was more durable than IBM&#x27;s previous beam-spring mechanism, which was prone to failure from debris and was more complex to manufacture and service. The spring assembly consisted of a top metal plate with cut holes where the plastic spring barrels reside; a bottom sheet of metal then holds the assembly together and compresses the contact sheet with a foam spacer. Earlier Model F keyboards cannot have their space bars removed without disassembling the internal assembly; this also causes a slightly different feel response from the space bar specifically: some enthusiasts modify the tension of the stabilizer on these early Model F keyboards to provide a more satisfactory response.

The top metal plates in Model F keyboards are prone to corrosion and the internal foam can also rot from age, which often requires cleaning and a coating to prevent further corrosion. All Model F internal assemblies are held together with metal tabs, unlike the Model M which uses melted plastic rivets requiring more rivets to be melted on or modified with bolts.

A characteristic feature of the Model F is a plastic top shell painted with a cream paint to create a rough texture. The later Model M keyboards used injection plastic rather than paint to achieve this texture. The plastic used in the Model F is quite brittle and prone to hairline cracks, and the paint can wear off from excessive use.

== Comparison with Model M ==

Although the Model F and Model M are both based on buckling-spring technology, there are considerable differences between them:

<doc id="659960" wikidata="Q740353" url="?curid=659960" title="Iron gall ink">
<text>Iron gall ink (also known as common ink, standard ink, oak gall ink or iron gall nut ink) is a purple-black or brown-black ink made from iron salts and tannic acids from vegetable sources. It was the standard ink formulation used in Europe for the 1400-year period between the 5th and 19th centuries, remained in widespread use well into the 20th century, and is still sold today.

==Preparation and use==

The ink was traditionally prepared by adding some iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) to a solution of tannic acid, but any iron ion donor can be used. The gallotannic acid was usually extracted from oak galls or galls of other trees, hence the name. Fermentation or hydrolysis of the extract releases glucose and gallic acid, which yields a darker purple-black ink, due to the formation of iron gallate.

The fermented extract was combined with the iron(II) sulfate. After filtering, the resulting pale-grey solution had a binder added to it (most commonly gum arabic) and was used to write on paper or parchment. A well-prepared ink would gradually darken to an intense purplish black. The resulting marks would adhere firmly to the parchment or vellum, and (unlike india ink or other formulas) could not be erased by rubbing or washing. The marks could only be erased by scraping a thin layer off the writing surface.

== Chemistry ==

By mixing tannin with iron sulfate, a water-soluble ferrous tannate complex is formed. Because of its solubility, the ink is able to penetrate the paper surface, making it difficult to erase. When exposed to air, it converts to a ferric tannate, which is a darker pigment. This product is not water-soluble, contributing to its permanence as a writing ink.

The darkening process of the ink is due to the oxidation of the iron ions from ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) state by atmospheric oxygen. For that reason, the liquid ink needs to be stored in a well-stoppered bottle, and often becomes unusable after a time. The ferric ions react with the tannic acid or some derived compound (possibly gallic acid or pyrogallol) to form a polymeric organometallic compound.

While a very effective ink, the formula was less than ideal. Iron gall ink is acidic. Depending on the writing surface being used, iron gall ink can have unsightly &quot;ghost writing&quot; on the obverse face of the writing surface (most commonly parchment or paper). Ultimately it may eat holes through the surface it was on. This is accelerated by high temperature and humidity. However, some manuscripts written with it, such as the &quot;Book of Magical Charms&quot;, have survived hundreds of years without it damaging the paper on which it was used.

== History ==
The earliest recipes for oak gall ink come from Pliny the Elder, and are vague at best. Many famous and important manuscripts have been written using ferrous oak gall ink, including the Codex Sinaiticus, the oldest, most complete Bible currently known to exist, thought to be written in the middle of the fourth century. Due to the ease of making iron gall ink and its quality of permanence and water resistance this ink became the favored one for scribes in the European corridor as well as around the Mediterranean Sea. Surviving manuscripts from the Middle Ages as well as the Renaissance bear this out as the vast majority are written using iron gall ink, the balance being written using lamp black or carbon black inks. Many drawings by Leonardo da Vinci were made with iron gall ink. Laws were enacted in Great Britain and France specifying the content of iron gall ink for all royal and legal records to ensure permanence in this time period as well.

The popularity of iron gall ink traveled around the world during the colonization period and beyond. The United States Postal Service had its own official recipe that was to be used in all post office branches for the use of their customers. It was not until the invention of chemically-produced inks and writing fluids in the latter half of the 20th century that iron gall ink fell from common use.

== Waning use ==
The permanence and water-resistance of the iron and gall-nut formula made it the standard writing ink in Europe for over 1,400 years, and in America after European colonisation. Its use and production started to decline only in the 20th century, when other waterproof formulas (better suited for writing on paper) became available. Today, iron gall ink is manufactured by a small number of companies and used by fountain pen enthusiasts and artists, but has fewer administrative applications.

While its use is waning globally, it is still required (along with Klaf) by Jewish Halakha for various religious documents, such as a Get, a Ketubah, Mezuzahs, and Torah Scrolls.

== Fountain pens ==


Traditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens are not suitable for fountain pens which operate on the principle of capillary action. Ferro-gallic deposit accumulation in the feed system can clog the small ink passages in fountain pen feeds. Further, very acidic traditional iron gall inks intended for dip pens can corrode metal pen parts (a phenomenon known as redox reaction/flash corrosion). These phenomena can destroy the functionality of fountain pens.

Instead, modern surrogate iron gall formulas are offered for fountain pens, such as blue-black bottled inks by Lamy (discontinued in 2012), Montblanc (discontinued in 2012), Chesterfield Archival Vault (discontinued in 2016), Diamine Registrar&#x27;s Ink, Ecclesiastical Stationery Supplies Registrars Ink, Hero 232, and Organics Studios Aristotle Iron Gall.
Other manufacturers offer besides blue-black other colored iron gall inks such as Gutenberg (certificate ink G10 black), KWZ Iron Gall inks, Platinum Classic inks, Rohrer &amp; Klingner &quot;Salix&quot; (blue-black) and &quot;Scabiosa&quot; (purplish-grey) inks, and Stipula Ferrogallico inks for fountain pens.

These modern iron gall inks contain a small amount of ferro-gallic compounds and are also more likely to have a formulation which is stoichiometrically optimised. Historical inks often contained excess acid which was not consumed in the oxidation of the ferro-gallic compounds. Modern formulations also tend to use hydrochloric acid whereas many historical inks used sulfuric acid. Hydrochloric acid is a gas in solution, which will evaporate. As a result, modern fountain pen iron gall inks are less likely to damage paper than historical inks and are gentler for the inside of a fountain pen, but can still cause problems if left in a pen for a long period. Manufacturers or retailers of modern iron gall inks intended for fountain pens sometimes advise a more thorough than usual cleaning regimen – which requires the ink to be flushed out regularly with water – to avoid clogging or corrosion on delicate pen parts. For more thoroughly cleaning iron gall ink out of a fountain pen, sequential flushes of the pen with water, diluted vinegar or citric acid (to flush out residual iron gall compounds), water, diluted ammonia (if needed to flush out residual colour dye stains), then finally water are often recommended.

The colour dye in these modern iron gall formulas functions as a temporary colourant to make these inks clearly visible whilst writing. The ferro-gallic compounds through a gradual oxidation process cause an observable gradual colour change to grey/black whilst these inks completely dry and makes the writing waterproof. The colour-changing property of the ink also depends on the properties of the used paper. In general, the darkening process will progress more quickly and visibly on papers containing relatively high bleaching agent residues.

Though not in mainstream 21st-century use like dye-based fountain pen inks, modern iron gall inks are still used in fountain pens where permanence is required. In the United Kingdom the use of special blue-black archival quality Registrars&#x27; Ink containing ferro-gallic compounds is required in register offices for official documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, death certificates and on clergy rolls and ships&#x27; logbooks. In Germany the use of special blue or black or documentary use permanent inks is required in (Civil law notary legal instruments).

=== German regulation for inks (1933) ===
* In a litre of ink there must be at least 27 g of tannic acid and gallic acid, and at least 4 g of iron content. The maximum iron content is 6 g/L.
* After 14 days&#x27; storage in a glass container the ink must not have stained the glass or show sedimentation.
* Eight-day-old writings, after washing with water and alcohol, must remain very dark.
* The ink must flow easily from the pen, and may not be sticky even immediately after drying.

===U.S. government &quot;standard ink&quot; formula (1935)===
* 11.7 g tannic acid
* 3.8 g gallic acid 
* 15 g iron(II) sulfate
* 3 cm3 hydrochloric acid (used to prevent sediment forming)
* 1 g carbolic acid (phenol, , biocide) (preservative)
* 3.5 g china-blue aniline dye (water-soluble)
* 1000 cm3 distilled water

The &quot;Popular Science&quot; iron gall writing ink article also mentions methyl violet dye could be used to make a violet iron gall ink without revealing the amount and soluble nigrosine dye for an immediate black iron gall ink. To avoid the toxic carbolic acid biocide used as a preservative in the U.S. government &quot;standard ink&quot; formula, 2 g salicylic acid can be used as a safer biocide alternative to prevent mold in the ink bottle. Both preservatives are enhanced by lowering the pH-value (acidifying the ink by adding hydrochloric acid).

===Indian Standard 220 (1988)===
In India, the IS 220 (1988): Fountain Pen Ink – Ferro-gallo Tannate (0.1 percent iron content) Third Revision standard, which was reaffirmed in 2010, is in use. This Indian Standard was adopted by the Bureau of Indian Standards on 21 November 1988, after the draft finalized by the Inks and Allied Products Sectional Committee had been approved by the Chemical Division Council. IS 220 prescribes the requirements and the methods of sampling and tests for ferrogallo tannate fountain pen inks containing not less than 0.1 percent of iron.

Annex M stipulates that the IS 220 reference ink shall be prepared according to the following formula:
*4.0 g tannic acid
*1.5 g gallic acid
*5.5 g ferrous sulfate crystals 
*5.0 g concentrated hydrochloric acid
*5.0 g dye, ink blue (see IS 8642 : 1977)
*provisional dye (for inks other than blue black) As advised by supplier.
*phenol (see IS 538 : 1968)
*distilled water (to make the total volume one litre).

The IS 220 reference ink shall not be used for more than one month after the date of preparation and shall be stored in amber-coloured reagent bottles (see IS 1388 : 1959).

<doc id="659962" wikidata="Q4999116" url="?curid=659962" title="Burleigh H. Murray Ranch">
<text>Burleigh H. Murray Ranch is a property in the state park system of California in the United States. It is a valley ranch located in San Mateo County inland from Half Moon Bay. The ranch was established in 1857 and became a park in 1979. It was purchased by the State of California in 1983.

A trail from the parking area consists of the old ranch road along Mills Creek. After a mile, it passes a 1930s bungalow that serves as a park ranger residence. The valley narrows between steep chaparral-covered hills. The terrain is navigable for another mile above the Mills Barn and water tanks, until the trail fades into the dense growth of stinging nettles, poison oak, and coyote brush.

==History==
Burleigh H. Murray was born on the ranch July 19, 1865. His father came to California from Vermont during the California Gold Rush and worked as a miner in Auburn. In 1857, he settled on the ranch and began a successful dairy farm.

The Mills Barn, an English-style bank barn beside Mills Creek, is maintained but not restored. It is the only building of this type in California. The foundation of the barn and other buildings, including an un-reinforced arched stone bridge, rely on Italian masonry techniques dating back to Roman times. The barn was originally in length and could house 100 dairy cows.

<doc id="659964" wikidata="Q3695999" url="?curid=659964" title="Gandhāran Buddhist texts">
<text>The Gandhāran Buddhist texts are the oldest Buddhist manuscripts yet discovered, dating from about the 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE and found in the northwestern outskirts of Pakistan. They represent the literature of Gandharan Buddhism and are written in the Gāndhārī language. The texts constitute the largest collection of Gāndhārī manuscripts known to date and are now housed at the Islamabad Museum in Pakistan.

They were sold to European and Japanese institutions and individuals, and are currently being recovered and studied by several universities. The Gandhāran texts are in a considerably deteriorated form (their survival alone is extraordinary), but educated guesses about reconstruction have been possible in several cases using both modern preservation techniques and more traditional textual scholarship, comparing previously known Pāli and Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit versions of texts. Other Gandhāran Buddhist texts—&quot;several and perhaps many&quot;—have been found over the last two centuries but lost or destroyed.

The texts are attributed to the Dharmaguptaka sect by Richard Salomon, the leading scholar in the field, and the British Library scrolls &quot;represent a random but reasonably representative fraction of what was probably a much larger set of texts preserved in the library of a monastery of the Dharmaguptaka sect in Nagarāhāra.&quot;

==Collections==
===The British Library Collection===
In 1994, the British Library acquired a group of some eighty Gandharan manuscript fragments from the first half of the 1st century CE, encompassing twenty‐seven birch‐bark scrolls. These birch bark manuscripts were stored in clay jars, which preserved them. They are thought to have been found in western Pakistan, the location of Gandhara, buried in ancient monasteries. A team has been at work, trying to decipher the manuscripts: several volumes have appeared to date (see below). The manuscripts were written in the Gāndhārī language using the Kharoṣṭhī script and are therefore sometimes also called the &quot;Kharoṣṭhī Manuscripts&quot;.

The collection is composed of a diversity of texts: a &quot;Dhammapada&quot;, discourses of the Buddha such as the &quot;Rhinoceros Sutra&quot;, avadanas and Purvayogas, commentaries and abhidharma texts.

There is evidence to suggest that these texts may belong to the Dharmaguptaka school. There is an inscription on a jar pointing to that school, and there is some textual evidence as well. On a semi-related point, the Gandhāran text of the &quot;Rhinoceros Sutra&quot; contains the word &quot;mahayaṇaṣa&quot;, which some might identify with &quot;Mahayana.&quot; However, according to Salomon, in Kharoṣṭhī orthography there is no reason to think that the phrase in question, &quot;amaṃtraṇa bhoti mahayaṇaṣa&quot; (&quot;there are calls from the multitude&quot;), has any connection to the Mahayana.

===The Senior Collection===
The Senior collection was bought by Robert Senior, a British collector. The Senior collection may be slightly younger than the British Library collection. It consists almost entirely of canonical sutras, and, like the British Library collection, was written on birch bark and stored in clay jars. The jars bear inscriptions referring to Macedonian rather than ancient Indian month names, as is characteristic of the Kaniska era from which they derive. There is a &quot;strong likelihood that the Senior scrolls were written, at the earliest, in the latter part of the first century A.D., or, perhaps more likely, in the first half of the second century. This would make the Senior scrolls slightly but significantly later than the scrolls of the British Library collection, which have been provisionally dated to the first half of the first century.&quot; Salomon writes:

He further reports that the &quot;largest number of parallels for the sutras in the Senior collection are in the &quot;Saṃyutta Nikāya&quot; and the corresponding collections in Sanskrit and Chinese.&quot;

===The Schøyen collection===
The Buddhist works within the Schøyen collection consist of birch bark, palm leaf and vellum manuscripts. They are thought to have been found in the Bamiyan caves of Afghanistan, where refugees were seeking shelter. Most of these manuscripts were bought by a Norwegian collector, named Martin Schøyen, while smaller quantities are in possession of Japanese collectors. These manuscripts date from the second to the 8th century CE. In addition to texts in Gandhāri, the Schøyen collection also contains important early sutric material in Sanskrit.

The Buddhist texts within the Schøyen collection include fragments of canonical Suttas, Abhidharma, Vinaya, and Mahāyāna texts. Most of these manuscripts are written in the Brahmi scripts, while a small portion is written in Gandhāri/Kharoṣṭhī script.

Among the early Dharmaguptaka texts in the Schøyen Collection is a fragment in the Kharoṣṭhī script referencing the Six Pāramitās, a central practice for bodhisattvas in Mahāyāna Buddhism.

===University of Washington===
One more manuscript, written on birch bark in a Buddhist monastery of the Abhidharma tradition, from the 1st or 2nd century CE, was acquired from a collector by the University of Washington Libraries in 2002. It is an early commentary on the Buddha&#x27;s teachings, on the subject of human suffering.

===Library of Congress===
In 2003, the Library of Congress purchased a scroll from a British antiquities dealer. Called the &quot;Bahubuddha Sutra&quot;, or &quot;The Many Buddhas Sutra&quot;, the scroll arrived in pieces in a pen case but retains 80% of the text with the beginning and ending missing due to age. The content is similar to the &quot;Mahāvastu.&quot; They mostly contain educational content.The text is narrated by Gautama Buddha and &quot;tells the story of the 13 Buddhas who preceded him, his own emergence and the prediction of a future Buddha.&quot;

===The Khotan Dharmapada===
In 1892 a copy of the Dhammapada written in the Gandhārī Prakrit was discovered near Khotan in Xinjiang, western China. It was broken up and came to Europe in parts, some going to Russia and some to France, but unfortunately a portion of the manuscript never appeared on the market and seems to have been lost. In 1898 most of the French material was published in the &quot;Journal Asiatique&quot;. In 1962 John Brough published the collected Russian and French fragments with a commentary.

===The &quot;Split&quot; Collection===
About the &quot;Split&quot; collection, Harry Falk writes:

The earliest manuscript from Split collection is the one that contains a series of Avadana tales, mentioning a king and Ajivikas, and Buddhist sects like Dharmaguptakas, Mahasamghikas and Seriyaputras, as well as persons like Upatisya and the thief Aṅgulimāla who gets advice from his wife in Pataliputra. This manuscript is currently held in three glass frames covering around 300 fragments, and the style of handwriting has affinities to Ashokan period. A small fragment was subjected to radiocarbon analysis at the Leibnitz Labor in Kiel, Germany, in 2007, the result was that it is from sometime between 184 BCE and 46 BCE (95.4% probability, two sigma range), and the youngest peak is around 70 BCE, so this reconsideration puts this manuscript, that Harry Falk calls &quot;An Avadana collection&quot;, into the first century BCE. 

In 2012, Harry Falk and Seishi Karashima published a damaged and partial Kharoṣṭhī manuscript of the Mahāyāna &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra&quot;. It is carbon dated to ca. 75 CE (with a two-sigma range of 47-147 CE), making it one of the oldest Buddhist texts in existence. It is very similar to the first Chinese translation of the &quot;Aṣṭasāhasrikā&quot; by Lokakṣema (ca. 179 CE) whose source text is assumed to be in the Gāndhārī language. Comparison with the standard Sanskrit text shows that it is also likely to be a translation from Gāndhāri as it expands on many phrases and provides glosses for words that are not present in the Gāndhārī. This points to the text being composed in Gāndhārī, the language of Gandhāra (in what is now the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, including Peshawar, Taxila and the Swat Valley). The &quot;Split&quot; ms. is evidently a copy of an earlier text, confirming that the text may date before the first century of the common era.

===The Bajaur Collection===
The Bajaur Collection was discovered in 1999, and is believed to be from the ruins of a Buddhist monastery in the Dir District of Pakistan. The name derives from the Bajaur district, whose boundary with the Dir district is marked by the banks of the river where the monastery was situated.

The collection comprises fragments of 19 birch-bark scrolls and contains approximately 22 different texts. Most of the texts are not the work of the same scribe, with as many as 18 different hands identified. The fragments range from small sections only a few centimeters in length to a nearly complete scroll nearly 2m long. It is dated to the 1st-2nd Century CE, and written using the Kharosthi script. The fragments were fixed in frames and used to produce high-quality digital images at the University of Peshawar, with collaboration with the Freie University of Berlin.

Notable texts from the collection include the earliest identified Vinaya text, in the form of a Pratimoksa sutra, and a relatively complete Mahayana text connected with the Buddha Aksobhya showing a well-developed movement in the vein of Pure Land Buddhism. While the majority of the texts in the collection are Buddhist texts, two non-Buddhist works are included in the form of a loan contract and an Arthasastra/Rajnitit text, one of the few known Sanskrit texts composed using the Kharosthi script.

==Published material==
Scholarly critical editions of the texts of the University of Washington and the British Library are being printed by the University of Washington Press in the &quot;Gandhāran Buddhist Texts&quot; series, beginning with a detailed analysis of the Gāndhārī Rhinoceros Sutra including phonology, morphology, orthography, paleography, etc. Material from the Schøyen Collection is published by Hermes Publishing, Oslo, Norway.

The following scholars have published fragments of the Gandhāran manuscripts: Raymond Allchin, Mark Allon, Mark Barnard, Stefan Baums, John Brough, Harry Falk, Andrew Glass, Mei‐huang Lee, Timothy Lenz, Sergey Oldenburg, Richard Salomon and Émile Senart. Some of the published material is listed below:

==Analysis of the manuscripts&#x27; contents==
First studies of these Gandharan manuscripts in 1990’s seemed to show that Sūtra texts were prominent in these collections, but subsequent research showed that such a situation was not evident. Now researchers, like Richard Salomon, consider that Buddhist discourses (sūtras) are actually a small portion of the whole Gandharan texts, especially in the oldest period. These early sūtras tend to be only a few common and popular texts, mostly belonging to Kṣudraka/Khuddaka type of material. Richard Salomon, quoting Anne Blackburn, considers them to be part of a limited “practical canon” used in Gandharan monasteries, he concludes that by comparing them to Sanskrit manuscripts from Xinjiang and katikāvatas instructions from Sri Lankan material.

<text>Joshua &quot;J. D.&quot; Wilkes (born April 18, 1972) is an American visual artist, musician, amateur filmmaker and author. He is best known as the singer for the rock band Legendary Shack Shakers, and is also an accomplished harmonica player, having recorded for such artists as Merle Haggard, Sturgill Simpson, John Carter Cash, Mike Patton, and Hank Williams III in the &quot;American Masters&quot; film &quot;Hank Williams: Honky Tonk Blues&quot;. His song &quot;Swampblood&quot; can be heard on the Grammy-nominated soundtrack for HBO&#x27;s &quot;True Blood&quot; series. Wilkes is a resident of Paducah, Kentucky and is the author of two books, &quot;The Vine That Ate The South&quot; and &quot;Barn Dances and Jamborees Across Kentucky&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Wilkes was born in Baytown, Texas. He holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Studio Art from Kentucky&#x27;s Murray State University.

== Career ==
Wilkes is known as the founder and only remaining original member of the Legendary Shack Shakers, a rockabilly and blues band he formed in Murray, Kentucky, in the mid-1990s. Before forming the band, Wilkes was a performer on the paddle-wheel boat, Paducah Jubilee. He also played harmonica for the neo-vaudeville act &quot;Popularity Showboat&quot;. His first live, professional performance was with the group at the Kentucky State Penitentiary.

Regarding the Shack Shaker&#x27;s &quot;southern gothic&quot; lyricism, Billboard Magazine said &quot;[Wilkes writes] mind-blowing lyrics rife with Biblical references and ruminations of life, death, sin and redemption.&quot;

Wilkes is a Kentucky Colonel.

His contributions to the visual arts include many illustrations, comic strips, and sideshow banners. His satirical &quot;Head Cheese&quot; strip ran in the Nashville &quot;RAGE/Metromix&quot; weekly from 2005 to 2008. Other illustrative works by Wilkes have been published in &quot;Juxtapoz&quot;, &quot;Snicker&quot;, &quot;Mineshaft&quot;, &quot;ALARM Magazine&quot;, and TopShelfComix.com. Wilkes illustrated the book &quot;Spookiest Stories Ever&quot; for the University Press of Kentucky, released in 2010.

In October 2013, The History Press published Wilkes&#x27; book &quot;Barn Dances and Jamborees Across Kentucky&quot;, a history of traditional music get-togethers in the Bluegrass State.

In 2006, Wilkes, began work on a documentary film titled &quot;Seven Signs&quot;, that explored &quot;music, myth, and the American South&quot;. The film premiered on December 30, 2007, at the Belcourt Theatre in Nashville, Tennessee and debuted in the UK at London&#x27;s prestigious Raindance Film Festival. In early 2009, Wilkes formed The Dirt Daubers, an old-time roots-influenced side project with his now ex-wife, Jessica, and &quot;Slow&quot; Layne Hendrickson. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut was released in October 2009. They were later referred to as JD Wilkes and the Dirt Daubers.

Occasionally, Wilkes and the Shack Shakers appear in the Danish theatrical production F.U.B.A.R., a production of Copenhagen&#x27;s Mute Comp Theatre. The play, which tackles the subject of illegal gun trade around the globe, features a speaking part by Wilkes. He also reprised his &quot;gothic preacher&quot; character (developed for Shooter Jennings&#x27; &quot;The Real Me&quot; video) when he acted as the presenter at the 2013 Addy Awards in Cincinnati, Ohio.

In May 2014, Wilkes was selected by mayor Gayle Kaler to represent his home city of Paducah, Kentucky, in a cultural exchange with The Lord Mayor of Dublin, Ireland. Wilkes was met by author/actor/playwright and deputy Lord Mayor Gerard Mannix Flynn at the Mansion House in Dublin, where the two exchanged gifts as part of a UNESCO-sponsored reception.

In March 2017, independent publisher Two-Dollar Radio released Wilkes&#x27;s novel &quot;The Vine That Ate The South&quot;, a book praised by NPR as &quot;undeniably one of the smartest, most original Southern Gothic novels to come along in years&quot;. &quot;Wilkes’ ability to spin a story and craft language that&#x27;s as inventive and clever as the book&#x27;s plot combine to create something special that&#x27;s a bit of a contradiction itself—a book that feels both classic and new, mythic and modern&quot;.
