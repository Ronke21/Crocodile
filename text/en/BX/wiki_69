<doc id="679693" wikidata="Q66711956" url="?curid=679693" title="Iraqi Kurdistan">
<text>Iraqi Kurdistan or Southern Kurdistan () refers to the Kurdish-populated part of northern Iraq. It is considered one of the four parts of Greater Kurdistan in West Asia, which also includes parts of southeastern Turkey (Northern Kurdistan), northern Syria (Western Kurdistan), and northwestern Iran (Eastern Kurdistan). Much of the geographical and cultural region of Iraqi Kurdistan is part of the Kurdistan Region (KRI), a semi-autonomous region recognized by the Constitution of Iraq. As with the rest of Kurdistan, and unlike most of the rest of Iraq, the region is inland and mountainous.

==Etymology==
The exact origins of the name &quot;Kurd&quot; are unclear. The suffix &quot;-stan&quot; is an Iranian term for region. The literal translation for Kurdistan is &quot;Land of Kurds&quot;.

The name was also formerly spelled &quot;Curdistan&quot;. One of the ancient names of Kurdistan is &quot;Corduene&quot;.

==Geography==


Iraqi Kurdistan is largely mountainous, with the highest point being a 3,611 m (11,847 ft) point known locally as Cheekha Dar (&quot;black tent&quot;). Mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan include the Zagros, Sinjar Mountains, Hamrin Mountains, Mount Nisir and Qandil mountains. There are many rivers running through the region, which is distinguished by its fertile lands, plentiful water, and picturesque nature. The Great Zab and the Little Zab flow east–west in the region. The Tigris river enters Iraqi Kurdistan from Turkish Kurdistan.

The mountainous nature of Iraqi Kurdistan, the difference of temperatures in its various parts, and its numerous bodies of water make it a land of agriculture and tourism. The largest lake in the region is Lake Dukan. There are also several smaller lakes, such as Darbandikhan Lake and Duhok Lake. The western and southern parts of Iraqi Kurdistan are not as mountainous as the east. Instead, it is rolling hills and plains vegetated by sclerophyll scrubland.

===Climate===

Due to its latitude and altitude, Iraqi Kurdistan is cooler and much wetter than the rest of Iraq. Most areas in the region fall within the Mediterranean climate zone (&quot;Csa&quot;), with areas to the southwest being semi-arid (&quot;BSh&quot;).

Average summer temperatures range from in the cooler northernmost areas to blistering in the southwest, with lows around to . Winters, however, are dramatically cooler than the rest of Iraq, with highs averaging between and and with lows hovering around in some areas and freezing in others, dipping to and on average.

Among other cities in the climate table below, Soran, Shaqlawa and Halabja also experience lows which average below in winter. Duhok has the hottest summers in the region, with highs averaging around . Annual rainfall differs across Iraqi Kurdistan, with some places seeing rainfall as low as in Erbil to as high as in places like Amadiya. Most of the rain falls in winter and spring, and is usually heavy. Summer and early autumn are virtually dry, and spring is fairly tepid. Iraqi Kurdistan sees snowfall occasionally in the winter, and frost is common. There is a seasonal lag in some places in summer, with temperatures peaking around August and September.

== Economy ==
The provinces of Duhok, Erbil and Sulaymanyah are rich in agricultural lands. Wheat and other cereals are grown there. Most of the areas are rainfed, but there are also some smaller irrigation systems in place. Tourism is another branch which draws the attention of the KRI, which achieved the declaration of Erbil as the Tourism Capital by the Arab Council of Tourism in 2014.

==History==
===Pre-Islamic period===

In prehistoric times, the region was home to a Neanderthal culture such as has been found at the Shanidar Cave. The region was host to the Jarmo culture . The earliest neolithic site in Kurdistan is at Tell Hassuna, the centre of the &quot;Hassuna culture&quot;, .

In Early and Middle Bronze Age the region was geographically known as Subartu and was inhabited by the Hurrian speaking Subarians along with Gutians and Lullubi. In 2200 BCE Naram-Sin of Akkad conquered the region and it came under the rule of the Gutians in 2150 BCE. The main cities of the region attested in the inscriptions in this period are Mardaman, Azuhinum, Ninet (Nineveh), Arrapha, Urbilum, and Kurda.

In early 2nd millennium the region was ruled by the kingdom of Kurda except for two decades in 18th century BCE when it was conquered by the Amorite Shamshi Adad and was incorporated into the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia. In 1760s BCE the kingdom of Kurda faced an invasion by Elam and Eshnunna during the Babylonian-Elam war and the kingdom eventually sided with Mari and Babylon.

In 16th century BCE the Mitannians incorporated the region into their Hurrian empire. Following the destruction of the Mitannian Empire by the Hittites, between 14th-13th century BCE the region gradually came under the rule of the Assyrians. Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century BCE finally conquered the whole region and appointed one of his commanders as the governor of the villages and towns of Kurda. Kurda was reduced to a province centering around modern Sinjar. Erbil&#x27;s name was Akkadianized to Arba-ilu and during the Neo-Assyrian Empire the city was noted for its distinctive cult of Ishtar. The region was partially under the rule of Urartu and the kingdom of Musasir in early 1st millennium BCE. Modern Rawandiz district was a religious center of the Urartians.

The Medes conquered the region in 7th century BCE. Later it came under the rule of the Achaemenids and remained as part of the satrapy of Media. When Xenophon passed through the region in 4th century BCE, it was inhabited by the Medes. In 332 BC the region fell to Alexander The Great and was thereafter ruled by the Greek Seleucid Empire until the middle of the second century BCE when it fell to Mithridates I of Parthia. During the four centuries of the Parthian era (247 BCE to 226 AD) the region was ruled by semi-independent principalities of Barzan and Sharazur, and in 1st century it was partially under the rule of the Jewish kingdom of Adiabene. Between 3rd and 4th centuries the region was ruled by the House of Kayus until it was incorporated into the Sassanian Empire in 380 AD and it was renamed to Nodshēragān. The region was gradually converted to Christianity between 1st and 5th centuries and Erbil became the seat of the metropolitan of Hadhyab of the Church of the East and it was divided into several bishoprics namely Marga, Beth Garmai, Beth Qardu, Beth MahQard, Beth BihQard, Beth Nuhadra and Shahr-Qard. In Syriac the region was commonly called Beth Qardwaye.

===Islamic period===

The region was conquered by Arab Muslims in the mid 7th century AD as the invading forces conquered the Sassanian Empire, the region fell to Muslims after they fought the Kurds in Mosul and Tikrit &#x27;Utba ibn Farqad captured all the forts of the Kurds when he conquered Erbil in 641. The area became part of the Muslim Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, and later the Abbasid Caliphates, before becoming part of various Iranian, Turkic, and Mongol emirates. Following the disintegration of the Ak Koyunlu, all of its territories including what is modern-day Iraqi Kurdistan passed to the Iranian Safavids in the earliest 16th century.

Between the 16th and 17th century the area nowadays known as Iraqi Kurdistan, (formerly ruled by three principalities of Baban, Badinan, and Soran) was continuously passed back and forth between archrivals the Safavids and the Ottomans, until the Ottomans managed to decisively seize power in the region starting from the mid 17th century through the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39) and the resulting Treaty of Zuhab. In the early 18th century, it briefly passed to the Iranian Afsharids led by Nader Shah. Following Nader&#x27;s death in 1747, Ottoman suzerainty was reimposed, and in 1831, direct Ottoman rule was established which lasted until World War I, when the Ottomans were defeated by the British.

===Kurdish revolts under British control===
During World War I, the British and French divided West Asia in the Sykes-Picot Agreement. The Treaty of Sèvres (which did not enter into force), and the Treaty of Lausanne which superseded it, led to the advent of modern West Asia and the modern Republic of Turkey. The League of Nations granted France mandates over Syria and Lebanon and granted the United Kingdom mandates over Palestine (which then consisted of two autonomous regions: Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan) and what was to become Iraq. Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the Arabian Peninsula were eventually taken over by Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

In 1922, Britain restored Shaikh Mahmud Barzanji to power, hoping that he would organize the Kurds to act as a buffer against the Turks, who had territorial claims over Mosul and Kirkuk. However, defiant to the British, in 1922 Shaikh Mahmud declared a Kurdish Kingdom with himself as king. It took two years for the British to bring Kurdish areas into submission, while Shaikh Mahmud found refuge in an unknown location.

In 1930, following the announcement of the admission of Iraq to the League of Nations, Shaikh Mahmud started a third uprising which was suppressed with British air and ground forces.

By 1927, the Barzani clan had become vocal supporters of Kurdish rights in Iraq. In 1929, the Barzani demanded the formation of a Kurdish province in northern Iraq. Emboldened by these demands, in 1931 Kurdish notables petitioned the League of Nations to set up an independent Kurdish government. In late 1931, Ahmed Barzani initiated a Kurdish rebellion against Iraq, and though defeated within several months, the movement gained a major importance in the Kurdish struggle later on, creating the ground for such a notable Kurdish rebel as Mustafa Barzani.

During World War II, the power vacuum in Iraq was exploited by the Kurdish tribes and under the leadership of Mustafa Barzani a rebellion broke out in the north, effectively gaining control of Kurdish areas until 1945, when Iraqis could once again subdue the Kurds with British support. Under pressure from the Iraqi government and the British, the most influential leader of the clan, Mustafa Barzani was forced into exile in Iran in 1945. Later he moved to the Soviet Union after the collapse of the Republic of Mahabad in 1946.

===Barzani Revolt (1960–1970)===
After the military coup by Arab nationalists on the 14 July 1958, Mustafa Barzani was invited by Abdul Karim Qasim to return from exile, where he was greeted with a hero&#x27;s welcome. As part of the deal arranged between Qasim and Barzani, Qasim had promised to give the Kurds regional autonomy in return for Barzani&#x27;s support for his policies. The Provisional Constitution described Iraq being included in the Arab world but saw the Kurds as partners within an Iraqi statehood and the coat of arms included a Kurdish dagger besides the Arab sword. Meanwhile, during 1959–1960, Barzani became the head of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which was granted legal status in 1960. By early 1960, it became apparent that Qasim would not follow through with his promise of regional autonomy. As a result, the KDP began to agitate for regional autonomy. In the face of growing Kurdish dissent, as well as Barzani&#x27;s personal power, Qasim began to incite the Barzanis historical enemies, the &quot;Baradost&quot; and &quot;Zebari&quot; tribes, which led to intertribal warfare throughout 1960 and early 1961.
By February 1961, Barzani had successfully defeated the pro-government forces and consolidated his position as leader of the Kurds. At this point, Barzani ordered his forces to occupy and expel government officials from all Kurdish territory. This was not received well in Baghdad, and the Third Kurdish Teachers Congress was cancelled and Qasim even denied that &quot;Kurds&quot; constituted an own nation. Qasim began to prepare for a military offensive against the north to return government control of the region. Meanwhile, in June 1961, the KDP issued a detailed ultimatum to Qasim outlining Kurdish grievances, demanding that the Kurdish language would become an official language in Kurdish majority regions. Qasim ignored the Kurdish demands and continued his planning for war.

It was not until September 10, when an Iraqi army column was ambushed by a group of Kurds, that the Kurdish revolt truly began. In response to the attack, Qasim lashed out and ordered the Iraqi Air Force to indiscriminately bomb Kurdish villages, which ultimately served to rally the entire Kurdish population to Barzani&#x27;s standard. Due to Qasim&#x27;s profound distrust of the Iraqi Army, which he purposely failed to adequately arm (in fact, Qasim implemented a policy of ammunition rationing), Qasim&#x27;s government was not able to subdue the insurrection. This stalemate irritated powerful factions within the military and is said to be one of the main reasons behind the Ba&#x27;athist coup against Qasim in February 1963. In November 1963, after considerable infighting amongst the civilian and military wings of the Ba&#x27;athists, they were ousted by Abdul Salam Arif in a coup. Then, after another failed offensive, Arif declared a ceasefire in February 1964 which provoked a split among Kurdish urban radicals on one hand and Peshmerga (Freedom fighters) forces led by Barzani on the other.

Barzani agreed to the ceasefire and fired the radicals from the party. Following the unexpected death of Arif, whereupon he was replaced by his brother, Abdul Rahman Arif, the Iraqi government launched a last-ditch effort to defeat the Kurds. This campaign failed in May 1966, when Barzani forces thoroughly defeated the Iraqi Army at the Battle of Mount Handrin, near Rawandiz. At this battle, it was said that the Kurds slaughtered an entire brigade. Recognizing the futility of continuing this campaign, Rahamn Arif announced a 12-point peace program in June 1966, which was not implemented due to the overthrow of Rahman Arif in a 1968 coup by the Ba&#x27;ath Party.

The Ba&#x27;ath government started a campaign to end the Kurdish insurrection, which stalled in 1969. This can be partly attributed to the internal power struggle in Baghdad and also tensions with Iran. Moreover, the Soviet Union pressured the Iraqis to come to terms with Barzani. A peace plan was announced in March 1970 and provided for broader Kurdish autonomy. The plan also gave Kurds representation in government bodies, to be implemented in four years. Despite this, the Iraqi government embarked on an Arabization program in the oil rich regions of Kirkuk and Khanaqin in the same period.

In the following years, Baghdad government overcame its internal divisions and concluded a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in April 1972 and ended its isolation within the Arab world. On the other hand, Kurds remained dependent on the Iranian military support and could do little to strengthen their forces.

===Second Kurdish Iraqi War Algiers Agreement===
In 1973, the US made a secret agreement with the Shah of Iran to begin covertly funding Kurdish rebels against Baghdad through the Central Intelligence Agency and in collaboration with the Mossad, both of which would be active in the country through the launch of the Iraqi invasion and into the present. By 1974, the Iraqi government retaliated with a new offensive against the Kurds and pushed them close to the border with Iran. Iraq informed Tehran that it was willing to satisfy other Iranian demands in return for an end to its aid to the Kurds. With mediation by Algerian President Houari Boumediene, Iran and Iraq reached a comprehensive settlement in March 1975 known as the &quot;Algiers Pact&quot;. The agreement left the Kurds helpless and Tehran cut supplies to the Kurdish movement. Barzani went to Iran with many of his supporters. Others surrendered &quot;en masse&quot; and the rebellion ended after a few days.

As a result, the Iraqi government extended its control over the northern region after 15 years and in order to secure its influence, started an Arabization program by moving Arabs to the vicinity of oil fields in northern Iraq, particularly those around Kirkuk, and other regions, which were populated by Turkmen, Kurds and Christians. The repressive measures carried out by the government against the Kurds after the Algiers agreement led to renewed clashes between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish guerrillas in 1977. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to the other parts of the country.

===Arabization campaign and PUK insurgency===

The Ba&#x27;athist government of Iraq forcibly displaced and culturally Arabized minorities (Kurds, Yezidis, Assyrians, Shabaks, Armenians, Turkmen, Mandeans), in line with settler colonialist policies, from the 1960s to the early 2000s, in order to shift the demographics of North Iraq towards Arab domination. The Baath party under Saddam Hussein engaged in active expulsion of minorities from the mid-1970s onwards. In 1978 and 1979, 600 Kurdish villages were burned down and around 200,000 Kurds were deported to the other parts of the country.

The campaigns took place during the Iraqi–Kurdish conflict, being largely motivated by the Kurdish–Arab ethnic and political conflict. Arab settlement programs reached their peak during the late 1970s, in line with depopulation efforts of the Ba&#x27;athist regime. The Baathist policies motivating those events are sometimes referred to as &quot;internal colonialism&quot;, described by Dr. Francis Kofi Abiew as a &quot;Colonial &#x27;Arabization program, including large-scale Kurdish deportations and forced Arab settlement in the region.

===Iran–Iraq War and Anfal Campaign===


During the Iran–Iraq War, the Iraqi government again implemented anti-Kurdish policies and a &quot;de facto&quot; civil war broke out. Iraq was widely condemned by the international community, but was never seriously punished for oppressive measures, including the use of chemical weapons against the Kurds, which resulted in thousands of deaths. The Anfal campaign constituted a systematic genocide of the Kurdish people in Iraq.

The second and more extensive and widespread wave began from March 29, 1987, until April 23, 1989, when the Iraqi army under the command of Saddam Hussein &amp; Ali Hassan al-Majid carried out a genocidal campaign against the Kurds, characterized by the following human rights violations: The widespread use of chemical weapons, the wholesale destruction of some 2,000 villages, and slaughter of around 50,000 rural Kurds, by the most conservative estimates. The large Kurdish town of Qala Dizeh (population 70,000) was completely destroyed by the Iraqi army. The campaign also included Arabization of Kirkuk, a program to drive Kurds and other ethnic groups out of the oil-rich city and replace them with Arab settlers from central and southern Iraq.

===Autonomous period===
====After the Persian Gulf War====
Even though autonomy had been agreed in 1970, the local population did not enjoy any democratic freedom, facing similar conditions to the rest of Iraq. Things began to change after the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein at the end of the Persian Gulf War. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 gave birth to a &quot;safe haven&quot; following international concern for the safety of Kurdish refugees. The U.S. and the Coalition established a No Fly Zone over a large part of northern Iraq (see Operation Provide Comfort), however, it left out Sulaymaniyah, Kirkuk and other important Kurdish populated regions. Bloody clashes between Iraqi forces and Kurdish troops continued and, after an uneasy and shaky balance of power was reached, the Iraqi government fully withdrew its military and other personnel from the region in October 1991 allowing Iraqi Kurdistan to function de facto independently. The region was to be ruled by the two principal Kurdish parties; the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The region also has its own flag and national anthem.

At the same time, Iraq imposed an economic blockade over the region, reducing its oil and food supplies. Elections held in June 1992 produced an inconclusive outcome, with the assembly divided almost equally between the two main parties and their allies. During this period, the Kurds were subjected to a double embargo: one imposed by the United Nations on Iraq and one imposed by Saddam Hussein on their region. The severe economic hardships caused by the embargoes fueled tensions between the two dominant political parties, the KDP and the PUK, over control of trade routes and resources. Relations between the PUK and the KDP started to become dangerously strained from September 1993 after rounds of amalgamations occurred between parties.

After 1996, 13% of the Iraqi oil sales were allocated for Iraqi Kurdistan and this led to relative prosperity in the region. In return, the Kurds under KDP enabled Saddam to establish an oil smuggling route through territory controlled by the KDP, with the active involvement of senior Barzani family members. The taxation of this trade at the crossing point between Saddam&#x27;s territory and Kurdish controlled territory and then into Turkey, along with associated service revenue, meant that whoever controlled Dohuk and Zakho had the potential to earn several million dollars a week. Direct United States mediation led the two parties to a formal ceasefire in what was termed the &quot;Washington Agreement&quot; in September 1998. It is also argued that the Oil-for-Food Programme from 1997 onward had an important effect on cessation of hostilities.

====During and after US-led invasion====
Iraqi Kurds played an important role in the Iraq War. Kurdish parties joined forces against the Iraqi government during the war in Spring 2003. Kurdish military forces, known as Peshmerga, played an important role in the overthrow of the Iraqi government; however, Kurds have been reluctant to send troops into Baghdad since then, preferring not to be dragged into the sectarian struggle that dominates much of Iraq.

A new constitution of Iraq was established in 2005, defining Iraq as a federalist state consisting of Regions and Governorate&#x27;s. The Kurdistan region includes the Governorate Erbil, Sulaymaniyah and Duhok. It recognized both the Kurdistan Region and all laws passed by the KRG since 1992. There is provision for Governorates to create, join or leave Regions. However, as of late 2015, no new Regions have been formed, and the KRG remains the only regional government within Iraq.

PUK leader Jalal Talabani was elected President of the new Iraqi administration, while KDP leader Masoud Barzani became President of the Kurdistan Regional Government.

====Following US withdrawal====

Tensions between Iraqi Kurdistan and the central Iraqi government mounted through 2011–2012 on the issues of power sharing, oil production and territorial control. In April 2012, the president of Iraq&#x27;s semi-autonomous northern Kurdish region demanded that officials agree to their demands or face the prospect of secession from Baghdad by September 2012.

In September 2012, the Iraqi government ordered the KRG to transfer its powers over the Peshmerga to the central government. Relations became further strained by the formation of a new command center (Tigris Operation Command) for Iraqi forces to operate in a disputed area over which both Baghdad and the Kurdistan Regional Government claim jurisdiction. On 16 November 2012 a military clash between the Iraqi forces and the Peshmerga resulted in one person killed. CNN reported that two people were killed (one of them an Iraqi soldier) and ten wounded in clashes at the Tuz Khurmato town.

As of 2014, Iraqi Kurdistan is in dispute with the Federal Iraqi government on the issues of territorial control, export of oil and budget distribution and is functioning largely outside Baghdad&#x27;s control. With the escalation of the Iraqi crisis and fears of Iraq&#x27;s collapse, Kurds have increasingly debated the issue of independence. During the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, Iraqi Kurdistan seized the city of Kirkuk and the surrounding area, as well as most of the disputed territories in Northern Iraq. On 1 July 2014, Masoud Barzani announced that &quot;Iraq&#x27;s Kurds will hold an independence referendum within months.&quot; After previously opposing the independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, Turkey later gave signs that it could recognize an independent Kurdish state. On 11 July 2014, KRG forces seized control of the Bai Hassan and Kirkuk oilfields, prompting a condemnation from Baghdad and a threat of &quot;dire consequences&quot; if the oilfields were not relinquished back to Iraq&#x27;s control.
In September, Kurdish leaders decided to postpone the referendum so as to focus on the fight against ISIL. In November, Ed Royce, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives, introduced legislation to arm the Kurds directly, rather than continue working through the local governments.

In August 2014, the US began a campaign of airstrikes in Iraq, in part to protect Kurdish areas such as Erbil from the militants.

In February 2016, Kurdish president Barzani stated once again that &quot;Now the time is ripe for the people of Kurdistan to decide their future through a referendum&quot;, supporting an independence referendum and citing similar referendums in Scotland, Catalonia and Quebec. On March 23, Barzani officially declared that Iraqi Kurdistan will hold the referendum some time &quot;before October&quot; of that year. On April 2, 2017, the two governing parties released a joint statement announcing they would form a joint committee to prepare for a referendum to be held on 25 September.

The 2017 Kurdistan Region independence referendum took place on September 25, with 92.73% voting in favor of independence. This triggered a military operation in which the Iraqi government retook control of Kirkuk and surrounding areas, and forced the KRG to annul the referendum. Scholars have argued that the retaking of Kirkuk, a PUK stronghold, and the loss of other territory to Iraq, has actually consolidated the power of the Barzani family and the KDP, who remain in power. Following Kurdistan Region’s failed attempt to achieve independence after its referendum in 2017, the government of Iraq has exacted severe punishment against KRI in a number of punitive measures; ultimately striving to remove its autonomy. Some Kurdish officials in Iraq have described this as evidence of the Iraqi government’s aim to return to a centralised political system and abandon the federal system it adopted in 2005. In September 2023, the prime minister of KRG, Masrour Barzani sent a letter to the president of the United States, imploring him to intervene, and warning of a potential collapse of Kurdistan Region and the “federal model” in Iraq.

==Culture==
Kurdish culture is a group of distinctive cultural traits practiced by Kurdish people. The Kurdish culture is a legacy from the various ancient peoples who shaped modern Kurds and their society, but primarily Iranian. Among their neighbours, the Kurdish culture is closest to Persian culture. For example, they celebrate Newroz as the new year day, which is celebrated on March 21. It is the first day of the month of &quot;Xakelêwe&quot; in Kurdish calendar and the first day of spring.

<doc id="679694" wikidata="Q1075382" url="?curid=679694" title="Han Feizi">
<text>The Han Feizi () is an ancient Chinese text attributed to the Legalist political philosopher Han Fei. It comprises a selection of essays in the Legalist tradition, elucidating theories of state power, and synthesizing the methodologies of his predecessors. Its 55 chapters, most of which date to the Warring States period , are the only such text to survive fully intact. The Han Feizi is believed to contain the first commentaries on the &quot;Dao De Jing&quot;. Traditionally associated with the Qin dynasty, succeeding emperors and reformers were still influenced by Shen Buhai and the Han Feizi, with Shang Yang&#x27;s current again coming to prominence in the time of Emperor Wu.

Often considered the &quot;culminating&quot; or &quot;greatest&quot; Legalist texts, Han Fei was dubbed by A. C. Graham amongst as the &quot;great synthesizer&quot; of &#x27;Legalism&#x27;&quot;. Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot; incorporates both a Daoist philosophy of inaction and impartiality, and a &#x27;Legalist&#x27; system of punishment and rewards, recalling Han Fei&#x27;s use of the concepts of power and technique.

Among the most important philosophical classics in ancient China, it touches on administration, diplomacy, war and economics, and is also valuable for its abundance of anecdotes about pre-Qin China. Though differing considerably in style, the coherency of the essays lend themselves to the possibility that much was written by Han Fei himself, and are generally considered more philosophically engaging than the &quot;Book of Lord Shang&quot;. Zhuge Liang is said to have attached great importance to the Han Feizi, as well as to Han Fei&#x27;s predecessor Shen Buhai.

==Late pre-Han dating==
Sima Qian presents Han Fei as a late Warring states figure. Because Sima Qian only mentions a few chapters, it is not possible to outright preclude a Han dynasty origin for the entire work, but it does not mention any Han dynasty events, or avoid any Han dynasty taboos that would prohibit a late Warring States dating. 

Except as compilations, some chapters would have to be at least that late. Chapters 6 and 19 recall the fall of several late Warring states period states. Chapter 6&#x27;s memorial on Having Regulations recalls the fall of Wey in 243bce. Chapter 19&#x27;s Taking Measures recalls Qin&#x27;s conquest of Ye from the Zhao, dated to 236bc. Seemingly written from the context of the late Han state, the chapter could still have conceivably preceded its fall in 230bc, or either Zhao and Wei if they had only yet ceded territory.

Containing some of the first commentaries on the Tao te Ching (Laozi), Chinese scholarship agreed with the west on a late dating for Laozi content in the work. But it also does not contain as much naturalist argument that would be expected of later Daoist works going into the Han dynasty. The Han Feizi itself contributes to a late dating for the modern tao te ching. The Han Feizi is probably reading from an earlier, less metaphysical version, like the Mawangdui silk texts.

==Introduction==

Han Fei describes an interest-driven human nature together with the political methodologies to work with it in the interest of the state and Sovereign, namely, engaging in passive observation, and the systematic use of &quot;fa&quot; () to maintain leadership and manage human resources, its use to increase welfare, and its relation with justice.

Rather than rely too much on worthies, who might not be trustworthy, Han Fei binds their programs to systematic reward and penalty (the &#x27;two handles&#x27;), fishing the subjects of the state by feeding them with interests. That being done, the ruler minimizes his own input, intending to make no judgement apart from observances of the facts. Like Shang Yang and other &quot;fa&quot; philosophers, he admonishes the ruler not to abandon &quot;fa&quot; for any other means, considering it a more practical means for the administration of both a large territory and personnel near at hand.

Han Fei&#x27;s philosophy proceeds from the regicide of his era. Sinologist Goldin writes: &quot;Most of what appears in the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; deals with the ruler&#x27;s relations with his ministers, [who] were regarded as the party most likely, in practice, to cause him harm.&quot; Han Fei quotes the &quot;Springs and Autumns of Tao Zuo&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Less than half of all rulers die of illness.&#x27; If the ruler of men is unaware of this, disorders will be manifold and unrestrained. Thus it is said: If those who benefit from a lord&#x27;s death are many, the ruler will be imperiled.&quot;.

==Confucian comparison==
As compared with the Han Feizi, much of the early Book of Lord Shang is more focused on state power in relation to the general populace, emphasizing agriculture and war. It only really starts to develop ideas of managing ministers later in the work. A notable example, Chapter 24&#x27;s &quot;Interdicts and Encouragements&quot;, begins to develop ideas on power similar to Shen Dao, but is very late in the work and also of likely later dating than its earlier chapters.

Some authors of the Han Feizi took a negative view of Confucianism, and the work has little interest in them as scholars or philosophers. However, at least compared with the Book of Lord Shang, the Han Feizi is arguably still of more Confucian orientation even if it incorporates reward and punishment. Although its much later administrative mechanisms are more complex, the Han Feizi has bureaucratic system of names (roles) that can be still compared with the much earlier Confucian rectification of names, and is more focused on forbidding and encouraging ministers who, rather than the stratocracy of the Book of Lord Shang, may very well be Confucians themselves. 

Although the Han Feizi advocates law, it also criticizes Shang Yang in much the same way that the Confucians critique law. Holding that laws cannot practice themselves, it blames him for too much reliance on law. Substituting the Confucian argument for virtuous worthies with administrative methods, some originating in Shen Buhai, the Han Feizi says of Shang Yang&#x27;s Qin state: &quot;Although the laws were rigorously implemented by the officials, the ruler at the apex lacked methods.&quot;

==&quot;Wu wei&quot;==
Devoting the entirety of Chapter 14, &quot;How to Love the Ministers&quot;, to &quot;persuading the ruler to be ruthless to his ministers&quot;, Han Fei&#x27;s enlightened ruler strikes terror into his ministers by doing nothing (&quot;wu wei&quot;). Discarding his private reason and morality, he shows no personal feelings. The qualities of a ruler, his &quot;mental power, moral excellence and physical prowess&quot; are not as important as his method of government. Applying &quot;Fa&quot; (standards) requires no perfection on the part of the ruler.

If the Han Feizi&#x27;s &quot;wu wei&quot; was derivative of a proto-Daoism, its Dao nonetheless emphasizes autocracy (&quot;Tao does not identify with anything but itself, the ruler does not identify with the ministers&quot;). Accepting that the Han Feizi applies &quot;wu wei&quot; specifically to statecraft, professor Xing Lu nonetheless argues that it actually does consider &quot;wu wei&quot; a virtue, and not just a tool or argument for the ruler to reduce activity and act impartially. The Han Feizi says, &quot;by virtue [&quot;de&quot;] of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to enforce itself.&quot;

With visible usages of Xing-Ming, the Han Feizi&#x27;s chapter 5 Zhudao (道主) or &quot;Way of the Ruler&quot; recalls Laozi and Shen Buhai in parallel style, with the idea of names &quot;rectifying themselves&quot; &quot;anticipated&quot; by Shen Buhai. 

The Han Feizi includes other commentaries on the &quot;Daodejing&quot; that would seem to assert that perspective-less knowledge – an absolute point of view – is possible. But scholarship has generally considered them an addendum, given differences with the rest of the work.

==Performance and title (Xing-Ming)==

Han Fei was notoriously focused on what he termed &quot;xing-ming&quot;, which Sima Qian and Liu Xiang define as &quot;holding actual outcome accountable to &quot;ming&quot; (speech).&quot; In line with both the Confucian and Mohist rectification of names, it is relatable to the Confucian tradition in which a promise or undertaking, especially in relation to a government aim, entails punishment or reward, though the tight, centralized control emphasized by the Han Feizi and predecessor Shen Buhai&#x27;s conflicts with the Confucian idea of the autonomous minister.

Possibly referring to the drafting and imposition of laws and standardized legal terms, &quot;xing-ming&quot; may originally have meant &quot;punishments and names&quot;, but with the emphasis on the latter. It functions through binding declarations (&quot;ming&quot;), like a legal contract. Verbally committing oneself, a candidate is allotted a job, indebting him to the ruler. &quot;Naming&quot; people to (objectively determined) positions, it rewards or punishes according to the proposed job description and whether the results fit the task entrusted by their word, which a real minister fulfils.

Han Fei insists on the perfect congruence between words and deeds. Fitting the name is more important than results. The completion, achievement, or result of a job is its assumption of a fixed form (&quot;xing&quot;), which can then be used as a standard against the original claim (&quot;ming&quot;). A large claim but a small achievement is inappropriate to the original verbal undertaking, while a larger achievement takes credit by overstepping the bounds of office.

Han Fei&#x27;s &#x27;brilliant ruler&#x27; &quot;orders names to name themselves and affairs to settle themselves.&quot;

Assessing the accountability of his words to his deeds, the ruler attempts to &quot;determine rewards and punishments in accordance with a subject&#x27;s true merit&quot; (using Fa). It is said that using names (&quot;ming&quot;) to demand realities (&quot;shi&quot;) exalts superiors and curbs inferiors, provides a check on the discharge of duties, and naturally results in emphasizing the high position of superiors, compelling subordinates to act in the manner of the latter.

Han Fei considers &quot;xing-ming&quot; an essential element of autocracy, saying that &quot;In the way of assuming Oneness names are of first importance. When names are put in order, things become settled down; when they go awry, things become unfixed.&quot; He emphasizes that through this system, earlier developed by Shen Buhai, uniformity of language could be developed, functions could be strictly defined to prevent conflict and corruption, and objective rules (&quot;fa&quot;) impervious to divergent interpretation could be established, judged solely by their effectiveness. By narrowing down the options to exactly one, discussions on the &quot;right way of government&quot; could be eliminated. Whatever the situation (&quot;shi&quot;) brings is the correct Dao.

Though recommending use of Shen Buhai&#x27;s techniques, Han Fei&#x27;s &quot;xing-ming&quot; is both considerably narrower and more specific. The functional dichotomy implied in Han Fei&#x27;s mechanistic accountability is not readily implied in Shen&#x27;s, and might be said to be more in line with the later thought of the Han dynasty linguist Xu Gan than that of either Shen Buhai or his supposed teacher Xun Kuang.

===The &quot;Two Handles&quot;===

Though not entirely accurately, most Han works identify Shang Yang with penal law. Its discussion of bureaucratic control is simplistic, chiefly advocating punishment and reward. Shang Yang was largely unconcerned with the organization of the bureaucracy apart from this. The use of these &quot;two handles&quot; (punishment and reward) nonetheless forms a primary premise of Han Fei&#x27;s administrative theory. However, he includes it under his theory of &quot;shu&quot; (administrative techniques) in connection with &quot;xing-ming&quot;.

As a matter of illustration, if the &quot;keeper of the hat&quot; lays a robe on the sleeping Emperor, he has to be put to death for overstepping his office, while the &quot;keeper of the robe&quot; has to be put to death for failing to do his duty. The philosophy of the &quot;Two Handles&quot; likens the ruler to the tiger or leopard, which &quot;overpowers other animals by its sharp teeth and claws&quot; (rewards and punishments). Without them he is like any other man; his existence depends upon them. To &quot;avoid any possibility of usurpation by his ministers&quot;, power and the &quot;handles of the law&quot; must &quot;not be shared or divided&quot;, concentrating them in the ruler exclusively.

In practice, this means that the ruler must be isolated from his ministers. The elevation of ministers endangers the ruler, from whom he must be kept strictly apart. Punishment confirms his sovereignty; law eliminates anyone who oversteps his boundary, regardless of intention. Law &quot;aims at abolishing the selfish element in man and the maintenance of public order&quot;, making the people responsible for their actions.

Han Fei&#x27;s rare appeal, among Legalists, to the use of scholars (law and method specialists) makes him comparable to the Confucians, in that sense. The ruler cannot inspect all officials himself, and must rely on the decentralized (but faithful) application of &quot;fa&quot;. Contrary to Shen Buhai and his own rhetoric, Han Fei insists that loyal ministers (like Guan Zhong, Shang Yang, and Wu Qi) exist, and upon their elevation with maximum authority. Though Fa-Jia sought to enhance the power of the ruler, this scheme effectively neutralizes him, reducing his role to the maintenance of the system of reward and punishments, determined according to impartial methods and enacted by specialists expected to protect him through their usage thereof. Combining Shen Buhai&#x27;s methods with Shang Yang&#x27;s insurance mechanisms, Han Fei&#x27;s ruler simply employs anyone offering their services.

== Anti-Confucianism ==
While Shen Buhai and Shen Dao&#x27;s current may not have been hostile to Confucius, Shang Yang and Han Fei emphasize their rejection of past models as unverifiable if not useless (&quot;what was appropriate for the early kings is not appropriate for modern rulers&quot;). Han Fei argued that the age of Li had given way to the age of Fa, with natural order giving way to social order and finally political order. Together with that of Xun Kuang, their sense of human progress and reason guided the Qin dynasty.

Intending his Dao (way of government) to be both objective and publicly projectable, Han Fei argued that disastrous results would occur if the ruler acted on arbitrary, ad-hoc decision making, such as that based on relationships or morality which, as a product of reason, are &quot;particular and fallible&quot;. Li, or Confucian customs, and rule by example are also simply too ineffective. The ruler cannot act on a case-by-case basis, and so must establish an overarching system, acting through Fa (administrative methods or standards). Fa is not partial to the noble, does not exclude ministers, and does not discriminate against the common people.

Linking the &quot;public&quot; sphere with justice and objective standards, for Han Fei, the private and public had always opposed each other. Taking after Shang Yang he lists the Confucians among his &quot;five vermin&quot;, and calls the Confucian teaching on love and compassion for the people the &quot;stupid teaching&quot; and &quot;muddle-headed chatter&quot;, the emphasis on benevolence an &quot;aristocratic and elitist ideal&quot; demanding that &quot;all ordinary people of the time be like Confucius&#x27; disciples&quot;. Moreover, he dismisses it as impracticable, saying that &quot;In their settled knowledge, the literati are removed from the affairs of the state ... What can the ruler gain from their settled knowledge?&quot;, and points out that &quot;Confucianism&quot; is not a unified body of thought.

In opposition to Confucian family sentiment, Tao Jiang (2021) takes Han Fei&#x27;s analysis of family dynamics as based entirely on the position of the ruler, requiring structural solutions rather than Confucian education or moral cultivation. According to the Liji, an &quot;important early Confucian canon&quot;, penal laws should not be applied to high officials. As a major source of political corruption, ministers shielded family members from penal measures in the name of Humaneness and others moral justifications. Only those without connections are subject to the law. Although noting an opposition between politic and morality, Tao Jiang takes Han Fei&#x27;s opposition in this as clearly pointing to a moral dimension in his vision of political order. In what Tao Jiang takes as one of Han Fei&#x27;s &quot;most powerful condemnation of the gross injustice suffered by the commoners&quot;, Han Fei says:

==Comparisons and views==
Apart from the influence of Confucianist Xun Zi, who was his and Li Si&#x27;s teacher, because of the &quot;Han Feizi&quot;&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Daodejing&quot;, interpreted as a political text, the Han Feizi has sometimes been included as part of the syncretist Huang-Lao tradition, seeing the Tao as a natural law that everyone and everything was forced to follow, like a force of nature.

Being older than more recent scholarship, translator W. K. Liao (1960) described the world view of the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; as &quot;purely Taoistic&quot;, advocating a &quot;doctrine of inaction&quot; nonetheless followed by an &quot;insistence on the active application of the two handles to government&quot;, this being the &quot;difference between Han Fei Tzŭ&#x27;s ideas and the teachings of the orthodox Taoists (who advocated non-action from start to finish).&quot; Liao compares Han Fei&#x27;s thought to Shang Yang, &quot;directing his main attention... to the issues between ruler and minister... teaching the ruler how to maintain supremacy and why to weaken the minister.&quot;

 in his foreword to the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; praised Han Fei as a knowledgeable man with sharp, logical and firm arguments, supported by large amount of practical and realistic evidence. Han Fei&#x27;s strict methods were appropriate in a context of social decadence. Phan Ngọc claimed that Han Fei&#x27;s writings has three drawbacks, however: first, his idea of Legalism was unsuited to autocracy because a ruling dynasty will sooner or later deteriorate. Second, due to the inherent limitation of autocratic monarchy system, Han Fei did not manage to provide the solutions for all the issues that he pointed out. Third, Han Fei was wrong to think that human is inherently evil and only seeks fame and profit: there are humans who sacrificed their own profit for the greater good, including Han Fei himself. considered the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; to be superior to Machiavelli&#x27;s &quot;Prince&quot;, and claimed that Han Fei&#x27;s ideology was highly refined for its era.
Although considering the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; rich and erudite, Sinologist Chad Hansen does not consider Han Fei particularly original, philosophical or ethical&quot; and &quot;more polemical than reasoned&quot;, with unjustified assumptions and cynicism recognizable &quot;from all self-described realists&quot;, resting on the familiar sneering tone of superior realistic insight.&quot;

<text>Philippe, Baron de Rothschild (13 April 1902 – 20 January 1988) was a member of the Rothschild banking family who became a Grand Prix motor racing driver, a screenwriter and playwright, a theatrical producer, a film producer, a poet, and one of the most successful wine growers in the world.

== Early life ==
Born in Paris, Georges Philippe de Rothschild was the younger son of Baron Henri de Rothschild (1872–1947) (who was a noted playwright under the name André Pascal) and Mathilde Sophie Henriette von Weissweiller (1872–1926). At the outbreak of World War I, 12-year-old Philippe was sent to the safety of the family&#x27;s vineyard in the village of Pauillac in the Médoc. There, he developed a love of the country and the wine business, an enterprise in his family since 1853, but one his father and grandfather had shown little interest in. As a young man, in sharp contrast to the Rothschild family&#x27;s staid aristocratic traditions, Philippe de Rothschild became a larger-than-life figure.

== Car racing ==

During the 1920s, Philippe lived the life of a wealthy playboy, often found in the company of a beautiful woman, usually an actress, at one of the popular night spots in Paris. Philippe&#x27;s older brother had made friends with Robert Benoist when they served together in the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; during World War I and through this connection, for a short time Philippe took up Grand Prix motor racing. From his father, he inherited the love of fast cars, but wishing to maintain a low profile Philippe used the pseudonym &quot;Georges Philippe&quot; in order to race anonymously.

Rothschild raced his own Bugatti T35C with moderate success, including coming fourth in the 1929 Monaco Grand Prix. He also made a brief appearance for the elite Bugatti works team, but at the end of 1929 he abruptly withdrew from motorsport, to concentrate on the family wine-growing business.

Rothschild made his first competition appearance in the Paris–Nice auto race of 1928, competing in a borrowed Hispano-Suiza. After purchasing a supercharged Bugatti, the ex Targa Florio factory type 37A (37317) T37, he adopted the pseudonym to protect his family. &#x27;Georges Philippe&#x27; made his first appearance at the 1928 Bugatti Grand Prix at Le Mans, a race solely for private Bugatti owners where he became second immediately after the winner André Dubonnet.

For 1929, Rothschild decided to upgrade to a full Grand Prix-specification Type 35C. In fact, he was so enamoured with the vehicles, he ordered three. Using one of the new cars, &quot;Georges Philippe&quot; was entered into the Grand Prix d&#x27;Antibes. In a field that included René Dreyfus and Philippe Étancelin, both race winners many times over, Rothschild led the race until he crashed out on the 36th lap. A mere two weeks later, with the car rebuilt, Georges Philippe finished a highly creditable fourth at the inaugural Grand Prix Automobile de Monaco, behind winner William Grover-Williams.

Continued improvement was finally rewarded when Georges Philippe won the Burgundy Grand Prix three weeks later, finishing ahead of in a second Rothschild T35C. However, he was unfortunate to retire from the following race while running sixth. The third of Rothschild&#x27;s T35Cs was regularly campaigned by a rather curious acquaintance for a future Baron. A model and exotic dancer at the Casino de Paris, Helene Delangle regularly took to the track under her professional pseudonym &quot;Hellé Nice&quot;.

Nevertheless, Georges Philippe had attracted sufficient attention to be offered a factory drive alongside Monegasque star Louis Chiron. In his two races for the crack squad, Rothschild ran at the front of the field, before dropping back later in the race due to vehicle troubles. At the 1929 German Grand Prix, around the notorious Nürburgring Nordschleife, Georges Philippe was comfortably ahead of Chiron before contact with a wall caused damage to his Bugatti&#x27;s axle, slowing the car and allowing Chiron to pass and take the victory.

Unfortunately, increasing fame was wearing Georges Philippe&#x27;s anonymity rather thin. His final appearance was in the 1930 24 Hours of Le Mans where, driving an American Stutz, he failed to finish. After this Rothschild quietly laid &#x27;Georges Philippe&#x27; to rest, and returned to running Château Mouton Rothschild.

In 1935, Rothschild and his friend, Jean Rheims, who were sponsoring a bobsled team, refused to participate in the 1936 Winter Olympics at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, protesting what they called the &quot;persecution of Germans of Jewish religion.&quot;

== Wine grower ==
Despite the time spent racing automobiles and producing the 1932 film &quot;Lac aux dames&quot;, the first French &quot;talkie&quot; to gain international recognition (adapted from a novel by Vicki Baum and directed by Marc Allégret, it had a script by Colette and starred Jean-Pierre Aumont and Simone Simon), the energetic Philippe de Rothschild still devoted his energies and innovation to Château Mouton Rothschild in Pauillac.

He was only twenty years old when he took over the operations of the Château Mouton Rothschild vineyards and two years later, in 1924, came up with the unheard of idea of bottling the entire vintage at the Château, an idea that other producers of Premier Cru wines soon copied. Previously, vineyards sold their wines in bulk, leaving the maturing, bottling, labeling and marketing to be handled by the wine merchants. Philippe de Rothschild&#x27;s idea was to maintain control over the quality of his product and allow marketing of the brand name. Two years later, he developed a &quot;de facto&quot; price-fixing arrangement among other top Bordeaux producers.

Upon harvesting a crop he considered not up to the high standards of his vineyard, he chose not to sell that year&#x27;s vintage under the Château label. In 1932 Philippe de Rothschild began to sell this second-string vintage as a good low-cost Bordeaux under the name &quot;Mouton Cadet&quot;. The product became so successful that he eventually had to purchase grapes from vineyards throughout the Bordeaux region just to meet the demand. Today, Mouton Cadet is the number-one-selling red wine in the world.

In 1933 Philippe expanded the Mouton-Rothschild estates with the acquisition of the neighboring Château d&#x27;Armailhac. By the late 1930s, the wines of Mouton Rothschild were recognized as among the world&#x27;s best. Nonetheless, the Mouton vineyard was still rated as a &quot;Second Growth&quot; as a result of the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 (reputedly due to the vintner&#x27;s Anglo-Jewish heritage) and Philippe de Rothschild began a lifelong mission to change this judgment.
==Personal life==
In 1934, Philippe de Rothschild married Élisabeth Pelletier de Chambure (1902–1945), the former wife of Jonkheer , a Belgian nobleman. They had two children: Philippine Mathilde Camille de Rothschild (born 22 November 1933, died 23 August 2014) and Charles Henri de Rothschild (born and died 1938).

Rothschild&#x27;s late-in-life memoirs (&quot;Milady Vine&quot;, written in collaboration with his companion, the British theatre director Joan Littlewood) describe a partnership of great passion but also enormous tempestuousness and despair. The couple&#x27;s difficulties increased when their only son was born tragically deformed and died soon after birth. They eventually separated, and the baron&#x27;s wife reverted to her maiden name.

== World War II ==
The outbreak of World War II had serious consequences for the entire Rothschild family, who were Jewish. Following the German occupation of France, Philippe de Rothschild&#x27;s parents fled to the safety of Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Paris mansion where they had lived became the headquarters for the German Naval Command.

Although he was called up to serve in the French Air Force, the quick fall of France resulted in de Rothschild being arrested in Algeria by the Vichy government and the vineyard property seized. His French citizenship was revoked on 6 September 1940 for what &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;having left France without official permission or a valid reason.&quot; Released from Vichy custody on 20 April 1941, Philippe de Rothschild made his way to England, where he joined the Free French Forces of General Charles de Gaulle, earning a Croix de Guerre.

On his return to France following the Allies&#x27; liberation, Philippe de Rothschild learned that, although his daughter was safe, the Gestapo had, on charges of attempting to cross a line of demarcation with a forged permit, deported his estranged wife in 1941 to Ravensbrück concentration camp where she diedthe cause of her death remains unresolvedon 23 March 1945. Élisabeth Pelletier de Chambure was the only member of the Rothschilds to be murdered in The Holocaust.

== Postwar ==
Devastated, Rothschild had to deal with problems at his vineyard as well. The departing German army had done considerable damage to Chateau Mouton Rothschild. Together with dedicated employees, he put his energy into restoring the vineyard and by the early 1950s was once again producing wine.

At the same time, the multi-talented Rothschild returned to participation in the theatrical world, teaming up with Gaston Bonheur to write in both English and French the play &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;. Based on the D. H. Lawrence novel, their play was later made into a motion picture starring Danielle Darrieux. In 1952 Rothschild and Bonheur wrote the script for the film &quot;La Demoiselle et son revenant&quot;. Philippe de Rothschild was an accomplished poet and in 1952 his poem &quot;Vendange&quot; inspired Darius Milhaud to write a three-act ballet for the Paris Opera. He also translated Elizabethan poetry and the plays of Christopher Fry.

In 1954, Rothschild married a longtime mistress, Pauline Fairfax Potter (1908–1976), a Paris-born American who had been the head fashion designer at Hattie Carnegie. After their marriage, she used her aesthetic talents to help restore an old storage building on the estate, converting it into an opulent home, and became known as a tastemaker in the worlds of fashion and interior design.

In 1973, Château Mouton Rothschild became the only French vineyard to ever achieve reclassification to First Growth, thanks to decades of relentless lobbying. Subsequently, the owner of Château d&#x27;Yquem sued unsuccessfully to have the reclassification reversed as illegitimate. After his Mouton Rothschild lost to a California wine in the Judgment of Paris, he &quot;phoned one of the judges and asked haughtily, &#x27;What are you doing to my wines? It took me forty years to become classified as First Growth!&#x27;&quot;

Rothschild purchased Château Clerc Milon, a fifth-growth classified vineyard strategically located next to his own property. After achieving his lifelong goal with the 1973 upgrading of Chateau Mouton Rothschild to &quot;Premier Cru&quot; status, and after the historic results of the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, he began looking beyond France for wine-growing opportunities and in 1980 announced a joint venture with the respected American wine grower, Robert Mondavi, to form the Opus One Winery in Oakville, California.

In 1997, under the direction of Rothschild&#x27;s daughter Philippine, Château Mouton-Rothschild teamed up with Concha y Toro of Chile to produce a Cabernet Sauvignon based, Bordeaux-style red wine in a new winery built in Chile&#x27;s Maipo Valley, the Almaviva.

Baron Philippe de Rothschild remained active in the wine business until he died in 1988 at the age of 85, whereupon his daughter assumed control of the company. She has also had a successful career as a theatre actress under the stage name &quot;Philippine Pascal&quot;.

== Arts ==
As an offshoot of self-bottling, Philippe also came up with the idea of having his labels designed by famous artists. In 1946, this became a prominent and traditional part of the vineyard&#x27;s image, with labels created by great painters and sculptors such as Jean Cocteau, Leonor Fini, Henry Moore, Marie Laurencin, Georges Braque, Salvador Dalí, Jacques Villon, Pierre Alechinsky, Joan Miró, Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso, César, Jean-Paul Riopelle, Andy Warhol, and other notables.

In 1962 at Mouton the Rothschilds created the Museum of Wine in Art; here a collection of art works covering three millennia of wine is on display, including original art by Pablo Picasso and rare glassware.

== Literature ==
In 1978 &quot;Mercure de France&quot; published Philippe de Rothschild&#x27;s &quot;Le Pressoir perdu: poèmes&quot;. In 1981 Presses de la Cité published his &quot;Vivre la vigne: du ghetto de Francfort à Mouton Rothschild 1744-1981&quot;.

<text>Free probability is a mathematical theory that studies non-commutative random variables. The &quot;freeness&quot; or free independence property is the analogue of the classical notion of independence, and it is connected with free products.
This theory was initiated by Dan Voiculescu around 1986 in order to attack the free group factors isomorphism problem, an important unsolved problem in the theory of operator algebras. Given a free group on some number of generators, we can consider the von Neumann algebra generated by the group algebra, which is a type II1 factor. The isomorphism problem asks whether these are isomorphic for different numbers of generators. It is not even known if any two free group factors are isomorphic. This is similar to Tarski&#x27;s free group problem, which asks whether two different non-abelian finitely generated free groups have the same elementary theory.

Later connections to random matrix theory, combinatorics, representations of symmetric groups, large deviations, quantum information theory and other theories were established. Free probability is currently undergoing active research.

Typically the random variables lie in a unital algebra &quot;A&quot; such as a C*-algebra or a von Neumann algebra. The algebra comes equipped with a noncommutative expectation, a linear functional φ: &quot;A&quot; → C such that φ(1) = 1. Unital subalgebras &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;m&quot; are then said to be freely independent if the expectation of the product &quot;a&quot;1...&quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; is zero whenever each &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; has zero expectation, lies in an &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;, no adjacent &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;&#x27;s come from the same subalgebra &quot;A&quot;&quot;k&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; is nonzero. Random variables are freely independent if they generate freely independent unital subalgebras.

One of the goals of free probability (still unaccomplished) was to construct new invariants of von Neumann algebras and free dimension is regarded as a reasonable candidate for such an invariant. The main tool used for the construction of free dimension is free entropy.

The relation of free probability with random matrices is a key reason for the wide use of free probability in other subjects. Voiculescu introduced the concept of freeness around 1983 in an operator algebraic context; at the beginning there was no relation at all with random matrices. This connection was only revealed later in 1991 by Voiculescu; he was motivated by the fact that the limit distribution which he found in his free central limit theorem had appeared before in Wigner&#x27;s semi-circle law in the random matrix context.

The free cumulant functional (introduced by Roland Speicher) plays a major role in the theory. It is related to the lattice of noncrossing partitions of the set { 1, ..., &quot;n&quot; } in the same way in which the classic cumulant functional is related to the lattice of &quot;all&quot; partitions of that set.

<text>Omnibus Press is a publisher of music-related books. It publishes around 30 new titles a year to add to a backlist of over 300 titles currently in print.

== History ==
Omnibus Press was launched in 1972 as a general non-fiction publisher to complement the sheet music published and distributed by its parent company Music Sales Group. Music Sales had launched a separate company called Book Sales Ltd and the earliest Book Sales catalogue, issued in the early 70s, included compilations of underground comic strips, art and photography titles and one of the earliest books on the then newly discovered art of video.

After former &quot;Melody Maker&quot; music journalist Chris Charlesworth joined as Omnibus editor in 1983, it was decided to concentrate exclusively on music books, and among its earliest acquisitions was Rock Family Trees by music archivist Pete Frame which remains in print and have been the basis of two BBC TV series. Over the succeeding decades Omnibus has published many biographies on most of rock musicians. These include &quot;Morrissey &amp; Marr: The Severed Alliance&quot; by Johnny Rogan, &quot;Dear Boy: The Life of Keith Moon&quot; by Tony Fletcher, &quot;Uptight: The Velvet Underground Story&quot; by Victor Bockris and &quot;Catch A Fire: The Life of Bob Marley&quot; by Timothy White.

Among the rock and pop writers whose work has been published by Omnibus over the years are Richard Williams, Chris Welch, Peter Dogget, Patrick Humphries, David Sinclair and Everett True (UK) and Dave Marsh, Paul Williams, Nelson George, Jerry Hopkins, David Ritz and Danny Sugerman (US).

Wise Music Group has published The Beatles&#x27; printed sheet music since the company&#x27;s inception, and this association is reflected in the many Beatles-related books that Omnibus has published. These include &quot;The Beatles: A Diary&quot; by Barry Miles, a Beatles insider from the early days, &quot;With The Beatles: The Historic Photos of Dezo Hoffman&quot;, and &quot;The Songwriting Secrets of The Beatles&quot; by Dominic Pedlar, an analytical study of their music. In 2007, Omnibus published Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia of Popular Music (Concise Edition)&quot;. At 1,600 pages, this is the abridged version of Larkin&#x27;s 10-volume encyclopedia, a biographical listing of rock, pop and jazz artists.

In 2006, Music Sales acquired Sanctuary Books which added a significant number of additional music books to the Omnibus list, as well as a number of sports, travel and novelty &amp; gift books.

In February 2020, parent company Wise Music Group changed its name from The Music Sales Group.

<text>Briton Ferry () is a town and community in the county borough of Neath Port Talbot, Wales. The Welsh name may indicate that the church, &quot;llan&quot;, is protected from the wind, &quot;awel&quot;. Alternatively, &quot;Sawel&quot; may be a derivative of Saul, St Paul&#x27;s earlier name, who, supposedly, once landed at Briton Ferry. An alternative Welsh name unused today is &quot;Rhyd y Brython&quot;, a direct translation of Briton Ferry. The Normans referred to the River crossing as &quot;La Brittonne&quot; and &quot;Leland&quot; in 1540 &quot;as Britanne Fery.&quot;

== Background ==
Briton Ferry is on the mouth of the River Neath, where it enters Swansea Bay, and is the first river crossing along the Roman road that follows the coastline along that part of South Wales. A milestone dedicated to Victorinus, a former Roman Governor in Gaul and Britain, was found at nearby Baglan. The ferry boat crossing was some from the bridge across the River Neath at Neath. At certain low tides, it was possible to walk across the river via a ford close to the ferry route using stepping stones.

Briton Ferry lies on the heavily fractured ground near the mouth of the River Neath on a line between the upper and middle coal measures. The original course of the River Neath may have been through the Jersey Marine gap between the isolated hills, which formed a rocky ridge between Briton Ferry and Jersey Marine. Beyond the ridge, the sands of Baglan Bay extended into Briton Ferry until the mid-nineteenth century when the estuary’s saltings were developed for industry. Today, the river crossing comprises two bridge crossings which carry the M4 motorway and A483 road across the river.

There are remains of ancient Iron Age hill forts on the hills around Briton Ferry, they are named Buarth-y-Gaer and Gaer Fawr, and situated on Mynydd-y-Gaer alongside the boundary with Baglan. A Neolithic stone is in place within the grounds of Cwrt Sart school. A plaque alongside the stone is inscribed, &quot;When removed, it will speak but once to reveal its secret, and then remain silent forever.&quot; One explanation for the name of the nearby Giant&#x27;s Grave is the presence of a cromlech. At Crymlyn Burrows, an unlooped Bronze Age axe (c.1400 BC) was discovered.

The town was part of the Briton Ferry Estate, whose lands belonged to Margam Abbey before they passed on, in turn, to the Mansel, Villiers, and Vernon families (Earls of Jersey). It had been owned by the Price family of Briton Ferry in the early 17th century until the Mansels inherited it. There it remained until Louisa Barbara Mansell married George Venables Vernon in 1757. There was no male issue, so she left the estate to her godson George, Earl of Jersey. He modernised and reduced the size of the estate to ensure its viability.

==Industrial development==

=== Early industrialisation ===
As early as the 1660s, primitive forges existed at Briton Ferry, later using local coal from small pits such as Price&#x27;s Drift, but Briton Ferry&#x27;s marine location stimulated its industrial development. In 1840, an area of about of land in Cwmafan was leased for 99 years to John Vigurs and subsequently passed to Wright, Butler &amp; Co. Ltd, then to Baldwins Ltd. The terraces of houses built on this land were sublet in 1897 and 1898 for the remainder of the term of this lease, but many were declared unfit for habitation in the 1930s and demolished. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, coastal shipping at Giant&#x27;s Grave&#x27;s wharves loaded coal for export from pits in the Neath Valley via Neath Canal and unloaded iron ore and limestone. The canal was completed in 1797, becoming the second in Glamorgan, running 14 miles (22.53 km) from Abernant to Briton Ferry. 1841 Neath Abbey Iron Co laid plans for an ironwork on the east bank of the river at Warren Hill. With the development of railways in the second half of the 19th century, Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Briton Ferry Dock to handle coal and other goods for the Vale of Neath Railway. It opened in 1861 following the town&#x27;s ironworks in 1846 and the Red Jacket and Briton Ferry Copperworks on the West Bank of the river in 1849 and 1853. The 1860s saw the start of tinplate manufacturing from puddled iron until steel-making started in the town at the end of the 19th century.

=== Later industrialisation ===
Further industrialisation brought factories such as the Vernon, Gwalia, Wern, Baglan Bay Tinplate, and Whitford Sheet Works, receiving their raw material from the Albion and Briton Ferry Steelworks. Taylor&#x27;s Foundry, Baglan Engineering and Thos. W. Ward serviced these industries. They were built on land close to the River Neath and the South Wales Railway built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The industrial development attracted other railways, including the Neath and Brecon Railway, the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway, and the South Wales Mineral Railway with its cable-powered incline.

==Briton Ferry floating dock==

In the 1850s, the Briton Ferry Floating Dock Company was incorporated and bought land from the Earl of Jersey to build the Briton Ferry Docks. When it opened in 1861, the dock consisted of an outer tidal basin which had round-ended jetties at its mouth and quays along its sides and an inner floating dock of 5.3 hectares, enclosed by masonry walls and sandstone. The water level was maintained by a single gate, which included a buoyancy chamber. It covered an area of . The gate was wide, and the unique structure with its floating caisson was designed by Brunel&#x27;s father, Sir Marc Brunel. Following Brunel&#x27;s death in 1859, Robert Brereton took over as engineer and also acted as engineer for improvements made in 1872 and 1873.

The company went bankrupt and the Great Western Railway took over the docks until they were closed in 1959. The inner basin has been largely built upon.

In 2000, the dock walls and lock gate were Grade 2 listed for their industrial and archaeological interest as the major surviving built component of Brunel&#x27;s docks. The dock is a scheduled Ancient Monument.

As part of a regeneration programme instigated by Briton Ferry Brunel Dock Trust in 2005 to preserve, restore and maintain the heritage of Brunel&#x27;s historic site and its structures for public benefit, a tower, which formed part of the complex, was refurbished. It was an accumulator tower for the hydraulic system, which operated the dock gate and cranes. The system was designed by William Armstrong, and in 2010, the Institution of Civil Engineers unveiled a plaque at the site to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth. The outer basin has potential use by fishing boats and yachts.

The ship-breaking of WW2 ships, such as &quot;HMS Bermuda&quot;, took place at Giant&#x27;s Grave upstream of the floating dock, and north of the M4 and A48 crossings. Huw Pudner and Chris Hastings, two local songwriters, wrote &quot;Giants Grave&quot;, a song about the ship-breaking industry in Briton Ferry which was featured in the film &quot;The History of Briton Ferry&quot; by Jason May.

The wharves at Briton Ferry are run by Neath Port Authority, the most important of which are Giant&#x27;s Wharf, which handles steel, scrap, coke, coal and machine parts, and Ironworks Wharf, which handles minerals such as sand and cement. They offer tidal and river berths with a maximum depth of . Between them, 200 vessels a year are handled.

==The Mouchel phenomenon==
In 1875, the French-born engineer Louis Gustave Mouchel established himself in Briton Ferry and quickly became involved in several successful enterprises. His consultancy company was directly responsible for introducing ferroconcrete (also called reinforced concrete) to Britain. In neighbouring Swansea, a building constructed for Weaver and Co mills claimed to be the first entirely ferroconcrete building in the United Kingdom.

So important was Briton Ferry for trade with France that Mouchel was, from 1879 to his death, French Consular Agent to Briton Ferry, Talbot, Porthcawl and Neath Abbey.

== Housing ==
Most housing in the 19th century was built by local private builders, sometimes for local industry or the railways. This can be seen at Giant’s Grave, Warren Hill, and near the dock. Municipal housing in Briton Ferry started as a result of the Housing of the Workers Act 1890 and continued as a result of 20th-century housing legislation just before and following World War II. High-rise housing was attempted in the 1950s due to a shortage of building land, but it was not a success. In the late 20th century the high-rise housing and much of the earliest housing near the docks was demolished and replaced by more municipal housing. As a participant in the Swansea Bay City Deal, Neath-Port Talbot Council aims for a share in the project to future-proof at least 10,300 properties over five years by making low carbon, energy-efficient homes, with 7,000 retro-fitted to existing houses and 3,300 newly built.

==De-industrialisation==

A consortium of steel and tinplate producers consolidated all tinplate mills to create the Steel Company of Wales in 1947. By 1953, only the Albion Steelworks remained in the town, all other tinplate production having ceased.

The Albion Steelworks, which had used oil to fuel its largest open-hearth furnace, closed in November 1978 and was demolished within a year. This was followed by the closure of the ship-breaker and steel supplier Thos. W. Ward in 1983. The firm at Giant&#x27;s Grave, which operated from 1906 until 1979, broke up 197 merchant ships and 94 Admiralty.

The steel and tinplate industry&#x27;s demise in the second half of the twentieth century was followed in the first two decades by closures of other local firms that had employed many from Briton Ferry. BP Chemicals opened its plant at nearby Baglan Bay in 1963, quickly expanding into one of the biggest petrochemical sites in Europe; by 1974 it was employing 2500 staff. The advent of North Sea oil proved injurious since its location meant it was on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of Britain to receive oil supplies from the North Sea. This situation, along with a further decline in demand for its products, gradually reduced the size of the plant, and in 2004 it closed entirely. BP&#x27;s oil refinery at Llandarcy closed four years later. The Metal Box Company&#x27;s closure was announced in 2015, and its premises were bought by Neath-Port Talbot Council in 2017.
The industrial revolution brought much expansion to Briton Ferry, including ironworks, steelworks, tinplate production and engineering. Production generally lasted until the 1970s. In 1951, as the industry began to dwindle, portions of the estate were sold to the Principality Property Co., Estateways Builders, John Oliver Watkins, the City &amp; Provincial Housing Association, and Gwalia Land &amp; Property Developments Ltd.

==Modern development==
The economic transformation of the area in the second half of the last century resulted in few original industries surviving in the town, though new industries have been created in Neath-Port Talbot&#x27;s adjacent communities of Baglan, Jersey Marine and Melyncryddan. Intertissue, a paper converter new to Baglan Energy Park, employs a workforce of 447. The park has the potential to create and accommodate 7,000 jobs over the next 25 years. £15 million has been invested in a solar energy farm on the park. Baglan Energy Park&#x27;s on-site power generation provides competitively priced electricity to businesses within the area using a combined-cycle gas turbine power plant. In Jersey Marine, Amazon opened its distribution warehouse in 2008.

== Government and politics ==
Briton Ferry had its Urban District Council from 1895 to 1922, when it formed part of Aberavon Parliamentary Constituency. The growth of the town&#x27;s metals industries at that time was accompanied by the growth of independent working-class representation and strong socialist, internationalist, and pacifist traditions. Prominent Independent Labour Party representatives were Councillor Joe Branch, Ivor O. Thomas and Ivor H. Thomas, the founder of the South Wales branch of the National Council for Civil Liberties. Branch was the first chair of the constituency Labour Party. Ramsay MacDonald was associated with the tradition and represented the town as MP within the Aberavon constituency. He became the leader of the opposition in 1922 and became Prime Minister in 1924. His constituency office was at Chequers in Briton Ferry. Many speakers visited the town at that time, including Bertrand Russell, Norman Angell, Keir Hardie, Ernest Bevin, Thomas Mann, E. D. Morel, Charlotte Despard, Emmeline, and Sylvia Pankhurst. For mainly political reasons, thirty-seven of the town&#x27;s residents were imprisoned during World War I for opposing conscription. Along with seventy objectors from Aberavon and district, these communities provided the country&#x27;s strongest opposition to the war, despite the town&#x27;s loss of 120 soldiers&#x27; lives during World War I. The town had the distinction of providing Parliament with four MPs during 1955: Dai L. Mort, Ivor O. Thomas, Raymond Gower and Ronald Rees.

The town is currently in the parliamentary constituency of Aberafan Maesteg, having been in Neath constituency from 1945 until 1983. The current MP is Stephen Kinnock, while the current Senedd Member is David Rees along with four regional members for South Wales West. The town encompasses the electoral wards of Briton Ferry East and Briton Ferry West. Today, the Town Council consists of twelve members and meets monthly in the Council Chamber at the Community Resource Centre, the community-managed library.

== Transport ==

=== Trains ===
The railway was important in the town&#x27;s industrial development town, and much of the core rail infrastructure remains. The town is served by the Briton Ferry railway station, which is now accessed from Shelone Road. It is near the Cwrt Sart junction, where the Swansea District Line meets the South Wales Main Line. For passenger services, Briton Ferry is served by two principal operators. The first, Transport for Wales, runs regional trains to Swansea and West Wales and also to Cardiff and Manchester via the Welsh Marches line. In contrast, First Great Western trains from Swansea to London do not stop here. The typical service pattern has been one train approximately every two hours in each direction, but Transport for Wales, which took over the Wales and Borders franchise in October 2018, intends to operate further services.

=== Buses ===
The town is served by twelve local services and three express services which pickup from various stops within the town. The local buses are operated by First Cymru and cater for local shoppers, colleges and hospitals in the Neath-Port Talbot area, while the express services are provided to reach Bridgend, Maesteg and Swansea.

=== Roads ===
The M4 and the A483 bypass the town to relieve the traffic on the A474, a former Roman road, which runs through the town parallel to the main railway line and connects Neath with Port Talbot.

==== First road crossing ====

Construction of the first river bridge crossing took place from 1949–1955 and was one of the first large-scale road bridges to be constructed in Britain after World War II as part of the A48 Neath bypass road scheme. It comprises two viaducts. The western viaduct crosses the River Neath, and the eastern viaduct crosses the former dock area of Briton Ferry and the South Wales main railway line.

==== Second road crossing ====
The second road crossing was completed in 1994 to carry the London to Wales M4 motorway across the River Neath to supersede the A48. Briton Ferry has junction J42, which is from the motorway&#x27;s eastern end and from its western at Pont Abraham. It filled the final gap in the motorway between Newport and west Wales, Its completion presented formidable problems, with extensive industrial and commercial development, estuarine flood-lands and the navigable River Neath all lying in the path of possible routes.

== Landmarks, attractions and recreation ==

John Mills&#x27;s sculpture at the southern end of the town, &quot;The Crossing&quot;, symbolises the town&#x27;s industrial and maritime history through the importance of its bridges and river crossing.

Jersey Park has been an exceptionally well-preserved, urban public park since its opening in 1925, the land having been gifted originally by the Earl of Jersey in 1908. Its original layout of formal and informal areas remains complete and includes sports facilities. Planting in the park is diverse and interesting, with an emphasis on evergreen trees and shrubs. The park is designated Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

Rhoddfa Clarke is the name of the inclined part of the South Wales Mineral Railway, the lowest, level part of which now forms Jersey Park. Here rope-hauled coal wagons delivered coal from Glyncorrwg to Briton Ferry dock. Above the dense matrix of streets and busy roads of Briton Ferry, the park and incline give access to Craig y Darren Woods and offers some respite from the town&#x27;s traffic. This ancient woodland is crisscrossed by a network of footpaths offering congenial walks with dramatic views of the town and Swansea Bay.

<doc id="679709" wikidata="Q769909" url="?curid=679709" title="Nonlinear programming">
<text>In mathematics, nonlinear programming (NLP) is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints are not linear equalities or the objective function is not a linear function. An optimization problem is one of calculation of the extrema (maxima, minima or stationary points) of an objective function over a set of unknown real variables and conditional to the satisfaction of a system of equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints. It is the sub-field of mathematical optimization that deals with problems that are not linear.

== Definition and discussion ==

Let &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;p&quot; be positive integers. Let &quot;X&quot; be a subset of &quot;Rn&quot; (usually a box-constrained one), let &quot;f&quot;, &quot;gi&quot;, and &quot;hj&quot; be real-valued functions on &quot;X&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; in {&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;m&quot;} and each &quot;j&quot; in {&quot;1&quot;, ..., &quot;p&quot;}, with at least one of &quot;f&quot;, &quot;gi&quot;, and &quot;hj&quot; being nonlinear.

A nonlinear programming problem is an optimization problem of the form

:formula_1

Depending on the constraint set, there are several possibilities:

* &quot;feasible&quot; problem is one for which there exists at least one set of values for the choice variables satisfying all the constraints.
* an &quot;infeasible&quot; problem is one for which no set of values for the choice variables satisfies all the constraints. That is, the constraints are mutually contradictory, and no solution exists; the feasible set is the empty set.
* &quot;unbounded&quot; problem is a feasible problem for which the objective function can be made to be better than any given finite value. Thus there is no optimal solution, because there is always a feasible solution that gives a better objective function value than does any given proposed solution.

Most realistic applications feature feasible problems, with infeasible or unbounded problems seen as a failure of an underlying model. In some cases, infeasible problems are handled by minimizing a sum of feasibility violations.

Some special cases of nonlinear programming have specialized solution methods:

* If the objective function is concave (maximization problem), or convex (minimization problem) and the constraint set is convex, then the program is called convex and general methods from convex optimization can be used in most cases.
* If the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear, quadratic programming techniques are used.
* If the objective function is a ratio of a concave and a convex function (in the maximization case) and the constraints are convex, then the problem can be transformed to a convex optimization problem using fractional programming techniques.

==Applicability==

A typical non-convex problem is that of optimizing transportation costs by selection from a set of transportation methods, one or more of which exhibit economies of scale, with various connectivities and capacity constraints. An example would be petroleum product transport given a selection or combination of pipeline, rail tanker, road tanker, river barge, or coastal tankship. Owing to economic batch size the cost functions may have discontinuities in addition to smooth changes.

In experimental science, some simple data analysis (such as fitting a spectrum with a sum of peaks of known location and shape but unknown magnitude) can be done with linear methods, but in general these problems are also nonlinear. Typically, one has a theoretical model of the system under study with variable parameters in it and a model the experiment or experiments, which may also have unknown parameters. One tries to find a best fit numerically. In this case one often wants a measure of the precision of the result, as well as the best fit itself.

== Methods for solving a general nonlinear program ==

=== Analytic methods ===
Under differentiability and constraint qualifications, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions provide necessary conditions for a solution to be optimal. If some of the functions are non-differentiable, subdifferential versions of Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions are available.

Under convexity, the KKT conditions are sufficient for a global optimum. Without convexity, these conditions are sufficient only for a local optimum. In some cases, the number of local optima is small, and one can find all of them analytically and find the one for which the objective value is smallest.

=== Numeric methods ===
In most realistic cases, it is very hard to solve the KKT conditions analytically, and so the problems are solved using numerical methods. These methods are iterative: they start with an initial point, and then proceed to points that are supposed to be closer to the optimal point, using some update rule. There are three kinds of update rules:

* Zero-order routines - use only the values of the objective function and constraint functions at the current point;
* First-order routines - use also the values of the &quot;gradients&quot; of these functions;
* Second-order routines - use also the values of the &quot;Hessians&quot; of these functions.

Third-order routines (and higher) are theoretically possible, but not used in practice, due to the higher computational load and little theoretical benefit.

=== Branch and bound ===
Another method involves the use of branch and bound techniques, where the program is divided into subclasses to be solved with convex (minimization problem) or linear approximations that form a lower bound on the overall cost within the subdivision. With subsequent divisions, at some point an actual solution will be obtained whose cost is equal to the best lower bound obtained for any of the approximate solutions. This solution is optimal, although possibly not unique. The algorithm may also be stopped early, with the assurance that the best possible solution is within a tolerance from the best point found; such points are called ε-optimal. Terminating to ε-optimal points is typically necessary to ensure finite termination. This is especially useful for large, difficult problems and problems with uncertain costs or values where the uncertainty can be estimated with an appropriate reliability estimation.

==Implementations==

There exist numerous nonlinear programming solvers, including open source:

* ALGLIB (C++, C#, Java, Python API) implements several first-order and derivative-free nonlinear programming solvers
* NLopt (C/C++ implementation, with numerous interfaces including Julia, Python, R, MATLAB/Octave), includes various nonlinear programming solvers
* SciPy (de facto standard for scientific Python) has scipy.optimize solver, which includes several nonlinear programming algorithms (zero-order, first order and second order ones).
* IPOPT (C++ implementation, with numerous interfaces including C, Fortran, Java, AMPL, R, Python, etc.) is an interior point method solver (zero-order, and optionally first order and second order derivatives).

<text>Green Cargo AB is a Swedish state-owned logistics company that transports various types of goods by train. It was created on 1 January 2001 out of the logistics division of Swedish State Railways (SJ). While organised as a public limited company, it is wholly owned by the Swedish government. As of 2019, it was responsible for almost 80% of Swedish rail freight transport. 

==Activities==
While Green Cargo has traditionally been oriented towards serving the Swedish market, via partnerships with other rail freight companies, international freight trains in the European market are also operated. In January 2022, Green Cargo announced that it was restructuring its international operations to simplify operations, reduce costs, and reduce transit times. Changes included the subcontracting of its &quot;Denmark Direct&quot; service to DB Cargo Scandinavia for increased capacity, while the &quot;Italy Direct&quot; and &quot;Austria Direct&quot; services were rerouted to run via Denmark instead of traditional train ferries. Various Swedish industries have made use of Green Cargo&#x27;s services, such as the car manufacturer Volvo, which has routinely had goods trains run from Sweden to its production plant at Gent, Belgium. During 2020, these services were adjusted by Green Cargo in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to instead focus on the transporting of food productions on behalf of the grocery chain ICA Gruppen.

The vast majority of Green Cargo&#x27;s trains are hauled using electric locomotives; by 2023, the company was operating roughly 400 freight trains per day while 96 percent of tonne kilometrage was being achieved via electric traction, minimising its climate impact. Its definition of sustainable development is the long-term outcome of six target areas: finance, quality, security, employees, the environment and society. Since 2006, the company&#x27;s sustainability reports have been reviewed by external auditors with similar scrutiny as financial data.

Various efforts to improve the company&#x27;s financial standing have been conducted since its creation; a restructuring programme launched in 2015 pursued a more effective production model that reportedly increased the average train&#x27;s fill rate by 15 percent. New practices have included &quot;backloading&quot;, reducing empty return trips after delivering one customer&#x27;s cargo by identifying and carrying goods from another on that return journey. Green Cargo has spoken out on the impact of track access charges on its business and the wider rail sector. Operations prior to the mid 2010s had typically been unprofitable, however, an operating profit of SEK 200m (€20.5m) was recorded between 2013 and 2016. Various other initiatives to incorporate new technologies and computer-based systems have also been undertaken by the operator, such as the development of a simplified and more stable computer platform for its operations and increasing the flexibility of its operations, particularly in terms of fleet and capacity management.

==Rolling stock==
Green Cargo operates 370 locomotives of various types along with 5,250 wagons. A traditional staple of the company&#x27;s fleet has been the SJ Rc series of electric locomotives; during the late 2000s, 42 Class Rc2 locomotives underwent refurbishment by the multinational rolling stock manufacturer Bombardier Transportation, to reflect the upgrades applied, they were redesignated as Class Rd2 locomotives. In the 2010s, Green Cargo has operated at least 16 Bombardier Traxx locomotives, locally referred to as &quot;Re&quot;, some of which were leased from the European rolling stock hire company Alpha Trains. Another new locomotive class has been the Romanian-built Softronic Transmontana, designated &quot;Mb&quot; by Green Cargo; the first pair of MB electric locomotives were ordered in July 2017; by 2022, Green Cargo had 16 such locomotives in its fleet.

Various modification programmes aimed at improving the performance of its rolling stock have been conducted. By the 2010s, locomotive engines were being continuously upgraded, such as with the addition of start-stop systems to reduce unnecessary emissions and noise pollution. During 2018, Green Cargo started using XXXL containers on its trains, allowing for larger payloads to be carried. In the winter of 2020/2021, Green Cargo commenced a trial of digital automatic couplings on its rolling stock to automate several time-intensive and hazardous tasks in forming its trains; the company stated that the technology would improve capacity, safety margins, operational efficiency, punctuality, and profitability.

<text>Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu () is a music college in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It was created in 1837 with the name &quot;Liceo Filo-dramático de Montesión&quot;.

In 1847 the institution inaugurated the opera house Gran Teatre del Liceu. In 1854, the Liceo Filarmónico and the Gran Teatre del Liceu separated administratively. Nevertheless, both entities have always remained closely linked.

Among its students have been, among other, artists as: singers Francisco Viñas, Maria Barrientos, Josefina Huguet, Conchita Supervía, Mercedes Capsir, Elvira de Hidalgo, Miguel Fleta, Victoria de los Ángeles, Jaume Aragall, Montserrat Caballé, Manuel Ausensi, José Carreras, Eduard Giménez, Dalmacio González, Juan Pons, Nuria Rial, Josep Bros; guitarist Renata Tarragó; pianist Frank Marshall or composers Leonardo Balada, Lluís Benejam, Agusti Grau Joan Guinjoan, Joan Lamote de Grignon, Ricard Lamote de Grignon, Frederic Mompou, Carles Santos, Manuel Valls, and Joaquim Zamacois. Many of them also became professors there upon completion of their studies, including Renata Tarragó. Among the professors there were Catalan composers Enric Morera, Graciano Tarragó and German composer Engelbert Humperdinck. The Barcelona Guitar Orchestra is based there.

Since 1999 Maria Serrat i Martín has assumed the General Direction and in 2002 the Spanish composer and musicologist Benet Casablancas assumed the academic direction of the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu.

<text>Glynneath ( ; also spelt &quot;Glyn-neath&quot; and &quot;Glyn Neath&quot;) is a town, community and electoral ward lying on the River Neath in the county borough of Neath Port Talbot, Wales. It was formerly in the historic county of Glamorgan. Glynneath ward covers only part of the community, with some 840 electors included in the neighbouring ward of Blaengwrach.

Industrialisation reached Glynneath when coal mining started in 1793, and rapidly expanded when the Neath Canal came to the town in 1775. Many features of the old canal still survive to the present time.

There are waterfalls to the north east at Pontneddfechan near the Brecon Beacons and large parts of the rural area are heavily forested.

==Notable buildings and structures==
Glynneath is home to the ruins of Aberpergwm House. Once owned by Rhys ap Siancyn, Aberpergwm House became the home of the Williams family, Welsh gentry with a strong tradition of using the Welsh language over English. Their descendants include the last of the Welsh household bards Dafydd Nicolas and folksong collector Maria Jane Williams. The Williams&#x27; family motto &quot;y ddioddefws y orfu&quot; (He who suffers, triumphs) was adopted by Glamorgan County Council. The mansion itself was remodelled in 1876 but is now derelict and little of note remains of the building.

St. Cadoc&#x27;s Church, in the grounds of Aberpergwm House, was built as a chapel in the 17th century, rebuilt in 1808-1809 for the Aberpergwm Williams family and extended in 1836–41. It is a Grade II* listed building.

Rheola House, a Regency house designed c.1812 by the eminent architect John Nash, is also Grade II* listed.

Glynneath Town Hall is a regularly used civic building situated at Heathfield Avenue. It is owned and managed by Glynneath Town Council.

The Grade II* listed Bethania Community Centre on the High Street is an example of an early Calvinistic Methodist chapel with well detailed external frontage in contrasting stone and iron work railings. The interior has good examples of very finely detailed woodwork.

A bronze statue of the singer Max Boyce, who was born in the town, was erected in the High Street, in September 2023, in recognition of Boyce&#x27;s 80th birthday.

== Sports and leisure ==
Glynneath used to host one of motor sport&#x27;s most important challenges, the British round of the World Rally Championship (formerly known as the Lombard RAC rally or Rally GB). Some of the biggest names in motor sport have taken part and have failed to complete the British round.

Glynneath also has an association with downhill mountain biking with the Welsh National Championships being held at Rheola.

Glynneath is home to Glynneath RFC, a rugby union club founded in 1889.

Glynneath also boasts an active group of football clubs and a well attended tennis club. Until recently, Glynneath Bowls Club, in particular the Ladies&#x27; Bowls Club was an active group. 

Glynneath Leisure Centre, maintained through Celtic Leisure is situated just off of Chain Road.

==Notable residents==
* The Anchoress, musician, was born in the town.
* Max Boyce, comedian and singer, closely linked to Welsh rugby culture.
* Julie Gardner, television producer, responsible for the successful relaunch of Doctor Who.
* Leslie Hardman, British Army chaplain and rabbi, who was among the liberators of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, was born in the town.
* Ruth Madoc, actress, best known for her role as Gladys Pugh in the television sitcom &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;
* Siwan Morris, actress, who has appeared in the television series &quot;Belonging&quot;, &quot;Caerdydd&quot;, and &quot;Skins&quot;.

<text>The Belgium national football team has represented Belgium in men&#x27;s international football since their maiden match in 1904. The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA and is governed in Europe by UEFA—both of which were co-founded by the Belgian team&#x27;s supervising body, the Royal Belgian Football Association. Periods of regular Belgian representation at the highest international level, from 1920 to 1938, from 1980 to 2002 and again from 2014 onwards, have alternated with mostly unsuccessful qualification rounds. Most of Belgium&#x27;s home matches are played at the King Baudouin Stadium in Brussels.

Belgium&#x27;s national team have participated in three quadrennial major football competitions. It appeared in the end stages of fourteen FIFA World Cups and six UEFA European Championships, and featured at three Olympic football tournaments, including the 1920 Summer Olympic which they won. Other notable performances are victories over four reigning world champions—West Germany, Brazil, Argentina and France—between 1954 and 2002. Belgium has long-standing football rivalries with its Dutch and French counterparts, having played both teams nearly every year from 1905 to 1967. The squad has been known as the Red Devils since 1906; its fan club is named &quot;1895&quot;.

During the national player career of forward Paul Van Himst, the most-praised Belgian footballer of the 20th century, Belgium finished in third place as hosts at UEFA Euro 1972. After that, they experienced two golden ages with many gifted players. In the first period, which lasted from the 1980s to the early 1990s, the team finished as runners-up at UEFA Euro 1980 and fourth in the 1986 FIFA World Cup. In the second, under guidance of Marc Wilmots and later Roberto Martínez in the 2010s, Belgium topped the FIFA World Ranking for the first time in November 2015 and finished third at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. To date, Belgium is the only national team in the world to top the FIFA ranking without having won a World Cup or a continental trophy.

==History==

===Early history===
Belgium was one of the first mainland European countries to play association football, with the earliest recorded example of its practice in Belgium dating back to 1863.

On 11 October 1900, Beerschot AC honorary president Jorge Díaz announced that Antwerp would host a series of challenge matches between Europe&#x27;s best football teams. After some organisational problems, on 28 April 1901, Beerschot&#x27;s pitch hosted its first tournament, in which a Belgian selection and a Dutch team made up of players from third-level sides led by ex-footballer Cees van Hasselt contested the Coupe Vanden Abeele. Naturally, the hosts had little trouble claiming the cup, defeating the Netherlands by 8–0. Belgium then beat the Netherlands in all three follow-up matches; FIFA does not recognize these results because Belgium fielded some English players, such as Herbert Potts, who scored 12 of &quot;Belgium&#x27;s&quot; 17 goals.

On 1 May 1904, the Belgians played their first official match, against France at the Stade du Vivier d&#x27;Oie in Uccle; their draw left the Évence Coppée Trophy unclaimed. Twenty days later, the football boards of both countries were among the seven FIFA founders. At that time, the Belgian squad was chosen by a committee chaired by Édouard de Laveleye, who usually drew from the country&#x27;s six or seven major clubs. Belgium would play twice a year against the Netherlands beginning from 1905 onwards, generally once in Antwerp and once in Rotterdam. From these beginnings until 1925, Belgian-Dutch cup trophies would be awarded in the &quot;Low Countries derby&quot;.

In 1906, the national team players received the nickname Red Devils because of their red jerseys, and four years later, Scottish ex-footballer William Maxwell replaced the UBSSA committee as their manager. From 1912, UBSSA governed football only and was renamed UBSFA. During the Great War, the national team only played unrecognized friendlies, with matches in and against France.

===Olympic gold and World Cup struggles===

At the 1920 Summer Olympic, in their first official Olympics appearance, the &quot;Red Devils&quot; won the gold medal on home soil after a controversial final in which their Czechoslovak opponents left the pitch. In the three 1920s Summer Olympic, they achieved fair results (four wins in seven matches), and played their first intercontinental match, against Argentina.

However, over the following decade, Belgium lost all of their matches at the first three FIFA World Cup final tournament. According to historian Richard Henshaw, &quot;[t]he growth of [football] in Scandinavia, Central Europe, and South America left Belgium far behind&quot;. Although World War II hindered international football events in the 1940s, the Belgian team remained active with unofficial matches against squads of other allied nations.

Belgium qualified for only one of eight major tournament during the 1950s and the 1960s: the 1954 World Cup. The day before the tournament began, the RBFA was among the three UEFA founders. Dutch journalists considered the draw of the 1954 Belgian team in their opener against England to be the most surprising result of that match day, even more than Switzerland&#x27;s victory over the Italian &quot;football stars&quot;. However, Belgium were eliminated after a loss to Italy in the second (and last) group match. Two bright spots in these decades were wins against World Cup holders: West Germany in 1954, and Brazil in 1963. Between these, Belgium defeated Hungary&#x27;s Golden Team in 1956. The combination of failure in competitive matches, and success in exhibition matches, gave the Belgians the mock title of &quot;world champions of the friendlies&quot;.

The team&#x27;s performance improved during the early 1970s, under manager Raymond Goethals. Fully dressed in white, as the White Devils, Belgium had their first victories at World and European Championship at the 1970 World Cup and Euro 1972. En route to that Euro appearance, their first, they eliminated reigning European champions Italy by winning the two-legged quarter-final on aggregate. At the end stage, they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary. In 1973, the denial of a match-winning goal in their last 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification match for UEFA Group 3 cost Belgium their appearance at the final, causing Belgium to become the only nation ever to miss a World Cup final round despite not allowing a goal during the qualifiers. The next two attempts to reach a major final (Euro 1976 and the 1978 FIFA World Cup) were also fruitless.

===Golden age===
Beginning with a second-place finish at Euro 1980, the 1980s and the early 1990s are generally considered as Belgium&#x27;s first golden age. Coached by Guy Thys, they achieved their spot in the 1980 final with an unbeaten record in the group phase; in the final, they narrowly lost the title to West Germany with the score 1–2. Starting with the 1982 World Cup, and ending with the 2002 World Cup, the national team qualified for six consecutive World Cup end stages and mostly progressed to the second round. During this period, managers Guy Thys, Paul Van Himst and Robert Waseige each guided a Belgian selection past the first round. In addition to receiving individual FIFA recognitions, the team reached the semi-finals of the 1986 World Cup after eliminating the Sovjet Union and Spain in the knock-out stage. Argentina went through to the final after a 2–0 victory, in which their star player Diego Maradona scored both goals.

After reaching the Euro 1980 final, they were unsuccessful at subsequent European Championship, with early exits from their appearances in 1984 and in 2000. During the late 1990s, they played three friendly tournament in Morocco, Cyprus and Japan, sharing the 1999 Kirin Cup with Peru in the latter. The greatest talents of the Belgian team during this golden age were retired from international football by 2000. At the eve of the World Cup in 2002, Belgium defeated reigning world and European champions France. During that World Cup, Belgium defeated Russia and tied with co-host Japan and Tunisia to reach the round of 16. There they were eliminated by eventual world champions Brazil. Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari would later state that their match against Belgium was the most difficult of the tournament.

After the 2002 World Cup, the team weakened with the loss of more veterans and coach Waseige. They missed out five successive major finals from UEFA Euro 2004 until UEFA Euro 2012, and went through an equal number of head coaches. A 2005 win over reigning European champions Greece meant nothing but a small comfort. In between, a promising new generation was maturing at the 2007 European U-21 Championship; Belgium&#x27;s squad qualified for the following year&#x27;s Summer Olympic in Beijing, where the Young Red Devils squad finished fourth. Seventeen of them appeared in the senior national team, albeit without making an immediate impact. Belgium finished in second (and last) place at the Kirin Cup in May 2009, and lost against the 125th FIFA-ranked Armenian team in September 2009. After Georges Leekens&#x27; second stint as national manager, his assistant Marc Wilmots became the caretaker in May 2012.

===Second golden age===
After two matches as interim coach, Wilmots agreed to replace Leekens as manager. Following his appointment, the team&#x27;s results improved, such that some foreign media regarded it as another Belgian golden generation. The young Belgian squad qualified as unbeaten group winners for the 2014 World Cup final, and earned Belgium&#x27;s second-ever place in a World Cup quarter-finals with a four-match winning streak.

Belgium qualified for UEFA Euro 2016 with a match to spare in October 2015, and took the top spot in the FIFA World Ranking for the first time in November 2015, to stay first for five months. In the following year, Belgium could not confirm their role as outsider at the European Championship with a quarter-finals elimination by the 26th FIFA-ranked Welsh team. This prompted the RBFA to dismiss Wilmots. In the 2018 World Cup qualifying allocation, they were seeded first in their group, and made the final tournament under Spanish manager Roberto Martínez, becoming the first European team besides hosts Russia to do so. At the World Cup, Belgium won all their group matches, against Panama, Tunisia and England, which meant they went to the knockout stage as group winners. In the 1/8 finals they were 0-2 behind against Japan, but eventually won by making it 3–2 in the 94th minute. The Red Devils also won their match against Brazil 2–1 in the 1/4 finals. Belgium was eliminated in the semi-finals by eventual champions France, but won the third place play-off against England. On 16 November 2019, for the first time in its history the team topped the World Football Elo Ratings, after a 1–4 away win over Russia during the Euro 2020 qualifiers.

Despite the impressive form in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifiers as well as being regarded as the biggest contender for the European trophy, the tournament became a complete disappointment for Belgium. Being drawn in Group B alongside Russia, Denmark and Finland, Belgium easily conquered the group with three wins. In the knockout phase, Belgium first faced reigning champions Portugal in the last sixteen and survived the scare with a thunder strike from Thorgan Hazard to give Belgium a 1–0 win. In the quarter-finals, Belgium once again faced old foe Italy, but Belgium failed to take revenge for their 2016 loss, once again suffering a 1–2 defeat, with the goal being scored by Romelu Lukaku, ending Belgium&#x27;s campaign on a sad note.

At the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Belgium were drawn into Group F alongside Croatia, Morocco and Canada. Despite starting their campaign well with a 1–0 victory over Canada, they then suffered a shock 2–0 defeat to Morocco, and following a 0–0 draw with Croatia in their final group game, Belgium were knocked out of the tournament at the group stages for the first time since 1998. Following their elimination from the tournament, Martínez announced that he would be standing down as head coach after six years in charge of the national team.

In February 2023, it was announced that Domenico Tedesco has been appointed as the new head coach of the Belgian national team, replacing Roberto Martinez on a contract lasting until the end of Euro 2024. At the finals, Belgium were eliminated in the round of 16, losing 1–0 to France.

==Team image==
===Kits===


In home matches, the team&#x27;s outfield players traditionally wear the colours of the Belgian flag: black, yellow and red. Red dominates the strip and is often the sole jersey colour. The away colours are usually white, black or both; in 2014, the squad introduced a third, yellow kit. Their shirts are often trimmed with &quot;tricolores&quot; at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem has been the national team&#x27;s badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield, similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms. On 8 November 2019, the Royal Belgian Football Association revealed a new logo, which preserved the main elements of the previous one: the royal crown, the wreath and the Belgian tricolor.

For their first unofficial match in 1901, the Belgian team wore white jerseys with tricoloured bands on the upper arms. Around their third unofficial match in 1902, the choice was made for a &quot;shirt with national colours ... [that would indicate,] with a stripe, the number of times every player has participated in an encounter&quot;. Since 1904, Belgium&#x27;s classic all-red jersey design has been altered twice. In 1904–05, the squad briefly wore satin shirts with three horizontal bands in red, yellow and black; according to sports journalist Victor Boin, the shirts set &quot;the ugliness record&quot;. During the 1970s, manager Raymond Goethals chose an all-white combination to improve the team&#x27;s visibility during evening matches.

Six clothing manufacturers have supplied the official team strip. Adidas is the producer since 2014, and closed a sponsorship deal with the RBFA until 2026; it was also the supplier from 1974 to 1980, and from 1982 to 1991. Former kit manufacturers are Umbro (early 1970s), Admiral (1981–1982), Diadora (1992–1999), Nike (1999–2010) and Burrda (2010–2014).

===Media coverage===
The first live coverage of a Belgian sporting event occurred on 3 May 1931, when journalist Gust De Muynck commentated on the football match between Belgium and the Netherlands on radio. Later, football broadcasts were also televised. As 60 per cent of Belgians speak Dutch and 40 per cent French, commentaries for the national team matches are provided in both languages. The matches are not broadcast in German—Belgium&#x27;s third official language. During Belgium&#x27;s tournament appearances in the 1980s and the early 1990s, Rik De Saedeleer crowned himself the nation&#x27;s most famous football commentator with his emotional and humorous reports.

Initially the matches were transmitted mainly on public television channels: the former BRTN (now VRT) in Dutch, and the RTBF in French. Since 1994, commercial channels such as vtm and its sister channel Kanaal 2, and VIER in Flanders, have purchased broadcasting rights. The Euro 2016 round-of-16 match against Hungary was the most-watched programme in Belgian television history, with an audience of over four million viewers out of 11.3 million Belgian citizens.

In April 2014, the VRT started transmitting a nine-piece, behind-the-scenes documentary about the national team filmed during the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, titled &quot;Iedereen Duivel&quot; (&quot;Everybody Devil&quot;). Cable broadband provider Telenet broadcast an eight-part documentary about individual players titled &quot;Rode Helden&quot; (&quot;Red Heroes&quot;).

===Side activities===

Multiple events were organised for the fans during the squad&#x27;s peak popularity in the 2010s. During the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, a string of interactive events called the &quot;Devil Challenges&quot; were organised. The premise was that small groups of international players would do a favour in return for each of the five comprehensive chores their supporters completed (&quot;colour Belgium red&quot;, &quot;gather 500,000 decibels&quot;, etc.), all of which were accomplished. In June 2013, the Belgian national team&#x27;s first ever Fan Day attracted over 20,000 supporters; a second was held after the 2014 World Cup. On the days of Belgium&#x27;s 2014 World Cup group matches, large dance events titled &quot;Dance with the Devils&quot; took place in three Belgian cities. This type of happening was repeated during Belgium&#x27;s Euro 2016 group matches.

Occasionally, the Belgian team directly supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 they played at least five unofficial matches of which the returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D&#x27;Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican industrial city of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign on the shoulders of their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.

In the 21st century, several national team players acted up against discrimination. In 2002, the national squad held its first anti-racism campaign in which they posed with slogans. A home Euro 2012 qualifier was given the theme of respect for diversity in 2010; this UEFA-supported action was part of the European FARE Action Week. Ex-Red Devil Dimitri Mbuyu—the first black Belgium player (in 1987)—was engaged as godfather, and other foreign, current, and former footballers who played in the Belgian top division participated. In 2018, four national team players spoke up against homophobic violence, in a video clip made by organisation Kick It Out.

===Nickname, logo and mascot===

After a 1905 match, a Dutch reporter wrote that three Belgian footballers &quot;work[ed] as devils&quot;. A year later Léopold FC manager Pierre Walckiers nicknamed the players Red Devils, inspired by their jersey colour, and the achievement of three successive victories in 1906. Because of their white home shirts in the 1970s, they were temporarily known as the White Devils. Since 2012, the team logo is a red trident (or three-pronged pitchfork), an item that is often associated with the devil. Apart from that, the national squad has also had four official anthropomorphous mascots. The first was a lion in team kit named Diabolix, a reference to the central symbol in the Belgian coat of arms that appeared on the team jerseys from 1905 to 1980. In accordance with their epithet, the next mascots were a red super-devil and two fan-made modern devils; the one introduced in 2018 was named &quot;Red&quot;. A trident logo, referring to a devil, is also used frequently.

===Supporters===
Fans of the Belgian national team display the country&#x27;s tricolour national flag, usually with an emphasis on the red element. In 2012, local supporter clubs merged into one large Belgian federation named &quot;1895&quot; after the foundation year of the RBFA. One year later, 1895 had 24,000 members. The nationwide interest in the football squad has also been reflected by the occasional presence of Belgian monarchs at their matches since 1914. One of the greatest moments for the Belgian team and their 12th man was in mid-1986 when the Belgian delegation at the Mexico World Cup received a warm &quot;welcome home&quot;. When the World Cup semi-finalists appeared on the balcony of Brussels Town Hall, the adjoining Grand Place square was filled with an ecstatic crowd that cheered as though their squad had won a major tournament.

The team&#x27;s deterioration after the 2002 World Cup lead to their absence from the end stages of the next five major tournament, and strained their popularity. Between 2004 and 2010, local journalists called the Belgian footballing nation &quot;mortally ill&quot;. Of the fans that kept supporting their squad in bad times, Ludo Rollenberg was one of the most loyal. He attended the team&#x27;s matches worldwide since 1990, missing only the 1999 Japanese Kirin Cup and two other matches by 2006, and was the only supporter to attend their matches in Armenia in 2009.

Just before the kick-off of a 2014 World Cup home qualifier, Belgium&#x27;s footballers saw a first tifo banner, sized depicting a devil in the national colours. The presence of many Belgian players in top leagues abroad, such as the Premier League, and promising results under Marc Wilmots, increased fans&#x27; enthusiasm and belief in a successful World Cup campaign. Because of this popularity peak, two Belgian monuments were decorated in national colours for the 2014 FIFA World Cup event; the Manneken Pis statue received a child-sized version of the new Belgian uniform, and facets of the Atomium&#x27;s upper sphere were covered in black, yellow and red vinyl.

===Rivalries===
Belgium&#x27;s main football rivals are its neighbors the Netherlands and France, with which it shares close cultural and political relations. The matchup between the Belgian and Dutch team is known as the Low Countries derby, they have played each other in 126 official matches. Belgium won the first four—unofficial—matches against the Netherlands, but lost their first FIFA-recognised contest. The two national teams played each other biannually between 1905 and 1964, except during the World Wars. They have met 18 times in major tournament campaigns, and have played at least 35 friendly cup matches: in Belgium for the &quot;Coupe Vanden Abeele&quot;, and in the Netherlands for the &quot;Rotterdamsch Nieuwsblad-Beker&quot;. The overall balance favours the Netherlands, with 55 wins against 41 Belgian victories. The Low Countries&#x27; squads co-operated in fundraising initiatives between 1925 and 1941; they played five unofficial matches for charity, FIFA and the Belgian Olympic Committee.

The clash between the Belgian and French sides is nicknamed &quot;le Match Sympathique&quot; in French (&quot;the Friendly Match&quot;); they have contested 74 official matches . The first match between Belgium and France, the &quot;Évence Coppée&quot; Trophy played in 1904, was the first official match for both teams and the first official football match between independent countries on the European continent. Until 1967, the sides met almost annually. As of September 2020, Belgium have the better record, with 30 wins to France&#x27;s 25, and France has played most often against Belgium in international football.

==Stadium==

Numerous former and current venues in 11 urban areas have hosted Belgium&#x27;s home matches. Most of these matches have been played in Brussels on the Heysel/Heizel Plateau, on the site of the present-day King Baudouin Stadium—a multipurpose facility with a seating capacity of 50,122. Its field also hosts the team&#x27;s final trainings before domestic matches. Since 2007, most physical preparation takes place at the National Football Centre in Tubize, or at Anderlecht&#x27;s training ground in the Neerpede quarter. Apart from Belgian home friendlies, at the international level Belgium&#x27;s national stadium has also hosted six European Championship matches.

In 1930, for the country&#x27;s centennial, the venue was inaugurated as the Jubilee Stadium with an unofficial match between Belgium and the Netherlands. At that time, the stadium had a capacity of 75,000. In 1946, it was renamed Heysel Stadium after its city quarter. This new name became associated with the tragedy preceding the 1985 European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool; 39 spectators died after riots in the then antiquated building. Three years after the disaster, plans were unveiled for a renovation; in 1995, after two years of work, the modernised stadium was named after the late King Baudouin. In May 2013, the Brussels-Capital Region announced that the King Baudouin Stadium would be replaced by Eurostadium, elsewhere on the Heysel Plateau; in 2018, however, the plans for the new stadium were cancelled definitively.

==Results and fixtures==
, the complete official match record of the Belgian national team comprises 847 matches: 374 wins, 178 draws and 295 losses. During these matches, the team scored 1,516 times and conceded 1,315 goals. Belgium&#x27;s highest winning margin is nine goals, which has been achieved on four occasions: against Zambia in 1994 (9–0), twice against San Marino in 2001 (10–1) and 2019 (9–0), and against Gibraltar in 2017 (9–0). Their longest winning streak is 12 wins, and their highest unbeaten record is 23 consecutive official matches.

The following is a list of match results in the last twelve months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.

===Coaching history===
Since 1904, the RBFA, 25 permanent managers and two caretaker managers have officially been in charge of the national team; this includes one national footballer selector. , a crew of over 30 RBFA employees guides the player group, including German-Italian head coach Domenico Tedesco, and assistant coaches Andreas Hinkel and Luke Benstead. Under Marc Wilmots, Belgium reached the top FIFA ranking spot in 2015, which earned him the title of Best Coach of the Year at the 2015 Globe Soccer Awards. Under Guy Thys, the squad achieved record results at World and European Championship; &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine accordingly proclaimed him Manager of the Year in 1986. Under Spanish coach Roberto Martínez, the team reached a best-ever third place finish at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Rather than developing innovative team formations or styles of play, Belgium&#x27;s managers applied conventional tactics. At the three 1930s World Cups, the Red Devils were aligned in a contemporary 2–3–5 &quot;pyramid&quot;. In 1954, Doug Livingstone&#x27;s squad played in a 3–2–5 &quot;WM&quot; arrangement during World Cup matches. Throughout most of their tournament matches in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, the team played in a 4–4–2 formation. Since Raymond Goethals&#x27; stint in the 1970s, a key strength of the Belgian squad has been their systematic use of the offside trap, a defensive tactic that was already intensively applied in the 1960s by Anderlecht coach Pierre Sinibaldi. According to football journalist Wim De Bock, &quot;master tactician&quot; Goethals represented the &quot;conservative, defensive football of the Belgian national team&quot;; he added that in the 1970s, the contrast between the Belgian playing style and the Total Football of their Dutch rivals &quot;could not be bigger&quot;.

In an attempt to win a match at the 1998 World Cup, Georges Leekens chose a 4–3–3 arrangement for Belgium&#x27;s second and third group matches. Robert Waseige, Belgium coach around 2000, said that &quot;above all, [his] 4–4–2 system [was] holy&quot;, in the sense that he left good attackers on the bench to keep his favourite formation. Wilmots opted for the 4–3–3 line-up again, with the intention of showing dominant football against any country.

==Players==
===Current squad===
On 8 November 2024, the following 23 players were named in the squad for the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League matches against Italy and Israel on 14 and 17 November 2024, respectively. Three days later, Charles De Ketelaere, Jérémy Doku, Malick Fofana and Joaquin Seys all dropped out due to injury or not being fully fit, with Samuel Mbangula, Albert Sambi Lokonga, Killian Sardella and Arthur Vermeeren called up to replace them. After the match against Italy, five players dropped out due to injury or not being fully fit: De Cuyper, Lavia, Lukaku, Onana and Theate. Norman Bassette was the only replacement player called-up.

===Notable===

Between 1904 and 1980, mainly attacking Belgium players were recognised as talented footballers. In the team&#x27;s first decade, striker Robert De Veen was very productive with 26 goals in 23 international appearances. Richard Henshaw described Alphonse Six as &quot;Belgium&#x27;s greatest player in the prewar period ... [who] was often called the most skillful forward outside Great Britain&quot;. The key player of the victorious 1920 Olympic squad was Robert Coppée, who scored a hat-trick against Spain&#x27;s Ricardo Zamora, and the penalty in the final. Other outstanding Belgian strikers in the interwar period were former top scorer Bernard Voorhoof and &quot;Belgium&#x27;s football grandmaster&quot; Raymond Braine, considered &quot;one of the greatest players of the era&quot;.

Gifted players in the 1940s and the 1950s included centre-back Louis Carré and attackers Jef Mermans, Pol Anoul and Rik Coppens; at the 1954 World Cup, Anoul shone with three goals, and newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; named Coppens the event&#x27;s best centre forward. The 1960s and the early 1970s were the glory days of forward and four-time Belgian Golden Shoe Paul Van Himst, later elected Belgian UEFA Golden Player of 1954–2003 and Belgium&#x27;s Player of the Century by IFFHS. At the 1965 Ballon d&#x27;Or, Van Himst ranked fourth, achieving Belgium&#x27;s highest ever position at the European football election. Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football, a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them &quot;Who [from both of you] was the best, actually?&quot;. Coppens replied: &quot;I will ask Paul that ... If Paul says it was me, then he&#x27;s right&quot;. In 1966, striker Raoul Lambert and defending midfielder Wilfried Van Moer joined the national team; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972, Van Moer won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst&#x27;s fourth rank at the 1980 Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Belgium has seen two talented waves since 1980, from which several players in defensive positions gained international fame. In the 1980s and the early 1990s, goalkeepers Jean-Marie Pfaff and Michel Preud&#x27;homme were elected best custodians at FIFA World Cups, while FIFA recognised midfielders Jan Ceulemans and Enzo Scifo as the propelling forces of Belgium&#x27;s 1986 FIFA World Cup squad. In 2002, after all players of this generation had retired, Marc Wilmots became Belgium&#x27;s top scorer at the World Cup with five goals.

During the 10 years from 2002 to 2012 in which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournament, another golden generation matured, many of whom gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign European top clubs and competitions. These include defender Vincent Kompany, midfielder Kevin De Bruyne who is one of the best attacking midfielders in the world and his generation; and winger Eden Hazard, who has been praised as one of Chelsea F.C.&#x27;s greatest players ever and one of his era&#x27;s best footballers in the world, in the team, he is ranked only after Romelu Lukaku on Belgium&#x27;s all-time scoring leaderboard. Honorable mentions of this golden generation are Thibaut Courtois, Jan Vertonghen, Dries Mertens, and Toby Alderweireld. These players helped Belgium finish at the third place of 2018 FIFA World Cup, the team&#x27;s best result at the tournament and reach number one on FIFA ranking twice, since 2015.

==Individual statistics==
===Most capped players===

, the RBFA lists 725 players who appeared on the men&#x27;s senior national team. With 157 caps according to the RBFA, Jan Vertonghen has the most appearances for Belgium. Eden Hazard started the most matches as captain (59). Hector Goetinck had the longest career as an international footballer: 17 years, 6 months and 10 days.

. &quot;The records are collected based on data from FIFA and RSSSF. Statistics include three matches that are unrecognised by FIFA.&quot;

===Top goalscorers===

Romelu Lukaku is the highest-scoring Belgium player with 85 goals. Those who scored the most goals in one match are Robert De Veen, Bert De Cleyn and Josip Weber with five; Lukaku holds the record for the most hat-tricks with four. Belgium&#x27;s fastest goal after the initial kick-off was scored by Christian Benteke, 8.1 seconds into a match against Gibraltar on 10 October 2016.

==Competitive record==
===FIFA World Cup===

Belgium failed to progress past the first round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout matches in the 1934 and 1938 editions—but only enough to save their honours. In 1954, they drew with England (4–4 after extra time), and in 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against El Salvador (3–0).

From 1982 until 2002, Belgium qualified for six successive World Cup, and in the tournament finals they advanced beyond the first round five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a Polish hat-trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0–1 loss against the Soviet Union.

At Mexico 1986, the Belgian team achieved their then best-ever World Cup run at the time. In the knockout phase as underdogs they beat the Soviets after extra time (3–4); the unnoticed offside position of Jan Ceulemans, during the initial ninety minutes, allowed him to equalise (2–2) and force the match into extra time. They also beat Spain, in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 draw, but lost to eventual champions Argentina in the semi-finals 2–0, and France in the third-place match (4–2).

In the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Belgium dominated periods of their second-round match against England; Enzo Scifo and Jan Ceulemans hit the woodwork. David Platt&#x27;s volley in the final minute of extra time, described as &quot;nearly blind&quot; by Richard Witzig, avoided an apparently goalless draw and led to the sudden elimination of the Belgians.

In 1994, a 3–2 defeat to defending champions Germany saw Belgium go out in the second round again. Afterwards, the entire Belgian delegation criticised referee Kurt Röthlisberger for not awarding a penalty for a foul on Belgian Josip Weber. Three draws in the group stage of the 1998 World Cup were insufficient for Belgium to reach the knockout stage. With two draws, the 2002 FIFA World Cup started poorly for Belgium, but they won the decisive group match against Russia 3–2. In the second round, they faced eventual World Cup winners Brazil; Belgium lost 2–0 after Marc Wilmots&#x27; headed opening goal was disallowed due to a &quot;phantom foul&quot; on Roque Júnior, as Witzig named it.

In 2014, Belgium beat all their group opponents with a single-goal difference. Thereafter, they played an entertaining round of 16 match against the United States, in which American goalkeeper Tim Howard made 15 saves. However, they defeated the United States 2–1 in extra time. In a balanced quarter-finals, Argentina eliminated Belgium, after a 1–0 victory.

At the 2018 World Cup, Belgium started with five consecutive victories (including group wins over Panama, Tunisia and England). In the fourth, in the round of 16 match against Japan, they suffered a major setback in the second half by being led 0–2. However, Japan, which displayed a very open and offensive game, did not withdraw sufficiently in defense and left a lot of opportunities to Belgium who turned the tide and eventually won (3–2) with goals from Jan Vertonghen and late substitutes Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli. Belgium then defeated World Cup favourites Brazil 2–1 on the back of an early Fernandinho own goal and a goal by Kevin De Bruyne, and reached the semi-finals. Belgium lost to France 0–1 in the semi-finals, as France displays a style of play opposite to that of Japan by basing themselves above all on a rigorous defense, the possession left to the adversary and fast counter-attacks (which aroused criticisms from certain Belgian players on the French style of play); but rebounded to win 2–0 in their second victory over England in the tournament to secure third place and the best ever World Cup result for the Belgian national team. Some players that notably contributed were captain Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Romelu Lukaku, who were later recognised by FIFA as the tournament second best player (Silver Ball), best goalkeeper (Golden Glove) and third top scorer (Bronze Boot), respectively.

===UEFA European Championship===

With only seven successful qualification campaigns out of seventeen, Belgium&#x27;s performance in the European Championship does not compare to their World Cup record, yet it holds the highest record compare to their World Cup performance. Belgium has hosted or co-hosted the event twice; they were chosen to accommodate the UEFA Euro 1972 from three candidates, and hosted UEFA Euro 2000 with the Netherlands.

At Euro 1972, Belgium finished third after losing 1–2 against West Germany and beating Hungary 2–1. The team&#x27;s best continental result is their second place at Euro 1980 in Italy. By finishing as group winners, Belgium reached the final, to face West Germany. The West German Horst Hrubesch scored first, but René Vandereycken equalised courtesy of a penalty. Two minutes before the regular playing time ended, Hrubesch scored again denying Belgium a first European titles.

At Euro 1984, in their last and decisive group match against Denmark, the Belgian team took a 0–2 lead, but the Danes won the match 3–2. Sixteen years later, Belgium automatically reappeared at UEFA&#x27;s national team tournament as co-hosts. After winning the Euro 2000 opener against Sweden 2–1, two 2–0 losses against eventual runners-up Italy and Turkey eliminated the Belgians from the tournament by the end of the group stage.

In spite of winning with broad margins against the Republic of Ireland (3–0) and Hungary (0–4) at Euro 2016, Belgium exited in the quarter-finals. As during the tournament qualifiers, Wales defeated Belgium. This time by 3–1.
===UEFA Nations League===
===Olympic Games===

Football tournament for senior men&#x27;s national teams took place in six Summer Olympic between 1908 and 1936. The Belgian squad participated in all three Football at the Summer Olympic in the 1920s and kept the gold medal at home at the 1920 edition. Apart from the proper national team, two other Belgian delegations appeared at the Olympic. At the 1900 Summer Olympic, a Belgian representation with mainly students won bronze, and at the 2008 edition, Belgium&#x27;s U-23 selection placed fourth.

Belgium&#x27;s 1920 Olympic squad was given a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In the first half of the finals against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée converted a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the dismissal of the Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.

<text>The 24 Hours of Daytona, also known as the Rolex 24 At Daytona for sponsorship reasons, is a 24-hour sports car endurance race held annually at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. It is run on the Sports Car Course layout, a combined road course that uses most of the tri-oval plus an infield road course. Held on the last weekend of January or first weekend of February as part of Speedweeks, it is the first major automobile race of the year in North America. The race is sanctioned by IMSA and is the first race of the season for the IMSA SportsCar Championship.

The race has borne the names of several sponsors over the years. Since 1992, the Rolex Watch Company has been the title sponsor of the race, replacing Sunbank, which replaced Pepsi in 1984. Winning drivers of all classes receive a Rolex Daytona watch.

The race is known as a leg of the informal Triple Crown of endurance racing along with the 24 Hours of Le Mans and 12 Hours of Sebring.

==Beginnings==
Shortly after the track opened, on April 5, 1959, a six-hour/1000 kilometer USAC-FIA sports car race was held on the road course. Count Antonio Von Dory and Roberto Mieres won the race in a Porsche, shortened to due to darkness. The race used a 3.81-mile layout, running counter-clockwise. This event is not considered to be part of the lineage of the eventual 24-hour race.

In 1962, a 3-hour sports car race was introduced. Known as the Daytona Continental, it counted towards the FIA&#x27;s new International Championship for GT Manufacturers. The first Continental was won by Dan Gurney, driving a 2.7L Coventry Climax-powered Lotus 19. Gurney was a factory Porsche driver at the time, but the 1600-cc Porsche 718 was considered too small and slow for what amounted to a sprint race on a very fast course.
In the past, a car had to cross the finish line after 24 hours to be classified, which led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line for hours, then restarted their engines and crawled across the finish line one last time in order to finish after the 24 hours and be listed with a finishing distance, rather than dismissed with DNF (did not finish). This was the case in the initial 1962 Daytona Continental (then 3 hours), in which Dan Gurney&#x27;s Lotus 19 had established a lengthy lead when the engine failed with just minutes remaining. Gurney stopped the car at the top of the banking, just short of the finish line. When the three hours had elapsed, Gurney simply cranked the steering wheel to the left (toward the bottom of the banking) and let gravity pull the car across the line, to not only salvage a finishing position, but actually win the race. This led to the international rule requiring a car to cross the line under its own power in order to be classified.

In 1964, the event was expanded to , doubling the classic 1000 km distance of races at Nürburgring, Spa and Monza. The distance amounted to roughly half of the distance the 24 Hours of Le Mans winners covered at the time, and was similar in length to the 12 Hours of Sebring, which was also held in Florida in March. Starting in 1966, the Daytona race was extended to the same 24-hour length as Le Mans.

==24-hour history==
The first 24 Hour event in 1966 was won by Ken Miles and Lloyd Ruby driving a Ford Mk. II. &quot;Motor Sport&quot; reported: &quot;For their first 24-hour race the basic organization was good, but the various officials in many cases were out of touch, childish and lacked the professional touch which one now finds at Watkins Glen.&quot;

1966 also saw Suzy Dietrich enter the 24 Hours event, driving a Sunbeam Alpine with Janet Guthrie and Donna Mae Mims. The trio finished 32nd and, along with another women&#x27;s team in the race, became the first women&#x27;s teams to finish an international-standard 24-hour race.

After having lost in 1966 at Daytona, Sebring and Le Mans to the Fords, the Ferrari P series prototypes staged a 1–2–3 side-by-side parade finish at the banked finish line in 1967. The Ferrari 365 GTB/4 road car was given the unofficial name &quot;Ferrari Daytona&quot; in celebration of this victory.

Porsche repeated this show in their 1–2–3 win in the 1968 24 Hours. After the car of Gerhard Mitter had a big crash caused by tire failure in the banking, his teammate Rolf Stommelen supported the car of Vic Elford and Jochen Neerpasch. When the car of the longtime leaders Jo Siffert and Hans Herrmann dropped to second due to a technical problem, these two also joined the new leaders while continuing with their car. So Porsche managed to put 5 of 8 drivers on the center of the podium, plus Jo Schlesser and Joe Buzzetta finishing in third place, with only Mitter being left out.

Lola finished 1–2 in the 1969 24 Hours of Daytona. The winning car was the Penske Lola T70-Chevrolet of Mark Donohue and Chuck Parsons. Few spectators witnessed the achievement as &quot;Motor Sport&quot; reported: &quot;The Daytona 24-Hour race draws a very small crowd, as can be seen from the empty stands in the background.&quot;

1970 saw the race with drivers strapped into their cars, and at the start, drove away. Since 1971, races begin with rolling starts.

In 1972, because of an FIA rule, the race was shortened to six hours, while the energy crisis led to the cancellation altogether in 1974. The Sports Car Club of America sanctioning was replaced by the International Motor Sports Association in 1975.

In 1982 the race continued on as part of the IMSA GT Championship instead of WSC.

In 2014, the race saw a dramatic crash involving Memo Gidley who was driving the pole-sitter DP and Matteo Malucelli, an amateur driver in a Ferrari 458 of the GTD category that has never won a race in North American Endurance. At the time of the impact, Malucelli was driving at less than 30 mph and keeping on the track while cars were passing him at 150 mph. Memo, who was side by side to another car couldn&#x27;t have seen him and impacted front first. The race was subsequently red-flagged. Both drivers survived.

The regular teams were expanded to three drivers in the 1970s. Nowadays, four drivers compete typically because of the longer night driving. In the professional-based DPi Prototype and ACO GTE classes, all four drivers are usually professionals. In the ACO LMP2 and SRO Group GT3-based classes, many of these additional drivers are known as &quot;amateur drivers,&quot; under current FIA specifications. Amateur drivers are sportsman drivers that have built a career in a non-motorsport related occupation. These type of drivers are typically eligible for IMSA&#x27;s Jim Trueman and Bob Akin awards, awarded to the top driver who is not a professional at the end of season. These amateur drivers or overage professional drivers (FIA Silver or Bronze are typically for amateur drivers but professional drivers over 55 are automatically classified at this level) are required in the car for a specific number of hours. Most often, the fourth driver in all classes is a Daytona-only professional driver of renown that most often has won a major professional championship, such as Scott Dixon, Jeff Gordon, Fernando Alonso, Shane van Gisbergen and Kyle Busch.

Unlike the Le Mans event, the Daytona race is conducted entirely over a closed course within the speedway arena without the use of any public streets. Most parts of the steep banking are included, interrupted with a chicane on the back straight and a sweeping, fast infield section which includes two hairpins. Unlike Le Mans, the race is held in wintertime, when nights are at their longest. There are lights installed around the circuit for night racing, although the infield section is still not as well-lit as the main oval. However, the stadium lights are turned on only to a level of 20%, similar to the stadium lighting setup at Le Mans, with brighter lights around the pit straight, and decent lighting similar to street lights around the circuit.

==GTP==
After several ownership changes at IMSA which changed the direction the organization followed, it was decided by the 1990s that the Daytona event would align with the Grand-Am series, a competitor of the American Le Mans Series, which, as its name implies, uses the same regulations as the Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Grand Am series, though, is instead closely linked to NASCAR and the original ideas of IMSA and focused on controlled costs and close competition.

In order to make sports car racing less expensive than elsewhere, new rules were introduced in 2002. The dedicated Daytona Prototypes (DP) use less expensive materials and technologies and the car&#x27;s simple aerodynamics reduce the development and testing costs. The DPs began racing in 2003 with six cars in the race.

Specialist chassis makers like Riley, Dallara, and Lola provide the DP cars for the teams and the engines are branded under the names of major car companies like Cadillac, Lexus, Ford, BMW, and Porsche.

2017 saw the introduction of the DPi prototypes. These cars were based on LMP2 chassis with a custom engine and bodywork from a major manufacturer.

For 2023, the race adopted the LMDh prototype specification, although Le Mans Hypercars were also permitted. The series has also returned to the Grand Touring Prototype name from the 1980&#x27;s.

==GT Daytona==

The Gran Turismo class cars at Daytona are closer to the road versions, similar to the GT3 class elsewhere. For example, the more standard Cup version of the Porsche 996 is used, instead of the usual RS/RSR racing versions. Recent Daytona entries also include BMW M3s and M6s, Porsche 911s, Chevy Camaros and Corvettes, Mazda RX-8s, Pontiac GTO.Rs, and Ferrari F430 Challenges. The Audi R8 and the Ferrari 458 Italia debuted in the 50th anniversary of the race in 2012.

From the era of the IMSA GTO and GTU until the 2015 rule changes, spaceframe cars clad in lookalike body panels to compete in GT (the new BMW M6, Chevrolet Camaro, and Mazda RX-8). These rules are similar to the old GTO specification, but with more restrictions. The intent of spaceframe cars is to allow teams to save money, especially after crashes, where teams can rebuild the cars for the next race at a much lower cost, or even redevelop cars, instead of having to write off an entire car after a crash or at the end of a year.

Starting in 2014 the GT Daytona class was restricted exclusively to Group GT3 cars. Alongside this came the GTLM class, using LM GTE cars, similar to the WEC. In 2022 the GTLM class was replaced by GTD Pro, using the same cars as GTD. A single GTLM car, the Corvette C8.R, was also permitted to compete in the class with its performance adjusted to the GTD cars.

IMSA adapted its current structuring of the class in the 2022 season. These changes split the GT Daytona class into GTD and GTD PRO. Both GTD classes use identical cars built to the FIA GT3 technical regulations. The only difference is that GTD requires one amateur driver (with a silver or bronze rating) while driver selection is open in GTD PRO.

==GX Class==
The 2013 race was the first and only year for the GX class. Six cars started in the event. The class consisted of purpose-built production Porsche Cayman S and Mazda 6 racecars. Mazda debuted their first diesel racecar there which was the first time a diesel fuel racecar ever started at the Daytona 24. Throughout the race, the Caymans were dominant, while all three Mazdas suffered premature engine failure and retired from the race. By a 9-lap lead, the #16 Napleton Porsche Cayman, driven by David Donohue, was the GX winner.

==Statistics==

===Multiple wins by driver===
===Wins by manufacturer===
Porsche has the most overall victories of any manufacturer with 23, scored by various models, including the road-based 911, 935, and 996. Porsche also won a record 11 consecutive races from 1977 to 1987 and won 18 out of 23 races from 1968 to 1991. The German carmaker also claimed to earn back-to-back wins overall in both the 2024 and 2025 races.

===Wins by engine manufacturer===
In addition to their 19 wins as both car and engine manufacturer, Porsche has four wins solely as an engine manufacturer, in 1984, and 1995, and two in the Daytona Prototype era, in 2009 and 2010. General Motors has 10 wins between its Oldsmobile, Pontiac, Chevrolet, and Cadillac brands.

<text>Vivien Theodore Thomas (August 29, 1910 – November 26, 1985) was an American laboratory supervisor who, in the 1940s, played a major role in developing a procedure now called the Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt used to treat blue baby syndrome (now known as cyanotic heart disease) along with surgeon Alfred Blalock and cardiologist Helen B. Taussig. He was the assistant to Blalock in Blalock&#x27;s experimental animal laboratory at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, and later at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. Thomas was unique in that he did not have any professional education or experience in a research laboratory; however, he served as supervisor of the surgical laboratories at Johns Hopkins for 35 years. In 1976, Johns Hopkins awarded him an honorary doctorate and named him an Instructor of Surgery for the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Without any education past high school, Thomas rose above poverty and racism to become a cardiac surgery pioneer and a teacher of operative techniques to many of the country&#x27;s most prominent surgeons.

A PBS documentary, &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot;, was broadcast in 2003 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience&quot;. In the 2004 HBO movie &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;, based on Katie McCabe&#x27;s National Magazine Award–winning &quot;Washingtonian&quot; article of the same title, Vivien Thomas was portrayed by Mos Def.

==Background==
Vivien Thomas writes in his autobiography, published shortly after his death, that he was born in Lake Providence, Louisiana, in 1910. Thomas was born during the Jim Crow era, to Willard Maceo Thomas and the former Mary Alice Eaton. There are noted discrepancies in references to Thomas&#x27; birthplace due to his listing New Iberia as his birthplace on his World War II draft card, and when he died in 1985, his obituary in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; also listed New Iberia. New Iberia was his mother&#x27;s hometown, Lake Providence his father&#x27;s. Either way, the family did not stay in Louisiana for long, moving to Nashville, Tennessee, when Thomas was about two years old.

Thomas attended Pearl High School in Nashville in the 1920s, and graduated in 1929. Thomas&#x27; father was a carpenter, and took pleasure in passing down his expertise to his sons. Thomas worked with his father and brothers every day after school and on Saturdays, doing jobs such as measuring, sawing, and nailing. This experience proved beneficial to Thomas, as he was able to secure a carpentry job at Fisk University repairing facility damages after graduating from high school. Thomas had hoped to attend college and become a doctor, but the Great Depression derailed his plans. Thomas intended to work hard, save money, and gain a higher education as soon as he could afford it. Determined to broaden his skill set, in 1930 he reached out to childhood friend Charles Manlove (who was working at Vanderbilt University at the time) to ask if there were any jobs available.

== Career ==
In the wake of the stock market crash in October 1929, Thomas put his educational plans on hold and, through a friend, secured a job in February 1930 as surgical research assistant with Dr. Alfred Blalock at Vanderbilt University. On his first day of work, Thomas assisted Blalock with a surgical experiment on a dog. At the end of Thomas&#x27; first day, Blalock told Thomas they would do another experiment the next morning. Blalock told Thomas to &quot;come in and put the animal to sleep and get it set up.&quot; Within a few weeks, Thomas was starting surgery on his own. Thomas was classified and paid as a janitor, despite the fact that by the mid-1930s, he was doing the work of a postdoctoral researcher in the lab.

Thomas struggled with finances despite saving most of what he earned. The salaries that he received did not provide enough comfort for him to quit his laboratory research job and go back to school. Nashville&#x27;s banks failed nine months after Thomas started his job with Blalock, and his savings were wiped out. He abandoned his plans for college and medical school, relieved to have even a low-paying job as the Great Depression deepened. Thomas continued working with Blalock and saving his earnings, so that he could provide for his daughters and wife the best he could.

==Working with Blalock==
===Vanderbilt===

Thomas and Blalock did groundbreaking research into the causes of hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. This work later evolved into research on crush syndrome and saved the lives of thousands of soldiers on the battlefields of World War II. In hundreds of experiments, the two disproved traditional theories which held that shock was caused by toxins in the blood. Blalock, a highly original scientific thinker and something of an iconoclast, had theorized that shock resulted from fluid loss outside the vascular bed and that the condition could be effectively treated by fluid replacement. Assisted by Thomas, he was able to provide incontrovertible proof of this theory, and in so doing, he gained wide recognition in the medical community by the mid-1930s. At this same time, Blalock and Thomas began experimental work in vascular and cardiac surgery, defying medical taboos against operating on the heart. It was this work that laid the foundation for the revolutionary life-saving surgery they were to perform at Johns Hopkins a decade later. Vivien Thomas spent 11 years at Vanderbilt with Blalock before moving to Johns Hopkins.

===Johns Hopkins===

By 1940, the work Blalock had done with Thomas placed Blalock at the forefront of American surgery, and when he was offered the position of Chief of Surgery at his alma mater Johns Hopkins in 1941, he requested that Thomas accompany him. Thomas arrived in Baltimore with his family in June of that year, confronting a severe housing shortage and a level of racism worse than they had endured in Nashville. Johns Hopkins, like the rest of Baltimore, was rigidly segregated, and the only Black employees at the institution were janitors. When Thomas walked the halls in his white lab coat, many heads turned, and he began wearing city clothes when he walked from the laboratory to Blalock&#x27;s office because he received so much attention. During this time, he lived in the 1200 block of Caroline Street in the community now known as Oliver, Baltimore.

===Blue baby syndrome===

In 1943, while pursuing his shock research, Blalock was approached by pediatric cardiologist Helen Taussig, who was seeking a surgical solution to a complex and fatal four-part heart anomaly called tetralogy of Fallot (also known as blue baby syndrome, although other cardiac anomalies produce blueness, or cyanosis). In infants born with this defect, blood is shunted past the lungs, creating oxygen deprivation and a blue pallor. Having treated many such patients in her work in Johns Hopkins&#x27; Harriet Lane Home, Taussig was desperate to find a surgical cure. According to the accounts in Thomas&#x27; 1985 autobiography and in a 1967 interview with medical historian Peter Olch, Taussig suggested only that it might be possible to &quot;reconnect the pipes&quot; in some way to increase the level of blood flow to the lungs, but did not suggest how this could be accomplished. Blalock and Thomas realized immediately that the answer lay in a procedure they had perfected for a different purpose in their Vanderbilt work, involving the anastomosis (joining) of the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery, which had the effect of increasing blood flow to the lungs. Thomas was charged with the task of first creating a blue-baby–like condition in a dog, and then correcting the condition by means of the pulmonary-to-subclavian anastomosis. Among the dogs on whom Thomas operated was one named Anna, who became the first long-term survivor of the operation and the only animal to have her portrait hung on the walls of Johns Hopkins. In nearly two years of laboratory work involving 200 dogs, Thomas was able to replicate two of the four cardiac anomalies involved in tetralogy of Fallot. He did demonstrate that the corrective procedure was not lethal, thus persuading Blalock that the operation could be safely attempted on a human patient. Blalock was impressed with Thomas&#x27; work; when he inspected the procedure performed on Anna, he reportedly said, &quot;This looks like something the Lord made.&quot; Even though Thomas knew he was not allowed to operate on patients at that time, he still followed Blalock&#x27;s rules and assisted him during surgery.

===Decisive surgery===

On November 29, 1944, the procedure was first tried on a fifteen-month-old infant named Eileen Saxon. The blue baby syndrome had made her lips and fingers turn blue, with the rest of her skin having a very faint blue tinge. She could take only a few steps before beginning to breathe heavily. Because no instruments for cardiac surgery then existed, Thomas adapted the needles and clamps for the procedure from those in use in the animal lab. During the surgery itself, at Blalock&#x27;s request, Thomas stood on a step stool at Blalock&#x27;s shoulder and coached him step by step through the procedure. Thomas had performed the operation hundreds of times on a dog, whereas Blalock had done so only once as Thomas&#x27; assistant. The surgery was not completely successful, though it did prolong the infant&#x27;s life for several months. Blalock and his team operated again, on an 11-year-old girl, this time with complete success, and the patient was able to leave the hospital three weeks after the surgery. Next, they operated on a six-year-old boy, who dramatically regained his color at the end of the surgery. The three cases formed the basis for the article that was published in the May 1945 issue of the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;, giving credit to Blalock and Taussig for the procedure. Thomas received no mention.
News of this groundbreaking story was circulated around the world by the Associated Press. Newsreels touted the event, greatly enhancing the status of Johns Hopkins and solidifying the reputation of Blalock, who had been regarded as a maverick up until that point by some in the Johns Hopkins old guard. Thomas&#x27; contribution remained unacknowledged, both by Blalock and by Johns Hopkins. Within a year, the operation known as the Blalock–Thomas–Taussig shunt had been performed on more than 200 patients at Johns Hopkins, with parents bringing their suffering children from thousands of miles away.

Thomas&#x27; surgical techniques included one he developed in 1946 for improving circulation in patients whose great vessels (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) were transposed. A complex operation called an atrial septectomy, the procedure was executed so flawlessly by Thomas that Blalock, upon examining the nearly undetectable suture line, was prompted to remark, &quot;Vivien, this looks like something the Lord made.&quot; To the host of young surgeons Thomas trained during the 1940s, he became a figure of legend, the model of a dexterous and efficient cutting surgeon. &quot;Even if you&#x27;d never seen surgery before, you could do it because Vivien made it look so simple,&quot; the renowned surgeon Denton Cooley told &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine in 1989. &quot;There wasn&#x27;t a false move, not a wasted motion, when he operated.&quot; Surgeons like Cooley, along with Alex Haller, Frank Spencer, Rowena Spencer, and others credited Thomas with teaching them the surgical technique that placed them at the forefront of medicine in the United States. Despite the deep respect Thomas was accorded by these surgeons and by the many Black lab assistants he trained at Hopkins, he was not well paid. He sometimes resorted to working as a bartender, often at Blalock&#x27;s parties. This led to the peculiar circumstance of his serving drinks to people he had been teaching earlier in the day. Eventually, after negotiations on his behalf by Blalock, he became the highest-paid assistant at Johns Hopkins by 1946, and by far the highest-paid African American on the institution&#x27;s rolls. Although Thomas never wrote or spoke publicly about his ongoing desire to return to college and obtain a medical degree, his widow, the late Clara Flanders Thomas, revealed in a 1987 interview with &quot;Washingtonian&quot; writer Katie McCabe that her husband had clung to the possibility of further education throughout the blue baby period, and had abandoned the idea only with great reluctance. Mrs. Thomas stated that in 1947 Thomas had investigated the possibility of enrolling in college and pursuing his dream of becoming a doctor, but had been deterred by the inflexibility of Morgan State University, which refused to grant him credit for life experience and insisted that he fulfill the standard freshman requirements. Realizing that he would be 50 years old by the time he completed college and medical school, Thomas decided to give up the idea of further education.

===Relations with Blalock===
Vivien Thomas felt nervous when he first met Dr. Alfred Blalock because his friend Charles Manlove made it apparent that many people had a hard time working with Blalock. However, Thomas found Blalock to be pleasant, relaxed, and informal during his interview, which provided excitement and comfort. Thomas soon learned that Blalock moved quickly and expected his technicians to be just as efficient. As Blalock performed experiments daily, Thomas observed thoroughly so that he would be able to recreate the steps when Blalock had other responsibilities to attend to. However, there were times when Blalock would lose his temper and use profanity; this often bothered Thomas and threatened their stable working relationship.

During Thomas&#x27; time working at Vanderbilt in the lab, he struggled with his salary because he needed to be able to provide for himself, but he also was saving up to go back to school. After many encounters with Blalock about a pay raise and no results, Thomas was going to return to his old job as a carpenter. However, Blalock saw Thomas as a valuable asset and did everything he could to keep Thomas from leaving. Blalock&#x27;s approach to the issue of Thomas&#x27; race was complicated and contradictory throughout their 34-year partnership. Thomas, a laboratory technician, was paid only a janitorial salary. However, white men performing an equivalent of Thomas&#x27; job were paid an appreciable dollar more per hour. On the one hand, Blalock defended his choice of Thomas to his superiors at Vanderbilt and to Johns Hopkins colleagues, and he insisted that Thomas accompany him in the operating room during the first series of tetralogy operations. On the other hand, there were limits to his tolerance, especially when it came to issues of pay, academic acknowledgment, and his social interaction outside of work. Tension with Blalock continued to build when he failed to recognize the contributions that Thomas had made in the world-famous blue baby procedure, which led to a rift in their relationship. Thomas was absent in official articles about the procedure, as well as in team pictures that included all of the doctors involved in the procedure.

After Blalock&#x27;s death from cancer in 1964 at the age of 65, Thomas stayed at Johns Hopkins for 15 more years. In his role as director of Surgical Research Laboratories, he mentored a number of African American lab assistants as well as Hopkins&#x27; first Black cardiac resident, Levi Watkins Jr., whom Thomas assisted with his groundbreaking work in the use of the automatic implantable defibrillator.

Thomas&#x27; nephew, Koco Eaton, graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, trained by many of the physicians his uncle had trained. Eaton trained in orthopedics and as of 2024 is the team doctor for the Tampa Bay Rays.

===Institutional acknowledgment===

In 1968, the surgeons Thomas trained — who had then become chiefs of surgical departments throughout America — commissioned the painting of his portrait (by Bob Gee, oil on canvas, 1969, The Johns Hopkins Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives) and arranged to have it hung next to Blalock&#x27;s in the lobby of the Alfred Blalock Clinical Sciences Building.

In 1976, Johns Hopkins University presented Thomas with an honorary doctorate. Due to certain restrictions, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws, rather than a medical doctorate, but it did allow the staff and students of Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to call him &quot;Doctor&quot;. After working there for 37 years, Thomas was also finally appointed to the faculty of the School of Medicine as Instructor of Surgery, although due to his lack of an official medical degree, he was never allowed to operate on a living patient.

In July 2005, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine began the practice of splitting incoming classes of first-year students into four advisory &quot;colleges&quot;, each named for famous Hopkins faculty members who had had a major impact on the history of medicine. Thomas was chosen as one of the four, along with Helen Taussig, Florence Sabin, and Daniel Nathans.

In January 2020, Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center opened a center for collaboration among specialists in pediatric cardiology, pediatric cardiac surgery, and pediatric anesthesiology: the Blalock–Taussig–Thomas Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center.

==Personal life and death==

In the summer of 1933, Thomas met Clara Beatrice Flanders. Thomas was so fond of Flanders that he married her that same year on December 22, and the newlywed couple moved to Nashville, Tennessee. The couple had two daughters. Olga Fay, the oldest, was born in 1934, and Theodosia Patricia was born 4 years later in 1938.

In 1941, Thomas and his family moved to Baltimore so that he could continue working with Blalock.

In 1971, Thomas was recognized for all his work &quot;behind the scenes&quot; with a ceremony and the presentation of his portrait to the medical institution. Thomas spoke humbly to the full-capacity auditorium. He stated that he lived in humble satisfaction that he was able to help solve some of the world&#x27;s numerous health problems. He was overjoyed that he was finally getting recognition for his significant role in the research leading to developmental skills that many surgeons had begun to practice.

On July 1, 1976, Thomas was appointed to the faculty as Instructor of Surgery; Thomas served in that capacity for three years and retired in 1979. 

A member of the Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church, he was named Man of the Year in 1980 by the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church.

Following his retirement, Thomas began work on an autobiography. He died of pancreatic cancer on November 26, 1985. He was survived by his wife, Clara née Flanders, their two daughters, and three granddaughters. His autobiography, &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot;, was published just days later.

==Legacy==

Having learned about Thomas on the day of his death, &quot;Washingtonian&quot; writer Katie McCabe brought his story to public attention in a 1989 article entitled &quot;Like Something the Lord Made&quot;, which won the 1990 National Magazine Award for Feature Writing. This caused various film producers to contact Thomas&#x27;s surviving family members in search of the film rights to his story. In 2004, Eaton, Thomas&#x27;s nephew, estimated that he had signed five different deals over the years to allow film companies to tell his uncle&#x27;s story. 

The McCabe article inspired the PBS documentary &quot;Partners of the Heart&quot;, which was broadcast in 2003 on PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Experience&quot; and won the Erik Barnouw Award for Best History Documentary in 2004 from the Organization of American Historians. The McCabe article was also brought to Hollywood through the persistent efforts of Washington, D.C., dentist Irving Sorkin, and formed the basis for the Emmy- and Peabody Award–winning 2004 HBO film &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot;. 

Thomas&#x27; legacy as an educator and scientist continued with the institution of the Vivien Thomas Young Investigator Awards, given by the Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesiology beginning in 1996. In 1993, the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation instituted the Vivien Thomas Scholarship for Medical Science and Research, sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline. In fall 2004, the Baltimore City Public School System opened the Vivien T. Thomas Medical Arts Academy. In the halls of the school hangs a replica of Thomas&#x27; portrait commissioned by his surgeon-trainees in 1969. The &quot;Journal of Surgical Case Reports&quot; announced in January 2010 that its annual prizes for the best case report written by a doctor and best case report written by a medical student would be named after Thomas.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center created the Vivien T. Thomas Award for Excellence in Clinical Research, recognizing excellence in conducting clinical research.

<text>Lieutenant General Richard Prescott (1725–1788) was a British officer born in England.

==Military career==
Prescott was appointed a major of the 33rd Regiment of Foot on 20 December 1756. He transferred to the 72nd Regiment of Foot on 9 May 1758, and became lieutenant-colonel of the 17th Regiment of Foot on 14 December 1761. He transferred to the 50th Regiment of Foot in May 1762, with which he served in the Holy Roman Empire during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

Prescott transferred to the 7th Regiment of Foot and was brevetted colonel in the army on 25 June 1772; he went to Canada in 1773. On the reduction of Montreal by the Americans in 1775, Prescott attempted to take Quebec from American forces in 1775, but was forced to surrender to the Americans on 17 November. In September 1776, he was exchanged for General John Sullivan. In November, he became colonel of his regiment. In December, he was third in command of the expedition against Rhode Island, where he remained in command of the British forces before the Battle of Rhode Island.

Lieutenant-Colonel William Barton and a force of 40 men captured Prescott at his quarters on Prescott Farm in Rhode Island on 10 July 1777 and took him to Providence. Prescott was eventually moved and imprisoned in Connecticut, splitting time between East Windsor and Enfield. He was later again exchanged, this time for General Charles Lee. Prescott resumed his command in Rhode Island but was almost immediately superseded by Sir Robert Pigot.

<doc id="679726" wikidata="Q1543160" url="?curid=679726" title="The Who by Numbers">
<text>The Who by Numbers is the seventh studio album by English rock band the Who, released on 3 October 1975 in the United Kingdom through Polydor Records, and on 6 October 1975 in the United States by MCA Records. It was named the tenth-best album of the year in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll.

==Background==
Pete Townshend has claimed that the band recorded practically every song he had written for &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot;, partially due to a writer&#x27;s block that he was experiencing at the time. The songs on the album were, for the most part, more introspective and personal than many other songs that the band had released. Townshend&#x27;s 30th birthday occurred in May 1975; he was troubled with thoughts of being too old to play rock and roll and that the band was losing its relevance. He began to feel disenchanted with the music industry, a feeling that he carried into his songs. He said of the songs on the album:

After concluding the tour for the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; album in June 1974, the Who took an extended hiatus and did not perform live for more than a year. John Entwistle kept himself occupied by playing solo gigs. In addition, the band spent this time filming &quot;Tommy&quot;, based on their rock opera of the same title.

This was the band&#x27;s first album on Polydor. The sessions for &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; began in April 1975 and continued through early June. The album was released in October and the band supported it with a tour, which spanned some 70 concerts before concluding in the autumn of 1976.

For the album&#x27;s recording, the band recruited producer Glyn Johns. The band had worked previously with Johns on the 1971 album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. Compared to previous Who albums, &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; took an unusually long time to complete (as noted above, nearly three months) and was marred by numerous breaks and interruptions due to the band members&#x27; growing boredom and lack of interest. It features some of the darkest songs ever recorded by the band. Only the songs on the first side of &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; were performed live, and only &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; became a concert staple. &quot;Imagine a Man&quot; was performed live for the first time by the band in May 2019, nearly 44 years after its release. Roger Daltrey had featured the song in a solo concert in February 1994. Townshend said of the album&#x27;s recording sessions:

==Album cover==
The album cover, on which the band members&#x27; bodies are depicted as connect the dots puzzles, was drawn by John Entwistle. In 1996, when asked about the cover, he replied: &quot;The first [piece of artwork] release[d] is &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; cover, which I never got paid for, so now I&#x27;m going to get paid. (laughs) We were taking it in turns to do the covers. It was Pete&#x27;s turn before me and we did the &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; cover, which cost about the same as a small house back then, about £16,000. My cover cost £32.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; peaked at number 7 on the UK Albums Chart and number 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape album chart in the US. &quot;Squeeze Box&quot; was also a Top 20 hit in both Britain and America, although the US follow-up, &quot;Slip Kid&quot;, failed to chart.

The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of &quot;The Who by Numbers&quot; stated: &quot;They may have made their greatest album in the face of [their personal problems]. But only time will tell.&quot;

In an interview from &quot;Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B&quot;, Townshend declared &quot;Dreaming from the Waist&quot; and &quot;Sister Disco&quot; (from &quot;Who Are You&quot;) as his least favourite songs to play on stage. In contrast, Entwistle declared in the same series of interviews that &quot;Dreaming from the Waist&quot; was one of his favourite songs to perform live. Daltrey referred to the album as his favourite in his memoir.

==Remasters and reissues==
The 1996 remaster was remixed by Jon Astley.

On 24 December 2011, the album was remastered and reissued in Japan using the original mix. The live bonus tracks from the previous edition were included on the reissue. The packaging replicated the original vinyl release of the album.

<text>Frank A. Dunn is a Canadian business executive who was the chief executive officer of Nortel Networks. Dunn joined Nortel Networks (when it was still known as Northern Electric) as a management trainee in 1976, after graduating from McGill University. He worked his way up through the company and was appointed CFO in 1999 under CEO John Roth. After Roth retired, the Board of Directors appointed Dunn CEO in November 2001. 

In 2007, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud charges against him, and three former senior executives, in a wide-ranging financial fraud scheme. The SEC said that at least a year&#x27;s worth of the alleged misconduct took place while John Roth was still CEO of Nortel, though no charges were laid against him. Roth left the company with an estimated $139 million in salary and stock options. 

On June 19, 2008, Dunn (then aged 54) was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, along with two other former Nortel executives, charged with fraud affecting the public market, falsification of books and documents and producing a false prospectus.[5]. 

On January 14, 2013, Ontario Superior Court Justice Frank Marrocco dismissed fraud charges against former Nortel chief executive Frank Dunn, former chief financial officer Douglas Beatty and ex-controller Michael Gollogly, saying the Crown had failed to meet “the high standard of proof” in a criminal case. “I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Frank A. Dunn, Douglas C. Beatty and Michael J. Gollogly deliberately misrepresented the financial results of Nortel Networks Corporation,” Justice Marrocco said in his ruling. This came four years to the day after Nortel sought bankruptcy protection and began liquidating.

On December 19, 2014, remaining civil charges from the OSC and SEC were simultaneously dropped against Dunn and several of his former colleagues. Ultimately, no civil or criminal charges were successfully brought against Dunn or any others individuals connected to the Nortel accounting scandal.

<text>Pontardawe () is a town and a community in the lower Swansea Valley (). it had a population of approximately 7,172 in the 2021 Census for Pontardawe Parish, and forms part of the county borough of Neath Port Talbot. 

On the opposite bank of the River Tawe is the village of Alltwen, part of the community of Cilybebyll, and is administered separately from Pontardawe. The town is at the crossroads of the A474 road and the A4067 road.

Pontardawe came into existence as a small settlement on the north-western bank of the RiverTawe, where the drovers&#x27; road from Neath and Llandeilo crossed the river to go up the valley to Brecon. The National Cycle Route 43 from Swansea to Builth Wells passes through the town and the recreation ground.

==History==
The name, which translates to &quot;bridge on the Tawe&quot;, first appears on a map in 1729, as &quot;Pont-ar-Dawye&quot; in Emanuel Bowen&#x27;s &quot;New and Accurate Map of South Wales&quot;. By 1796, the Swansea Canal had connected Pontardawe with Swansea Docks. Accessibility by canal enabled the industrial development of the area, which started with the Ynysderw ironworks in 1835. Close to the ironworks, tinplate and steelworks became the basis of the town&#x27;s development during the latter part of the 19th century, exporting products to all parts of the world. The industrialist William Parsons of Neath (1795-1864) developed the town&#x27;s early industry, but from 1861 onwards, for the next 90 years, the Gilbertson family were the most important proprietors in the town, manufacturing iron, steel and tinplate. As well as metalwork, there was also significant coal mining in the area and a pottery at Ynysmeudwy. These industries declined during the 20th century. Small engineering firms, motor maintenance, building supplies, and a health centre, are on the Alloy Industrial Estate.

The Church of St Peter, which has French-style architecture, was financed by William Parsons and completed in 1862.

From 1861 until 1964, a railway line connected Pontardawe with the rest of the valley and further afield. The Swansea Vale Railway (SVR) was founded in 1845 to develop and extend the short tramroad which had been opened nearly 30 years earlier to transport the coal down the lower part of the valley to the Swansea docks. It was extended to Pontardawe and Ystalyfera in 1861, and to Brynamman in 1863. On 1 October 1873, the SVR opened a branch from Ynysygeinon, near Ystalyfera, to Coelbren on the Neath and Brecon Railway, thereby connecting Pontardawe for the first time to the national rail network.
The Midland Railway took over operation of the SVR from 1 September 1874; and by 1877 there were three passenger trains a day calling at Pontardawe in each direction, conveying through carriages between Swansea and Brecon, Hereford, Malvern, Worcester and Birmingham. Traffic on the route began declining between the wars, and passenger services to Brecon were withdrawn in 1931 and those to Brynamman in 1950. The railway line through Pontardawe finally closed to all traffic in 1964.

==Landmarks==

The best-known landmark is the tall spire of St Peter&#x27;s Church which dominates the centre of the town from its site on a high point of the valley floor close to the Swansea Canal.

The town includes two sections of the Swansea Canal with a total length of . The old stone bridge of Pontardawe was built by William Edwards of Eglwsilan, a famous bridge builder. He also built the Old Bridge at Pontypridd, which was the longest single-span bridge in the world when it was constructed, as well as the bridge at Cenarth. Edwards was also responsible for the design of Morriston, a new town developed by the Swansea Valley industrialist Sir John Morris.

==Politics==
Prior to local government reorganisation in 1974, Pontardawe and district was served by Pontardawe Rural District Council; this merged in 1974 to become part of Lliw Valley DC and was subsequently reorganised again when the Pontardawe area became a part of Neath Port Talbot county borough. Pontardawe Town Council is currently controlled by Plaid Cymru.

The constituency office of Jeremy Miles MS is in the town. As part of the South Wales West regional constituency, Pontardawe is also represented by Tom Giffard MS, Altaf Hussain MS, Sioned Williams MS, and Luke Fletcher MS.

==Music and arts==

The Pontardawe Arts Centre stages performances by musicians of both national and international fame.

Every August from 1978, Pontardawe hosted the Pontardawe Festival; held on a weekend on the leisure centre playing-fields at Parc Ynysderw. This event featured singing, dancing, and other artistic performances from all over the world. Several years of bad weather affected admissions and due to the withdrawal of arts funding, the festival has ceased.

==Retail==
The first phase of a new retail park on Ffordd Parc Ynysderw, close to Cwmtawe Community School, opened in July 2008.

In 2008, the Pontardawe Chamber for Trade &amp; Commerce was formed. The goal is to promote business and rekindle a sense of community in and around the area, which had been lost following the arrival of nearby superstores. Seasonal festivals are held in the town centre.

The playing fields adjoining the Pontardawe Leisure Centre at Parc Ynysderw are one of the UK&#x27;s 471 King George Fields established as a memorial to King George V. They were officially transferred to their present site in 2003 and occupy land which formerly belonged to the tinplate works but is now owned and maintained by the local authority. The Cwmtawe rugby sevens competition is held at Parc Ynysderw.

Pontardawe has an Air Cadets unit – 1358 (Pontardawe) Squadron – that is open to both boys and girls aged 12 (in Year 8) to 18. Activities include flying, gliding, adventure training, first aid, and The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award.

Pontardawe has a successful karate and kickboxing team who are members of the Welsh Contact Karate Association.

<text>In system administration, orchestration is the automated configuration, coordination, deployment, development, and management of computer systems and software.
Many tools exist to automate server configuration and management.

==Usage==
Orchestration is often discussed in the context of service-oriented architecture, virtualization, provisioning, converged infrastructure and dynamic data center topics. Orchestration in this sense is about aligning the business request with the applications, data, and infrastructure.

In the context of cloud computing, the main difference between workflow automation and orchestration is that workflows are processed and completed as processes within a single domain for automation purposes, whereas orchestration includes a workflow and provides a directed action towards larger goals and objectives.

In this context, and with the overall aim to achieve specific goals and objectives (described through the quality of service parameters), for example, meet application performance goals using minimized cost and maximize application performance within budget constraints, cloud management solutions also encompass frameworks for workflow mapping and management.

<text>The Hungary national football team (, ) represents Hungary in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Hungarian Football Federation. The team has made nine appearances in the FIFA World Cup, and five in the UEFA European Championship. Hungary plays their home matches at the Puskás Aréna, in Budapest, which opened in November 2019.

Hungary has a respectable football history, having won three Olympic titles, finishing runners-up in the 1938 and 1954 World Cups, and third in the 1964 European Championship. Hungary revolutionized the sport in the 1950s, laying the tactical fundamentals of Total Football and dominating international football with the remarkable Golden Team which included legend Ferenc Puskás, one of the top goalscorers of the 20th century, to whom FIFA dedicated the Puskás Award, given annually to the player who scored the &quot;most beautiful&quot; goal of the calendar year. The side of that era has the all-time highest Football Elo Ranking in the world, with 2230 in 1954, and one of the longest undefeated runs in football history, remaining unbeaten in 31 games, spanning over four years including the much heralded Match of the Century.

The Hungarian team faced a severe drought starting from their elimination at the 1986 World Cup, failing to qualify for a major tournament for thirty years and reaching their lowest FIFA ranking (87) in 1996, as well as finishing sixth in their group of the Euro 2008 qualifiers. They then began a turnaround, qualifying for three consecutive European Championships in 2016, 2020 and 2024, as well as achieving promotion to the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A.

==History==

Although Austria and Hungary were constituent countries of the dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, they formed separate football associations and teams around the start of the 20th century.

===Early years===

====1910s====

The national side first appeared at the Summer Olympic Games in 1912 in Stockholm, Sweden. The team had to ask for donations in order to be able to go to the Games. Hungary lost 7–0 to England and thus were eliminated.
After the Olympic Games Hungary played two matches against Russia in Moscow. The first match was a 9–0 win and the second 12–0, which is still a record for the national side. The top scorer of the two matches was Imre Schlosser who scored seven goals. The beginning of World War I had a deep impact on the thriving Hungarian football. Both the country and the clubs were suffering financial problems. During WWI Hungary played Austria 16 times. In 1919 England claimed the exclusion of the Central Powers (including Hungary) from FIFA. When FIFA refused England&#x27;s plea, the British (English, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish) associations decided to resign from FIFA.

====1920s====

Budapest was denied the opportunity to host the 1920 Summer Olympics, which were held in Belgium. The countries of the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria) were excluded from the Olympics. Hungary used a unique 2–3–5 formation.

During this period the Fogl brothers (József and Károly Fogl) played in the national team. Between 1921 and 1924, Béla Guttmann also played six times for the team. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Guttmann objected to the fact that there were more officials than players in the Hungary squad and that the hotel was more suitable for socialising than match preparation, and to demonstrate his disapproval he hung dead rats on the doors of the travelling officials. At the 1924 Summer Olympics, in the first match Hungary beat Poland. They then lost to Egypt. As a consequence, both the head coach and the head of the Hungarian Football Federation resigned.

Between 1927 and 1930, Hungary participated in the Central European International Cup which is considered to be the first international tournament, with Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy and Switzerland. In the final, Hungary lost to Italy 5–0. On 12 June 1927, Hungary beat France 13–1, which is still a record. József Takács scored six goals.

===Golden Era===

====1930s====

The first FIFA World Cup was held in Uruguay in 1930, but Hungary were not invited and did not take part in the tournament; there were no qualification matches. Hungary first appeared in the 1934 World Cup in Italy. Hungary&#x27;s first World Cup match was against Egypt on 27 May 1934, a 4–2 win. The goals were scored by Pál Teleki, Géza Toldi (2) and Jenő Vincze. In the quarter-finals, Hungary faced neighbouring arch-rivals Austria and lost 2–1, the only Hungarian goal coming from György Sárosi.

Hungary entered the 1936 Olympics, where in the first round they were eliminated by Poland, 0–3.

The 1938 World Cup was held in France. The first match was played against Dutch East Indies and Hungary won 6–0. Sárosi and Gyula Zsengellér each scored twice while Vilmos Kohut and Toldi scored one goal each. In the quarter-finals, Hungary beat Switzerland 2–0 with goals by Sárosi and Zsengellér. In the semi-final at the Parc des Princes, Paris, Hungary beat Sweden 5–1 with goals by Ferenc Sas and Sárosi and a hat-trick by Zsengellér. In the final, Hungary faced Italy at the Stade Olympique de Colombes, Paris and fell 4–2. The Hungarian goals were scored by Pál Titkos and Sárosi.

====1950s====
This Hungarian team was best known as one of the most formidable and influential sides in football history, which revolutionised the play of the game. Centred around the dynamic and potent quartet of strikers Ferenc Puskás, Sándor Kocsis, attacking half-back József Bozsik and second striker Nándor Hidegkuti, the &quot;Aranycsapat&quot; (&quot;Golden Team&quot;) of the &quot;Magnificent Magyars&quot; captivated the football world with an exciting brand of play with innovative tactical nuances. Excluding the 1954 World Cup Final, they achieved a remarkable record of 43 victories, 6 draws, and 0 defeats from 14 May 1950 until they lost 3–1 to Turkey on 19 February 1956.
In the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Hungary beat Romania 2–1 with a goal each from Czibor and Kocsis in the preliminary round. In the first round Hungary beat Italy 3–0; in the quarter-finals Hungary beat Turkey 7–1; and in the semi-finals Hungary faced Sweden, the 1948 Olympic champions and won 6–0. In the final, Hungary beat Yugoslavia 2–0 with a goal each from Puskás and Czibor and thus won the Olympic title for the first time.

On 25 November 1953, England played Hungary at Wembley Stadium, London in a match later dubbed as the &quot;match of the century&quot;. The English team were unbeaten for 90 years at home. In front of 105,000 spectators Nándor Hidegkuti scored in the first minute. At half-time the score was 4–2 to Hungary. In the second half the Hungarians scored twice more (Hidegkúti and József Bozsik). The final score was 6–3.

On 23 May 1954, the Hungary national team beat England 7–1 (which remains their worst defeat to date) at the Puskás Ferenc Stadium. At that time in Hungary there was a saying about the match: &quot;Az angolok egy hétre jöttek és hét-egyre mentek&quot;, which is a double play on words. The word &quot;week&quot; in Hungarian is called &quot;hét&quot;, meaning the number seven: &quot;the English came for one week and left with 7:1.&quot;

The 1954 World Cup was held in Switzerland. The first match was played against South Korea and Hungary won 9–0 at the Hardturm, Zürich. In the second group match, Hungary played against West Germany and won 8–3 at St. Jakob Stadium, Basel. In the quarter-finals, Hungary beat Brazil 4–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium, Bern. In the semi-finals, Hungary faced two-time World Cup winner Uruguay in Lausanne; Hungary won 4–2 after extra time. In the final, Hungary played West Germany again. Although Hungary won the group match against the Germans, they lost 3–2 in the final in Bern at the Wankdorf Stadium. The Golden Team, built around the legendary Ferenc Puskás, led 2–0, but ended up losing 2–3 in a game the West Germans subsequently christened &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot;. In 2010, journalist Erik Eggers speculates in a study that the German team may have used drugs to beat the Hungarian team, who were considered &quot;invincible&quot; at that time.

Hungary saw the 1956 revolution break out just weeks before the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, which was also the scene of the Blood in the Water Match. The football team also qualified as the defending champions, but they were withdrawn from the tournament. The political situation in Hungary caused several athletes to defect during the Olympics, including key players in the team. This marked the effective end of the Golden Team, as they would never play for the national team again. Among others, Puskás moved to Real Madrid and later played for Spain, whereas Kocsis and Czibor left for Barcelona.

Hungary qualified for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. They played their first match against Wales at the Jarnvallen stadium in Sandviken and drew 1–1. The second group match was played against hosts Sweden, where Hungary lost 2–1 at the Råsunda Stadium, Solna. Although Hungary won their last group match against Mexico at the Jarnvallen stadium in Sandvinken, they were eliminated from the World Cup after losing a play-off to Wales, who they had drawn level with on points. The Welsh had drawn all their group matches and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match to decide which nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through, as the Hungarians had a goal tally of 6–3 compared to 2–2 for Wales. As it was, Wales instead met Brazil in the quarter-finals and were the recipient of young Pelé&#x27;s first World Cup goal.

====1960s====

In 1960, Hungary entered the Olympics held in Rome and was drawn into Group D with France, Peru and India. Hungary finished top of the group after winning all matches by a combined goal difference of +12. In the semi-finals, they lost to Denmark 0–2, but beat Italy in the bronze medal match 2–1 thanks to a goals from Orosz and Dunai.

Hungary qualified for the 1962 World Cup, held in Chile. On 31 May 1962, in the first group match, Hungary beat England 2–1 thanks to goals scored by Lajos Tichy and Flórián Albert at El Teniente stadium in Rancagua. The second match on 3 June was even more convincing against Bulgaria; the match was won 6–1 in Rancagua. The last group match was against Argentina and it was a goalless draw. Hungary qualified for the quarter-finals by gaining five points and winning the group. In the quarter-finals, however, Hungary was eliminated by Czechoslovakia by 1–0 at El Teniente.

In 1964, Hungary again qualified for the 1964 Olympics held in Tokyo and was drawn into Group B with defending champions Yugoslavia, Morocco and North Korea, the latter withdrawing. In their first match against Morocco, Hungary won 6–0 with all six goals scored by Ferenc Bene. In their second match, Hungary won narrowly (6–5) against Yugoslavia and advanced into the next round along with runners-up Yugoslavia. In the quarter-finals, Hungary beat Romania 2–0 with goals from Csernai. In the semi-finals, they beat United Arab Republic (Egypt) 6–0 with four goals from Bene and two from Komora. In the final, Hungary beat Czechoslovakia 2–1 thanks from an own goal by Weiss and a goal by Bene, winning their second gold medal.

Hungary qualified for the 1964 European Nations&#x27; Cup which was held in Spain. They played against Spain in the semi-finals, losing 2–1 after extra time. The only Hungarian goal was scored by Ferenc Bene. In the third place play-off Hungary beat Denmark 3–1 after extra time.
Hungary also managed to qualify for the 1966 World Cup which was held in England. On 13 July, Hungary lost their first group match against Eusébio&#x27;s Portugal (3–1) at Old Trafford in Manchester. Two days later, in the second group match Hungary beat Brazil at Goodison Park, Liverpool. In the last group match, on 20 July, Hungary beat Bulgaria 3–1. Hungary finished second in the group and qualified for the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by the Soviet Union 2–1 at Roker Park in Sunderland.

In 1968 Olympics, Hungary qualified as defending champions to defend their title and was drawn into Group C with Israel, Ghana and El Salvador. Hungary finished top and advanced into the next round with Israel. In the quarter-finals, Hungary beat Guatemala narrowly, 1–0. In the semi-finals, they beat Japan 5–0. In the final, they beat Bulgaria 4–1 and won their third title, being the most successful team at the Olympics in football (Great Britain also won three titles but their first title is in 1904, and football only became an official event in 1908). However, Hungary failed to qualify for the 1970 FIFA World Cup, following a heavy 4–1 defeat to Czechoslovakia during a qualification play-off, which many see as the beginning of a period of long-standing decline.

Flórián Albert was named European Footballer of the Year in 1967. He scored 255 goals in 351 matches from 1958 to 1974.

===Slow regression===
====1970s====
Hungary came back again as long-time defending champions in the 1972 Olympics in Munich and was drawn into Group C with Denmark, Iran and Brazil. They finished top and advanced into the next round with Denmark. In their second group round, they were drawn into Group 1 with East Germany, West Germany and Mexico. They again finished top undefeated and advanced into the finals with East Germany. In the finals, they faced Poland and lost 1–2.

Hungary qualified for the finals of the UEFA Euro 1972 which was held in Belgium. In the semi-finals, Hungary faced the Soviet Union and lost 1–0. In the third place play-off, Hungary lost to Belgium 2–1. The Hungarians would not appear at the European Championship again until Euro 2016.

Hungary participated in the 1978 World Cup which was held in Argentina. Facing the hosts, Argentina won the match 2–1. Hungary played their second group match against Italy and the &quot;Azzurri&quot; emerged victorious, 3–1. Hungary&#x27;s third match was played against Michel Platini&#x27;s France losing 3–1.
====1980s====
During the 1980s, Hungary qualified for the World Cup twice. The first group match of the 1982 tournament in Spain was played against El Salvador, where Hungary won 10–1 at Estadio Nuevo, Elche. After the massive win, the Magyars lost to 4–1 to Diego Maradona&#x27;s Argentina in the second match of the group stages. Maradona scored twice, while the only Hungarian goal was scored by Pölöskei at the Estadio José Rico Pérez in Alicante. After Hungary drew in the last match against Belgium, they were eliminated from the World Cup.

Hungary&#x27;s last World Cup appearance to date was the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. In the first match of the group Hungary lost 6–0 to the Soviet Union. Although Hungary won their second match against Canada 2–0, they lost to Michel Platini&#x27;s France 3–0 in the last group match.

===Era of decline===
====1990s====
During the 1990s, Hungary were not able to qualify for any international tournaments except for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. In 1996, the team reached its lowest FIFA World Ranking at 87th. The fall of the Hungarian communist regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like Ferencváros and Újpest faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This had a profound effect on the Hungary national team as well, as earlier, the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the Bosman ruling; since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they were not able to compete with richer Western European clubs.

Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskás was appointed as the head coach of the national side in 1993. He led the team for only four matches, however, as the former Honvéd and Real Madrid star failed to make an impact. The only success in the 1990s was the qualification of Hungary to the 1996 Summer Olympics. Antal Dunai&#x27;s team played its first group match against Nigeria and lost to 1–0 in Orlando. In the second group match, Hungary played Brazil and lost 3–1. The last group match was played against Japan, a 3–2 loss. Hungary were eliminated in the 1998 World Cup qualifying play-offs by Yugoslavia with a 12–1 aggregate score.
====2000s====
During the 2000s, the Hungarian national soccer team faced several challenges and did not achieve significant success in major international tournaments. They struggled to qualify for major competitions like the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship. Despite their efforts, the team often fell short in the qualification stages, which was a source of disappointment for fans and players alike. The lack of consistent performance and the inability to compete at the highest levels led to a period of stagnation for Hungarian soccer on the international stage.

However, there was a bright spot in 2009 when the Hungary U-20 team won a bronze medal at the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt. The U-20 team’s success was seen as a potential turning point for Hungarian soccer, highlighting the country’s ability to develop young talent, including Vladimir Koman and Ádám Szalai.

Throughout the decade, Hungarian clubs also made some progress in European competitions, though they did not reach the later stages. The domestic league saw fluctuating performances, with clubs like Ferencváros and Debrecen occasionally making it to the group stages of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League.

===Resurgence===
====2010s====

The Hungary national under-20 team head coach Sándor Egervári was appointed as head coach for the senior side ahead of Euro 2012 qualifying in which Hungary were drawn against Finland, Moldova, the Netherlands, San Marino and Sweden. Hungary won six, drew one and lost three games as they finished the group in third place with 19 points. During the qualification process, in September 2011, Hungary reached the 27th place in the FIFA World Ranking, their highest position to date. At the end of the year, the national team played Liechtenstein as a commemoration of the recently deceased Flórián Albert, the only Hungarian football player to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Hungary were drawn in Group D in their 2014 World Cup qualifying, along with the Netherlands, Turkey, Romania, Estonia and Andorra. They amassed 14 points entering the penultimate round of games, but suffered a joint national record defeat 8–1 to the Netherlands, which resulted in the resignation of head coach Sándor Egervári. For their final group game, a 2–0 win against Andorra, Hungary were led by caretaker manager József Csábi. They finished in third place in the group, on 17 points, missing out on qualification.

Attila Pintér was appointed as head coach of the national team in December 2013. Some had seen this decision as controversial, given Pintér&#x27;s low popularity with fans and players alike. The team played their first game at the newly constructed Groupama Arena on 7 September 2014, a 2–1 defeat to Northern Ireland in Euro 2016 qualifying. Pintér was subsequently dismissed, with Pál Dárdai appointed as a temporary replacement for three matches. He turned down an offer to manage the team on a permanent basis, but was kept on.
On 15 November 2015, a Storck-led Hungary qualified for its first European Championship (UEFA Euro 2016) in 44 years and its major tournament in 30 years. Hungary beat Norway in the first leg of the qualifying playoffs 1–0; the only goal was scored by László Kleinheisler. On the return match, Hungary beat Norway 2–1 and qualified for the Euro 2016 finals. After beating Austria 2–0 and drawing with Iceland, Hungary played an exciting 3–3 draw against eventual Euro winners Portugal. Hereupon, Hungary managed to qualify for the round of 16 with a game to spare, marking their best Euro or World Cup performance in over 40 years.

Hungary failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia after finishing outside of the qualification places. Along the way, they drew against the Faroe Islands and were humiliated after being defeated by Andorra 1–0. After failing to qualify, manager Bernd Storck resigned.
On 10 November 2017, Hungary was embarrassed again when they were defeated by Luxembourg 2–1 in a friendly.
On 30 October 2017, Georges Leekens was appointed as a new head coach. Hungary lost both matches in March 2018, the first defeat was another embarrassing one against minnows Kazakhstan (2–3).

On 19 June 2018, after three losses and one draw under his reign, Leekens was let go and Marco Rossi was appointed in his place.

2018–19 UEFA Nations League C saw Hungary drawn with Finland, Greece and Estonia. Hungary had a nearly successful performance, but losses to Finland and Greece shattered their hope to finish in the top of the group. However, UEFA revised the formula aftermath, meaning Hungary was officially promoted to 2020–21 UEFA Nations League B, having finished second before.

The UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying drew a mixed result for the Hungarians. Grouped in group E, they faced Croatia, Wales, Slovakia and Azerbaijan; the former occupied the silver medal in the 2018 FIFA World Cup while the latter was one of 12 host countries in the tournament. Hungary performed successfully against Croatia and Wales at home, obtaining needed victories, as well as successive wins over Azerbaijan. However, two straight defeats to Slovakia and away losses to Croatia and Wales, with the final loss happened when Hungary had a chance to qualify directly, sent Hungary into a disappointing fourth-place finish at the expense of the Welsh who qualified directly instead. However, Hungary was able to obtain a play-off spot, thanked for finishing second in their group at the Nations League, behind Finland, and was scheduled against Bulgaria.

====2020s====

While Hungary could only gain a play-off spot in hope to reach the UEFA Euro 2020, Hungary&#x27;s strong result in previous Nations League gathered more optimism. Hungary began their quest in 2020–21 UEFA Nations League B sharing a group with Russia, Turkey and Serbia. Hungary impressed in their 1–0 victory against host Turkey, Dominik Szoboszlai scoring the game&#x27;s only goal with a 30-meter free kick. However, Hungary faced a setback when Russia, who Hungary had failed to win against since 1978, beat them at home 3–2. A series of good results followed later, with two draws against Russia and Serbia, an important away win over the Serbs in Belgrade, and more importantly, a much needed 2–0 win over Turkey at home. This meant that Hungary was able to gain promotion at the expense of Russia to the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League A.

In October 2020, Hungary participated in the play-offs to qualify for UEFA Euro 2020, where they faced Bulgaria in their first game of the play-off series. After making an away trip to Sofia, Hungary shone with a 3–1 win to reach the final of the play-off to face Iceland a month later, behind closed doors. The team qualified for the tournament winning 2–1, with last-minute strikes from Loïc Nego and Dominik Szoboszlai to take Hungary into the competition despite an earlier mistake by Péter Gulácsi.
With Euro 2020 being postponed to 2021 because of COVID-19, Hungary was drawn in the &quot;group of death&quot; of the tournament. Group F featured Portugal, the defending European champions, France, and Germany. The Hungarians fought against the odds and put on a heroic performance; despite losing 3–0 to Portugal, the Hungarians recorded two points against France and Germany.

2022 again brought the &quot;group of death&quot; for Hungary, as during the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League the team had to face off three former world champions in group A3, Italy, Germany, and England respectively. While prior the matches the team was widely considered to be a key contestant for relegation, the Red-White-Greens quickly proved their worth when they beat Euro 2020 runner-up England 1–0 with a Dominik Szoboszlai penalty an hour into the match. After the victory, expectations were cooled with a 2–1 defeat against Italy in Cesena, nevertheless, an early Zsolt Nagy goal that could only be equalized by Jonas Hofmann resulted in a 1–1 draw against Germany, placing the team second in the group behind Italy. On 14 June, Hungary visited England in Wolverhampton, achieving a stunning 0–4 victory against Gareth Southgate&#x27;s squad, taking the group&#x27;s lead after Italy&#x27;s defeat to Germany. For the last two matchdays, Hungary&#x27;s only chance for relegation were defeats against Germany and Italy, with England winning both of their games. The team was taking no chances though, as Ádám Szalai, the long-time forward who announced his retirement a day before the match, scored a heeler to win the game against Germany 1–0 in Leipzig. On 26 September, Hungary only needed a draw to qualify for the UEFA Nations League Finals, however they lost to Italy 2–0 in the Puskás Aréna.

===Rivalry===

Hungary has a long-standing rivalry with its neighbour Romania. The rivalry dates back to the Treaty of Trianon, where Hungary lost Transylvania to Romania, after World War I. They throw flares and matches between the two sides usually end in a fight between Hungarian and Romanian supporters; however, recently also before the matches conflicts have emerged outside the stadium. This was seen as they shared the same group in qualification for the 1982 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2000, 2002 World Cup, 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016.

The match-up between Austria and Hungary is the second most-played international in football (only Argentina–Uruguay met each other in more matches), although the two teams have only met each other three times since 2000.

===Supporters===
The Carpathian Brigade is an official supporters&#x27; group for the Hungary national football team. The first organized debut of this group was at a Hungary vs. Malta 2010 World Cup qualification match on 1 April 2009 at Ferenc Puskás Stadium. 

The group was officially formed on 15 May 2009. This date has been commemorated as the group&#x27;s birthday ever since, with group members displaying fireworks, pyros and organizing marches every year, to celebrate the birth of the &quot;Brigade&quot;.

Over the early years of the 2010s, the group would establish themselves as a household name on Ferenc Puskás Stadium&#x27;s B-stand, and would acquire a reputation for violence and hooliganism. 

In September 2013, the Carpathian Brigade would dominate Hungarian headlines after clashing with the police, Romanian supporters, and displaying an overall unruly behaviour during an away day to Bucharest prior to a World-Cup qualifier against Romania. In hindsight, this specific tour to Romania is often considered by many as the starting point of the group&#x27;s infamy. 

In October 2014 Hungarian fans travelled to Bucharest en masse to support the national team in their EURO 2016 qualification game. Just like the previous year, crowd trouble and impromptu fights between Hungarian and Romanian fans occurred ahead of and during the game. After being goaded into a fight by the home fans, Hungarian ultras broke the cordon separating the two fanbases, and attempted to enter the romanian sector. The police prevented the fight from escalating into a full-out mass brawl, by using teargas to separate the crowd. The two sets of fans also clashed with the local police force as well. 

In September 2015, Hungary would host Romania for a Euro qualifier in Budapest. On the eve of the match Hungarian fans were looking for Romanians in downtown Budapest, but their effort to fight was spoilt by the police. Prior to the match, members of the Carpathian Brigade attacked the police force and attempted to fight Romanian fans. This would mark one of the most violent days in Hungarian hooligan history. Hungarian ultras hurled beer cans and rocks at the police and threw pyros at a group of Middle Eastern migrants taking refuge at Keleti station. 51 people were detained after the game, four of whom were Romanian. 38 people needed medical help, and six police officers were taken to hospital. Numerous police cars were set on fire, and the outbreak of fighting rendered some trams to temporarily halt functioning. 

Heavy support for the Hungary national team also comes from Transylvania, Slovakia, Vojvodina, Zakarpattia and Western Europe.

===Kits and crest===

Hungary&#x27;s traditional home colours are cherry red shirts, white shorts and green socks. The combination of the colours represent the Hungarian flag. However, the team sometimes wears all white kit even at home. The coat of arms are worn on the left side of the shirt, where the human heart can be found. When the Hungarian players listen to the national anthem of Hungary, &quot;Himnusz&quot;, they usually put their arms on to their chest. The current coat of arms could have always been found on the shirt of the national team in contrast with many other national teams which wear the logo of the football federation. Adidas is currently the designer of the Hungary kits.

==Home stadium==

The home stadium of the Hungary national side is the Puskás Aréna. Formerly, it was the Ferenc Puskás Stadium (also called the Népstadion). The stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. On 23 May 1954, England lost to 7–1 against Hungary. The capacity of the stadium at the end was 35,100 (approved by UEFA) though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium also hosted one of the Derbies of Budapest, including Ferencváros, Újpest, MTK, Honvéd or Vasas. The national team&#x27;s final match played at the stadium was a 3–0 win for Hungary against Kazakhstan on 7 June 2014.

On 19 September 2014, UEFA selected Budapest to host three group stage games and one round of 16 game at Euro 2020.

On 15 November 2019, the Puskás Aréna opened with a match against Uruguay. The idea to invite the Uruguay national football team came from Károly Jankovics, who is the leader of the Hungarian community in Montevideo.

Ferencváros&#x27; Groupama Arena was the temporary home of the national team between 2014 and 2019 during qualification for Euro 2016, the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020.

==Team records==
The match between Austria and Hungary in Vienna in 1902 was the first international match played between two non-British European countries.

Hungary was the first team from outside the United Kingdom and Ireland to beat England at home, famously winning 6–3 at Wembley on 25 November 1953. Six months later they beat England 7–1 in 1954, this time in Budapest. This still ranks as England&#x27;s record defeat.

Gusztáv Sebes holds the highest ratio of victories per game (over 30 matches only) with 72% (49 wins, 12, draws, 7 defeats).

Hungary has the distinction of setting the highest Elo football rating ever achieved by a national side, a high of 2230 in 1954. It was set after Hungary&#x27;s 4–2 victory over Uruguay in the 1954 World Cup semi-final on 30 June 1954, the final match in their 31-game unbeaten streak (see below). Germany and England come in second (2223 in 2014) and third (2212 in 1928) respectively.

The youngest-ever player of the Hungarian national team, József Horváth, is the second youngest scorer of European national teams according the IFFHS.

Ferenc Puskás is recognized to be the top scorer of the 20th century, by the IFFHS.

===Top international goalscorers of the 20th century===
Two of the top six international goalscorers of the 20th century were Hungarian, both of them from the Golden Team of the 1950s.

===Undefeated run===
Hungary was the first team to eclipse an 1888 Scottish record of being undefeated in 22 consecutive matches. They bettered the old mark by nine additional games to 31, now the third-longest unbeaten streak, going undefeated from 14 May 1950 to 4 July 1954, when they lost the World Cup final to West Germany.

Italy holds the longest string at 37 unbeaten matches.

<text>Anna (, &quot;Ḥana&quot;; , &quot;Ánna&quot;), distinguished as Anna the Prophetess, is a woman mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. According to that Gospel, she was an elderly woman of the Tribe of Asher who prophesied about Jesus at the Temple of Jerusalem. She appears in during the presentation of Jesus at the Temple.

==New Testament==
The passage mentioning Anna is as follows:
From these three verses in Luke, the following is known of Anna:
*She was a prophetess.
*She was a daughter of Phanuel.
*She was a member of the tribe of Asher.
*She was widowed after seven years of marriage (her husband is not named).
*She was a devout Asherite Hebrew who regularly practiced prayer and fasting.

Luke describes Anna as &quot;very old&quot;. Many Bibles and older commentaries interpret the New Testament text to state that she was 84 years old.

The Greek text states καὶ αὐτὴ χήρα ὡς ἐτῶν ὀγδοηκοντατεσσάρων, generally translated as &quot;she was a widow of eighty four years&quot;. The passage is ambiguous: it could mean that she was 84 years old, or that she had been a widow for 84 years. Some scholars consider the latter to be the more likely option, in which case she would likely have been around 105 years old.

==Church traditions and veneration ==
The Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church commemorate Anna as a saint, Anna the Prophetess. The Eastern Orthodox Church considers Anna and Simeon the God-Receiver as the last prophets of Old Testament and observes their feast on February 3/February 16 as the synaxis (afterfeast) following the Presentation of Christ, which Orthodox tradition calls &quot;The Meeting of Our Lord and God and Savior, Jesus Christ&quot;. Along with Simeon, the prophetess Anna is commemorated on February 3 in the Byzantine rite of the Catholic Church. 

She is also depicted in icons of the Presentation of Christ, together with the Holy Child and the Virgin Mary, Joseph and Simeon the God-Receiver. Orthodox tradition considers that Christ met his people, Israel, in the persons of Simeon and Anna.

==History==
===Early formation and expansion===
In the last quarter of 1906, Madras (now Chennai) was hit by the worst financial crisis the city was ever to suffer. Of the three best-known British commercial names in 19th-century Madras, one crashed; a second had to be resurrected by a distress sale; and the third had to be bailed out by a benevolent benefactor. Arbuthnot &amp; Co, which failed, was considered the soundest of the three. Parry&#x27;s (now EID Parry), may have been the earliest of them, and Binny and Co.&#x27;s founders may have had the oldest associations with Madras, but it was Arbuthnot, established in 1810s, that was the city&#x27;s strongest commercial organisation in the 19th century. A key figure in the bankruptcy case for Arbuthnot&#x27;s was the Madras lawyer, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer who founded the Indian Bank, which was an offshoot of nationalistic fervour and the Swadeshi movement, when the then British Arbuthnot Bank collapsed and the Indian Bank emerged. Mr V. Krishnaswamy Iyer solicited the support of the Nagarathar Chettiars authored by Mr. Ramasamy Chettiar, who was Annamalai Chettiar&#x27;s elder brother. Sri V. Krishnaswamy Iyer and Mr. Ramasamy Chettiar were one of the first directors of Indian Bank. Later on, in 1915, Mr. Annamalai Chettiar was inducted into the board of the Indian Bank. It commenced operations on 15 August 1907, with its head office in Parry&#x27;s Building, Parry Corner, Madras.

In 1932 IB opened a branch in Colombo. It opened its second branch in Ceylon in 1935 at Jaffna, but closed it in 1939. IB next opened a branch in Rangoon, Burma, in late 1940s. Then in late 1941 IB opened branches in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Penang. The exigencies of war forced IB to close its Singapore and Malayan branches with months. The closing of the Singapore branch resulted in little loss to IB; the loss of the branches in Malaya was much more costly.

World War II resulted in further financial problems for IB and it was forced in 1942 to close a number of its branches in India, and also its branch in Colombo.

===Post Independence of India===
After the war, in 1947, it reopened its branch in Colombo. Indian Bank also reopened its branches in Burma, Malayan and Singapore, the last in 1962. The Burmese government nationalised all foreign banks, including Indian Bank&#x27;s branch, in 1963.

The 1960s saw IB expand domestically as it acquired Rayalaseema Bank (est. 1939), Mannargudi Bank (est. 1932), Bank of Alagapuri, Salem Bank (est. 1925), and Trichy United Bank. Trichy United was the result of the 1965 merger of Woraiyur Commercial Bank (est. 1948), the Palakkarai Bank, and the Tennur Bank (est. 3 March. These were all small banks with, the result that all the acquisitions added only about 38 branches to IB&#x27;s network. Trichy United had five branches and its acquisition in 1967 brought the number of IB branches up to 210.

Then on 19 July 1969, the Government of India nationalised 14 top banks, including Indian Bank. One consequence of the nationalisation was that the Malaysian branches of nationalised Indian banks were forbidden to continue to operate as branches of the parent. At the time, Indian Bank had three branches, and Indian Overseas Bank, and United Commercial Bank had eight between them. In 1973, the three established United Asian Bank Berhad to amalgamate and take over their Malaysian operations. Post-nationalization, Indian Bank was left with only two foreign branches, one in Colombo and the other in Singapore.

International expansion resumed in 1978 with IB becoming a technical adviser to PT Bank Rama in Indonesia, the result of the merger of PT Bank Masyarakat and PT Bank Ramayana. Two years later, IB, Bank of Baroda, and Union Bank of India established IUB International Finance, a licensed deposit taker in Hong Kong. Each of the three banks took an equal share in the joint venture; IB&#x27;s Chairman became the first Chairman of IUB International Finance. In May 1980s, IB also opened a foreign currency unit at its branch in Colombo.

In 1981 IB set up its first Regional Rural Bank, Sri Venkateswara Grameena Bank, in Chittoor.

===Post nationalisation===
In 1983, ethnic sectarian violence in the form of anti-Tamil riots resulted in the burning of Indian Overseas Bank&#x27;s branch in Colombo. Indian Bank, which may have had stronger ties to the Sinhalese population, escaped unscathed.

In 1990, Indian Bank rescued Bank of Tanjore (Bank of Thanjavur; est. 1901), with its 157 branches, based in Tamil Nadu.

A multi-crore scam was exposed in 1992, when then chairman M. Gopalakrishnan lent 13 billion to small corporates and exporters from the south, which the borrowers never repaid.

Bank of Baroda bought out its partners in IUB International Finance in Hong Kong in 1998. Apparently this was a response to regulatory changes following Hong Kong&#x27;s reversion to Chinese control. IUB became Bank of Baroda (Hong Kong), a restricted licence bank.

In June 2015, business of the bank crossed the milestone target of .

===Amalgamation===
On 30 August, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that Allahabad Bank would be merged with Indian bank. The proposed merger would create the seventh largest public sector bank in the country with assets of . The Union Cabinet approved the merger on 4 March 2020. Indian Bank assumed control of Allahabad Bank on 1 April, 2020.

<text>Independence Stadium is a stadium owned by the city of Shreveport, Louisiana and is the home of the Independence Bowl.

Formerly known as State Fair Stadium and Fairgrounds Stadium, it is the site of the annual Independence Bowl post-season college football game, initially (1976) the &quot;Bicentennial Bowl&quot;. Before that, it was the home venue of the Shreveport Steamer of the short-lived World Football League (1974–75). It also served as a neutral site for the annual Arkansas–LSU football rivalry from 1924 to 1936. The 1924 game featured a silver football trophy as part of the dedication ceremonies for the new stadium.

The stadium is also host to numerous high school football games and soccer matches, since many schools in Shreveport lack an on-campus facility. Independence Stadium also hosted the LHSAA state football championship games in 2005 after the Louisiana Superdome suffered heavy damage from Hurricane Katrina.

From 1978 to 1983, Independence Stadium was home to the city&#x27;s two teams in the American Football Association, the Shreveport Steamer (with naming rights purchased from the defunct WFL team) and the Shreveport Americans. It hosted the AFA&#x27;s first championship game, 1978&#x27;s American Bowl I, which the Steamer won 17–14 over the San Antonio Charros.

In 1994–95, Independence Stadium was home to the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League, which was attempting U.S. expansion at the time.

In 2001, Independence Stadium hosted the inaugural year of the annual Port City Classic—an NCAA college football competition featuring Southern University of Baton Rouge—in an effort to revive the old State Fair Classic game. The classic spun-off separately from the fair the following year and became an early September game. Eventually it also hosted a contest between Louisiana Tech University of Ruston and Grambling State University of Grambling.

Independence Stadium was considered as a possible playing site for the New Orleans Saints during the 2005 NFL season due to Hurricane Katrina, but Shreveport eventually lost out to the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas, and Louisiana State University&#x27;s Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge. However, Independence Stadium eventually was chosen to host the Saints&#x27; first preseason home game for the 2006 season while the Louisiana Superdome prepared for its grand re-opening. Field Turf was installed as the stadium&#x27;s playing surface in 2010. It had been natural grass before that from the opening of the stadium.

In 2010, a Texas University Interscholastic League playoff game was played featuring Mesquite Horn high school and the technical host Longview. Longview won, 28–14. The first time Texas teams met in Louisiana for a playoff game was in 2006 when Texas High School from Texarkana topped Dallas Highland Park with quarterback Ryan Mallett. That game also was hosted at Independence Stadium.

The stadium also hosts concerts and other events. The south end zone of the stadium borders Interstate 20.

<doc id="679749" wikidata="Q514989" url="?curid=679749" title="Passenger transport executive">
<text>In the United Kingdom, passenger transport executives (PTEs) are local government bodies which are responsible for public transport within large urban areas. They are accountable to combined authorities, which were created between 2011 and 2016 and took the role of integrated transport authorities (ITAs). The PTEs have joined together to form the Urban Transport Group (Passenger Transport Executive Group (PTEG) until 2016), in which Transport for London and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport also participate.

==History==
===Transport Act 1968===
The first PTEs and Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) were established in the late 1960s by the Transport Act 1968 as transport authorities serving large conurbations, by the then transport minister Barbara Castle. Prior to this, public transport was run by individual local authorities and private companies, with little co-ordination. The PTEs took over municipal bus operations from individual councils, and became responsible for managing local rail networks.

The 1968 Act created five PTE/As. These were:

* West Midlands on 1 October 1969
* SELNEC (South East Lancashire &amp; North East Cheshire) on 1 November 1969 (now &quot;Greater Manchester&quot;)
* Merseyside on 1 December 1969 (now Liverpool City Region)
* Tyneside on 1 January 1970 (now &quot;Tyne and Wear&quot;)
* Greater Glasgow on 1 June 1973 (now &quot;Strathclyde&quot;)

Initially they covered slightly different areas from the ones covered by integrated transport authorities today.

===1970s local government reform===
Local government in England was re-organised in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. The re-organisation created the six metropolitan counties, and the existing four English PTEs were named after, and made to match the borders of the new counties (for example West Midlands PTE was expanded to take on Coventry and Tyneside PTE expanded to include Sunderland becoming Tyne and Wear PTE in the process). In addition to this, two new PTEs were created for the newly established metropolitan counties of South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.

The 1974 reorganisation also abolished the PTAs, and their role was taken over by the Metropolitan county councils (MCCs). However, when the MCCs were abolished in 1986, the PTAs were re-created.

Local government re-organisation in Scotland in 1975 created the region of Strathclyde, and the existing Greater Glasgow PTE was named after, and made to cover the new region.

===Local Government Act 1985===
PTAs were recreated by the Local Government Act 1985 when the metropolitan county councils were abolished.

The Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 had the same effect in the Strathclyde Region.

===Transport Act 1985===
Until the mid-1980s the PTEs operated bus services in their areas, but bus deregulation by the Transport Act 1985 forced them to separate their bus operations into new arms lengths companies. These were called PTC&#x27;s which were all sold off by the mid 1990s. The PTE&#x27;s were also stripped of their powers to regulate the fares and timetables of private bus operators.

===Local Transport Act 2008===
A number of changes to PTE/As were made under the Local Transport Act 2008. The main changes made were:

* Passenger transport authorities (PTAs) have been renamed as integrated transport authorities (ITAs) although PTEs have retained their current names.
* The bill allows for the possibility of new PTEs being created, and for the areas of existing ones to be altered.
* The bill has strengthened the powers of PTEs/ITAs to regulate bus services, and makes ITAs the sole transport planning authorities in their areas.

The integrated transport authorities (ITAs) from 2008 onwards are the bodies which administer the executives; they are made up of councillors representing the areas served by the PTEs. They are responsible for funding the PTEs, and making the policies which the PTEs carry out on their behalf. PTEs secure services on behalf of the ITA but it is the ITA that pays for them.

In the six metropolitan counties, councillors are appointed to the ITAs or the transport committees of combined authorities by the metropolitan boroughs, or in the case of Strathclyde by the twelve unitary authority councils in the area.

The ITAs are not &quot;precepting authorities&quot;, so they have to negotiate a &quot;levy&quot; every year that is applied to council tax collected by the local authorities in the areas that they serve. The executive usually requests a budget and the council representatives on the ITAs negotiate from this position.

It is worth bearing in mind that PTEs do not, strictly speaking, own anything - their role is a statutory one to provide services using the resources provided to them by the ITAs.

==Current structure==
There are currently six passenger transport executives in England, covering areas which correspond - though are not limited - to metropolitan counties. When a combined authority is created the integrated transport area and integrated transport authority are replaced with the combined area and combined authority. This happened in Greater Manchester on 1 April 2011 and happened in three other integrated transport areas from 1 April 2014: to become the larger Liverpool City Region, as well as Sheffield City Region, and West Yorkshire combined areas. In South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and West Midlands, the PTE has been absorbed into the combined authority, and is no longer a separate legal entity; in these areas the combined authority itself is the executive.

===Functions===
* The ITAs are now responsible for subsidising bus services which are not profitable to run but are considered socially necessary, and the PTEs organise this role on their behalf. They are also responsible for providing bus shelters and stations.
* Most PTEs do not operate public transport services. There are a limited number of cases where they do - Liverpool City Region&#x27;s Merseytravel, acting as a &quot;sui generis&quot; authority, leases the franchise to operate its Merseyrail publicly owned railway service, the Tyne and Wear PTE operates the Tyne and Wear Metro, and Strathclyde Passenger Transport operates the Glasgow Subway. In Liverpool City Region, Strathclyde, and Tyne and Wear, some ferry services are operated by the PTEs. In South Yorkshire, the combined authority owns and operates the Supertram system. 
* The PTEs, on the ITAs&#x27; behalf, have retained more powers over local train services, which they do not operate but are responsible for setting fares and timetables of.
* The PTEs are also responsible for planning and funding new public transport facilities, such as light rail systems and new stations.
* They fund concessionary travel schemes for the elderly and disabled including free passes and &quot;Dial-a-Ride&quot; services.
* They are also responsible for giving out travel information about transport services.
* The Transport Act 2000 made the then PTAs (now ITAs) and metropolitan boroughs jointly responsible for producing local transport plans in their areas.

In recent years the PTEs and ITAs have campaigned to be given more powers to regulate local bus services, as is the case in London (see London Buses).

=== Urban Transport Group===
The Passenger Transport Executive Group (PTEG) was a federated body based in Leeds to bring together and promote the interests of the six PTEs in England, plus associate members Strathclyde Partnership for Transport; Transport for London; Nottingham City Council; and Bristol and the West of England.

PTEG&#x27;s main tasks were facilitating the exchange of knowledge and good practice within the PTE network, and raising awareness nationally about the key transport challenges which face the city regions, and the public transport solutions which PTEs are implementing.

PTEG&#x27;s strategy and policy was determined by the Directors General of the PTEs, who met every quarter. It administered a number of specialist task groups which bring together professionals from across the pteg network to focus on specific policy areas and to share expertise and good practice. The PTEG Support Unit, based in Leeds, co-ordinated PTEG&#x27;s activities and acted as a central point of contact.

PTEG became Urban Transport Group in 2018.

==Similar authorities==
===United Kingdom===
In Scotland, the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport, formerly Greater Glasgow Passenger Transport Executive, Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority, covers the former region of Strathclyde, which includes the urban area around Glasgow. All of Scotland is now divided into partnership areas for Transport.

A similar body, Transport for London, exists in Greater London. In shire county areas, similar functions are carried out by county councils.

===Other countries===
* Transit district is a similar type of organisation in the United States.
* In the Czech Republic, integrated public transport systems () have been set up by most regions to facilitate the unification of transport conditions and fare structure across various companies operating public transport in the region under a PSO contract.
* In Germany there are similar types of organisations for the big cities with surroundings, called Verkehrsverbund. They handle both bus and rail bound traffic.
* In Sweden there are similar types of organisations, called Trafikhuvudman (traffic responsible). Every county have to have at least one. All handle bus traffic and most also train traffic, and sometimes boat traffic. For some counties there are separate organisations for train traffic covering several counties.
* In Norway every county has the responsibility of organising local traffic. This is done through a department (9) or through companies (8) which might cover two counties. This always includes bus traffic, and often boat traffic. The actual vehicle operation is done by private companies through PSO contracts. Tram and metro traffic are operated by some cities, but are, ticket-wise, included in the county authority. Railway traffic is maintained by the Norwegian Railway Directorate, but are sometimes included in monthly passes sold by the county authority.
* In France regions or local authorities (communautés de communes, communautés d&#x27;agglomération, communautés urbaines or métropoles) are responsible for transportation as Autorités d&#x27;Organisation de la Mobilité.

<doc id="679751" wikidata="Q199433" url="?curid=679751" title="Coat of arms of Ukraine">
<text>The coat of arms of Ukraine is a blue shield with a golden trident. It is colloquially known as the tryzub (, , ). 

The small coat of arms was officially adopted on 19 February 1992, while constitutional provisions exist for establishing the great coat of arms, which is not yet officially adopted as of March 2024. The small coat of arms was designed by Andriy Grechylo, Oleksii Kokhan, and Ivan Turetskyi. It appears on the presidential standard. Blue-coloured tridents are considered to be an irregular representation by the Ukrainian Heraldry Society. The greater coat of arms which has not been adopted consists of the small coat of arms and the coat of arms of the Zaporizhian Host (Constitution of Ukraine, Article 20).

The trident was not thought of as a national symbol until 1917, when one of the most prominent Ukrainian historians, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, proposed to adopt it as a national symbol (alongside other variants, including an arbalest, a bow or a cossack carrying a musket, i.e. images that carried considerable historical and cultural and heraldic significance for Ukraine). On 25 February 1918, the Central Rada (parliament) adopted it as the coat of arms of the short-lived Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

During the Soviet period of 1919–1991 and independence between 1991 and 1992, the state symbols were consistent with the Russian SFSR and the Soviet Union – a hammer and sickle over the rising sun.

==Description==
The modern &quot;trident&quot; symbol was adopted as the coat of arms of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic in February 1918, designed by Vasyl Krychevsky. The design has precedents in the seals of Kievan Rus&#x27;. The first known archaeological and historical evidence of this symbol can be found on the seals of the Rurik dynasty. However, according to Pritsak, the stylized trident tamga, or seal which was used by rulers such as Sviatoslav I and similar tamgas that were found in ruins are Khazar in origin. 

It was stamped on the gold and silver coins issued by Vladimir the Great (), also known as Volodymyr, who might have inherited the symbol from his ancestors (such as Sviatoslav I) as a dynastic coat of arms, and he passed it on to his sons, Sviatopolk I (1015–1019) and Yaroslav the Wise (1019–54). The symbol was also found on the bricks of the Church of the Tithes in Kyiv, the tiles of the Dormition Cathedral in Volodymyr, and the stones of other churches, castles, and palaces. There are many examples of it used on ceramics, weapons, rings, medallions, seals, and manuscripts.

Historians have multiple interpretations of the origin of the symbol, including a falcon, an arched bow, the Holy Trinity, or an anchor. Depictions of a flying falcon with a Christian cross above its head have been found in Old Ladoga, the first seat of the Kievan Rurik dynasty, of Scandinavian lineage. Such a falcon, along with a cross are also featured on the coins of Olaf Guthfrithsson, a Viking king of Dublin and Northumbria. 

Falconry has been a royal sport in Europe for centuries. The gyrfalcon (known also as &quot;Norwegian falcon&quot;) was considered a royal bird and is mentioned (&quot;ukr.: рарог&quot;) in one of the earliest epics of Ruthenia, the 12th century poem The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign.

Later images of the trident (&quot;tryzub&quot;) among the Rurikids resemble more a bident or the letter &quot;У&quot;, which also in the modern Cyrillic alphabet denotes the sound &quot;u&quot; as in &quot;Ukraine&quot; (though the Cyrillic alphabet at the time did not use this letter individually, using the digraph ОУ/ОѴ or its monogram Ꙋ instead).

=== Color standardization ===
===Other uses===
The Tryzub is heavily used in the military heraldry to commemorate the participation on the Eastern Front during World War II. At least 36 units of the Italian Army carry the Tryzub in their Coat of Arms, as they were awarded a Medal for Military Valor during their service on the territory of Ukraine. The Tryzub is the Coat of arms of Zaslawye. Worth noting is that the Tryzub was also used in conjunction with the Russian tricolour, as the symbol of the anti-communist movement National Alliance of Russian Solidarists in the early 20th century.

===Three-fingered salute===
A three-fingered hand salute is sometimes used to mimic the Tryzub; as for example in pro-independence demonstrations in the late 1980s and in the logo of the (Ukrainian) Svoboda party.

==History==

===Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia===
The coat of arms for the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia, later the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, also known as the Kingdom of Ruthenia, has existed since the 12th century. It consisted of a lion on an azure heater shield. The Ruthenian lion first appears in the seal of the Ruthenian king Yurii I, dated to the beginning of the XIV century. There is an image of a monarch on a throne, and on the reverse, an armed horseman holding a shield with a lion on his hind leg, an example of equestrian seals common in Europe at the time. On the seal, there is an inscription in Latin: &quot;Sigillum Domini Georgi Regis Rusie&quot; (Seal of the owner of George-Yuri, King of Ruthenia), on the back: &quot;Sigillum Domini Georgi Ducis Ladimerie&quot; (seal of the owner of George-Yuri, prince of Lodomeria). 

On the seal of his son Lev II, only a lion without a rider is depicted. The animal stands on its hind legs and reverses to the left.

Figures of lions as symbols of Ruthenia are found on the silver coins of the Lithuanian prince Lubart, the last ruler of the Kingdom of Ruthenia (1340–1383), and his son Fedor (1384–1387). We see the same motive on Ruthenian money, the issue of which continued during the reign in Ruthenia of the Polish king Casimir III (1349–1370), the Hungarian king Louis (1370–1372, 1378–1382) and his governor, Prince of Opole Vladislav (1372–1378).

After the occupation of Eastern Galicia by the Kingdom of Poland as a result of the Galicia–Volhynia Wars, the coat of arms with many changes was adopted as part of the Ruthenian Voivodeship (, Ruthenian Palatine). It was abandoned with partition of Poland and annexation of territory by the Austrian Empire. At the end of World War I and dissolution of Austria-Hungary, the Western Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic revived the coat of arms. With the annexation of the West Ukraine by Poland again in 1918 and later the Soviet Union, the gold lion symbol became the coat of arms for the city of Lviv.
===Cossack Hetmanate===
A Cossack with a musket was an emblem of the Zaporizhian Host and later the state emblem of the Hetmanate and the Ukrainian State. The origin of the emblem is uncertain, while its first records date back to 1592. On the initiative of Pyotr Rumyantsev, the emblem was phased out and replaced by the Russian double-headed eagle in 1767.

A Cossack with a rifle was restored by the Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadsky in 1918. The emblem disappeared until in 2005, when it reappeared on the proposed Great Seal of Ukraine.
====Designs by Heorhiy Narbut====

Designs of the coat of arms of Ukraine by Heorhiy Narbut are projects of the State Coat of Arms of the Ukrainian State and the Great Coat of Arms of the Ukrainian State developed by the Ukrainian artist Heorhiy Narbut in 1918. Heorhiy Narbut took as a basis the national symbols of the hetman state of the Zaporizhzhia Army. On an octagonal blue shield, a Cossack dressed in gold ornamented robes was placed in the center. Above the Cossack&#x27;s shield rose a golden trident, the sign of Grand Duke Volodymyr. The Cossack was turned to the right, and around his shield was a silver cantush, painted in a floral baroque style. The trident gained popularity in the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, because it was depicted on the karbovanets coins introduced in December 1917. The first coin of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was 100 karbovanets. George Narbut used baroque elements and heraldic signs - the trident and coat of arms of the Kyiv Magistrate of the times of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the form of a crossbow. So the trident became a popular symbol and eventually turned into a small coat of arms of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Since January 22, 1919, the Trident was also used as the coat of arms of the Western region of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. It remained the coat of arms of the hetman state of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, as well as the Directorate of Ukraine.

===Grand Duchy of Ruthenia (Archistrategos Mykhaïl)===

The importance of the Kyiv region coat of arms with Archangel Michael known as Archistrategos Mykhaïl arose during discussion of the so-called 1658 treaty of Hadiach between the delegation of the Cossack Hetmanate and the Crown of Poland, that foresaw the transformation of the Commonwealth into the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth. The coat of arms with Archangel Michael is often confused with symbol of the Kyiv City. Note that before the Muscovite annexation of Ukrainian lands in 18th century (see &quot;partitions of Poland&quot;), the city had another symbol which was included by Mykhailo Hrushevsky in his proposal of the Ukrainian coat of arms.


===Carpathian Ruthenia (Red bear)===
The coat of arms was created after the end of the First World War, when Carpathian Ruthenia (then called Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;) was transferred from Hungary to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia. It was designed in 1920 by Czech historian . The Ruthenians had been promised autonomy within the new country, and therefore a coat of arms was created for their land.

The coat of arms shows the Ukrainian tinctures (heraldic colours) of blue and gold in its first (dexter) field and a red bear on silver in its second field. The bear is perhaps a symbol of Carpathian wildlife. The horizontal lines (in heraldry called bars) could perhaps have been inspired by the partitions per fess in the coat of arms of Hungary, to which the territory had belonged.

The arms were also used by the short-lived state of Carpatho-Ukraine in 1939, but with the addition of the Ukrainian Tryzub in the uppermost blue field, used previously by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Since the territory is the same for the current Zakarpattia Oblast, the oblast uses the arms as its own minus the trident.

===Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic===
The coat of arms of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted on 14 March 1919, by the government of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and subsequently modified on 7 November 1928, 30 January 1937, and 21 November 1949. The coat of arms of 1949 is based on the coat of arms of the Soviet Union and features the hammer and sickle with a sunrise on a baroque styled shield crowned with the red star, and having ears of wheat on its outer rims.

The banner bears the Soviet Union state motto (&quot;Workers of the world, unite!&quot;) in both the Ukrainian and Russian languages or Ukrainian only on some editions of the emblem. The name of the union republic was shown as a Russian acronym on the first emblem edition, on the next two editions as a Ukrainian acronym, while the latest edition contained the actual word &quot;Ukrainian&quot;. The latest edition of the emblem was the one crowned with the red star which was not featured on previous editions.

After independence on 24 August 1991, Ukraine retained the Soviet emblem. The next year, in 1992, the emblem was changed to the present coat of arms of Ukraine, the tryzub (trident) coat of arms.

===Other variations===
Among other notable features are Archistratege Michael the Archangel, Pohoń Ruśka (Ruthenian Pursuer), Three crowns (representing three kings Daniel, Leo and George), Galician jackdaw, Volhynian silver cross pattée at the red field, Podolian gold sun, Chernihiv black eagle, Kharkiv crossed cornucopia and caduceus at the green field, Okhtyrka golden cross trefly on at the blue field.

==Greater coat of arms==
In 1917, President of the Central Rada Mykhailo Hrushevsky proposed the Great Coat of Arms in the form of a single shield topped by a dove with olive branch. The shield was split five ways. At its center there was a smaller shield depicting a plough as a symbol of productive peaceful work surrounded by ancient state symbols of Ukraine: the princely arms of Vladimir the Great or Volodymyr the Great (&quot;tryzub&quot;), Litvin Pogon with a golden lion, cossack with musket, the crossbow of Kyiv and the lion of Lviv.

In the current Constitution of Ukraine there is a constitutional provisions for the establishment of a Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine, although it was never officially adopted and was published in various heraldic sources. In this variant, the shield is supported by a lion from the Galician Coat of Arms on the left and a cossack in traditional dress, wielding a musket, the symbol of the Cossack Hetmanate on the right. The Coat of Arms is crowned with the crown of Volodymyr the Great, symbolizing Ukrainian sovereignty and decorated with viburnum and wheat at the bottom.

Since Ukrainian independence in 1991 four attempts by the Ukrainian government to create an official Great Coat of Arms have failed. The official adoption of the Great Coat of Arms has to be endorsed (in a second reading) by a two-thirds majority vote (300 votes) in the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament.

On 25 August 2020 the Verkhovna Rada instructed the Shmyhal Government to get an official Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine adopted in time for the 30th anniversary of Ukrainian independence. On the day of the 30th anniversary of Ukrainian independence, 24 August 2021, the Verkhovna Rada adopted a law in its first reading that establishes an official Great Coat of Arms of Ukraine with 257 votes.

<text>The Romania national football team () represents Romania in men&#x27;s international football, and is administered by the Romanian Football Federation (), also known as FRF. They are colloquially known as &quot;Tricolorii&quot; (&quot;the Tricolours&quot;).

Romania is one of only four national teams from Europe—the other three being Belgium, France, and Yugoslavia—that took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930. Including that participation, Romania has qualified for seven World Cup editions, the latest in 1998. The national team&#x27;s finest hour came in 1994, when led by playmaker Gheorghe Hagi it defeated Argentina 3–2 in the round of 16, before being eliminated by Sweden on a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals. At the European Championships, Romania&#x27;s best performance was in 2000 when they advanced to the quarter-finals from a group with Germany, Portugal, and England, before falling to eventual runners-up Italy. They also reached the last eight in 1960, 1972 and 1984, and have qualified for a total of six tournaments.

==History==

===Early years===

The Romanian Football Federation (&quot;Federația Română de Fotbal&quot;) was established in October 1909 in Bucharest. Romania played their first international match on 8 June 1922, a 2–1 win over Yugoslavia in Belgrade, being coached by Teofil Moraru. Several temporary coaches were employed, before Moraru resumed control in August 1924, managing the side for nearly four years. Romania enjoyed some success during the 1930s; manager Costel Rădulescu took them to the first three FIFA World Cup tournaments, a feat matched only by Brazil, Belgium and France.

====World Cups in the 1930s====
At the 1930 World Cup, Romania won their first match against Peru, 3–1, with goals from Adalbert Deșu, Constantin Stanciu, and Nicolae Kovács and Samuel Zauber as goalkeeper, before losing 4–0 by hosts and eventual winners Uruguay.

Romania qualified for the next World Cup in 1934 after beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a repeat of their first international. At the finals, Romania played only one game in a new knock-out format, losing 2–1 to Czechoslovakia in Trieste, Italy, with Ștefan Dobay scoring their only goal of the tournament.

Romania qualified by default for the 1938 World Cup after their qualifying playoff opponents Egypt withdrew. They suffered a shock defeat in the finals in France, losing to minnows Cuba, who, like Romania, had only qualified due to the withdrawal of their qualifying opponents, the United States. The first match at the Stade du T.O.E.C. in Toulouse ended 3–3 after extra time, but Cuba won the replay four days later 2–1.

====1970 World Cup====
Despite a 3–0 loss to Portugal in Lisbon and two draws against Greece, Romania was able to qualify for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Angelo Niculescu&#x27;s promising side were given the toughest of draws, in Group 3 with 1966 winners England, giants Brazil and Czechoslovakia.

A Geoff Hurst goal gave England a narrow victory in Romania&#x27;s first match at the Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara in what was a very physical game. Chances were improved with a 2–1 win over the Czechs. After going behind early to a Ladislav Petráš goal, Romania turned it around after half-time with Alexandru Neagu and Florea Dumitrache scoring to give them two vital points. Even then, only a win over the Brazilians would take them into the quarter-finals.

There were rumours before the match that Brazil might prefer Romania to progress than world champions England; after beating them 1–0 in their previous match in Guadalajara, the South American giants still viewed England as one of its biggest obstacles to tournament victory. But Brazil played some of the best football of the competition, with Pelé scoring twice and a Jairzinho goal in between. Romania battled bravely; Dumitrache pulled the score back to 2–1 before the break and a late Emerich Dembrowski goal made it 3–2, but they were out.

====1972 to 1978====

On 26 September 1972, under new coach Valentin Stanescu, Romania suffered a significant defeat to East Germany in Leipzig. The East Germans won 2–0 to effectively seal their first ever qualification for the World Cup, which would be held over the border in West Germany. With East Germany scoring a predictable 4–1 win in Albania, Romania were out, despite a huge 9–0 win over Finland in Bucharest.

Romania continued to suffer poor form in the UEFA European Championship. In their qualifying group for the 1976 European Football Championship, they were out-qualified by Spain despite an impressive 1–1 draw in the away match. Romania failed to win matches, drawing twice with Scotland and Spain and dropping points in Denmark with a dismal goalless draw.

Romania were again beaten by Spain for a place in the 1978 World Cup in Argentina. After a 1–0 win in Bucharest, Romania lost a match at home to Yugoslavia 6–4 having led 3–2 at half time. Spain won 1–0 in Belgrade to seal passage to Argentina.

====1984 European Championship====

Romania&#x27;s sole successful qualifying campaign between 1970 and 1990 was for the European Championships in 1984 in France. At the finals, Romania were drawn with Spain, holders West Germany and Portugal. Under head coach Mircea Lucescu, an encouraging opening game in Saint-Étienne saw them draw with the Spanish. Francisco José Carrasco opened the scoring from the penalty spot but Romania equalized before half-time with a goal from Laszlo Bölöni.

Against the Germans in Lens, Marcel Coraș scored an equalizer in the first minute of the second half in response to Rudi Völler&#x27;s opener, but Völler would score a winning goal. Their last match in Nantes was a must-win match, but Nené&#x27;s late winner meant Portugal progressed with Spain, who netted a dramatic late winner against West Germany at the Parc des Princes in Paris.

Romania stuttered throughout the rest of the decade, but a stronger squad at the end of the decade saw them qualify for their fifth World Cup in 1990. A win over Denmark in their last match took Emerich Jenei&#x27;s side to the finals for the first time in 20 years.

===Golden Team era===

====1990 World Cup====

With an increasing trend for big clubs in Italy and Spain buying up the best foreign talent, Romania&#x27;s squad was entirely domestic-based. Midfielder Ilie Dumitrescu, striker Florin Răducioiu and genius playmaker Gheorghe Hagi, were in the squad. After world champions Argentina were stunned by Cameroon in the tournament&#x27;s opening match, Romania did their chances no harm with a convincing win over the Soviet Union at the San Nicola in Bari, with Marius Lăcătuș scoring in each half. The result was all the more impressive given the absence of Hagi. There was controversy, however, as Lăcătus&#x27; second was a penalty given for a handball by Vagiz Khidiatullin that television replays clearly showed to be some way outside the penalty area.

Romania lost to Cameroon next; cult hero Roger Milla, aged 38, came on as a substitute for Emmanuel Maboang Kessack and scored twice before Gavril Balint pulled one back. Romania needed a point in their last match against improving Argentina at the San Paolo in Naples; Pedro Monzón gave Argentina the lead after an hour, but Balint quickly equalized and Romania held on to reach the second round.

Against Jack Charlton&#x27;s Republic of Ireland side in Genoa, Romania did not have the quality to break down a defensive opposition. Daniel Timofte was the only player to miss in the penalty shoot-out – his kick saved by Packie Bonner – and Romania were out.

====1994 World Cup====

Romania missed out on Euro 1992. Scotland qualified after Romania drew a must-win last match in Sofia against Bulgaria, with Nasko Sirakov&#x27;s equalizer sealing their fate.

Romania was successful, however, in reaching another World Cup in the United States in 1994. After losing in Belgium and suffering a heavy 5–2 defeat in Czechoslovakia, Romania went into their last match at Cardiff Arms Park with Wales needing a win to pip them to a place in the finals. Goals from Gheorghe Hagi and Dean Saunders meant the game was finely balanced, before Wales were awarded a penalty. Paul Bodin of Swindon Town stepped up but hit the woodwork and Romania went on to win 2–1, Florin Răducioiu&#x27;s late goal proving unnecessary as Czechoslovakia dropped a point in Belgium and were eliminated.

At the finals, Romania were one of the most entertaining teams in the early stages, with Gheorghe Hagi, Florin Răducioiu and Ilie Dumitrescu on form. Romania beat Colombia 3–1 at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in Los Angeles (all but one of Romania&#x27;s games took place in California, and they were awarded the advantage of playing most of their games in LA). Răducioiu opened the scoring before Hagi scored a spectacular second from wide on the left touchline. Adolfo Valencia pulled one back with a headed goal just before half-time, but Romania held on and Răducioiu sealed the win with a late third.

In Detroit&#x27;s indoor Pontiac Silverdome, the temperature soared due to the greenhouse effect in the indoor arena. Switzerland, acclimatized after having already played the hosts there, outran Romania in the second half and turned a 1–1 half time score into a 4–1 win. Romania responded by beating the hosts 1–0 in Pasadena with an early Dan Petrescu goal.

In the Round of 16 knockout stage they faced Argentina, minus Diego Maradona who had been thrown out of the tournament for taking drugs, in Los Angeles. The suspended Răducioiu was hardly missed, as coach Anghel Iordănescu pushed Dumitrescu forward to play as a striker and the player responded by scoring twice in the first 20 minutes, one a subtle left foot flick from a right-wing Hagi cross slotted between the Argentine defenders. In between, Gabriel Batistuta scored a penalty, but after half-time Romania netted a third on the counterattack, with Hagi beating goalkeeper Luis Islas. Abel Balbo pulled one back, but Romania held on for a shock win.

Romania would suffer penalty heartbreak again in the quarter-final against Sweden in San Francisco. With just 13 minutes to play, a tight match opened up as Sweden&#x27;s Tomas Brolin scored from a clever free-kick move, the ball passed outside the Romanian wall by Håkan Mild for Brolin to smash in. Iordănescu threw caution to the wind and the returning Răducioiu found a late equalizer, again from a free-kick move but this time down to a deflection and a failure of the Swedes to clear. In extra time Răducioiu scored again after a mistake by Patrik Andersson, but Sweden then scored their own late equalizer as giant striker Kennet Andersson climbed above goalkeeper Florin Prunea to head home a long ball. Prunea had come in after two matches to replace Bogdan Stelea, whose confidence was shattered by the 4–1 loss to the Swiss. In the shoot-out, Dan Petrescu and Miodrag Belodedici had their kicks saved by Thomas Ravelli and Sweden went through.

====Euro 1996====
At Euro 1996, held in England, Romania arrived as a highly thought-of and popular team but had a nightmare. Iordănescu&#x27;s side were based in the northeast, with their first two games at St James&#x27; Park in Newcastle. Against France, they lost to a Christophe Dugarry header reminiscent of Kennet Andersson&#x27;s two years earlier, beating the goalkeeper to a lofted through ball. An early goal from Bulgaria striker Hristo Stoichkov at St James&#x27; Park put Romania on the back foot in Euro 1996, but Dorinel Munteanu appeared to have kept Romania in the match – and in the tournament – with a thunderbolt that hit the bar, bounced over the line, and back out. Referee Peter Mikkelsen merely waved play on, however, and Romania went on to lose the game 1–0, a defeat which sent them out of the tournament.

====1998 World Cup====
Despite a poor performance at Euro 1996, Romania impressed in qualifying, finishing ten points clear of the Republic of Ireland and were seeded for the final tournament of the 1998 World Cup.

Adrian Ilie scored the only goal with a fine chip in their first match against Colombia at Lyon&#x27;s Stade Gerland. In Toulouse, they met an England side starting with prodigal striker Michael Owen on the bench, with Teddy Sheringham preferred alongside Alan Shearer. A mistake by Tony Adams was punished by Viorel Moldovan, who played for Coventry City, before Owen came on to claim an equalizer. But Romania won with a wonderful late goal from Dan Petrescu, also playing in England with Chelsea, fighting off his club teammate Graeme le Saux and nutmegging goalkeeper David Seaman.

The next match was against a Tunisia side eliminated after losing to both England and Colombia. With England–Colombia being the more decisive game, the Stade de France in Paris was an 80,000-strong sell out and the crowd were nearly rewarded with a shock as Skander Souayah scored an early penalty to give the north Africans the lead. Romania needed a point to win the group and avoid Argentina in the round of 16, and got it when Moldovan volleyed a late equalizer. It did them little good, however, as in the round of 16 match at Bordeaux against Croatia, Davor Šuker scored a twice-taken penalty to eliminate Romania.

====Euro 2000====

Romania had a strong qualifying campaign, winning a tough Group 7 with Portugal, Slovakia, Hungary, Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein. The Romanians impressed, never losing and winning seven times, including a big upset in Porto after defeating Portugal thanks to a late goal scored by Dorinel Munteanu. In Bucharest, the score finished 1–1.

At Euro 2000, held in Belgium and the Netherlands, Romania were drawn against 1996 champions Germany, semi-finalists England and Portugal. The chances for the Romanians to qualify through quarter-finals were seen as slim.

Romania, however, started brightly against the Germans in Liège, with Viorel Moldovan scoring from close range. A long-range Mehmet Scholl equalizer meant they had to be content with a point and their position looked shaky after Costinha headed a last minute winner for Portugal in their second match.

Emerich Jenei, back as coach, threw caution to the wind in the last match in Charleroi against England, a must-win match for Romania. Defender Cristian Chivu&#x27;s cross went in off the post in the 22nd minute, but despite Romania dominating, England led at half-time through an Alan Shearer penalty and a late Michael Owen goal after he rounded goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea to score a tap-in, both in the last five minutes of the half. Romania attacked after the break and were quickly rewarded; Dorinel Munteanu punishing a poor punch from Nigel Martyn, a late replacement for injured goalkeeper David Seaman, to equalize three minutes after the restart. England cracked under the pressure. Unable to retain possession or pose an attacking threat, they fell deep and late on Phil Neville, playing out of position at left-back, conceded a penalty scored by Ioan Ganea in the 89th minute.

Romania&#x27;s relief was tempered by tough opposition in the last eight, and Italy, who would end up seconds from being crowned European champions in an agonizing final, comfortably saw them off 2–0 in Brussels. Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi scoring towards the end of the first half. In the 35th minute, Gheorghe Hagi, in his final international tournament, hit the woodwork with goalkeeper Francesco Toldo stranded off his line and, after the break, was sent off for diving. Romania&#x27;s tournament was over and Emerich Jenei left his job as coach again.

===2000s – World Cup dry spell===
Romania failed to qualify for the next three major tournaments. They drew Slovenia, who had been surprise qualifiers for Euro 2000 in a playoff for a place in the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan. A narrow 2–1 deficit – having led through a Marius Niculae goal – after the first leg in Ljubljana was not irretrievable. With fan hero Gheorghe Hagi now coaching the side, they were confident of getting the win they needed in Bucharest against the Balkan upstarts, but Slovenia took the lead before the hour through Mladen Rudonja. Right wing-back Cosmin Contra quickly equalized but Romania could not find the goal they needed to force extra time and Slovenia, with maverick manager Srečko Katanec, were in a major tournament again.

====Euro 2004====
Romania were confident of qualifying for the tournament, drawn in Group 2 with seeds Denmark, Norway, Bosnia and Herzegovina and minnows Luxembourg, with Anghel Iordănescu back as coach. Despite a good start – a 3–0 win away to Bosnia in Sarajevo – Romania stuttered. Steffen Iversen&#x27;s late goal gave Norway a surprise win in Bucharest and they were stunned at home by the Danes, 5–2, with Thomas Gravesen scoring a spectacular goal from around 50 yards out, after leading twice. They recovered slightly, completing a double over the Bosnians and earning a point in Oslo, but conceded a cutting injury time equalizer in Denmark to draw 2–2. It was decisive, as they now required Norway to fail to win at home to Luxembourg to stand any realistic chance of qualifying. Eventually, the Danes got a point in Bosnia to scrape through a tight group, with Norway going to a play-off with Spain.

====2006 World Cup====
Romania were drawn with the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, who were ranked first and second in Europe respectively in 2006 World Cup qualification. Early wins over Finland and Macedonia were unconvincing, and they were behind the two leaders by the time they earned a 2–0 home win over the Czechs. Despite a record of eight wins, three losses and one draw, they finished third behind the Dutch and the Czechs and missed out on another major tournament.

====Euro 2008====
Romania were drawn in a group with the Netherlands again, along with Bulgaria for Euro 2008 qualifying. Romania, however, performed well, losing only away against Bulgaria and beating the Netherlands 1–0 at home with a goal scored by Dorin Goian from a suspicious offside position not seen by referee Kyros Vassaras. On 17 October 2007, Romania became the fourth team to qualify for Euro 2008, the nation&#x27;s first international tournament since Euro 2000. Coincidentally, Victor Pițurcă also led Romania to qualification for Euro 2000, only to sit back and let Emerich Jenei coach the team in the final tournament; this time, however, he stayed in the role, the first time he coached a national team in the final stages of a tournament.

Romania was drawn in the so-called &quot;Group of death&quot; alongside the Netherlands, world champions Italy and France, runners-up in the 2006 World Cup. Romania started with a 0–0 draw against a lacklustre France while Italy were soundly beaten by the Netherlands, 3–0. In their next match, against Italy, Adrian Mutu opened the scoring early in the second half. Their lead was a very short one, however, as Italy&#x27;s Christian Panucci scored a minute later off of a corner kick. Nearing the end of the match, Daniel Niculae earned a penalty for his team, but goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon saved the subsequent Mutu penalty, leaving Romania with two points and needing a win against the Netherlands, who defeated France 4–1 that same evening. The Netherlands beat Romania 2–0 in the final game of the group, which meant that Italy joined the Netherlands in the quarter-finals and Romania finished third, ahead of France.

==== 2010 World Cup ====

Romania were drawn into the UEFA qualifying round for the 2010 World Cup alongside France, Serbia, Austria, Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. Although Romania were seeded in the second pot, they eventually finished fifth, above only the Faroe Islands. Their campaign was a disaster that began with a 3–0 home loss to Lithuania and included a 5–0 trashing in Belgrade by Serbia. Furthermore, various problems were caused during the poor campaign, such as the retirement from international football of Cosmin Contra, Mirel Rădoi and Adrian Mutu (the latter would later be recalled after a year&#x27;s absence). Coach Victor Pițurcă resigned and was replaced by Răzvan Lucescu.

====Euro 2012====
In Euro 2012 qualifying, Romania was drawn into Group D along with France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, Albania and Luxembourg. Although the team initially seemed prepared to continue their awful form from their disastrous World Cup campaign, beginning with a 1–1 draw with Pot 5 members Albania and following up with a goalless draw with Belarus and a pair of losses to France and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the team was able to rebound somewhat and register their first two victories. The first was a win against Luxembourg and the second was an important win in the rematch against Bosnia and Herzegovina. Romania&#x27;s last decent result came when they battled France to a goalless draw before ending the campaign the way it began – two disappointing draws with Albania and Belarus. They finished qualification in a distant third place and only one point ahead of Belarus.

====2014 World Cup====
Romania were drawn into the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying round with the Netherlands, Turkey, Hungary, Estonia and Andorra. They made an impressive start with a 2–0 away win in Estonia followed by a 4–0 win at home against modest Andorra and another away win in Turkey (1–0). After that, Romania were defeated by the Netherlands, both at home and away, and managed to secure only a draw in Hungary, in between. Romania started the last part of the campaign with a victory at home, against Hungary, but was defeated by Turkey. The last two match days were decisive, with Romania securing its place in the play-off with two wins, against Andorra and Estonia, while qualification rivals Turkey and Hungary were both defeated by the winner of the group, the Netherlands. Romania were drawn to play Greece for a place in the World Cup finals, but a 3–1 loss in Greece and a 1–1 home draw ended its run.

====UEFA Euro 2016====
For the qualifying stage of the Euro 2016 Romania was drawn into Group F along with Greece, Hungary, Finland, Northern Ireland and the Faroe Islands. Romania began its first successful qualification campaign since 2008 with a win over Greece before following up with a 1–1 draw with Pot 2 team Hungary and a 2–0 win over Finland. Despite the initial success, Romania decided to part with coach Victor Pițurcă by mutual consent. Anghel Iordănescu came out of retirement to return to coach Romania for a third time.

Under Iordănescu, Romania was able to follow up with comfortable 2–0 win over Northern Ireland and, despite a disappointing 1–0 win over the Faroe Islands and a 0–0 draw in the return game against Northern Ireland, Romania remained on top of Group F, one point above Northern Ireland and three points above third-placed Hungary. After a goalless draw in the match against Hungary in Budapest, however, the team fell back on the second place, one point behind Northern Ireland and three above Hungary, still placed third. Following a 1–1 draw clinched in overtime at home against Finland, Romania secured their spot at the final tournament in the last game after a confident 3–0 win in the Faroe Islands. Romania finished the qualification group second, one point behind group winners Northern Ireland, completing their first successful qualification campaign in eight years undefeated after five wins and five draws. With only two goals conceded, Romania had the best defence in the qualifiers.

Romania advanced to Euro 2016, where they were drawn in Group A, being named to play the opening match against the hosts France. The match began better for the Romanian side, who almost scored the first goal of the tournament in the fourth minute, after Bogdan Stancu tricked the French defence at a corner kick executed by his co-national Nicușor Stanciu and his shot was narrowly saved by the French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. Shortly after the half-time, France dominated, and scored the first goal of the tournament after a header by Olivier Giroud in the 57th minute. Less than eight minutes later, Nicușor Stanciu was fouled by Patrice Evra in the French box, and Hungarian referee Viktor Kassai gave Romania a penalty which Bogdan Stancu scored. With the match coming to an end, just after Romania narrowly missed an opportunity after a free kick, Dimitri Payet shot hard from outside the box and scored France&#x27;s second goal, crushing Romania&#x27;s dream of a perfect start in the Euros.

In the second match, Romania faced Switzerland, in a match that began with the Swiss side dominating. In the 17th minute, Alexandru Chipciu was fouled in the box, the second penalty of the tournament being accorded again to Romania. The same Bogdan Stancu went on and scored, giving an advantage for the Romanian side. Just after Switzerland almost scored an own goal, Admir Mehmedi scored for an equalizer in the 57th minute. The match eventually finished in a 1–1 draw.

With one point accumulated and on the third place in the group before the final match, Romania needed a victory against Albania in order to be among the first four best-third-placed teams and to qualify further in Euro. The match began good for the Romanian side, but Armando Sadiku&#x27;s header in the 43rd minute went past Ciprian Tătărușanu, giving Albania the lead and their first ever goal in a tournament. The despondent Romanian side failed to score in this match, with Florin Andone striking the post in the 76th minute. The negative score meant that Romania ended on the last place of the group, ending their Euro dream with no victory and after one draw, two defeats, two goals scored (both from penalties) and four conceded, with only one point, the poor results making the manager Anghel Iordănescu to resign before the matches for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers began three months later.

====2018 FIFA World Cup qualification====
It was German manager Christoph Daum who took the place of Anghel Iordănescu for the next qualifying campaign. Due to FIFA&#x27;s ranking revamp, Romania was drawn from Pot 1, having to face Denmark, Poland, Montenegro, Armenia and Kazakhstan. The campaign began with a mediocre 1-1 draw against Montenegro in Cluj-Napoca, followed by a thrashing 5-0 victory in Yerevan against Armenia before another mediocre draw in Astana against Kazakhstan, a 0-3 defeat in Bucharest and a 1-3 defeat in Warsaw against Poland, a lacklustre 0-0 draw against Denmark in Cluj-Napoca and a lucky victory in the last minutes against Armenia in Bucharest.

With only nine points after seven fixtures, Romania had to win against the revelation of the group, Montenegro, in Podgorica, but failed amid a Stevan Jovetić winner and were mathematically eliminated, leading to the sacking of Daum and his replace with Cosmin Contra. This defeat was followed by a 3-1 victory against Kazakhstan in Ploiești before a lucky 1-1 draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. Romania ended fourth in the group, with 13 points, twelve goals scored and ten conceded.

====UEFA Nations League 2018-19====
The poor performance in the qualifiers meant Romania would be in the League C of UEFA&#x27;s first season of the new competition, the Nations League. They were drawn against neighbours Serbia, Montenegro again and Baltic side Lithuania.

In the first match, Romania registered yet another mediocre result against Montenegro, in a 0-0 draw in Ploiești, before a double comeback in Serbia in a 2-2 draw and a late-winner in Vilnius against Lithuania. This was followed by another 0-0 draw in Bucharest against Serbia, in which Dušan Tadić missed a penalty and a comfortable 3-0 victory over Lithuania in Ploiești.

Overall results meant that it was possible for Romania to win the group shall it win in Podgorica against Montenegro and Serbia lose to Lithuania in Belgrade. Despite Romania actually emerging victorious from the duel against the Montenegrins, Serbia comfortably won against Lithuania and won the group. However, following UEFA&#x27;s revamp of the competition, Romania, as the second place, promoted too in League B for the next edition.

====UEFA Euro 2020 qualification====

For the qualifiers of Euro 2020, Romania was drawn in a group including Spain, Sweden, and Norway alongside Malta and the Faroe Islands. In the opening game, Romania suffered a 1–2 defeat to Sweden in Stockholm, followed by a comfortable 4–1 victory over the Faroe Islands in Cluj-Napoca and a 2–2 draw with Norway in Oslo, with Claudiu Keșerü scoring in the last minute.

Eventually, Romania stayed on track by defeating Malta in a 4-0 victory in Valletta, but it was later followed by a defeat to Spain in Bucharest, with two very late misses from George Pușcaș and Dragoș Grigore, and a poor 1-0 victory against Malta. This meant Romania had to win against Norway in October, but after a goal from Alexandru Mitriță in the 62nd minute, Alexander Sørloth scored in the last minute and the match in Bucharest ended 1-1. This had significantly reduced their chances of automatic qualification, as they had to meet the Swedish and Spanish sides for the two remaining competitive games.

A 0–2 defeat to Sweden in Bucharest ensured Romania&#x27;s fail to finish on any of the automatic qualification places. In the last matchday, they were thrashed by Spain in Madrid in a 0-5 defeat, meaning they would end the campaign with seventeen goals scored but also fifteen conceded. Due to the revamp of the previous Nations League and poor performance of Greece, Romania managed to grab the last spot for UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs, and was drawn in Path A. Shall it had won it, Romania would have been drawn in Group C of the final tournament, but it did not, Iceland winning in Reykjavík and eliminating them. Their performance cost Cosmin Contra his coaching position, as he was changed with Mirel Rădoi before the play-offs.

====UEFA Nations League 2020-21====
For the second Nations League edition, Romania was drawn against Austria, Norway and Northern Ireland. A very lacklustre 1-1 draw against Northern Ireland in the first matchday was followed by an impressing 3-2 victory over Austria in Klagenfurt am Wörthersee. This meant that, after the first two matchdays, Romania was on the first place and supposed to promote to League A, but a 0-4 defeat to Norway in Oslo and a 0-1 defeat to Austria on homesoil meant Romania would fall back on the third place before the last two matches.

For the home match against Norway, the Romanians were given a 3-0 victory from UEFA after the impossibility of Norwegians to travel to Bucharest, following Omar Elabdellaoui&#x27;s positive test for COVID-19 and the restrictive measures imposed by the Norwegian Ministry of Health. Another 1-1 draw against Northern Ireland in Belfast meant Romania would end on the third position and remain in League B.

====2022 FIFA World Cup qualification====
Following an acceptable Nations League campaign, Romania was drawn from Pot 2 in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, in a group with Germany, Euro 2016 revelation Iceland who eliminated them from UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs two months prior, future revelation North Macedonia, Armenia again and Liechtenstein. In their first match, Romania managed a hard victory over North Macedonia in Bucharest after two quick Macedonian goals and a late winner from Ianis Hagi. Three days later, Germany managed a victory over them on the same stadium despite a huge opportunity from Nicolae Stanciu in the last minutes. This was followed by a shameful 2-3 defeat to Armenia in Yerevan.

Poor performance in the June friendlies, combined with the results so far gave the feeling of another poor World Cup campaign, just like last time, before a shocking 2-0 victory over Iceland in Reykjavík, followed by a mediocre 2-0 victory over Liechtenstein and a 0-0 draw in Skopje against North Macedonia. Initial group revelation Armenia fell behind in the following matches and it was Romania and North Macedonia who&#x27;d fight for the second place, but despite a heroic defeat to Germany, in which Romania held the lead for almost an hour, and a victory over Armenia in Bucharest, a 0-0 draw against Iceland meant that Romania would depend on Iceland to hold a draw against North Macedonia in the last matchday. North Macedonia won, however, and went over Romania by a single point, eliminating them from another campaign.

====UEFA Nations League 2022-23====
Romania was drawn from Pot 3 in the UEFA Nations League season 2022-23, in a group against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Finland and Montenegro. In a similar scenario like five years prior, Montenegro comfortably won against Romania 2-0 in Podgorica, which was then followed by another defeat, to Bosnia and Herzegovina in Zenica and a lacklustre victory over Finland in Bucharest.

With little to nothing achieved so far, Romania was crushed by Montenegro in Bucharest in a 0-3 defeat, meaning that chances to retain the place in League B were dim. A 1-1 draw against Finland in Helsinki meant Romania was again at the expense of other team, this time Montenegro, who needed not to lose against Finland, which eventually happened despite Romania&#x27;s comfortable victory over eventual group winners Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, Romania relegated to League C for the next Nations League edition.

==== UEFA Euro 2024 ====
The terrible Nations League performance meant Romania would be drawn from Pot 3 in Euro 2024 qualifiers, which led them to a group with Switzerland, Israel, Kosovo, Belarus and Andorra. Two initial victories against Andorra and Belarus in Bucharest, followed by a lacklustre 0-0 against Kosovo in Pristina gave the impression of another despondent campaign before a shocking comeback against Switzerland in Lucerne, Valentin Mihăilă scoring a brace in the last three minutes. This was then followed by a 1-1 draw against Israel in Bucharest before a controversial match against Kosovo; the match was interrupted for almost an hour after Romanian fans began chastising Kosovar players and chanting anti-NATO chants, with the Kosovars leaving the pitch in protest. Two late goals for Romania after the match restarted, a draw against Belarus on neutral pitch because of their involvement with the Russian military operations in Ukraine and a comfortable victory over Andorra meant Romania had to obtain a single point in the ninth matchday in order to mathematically qualify for Euro 2024.

In the ninth matchday. Romania faced a tired Israeli side, who had to play four games in nine days because of the Israel-Palestine war, on neutral pitch. Eran Zahavi stunned Romania in the 88th second of the match before George Pușcaș scored an equalizer eight minutes later. One hour in the match, Ianis Hagi assured Romania&#x27;s qualification to Euro 2024 with a goal that meant Romania would win 2-1 over Israel. Moreover, Romania went on and won against Switzerland in Bucharest too, meaning they would win the group and be drawn from Pot 2 at the final tournament, in a heroic act of the Tricolours.

At the final tournament, Romania was drawn against Belgium, Slovakia and neighbours Ukraine in Group E. In the first matchday, Romania met Ukraine in Munich, and achieved their best result in the European Championship final tournament: a Nicolae Stanciu screamer that came in as the fourth most beautiful goal of the tournament, a long shot from Răzvan Marin and a tap-in from Denis Drăguș gave Romania a 3-0 victory after not playing in an international tournament for eight years. The victory was only the second victory of Romania at a European Championship, the first and only other one being against England in 2000 in a 3-2 with a last minute winner. Following this performance, in the second matchday, Romania was stunned by Youri Tielemans of Belgium in the 74th second, and despite putting a decent fight, lost the match 0-2, Kevin De Bruyne scoring a controversial goal in the final minutes.

All the four teams had the same amount of points at the end of the second matchday, three, but because of the overall goal difference, Romania was on the first position at this point, with three goals scored and a +1 difference. In the third matchday, Slovakia and Romania drew in a comfortable match as both teams assured qualification at that score, as neither Ukraine or Belgium managed to win the other match. With the table unchanged from the second matchday, Romania was crowned as the group winner despite all the teams ending with four points, having a victory against fourth place Ukraine, a better goal difference than third place Slovakia and more goals scored than second place Belgium.

In the Round of 16, Romania returned to Munich and faced the Netherlands. Despite a good start, Cody Gakpo stunned the Tricolours in the 20th minute, before Donyell Malen&#x27;s brace in the last minutes. Despite losing 0-3 against the Dutch side and leaving the tournament relatively early, Romania&#x27;s performance was praised by numerous figures of the football world, achieving a very good result for the overall level of the national team.

===Rivalries===
==== Rivalry against Hungary ====
Romania&#x27;s most fierce rivalry is against their neighbours Hungary. The reason for the rivalry are the general feelings for the other country, as Hungary and Romania have a long-standing dispute over certain parts of Romania that were historically part of Hungary, most well-known being Transylvania. This has been the subject of the constant squabble between Hungarian and Romanian fans during the direct matches of the two countries or clubs from them.

The first match between the two countries took place in Bucharest, on October 4, 1936. Romania initially took the lead through Silviu Bindea, but two goals in the second half scored by Gyula Lázár and Géza Toldi led to Hungary&#x27;s victory. At that moment, Hungary was, if not the best, among the best teams on the planet, and after this result, impressive results of the Hungarians were obtained during their matches against Romania, most notably the worst defeat of Romania to date, a 0-9 defeat in Budapest on June 6, 1948. Other notable Hungarian victories include the 7-2 on September 30, 1945, two 5-1&#x27;s, one in Bucharest on October 24, 1948 and one in Budapest on September 19, 1954, and a 3-0 in Bucharest on October 12, 1947.

Romania&#x27;s first victory against Hungary came almost 63 years after the first match, in the seventeenth derby overall. Romania won 2-0 in Bucharest on June 5, 1999, in the qualifying stage of UEFA Euro 2000. Since then, Hungary has yet to defeat Romania again, and Romania won five more times, including a notable 3-0 in the qualifying stage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

Due to the general antipathy between the two peoples, derbies often led to skirmishes between the two fans. The worst incidents were recorded on September 6, 2013 and October 11, 2014, during the derbies of the two countries in Bucharest for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2016, respectively. During the first match, Hungarians lit many flames, booed the Romanian anthem, and after the 0-3 defeat were quickly transported back home, not before some of them fought with Romanian fans in the Old Town of Bucharest. After Romania&#x27;s elimination in the Second Round by Greece, many Hungarians thanked Greeks and publicly insulted Romania on their social media accounts. One year later, the fights between the two groups of fans led to 58 people seeking medical care after Romanian fans jumped the fence separating their sector from the one Hungarian fans were in and attacked them. The match ended 1-1 and fights were again commenced in the Old Town, where many terraces of the local coffee shops and bars were destroyed by Hungarian fans.

Notable opportunities when the two teams have met include: the football tournament of the 1952 Summer Olympics, the qualifying stages for UEFA Euro 1972, 2000 and 2016 and the qualifying stages for the FIFA World Cups of 1982, 2002 and 2014.

==== Rivalry against Greece ====
A notable rivalry was built with Greece, as it is the team Romania has met the most times: thirty-six (Romania met Yugoslavia thirty-seven times, a record which was annulled after the dismantle of Yugoslavia). Out of all the matches overall, Romania won eighteen of them, dominating the rivalry. Greece won an additional eight matches and ten ended in a draw.

The only notable opportunity the two teams have met was in the Second Round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, to which Greece qualifying after defeating Romania in a two-legged play-off, winning 3-1 in Athens and drawing 1-1 in Bucharest.

==== Minor rivalries ====

===== Montenegro =====
In the last period, a small rivalry was built against Montenegro. The two teams met a total of seven times, and Romania&#x27;s 4-0 victory in a friendly on May 31, 2008 was Montenegro&#x27;s biggest defeat up to a 0-7 defeat in London in 2019. The teams met in the qualifying stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and it was Montenegro who eliminated Romania after a 1-0 victory in Podgorica which came after a 1-1 draw on Romanian soil. The two teams met again one year later, in Group 4 of League C of the inaugural season of the UEFA Nations League. Romania avenged itself with a 1-0 victory in Podgorica, which was not enough however to win the group over mutual neighbour Serbia. In the third edition of the same competition, the two teams met again, this time Montenegro decimating Romania twice, 2-0 in Podgorica and 3-0 in Bucharest.

===== Kosovo =====
Romania is a strong supporter of Serbia&#x27;s territorial integrity and has not recognized the legitimacy of Kosovo&#x27;s independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. The two teams met only four times, but all the matches led to problems and antipathy feelings between the two peoples.

====== 2023 match ======
On September 12, 2023, the two teams met in Bucharest for the qualifying stage of UEFA Euro 2024. In the eighteenth minute, the Kosovar players left the pitch in a protest after a bottle was thrown from the Romanian sector, which was combined with the two banners quoting &quot;Basarabia e România” (”Bessarabia is Romania” in Romanian) and ”Kosovo je Srbija” (”Kosovo is Serbia” in Serbian) and the constant pro-Serbia chants of the Romanian extremist fanbase ”Uniți sub Tricolor” (”United under Tricolour”). The match was interrupted for fifty minutes and the Football Federation of Kosovo appealed for a 3-0 victory over Romania because of the incidents, which was turned down by UEFA. Romania won the match 2-0.

====== 2024 matches ======
The two teams have met again in the first leg match in group of League C of the UEFA Nations League, season 2024–25. The match took place on Kosovo&#x27;s Fadil Vokrri Stadium, on 6 September . Once again, the mutual animosity between the two sides was evident, as during the opening ceremony, the Kosovar fans booed while the Romanian anthem was playing. At the end of the match, after a decisive 3–0 victory for Romania, the Kosovar fans threw various objects at Romania&#x27;s squad while they were leaving the pitch.

When Romania played Lithuania on 9 September, Romanian fans chanted anti-Kosovo messages which resulted in a €52,500 fine and a partial closure of Arena Națională for the match against Kosovo the very next month.

Already a tense match after the incidents in Kosovo and Lithuania, the two sides faced each other again in Bucharest. A victory for the hosts would have meant promotion to League B of the competition&#x27;s next season. Kosovo needed a 3 goals difference victory in order to take Romania&#x27;s spot before the last matchday, and dominated the match. As the final whistle was approaching, after suffering a tackle, Kosovar player Albion Rrahmani attacked Romanian player Denis Alibec, before both teams began fighting on the pitch, the Danish referee booking three players, two of Kosovo and one of Romania. The Romanians proceeded to take a free kick, a moment again disrupted by the Kosovars as they walked over the Romanian fan sector to engage in a verbal fight with the Romanian fans who allegedly began shouting &quot;Serbia! Serbia!&quot;.

In the 97th minute of the match, four minutes after the fight between Alibec and Rrahamni took place, the Kosovars left the pitch despite their manager&#x27;s plead to not. While leaving the pitch, Kosovo&#x27;s goalkeeper Arijanet Muric was seen showing the middle finger to the Romanian fans. The Romanian team remained on the pitch for one more hour until the referee suspended the match. Meanwhile, the Kosovar players trashed their changing room, leaked pictures of trash and pizza being posted online. Problems continued even after this, with both delegations almost fighting again in the press conference room.

The match was counted as &quot;abandoned&quot;. No matter the final result, Romania was crowned as the group winner after a 4–1 victory against Cyprus three days later, despite the final result still pending. However, on 20 November, five days after the match, UEFA announced that Romania won the match 3–0, but will have to play one match at home without fans and face a €128,000 fine, while Kosovo would also receive a €6,000 fine for forfeiting the match.

===Kits===
Romania&#x27;s kits have been supplied by Spanish company Joma from 2015, which replaced Adidas following a three-decade contract. In 2017, the Romanian Football Federation announced its first brand identity and a new kit; the new emblem references the coat of arms of all five Romanian provinces with the intention to symbolise the unity of Romania.

=== Home stadium ===
The Romania national team mainly plays its home games at the Arena Națională in Bucharest, the largest stadium in the country. It opened in 2011 and has a capacity of 55,600 seats. The stadium is a Category 4 venue and hosted the 2012 Europa League final and Euro 2020.

Other games, including friendlies and World Cup and Euro qualifiers, have been played at other venues such as the Steaua Stadium (Bucharest), the Ion Oblemenco Stadium (Craiova), the Cluj Arena (Cluj-Napoca), the smaller Dr. Constantin Rădulescu (Cluj-Napoca), Ilie Oană (Ploiești) and Rapid-Giulești (Bucharest) stadiums.

===Media coverage===

Romania&#x27;s UEFA Nations League games, major tournament qualifiers and friendlies are to be televised on Pro TV up until 2022. Between 2008 and 2014, Antena 1 had the rights to broadcast the country&#x27;s home matches, friendlies and qualifiers. From 2014 to 2018, Romania&#x27;s qualifying matches for the European Championship and the World Cup, plus two pre-Euro and one post-Euro friendly match were taken over by TVR. The friendly matches that were not broadcast by TVR were taken over by Pro TV. In March 2019, the latter took over all broadcasts of Romania&#x27;s fixtures from TVR, with the effective broadcasting starting in September 2018.

<text>Systematic theology, or systematics, is a discipline of Christian theology that formulates an orderly, rational, and coherent account of the doctrines of the Christian faith. It addresses issues such as what the Bible teaches about certain topics or what is true about God and his universe. It also builds on biblical disciplines, church history, as well as biblical and historical theology. Systematic theology shares its systematic tasks with other disciplines such as constructive theology, dogmatics, ethics, apologetics, and philosophy of religion.

== Method ==

With a methodological tradition that differs somewhat from biblical theology, systematic theology draws on the core sacred texts of Christianity, while simultaneously investigating the development of Christian doctrine over the course of history, particularly through philosophy, ethics, social sciences, and natural sciences. Using biblical texts, it attempts to compare and relate all of scripture which led to the creation of a systematized statement on what the whole Bible says about particular issues. In other words, &quot;In reconstructing Christian teaching, systematic theology proceeds by a process of conceptual abstraction and schematization.&quot; 

In a seminal article, &quot;Principles of Systematic Theology,&quot; Anglican theologian John Webster describes systematic theology as proceeding along a series of principles, which he draws from various theologians including Thomas Aquinas:

* The Trinity: The Ontological Principle (&quot;principium essendi&quot;)
* Scripture: The External/Objective Cognitive Principle (&quot;principium cognoscendi externum&quot;)
* The Redeemed Intelligence of the Saints: The Internal/Subjective Cognitive Principle (&quot;principium cognoscendi internum&quot;)
Webster has also considered the task of all systematic theology as articulating the Creator/creature distinction, known also as the Categorical Distinction or the Infinite Qualitative Distinction, a concept also explored from the perspective of compatiblistic metaphysics by Kathryn Tanner in &quot;God and Creation in Christian Theology&quot; (1988).

Within Christianity, different traditions (both intellectual and ecclesial) approach systematic theology in different ways impacting a) the method employed to develop the system, b) the understanding of theology&#x27;s task, c) the doctrines included in the system, and d) the order those doctrines appear. Even with such diversity, it is generally the case that works that one can describe as systematic theologies begin with revelation and conclude with eschatology.

Since it is focused on truth, systematic theology is also framed to interact with and address the contemporary world. Many authors have explored this area, including Charles Gore, John Walvoord, Lindsay Dewar, and Charles Moule. This process concludes with applications to contemporary issues.
==Categories==
Since it is a systemic approach, systematic theology organizes truth under different headings and there are certain basic areas (or categories), although the exact list may vary slightly. These are:

*Angelology – The study of angels
*Bibliology – The study of the Bible
*Cosmology – The study of creation
*Hamartiology – The study of sin
*Christology – The study of Christ
*Ecclesiology – The study of the church
*Eschatology – The study of the end times
*Pneumatology – The study of the Holy Spirit
*Soteriology – The study of salvation
*Theological anthropology – The study of the nature of humanity
*Theology proper – The study of the character of God, which is composed of Paterology (the study of God the Father), Christology (the study of Jesus Christ) and Pneumatology (the study of the Holy Spirit).

==History==

The establishment and integration of varied Christian ideas and Christianity-related notions, including diverse topics and themes of the Bible, in a single, coherent and well-ordered presentation is a relatively late development. The first known church father who referred to the notion of devising a comprehensive understanding of the principles of Christianity was Clement of Alexandria in the 3rd century, who stated thus: &quot;Faith is then, so to speak, a comprehensive knowledge of the essentials.&quot; Clement himself, along with his follower Origen, attempted to create some systematic theology in their numerous surviving writings. The first systematic theology in Latin was Lactantius&#x27;s &quot;Divine Institutes,&quot; and the term &quot;Intitutio&quot; would set a precedence for works of systematic theology in the western tradition. In Eastern Orthodoxy, an early example is provided by John of Damascus&#x27;s 8th-century &quot;Exposition of the Orthodox Faith&quot;, in which he attempts to set in order and demonstrate the coherence of the theology of the classic texts of the Eastern theological tradition.

In the West, Peter Lombard&#x27;s 12th-century &quot;Sentences&quot;, wherein he thematically collected a great series of quotations of the Church Fathers, became the basis of a medieval scholastic tradition of thematic commentary and explanation. Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; best exemplifies this scholastic tradition. The Lutheran scholastic tradition of a thematic, ordered exposition of Christian theology emerged in the 16th century with Philipp Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci Communes&quot;, and was countered by a Calvinist scholasticism, which is exemplified by John Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;.

The 17th century saw a boom in focused systematic theologies within a renaissance of the scholastic method. Francis Turretin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of Elenctic Theology&quot; (1696) and Petrus van Mastricht&#x27;s &quot;Theoretical-Practical Theology&quot; (1680) became touchstone works in the field, profoundly influencing later theologians like William Cunningham, Jonathan Edwards, Charles Hodge, and Herman Bavinck. Similarly, William Ames&#x27;s systematic treatise, &quot;The Marrow of Theology&quot; (1629)&quot;,&quot; would become the standard textbook for Harvard and Yale in their nascent years.

In the 19th century, primarily in Protestant groups, varieties of systematic theology arose that attempted to demonstrate that Christian doctrine formed a more coherent system premised on one or more fundamental axioms, often reasoned out as a form of dogmatic theology. Such theologies often involved a more drastic pruning and reinterpretation of traditional belief in order to cohere with the axiom or axioms, and continental theology divided between various schools of dogmatic theology, e.g. Erlangen Theology ( e.g. F.C.K. Hoffman, Thomasius, and Gisle Johnson), Mediating Theology (e.g. Isaak Dorner), classical confessionalism (e.g. Hans Lassen Martensen and Herman Bavinck), and liberal theology (e.g. Friedrich Schleiermacher and Albrecht Ritschle). In the United States, Charles Hodge&#x27;s &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; became a popular text in conjunction with his work at Princeton Theological Seminary. Significant for this period, Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher&#x27;s &quot;Der christliche Glaube nach den Grundsätzen der evangelischen Kirche&quot; (&quot;The Christian Faith According to the Principles of the Protestant Church&quot; [1821-1822]) espoused the fundamental idea of a universal presence among humanity, sometimes more hidden, sometimes more explicit, of a feeling or awareness of &#x27;absolute dependence,&#x27; and this became a focal point of either acceptation, integration, or rejection among theologians. As such, systematic theology in the 19th century became a sophisticated endeavor of developing and articulating theology from certain assumed first principles, often on the back of the philosophical conversations inherited from Hegel, Kant, and Schleiermacher.

Systematic theology likewise saw a great variety of development into the 20th century, most notably with the advancement of Neo-Orthodoxy and the multivolume &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot; of Karl Barth. Helmuth Thielicke wrote his three-volume work, &quot;The Evangelical Faith,&quot; as a confessionally-Lutheran theology with existentialist emphases, and Wolfhart Pannenberg&#x27;s three-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; is an eclectic example of modernist systematics that attempts to integrate faith and science. Robert Jenson&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Systematic Theology,&quot; stands as a final installment of 20th century systematic theology, looking to questions of postmodernity from a Barthian perspective. Several popular-level textbook-style works emerged during this period within Evangelical theology, from Lewis Sperry Chafer&#x27;s eight-volume &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; to Wayne Grudem&#x27;s stand-alone title &quot;Systematic Theology,&quot; a particularly sophisticated non-textbook example being the epistemological worldview theology of Carl F.H. Henry, contained in his six-volume &quot;God, Revelation and Authority.&quot; Reformed theology also saw considerable contributions in the twentieth century, including Louis Berkhof&#x27;s popular &quot;Systematic Theology&quot; and G.C. Berkouwer&#x27;s multivolume &quot;Studies in Dogmatics.&quot; The latter half of the twentieth century also saw the emergence of systematic theologies dealing with critical themes from social, political, and economic perspective, including the Liberation Theology of James Cone and Gustavo Gutiérrez, the Post-liberal Theology associated with Yale Divinity School, and Feminist Theology (e.g. Sarah Coakley). As such, the variety and perspectives of systematic theology in the 20th century has tracked well with both the broadening of ethical concerns post-World War II, its expansive pluralism, and the advent of postmodernism.

<text>SSAB AB, earlier SvensktStålAB (English: Swedish Steel) (Nasdaq Stockholm: SSAB A, SSAB B) is a Swedish company, formed in 1978, that specialises in producing steel. The largest shareholders are the Swedish state-owned mining company LKAB, and the Government of Finland.

== History ==

Svenskt Stål AB was established on 1 January 1978, following a Swedish parliamentary decision to merge three struggling steel companies: Domnarvets Ironworks, Norrbottens Järnverk AB (NJA), and Oxelösunds Ironworks. The merger was proposed by a government-led investigation to consolidate Sweden&#x27;s struggling steel industry.

At its founding, SSAB was 50% owned by the Swedish state and 25% each by Gränges and Stora Kopparberg. Björn Wahlström, managing director of NJA, led the merger negotiations and became SSAB&#x27;s first managing director. The company initially employed approximately 18,000 workers across various operations. 

=== Restructuring and profitability (1980s) ===
The initial years were financially challenging, with losses recorded between 1978 and 1981. The company restructured by closing unprofitable operations and focusing on specific products and locations. In 1982, SSAB reported its first profitable year. Ownership changes followed, with Stora selling its stake to the Swedish state in 1981, and Gränges being acquired by Electrolux. SSAB further focused on steel production and was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1989.

In 1987, a new restructuring plan led to the concentration of production within certain areas. The company formed subsidiaries SSAB Tunnplåt AB (for thin sheet steel production) and SSAB Oxelösund AB. A third subsidiary, SSAB Profiler, was also established but later sold to Ovako Steel. The Domnarvet electrosteel plant was closed in 1989, moving focus to continuous casting from Luleå.

=== Expansion and modernisation (1990s) ===
Following its stock market listing, the Swedish state gradually reduced its own ownership in SSAB, fully divesting direct ownership by 1992. The same year, SSAB acquired Korrugals band-coating line in Finspång and introduced the &quot;Sträng 5&quot; continuous casting line in Luleå. In 1993, a CAS-OB facility was established in Luleå, and SSAB Laminated Steel AB in Ronneby was integrated into SSAB Tunnplåt. Significant investments included a new pre-rolling mill in Borlänge in 1999 and a new blast furnace (Masugn 3) in Luleå in 2000.

=== International expansion (2000s - 2010s) ===
In 2008, SSAB acquired the American steel producer IPSCO, which operated mills in Montpelier, Iowa, and Mobile, Alabama. These facilities focused on scrap-based steel production using electric arc furnaces rather than blast furnaces.

In 2014, SSAB acquired Finnish steel producer Rautaruukki for €1.1 bn. The acquisition increased SSAB&#x27;s steel production capacity by 2.6 million tons. Following the merger, Finnish state-owned Solidium became SSAB&#x27;s third-largest shareholder after Industrivärden and LKAB. Key Rautaruukki production facilities that remained operational included the steel plant in Raahe and the sheet and pipe manufacturing facility in Hämeenlinna. 

=== Sustainability Initiatives (2020-) ===
In 2021, SSAB produced the world&#x27;s first fossil-free steel using hydrogen instead of coke-based processes. The steel was delivered to Volvo Group for testing. Today, SSAB operates under three main divisions: SSAB Special Steels, SSAB Europe, and SSAB Americas. It also owns subsidiaries Ruukki Construction and Tibnor. The company&#x27;s product brands include SSAB Domex, Hardox, Docol, GreenCoat, Armox, and Toolox.

SSAB also sponsors the Swedish Steel Prize and has been involved in various government-supported research programs, such as the &quot;Steel Eco-System&quot; initiative. 

In 2024, SSAB announced that it would build its €4.5 billion fossil-free steel mill in Luleå, Sweden, rather than in Raahe, Finland. The decision, which was made after considering both locations, is expected to reduce Sweden&#x27;s carbon dioxide emissions by 7% upon completion in 2028.

==Operations==
SSAB has its production sites in Sweden, Finland, and the United States. The company also maintains smaller operations elsewhere, including a processing facility in Kunshan near Shanghai, China. and distribution hubs in the Baltic region.

=== Sweden ===

The production is located at Luleå, Borlänge, Oxelösund and Finspång. SSAB is the largest steel sheet manufacturer in Scandinavia, with its blast furnace, coking plant, and steelworks located in Luleå and its rolling mills and coating plants in Borlänge—the initial product is sent from one location to the other via train. The division also has a coil coating line, lamination line, and special steels production. SSAB Special Steels in Oxelösund is the only steelworks in Sweden to have its entire vertical production base in one place, from raw material handling to its rolling plates. Ninety percent of its production is exported, with its chief export partner being Germany. SSAB produces nearly all of the steel plates created in Sweden.

=== Finland ===
SSAB operates two major steel production facilities in Finland, located in Raahe and Hämeenlinna. The Raahe plant, originally established as Rautaruukki in the 1960s to support Finland’s heavy industry, is one of the youngest integrated steel plants in Europe. It began operations with its first blast furnace in 1964, followed by an LD steel plant and rolling mills in the subsequent years. The Hämeenlinna facility, which started production in 1972, specialises in processing steel into coated products, including galvanised steel for industries such as automotive manufacturing. It employs approximately 1,000 people. The headquarters for SSAB Europe Oy are located in Hämeenlinna.

=== North America ===

IPSCO Inc. began as Prairie Pipe Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1956, changing its name to Interprovincial Steel and Pipe Corporation, Ltd. in 1960 and IPSCO, Inc. in 1984; the company would later be purchased by SSAB, and is the origin of SSAB&#x27;s operations in the region. All SSAB operations in North America are now operated as SSAB Americas.

As of 2000, IPSCO had used mini mills to produce flat-rolled steel for 40 years. Late in 2001, the company officially opened an Axis, Alabama mill (in the Mobile area), with a capacity of 1,250,000 tonnes. The $US425 million rolling mill, with mill stand housings believed to be the largest one-piece cast mill housings in the world at 350 tons each, uses scrap steel to produce discrete plate and coiled hot rolled plate. Montpelier, Iowa had a similar facility which began operations in 1997, but this one would serve the Gulf coast. On 21 October 2008, SSAB announced a $US460 million expansion of the Axis mill to be completed in 2011. The mill already had 400 employees and 350 contractors.

In May 2007, a deal to acquire IPSCO for $US7.7 billion was announced. At the time, IPSCO&#x27;s annual production was 4.3 million tonnes, with four steel mills and eleven pipe mills. On 17 July 2008, SSAB announced the completion of the deal. John Tulloch succeeded the retiring David Sutherland as IPSCO president and became an executive vice president of SSAB.

On 17 March 2008, Evraz Group SA announced it would buy SSAB&#x27;s Canada pipe and plate business and the steel tube business of the American IPSCO unit for $US4.3 billion after steel prices rose and the dollar fell. Evraz also planned to sell some of the American assets for $US1.7 billion to OAO TMK. IPSCO had 4300 employees, with 70% of its operation in the United States and 30% in Canada.

After the sale, SSAB changed the name of its North American operation to SSAB North American Division (NAD), then later to SSAB Americas; headquarters stayed in Lisle, Illinois, USA. Included in this division were steel operations in Mobile and Montpelier, and cut-to-length lines in St. Paul, Minnesota and Houston, Texas, USA; and Toronto, Ontario, Canada. David Britten succeeded Tulloch as president. Paul Wilson, with 36 years of industry experience, ten of those with SSAB including management of Mobile&#x27;s steel operation, became the vice president in charge of the American steel operations. In 2018 the SSAB Americas division relocated its headquarters to Mobile, Alabama.

<text>Shotton is a town and community in Flintshire, Wales, within the Deeside conurbation along the River Dee, joined with Connah&#x27;s Quay, near the border with England. It is located 5 miles (8 km) west of Chester and can be reached by road from the A548. In the 2011 census, Shotton had a population of 6,663.

==Etymologies==
The town&#x27;s name is first recorded in Old English as &quot;Cyllingas&quot;. This name derives from the Welsh language word Celyn (meaning Holly) and has persisted in one form or another throughout the town&#x27;s history. By 1822, Richard Willett recorded the name as &quot;Kyllins&quot;, which he says contains &quot;one of the parish&#x27;s most notable ancient houses&quot;. Even today, &quot;Killin&#x27;s Farm&quot; and &quot;Killin&#x27;s Lane&quot; may still be found in the oldest part of town.

The town&#x27;s modern English name is shared with three other towns in Britain. These towns (all on the English side of the Scottish border) derive their names from &quot;Town of Scots&quot; but it is unlikely that a Flintshire town shares this etymology. The name probably derives from &quot;Scēot-tūn&quot; = &quot;farmstead on or near a steep slope&quot;, or from &quot;Shot-tūn&quot; = &quot;farmstead in a clearing in the wood&quot;. The town is officially named &quot;Shotton&quot; in both English and Welsh, making it one of the few towns in Wales to officially have neither a recognised Welsh spelling or Welsh etymology.

==History==
The town grew from the 18th century around coal mining and farming on reclaimed marshland. Shotton also became a railway junction. The John Summers &amp; Sons steelworks was established in 1896 on a six-acre site. At its peak it employed over 13,000. Following nationalisation in 1967, the works became part of the British Steel Corporation. Although it is known as Shotton Steel Works, the large plant (owned by Tata Steel since 2006) is across the river from Shotton, with most being in the community of Connah&#x27;s Quay.

The town lies next to the Hawarden Bridge, which was completed in 1889 as a swing-opening bridge. The opening mechanism was disabled in 1960.

==Demography==
Shotton has an area of 2.34 km2, with a density of 3,001 km2. The population is roughly 50% male and female and 62.2% are between the ages of 18 and 64.

The community consists of three electoral wards of the Flintshire County Council local authority:

==Education==
Shotton is served by the following schools:
* Connah&#x27;s Quay High School (English-medium secondary)

<text>Jeffrey Wall, OC, RSA (born September 29, 1946) is a Canadian photographer. He is artist best known for his large-scale back-lit Cibachrome photographs and art history writing. Early in his career, he helped define the Vancouver School and he has published essays on the work of his colleagues and fellow Vancouverites Rodney Graham, Ken Lum, and Ian Wallace. His photographic tableaux often take Vancouver&#x27;s mixture of natural beauty, urban decay, and postmodern and industrial featurelessness as their backdrop.

==Career==
Wall received his MA from the University of British Columbia in 1970, with a thesis titled &quot;Berlin Dada and the Notion of Context&quot;. That same year, he stopped making art. With his English wife, Jeannette, whom he had met as a student in Vancouver, and their two young sons, he moved to London to do postgraduate work from 1970 to 1973 at the Courtauld Institute, where he studied with T.J. Clark. Wall was assistant professor at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (1974–75), associate professor at Simon Fraser University (1976–87), and lectured at the European Graduate School. He was a full professor at the University of British Columbia until his retirement in 1999. Wall has published essays on Dan Graham, Rodney Graham, Roy Arden, Ken Lum, Stephan Balkenhol, On Kawara, and other contemporary artists. As a trained art historian, he has also discussed his own work extensively. Wall&#x27;s essays and interviews conveying his philosophical interests have shaped critical discussions of his career.

==Artistic practice==
Wall experimented with conceptual art while an undergraduate at UBC. He then made no art until 1977, when he produced his first backlit photo-transparencies. Most of these are staged and refer to the history of art and philosophical problems of representation. Their compositions often allude to artists like Diego Velázquez, Hokusai, and Édouard Manet, or to writers such as Franz Kafka, Yukio Mishima, and Ralph Ellison.

Wall&#x27;s work beginning in the late 1970s experimented with notions of theatricality influenced by television, advertising, and commercial window displays. Presenting his first gallery exhibition in 1978 as an &quot;installation&quot; rather than as a photography show, the artist placed &quot;The Destroyed Room&quot; in the storefront window of the Nova Gallery, enclosing it in a plasterboard wall.

&quot;Mimic&quot; (1982) typifies Wall&#x27;s cinematographic style and according to art historian Michael Fried is &quot;characteristic of Wall&#x27;s engagement in his art of the 1980s with social issues&quot;. A 198 × 226 cm colour transparency, it shows a white couple and an Asian man walking towards the camera. The sidewalk, flanked by parked cars and residential and light-industrial buildings, suggests a North American industrial suburb. The woman is wearing red shorts and a white top displaying her midriff; her bearded, unkempt boyfriend wears a denim vest. The Asian man is casual but well-dressed in comparison, in a collared shirt and slacks. As the couple overtake the man, the boyfriend makes an ambiguous but apparently obscene and racist gesture, holding his upraised middle finger close to the corner of his eye, &quot;slanting&quot; his eye in mockery of the Asian man&#x27;s eyes. The picture resembles a candid shot that captures the moment and its implicit social tensions, but is actually a recreation of an exchange witnessed by the artist.
&quot;Picture for Women&quot; is a 142.5 × 204.5 cm Cibachrome transparency mounted on a lightbox. Along with &quot;The Destroyed Room&quot;, Wall considers &quot;Picture for Women&quot; to be his first success in challenging photographic tradition. According to Tate Modern, this success allows Wall to reference &quot;both popular culture (the illuminated signs of cinema and advertising hoardings) and the sense of scale he admires in classical painting. As three-dimensional objects, the lightboxes take on a sculptural presence, impacting on the viewer’s physical sense of orientation in relationship to the work.&quot;

There are two figures in the scene, Wall himself, and a woman looking into the camera. In a profile of Wall in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, art critic Jed Perl describes &quot;Picture for Women&quot; as Wall&#x27;s signature piece, &quot;since it doubles as a portrait of the late-twentieth-century artist in his studio.&quot; Art historian David Campany calls &quot;Picture for Women&quot; an important early work for Wall as it establishes central themes and motifs found in much of his later work.

A response to Manet&#x27;s &quot;Un bar aux Folies Bergère&quot;, the Tate Modern wall text for &quot;Picture of Women&quot;, from the 2005–2006 exhibition &quot;Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004&quot;, outlines the influence of Manet&#x27;s painting:

In Manet’s painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet’s barmaid, while the man is the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer’s role as onlooker, are implicit in Manet’s painting, Wall updates the theme by positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same time, looks straight out at us.

Wall&#x27;s work advances an argument for the need for pictorial art. Some of Wall&#x27;s photographs are complicated productions involving cast, sets, crews and digital postproduction. They have been characterized as one-frame cinematic productions. Susan Sontag ended her last book, &quot;Regarding the Pain of Others&quot; (2003), with a long, laudatory discussion of one of them, &quot;Dead Troops Talk (A Vision After an Ambush of a Red Army Patrol near Moqor, Afghanistan, Winter 1986)&quot; (1992), calling Wall&#x27;s Goya-influenced depiction of a made-up event &quot;exemplary in its thoughtfulness and power.&quot;

While Wall is known for large-scale photographs of contemporary everyday genre scenes populated with figures, in the early 1990s he became interested in still lifes. He distinguishes between unstaged &quot;documentary&quot; pictures, like &quot;Still Creek, Vancouver, winter 2003&quot;, and &quot;cinematographic&quot; pictures, produced using a combination of actors, sets, and special effects, such as &quot;A Sudden Gust of Wind (after Hokusai)&quot;, 1993. Based on &quot;Yejiri Station, Province of Suruga&quot; (ca. 1832) a woodblock print by Katsushika Hokusai, &quot;A Sudden Gust of Wind&quot; recreates the depicted 19th-century Japanese scene in contemporary British Columbia, using actors and took over a year to produce 100 photographs in order &quot;to achieve a seamless montage that gives the illusion of capturing a real moment in time.&quot;

Since the early 1990s, Wall has used digital technology to create montages of different individual negatives, blending them into what appears as a single unified photograph. His signature works are large transparencies mounted on light boxes; he says he conceived this format when he saw back-lit advertisements at bus stops during a trip between Spain and London. In 1995, Wall began making traditional silver gelatine black and white photographs, and these have become an increasingly significant part of his work. Examples were exhibited at Kassel&#x27;s documenta X.

First shown at documenta 11, &quot;After &quot;Invisible Man&quot; by Ralph Ellison, the Prologue&quot; (1999–2000) represents a well-known scene from Ellison&#x27;s classic novel. Wall&#x27;s version shows us the cellar room, &quot;warm and full of light,&quot; in which Ellison&#x27;s narrator lives, complete with its 1,369 lightbulbs.

==Exhibitions==
Wall&#x27;s early group exhibitions include 1969 shows at the Seattle Art Museum, Washington, and Vancouver Art Gallery, and New Multiple Art at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 1970. His first one-man show was held at Nova Gallery, Vancouver in 1978.

Solo shows include ICA, London (1984), Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland (1993), Whitechapel Gallery, London (2001), Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany (2001), Museum für Moderne Kunst Frankfurt (2001/2002), Hasselblad Center, Göteborg, Sweden (2002), Astrup Fearnley Museum, Oslo, Norway (2004) and retrospectives at Schaulager, Basel (2005), Tate Modern (2005) and MoMA, New York (2007), Art Institute of Chicago (2007), SFMoMA, San Francisco (2008), Tamayo Museum, Mexico City and Vancouver Art Gallery, Vancouver (2008), and Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Dresden (2010). Wall was also included in documentas 10 and 11.

For his retrospective at the Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels in 2011, Wall chose some 130 works by his favorite artists, from 1900s photographer Eugène Atget to film excerpts (Fassbinder, Bergman, the Dardenne brothers) to pieces by contemporaries Thomas Struth and David Claerbout. They were shown alongside 25 of his own pictures.

==Awards and recognition==
*Hasselblad Award, 2002
*Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, 2006 
*Officer of the Order of Canada, 2007 
*Audain Prize for Lifetime Achievement (British Columbia&#x27;s annual award for the visual arts), 2008
*Wall was included in Blake Gopnik&#x27;s 2011 list &quot;The 10 Most Important Artists of Today&quot;, with Gopnik arguing, &quot;For three decades, Wall has been testing the full range of what pictures can still do and mean, after anti-art had &#x27;proved&#x27; them dead.&quot;

==Influence==
Wall&#x27;s large-scale images and studied compositions are regarded as influential on the Düsseldorf School of Photography led by Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, and Candida Höfer. (Gursky has cited Wall as &quot;a great model for me.&quot;)

<text>The Bulgaria national football team () represents Bulgaria in men&#x27;s international football, and is administered by the Bulgarian Football Union, a member association of UEFA.

Bulgaria&#x27;s best achievements are reaching the final at the 1968 Summer Olympics and the fourth-place finish at the FIFA World Cup in 1994. Bulgaria have competed at a total of seven World Cups, debuting in 1962 and last appearing in 1998. In addition, they have participated in two European Championships, in 1996 and 2004, the latter marking their most recent major tournament appearance. The team has also competed at the Balkan Cup, winning three titles.

==History==

===1922–1945: early history===
The Bulgaria national football team was formed in 1922. In 1923, the Bulgarian Football Union was formed and the team&#x27;s first match was held in Vienna on 21 May 1924, which resulted in a 6–0 defeat against Austria. Bulgaria also participated in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris a few days later.

After being unable to compete in the 1930 World Cup, the Bulgarian side did not qualify for any major tournament for nearly 30 years, narrowly falling short of qualification on numerous occasions. The national team had gone on a streak of finishing 2nd or 3rd in their qualifying groups along with proceeding to the play-offs, but in the end, failing to qualify. Despite their qualifying problems, the national team did manage to defeat many elite teams during memorable international friendlies during those years. It also seemed as if the only tournaments they managed to qualify for were smaller tournaments, such as the Balkan Cup, which they won three times (1931, 1932 and 1973–76), thus being the competition&#x27;s second most successful team only behind Romania with four titles.

===1960s and 1970s===

Bulgaria qualified for the World Cup for the first time in its history in 1962 and followed that up with consecutive appearances in 1966, 1970 and 1974. The team, however, did not have much success and finished in third place in their group two out of the four times.

Bulgaria took part in qualifiers for the European Championship in 1968 and went on to win their group with impressive wins over Norway, Sweden, and Portugal. Although they would go on to lose to the eventual champions and hosts Italy in a two-legged qualifying play-off.

At the 1968 Summer Olympics, the team won the silver medal. They finished first in Group D by defeating Thailand 7–0, Guatemala 2–1, and drawing 2–2 against Czechoslovakia. They advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Israel and then the semi-finals by defeating favored hosts Mexico. In the Olympic Final, the team was defeated by Hungary, in what many would say was a hard-fought match for both sides.

Despite winning the Balkan Cup twice in 1931 and 1932, the Bulgaria national team added two more trophies to their case as they went on to win the tournament in 1973 and 1976. In both 1973 and 1976, Bulgaria had used their previous World Cup experience to create a very tactical team. This paid off quite well, as they had many decisive victories over Hungary, Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Poland, Albania and Romania. In fact, the team won the 1976 Balkan Cup by beating Romania in the two-legged final 1–0 and 3–2.

Bulgaria finally qualified for their first World Cup in 1962. Bulgaria was drawn in a tough group with elite opponents in England, powerhouse Argentina and Hungary. Bulgaria opened up their campaign with a narrow 0–1 loss to Argentina. Later on, Bulgaria would lose their second group match by a 6–1 score to Hungary. Bulgaria&#x27;s hopes of qualifying were over, but the national team impressively drew with England (who would host and win the next tournament) 0–0 and finished fourth in the group with only one point.

Bulgaria qualified for their second straight World Cup, drawn into an even tougher group compared to the previous World Cup. They were placed in the group of death with superpowers Hungary, Portugal and Brazil, with Pelé at the helm. Bulgaria opened their campaign match with a 0–2 loss to Brazil thanks to two free kick goals by Pelé and Garrincha. In their second match Bulgaria loss 0–3 to Eusebio&#x27;s Portugal. Finally, Bulgaria with no chance of advancing to the next round, finished their last match with a 1–3 loss to Hungary. Bulgaria once again finished fourth with zero points in the group.

After their poor World Cup performance, Bulgaria was determined to redeem themselves. Bulgaria was drawn in a very tough group for qualifying, with Norway and Sweden, along with Eusebio&#x27;s Portugal. Bulgaria started off with a 4–2 win over Norway. They would add to their winning streak with a 2–0 victory against Sweden. In their next two matches Bulgaria would draw 0–0 against Norway, and dominate Sweden 3–0. In their final two group fixtures Bulgaria played Portugal to a 1–0 victory at home and an 0–0 draw on the road, but it was enough to advance to the two-legged qualifying play-off. There Bulgaria were drawn against eventual Euro 1968 host Italy. Italy were defeated in the first leg 3–2, but won the second by a 0–2 score to advance 4–3 on aggregate. Italy would win the playoff and go on to win the tournament, while Bulgaria was eliminated from reaching the finals.

A month and a half after the European Championship qualifying came the Olympics, which Bulgaria had qualified for the fifth time in their history. They were drawn in a simple group with Thailand, Guatemala and Czechoslovakia. Bulgaria started off with a 7–0 thrashing of Thailand. They later went on and drew with Czechoslovakia 2–2 to increase their point standards. Their final match once again determined if they would carry on to the quarter-finals. Needing a decisive win, Bulgaria went on to defeat Guatemala 2–1 and win their Olympic group. They qualified directly to the quarter-finals facing underdogs, Israel. The game remained 1–1 for most of the match until a drawing of lots determined who would go on to the semi-finals of the tournament. Winning the draw Bulgaria advanced to the semi-finals against Mexico. After a very hard-fought match, Bulgaria proved stronger as they came out on top with a 3–2 victory. Bulgaria advanced to the finals for the first time in their Olympic history. They were determined to win the gold medal, but fell short with a 1–4 loss to Hungary. Although battling hard, Bulgaria came out with the silver medal.

Bulgaria qualified for their third straight World Cup, held in Mexico, just like the 1968 Olympics. They were drawn in a very tricky group with Germany, Peru and Morocco. Bulgaria played their first match against Peru, losing 3–2. Germany won Bulgaria&#x27;s second match, 5–2. The last group stage match ended 1–1; Bulgaria ended up in 3rd place.

The 1974 World Cup was held in West Germany. They were drawn in a decently tough group, with the Netherlands, Sweden and Uruguay. Bulgaria started off with a goalless draw with Sweden. They drew again, this time 1–1 with Uruguay. As the final match came, Bulgaria fell by a 4–1 score. Bulgaria remained in third place in the group stages.

===1986–2000===
Bulgaria qualified for the 1986 World Cup in Mexico by finishing second in Group Four, behind France with 11 points, but ahead of powerful rivals Yugoslavia and East Germany. This was their fifth World Cup appearance. They were drawn in Group A with Italy, Argentina, and South Korea. In the opening match of the World Cup, the Bulgarians held the defending champions Italy to an impressive 1–1 draw. Alessandro Altobelli gave the Italians the lead, but an 85th-minute equalizer by Nasko Sirakov gave the Bulgarians the point they needed. The next match was another 1–1 draw against South Korea with the goal for Bulgaria coming from Plamen Getov in the 11th minute. They lost the final match of the group 2–0 against Argentina, who eventually won the tournament. Despite not recording a win, the Bulgarians advanced to the knockout stage by being the third-best third-placed team. By doing so, Bulgaria along with Uruguay became the first nations to qualify for the knockout stage without winning a game in the first round. In the Round of 16, they faced World Cup hosts Mexico, who were looking for revenge due to their previous home Olympic semi-final loss to Bulgaria in Mexico City in 1968. The match was hard-fought from both sides of the scale but ultimately, Mexico came away with the 2–0 win.


Certainly one of the most important dates in Bulgarian football history is 17 November 1993, a date on which Emil Kostadinov scored a deciding goal in the 90th minute to beat France in Paris, allowing Bulgaria to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994. Under the management of Dimitar Penev, the Bulgarians, led by players such as Hristo Stoichkov, Yordan Lechkov, and Krasimir Balakov, along with a multitude of other talented players remembered in Bulgaria as the &quot;Golden Generation&quot;, made a strong impression by surprisingly reaching the semi-finals. They entered a very tough Group D with 1990 World Cup runners-up Argentina with Diego Maradona at the helm, African Nations Cup champions Nigeria, and Balkan rivals Greece. The first match ended with a 3–0 defeat to Nigeria. Despite the bad start, the team made quite a huge statement by winning 4–0 against their Greece - their first ever win in a World Cup - and increasing their goal difference. Their third and final match came against Argentina. The powerful Bulgarian side came away with a shocking 2–0 victory. Going into injury-time, Argentina was leading the group. A 91st-minute strike from Nasko Sirakov, however, meant that they&#x27;d drop two places and finish third.

Bulgaria continued to the round of 16, where they faced Mexico. Stoichkov opened the scoring in the sixth minute with an incredible strike off a break away from outside the box, tallying his fourth goal. The match ended 1–1 and after no goals were scored in extra time, penalties decided which team would go through. Team captain Borislav Mihaylov saved the first three penalty kicks in a row, breaking the World Cup record. Bulgaria won 3–1 on penalties. In the quarter-finals, Bulgaria faced the defending world champions Germany. At the start of the match held in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, the Bulgarians dominated impressively, hitting the post twice in the process, but eventually found themselves behind after Lothar Matthäus scored the opening goal for the Germans. The Bulgarians, however, managed to turn the game over with a swerving free kick by Hristo Stoichkov and a flying header by Yordan Lechkov, giving them a 2–1 win. In the semi-finals, they controversially lost 2–1 to Italy. Stoichkov scored Bulgaria&#x27;s only goal in the first half to tally his seventh goal, which led the tournament. In the second half, Bulgaria were waved off on a non-penalty call in which an Italian defender had clearly committed a handball in the box, off a Kostadinov cross. Instead of playing in the final, it became a third place play-off. Bulgaria lost against Sweden 4–0, but the fourth-place finish was Bulgaria&#x27;s best performance in history to that point.

Hristo Stoichkov was awarded the Golden Boot shared with Oleg Salenko as the top scorer in the tournament with his six goals. Krasimir Balakov was named in the 1994 World Cup Dream Team along with Stoichkov. Later on in December, Stoichkov was awarded the 1994 Ballon d&#x27;Or trophy for his great skill and leadership, becoming the first Bulgarian and third Barcelona player to win it in history.

In 1996, the team qualified for the European Football Championship for the first time. They were drawn in Group B with France, Spain, and Romania. Bulgaria started with a 1–1 draw against the Spain. Stoichkov scored his second goal with a wonderful volley, ruled offside. Bulgaria defeated Romania 1–0 in the next group stage match. Stoichkov scored in the third minute. In the final group match, the Bulgarian side lost 3–1 against France; Stoichkov scored a free kick to give Bulgaria their only goal of the game, along with their only loss. At the same time, Spain defeated Romania 2–1, and Bulgaria were eliminated.

Bulgaria qualified for the 1998 World Cup in France by finishing first in Group 5, with decisive wins over Russia. They entered the competition with new manager Hristo Bonev. Bulgaria drew Spain, Nigeria, and Paraguay in Group D. The first match ended decently, in a goalless draw against eventual group runners up Paraguay. In the second match, the Bulgarians lost 1–0 for a second-straight World Cup to Nigeria. The final match ended with a 6–1 defeat to Spain. Following the bad results, Bulgaria finished fourth in the group, with only one point. This was the last World Cup appearance for Bulgaria.

Bulgaria was drawn in a tough qualifying group with teams England, Sweden, and Poland. The campaign started slow with a draw and a defeat by Poland and Sweden. The most memorable match for Bulgaria in the group was the 1–1 draw against England, which was also the last match for Stoichkov before his international retirement. Bulgaria finished fourth with eight points and failed to make the final stages of Euro 2000.

===Early 21st century===
Bulgaria was once again drawn into a tough group with Denmark and Czech Republic. The group was also the debut of Bulgaria&#x27;s top scoring legend Dimitar Berbatov. Bulgaria won the matches against the weaker teams, but lost once and drew once with both Denmark and the Czech Republic. Bulgaria finished third with 17 points, three points behind second-placed Czech Republic, thus failing to make the World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

Bulgaria managed to qualify for the Euro 2004 in Portugal by finishing first with wins over Croatia and Belgium. They drew Sweden, Italy, and Denmark in Group C. All three group stage matches ended up in losses for Bulgaria, with Martin Petrov being the team&#x27;s lone scorer in the country&#x27;s 1–2 loss to Italy.

Bulgaria failed to qualify for the World Cup in Germany after a run of poor results. They tied with Sweden and Croatia the first run but lost the other meetings to the two sides. Although Berbatov scored many goals in the qualifiers including a last-minute equalizer against Croatia, Bulgaria still finished third in qualifying with 15 points.

Bulgaria found themselves in a minor tournament in Japan known as the Kirin Cup. They started off well with a 2–1 victory over the hosts Japan. However, Bulgaria lost 5–1 to Scotland, the eventual cup champions. Bulgaria finished as the runners-up and received the silver medal.

Group G of Euro 2008 qualification had Netherlands, Romania, and Bulgaria attempting to qualify for Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria. Bulgaria performed well after a run of good results against Romania which gave them the first place. Bulgaria finished third in the group falling short on one point behind the Netherlands.
Bulgaria were drawn against Italy and Ireland in qualifying in Group 8. Bulgaria started the campaign with a series of draws. Manager Plamen Markov was replaced by Stanimir Stoilov in January 2009. The Bulgarians then recorded their first wins of the group over Cyprus, Montenegro and Georgia. They finished in third place with 14 points, therefore failing to qualify to a play-off spot.
Bulgaria were drawn in Group G along with England, Switzerland, Wales, and Montenegro. Bulgaria finished in last place in the group.

In the qualification phase for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, Bulgaria were placed in Group B together with the teams of Italy, Denmark, Czech Republic, Armenia and Malta. Under the guidance of former player Lyuboslav Penev as head coach, Bulgaria enjoyed a revival and some noteworthy performances in friendly matches before the start of the qualifying, including a 2–1 victory over 2010 World Cup runners-up Netherlands in Amsterdam. The qualifying began with a 2–2 draw against Euro 2012 runners-up Italy. Bulgaria then edged a tight match against Armenia, which ended 1–0. Next, Bulgaria drew 1–1 against Denmark. Four days later, Bulgaria earned a hard-fought 0–0 draw away to the Czech Republic. As a result, the team climbed from 96th in the FIFA World Rankings, their lowest position in history, to 40th in November 2012.

Penev&#x27;s players hosted and defeated Malta 6–0 under heavy snowfall. Four days later, Bulgaria drew Denmark 1–1 in Copenhagen. This result left Bulgaria second in the group with 10 points, still undefeated. Bulgaria traveled to Italy, losing 1–0. After a series of poor results, Bulgaria ended up failing to qualify for Brazil 2014.

Bulgaria were placed in a group with Italy, Croatia, Norway, Azerbaijan, and Malta. Bulgaria opened up their first match with a 2–1 victory over Azerbaijan. They were defeated 1–0 by Croatia, following another 2–1 defeat to Norway. To make it worse, Bulgaria drew with Malta 1–1 at home, which would cost manager Lyuboslav Penev his position. He was replaced by Ludogorets Razgrad manager Ivaylo Petev.

On his debut match, Petev&#x27;s squad drew Romania 0-0; this later led to a 2–2 draw with Italy, which Bulgaria led until a last-minute Italian equalizer. Bulgaria defeated Malta 1–0 to edge two points ever closer to the third place playoff position. After a series of losses, Bulgaria failed to qualify for Euro 2016 in France despite a 2–0 defeat of Azerbaijan.

Bulgaria were drawn in a strong World Cup qualification group with the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Belarus and Luxembourg. They began with a 4–3 win against Luxembourg at home. This was followed by heavy losses to France (4–1) and Sweden (3–0). 
In November 2016, the Lions beat Belarus in Sofia 1–0, and then put up one of their best performances in recent years, beating the Netherlands 2–0 to move into third place in the group. Bulgaria then beat the group leaders Sweden 3–2 in Sofia to move one point behind their opponents in the table. However, they lost the match against the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Arena 3–1. A 1–0 defeat at home to France and a 1–1 draw in Luxembourg ended their chances of qualifying.

===2018–present===
Bulgaria were drawn in UEFA Nations League C with Norway, Slovenia and Cyprus. Bulgaria opened up the campaign with a 2–1 win over Slovenia and a clean sheet against Norway. The Norwegians eventually avenged their loss to Bulgaria, resulting in a tie for first place. Bulgaria eventually closed out the second round of games with two 1–1 draws against Slovenia and Cyprus, resulting in a second-place finish.

Bulgaria was drawn in Group A with England, Czech Republic, Montenegro and Kosovo. The team began the qualifying campaign with a 1–1 home draw against Montenegro and a 1–1 away draw to Kosovo while losing three major players due to injuries. They later carried on with two more losses which sparked the end of their group campaign. Despite finishing in fourth place, the national side had one more opportunity to qualify for the Euros thanks to the good performance in the Nations League. It sent Bulgaria to the Path A qualifying play-offs, which also included Hungary, Iceland and Romania.

The draw put Bulgaria against Hungary in their first play-off match on their quest to qualify for a major competition since 2004. However, in front of limited number of home fans, Bulgaria fell 1–3 to Hungary, and was eliminated from the tournament.

After appointing Georgi Dermendzhiev as their new head coach, Bulgaria began their brief promotion in League B. Being drawn into Group 4 with Wales, Finland and Republic of Ireland, Bulgaria played its first match against Ireland. A near victory for the Bulgarians until a 90th minute injury time equalizer sealed the draw for the Irish. Bulgaria would then play away to Wales, where they held the hosts leveled 0–0 until another 90th minute injury time goal that resulted in 0–1 loss. The problems would continue with another set of narrow losses to Finland and Wales, forcing Bulgaria to miss out on promotion to League A. With two more matches left, Bulgaria finished winless against Finland and Ireland, relegating the Lions to League C.

Yasen Petrov was hired as the coach prior to the qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup. Bulgaria began the campaign horribly, losing at home 1–3 to Switzerland and 0–2 to Italy. The team somewhat improved in the next two games, drawing away at Northern Ireland and Italy, the reigning European champions. Bulgaria then beat Lithuania 1–0 at home, but lost 1–3 away against the same team, ending their hopes for qualification. A 2–1 home win against Northern Ireland was only a brief moment of rejoice before a heavy 0–4 defeat to Switzerland ended a largely miserable attempt for qualifying.

Bulgaria was allocated to League C for the League of Nations season, after relegation from the previous edition. Bulgaria&#x27;s opponents were drawn to be North Macedonia, Georgia and Gibraltar. The campaign began with a 1–1 draw against North Macedonia at home, followed by a heavy 2–5 loss against Georgia at home. Yasen Petrov handed his resignation following the game. Georgi Ivanov was appointed as interim manager for the next two games against Gibraltar and Georgia. Another shameful performance followed, when the Lions drew 1–1 in Gibraltar, which was one of only few times that the Gibraltar national team had not lost a competitive game in its history. In Georgia, Bulgaria drew 0–0, extending the winless streak to four games. During the one month pause of the tournament, Serbian Mladen Krstajić was appointed as manager. Under his reins, Bulgaria recorded two wins against Gibraltar at home and North Macedonia away, eventually finishing second in the group. The game against North Macedonia was particularly intense, due to rising political tensions between the two countries at that time. The Bulgarian national anthem was heavily booed, followed by multiple provocations from both Macedonian fans and players aimed at the Bulgarian team.

==Team image==
Bulgaria&#x27;s traditional colours are white, green and red, taken from the colours of the country&#x27;s flag. This tricolour is reflected through the use of white shirts, green shorts, and red socks. The team&#x27;s away kits have usually been red.

Their nickname is The Lions, in tribute of the lions represented in the coat of arms of Bulgaria.

===Ultras and controversy===

In recent years, ultras of the Bulgarian team have developed a reputation for racism. After racist chanting and monkey noises directed at Ashley Young, Ashley Cole and Theo Walcott during a qualifier for Euro 2012, the Bulgarian Football Union was fined €40,000 by UEFA. The BFU denied that racism would be an issue during Euro 2020 qualifiers, claiming that the issue was worse in England. Nevertheless, Bulgarian ultras were accused of racist chants during their matches against Czech Republic, Kosovo and England. As a result, part of the Bulgarian stadium was closed off for the match against England (October 2019), and officials twice halted the game under the UEFA anti-racism protocol. In the following days since the match took place, Bulgarian police identified 15 fans they suspected were responsible for subjecting black English players including Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Tyrone Mings to racist abuse, arresting six of them.

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin condemned the alleged abuse calling on the &quot;football family and governments&quot; to &quot;wage war on the racists&quot;. Disciplinary proceedings have been launched against both Bulgaria and England.

==Home stadium==
Traditionally, the Bulgaria national football team&#x27;s home stadium is the Vasil Levski National Stadium with a capacity of 44,000. The stadium was officially opened in 1953 and reconstructed in 1966 and 2002. It is the second largest stadium in Bulgaria, behind the Plovdiv Stadium with a capacity of 55,000. During the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, the stadium was used for Levski Sofia matches with Barcelona, Chelsea, and Werder Bremen. Similarly, Ludogorets Razgrad used it as their main home venue for their European matches until the 2017–18 season. The Bulgaria national team&#x27;s home matches, Bulgarian Cup finals and the Eternal derby of Bulgaria are held at the venue, as well as athletics competitions.

The Huvepharma Arena in Razgrad has been occasionally hosting the national team&#x27;s matches since 2018. Opened in 1954 and renovated in 2011, the stadium has a capacity of 10,422.

Recently, the national team relocated to the freshly renovated Hristo Botev Stadium in Plovdiv, with a capacity of 18,777.

<text>The Uruguay national football team (), nicknamed La Celeste (&quot;The Sky Blue&quot;), have represented Uruguay in international men&#x27;s football since their first international match in 1902 and is administered by the Uruguayan Football Association, the governing body for football in Uruguay, which is affiliated with CONMEBOL and comes under the global jurisdiction of world football&#x27;s governing body FIFA. Uruguay&#x27;s home stadium is the Estadio Centenario, and they have been coached by Marcelo Bielsa since 2023.

Considered one of the most successful national teams in international competitions and by FIFA as &quot;football&#x27;s first global powerhouse,&quot; Uruguay has won four world FIFA-organized competitions, two Olympic titles and two FIFA World Cups. Their first two senior world titles came at the Olympic tournaments of Paris 1924 and Amsterdam 1928, two events that were directly organized by FIFA as open tournaments that included professionals. In 1924, La Celeste beat Switzerland 3–0 in the final. Then, in 1928, Uruguay repeated the Olympic championship by beating Argentina 2–1. They then secured a third consecutive title at the inaugural FIFA World Cup in Montevideo, where they beat Argentina 4–2 in the decisive match. Uruguay&#x27;s fourth title came in 1950 after beating hosts Brazil in the final match 2–1, a match that still holds the record for the highest official attendance for a football match ever (173,850 people at the gate). Additionally, Uruguay has won the Copa América 15 times, second only to Argentina for the most titles in the tournament&#x27;s history, winning their most recent title in 2011.

Uruguay has developed many rivalries through the years, with the most notable ones being with neighboring countries Argentina—known as the &quot;Clásico del Río de la Plata&quot; based on their geographical location and cultural similarities, and Brazil—known as the &quot;Clásico del Río Negro&quot; in reference to the 1950 FIFA World Cup final known to football fans as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot;. Uruguay&#x27;s rivalries in recent history also include with Australia, having met twice in the playoffs of the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification campaigns, as well as Ghana, whom they encountered in the 2010 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.

==History==

=== Uruguay&#x27;s rise to prominence on the global stage ===

The first official match played by Uruguay was held at the Paso del Molino on 20 July 1902 against Argentina. In that match, Argentina beat the Uruguayan side 6–0 in front of 8,000 spectators. Prior to 1916, Uruguay played more than 30 matches, of which all but one were against Argentina. The inaugural Copa America of 1916 saw Uruguay win against Chile and Brazil, along with a draw against Argentina, to win their first major tournament. At the 1917 South American Championship, Uruguay hosted the competition and retained the title by winning every match. The 1919 Copa América saw Uruguay&#x27;s first loss in the tournament, a 1–0 defeat in a playoff with Brazil which went to two periods of extra time, the longest Copa América match in history.
After winning the 1924 South American Championship, Uruguay traveled to Paris as the first South American team to compete in the Olympic Games. The 1924 Olympic Football tournament also had the distinction of being the first ever &quot;open&quot; championship for professionals, as well as directly being organized by Caetano Heras Manuel Fiochetta and FIFA. Hence, the tournament would be recognized at the time (and also afterwards) as equivalent in value to the FIFA World Cup. Uruguay would eliminate Yugoslavia, United States, France, Netherlands and finally Switzerland to become football&#x27;s first senior professional world champions. Moreover, after winning the final, Uruguay inadvertently invented the tradition of the lap of honour to thank the fans in Paris. In the 1928 Olympic football tournament, Uruguay would retain their world title after beating Netherlands, Germany, Italy and lastly Argentina 2–1 in the replay of the final (the first match was a draw after extra time).
Following the double Olympic triumph, Uruguay was chosen as the host nation for the inaugural FIFA World Cup held in 1930, the centenary of Uruguay&#x27;s first constitution. During this tournament, Uruguay won all its matches against Peru, Romania and Yugoslavia. In the final, La Celeste turned a 1–2 halftime deficit into a 4–2 victory against neighbours Argentina at the Estadio Centenario to capture their consecutive third world title. After this tournament, Uruguay would boycott the World Cup of 1934 due to the refusal of some European teams to participate in the 1930 edition. For the 1938 World Cup, France was chosen as host, contrary to a previous agreement to alternate the championships between South America and Europe, so Uruguay again refused to participate.

Uruguay&#x27;s golden generation retired after winning the 1935 South American Championship, beating Argentina 3–0 in the final. This was this generation&#x27;s overall 7th title, which is still the record for most major titles in international football history, counting the 4 South American (1917, &#x27;23, &#x27;24, &#x27;26) and three world titles (1924, &#x27;28, 30).

===1940s–1960s===

In the 1940s, Uruguay achieved early success in a decade largely dominated by Argentina by winning their eighth South American championship in 1942. As the World Cup was not being played, this championship became the priority.

In 1950, Uruguay re-entered the World Cup for the first time since 1930. This time, La Celeste would enter a final-group where they would tie Spain 2–2 and beat Sweden 3–2 on route to the final match against hosts Brazil. On 16 July 1950, Uruguay claimed their second FIFA World Cup and fourth senior world title when they beat Brazil 2–1 from behind in an iconic match known as the &quot;Maracanazo&quot; in front of a record paying crowd of 173,850. Though, historical estimates indicate that the crowd reached well over 200,000. This feat became an integral part of Uruguay&#x27;s football identity and a source of inspiration for upcoming footballers with each passing generation.

In the 1954 World Cup, Uruguay reached the semi-final for the fourth time after a notable campaign beating Czechoslovakia, Scotland and England. The semi-final against Hungary is still considered one of the best matches in World Cup history, as La Celeste dramatically tied the match 2–2 late after trailing 2–0 at halftime. Uruguay would finally lose 4–2 in extra-time in what was their first-ever loss at the global stage, a thirty year record that started in January, 1925.

Afterwards, Uruguay would fail to qualify to the World Cup for the first time in the 1958 CONMEBOL Qualifiers after losing 5–0 to Paraguay in Asuncion. From there, Uruguay maintained a competitive generation through the 1960s and into the early 1970s with players from Nacional and Peñarol, who had won several continental and club world titles during that time. In 1962, Uruguay had a relatively poor World Cup, being eliminated in the group stage after a dramatic last match against the Soviet Union. In 1966, Uruguay reached the last eight after drawing hosts England beating France in the group stage. A controversial quarter-final loss against West Germany marred what had been seen as a positive campaign. La Celeste would end the decade winning their 11th South American championship in 1967 by beating Argentina 1–0 in Montevideo.

===1970s–1980s===
In 1970, Uruguay established themselves again as one of the world&#x27;s best teams when they advanced to their fourth World Cup semi-final in Mexico 1970, losing to eventual winners Brazil. After that came the biggest downturn in the country&#x27;s footballing history as they were eliminated in the group stage of the 1974 World Cup, and failed to qualify to Argentina 1978. It wasn&#x27;t until the late 1970s that Uruguayan football began to see hope as their under-20 team won four consecutive South American titles from 1975 to 1981, as well as reaching the U20 World Cup semi-final in 1979.
The success of this young generation would bear fruit in the 1980s, which began with Uruguay winning the 1980 World Champions&#x27; Gold Cup, a tournament that pitted past World Cup winners together in celebration of the tournament&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Afterwards, La Celeste went on to win the 1983 and 1987 Copas America back-to-back, only losing 1–0 to hosts Brazil in 1989&#x27;s decisive title match. After failing to qualify for the 1982 World Cup, in 1986, Uruguay were eliminated in the Round of 16 against eventual champions Argentina after a group stage that included West Germany, Denmark and Scotland.

===1990s–2000s===
In the 1990 World Cup in Italy, Uruguay were eliminated in the Round of 16 against hosts Italy 2–0 in Rome. Afterwards, Uruguay would fail to qualify for 1994 after losing 2–0 to Brazil in decisive match at Maracanã Stadium. La Celeste would win their next big encounter against the Brazilians when they beat the reigning world champions to win the 1995 Copa America in Montevideo. Later, Uruguay were eliminated from the 1998 World Cup as they finished in seventh place in the first time qualifying had been done in one group.

For the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, Uruguay managed to advance to a final playoff round against Australia to reach the finals. La Celeste would win the decisive match 3–0 in Montevideo to qualify to their first World Cup since 1990. The campaign itself proved a frustrating affair, as Uruguay were narrowly eliminated in the last group match against Senegal after drawing them 3–3, after being down 3–0 at half-time.

The 2006 World Cup qualifying campaign saw another international playoff against Australia. This time, La Celeste were eliminated on penalties in Sydney. This loss led to a profound paradigm shift with the hiring of Oscar Tabarez as manager. From there, Uruguay would finish semi finalists of the 2007 Copa America, and successfully qualified to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

===2010s–2022===
In 2010, a new generation of footballers, led by Luis Suárez, Diego Forlán and Edinson Cavani, formed a team that finishing fourth in the 2010 World Cup. Uruguay opened the tournament with a goalless draw against France, followed by wins against South Africa (3–0) and Mexico (1–0) respectively, finishing at the top of their group with seven points. In the second round, they played South Korea, defeating them 2–1 with star striker Luis Suárez scoring a brace and earning Uruguay a spot in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1970. Against Ghana, the match finished 1–1, forcing the game into extra-time. Both sides had their chances at extra time but Suárez blocked the ball with his hand in the penalty area, earning Suárez a red card and earning Uruguay universal scorn. Ghana striker Asamoah Gyan missed the subsequent penalty, forcing the game to go into penalties where Uruguay would win 4–2, sending them into the last four. They played the Netherlands in the semi-finals but were beaten 3–2. For the third-place match, they played Germany, again losing 3–2. This placed Uruguay in fourth place for the tournament, their best result in 40 years. Forlán was awarded the Player of The Tournament.
A year later, they won the Copa America for the first time in 16 years and broke the record for the most successful team in South America. Luis Suárez ended up as the Player of The Tournament.
Three years later, Uruguay was placed in Group D at the 2014 World Cup alongside Costa Rica, England, and Italy. They were upset by Costa Rica in the opening match, losing 3–1 after taking the lead in the first half. They rebounded with a 2–1 victory over England, in which Suárez scored a brace right after coming back from an injury, and a 1–0 victory over Italy, placing them second in their group and earning a spot in the last 16. During the match against Italy, forward Luis Suárez bit Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini on his left shoulder. Two days after the match, the FIFA Disciplinary Committee banned Suárez for nine international matches, the longest such ban in World Cup history, exceeding the eight-match ban handed to Italy&#x27;s Mauro Tassotti for breaking the nose of Spain&#x27;s Luis Enrique in 1994. Suárez was also banned from taking part in any football-related activity (including entering any stadium) for four months and fined CHF100,000 (approx. £65,700/€82,000/US$119,000). In the round of 16, Uruguay played Colombia but were beaten 2–0, eliminating them from the tournament.

At the 2015 and 2016 Copa América, Uruguay, missing banned striker Luis Suárez, were eliminated in the quarter-finals and group stages respectively.

After a successful World Cup qualifying campaign, finishing second, Uruguay made it to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Uruguay won its group after three victories, and advanced to the quarter-finals after a 2–1 win over Portugal. However, they were eliminated 2–0 in the quarter-finals by the eventual champions France.

At the 2022 World Cup, Uruguay was drawn into Group H with Portugal, Ghana and South Korea. They started the tournament with a 0–0 draw against South Korea, before they fell to a 2–0 defeat to Portugal. Despite a 2–0 victory against Ghana in their final group game, Uruguay was knocked out of the tournament in the group stages for the first time since 2002, on goals scored following South Korea’s shock 2–1 win against Portugal.

===Kits and crest===
Between 1901 and 1910, Uruguay wore a variety of different shirts during its matches. The first shirt worn was Albion F.C.&#x27;s kit, in the unofficial debut of the national team against Argentina in 1901. It was followed by a variety of shirts, including a solid green one and even a shirt with the colours of the Artigas flag.

On 10 April 1910, now-defunct club River Plate defeated Argentine side Alumni 2–1. That day River Plate wore its alternate jersey, a light blue one due to the home jersey was similar to Alumni&#x27;s. Ricardo LeBas proposed Uruguay to wear a light blue jersey as a tribute to the victory of River Plate over Alumni. This was approved by president of the Uruguayan Association, Héctor Gómez. The light blue (&quot;Celeste&quot;) jersey debuted in a Copa Lipton match against Argentina on 15 August 1910.

The red shirt that was used in some previous away strips was first used at the 1935 South American championship, held in Santa Beatriz in Peru, which Uruguay won. It was not worn again (except for a 1962 FIFA World Cup match, against Colombia) until 1991, when it was officially adopted as the away jersey.

Uruguay displays four stars in its emblem. This is unique in world football as two of the stars represent the gold medals received at the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, which are the only editions recognised by FIFA as senior world championships. In 2021, after a FIFA employee contacted PUMA about modifying the team&#x27;s crest, FIFA reconfirmed and approved once again the use of all four stars on the shirt.

===Home stadium===
Since 1930, Uruguay have played their home games at the Estadio Centenario in the Uruguayan capital Montevideo. The stadium was built as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguay&#x27;s first constitution, and had a capacity of 90,000 when first fully opened. The stadium hosted several matches in the 1930 World Cup, including the final, which was watched by a crowd of 93,000.

=== Rivalries ===
====Argentina====

First played in 1902, the &quot;Clasico de Rio de la Plata&quot; with Argentina is the oldest international derby in world football outside of the UK. Both teams have played in historically significant matches, such as the two world finals of 1928 and the inaugural World Cup final in 1930. They also disputed 8 South American Championship title deciders between 1916–1967. Although Argentina has an overall better head to head record, Uruguay have a better tally when it comes to international title deciders with 10 wins and 1 loss.

====Brazil====

Uruguay vs. Brazil dates back to the 1916 South American Championship. Both teams have since competed in several Copa America title deciders and the iconic 1950 World Cup final match, where Uruguay lifted their second FIFA World Cup in front of a world record crowd in Maracana. The only other time they met in a World Cup was the 1970 World Cup semi-final where Brazil won 3–1 in Guadalajara. Since the 1980s, the two sides met in several title deciders, such as the 1980 World Champions&#x27; Gold Cup final (won by Uruguay), and the 1983, 1989, 1995 and 1999 Copa América finals. Uruguay would win the 1983 and 1995 editions, while Brazil won in 1989 and 1999. Also in the 1990s, in a decisive World Cup qualifier, Brazil eliminated Uruguay in Maracana from qualifying for USA 1994. Since the 2000s, they have met mostly in the Copa América, as well as the regularly scheduled World Cup qualifiers.

<text>Saltney is a town straddling the counties of Flintshire and Cheshire on the England–Wales border. The local government community of Saltney lies entirely in Wales, while the English areas are unparished. The town forms part of Chester&#x27;s built-up area and is around 5 miles from Deeside.

Saltney is located next to the River Dee. In the 2001 census the population of the town was 4,769, rising to 5,132 at the time of the 2011 census.

==Location==
Higher Saltney, known locally as &quot;Top Saltney&quot; is in Chester, Cheshire. The Welsh sector of the community is known as Saltney, and is known as &quot;Saltney&quot; in Welsh as well.
The England–Wales border runs down the middle of Boundary Lane, the only urban street in England and Wales where this happens. Houses on the west side of the street are in the Flintshire County Council area and in the North Wales Police jurisdiction, while those on the east side are in the Cheshire West and Chester unitary authority area and in the Cheshire Police jurisdiction. in terms of policing, this refers to operations jurisdiction not legal jurisdiction. Officers from both forces have full legal jurisdiction throughout England &amp; Wales therefore the border is largely immaterial for practical purposes.
The west side is in the Alyn and Deeside parliamentary constituency and the east is in the City of Chester electoral division.

==History==
Saltney&#x27;s name is derived from the former salt marshes by the River Dee on which it is built. Once the terminus of Sir John Glynne&#x27;s Canal, Saltney grew in the late 19th century and through the 20th century to its present population of over 5,000. Saltney Ferry railway station was open between 1891 and 1962.

 is an old Welsh name for the area.

Saltney was a location for shipbuilding and in particular chain-making and the manufacture of anchors. The firm Henry Wood &amp; Company was first to establish an engineering works on the west bank of the Dee in 1847, with further industrial development continuing into the 1880s. 
Henry Wood&#x27;s legacy is implemented with Wood Memorial CP School being named after him.

==Amenities==
There is a public house called The City Arms in Higher Saltney. Other amenities in Saltney include the Corner Pin public house, a post office, Saltney Business Centre, St David&#x27;s Retail Park and the Asda and Morrisons supermarkets.

Saltney has three primary schools, St Anthony&#x27;s Catholic Primary, Saltney Ferry C.P. and Wood Memorial. St David&#x27;s High School is the local secondary school for students from the surrounding areas.

The Anglican parish church is St Mark&#x27;s which is in Higher Saltney. On the High Street can be found St Anthony of Padua Catholic Church and Saltney Methodist Church.

There is a community centre in the centre of Saltney which is regularly used by children&#x27;s groups as well as being surrounded by fields where football tournaments are often held. The Community Centre is also home to Saltney Town FC who formed in 2010.

<doc id="679791" wikidata="Q2402777" url="?curid=679791" title="Power Stone 2">
<text>is a multiplayer fighting game developed and published by Capcom. It was released for the Sega NAOMI arcade system in April 2000, with a home port for the Dreamcast releasing later that year. It is the sequel to &quot;Power Stone&quot; (1999), and built on the innovative gameplay introduced by its predecessor. &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; allows up to four players to choose from multiple characters and utilize items such as tables, chairs, and rocks in battle. The game introduced changes from the original, including new character voices, the removal of the existing combo system and a new, horizontal status bar. 

The game was ported to the PlayStation Portable as part of the &quot;Power Stone Collection&quot; in 2006. The arcade version is also set to be re-released in 2025 as part of &quot;Capcom Fighting Collection 2&quot;.

==Gameplay==
There are four different modes available for the game:
*1-on-1: Much like the original &quot;Power Stone&quot;, a two-character storyline game.
*Arcade: A four-character storyline game, with two characters advancing each round.
*Original: Multiplayer mode, with free choice of characters and stages.
*Adventure: An unpredictable storyline game, where players can collect items, cards and money.

&quot;Power Stone 2&quot; offers five interactive 3-D stages to begin with, plus the two boss stages which players can also access in Original mode. All but the Original mode is played out like a storyline, where two battles are fought on the regular stages, followed by the Pharaoh Walker boss, then another battle, and ending with the Dr. Erode boss stage. Three extra stages may be unlocked for Original mode by meeting certain requirements in Arcade mode, as well as a desert area stage, which is essentially the Pharaoh Walker boss stage, but without the boss. Though each player has their own set of default ground and air attacks, the character can execute more powerful fusion attacks after collecting three Power Stones and transforming. Players cannot directly block incoming attacks, but can dodge by tapping on the control pad just before an enemy attacks.

Most of the stages are dynamic and will change as the battle progresses. For example, the airplane stage starts out on a warplane. After a set amount of time, the plane will fall apart, forcing all the players to battle while skydiving toward the ground. Shortly after, the players will fall onto a floating platform, where the remainder of the battle will be held. This, in essence, creates three sub-stages within a single one.

Each stage is also littered with item boxes, which hold a random item that a player has acquired and unlocked in Adventure mode or created in the Item Shop. They may also contain Power Stones. Items are extremely diverse. Damaging items range from guns, flamethrowers, gigantic hammers, a wide assortment of swords, to bear traps, roller blades, and even a magazine that can be thrown. Non-damaging items include food that will replenish health, shields for defense, elixirs for invisibility, adhesive sprays to slow your opponents, and wings for extra jumps. Cards that can be used to mix items can also be found in Adventure mode. Furthermore, most stages also have their own collection of unique items and fixtures that the player can use. For example, the submarine level comes with turrets, small airplanes to drop bombs, and icebergs to throw at opponents. Each level is also highly interactive, as players can use many of the stage elements themselves. All players can also gain extra height by jumping off a wall.

===Item Shop===
New to &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; is the &quot;Adventure&quot; mode. This mode is functionally identical to the &quot;1-on-1&quot; and &quot;Arcade&quot; modes; however, there is an additional inventory filled with items and money that the player has collected. These may then be taken to the game&#x27;s &quot;Item Shop&quot;, run by secret character Mel. The overall goal of the Item Shop is to allow players to gain access to new items; either by purchasing them, or by combining existing items in a &#x27;mixing&#x27; process. This gives the game considerable additional longevity, as many of the best or most entertaining items are available only from the Item Shop. 
&quot;Power Stone 2&quot; includes a VMU application called the Mini-Book. This can be used to inspect the player&#x27;s item inventory, or trade items with another player. Additionally, a player may register up to five items in their inventory as &quot;Handy Items&quot;. These may then appear to the player in Original mode, offering a tactical advantage.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Matt Sammons of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game&#x27;s Japanese import, &quot;An innovative and beautiful fighting game, &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; will keep you entertained for hours. Just make sure to bring along a few friends.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 31 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their June 15, 2000 issue as the seventeenth most-successful arcade game of the month.

Mike &quot;Major Mike&quot; Weigand of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the Dreamcast version in one review, &quot;Fans of the first &quot;Power Stone&quot; game should definitely check out this sequel. While it&#x27;s basically the &quot;more-of-the-same&quot; &quot;Power Stone&quot; engine of the first game, the extra characters, weapons, and play modes make &quot;Power Stone 2&quot; a top offering in the Dreamcast action/fighting genre.&quot; In another review, The Freshman said, &quot;&quot;Power Stone 2&quot; is everything you&#x27;ve hoped for since the original, with madcap action and four-player mayhem, but a little more depth and less confusion would have rounded this title out nicely. As it is, &quot;PS2&quot; is a great multiplayer title that should bring smiles to the faces of &quot;Power Stone&quot; junkies across the country.&quot;

<text>The Luxembourg national football team (nicknamed the &quot;Red Lions&quot;; , , ) is the national football team of Luxembourg, and is controlled by the Luxembourg Football Federation. The team plays most of its home matches at the Stade de Luxembourg in Luxembourg City.

Luxembourg has participated in every FIFA World Cup qualifiers since those for the 1934 World Cup and in UEFA European Championship qualifiers since those for Euro 1964. As of 2024, they have never qualified for any of these major tournaments. Luxembourg is the nation with the most qualifying campaigns in both of these competitions without ever making it to the finals. However, they did compete in six Olympic football events between 1920 and 1952.

==History==

Luxembourg played their first ever international match on 29 October 1911, in a friendly match against France; it resulted in a 1–4 defeat. Their first victory came on 8 February 1914, also in a match against France, which they won 5–4.

The national side of Luxembourg competed in six Olympic football events between 1920 and 1952, and survived the preliminary round twice (in 1948 and 1952). In between, Luxembourg started participating at qualifiers for the FIFA World Cup, but as of 2022 they have never qualified.

Starting in 1921, the Luxembourg national A-selection would play 239 unofficial international matches until 1981, mostly against other countries&#x27; B-teams like those of Belgium, France, Switzerland and West Germany, as well as a team representing South-Netherlands.

After their last Olympic tournament in 1952, the national team also started playing in qualifying groups for UEFA European Championships, but could not reach the major European tournament end stages. The only time that the team was close to qualify was for a European or World Championship was for the Euro 1964. In the first qualification round they defeated the Netherlands with a score of 3–2 on aggregate after two matches. A Dutch newspaper commented this stunt after the second match with &quot;David Luxembourg won with 2–1 [against Goliath Netherlands]&quot;. In the round of eight, Luxembourg and Denmark fought for a spot in the final tournament. The winner was decided after three matches; Denmark was the winner with a total aggregate score of 6–5.

When the national team does win a competitive match, they are often celebrated by national media and fans, as was the case after a 2–1 win against Switzerland in 2008.

On 3 September 2017, Luxembourg held France to a 0–0 draw at Stadium Municipal in Toulouse, France. It was the first time France had failed to win against Luxembourg since 1914, when Luxembourg won, 5–4. On 10 November 2017, Luxembourg pulled off an upset by defeating Hungary 2–1 in a friendly.

On 28 March 2021, Luxembourg beat the Republic of Ireland in a 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification match with a goal from Gerson Rodrigues in the 85th minute. In 2023, Luxembourg achieved some of their best results in European Championship qualifying, finishing third in their group (of six teams) and qualifying for a play-off for a finals berth, but they lost 2–0 to Georgia. Rodrigues also became the top goal scorer in the history of the national team, surpassing the 16-goal tally by Léon Mart, by scoring 5 goals during the qualifying process, also a record for a Luxembourgish player.

==Kit==
Traditionally, the badge on Luxembourg&#x27;s team outfit displays a shield very similar to Luxembourg&#x27;s lesser coat of arms, a red lion on a white-blue striped background – hence the team&#x27;s nickname &quot;Red Lions&quot;. In modern times, the team played home games in entirely red strips, in accordance with their nickname, and wore white as away colour.

==Home stadium==

As of 1 September 2021, the Luxembourg national team adopted Luxembourg City&#x27;s, Stade de Luxembourg the country&#x27;s national stadium, as its home venue. Formerly, the team played at the Stade Josy Barthel, where, at counting in August 2015, it had played 235 games, including unofficial matches. It is also used for rugby union and athletics.

<doc id="679799" wikidata="Q188568" url="?curid=679799" title="North Macedonia national football team">
<text>The North Macedonia national football team () represents North Macedonia in men&#x27;s international football, and is administered by the Football Federation of Macedonia. The team play their home matches at the Toše Proeski National Arena in Skopje.

North Macedonia has reached Euro 2020 (its first major tournament) and the European qualifying play-off final of the 2022 World Cup (after defeating Germany in Duisburg and Italy in Palermo).

==History==
Between 1945 and 1991, SR Macedonia was ineligible to play as a team for official matches. The team had mostly played exhibition matches against teams from other republics of SFR Yugoslavia and was represented by Macedonian players under the traditional red, yellow and white colors.

===Early years (1991–96)===

They had their first official international match as a 4–1 victory against Slovenia in a friendly on 13 October 1993 under coach Andon Dončevski. In 1994, the Republic of Macedonia became a single member of FIFA and UEFA after the independence and split of the Yugoslavia federal team.

====Euro 1996 qualifiers====

The national team had its last test before the start of the first official qualification match. They faced Turkey on 31 August 1994 at Skopje city Park stadium losing their first official match 0–2. 

The Euro &#x27;96 qualifiers was the first major qualifying tournament that Macedonia participated in as an independent nation, grouped with Spain, Denmark, Belgium, Cyprus and Armenia. In their opening game, which was also their first ever official match, Macedonia played the reigning European champions Denmark, finishing 1–1 after Macedonia led for most of the game. In Euro &#x27;96 qualifying, Macedonia suffered one of its worst-ever defeats, 5–0 to Belgium on 7 June 1995. They failed to qualify for Euro &#x27;96, finishing fourth in the group with seven points.

=== Hadžievski, Kanatlarovski and Jovanovski&#x27;s era (1996–2001) ===
====1998 World Cup qualifiers====

Macedonia&#x27;s first qualifying attempt for the World Cup saw them grouped with Romania, Republic of Ireland, Lithuania, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

The tournament began on 24 April 1996 with a 3–0 win at home against Liechtenstein. On 9 November 1996, Macedonia recorded their biggest ever, an 11–1 thrashing of Liechtenstein. Macedonia defeated the Republic of Ireland 3–2 at home, their first win over a major European team, but failed again to qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France, finishing fourth in the group on 13 points.

====Euro 2000 qualifiers====

Macedonia&#x27;s journey to qualify for the Euro 2000 tournament in the Netherlands and Belgium saw them grouped with FR Yugoslavia, Republic of Ireland, Croatia, and Malta. They once again opened their qualifying campaign with a win after beating Malta 4–0 at home on 6 September 1998. Their most notable result in the campaign was a 1–1 draw against Croatia in June 1999, with an equalizer of Georgi Hristov 10 minutes before the end of the game. They helped Yugoslavia to qualify directly and eliminate Croatia because they drew 1–1 against the Republic of Ireland with a last-minute equalizer of Goran Stavrevski. However, they failed to qualify again, finishing fourth in the group with eight points.

====2002 World Cup qualifiers====

Macedonia&#x27;s 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign saw them grouped with Sweden, Turkey, Slovakia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan. They were unsuccessful in their opening match, going down to Slovakia 2–0 in Bratislava on 3 September 2000. The Macedonians once again failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup as they finished fourth in the group with seven points.

=== Ups and downs (2001–06) ===
====Euro 2004 qualifiers====

The Euro 2004 Qualifiers saw Macedonia grouped alongside England, Turkey, Slovakia, and Liechtenstein.
Macedonia played England in Southampton, England&#x27;s first home game in Southampton in almost 100 years. Macedonia grabbed the lead early in the first half after Artim Šakiri scored directly from a corner kick. England soon leveled the game, before Macedonia led again. The game eventually ended 2–2. Macedonia lost to England 2–1 at home in the return leg, which took place in September 2003. Macedonia&#x27;s only win of the campaign came on 7 June 2003, when they beat Liechtenstein 3–1 at home.

====2006 World Cup qualifiers====

Macedonia was drawn in Group 1 and was grouped with the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Romania, Finland, Armenia, and Andorra. They managed to open their campaign with a comfortable 3–0 win at home against Armenia on 18 August 2004. Macedonia did not win another home game for more than three years.

On 9 October 2004, Macedonia managed to hold the Netherlands to a surprise 2–2 draw in Skopje in front of a crowd of 17,000 at the Skopje City Stadium, but just four days later, they suffered a 1–0 loss away to Andorra. Macedonia then set a new team record for most goals conceded in a game when they lost 6–1 away to the Czech Republic in June 2005.

Macedonia went on to concede a further eight goals in the next two qualifying games, both against Finland. On 23 August 2005, coach Slobodan Santrač resigned as coach of Macedonia after just five months due to personal problems, with former player Boban Babunski temporarily taking over as coach. The resignation came just days after they were beaten 3–0 by Finland in Skopje. Despite failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, Macedonia was the only team in the group to not lose against the Netherlands.

====Iran tournament====
Following the completion of the 2006 World Cup qualifying tournament, in November 2005, Macedonia took part in a friendly tournament in Iran consisting of four teams: Macedonia, Iran, Paraguay, and Togo. In their opening match, they won 2–1 against host nation Iran, booking a spot in the final against Paraguay, where they lost 1–0.

=== Srečko Katanec&#x27;s era and best FIFA ranking (2006–10) ===
====Euro 2008 qualifiers====
On 17 February 2006, former Slovenian national team coach Srečko Katanec was appointed as the head coach and was given a two-year contract.

In the lead-up to the beginning of the qualifiers for Euro 2008, Macedonia managed two wins in friendlies, against Ecuador 2–1 in Madrid, and 1–0 Turkey. Macedonia was placed in Group E for the Euro 2008 qualifiers alongside England, Croatia, Russia, Israel, Estonia, and Andorra.

Macedonia opened its UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying campaign with a 1–0 win away to Estonia on 16 August 2006. Macedonia hosted England on 6 September in their second game of the qualifiers. England went on to win 1–0; this was the first time that Macedonia failed to score against England.

A month later, on 7 October 2006, the two teams met once again in Manchester, where England was held to a 0–0 draw in front of 72,062 people. On 17 October 2007, Macedonia recorded their first win on home soil since August 2004 when they defeated Andorra 3–0 in Skopje.

Macedonia then recorded one of their most impressive wins to date when they picked up a 2–0 victory over eventual group winners Croatia on 17 November 2007; it was also a first win for Macedonia over a side that was ranked in the top ten of the FIFA World Rankings. Despite this, Macedonia failed to qualify for Euro 2008 after finishing fifth in the group with 14 points.

====2010 World Cup qualifiers====
On 25 November 2007, just days after Macedonia completed its qualifying campaign for Euro 2008, the groups for European qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were held in Durban, South Africa, where Macedonia was seeded in Pot 4 and grouped along with the Netherlands, Scotland, Norway and Iceland. Manager Srečko Katanec received a two-year extension on 21 December 2007, which meant he would be under contract through the end of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers. In the lead up to the campaign, Macedonia played three friendlies against Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Poland, which all ended in draws.

Macedonia opened their campaign with a 1–0 home win against Scotland on 6 September 2008 when Ilčo Naumoski scored on a rebound after a missed free kick by Goce Sedloski. Following these impressive results, they moved up 10 places to 46th in the FIFA world rankings for October 2008 which was their highest ever ranking. However, Katanec resigned following a 4–0 loss to the Netherlands in Amsterdam in April 2009, allegedly for getting into an argument with Goran Pandev.

Soon afterwards, the manager of the under-21 team, Mirsad Jonuz, took the helm and remained until the end of the World Cup qualifying campaign. On 12 August 2009, a friendly match against Spain was held at the newly built City Park Stadium in Skopje. The defending European champions won 3–2 after being 2–0 down at halftime. In September, Macedonia lost 2–0 to Scotland and then to Norway.

=== Fall and resurgence (2010–2018) ===
====Euro 2012 qualifiers====

Macedonia was placed in Group B for the Euro 2012 qualifiers alongside Russia, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Armenia and Andorra. In the lead up to the qualifiers, an under-strength Macedonia side played friendlies against Azerbaijan, Romania, and Malta, winning the first two 3–1 and 1–0 respectively, and tied 1–1 against Malta later the summer.

Macedonia finished in fifth in the group with only two wins against minnows Andorra and two draws, against Armenia and Slovakia, both at home. Manager Mirsad Jonuz was dismissed on 18 June 2011 and replaced by John Toshack.

====2014 World Cup qualifiers====

Macedonia&#x27;s 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign saw them grouped with Croatia, Serbia, Belgium, Scotland and Wales. In August 2012, prior to the qualifiers, John Toshack resigned and was replaced by Čedomir Janevski. The national team would begin the qualification round with a loss to Croatia in Zagreb and would go on to draw against Scotland in Glasgow. They lost again to Croatia and won against Serbia in Skopje after a penalty kick taken by Agim Ibraimi. Later in qualification, the national team would go on to lose twice to the eventual group winners Belgium.

Macedonia would beat Wales and lose against Scotland at home. Around the end of September 2013, Janevski would leave the team for Belgian club R.A.E.C. Mons and would be replaced by Zoran Stratev for the last two matches. Away losses to Wales and Serbia meant they would finish last in their group.

After the run, Goran Pandev, Nikolče Noveski, Veliče Šumulikoski and others would retire from the national team due to turbulent relations with the Football Federation of Macedonia. In November 2013, Boško Gjurovski would be appointed the new national team manager.

====Euro 2016 qualifiers====

On 23 February 2014, Macedonia was placed in Group C for the Euro 2016 qualifiers alongside Spain, Ukraine, Slovakia, Belarus and Luxembourg. With 5–1 loss to Spain in Valencia, the only win they collected was against Luxembourg in Skopje.

After that match, Macedonia was brought into a run of a four losses; manager Boško Gjurovski was dismissed on 7 April 2015 and replaced by Ljubinko Drulović. Further losses came against Slovakia and surprisingly Luxembourg. Macedona drew their last match with Belarus in Barysaw, but still finished last in their group.

In October 2015, Drulović left the national team to join Serbian club Partizan and the manager place was taken over by the former manager of Rabotnički, Igor Angelovski. That same month, 2010 UEFA Champions League champion Goran Pandev came back to the national team after two years of absence.

Macedonia started with another disappointing performance with a loss to Albania in Shkodër, with a goal scored by Bekim Balaj in the last moments of the game, in a match that was played over two days because of interruption in the 76th minute due to weather. Later on they also lost to Israel at home after missing a penalty kick by Adis Jahović. After that, the national team also lost to Italy beside their 2–1 lead with the goals scored by Ilija Nestorovski and Ferhan Hasani. At the end of 2016, Macedonia was outclassed by Spain in Granada 4–0; Macedonia had not scored a single point, the worst qualifying start in the history of the national team.

Finally, in March 2017, Macedonia recorded their first win in qualifying against Liechtenstein, 3–0. Then they lost to Spain in Skopje 2–1. They also defeated Israel away through the lone goal by Goran Pandev, which was also a first ever win against Israel. Macedonia later tied Albania in Strumica 1–1.

North Macedonia then lost 2–0 away to Poland, and 2–1 away to Austria, ending up in third place.

On matchday 3, North Macedonia inflicted a 2–1 defeat on Germany in Duisburg, which was Germany&#x27;s first World Cup qualification defeat since 2001 and only the third in their history. In the last two games against Armenia and Iceland, North Macedonia won both (5–0 away against Armenia, 3–1 against Iceland) to put them in 2nd in Group J.

<text>There are many types of car body styles. They vary depending on intended use, market position, location, and the era they were made.

== Current styles ==
;Buggy: Lightweight off-road vehicle with sparse bodywork. Originally two- or four-wheeled carriages in the 19th and early 20th centuries pulled by one horse, the motorized buggies were developed in the 1960s and grew in popularity and diversity.

;Convertible / cabriolet : 
: Has a retractable or removable roof. A convertible allows an open-air driving experience, with the ability to provide a roof when required. Most convertible roofs are either a folding textile soft-top or a retractable metal roof. Convertibles with a metal roof are sometimes called &#x27;retractable hardtop&#x27;, &#x27;coupé convertible&#x27;, or &#x27;coupé cabriolet&#x27;.

;Coupé
: Two-door car, seating up to four persons. Some two-door cars are autonomous and have only two seats, thus two-passenger car. 


;Fastback
: Car with a roofline that slopes continuously down at the back. The design features a single unbroken convex curve from the roof to the rear.

;Flower car
: In the US used in the funeral industry to carry flowers for burial services. Typically a coupé-style, forward-passenger compartment with an open well in the rear.

;Hatchback / Liftback
: Car with a hatch-type rear door that is hinged at the roof and opens upwards. The term &quot;hatchback&quot; can also refer to that type of rear door, which is also used on several sports cars, SUVs, and large luxury cars.

;Hearse / funeral coach :
: The modification of a passenger car to provide a long cargo area for carrying a coffin or casket. Hearses often have large glass panels for viewing the coffin.

;Limousine:
: A luxury-type vehicle that is typically driven by a chauffeur with a partition between the driver&#x27;s compartment and the passenger&#x27;s compartment. Limousines may also be stretched to provide more room in the rear passenger compartment. In some European usage, the word describes a regular four-door sedan body style.

;Microvan:
:The smallest size of minivan/MPV.

;Minivan / multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) / people carrier / people mover :
: Vehicle designed to transport passengers in the rear seating row(s) with reconfigurable seats in two or three rows. Typically has a combined passenger and cargo area, a high roof, a flat floor, a sliding door for rear passengers, and high H-point seating. In Europe, some small minivans have been marketed as &#x27;leisure activity vehicles&#x27;.

;Panel van / car-derived van / sedan delivery :
: A cargo vehicle based upon passenger car chassis and typically has one row of seats with no side windows at the rear. Panel vans are smaller than panel trucks and cargo vans, both of which are built on a truck chassis.

;Panel truck :
: A pickup truck that has a fully enclosed truck topper in its back, giving it a van-like appearance.

;Pickup truck / pickup :
: A light-duty, open-bed truck. In South Africa, a pickup truck is called a &quot;bakkie&quot;.

;Roadster:
: An open two-seat car with emphasis on sporting appearance or character. Initially, an American term for a two-seat car with no weather protection, usage has spread internationally and has evolved to include two-seat convertibles.

;Sedan / saloon
: A fixed-roof car in a three-box design. These form separate compartments for engine, passenger, and cargo. Sedans can have two or four doors. A sedan is called a &quot;berlina&quot; in Spanish and Italian, or a &quot;berline&quot; in French.

;Shooting-brake:
: Initially, a horse-drawn vehicle used to carry shooting parties with their equipment and game; subsequently synonymous with station wagon / estate car; and in contemporary usage a three- or five-door wagon combining features of a station wagon and a coupé.

;Station wagon / estate car
: Has a two-box design, a large cargo area, and a rear tailgate that is hinged to open for access to the cargo area. The body style is similar to a hatchback car; however, station wagons are longer and are more likely to have the roofline extended to the rear of the car (resulting in a vertical rear surface to the car) to maximize the cargo space. In French, a station wagon is called a &quot;break&quot;.

;Targa top:
: A semi-convertible style used on some sports cars, featuring a fully removable soft or hard roof panel that leaves the A and B pillars in place on the car body.

;Ute / coupe utility :
: Based on a passenger sedan chassis and has a cargo tray in the rear integrated with the passenger body (as opposed to a pickup truck, which has a separate cargo tray). In Australia, the term &quot;ute&quot; was originally used solely for coupé utility cars; however, in recent years, it has also been used for pickup trucks.

== Historic styles ==
;Baquet 
: Has two rows of raised seats, similar to horse-drawn carriages; usually did not have front doors, a roof, or a windshield. The baquet (&quot;bathtub&quot;) style was produced in the early 1900s in Europe. 
:Also a marketing term used on cars built in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s.

;Barchetta 
: Italian two-seat sports car with either an open-top or convertible roof. The term was originally used for lightweight open-top racing cars from the late 1940s through the 1950s. Since the 1950s, the name barchetta (&quot;little boat&quot; in Italian) has been revived on several occasions, mostly for cars with convertible roofs that are not specifically intended for racing.

;Berlinetta
: Italian sports coupé, typically with two seats but also including 2+2 cars. The original meaning for berlinetta in Italian is &quot;little saloon.&quot;

;Cabrio coach
: A retractable textile roof, similar to a convertible/cabriolet. The difference is that where a convertible often has the B-pillar, C-pillar, and other bodywork removed, the cabrio-coach retains all bodywork to the top of the door frames and just replaces the roof skin with a retractable fabric panel.

;Coupé de ville / Sedanca de ville / town car 
: An external or open-topped driver&#x27;s position and an enclosed compartment for passengers. Produced from 1908 until 1939. Although the different terms may have once had specific meanings for certain car manufacturers or countries, the terms are often used interchangeably.
: Some coupé de villes have the passengers separated from the driver in a fully enclosed compartment, while others have a canopy for the passengers and no partition between the driver and the passengers (therefore passengers enter the compartment via the driver&#x27;s area).

;Hardtop
: Usually describes pillarless hardtops that are cars without a B-pillar often styled to give the appearance of a convertible. Popular in the United States from the mid 1950s through the mid 1970s.
: It also refers to a separate top that is removable and made of metal or other hard material for sports cars or small SUVs.

;Landaulet
: A car where the rear passengers are covered by a convertible top. Often the driver is separated from the rear passengers with a partition, as per a limousine.

;Personal luxury car
: American luxury coupés and convertibles produced from 1952 to 2007. The cars prioritized comfort, styling, and a high level of interior features.

;Phaeton
: An open-roof automobile without any fixed weather protection, which was popular from the 1900s until the 1930s.

;Roadster utility
: An open-topped roadster body and a rear cargo bed.

;Runabout
: A light, inexpensive, open car with basic bodywork and no windshield, top, or doors. Most runabouts had just a single row of seats, providing seating for two passengers.

;Torpedo
: Body style was a type of automobile body used from 1908 until the mid-1930s, which had a streamlined profile and a folding or detachable soft top. The design consists of a hood or bonnet line raised to be level with the car&#x27;s waistline, resulting in a straight beltline from front to back.

;Touring
: A style of open car built in the United States that seats four or more people. The style was popular from the early 1900s to the 1930s.

<text>Heshbon (also Hesebon, Esebon, Esbous, Esbus; , , &quot;Ḥešbōn&quot;, ) were at least two different ancient towns located east of the Jordan River in what is now the Kingdom of Jordan, historically within the territories of ancient Ammon.

The Bronze Age Heshbon of biblical King Sihon has not been identified. The town of Esbus from the Roman and Byzantine period has been identified with a tell (archaeological mound) known in Arabic as &quot;Tell Hisban&quot; or &quot;Tell Ḥesbān&quot;.

==Location of Tell Hisban==
The Roman and Byzantine town is believed to have been located at the ruin called Hesbân or Hisban, about southwest of Amman, and to the north of Madaba, on one of the highest summits of the mountains of Moab. A large ruined reservoir is located east of the place, and below the town there is a fountain.

==Biblical reference to Heshbon==
Ancient Heshbon was beyond, i.e. east of, the Jordan. The city was where the Israelites passed by on their entry to the Promised Land, and was assigned to the tribe of Reuben; afterwards it was given to the Tribe of Gad and became a Levitical city for the Merarites.

Heshbon is mentioned in the Tanakh in the Books of Numbers and Deuteronomy as the capital of Amorite king, Sihon (also known as Sehon). The biblical narrative records the story of the Israelite victory over Sihon during the time of the Exodus under the leadership of Moses. Heshbon is highlighted due to its importance as the capital of Sihon, King of the Amorites:

:&quot;For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.&quot;

Similar passages appear in Deuteronomy and Joshua, with the primary emphasis being the victory of the Israelites over King Sihon at the site of Heshbon. Moses died soon after the victory, after viewing the &quot;promised land&quot; from the top of Mount Nebo.

Following the death of Moses, Heshbon became a town at the border between the lands allocated to the Tribe of Reuben and the Tribe of Gad. Further biblical evidence suggests that the town later came under Moabite control, as mentioned by Isaiah and Jeremiah in their denunciations of Moab, and later under Ammonite occupation as Jeremiah 49:3 strongly suggests.

Heshbon also appears in the Song of Solomon, where the poet likens his love&#x27;s eyes to &quot;the pools of Heshbon&quot;, which refers to the magnificent fish-pools of Heshbon.

==Historical reference to classical towns==
===Herodian Es(e)bonitis/Sebonitis: possibly elsewhere===
The name occurs in Josephus very often under the form &quot;Esbonitis&quot; or &quot;Sebonitis&quot;. According to Josephus, Heshbon was in the possession of the Judeans since Alexander Jannaeus the Maccabee (106–79 B.C.) took it and made it a Jewish town. Herod the Great is also said to have had jurisdiction over the town and established a fort there. However, this town might not be identical with Tell Hesban: Josephus tell us that Pheroras, the younger brother of Herod the Great and tetrarch of Perea, had his residence at Esebonitis. This Esebonitis, described as a strongly fortified garrison town, has not been firmly identified and might be identical with either Machaerus, a site well researched by archaeologists and closely resembling Josephus&#x27;s description of Esebonitis, with Amathus, or with Gadora, the later placed by researchers at Tell Jadur near Salt.

===Late Roman Esebon, Esboús===
After the Great Revolt (A.D. 68–70) the country was invaded by the tribe that Pliny calls &quot;Arabes Esbonitae&quot;, meaning &quot;Arabs of (H)esebon&quot;. Restored under the name of &quot;Esboús&quot; or &quot;Esboúta&quot;, it is mentioned among the towns of the Roman Arabia Petraea by Ptolemy.

===Byzantine Hesebon===
Under the Byzantines, as learned from Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, it grew to be a town of note in the province of Arabia; George of Cyprus refers to it in the seventh century and it was from Hesebon that the milestones on the Roman road to Jericho were numbered.

The Byzantine town is mentioned in the 3rd century CE Mosaic of Rehob.

===Early Arab period===
At the beginning of the Early Arab period, Hesebon was still the chief town of the Belka, a territory corresponding to the old kingdom of Sihon. It seems never to have been taken by the Crusaders.

==History of excavation==
In 1968, archaeological excavations were undertaken at the site of &quot;Tell Hesban&quot; (alternatively spelled &quot;Tall Hisban&quot;). This excavation was the beginning of what became called the &quot;Heshbon Expedition&quot;. This archaeological work was sponsored by Andrews University and under the authority of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR). The Heshbon Expedition continued with excavation seasons through 1976. Following the cessation of Heshbon Expedition excavations, archaeological work at the site continued in 1996 under the Madaba Plains Project consortium. The site continues to be excavated into the 2010s; work is also ongoing to support archaeological tourism at the site.

==Archaeological findings==
===Not the Bronze Age Heshbon?===
The lack of evidence for occupation during the Bronze Age led excavators to conclude that the site is not Sihon&#x27;s Heshbon. William Dever&#x27;s response was &quot;The site was excavated in 1968–1976 in a large interdisciplinary project sponsored by a group of Seventh Day Adventist scholars who perhaps intended to “prove” the biblical traditions of the Israelite conquest of the site. Much to their consternation, however, the town turned out to be founded only in the Iron II period—long after any supposed conquest. There were only a few scattered remains of the 12th–11th century B.C. (pottery, but no architecture), and no trace whatsoever of occupation in the 13th century B.C. The excavators resolutely published their results, however, and reluctantly conceded that something was drastically wrong with the biblical story about Heshbon.&quot;

According to Øystein S. LaBianca and Bethany Walker, the excavations found remains from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age periods, but intensive reuse of the site by later occupants resulted in most remains from those periods being found in secondary deposits.

===Roman-period Esbus===
Classical period remains, however, confirmed its status as the Roman-period city of Esbus.

===Byzantine period===
Two churches have been discovered from the Byzantine era, and both churches produced impressive remains of mosaic floors. Particularly interesting is the (using motifs originating in the environs of the river Nile) mosaic of the presbytery of the North Church where the mosaicists have created a motif of a turtledove set on a nest made of an imaginary flower.

==Ecclesiastical history==
Hesebon is a titular see of the ecclesiastical province of Arabia, suffragan of Bostra.

Christianity took root there at an early period. Michel Le Quien (&quot;Oriens christianus&quot; II, 863–64), and Pius Bonifacius Gams (&quot;Series Episcoporum&quot;, 435) mention three bishops between the fourth and seventh centuries:

*Gennadius, present at the Council of Nicaea (Heinrich Gelzer, &quot;Patrum Nicaen. Nomina&quot;, p. lxi)
*Zosys of Esbusa signature of the Council of Ephesus in 431.
*Zosius, whose name occurs in the lists of Chalcedon
*Theodore, champion of orthodoxy against monothelism, who received (c. 649) from Pope Martin I a letter congratulating him on his resistance to the heresy and exhorting him to continue the struggle in conjunction with John of Philadelphia. To the latter the pope had entrusted the government of the patriarchates of Antioch and Jerusalem.
Konrad Eubel (&quot;Hierarchia Catholica&quot;, II, 168) mentions two Latin titulars of Hesebon in the latter part of the fifteenth century.

==Hazboun family==

The Hazboun family have long history roots from Heshbon.

<text>John Daniel LaPorta (April 13, 1920 – May 12, 2004) was a jazz clarinetist and composer.

==Early life and education==
A native of Philadelphia, LaPorta started playing clarinet at the age of nine and studied at the Mastbaum School in Philadelphia, where one of his classmates was Buddy DeFranco. As a teenager he played in Philadelphia bands with Charlie Ventura and Bill Harris. He studied classically with Joseph Gigliotti of the Philadelphia Orchestra and Leon Russianoff at the Manhattan School of Music.

== Career ==
From 1942 to 1944, he was a member of the Bob Chester big band, then spent the next two years with the Woody Herman Orchestra. Beginning in 1947, he studied with Lennie Tristano. With Teo Macero and Charles Mingus he was a member of the Jazz Composers Workshop, trying to combine jazz with classical music. In the classical world, he worked with Boston Pops, Leonard Bernstein, Leopold Stokowski, and Igor Stravinsky. In jazz he worked with Kenny Clarke, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Buddy Rich, and Lester Young.

On August 12, 1956, La Porta was invited to the first jazz concert in Venezuela at Caracas National Theater, where he was backed by the Casablanca Orchestra, Charlie Nagy, Werner Boehm, Walter Albrecht, among others. During his stay in Caracas a selection of the repertoire performed at the concert was released under the title &quot;South American Brothers&quot; by Fantasy Records, the first jazz recording in Venezuela.

He taught at Parkway Music School, then at public schools on Long Island, followed by the Manhattan School of Music and the Berklee College of Music. With guitarist Jack Petersen, he pioneered the use of Greek modes for teaching chord-scales.

== Personal life ==
In the 1990s, he and his wife retired to Sarasota, Florida, where he performed at the Sarasota Jazz Club and as a guest with the Fred Williams Trio. He wrote his autobiography, &quot;Playing It by Ear&quot;. LaPorta died from complications of a stroke on May 12, 2004, in Sarasota.

<text>Nicholas Jonathan Anselm Williams (born October 1942 in Walthamstow, Essex), sometimes credited as N. J. A. Williams, is a leading expert and poet in the Cornish language.

==Life==

While a pupil at Chigwell School, Essex, Williams taught himself Cornish and became a bard of the Cornish Gorseth while still in his teens, taking the bardic name &quot;Golvan&quot; (&#x27;Sparrow&#x27;). He read classical languages, English language and Celtic in Oxford. After short periods in the universities of Belfast (where he received his PhD) and Liverpool, he was appointed lecturer in Irish in University College Dublin in 1977. In 2006 he was appointed Associate Professor in Celtic Languages there. He married Patricia Smyth from Portadown, County Armagh in 1976.

==Work==

Williams has written widely on the Celtic languages and their literatures. His works on Irish include the editions &quot;The Poems of Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe&quot; (1980) and &quot;Pairlement Chloinne Tomáis&quot; (1981); &quot;I bPrionta i Leabhar&quot; (1986), an account of Protestant writing in Irish during the 17th century; &quot;Díolaim Luibheanna&quot; (1993) a discussion of Irish plant names and plant lore; and &quot;Armas&quot;, a handbook of Irish heraldry in Irish, which he illustrated himself. He also was joint editor of &quot;Stair na Gaeilge&quot; (‘the History of Irish&#x27;, Maynooth, 1994) for which he contributed chapters on the Irish dialects of Leinster and on Manx.

As Peter Berresford Ellis points out, Williams was the first professional Celtic scholar to study revived Cornish in depth. In 1990 Williams published an article &quot;A problem in Cornish phonology&quot;, demonstrating that the phonemes represented by the graphemes ⟨tj⟩ and ⟨dj⟩ had never been part of the language and should therefore be removed from Kernewek Kemmyn. He continued his critique of this variety of Cornish in &quot;Cornish Today&quot; (Kernewek Dre Lyther 1995) in which he also set out his own emended Unified Cornish (Unified Cornish Revised or UCR). Williams elaborated UCR in &quot;Clappya Kernowek&quot; (Agan Tavas, 1997) and in his &quot;English-Cornish Dictionary&quot; (Agan Tavas, 2000). Spyrys a Gernow published his &quot;Testament Noweth&quot;, the first complete Cornish translation of the New Testament from the original Greek in 2002. He gave the O’Donnell lectures in Oxford in May 1998, when he spoke on consecutive days on Manx and then Cornish. This was the first time that an O’Donnell lecture had ever been devoted to the Cornish language.

Articles by Williams on Cornish include: &quot;&#x27;Linguistically sound principles&#x27;: the case against Kernewek Kemmyn&quot;, &quot;Cornish Studies&quot;, 4, (1997); &quot;Pre-occlusion in Cornish&quot;, &quot;Studia Celtica&quot; 32 (1998); &quot;Indirect Statement in Cornish and Breton&quot;, &quot;Cornish Studies&quot; 6, (1998); &quot;Saint in Cornish&quot;, &quot;Cornish Studies&quot; 7 (1999) and the review, &quot;&#x27;A modern and scholarly Cornish-English dictionary&#x27;: Ken George’s &quot;Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn&quot; (1993)&quot;, &quot;Cornish Studies&quot;, 9 (2001). Williams together with Graham Thomas edited the Middle Cornish play &quot;Bewnans Ke&quot;, which had been donated to the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, in 2000. Their edition was published by Exeter University Press in association with the National Library of Wales in October 2006.

Williams was awarded first prize in the Gorsedd literary competition three times in the early 1960s. More recently he won first prize for Cornish poetry in the Cornish Gorsedd in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 1974 Berresford Ellis wrote, &quot;Probably the most able young writer in the language today is N.J.A. Williams (Golvan), a worthy successor to Edwin Chirgwin.&quot; Some of Williams&#x27;s poetry in Cornish was published by Tim Saunders in &quot;The Wheel&quot; (1990) and &quot;Nothing Broken&quot; (2006). The Welsh critic Bobi Jones says in the introduction to this anthology, &quot;Nicholas Williams, the well-known scholar, is also the T. Gwynn Jones of Cornwall – polished, classical, rather conservative, soundly rooted in medieval romanticism.&quot; Williams&#x27;s &quot;Ancow Arthur&quot;, a translation of Tennyson’s &quot;Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot;, published in &quot;Delyow Derow&quot; 15 (1996) is an example of his verse.

Nicholas Williams is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London and was awarded honorary membership of the Irish Translators&#x27; and Interpreters&#x27; Association for his Cornish New Testament. He went on to complete the first ever full translation of the Bible into Cornish in 2011. He has translated four books in the series the Letts Pocket Guides into Irish, &quot;Mammals&quot;, &quot;Insects&quot;, &quot;Medicinal Plants&quot; and &quot;Edible Plants&quot;. His translation of &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; into Irish (2003) received excellent reviews. In November 2004, he published his Irish translation of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;. In April 2012, he published his Irish translation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, and in 2014 he published a Cornish version of The Hobbit.

==Coat of arms==
Williams&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland on 1 November 2006. The escutcheon&#x27;s formal blazon is in Irish, translated here as &quot;Argent two piles throughout gules three cinquefoils counterchanged&quot; (&#x27;On white, two red triangles throughout the shield, three cinquefoils in the reverse colour&#x27;); the colours are those of the City of London, and the piles form a W. Along with this was granted a crest, &quot;On a wreath of the colours a pied wagtail bearing in its beak Ragged Robin all proper&quot; (&#x27;On a red and white wreath, a pied wagtail bearing in its beak ragged robin, all in their natural colours&#x27;). &quot;Willie wagtail&quot; is common name used for this bird in Ireland. The motto is &quot;Grásta Dé a bhfuil agamsa&quot; &quot;The Grace of God is all I have&quot;—a pun, where &quot;a bhfuil agamsa&quot; plays on &quot;Williams&quot;.

<doc id="679825" wikidata="Q209982" url="?curid=679825" title="Dražen Petrović">
<text>Dražen Petrović (; 22 October 1964 – 7 June 1993) was a Yugoslav and Croatian professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he initially achieved success playing professional basketball in Europe in the 1980s with Cibona and Real Madrid before joining the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1989.

A star on multiple international basketball stages, Petrović earned two silver medals (1988, 1992) and one bronze (1984) at the Summer Olympic Games, a gold (1990) and a bronze (1986) at the FIBA World Cup, and a gold (1989) and a bronze (1987) at the FIBA EuroBasket. He was the FIBA World Championship MVP in 1986 and the FIBA EuroBasket MVP in 1989. With Cibona Zagreb, Petrović also won two consecutive EuroLeague championships in 1985 and 1986. He first represented Yugoslavia&#x27;s senior national team and later Croatia&#x27;s senior national team. He earned four Euroscars and was named Mr. Europa twice. In 1985, he received the Golden Badge award for the best athlete of Yugoslavia.

Seeking a bigger arena after his career started in Europe, Petrović joined the NBA in 1989, as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. After playing mostly off the bench that year, Petrović experienced a breakthrough following a trade to the New Jersey Nets. While starting for the Nets, he became one of the league&#x27;s best shooting guards. He was named one of FIBA&#x27;s 50 Greatest Players in 1991. On 7 June 1993, Petrović&#x27;s career and life were cut short after he died in a car accident in Germany at the age of 28.

In 1993, Petrović&#x27;s jersey number 3 was retired by the Nets, and the Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall was named in his honor. He also received the Olympic Order in 1993. In 2002, he was posthumously enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2006, the Dražen Petrović Award was created in his honor. In 2007, he was posthumously inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame. He was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008. In 2013, he was voted the best European Basketball player in history, by players at the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket.

Petrović is considered a crucial part of the vanguard to the present-day mass influx of European players into the NBA, and to this day he is viewed as a national hero in Croatia.

==Early years==
Born in Šibenik, Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia), Dražen Petrović was the second child of Jovan &quot;Jole&quot; Petrović, a police officer, and Biserka (), a librarian. His father was born in a Serb family in Zagora, near Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina. His mother was born in Bilice, near Šibenik, and was from a traditional conservative Croat family, devoutly Catholic. The couple&#x27;s eldest child, Aleksandar, was the first to play basketball and rose to become one of the top point guards in the former Yugoslavia. The Petrović brothers are second cousins to the Serbian basketball player Dejan Bodiroga.

===Šibenka (1979–1983)===
At the age of 13, Petrović started playing in the youth selections of the local club Šibenka; at the age of 15, he had already made the club&#x27;s first team, just as Šibenka had earned a place in the Yugoslav national first division. With young Petrović as the star of the team, Šibenka reached the final of the third level Pan-European club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup twice (1981–82 and 1982–83), where they lost to the French League club Limoges CSP both times. In 1983, the 18-year-old Petrović hit two free throws in Šibenka&#x27;s victory over Bosna Sarajevo in the final playoff game of the Yugoslavian League&#x27;s 1982–83 season&#x27;s club championship. However, on the day after the club won the championship, the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia stripped the title from Šibenka, because of irregularities in refereeing. The league&#x27;s championship was then awarded to Bosna, after Šibenka refused to play in a rematch.

Petrović increased his scoring numbers in each successive season that he played with Šibenka. In the 1979–80 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 13 points in 16 games, for an average of 0.8 points per game. In the 1980–81 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 39 points in 20 games, for an average of 2.0 points per game. In the 1981–82 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 392 points in 24 games, for an average of 16.3 points per game. In the 1982–83 Yugoslav FFL season, he scored 758 points in 31 games, for an average of 24.5 points per game. In total, he scored 1,202 points in 91 games played with Šibenka in the Yugoslav first division, for a scoring average of 13.2 points per game.

==Rise to European stardom==

===Cibona Zagreb (1984–1988)===
====1984–85 season====
After a year&#x27;s mandatory service in the Yugoslav military, Petrović joined his older brother Aco and moved to Cibona Zagreb, to form what was at that time, the best back court duo in Europe. In his first season in Cibona, Petrović won both the national Yugoslav League championship and the Yugoslav National Cup title. In national domestic league play, in the 1984–85 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović averaged 32.5 points per game.

On 6 December 1984, in the 1984–85 season of Europe&#x27;s top-level club competition, the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored 44 points in a game against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. He scored 29 of the 44 points in the second half of the game. Petrović also scored 36 points in the league&#x27;s 1985 Final against Real Madrid. Cibona won the game, by a score of 87–78, and the win brought the club their first top-tier level European Champions Cup title. That season, Petrović scored a total of 463 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 30.9 points per game.

====1985–86 season====
On 5 October 1985, in a Yugoslav First Federal League game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana, Petrović scored 112 points, in Cibona&#x27;s 158–77 blowout win. He scored 67 of the 112 points in the first half of the game. During the game, Petrović shot 40/60 from the field, 10/20 from 3-point range, and 22/22 from the free-throw line. The 112 points scored was the most points ever scored in a single game in the history of the Yugoslav First Federal League. It broke the league&#x27;s previous single-game scoring record of 74 points, which was set in 1962, by Radivoj Korać. Korać achieved that record while playing with OKK Beograd, in a game against Mladost Zagreb.

Olimpija Ljubljana had failed to fulfill their player registration administrative obligations in time for the game. Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek was reportedly late with submitting a registration letter to the Basketball Federation of Yugoslavia (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade. That rendered their entire men&#x27;s first team roster ineligible for the Yugoslav First Federal League&#x27;s regular season opening game, and forced them to instead field players for the game from their youth systems. Olimpija didn&#x27;t have an under-18 youth squad that season so the club went to Zagreb to play the game with younger players. in the under-16 and under-17 age groups, which included: Igor Đurović, Matjaž Strmole, Jože Maček, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorčič, Gregor Stražiščar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj.

Cibona, for their part, decided to use a mixed roster for the game, consisting of players from their youth system, plus their senior men&#x27;s team&#x27;s twenty-one-year-old Dražen Petrović, who broke Korać&#x27;s single-game Yugoslav League scoring record of 74 points. Petrović scored 112 points in the game; before the game, he had reportedly announced his intention to leave the game once he had surpassed Korać&#x27;s 74 points record. Petrović was one of only five Cibona players to score that day.

From November 1985, Petrović began partnering in the backcourt with another high-scoring player, newly arrived shooting guard Danko Cvjetićanin, brought in as replacement for Aco Petrović who was away serving his mandatory Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) stint.

Overall, over the 1985–86 Yugoslav League regular season and playoffs, Petrović scored a total of 1,241 points in 30 games played, for a scoring average of 41.4 points per game. That season, Petrović also won another Yugoslav National Cup title with Cibona. On 7 February 1986, Petrović scored 55 points in a Yugoslav Cup game against Union Olimpija Ljubljana. He also scored 46 points in the 1986 Yugoslav Cup&#x27;s Final against Cibona&#x27;s old rivals Bosna Sarajevo.

On 4 December 1985, in a 1985–86 season FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) game against the Israeli Super League club Maccabi Tel Aviv, Petrović scored 44 points. In the same European Champions Cup season, on 11 December 1985, he had 47 points and 25 assists in a game against the then reigning Italian League champions Simac Milano. In another European Champions Cup game that season, on 16 January 1986, Petrović scored 49 points, and had 20 assists against the Spanish League club Real Madrid. On 22 January 1986, in a European Champions Cup game against the French League club Limoges, Petrović made ten 3-pointers, including seven in a row during a first-half stretch, for a final tally of 51 points and 10 assists in the game. The 51 points scored was also his personal career-high scored in a single EuroLeague game.

Petrović won his second straight FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) title with Cibona, as he scored 22 points in the league&#x27;s 1986 Final, in which Cibona defeated the USSR Premier League club Žalgiris Kaunas, which starred Arvydas Sabonis. In the 1985–86 European Champions Cup (EuroLeague) season, Petrović scored a total of 555 points in 15 games played, for a scoring average of 37.0 points per game.

The season ended with Cibona losing the Yugoslav league playoff final series to KK Zadar. Following an opening game win, Petrović controversially sat out game 2 away in Zadar, ostensibly due to a pre-game warm-up injury, leading to accusations of tanking out of desire to win the title on home court in front of their own fans. Cibona lost game 2 thus setting up the deciding game 3 at home in Zagreb at the sold out Dom sportova. However, in one of the biggest upsets in Yugoslav League history, despite having a double-digit lead in the second half, Cibona ended up losing game 3 in double overtime with Petrović fouling out during first overtime with 39 points scored.

====1986–87 season====
In the 1986–87 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 932 points in 25 games played, for a scoring average of 37.3 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in the European-wide secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup competition. Petrović led Cibona to the championship, as he scored 28 points against the Italian League club Scavolini Pesaro, in the league&#x27;s 1986–87 season Final. It was the third straight European-wide club championship for Petrović and Cibona.

In the 1986–87 FIBA European Cup Winners Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 270 points in 8 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game.

====1987–88 season====
With Cibona, Petrović again won the Yugoslav National Cup title in 1988. In the 1987–88 Yugoslav FFL season, Petrović scored a total of 860 points in 24 games played, for a scoring average of 35.8 points per game. In that same season, Cibona competed in Europe&#x27;s third-level club competition, the FIBA Korać Cup. On 14 October 1987, Petrović scored 62 points in a 1987–88 FIBA Korać Cup season game against the Finnish League club KTP Kotka. Petrović led Cibona to the Finals of the Korać Cup, where they lost to the Spanish League club Real Madrid. During the Korać Cup season, Petrović scored a total of 401 points in 12 games played, for a scoring average of 33.4 points per game.

During his four seasons with Cibona, Petrović scored a total of 3,911 points, in 106 games played in the national Yugoslav First Federal League, for a scoring average of 36.9 points per game. With Cibona, he also scored a total of 559 points, in 20 games played, for a scoring average of 28.0 points per game, in the Yugoslav Cup competition. In the three Pan-European club competitions that he played in with Cibona, he scored a total of 1,689 points in 50 games played, for a scoring average of 33.8 points per game.

With both Šibenka and Cibona, Petrović&#x27;s career scoring numbers in the Yugoslav First Federal League were 5,113 points scored, in 197 games played, for a career scoring average of 26.0 points per game. In the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague), Petrović scored a career total of 1,018 points in 30 games played, for a career scoring average of 33.9 points per game.

===Real Madrid (1988–1989)===
After his string of very successful seasons with Cibona Zagreb, Petrović needed new challenges that Cibona and the Yugoslav First Federal League could no longer offer him. The NBA&#x27;s Portland Trail Blazers had already used their third-round draft pick on the young Petrović, in the 1986 NBA draft, but he had decided to postpone his departure to the United States. In 1988, rather than go to the NBA, he instead signed with the Spanish League club Real Madrid, for around US$4 million in net income.

At that time, Yugoslav sporting laws stipulated that players could not professionally move abroad until they had reached the age of 28. Petrović was still only 23 when he signed with Real Madrid. In 2014, José Antonio Arízaga, the sports agent who played a key role in Petrović&#x27;s 1988 summer transfer from Cibona to Real, recalled a few details from the transaction: &quot;I spoke to Mirko Novosel, Dražen&#x27;s head coach at Cibona, and he told me two things. One, every problem in Yugoslavia can be taken care of with the right amount of money, and two, if Dražen leaves, every other player under 28 will be leaving and it&#x27;ll be chaos. So, you can imagine all the individuals I had to bribe and all the places where I had to pay up, in order to circumvent this law&quot;.

====1988–89 season====
Petrović helped Real to win the title of the 1989 edition of the Spanish King&#x27;s Cup, over their Catalan rivals, Barcelona. In the Spanish ACB League&#x27;s Finals, Real Madrid narrowly lost to Barcelona, in the fifth and decisive game of the series. In the Spanish League&#x27;s 1988–89 ACB season, Petrović was the league&#x27;s regular season top scorer. Including the playoffs, he scored a total of 1,327 points, in 47 games played, for a scoring average of 28.2 points per game. Petrović&#x27;s first season in Spain&#x27;s ACB was also his last, but he still holds the ACB&#x27;s single-game Finals records for the most points scored, with 42, and for the most three-pointers made, with 8.

In European-wide club competition, Real Madrid competed in the European secondary level FIBA European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. On 14 March 1989, in the 1988–89 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup Final against the Italian League club Snaidero Caserta, Petrović tied his previous best scoring performance in a European-wide club competition with 62 points.

Petrović was pressured to join the NBA, by the Trail Blazers, who had drafted him 60th overall in 1986. Being motivated by the potential new challenges that the NBA presented, Petrović finally decided to try to establish himself in the league. He left Spain rather abruptly, at the end of the season; the Blazers assisted him in the process, by buying out his contract with Real Madrid, for as much as US$1.5 million. Petrović finally joined the Blazers for the 1989–90 season.

==NBA career==

===Portland Trail Blazers (1989–1991)===

The Blazers valued Petrović as a shooter, but were concerned that he might not possess the quickness to play guard or the foot speed to play defense. They brought him onto the team primarily as an outside threat to shoot three-pointers. In the Blazers&#x27; offensive scheme he was to set up behind the line, receive a passed ball and go directly up to release his shot. Petrović was an aggressive, attacking player who was used to creating his shot and shots for his teammates. Taking the ball out of his hands and making him a static shooter was foreign to him. Making matters worse, the Blazers already had a full rotation of guards, with a starting backcourt of Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter, and with veteran Danny Young as a reserve. Consequently, the reigning La Gazzetta dello Sport Euroscar European Player of the Year saw limited playing time. He had difficulty being productive in the limited role the Blazers had for him. In his rookie year during the 1989–90 NBA season, he averaged 7.4 points in 12 minutes per game.

The following season, veteran guard Danny Ainge was added to the team, and Petrović&#x27;s playing time dropped further to 7 minutes a game. In many statements made prior to arriving in Portland, Petrović had said he saw a lack of playing time as the only possible obstacle to his success in the NBA. He was determined to be a success in basketball&#x27;s highest arena. His lack of playing time during his second season in the league brought Petrović&#x27;s frustration to a climax: &quot;I have nothing to say to Adelman any more and vice versa. Eighteen months have passed by, too long. I have to leave to prove how much I am worth. Never in my life did I sit on the bench and I don&#x27;t intend to do that in Portland.&quot;

At his insistence, 38 games into the season (20 of which held no playing time for Petrović), a three-way trade with the Denver Nuggets sent him to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for a first-round pick in the following draft and Walter Davis, who was sent from Denver to Portland.

===New Jersey Nets (1991–1993)===

On 23 January 1991, Petrović became a member of the New Jersey Nets. He joined a team that had not reached the playoffs since 1986, but had rookie Derrick Coleman, the number one selection from the 1990 draft. He was immediately given a role on the floor, with 20.5 minutes per game. His scoring over the remaining 43 games increased to 12.6 points per game, one of the league&#x27;s best points-per-minute ratios. The following year, he and Coleman were joined by Kenny Anderson, giving the team a third talented new addition, and forming was expected to grow into a &quot;big three&quot;. Petrović was made a starter for the 1991–92 season, his first full season with the Nets. &quot;Petro&quot;, as the Americans had dubbed him, did not miss a single game. On 13 March 1992, Petrović scored 39 points while shooting 65% from the field, and 100% (3 of 3) from 3 point range, in a 110–108 win against the Boston Celtics. His determination, hard work and aggressive on-court demeanor established him as a team leader. In 36.9 minutes on the floor he averaged 20.6 points. Petrović led the Nets in field-goal shooting and free-throw shooting, and his field goal percentage of 51% placed him near the top of all NBA guards. More importantly, his success translated into success for the team. The Nets made the playoffs, recording 14 more wins than the previous year. On 23 April 1992, in Game 1 of their first round matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Petrović scored a playoff career-high 40 points. The Nets would eventually lose the best of 5 series 3 games to 1. The following season saw Petrović increase his scoring average to 22.3 ppg, 11th best in the league.
On 6 December 1992, he was named MVP of the Week. On 4 February 1993, Petrović played a career-high 53 minutes and scored 35 points in an overtime win against the Seattle SuperSonics. For the second season in a row he shot 45% from the three-point arc. His field goal percentage of 52% was again near the top for all guards. American media honored him with a selection to the All-NBA Third Team. However, he did not receive an invitation to the 1993 All-Star game.

==National team career==

===Yugoslavia===

Petrović&#x27;s national team debut came at the age of 15, at the Under-18 Balkan Championship in Turkey, where the Yugoslavia junior team won the bronze. The young man regularly played for the Yugoslavia national team in the Balkan Championships, also winning gold with the junior team and silver with the senior team. He also brought back the silver from the 1982 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship in Bulgaria.
The 1984 Summer Olympics were Petrović&#x27;s first competition of a grand scale with the Yugoslavia senior national team, and the bronze medal won in Los Angeles that summer became his first Olympic medal. Third place was also earned at the 1986 FIBA World Championship, remembered for the last minute thriller in the semi-final game against the Soviet Union. Petrović was named the MVP of the tournament. At the 1987 EuroBasket, Petrović again returned with bronze, as Yugoslavia lost to the hosts and gold medalists Greece. The University Games, held in Zagreb in 1987, saw the Yugoslavian squad with Petrović win the gold. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, Yugoslavia with Petrović, earned 2nd place, as they lost once more to the Soviet powerhouse.

An excellent club season with Real Madrid was topped by Petrović&#x27;s 1989 accomplishment with the Yugoslavia national team: at the EuroBasket in Zagreb, the young Yugoslavian team went all the way, defeating Greece more than comfortably in the championship game. Petrović was the tournament&#x27;s second leading scorer and Most Valuable Player. The very next year, the summer in between the two most frustrating seasons of his professional career, as he struggled for playing time with the Trail Blazers, Petrović was again making history with the national team, as Yugoslavia became world champions, after beating the Soviet Union for the gold in Buenos Aires, at the 1990 FIBA World Championship.

Overall, Petrović represented Yugoslavia&#x27;s senior national team in 155 games, in which he scored a total of 3,258 points, for a career scoring average of 21.0 points per game.

===Croatia===

The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, marked the first summer Olympics featuring the independent Croatia, and Petrović was the leader of the Croatian national basketball team at the Olympic basketball tournament. Losing only to the American Dream Team in the group stage, a strong and inspired Croatian team emerged victorious from the Semifinals against the revamped Soviet team, thanks to clutch free throws executed by Petrović, and faced off against the Americans for the gold. Urged on by Petrović&#x27;s competitiveness and confidence, the Croatians fared well in the first ten minutes of the game, taking a 25–23 lead on a Franjo Arapović dunk and the subsequent made free throw. As the game progressed, however, the now-legendary team composed of NBA stars proved too tough for Croatia: the Americans won 117–85, sending Petrović, the game&#x27;s leading scorer with 24 points, and his teammates, home with silver medals.

In the period during which Petrović played for the senior Croatian national team (1992–1993), he appeared in 40 games and scored a total of 1,002 points, for a career scoring average of 25.1 points per game. His highest single-game point tally came against Estonia, on 31 May 1993 (48 points). Counting the senior national team games that he played in with both Yugoslavia&#x27;s and Croatia&#x27;s national teams, Petrović scored a total of 4,260 points in 195 games played, for a career scoring average of 21.8 points per game.

==Death and legacy==
In the summer of 1993, after his best NBA season and the Nets&#x27; first-round elimination by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Petrović traveled to Wrocław, where the Croatian national team was playing a qualification tournament for the 1993 EuroBasket. He was contemplating departure from the Nets, disappointed with the fact that the Nets had not yet extended his contract. He told American reporters that the lack of recognition in the league made him also consider leaving the NBA completely and playing club basketball in Greece. There were at least two Greek clubs ready to offer Petrović three-year contracts worth US$7.5 million net. Petrović decided to skip the connection flight back to Zagreb from Frankfurt and instead drive to Zagreb with a woman he was romantically involved with at the time. He had met her only a few weeks prior after a game at the Meadowlands Arena.
Petrović died in a traffic accident at about 5:20 p.m. on 7 June 1993. On the rain-drenched Autobahn 9, he was a passenger in a car that was cut off by a semi-truck at Denkendorf near Ingolstadt in the German state of Bavaria. According to the report of the Ingolstadt police, that afternoon a truck broke through the Autobahn median; the driver was trying to avoid a collision with a personal vehicle in his own lane and lost control of the truck, crashing through the median barrier and finally coming to a stop and blocking all three lanes of traffic going in the opposite direction. Seconds later, the Volkswagen Golf carrying a sleeping Petrović in the passenger seat crashed into the truck, and Petrović was ejected from the vehicle. 

According to the autopsy report, Petrović died of severe head injuries on impact. The driver, Klara Szalantzy, a Hungarian model and basketball player with whom Petrović was romantically involved, and , a female Turkish basketball player, sustained serious injuries. It was established that visibility on the road was very poor and neither Petrović nor Edebal wore their seatbelts. According to Edebal, who incurred severe memory loss as a result of the accident and would never play basketball again, Szalantzy was driving , which was legal on the Autobahn. Szalantzy would return to modeling and basketball not long after. 

Petrović was buried on June 12, 1993, with a Catholic funeral Mass celebrated by Auxiliary Bishop Marko Culej of Zagreb. Petrović&#x27;s tomb at Mirogoj Cemetery instantly became a sanctuary for his compatriots. The Cibona stadium was renamed the Dražen Petrović Basketball Hall on 4 October 1993, and the city of Zagreb dedicated a square in his name, which was later followed by Šibenik and Vukovar, while Petrinja dedicated a street to him. Before Game 1 of the 1993 NBA Finals, the NBA held a moment of silence for Petrović, whose death occurred two days before the event began. The Nets retired his number 3 jersey on 11 November 1993. On June 4, 1994, Diego Maradona, the Argentine football star who also had Croatian roots, paid tribute to Dražen Petrović by placing his Argentina jersey on the basketball star&#x27;s grave in Zagreb. After 1994, the MVP award at the McDonald&#x27;s Championship bore the name Dražen Petrović Trophy, and the Croatian Olympic Committee&#x27;s award for young athletes was named for him in 2006. On 29 April 1995, a statue commemorating Petrović&#x27;s significance to the world of sports was erected in front of the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, thus making him only the second athlete to receive this honor. On 9 July 2001, having defeated Patrick Rafter to win the men&#x27;s singles title at Wimbledon, Croatian tennis player Goran Ivanišević dedicated the win to Petrović; Ivanišević wore Petrović&#x27;s Nets jersey amidst the 100,000 strong crowd celebrating his victory in Split. Petrović was inducted posthumously into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2006, the 13th anniversary of Petrović&#x27;s death was marked with the opening of the Dražen Petrović Memorial Center in Zagreb, dedicated to his life and achievements, with ten themed galleries of multimedia content outlining his entire career and a statue of Dražen in shooting position in front of it. Petrović was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007.

The 2010 documentary, &quot;Once Brothers&quot; (part of the ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; series), portrays the achievements of the Yugoslavia national basketball team in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and how the Yugoslav Wars tore the team apart. It explores Petrović&#x27;s broken friendship with Serbian/Yugoslav player Vlade Divac. In 2011, a statue of him as a little boy sitting on a bench with a ball was unveiled in Šibenik, and his old room was renovated the way it looked when he was young, as a first part of opening a Memorial Center in his hometown. During the 2012 Three Point Shootout, New Jersey Nets guard Anthony Morrow wore Petrović&#x27;s jersey in the latter&#x27;s honor. In 2015, Australian writer Todd Spehr released a 470-page biography on Petrović, titled &quot;Dražen: The Remarkable Life &amp; Legacy of the Mozart of Basketball&quot;. At the urging of the Petrovic family, Spehr&#x27;s book was released in the Croatian language in 2016 at the Petrovic Museum, and is considered the definitive work on his life. On 3 June 2015, Croatian basketball journalists Marjan Crnogaj and Vlado Radicevic released a 487-page biography, the global paperback edition of which was released on 14 October 2017.

==Dražen Petrović Memorial Center==
A museum named &quot;The Dražen Petrović Memorial Center&quot; was founded in his honor, and constitutes a co-operative effort led by the Dražen Petrović Foundation in conjunction with the Croatian government, the city of Zagreb and the Croatian Museum of Sports. The memorial center idea originated from Petrović&#x27;s parents, Biserka and Jole Petrovic, and was supported with the contributions of Croatian architects Andrija Rusan and Niksa Bilic. All of the articles presented in the center have been collected and categorized by the Croatian Museum of Sports. The organization and operations of the center have been provided by the Dražen Petrović Foundation, which is led by Petrović&#x27;s family. The Center contains his No. 3 New Jersey Nets jersey and the watch that stopped when he died in a car crash. The center features 1,000 memorabilia items and a video of his basketball highlights.

The official opening of the museum was held on 7 June 2006, while the official opening of the center to the public began at the end of December 2006. The square on which the center is operated upon has been renamed to &quot;Dražen Petrović Square&quot; in his honor. In 2013, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose visited the museum.

<text>A toboggan is a simple sled traditionally used by children. It is also a traditional form of transport used by the Innu and Cree of northern Canada.

In modern times, it is used on snow to carry one or more people (often children) down a hill or other slope for recreation. Designs vary from simple, traditional models to modern engineered composites. A toboggan differs from most sleds or sleighs in that it has no runners or skis (or only low ones) on the underside. The bottom of a toboggan rides directly on the snow. Some parks include designated toboggan hills where ordinary sleds are not allowed and which may include toboggan runs similar to bobsleigh courses.

Toboggans can vary depending on the climate and geographical region. Such examples are Tangalooma (Australia) where toboggans are made from Masonite boards and used for travelling down steep sand dunes at speeds up to .

== Etymology ==
The term toboggan likely comes from an Algonquin language, though the exact one is not sure. It likely comes from the Mi%27kmaq word &quot;tepaqan&quot;, meaning sled, or the Abenaki word &quot;dabôgan&quot;, meaning sled.

== Design and use ==

Toboggan was originally an Algonquian term for a type of man-hauled cargo sledge made from bark, hardwood or whalebone, and deer or buffalo hide. Sledges of this type have been in use on the Great Plains and the Great Lakes since 3000 BCE. During the tribes&#x27; yearly migration to their winter campsites, these sledges were used to transport bulky personal possessions and small children before the introduction of the wheel. A smaller variant of the toboggan, used for recreational purposes, was known as a Tom Pung. As Europeans settled traditional Algonquian lands, the term was absorbed as an English loanword and applied to the low-profile wooden sledges made by the colonists.
The precursor to the modern American toboggan was the small, utilitarian sledge used by woodcutters in Russia, Scandinavia, and especially Germany, to transport logs when the snow made roads inaccessible. Sledge races were a popular winter sport in mountainous countries during the pre-Industrial Revolution era, and early German colonists in America improved upon the design of the traditional toboggan by giving it a lower, more streamlined profile to increase its speed.

The traditional American toboggan is made of bound, parallel wood slats, all bent up and backwards at the front to form a recumbent &#x27;J&#x27; shape. A thin rope is run across the edge of end of the curved front to provide rudimentary steering. These usually lack the iron runners of the older woodcutter&#x27;s sledges. The frontmost rider places their feet in the curved front space and sits on the flat bed; any others sit behind them and grasp the waist of the person before them.
Toboggans come in a variety of shapes. Modern recreational toboggans are typically manufactured from wood or plastic or aluminum. A small plastic sled on which a rider sits and raises their legs while sledding may be known as a &quot;bum slider&quot;. Larger, more rugged models are made for commercial or rescue use.

<text>Pendine (, &quot;end of the dunes&quot;) is a village and community in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Situated on the northern shore of Carmarthen Bay and bordered by the communities of Eglwyscummin and Llanddowror, the population at the 2011 census was 346.

There are two parts of the village: the old hill-top settlement around the parish church; and the small harbour settlement on the shore. The latter developed into a small seaside resort during the 20th century. The seaside resort is best known for adjacent Pendine Sands.

==Development==
In 2016 Carmarthenshire County Council completed construction of a new building on the Pendine promenade. It was named the Parry Thomas Centre and contains five commercial premises and public toilets.

In 2019 construction began on the next stage of the Pendine Tourism Attractor Project, creating an eco activity resort, including a hostel with Passivhaus certification. The Museum of Speed was demolished in 2019 and will be replaced in the new development by the Sands of Speed Museum.

==Demographics==
Pendine community&#x27;s population was 346, according to the 2011 census; a 1.4% decrease since the 351 people noted in 2001. The community, which covers an area of , lies a few miles south of the linguistic boundary known as the Landsker line, and is predominantly English-speaking. The 2011 census showed 18.2% of the population could speak Welsh, a rise from 13.9% in 2001.

==The beach==
Malcolm Campbell and J. G. Parry-Thomas set the world land speed record five times between 1924 and 1927. Parry-Thomas was killed while making a final record-breaking attempt on Pendine Sands in 1927. For part of the summer the Pendine Museum of Speed has, Parry-Thomas&#x27; restored car &quot;Babs&quot; on display. Carmarthenshire Land Sailing Club is allowed to use the beach for wind-traction activities, including land sailing, kite buggying and kite landboarding.

Cars were banned from the beach between 2005 and 2010 but are now permitted. The BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top Gear&quot; have thrice test-driven on the sands.

==MOD Pendine==
MOD Pendine is a military range operated by the defence technology company QinetiQ for weapons testing, evaluation and training. The range occupies with of shoreline and a sea danger area of . The range includes three test tracks.

Part of the beach is classified as a land danger area and is sometimes cordoned off when the range is active.

<text>Adam L. Penenberg (born July 27, 1962) is an American journalist and educator, currently associate professor of journalism at New York University and director of undergraduate studies. He had previously served as editor of PandoDaily and written for &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Fast Company&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Wired News&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot;. While at &quot;Forbes&quot;, Penenberg gained national attention in 1998 for helping reveal &quot;The New Republic&quot; reporter Stephen Glass had been fabricating his stories.

==Education==
Penenberg received his B.A. in Economics from Reed College.

==Career==

===Stephen Glass scandal===
In the summer of 1998, Penenberg, then a reporter with &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s online arm, Forbes Digital Tool, came upon a story in &quot;The New Republic&quot; about a Silicon Valley firm which was hacked by a teenager, then hired the hacker as a security consultant. Amazed that &quot;The New Republic&quot; had somehow managed to scoop &quot;Forbes&quot;, Penenberg tried to verify it. Penenberg could not find any evidence that the company, Jukt Micronics, even existed. He also could not verify any of the events that Glass claimed resulted from the hacker&#x27;s hiring, such as a radio spot from concerned Nevada state officials or several joint state efforts to combat hacking. After an internal investigation, &quot;The New Republic&quot; determined that Glass had fabricated the story and subsequently fired him.

===Other activities===
, Penenberg is an assistant professor of journalism at New York University. He is also a freelance writer for &quot;Fast Company&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Wired News&quot;, and &quot;Playboy&quot;.

<doc id="679837" wikidata="Q2341939" url="?curid=679837" title="Basketball court">
<text>In basketball, the basketball court is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor, with baskets at each end. Indoor basketball courts are almost always made of polished wood, usually maple, with -high rims on each basket. Outdoor surfaces are generally made from standard paving materials such as concrete or asphalt. International competitions may use glass basketball courts.

== Dimensions ==
Basketball courts come in many different sizes. In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the court is . Under International Basketball Federation (FIBA) rules, the court is slightly smaller, measuring . In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. Many older high school gyms were or even in length. The baskets are always above the floor (except possibly in youth competition).

Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player&#x27;s foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the plane of the backboard. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.

===Table===


==Sections==
===Center circle===
The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

===Three-point line===
The three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the three-point area; any shot made beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three free throws if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.

The distance to the three-point line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:

* 19.75 ft (6.02 m): High schools (US)
* 21.65 ft (6.60 m) to 22.15 ft (6.75 m): FIBA and NCAA
* 22 ft (6.71 m) to 22.15 ft (6.75 m): WNBA
* 22 ft (6.71 m) to 23.75 ft (7.24 m): NBA

The NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the 1979–80 season. This is of variable distance, ranging from in the corners to behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1986.

In most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for college basketball as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–12 season. During the 2019 offseason, the NCAA men&#x27;s playing rules committee adopted the FIBA arc in a two-phase implementation, with Division I adopting the new arc in 2019–20 and other NCAA divisions doing so in 2020–21. The NCAA women&#x27;s arc was moved to the FIBA arc starting in 2021–22.

The international distance, used in most countries outside the United States, as well as in FIBA and NCAA competition, is currently 6.6 m (21.65 ft) to 6.75 m (22.15 ft). The WNBA uses FIBA&#x27;s arc except in the corner area, where the minimum distance is the NBA standard of 22 ft (6.71 m).

===Perimeter===
The perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called &quot;perimeter shots&quot; or &quot;outside shots&quot; as called during older NBA games.
If a player&#x27;s foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.

===Low post area===
The low post is defined as the areas closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane. This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a jump shot.

=== Key ===
The key, free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA, it is 16.02 feet (wider for FIBA tournaments). Since October 2010, the FIBA-spec key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously, it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12 ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25 inches) at the end line; the NBA and U.S. college basketball has always used a rectangle key.

The key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents&#x27; team for long periods (maximum three seconds).

The no charge zone arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.
The no charge zone arc in almost all North American rule sets above high school level (NCAA men&#x27;s, NBA, and WNBA) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. FIBA uses a marginally larger radius of 1.25 m (4 ft 1.2 in). Starting with the 2023–24 season, NCAA women&#x27;s basketball reduced the size of the no-charge arc to a radius of 9 inches (22.86 cm)—in other words, the size of the basket. The no charge zone arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997–98 season. The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s seasons at a radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the 4-foot radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond. NCAA men&#x27;s basketball still uses the 4-foot radius.

===Baseline===
The baseline or endline is the boundary line running the end of the court, and usually measures 50 feet long. Inbounds passes after made baskets are taken from the baseline.

===Other lines===
On NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.

Also, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.

On the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.

===FIBA changes===

On April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year&#x27;s World Championships for men and women, and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.
* The shape of the key changed from a trapezoid to a rectangle as it is in the NBA, with NBA dimensions.
* The three-point line moved back to 6.75 meters (22 ft 1.7 in) from 6.25 meters (20 ft 6.1 in), compared to for the NBA at the top of the arc.
* The FIBA adopted the NBA&#x27;s restricted area arc with a marginally wider radius of 1.25 meters (4 ft 1.2 in).
