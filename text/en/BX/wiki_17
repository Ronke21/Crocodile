<text>In typography and word processing, a page header (or simply header) is text that is separated from the body text and appears at the top of a printed page. Word-processing programs usually allow for the configuration of page headers, which are typically identical throughout a work except in aspects such as page numbers. 

The counterpart at the bottom of the page is called a page footer (or simply footer); its content is typically similar and often complementary to that of the page header.

In publishing and certain types of academic writing, a running head, less often called a running header, running headline or running title, is a header that appears on each standard page. Running heads do not usually appear on display pages such as title pages, or on other front or back matter. Running heads in a book typically consist of the title on the left-hand (verso) page, and the chapter title on the right-hand (recto) page; or the chapter title on the verso and subsection title/subhead on the recto, aiding the reader&#x27;s navigation by showing what content exists within the two-page spread at hand. 

A special case of the latter is in dictionaries, whose running heads are called guide words; they show the first headword and last headword on each page, to expedite the reader&#x27;s navigation to a desired headword. In academic writing, the running head usually contains the page number along with the author&#x27;s last name, or an abbreviated version of the title. The counterpart of the running head is the running foot.

<text>Shaw–Howard University station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green Line. The station primarily serves Washington&#x27;s Shaw neighborhood, the home of Howard University.

The station is located within the neighborhood of the same name in the Northwest quadrant of the city, on 7th Street between R and S Streets. It lies just outside the defined boundaries of the Shaw Historic District, which encompasses much the area to the southwest.

==Transit-oriented development==
Like other stations along the stretch of the Green Line between and , Shaw has been revitalized by transit-oriented development, increasing economic development, residential density, and—controversially—accelerating the pace of gentrification.

Among other projects, Progression Place and CityMarket at O catalyzed development in the area in the early 2010s. The former occupies previously vacant land on the same block as the northern entrance to the station. It contains of office space (with the UNCF being the anchor tenant), 205 apartments labeled as &quot;7th Flats,&quot; and of retail.

CityMarket at O, located between 7th, 9th, O, and P Streets NW, renovated the long-neglected O Street Market and added of retail and 629 residential units.

==History==
Part of the original Metro plan, the station was initially referred to simply as &quot;Shaw&quot;. It opened on May 11, 1991, as part of a northward extension of the Green Line from Gallery Place–Chinatown to U Street. The central route under 7th Street, below which the station sits, was added in 1967 primarily to serve the &quot;inner city.&quot; The downtown segment of the line was initially projected to open in September 1977, but the first Green Line stations did not open until 1991. While a cut-and-fill tunnel for the Green Line was built under 7th Street and U Street, maintaining vehicle traffic and pedestrian access on those streets was difficult. The result was the loss of the traditional retail businesses along the route.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

==Station layout==
Like most underground Metro stations, Shaw–Howard University is an island-platformed station lying directly below street level. There are two entrances, one to the north at the corner of 7th and S Streets and the other to the south on R Street between 7th and 8th Streets. The station features the 22-coffer &quot;waffle&quot; ceiling vault design among , , , , and .

<doc id="664264" wikidata="Q1907505" url="?curid=664264" title="Revival meeting">
<text>A revival meeting is a series of Christian religious services held to inspire active members of a church body to gain new converts and to call sinners to repent. Those who lead revival services are known as revivalists (or evangelists). Nineteenth-century Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon said, &quot;Many blessings may come to the unconverted in consequence of a revival among Christians, but the revival itself has to do only with those who already possess spiritual life.&quot; These meetings are usually conducted by churches or missionary organizations throughout the world. Notable historic revival meetings were conducted in the United States by evangelist Billy Sunday and in Wales by evangelist Evan Roberts. Revival services occur in local churches, brush arbor revivals, tent revivals, and camp meetings.

== Meetings ==

A revival meeting usually consists of several consecutive nights of services conducted at the same time and location, most often the building belonging to the sponsoring congregation but sometimes a rented assembly hall, for more adequate space, to provide a setting that is more comfortable for non-Christians, or to reach a community where there are no churches. Tents were very frequently employed in this effort in the recent past, and occasionally still are, but less so due to the difficulties in heating and cooling them and otherwise making them comfortable, an increasing consideration with modern audiences.

Ben M. Bogard, from 1909 to 1914, conducted revivals full-time in seven southern states. In 1924, he founded the American Baptist Association, the Missionary Baptist denomination, still based in Texarkana, Texas. ABA churches have traditionally held revivals usually once or twice a year.

The length of such meetings varies. Until the last quarter-century they were frequently a week or more in duration, especially in the Southern United States. Currently they may be held for three or four days. Evangelist Billy Graham planned a week-long crusade in New York City, which ultimately extended from May 15 to September 1, 1957. More than two million people went to New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden to hear him preach.

Most groups holding revival meetings tend to be of a conservative or fundamentalist nature, although some are still held by Mainline groups, which formerly conducted them with a far greater frequency. Similar events may be referred to as &quot;crusades&quot;, most especially those formerly held by Billy Graham and Oral Roberts.

Along with camp meetings, the holding of revival services is an integral part of the Methodist tradition, in which they serve to offer individuals the New Birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace), along with calling backsliders to repentance. Revival services are often held for a week at least once a year in Methodist churches.

Conservative Mennonites continue to hold and promote protracted revival meetings of usually seven or eight days duration at least once per year in a given congregation. The visiting evangelist is chosen from among their own or related congregations.

Many revivals are conducted by nondenominational community churches, most of which are conservative in theology.

==In popular culture==
This movement has been portrayed by director Richard Brooks in his 1960 film &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; with Burt Lancaster (who received the Academy Award for this film) and Jean Simmons, adapted from Sinclair Lewis&#x27; eponymous novel.

The Stephen King novel, &quot;Revival&quot;, features a major character who is a revival meeting faith healer.

There is a revival scene in the 1997 film &quot;The Apostle&quot;, starring Robert Duvall. Duvall&#x27;s portrayal of an evangelical minister earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination.

Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; begins with a scene set at a revival meeting.

The Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Marjoe&quot; reviews the career of child-evangelist Marjoe Gortner, giving a behind-the-scenes look at revivals he promoted as an adult.

Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Brother Love&#x27;s Traveling Salvation Show&quot; depicts a revival meeting.

The music video for OneRepublic&#x27;s &quot;Counting Stars&quot; depicts a Christian revival meeting.

Laura Ingalls Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Little Town on the Prairie&quot; depicts a week of revival meetings at the Congregational church in De Smet, South Dakota.

Remembrances of revival-meetings attended as a youth were the inspiration for the second movement of Charles Ives&#x27; Orchestral Set No. 2, &quot;The Rockstrewn Hills Join in the People&#x27;s Outdoor Meeting&quot;.

<text>U Street station is a rapid transit station on the Green Line of the Washington Metro in the U Street neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

U Street station is located in northwest Washington and serves the U Street neighborhood; nearby attractions include the Lincoln Theatre, the historic restaurant Ben&#x27;s Chili Bowl, and several nightclubs, including The Black Cat and the 9:30 Club. The station is approximately five blocks east of the neighborhood of Adams Morgan.

==Station layout==
U Street station has a single island platform with entrances at either end, leading from U Street at 10th and 13th Streets. Like nearly all non-interchange stations on the Metro, there are two tracks: trains using track E1 head to Greenbelt, while those on E2 are bound for Branch Avenue. This station was among the last to feature the 22-coffer &quot;waffle&quot; ceiling vault design among , , , , and .

==History==
Plans for rapid transit prior to the creation of WMATA in February 1967 focused on the needs of commuters while neglecting some of the District&#x27;s less affluent neighborhoods. Riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 destroyed much of the commercial district around 14th and U Streets and planners hoped that adding a subway stop in that area would stimulate redevelopment. The original 1969 plan called for a line under 13th Street NW with just two stations. However, in 1970, the District of Columbia Council agreed to pay an additional $3 million to add a third station and reroute the Green Line under U Street, and then 14th Street NW. Instead of opening in 1976, the first Green Line stations, including U Street, opened in 1991.

Trains originally serviced this station as Yellow Line trains until Green Line service was formally introduced later that year. Yellow Line service resumed in late 2006 as part of what was initially an 18-month experiment to extend that line to Fort Totten station during non-rush hours and weekends.

On June 10, 2001, Metro Transit Police Officer Marlon C. Morales was killed in the line of duty at this station, while intervening in a fare dispute. A plaque exists outside the 13th Street entrance in his honor.

&quot;Cardozo&quot; was added to the name just before opening, and refers to the nearby Cardozo High School. &quot;African-Amer Civil War Memorial&quot; was added in 1999 when the African American Civil War Memorial was completed at U Street and Vermont Ave NW. With this designation, this station had the longest name in the Metro system at 44 characters, while the shortest station names in the system belong to and . On November 3, 2011, the station was renamed to &quot;U Street&quot; with &quot;African American Civil War Memorial / Cardozo&quot; as a subtitle.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

<text>Columbia Heights station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green Line. Due to successful redevelopment since the station&#x27;s opening, Columbia Heights is one of the busiest Metro stops outside the downtown core, with over four million exits in 2010.

The station is located in Northwest Washington at 14th and Irving Streets (entrances at both the Southwest and Northeast corners), serving both the Columbia Heights and Mount Pleasant neighborhoods. It is also close to the Adams Morgan neighborhood. Service began on September 18, 1999.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

==Station layout==
The station has an island platform located underneath 14th Street, with an entrance at the intersection with Irving Street. It also features the &quot;Arch II&quot; design found at Congress Heights, Georgia Avenue-Petworth, Glenmont, and Mount Vernon Square.
===Public art===
Installed in 1999, &quot;Woven Identities&quot; is a mural and wall sculpture located in the Metro station. Installed as part of the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities public art agenda the piece was created by D.C. architect Meghan Walsh, AIA and youth from Casa Del Pueblo Community Center. A series of painted panels, which appear like mosaics, the mural is abstract featuring faces representing the diversity of the Columbia Heights neighborhood. Neon lights of many colors glow from behind the framed painted mosaics.

<doc id="664270" wikidata="Q2465852" url="?curid=664270" title="Glory (religion)">
<text>Glory (from the Latin &quot;gloria&quot;, &quot;fame, renown&quot;) is used to describe the manifestation of God&#x27;s presence as perceived by humans according to the Abrahamic religions.

Divine glory is an important motif throughout Christian theology, where God is regarded as the &quot;most glorious&quot; being in existence, and it is considered that human beings are created in the Image of God and can share or participate, imperfectly, in divine glory as image-bearers. Thus Christians are instructed to &quot;let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father in heaven&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Glory&quot; is one of the most common praise words in scripture. In the Hebrew Bible, the concept of glory is expressed with several Hebrew words, including &quot;Hod&quot; (הוד) and &quot;kavod&quot; (כָּבוֹד). Later, these original Hebrew Bible concepts for glory were translated in the Christian Testament as the Greek word &quot;doxa&quot; (δόξα). The Hebrew word &quot;kavod&quot; () (K-V-D) has meant &quot;importance&quot;, &quot;weight&quot;, &quot;deference&quot;, or &quot;heaviness&quot;, but primarily &quot;kavod&quot; means &quot;glory&quot;, &quot;respect&quot;, &quot;honor&quot;, and &quot;majesty&quot;. In translating the Hebrew Bible, the Greek word used is &quot;δόξα&quot;, a word also appearing extensively in the New Testament which was originally written in Greek. &quot;Doxa&quot; means &quot;judgment, opinion,&quot; and by extension, &quot;good reputation, honor&quot;. St. Augustine later rendered it as &quot;clara notitia cum laude&quot;, &quot;brilliant celebrity with praise&quot;.

==In the Bible==
===Hebrew Bible===
In , Moses is told that no human being can see the glory ( &quot;kavod&quot;) of Yahweh and survive:

And the Lord said to Moses, &quot;This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.&quot; Moses said, &quot;Please show me your glory.&quot; And he said, &quot;I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name &#x27;the Lord&#x27;. And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.&quot; But, he said, &quot;you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live.&quot; And the Lord said, &quot;Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.&quot;

The prophet Ezekiel writes in his vision: 

And upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness around him. Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.

Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

===New Testament===
In the New Testament, the corresponding word is the , &quot;doxa&quot;, sometimes also translated &quot;brightness&quot;. For example, at the nativity of Christ:

In the countryside close by there were shepherds out in the fields keeping guard over their sheep during the watches of the night. An angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone round them. They were terrified, but the angel said, &#x27;Do not be afraid. Look, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people.&#x27;

In the event known as the Transfiguration of Jesus, Moses and Elijah appeared in glory with Jesus, and the disciples who witnessed this revelation, Peter, James and John, &#x27;saw his glory&#x27;.

In the gospel of John, Jesus says that His destiny begins to be fulfilled when Judas Iscariot sets out to betray Him:
:&quot;Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him&quot; (.

Jesus subsequently addresses a long prayer to His Father in which he says:
:&quot;I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. Now, Father, glorify me with that glory I had with you before ever the world existed&quot;.

==In Catholicism==

Catholic doctrine asserts that the world was created as an act of God&#x27;s free will for his own glory. Catholic doctrine teaches, however, that God does not seek to be glorified for his own sake, but for the sake of mankind that they may know Him.

==In Anglicanism==

The theologian C. S. Lewis, in his essay The Weight of Glory, writes &quot;Glory suggests two ideas to me, of which one seems wicked and the other ridiculous. Either glory means to me fame, or it means luminosity.&quot; He concludes that glory should be understood in the former sense, but states that one should not desire fame before men (human glory), but fame before God (divine glory). Where fame is understood as &quot;not &quot;(fame)&quot; conferred by our fellow creatures—&quot;(but, rather)&quot; fame with God, approval or (I might say) &#x27;appreciation&#x27; by God. And then, when I had thought it over, I saw that this view was scriptural; nothing can eliminate from the parable the divine accolade, &#x27;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.

==In Orthodox Christianity==

Glorification (also referred to as canonization) is the term used in the Orthodox Christian Church for the official recognition of a person as a saint of the Church. The Orthodox Christian term &quot;theosis&quot; is roughly equivalent to the Protestant concept of glorification.

It is in this sense that the resurrected bodies of the righteous will be &quot;glorified&quot; at the Second Coming. As the soul was illuminated through &quot;theosis&quot; so the restored body will be illuminated by the grace of God when it is &quot;changed&quot; at the Parousia (). This glorified body will be like the resurrected body of Jesus (); similar in appearance to the body during life, but of a more refined and spiritualized nature ().

==In Protestantism==
In his dissertation &quot;Concerning the End for which God Created the World&quot;, Jonathan Edwards concludes, &quot;[I]t appears that all that is ever spoken of in the Scripture as an ultimate end of God&#x27;s works is included in that one phrase, &#x27;the glory of God&#x27;.&quot;

There are two events that occur during glorification, these are &quot;the receiving of perfection by the elect before entering into the kingdom of heaven,&quot; and &quot;the receiving of the resurrection bodies by the elect&quot;

Glorification is the third stage of Christian development. The first being justification, then sanctification, and finally glorification. (Rom. 8:28-30) Glorification is the full realization of salvation.

===Receiving of Perfection===
Glorification is the Protestant alternative to the Catholic purgatory, as it is &quot;the means by which the elect receive perfection before entering into the kingdom of Heaven.&quot; Purgatory deals with the means by which the elect become perfect (by suffering physically and emotionally, people are believed to earn their way into heaven) and takes place after physical death; glorification deals with the elect becoming perfect and is a supernatural, ongoing process which takes place during life through the work of the Holy Spirit after people trust in Jesus for their eternal life. The majority of Protestant denominations believe in this form of glorification, although some have alternative names.

===Receiving of the Resurrection Bodies===

After the final judgment, in some doctrines, all the righteous dead will arise and their bodies will be perfected and become glorified bodies, under which form they will live forever under God&#x27;s new Heaven on God&#x27;s New Earth, as described in Revelation, Chapter 21.

==In the Baháʼí Faith==
The Baháʼí Faith claims that Baha&#x27;u&#x27;llah, whose name translates to the Glory of God, is the Messenger of God promised to man by all the older Abrahamic religions, like Christianity, Judaism and Islam. In Baháʼí belief the Greatest Name is Baháʼ (بهاء), translated as &quot;glory&quot; or &quot;splendour.&quot;

==In Islam==
In Islamic belief, God has 99 names, and in some Islamic traditions it is believed that there is a special hidden 100th name which is the greatest.

To glorify God in Islam is one of the four eternal good deeds. Glorifying God (Tasbih, ) is mentioned in many verses in the Quran. For example &quot;The seven heavens and the earth and all beings therein glorify God. There is not a single thing that does not glorify God with praise, but you do not understand their glorification. God is truly clement and forgiving&quot; [Quran 17:44]. The Islamic prophet Muhammad said the eternal good deeds (Arabic: ) are to glorify God (Tasbih), to praise God (Hamed. ), to unify God (Tawhid, ) and to elevate God (Takbir, ). These are eternal good deeds due to their devotional and spiritual meanings as the Muslims understand them. For example, you glorify God because God is impeccable and you are in God&#x27;s wonderful kingdom; you praise God because God is sustaining, ruling and loving you and everyone; you unify God because only God exists and nothing exists beside God; you elevate God so that nothing would remain or be elevated in your heart beside God. Muhammad said &quot;To glorify God, to praise God, to unify God and to elevate God is more pleasing to my heart than everything under the sun.&quot; The Quran says &quot;wealth and children are the gloss of the worldly life, while the eternal good deeds are better&quot; [18:46]. It is a common act of devotion for Muslims to glorify God (33 times), praise God (33 times) and elevate God (33/34 times) after each of the five daily regular prayers following the hadith saying of Muhammad.

Glorification in Islam has many layers of meanings that varies according to one&#x27;s spiritual state and circumstances. Yet all these meanings generally imply viewing God as impeccable and the feeling of wonderment for being in such glorious existence. Among these meanings for example are:
# To glorify God is to have wonderment and integration with the universe, as a child is experiencing a universe that is singing with the child: &quot;We did indeed bestow on David favor from Us: &quot;O mountains, and birds, sing the glory of God along with him.&quot; and we softened iron for him&quot; [Quran 34:10]. 
# To glorify God is to have the heart that stands in wonderment seeing that for God everything is possible through means or without means: &quot;Glory to Him who journeyed His devotee by night, from the Sacred Mosque to the Farthest Mosque, whose precincts We blessed, so We might show him some of Our wonders. For He is the all-hearing, the all-seeing&quot; [Quran 17:1].
# To glorify God is to view God as impeccable; that is to cleanse bad thoughts that you have about God: &quot;Then the whale swallowed him, and he was blameworthy. If not for the fact that he was one who glorified God, he would have remained inside its guts until the day they are resurrected&quot; [Quran 37:142-144]. 
# To glorify God is to free one&#x27;s mind from constrained conceptions that you have about God without knowledge: &quot;Yet they considered sprites partners to God, though God created them; and they falsely attribute sons and daughters to God, without knowledge. Glory be to God, exalted beyond what they describe&quot; [Quran 6:100].
These are just few meanings, yet the glorification of God (Tasbih) is mentioned in more than 90 verses in the Quran and in many hadith sayings of Muhammad.

==Human glory==

In comparison to the desire for glory from God, stands the desire for glory from man. Thomas Aquinas, in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, cautions that an inordinate desire of glory, or praise, from man is a sin. He lists vainglory as a capital vice and, in some cases, as a mortal sin, cf. quotation. However, this is not to be confused with the desire for what Aquinas calls &quot;honours&quot;, which Aquinas considered a good, and embraces a moderate and reasoned pursuance of.

According to the Book of Revelation 20.11-15, the dead in Christ will receive a perfect glorified body at the first resurrection; those saints alive will be transformed into a glorified perfect body. The second resurrection is for the white throne judgement. Those not resurrected in the first resurrection will be resurrected for judgement to include those born during the thousand-year kingdom. Those whose names do not appear in the book of life will be thrown in the lake of fire.

==In art==
 The manifestation of glory (upon a saint for example) is often depicted in iconography using the religious symbol of a halo. Other common symbols of glory include white robes, crowns, jewels, gold, and stars. The Coronation of the Virgin is one of the most common depictions of Mary in glory.

There are a number of specialised senses of &quot;glory&quot; in art, which all derive from French usages of &quot;gloire&quot;. &quot;Glory&quot; was the medieval English word for a halo or aureole, and continues to be used sometimes in this sense, mostly for the full-body version. The subject of Christ in Majesty is also known as &quot;Christ in Glory&quot;, and in general any depiction of a sacred person in heaven (e.g. in the clouds, surrounded by angels) can be called a &quot;glory&quot;, although this sense is obsolete.

<text>Our Mutual Friend, published in 1864–1865, is the last novel completed by English author Charles Dickens and is one of his most sophisticated works, combining savage satire with social analysis. It centres on, in the words of critic J. Hillis Miller, quoting the book&#x27;s character Bella Wilfer, &quot;money, money, money, and what money can make of life&quot;.

Most reviewers in the 1860s continued to praise Dickens&#x27;s skill as a writer in general, but did not review this novel in detail. Some found the plot both too complex and not well laid out. &quot;The Times&quot; of London found the first few chapters did not draw the reader into the characters. In the 20th century, however, reviewers began to find much to approve in the later novels of Dickens, including &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, some reviewers suggested that Dickens was, in fact, experimenting with structure, and that the characters considered somewhat flat and not recognized by the contemporary reviewers were meant rather to be true representations of the Victorian working class and the key to understanding the structure of the society depicted by Dickens in the novel.

==Characters==
===Major characters===
* John Harmon – is heir to the Harmon estate, under the condition that he marry Bella Wilfer. He is presumed dead throughout most of the novel, though he is living under the name John Rokesmith, and working as a secretary for the Boffins in an attempt to better get to know Bella, the Boffins, and people&#x27;s general reaction to John Harmon&#x27;s &quot;death&quot;. Harmon also uses the alias Julius Handford upon first returning to London. Harmon&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; and subsequent resurrection as Rokesmith/Handford is consistent with Dickens&#x27;s recurring theme in the novel of rebirth from the water. His upward social mobility through his own efforts is presented as favourable, in contrast with Headstone, Hexam, and the Lammles.
* Isabella &quot;Bella&quot; Wilfer – is a beautiful young woman born into a poor family, who learns upon the death of Old Mr Harmon that she is the intended wife for his son, a condition of his inheritance. When her intended husband, John Harmon, is reported to have been killed, she is left without future prospects. She learns of the trouble money can bring when taken in by the newly rich Boffins. Bella rejects Rokesmith&#x27;s proposal at first but later accepts it. Initially described as a &quot;mercenary young woman&quot;, who describes herself upon meeting Lizzie Hexam as having &quot;no more character than a canary bird&quot;, Bella undergoes a significant moral change in the novel. Although originally completely preoccupied with money, her complexity is eventually displayed in her ability to defy the societal pressures to achieve happiness unrelated to wealth. She is praised for her &quot;vivacity and lifelikeness&quot;, with greater complexity than some of the other, more static characters. Her relationship with her father is more like that of a mother and son, as she consistently dotes upon him, calling him her &quot;cherub&quot;. Her open and warm relationship with her father contrasts with her strained and resentful relationships with her mother and sister.
* Nicodemus (Noddy) Boffin, the Golden Dustman – becomes a member of the &quot;nouveaux riches&quot; when Old Mr Harmon&#x27;s heir is considered dead. He is illiterate, but wants to fit the image of a wealthy man, and so hires Silas Wegg to read to him in hopes of gaining more intelligence and worldliness. He is nearly blackmailed by Wegg. He assumes the role of a miser to show Bella the dangers of wealth, but eventually admits this behaviour was an act and gives his money to Bella and John. Boffin&#x27;s innocence, naïve curiosity, and desire to learn in his new position in life contrast with his &quot;elaborate performances as Boffin the miser&quot;. Critics speculate that Dickens&#x27;s decision to have Boffin playing a part may not have been planned, as it was not very convincing for a man who has shown his simplistic ignorance on several occasions. Boffin&#x27;s inheritance of Old Harmon&#x27;s money is appropriate because Harmon had attained it by combing the dust heaps, because this suggests social mobility. Boffin represents a wholesome contrast to such wealthy characters as the Veneerings and Podsnaps, and may have been based on Henry Dodd, a ploughboy who made his fortune removing London&#x27;s rubbish.
* Mrs Henrietta Boffin – is Noddy Boffin&#x27;s wife, and a very motherly woman, who convinces Mr Boffin to take in an orphan boy called Johnny. This indicates &quot;another progressive development for Dickens as his female characters undertake a more active role in social reform&quot;. 
* Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Hexam – is a daughter of Gaffer Hexam and sister of Charley Hexam. She is an affectionate daughter, but knows that Charley must escape their living circumstances if he is to succeed in life, so she gives Charley her money and helps him leave while their father is away. Later she is rejected by Charley after she remains in poverty. Pursued romantically by both Bradley Headstone and Eugene Wrayburn, she fears Headstone&#x27;s violent passion and yearns for Wrayburn&#x27;s love, while acutely aware of the social gap between them. Lizzie saves Wrayburn from Headstone&#x27;s attack and the two are married. She in effect acts as the moral centre of the story and is by far the &quot;most wholly good character […] almost bereft of ego&quot;. Dickens carries over her moral superiority into her physical characterisation. Her &quot;capacity for self-sacrifice […] is only slightly more credible than her gift for refined speech&quot;, making her slightly unbelievable in comparison to her uneducated father and Jenny Wren. Lizzie&#x27;s concern about social class reveals her reasoning for ensuring her brother&#x27;s escape from poverty and ignorance, though she remains humble about her own situation. However, her moral character attracts Wrayburn and her inherent goodness is rewarded with marital happiness.
* Charley Hexam – is the son of Jesse &quot;Gaffer&quot; Hexam and brother of Lizzie. Originally a very caring brother, this changes as he rises above Lizzie in class and must remove himself from her to maintain his social standing. He was born into poverty, but receives schooling and becomes a teacher under Headstone&#x27;s mentoring. Dickens uses him to critique both the schooling available to the poor, which was often over-crowded and noisy, as well as the snobbish tendencies of those who manage to rise in status. Hexam is presented as &quot;morally corrupt&quot;, because of how he distances himself from his past, and from his loving sister, in the name of his own upward movement.
* Mortimer Lightwood – is a lawyer, who is an acquaintance of the Veneerings and a friend of Eugene Wrayburn. Lightwood acts as the &quot;storyteller&quot; and it is through him that the reader and the other characters learn about Harmon&#x27;s will. However, under the &quot;mask of irony&quot; he assumes in telling his stories, he feels true friendship for Eugene, respect for Twemlow, and concern for the issues in which he is involved. In addition, he also serves as the &quot;commentator and a voice of conscience&quot; with sarcasm sometimes covering his concern. Through Lightwood&#x27;s reason and advice, the reader is better able to judge the characters&#x27; actions.
* Eugene Wrayburn – who is seen as the novel&#x27;s second hero, is a barrister, and a gentleman by birth, though he is roguish and insolent. He is a close friend of Mortimer Lightwood, and involved in a love triangle with Lizzie Hexam and Bradley Headstone. Both these characters act as foils to Wrayburn. Lizzie contrasts with Eugene&#x27;s more negative traits and Headstone makes Eugene appear more virtuous. He is nearly killed by Headstone but, like Harmon/Rokesmith, &quot;reborn&quot; after his incident in the river. Though Wrayburn appears morally grey through most of the novel, by the end he is seen as a moral, sympathetic character and a true gentleman, after choosing to marry Lizzie in order to save her reputation, even though she is socially below him.
* Jenny Wren – whose real name is Fanny Cleaver, is &quot;the dolls&#x27; dressmaker&quot;, with whom Lizzie lives after her father dies. She is disabled with a bad back and limited leg mobility. She is very motherly towards her drunken father, whom she calls her &quot;bad child&quot;. Jenny later cares for Eugene while he recovers from Headstone&#x27;s attack on his life. She may have a romance with Sloppy at the end of the book, which the reader may surmise will end in marriage. Although her mannerisms give her a certain &quot;strangeness&quot;, Jenny is very perceptive, identifying Eugene Wrayburn&#x27;s intentions towards Lizzie in his small actions. Her role is a creator and a caretaker, and her &quot;pleasant fancies&quot; of &quot;flowers, bird song, numbers of blessed, white-clad children&quot; reflect the mind&#x27;s ability to rise above adverse circumstances.
* Mr Riah – is a Jew who manages Mr Fledgeby&#x27;s money-lending business. He cares for and assists Lizzie Hexam and Jenny Wren when they have no one else. Some critics believe that Riah was meant by Dickens to act as an apology for his stereotyping of Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and in particular a response to Mrs Eliza Davis. She had written to Dickens complaining that &quot;the portrayal of Fagin did &#x27;a great wrong&#x27; to all Jews.&quot; However, some still take issue with Riah, asserting that he is &quot;too gentle to be a believable human being.&quot;
* Bradley Headstone – began life as a pauper but rose to become Charley Hexam&#x27;s schoolmaster and the love interest of Miss Peecher. However, he ignores her and falls in love with Lizzie Hexam, whom he pursues passionately and violently, though his advances are rejected. He then develops an insane jealousy towards Eugene Wrayburn, whom he follows at night like an &quot;ill-tamed wild animal&quot; in hopes of catching him with Lizzie together. He disguises himself as Rogue Riderhood and almost succeeds in drowning Wrayburn. After Riderhood realises that Headstone is impersonating him to incriminate him for Wrayburn&#x27;s murder, he attempts to blackmail Headstone, and this leads to a fight, and both men drowning in the river. Described repeatedly as &quot;decent&quot; and &quot;constrained&quot;, Headstone&#x27;s personality splits between &quot;painfully respectable&quot; and &quot;wild jealousy&quot;, with a &quot;passion terrible in its violence&quot;. He is presented by Dickens as an animal in the night and a respectable, &quot;mechanical&quot; schoolteacher during the day. A possible explanation for this dichotomy may be Headstone&#x27;s &quot;intellectual insecurity&quot;, that manifests itself in violence after Lizzie&#x27;s rejection. The &quot;most complex of Dickens&#x27;s villain-murderers are presented as such double-figures&quot;. Dickens here demonstrates the way identity can be manipulated. Headstone also serves as a foil to Wrayburn, and his evil nature antagonizes Wrayburn, as much as Lizzie&#x27;s goodness helps him.
* Silas Wegg – is a ballad-seller, and has a wooden leg. He is a &quot;social parasite&quot;, hired to read for the Boffins and teach Mr Boffin how to read, despite not being entirely literate himself. Wegg finds Harmon&#x27;s will in the dust heaps, and he and Venus attempt to use it to blackmail the Boffins. He wishes to buy back his own leg as soon as he has the money, which is an attempt to &quot;complete himself&quot;. Wegg claims to want the leg so that he can be seen as respectable. Some critics find the juxtaposition of Wegg&#x27;s villainy and his sense of humour to be inconsistent.
* Mr Venus – a taxidermist and articulator of bones, who is in love with Pleasant Riderhood, whom he eventually marries. He meets Silas Wegg after having procured his amputated leg and he pretends to join Silas in blackmailing Mr Boffin regarding Harmon&#x27;s will, while really informing Boffin of Silas&#x27;s scheme. Dickens is said to have based Mr Venus on a real taxidermist named J Willis, although Venus&#x27;s &quot;defining obsession&quot; renders him &quot;among Dickens&#x27;s most outlandish, least realistic&quot; characters.
* Mr Alfred Lammle – is married to Sophronia Lammle. Both of them, at the time of their marriage, were under the false impression that the other was fairly wealthy. Subsequently, they are forced to use their overabundance of charm and superficiality in attempts to make influential acquaintances and gain money through them.
* Mrs Sophronia Lammle – is described, early in the novel, as &quot;the mature young lady&quot; and a proper young woman. However, this turns out to be ironic as she is later shown to be greedy, cold, and manipulative. She married Alfred Lammle because she believed he had money, and when it turned out he did not, the two of them formed a partnership that involves swindling money from others. They, for example, conspire to trap Georgiana Podsnap in a marriage with Fledgeby, though Sophronia repents before this plan can come to fruition, and arranges for Twemlow to inform the Podsnaps without her husband&#x27;s knowledge.
* Georgiana Podsnap – a daughter of Mr and Mrs Podsnap, who is very sheltered, shy, trusting and naïve. Because of this she is taken advantage of by more manipulative upper-class characters, such as Fledgeby and the Lammles, who scheme to &quot;befriend&quot; her and take her money. She is courted by Fledgeby, through Alfred Lammle, although not with honourable intentions, and nearly finds herself trapped in a marriage with Fledgeby until Sophronia Lammle suffers a change of heart.
* Mr Fledgeby – &quot;Fascination&quot; Fledgeby is a friend of the Lammles. He owns Mr Riah&#x27;s moneylending business, is greedy and corrupt, and makes his money through speculation. He provides a contrast with Mr Riah&#x27;s gentleness, and underlines the point that &quot;a Jew may be kindly and a Christian cruel&quot;. Fledgeby nearly marries Georgiana Podsnap to gain access to her money, but Sophronia Lammle backs out of the scheme and, once Fledgeby is no longer allied with the Lammles, they seek him out and beat him.
* Roger &quot;Rogue&quot; Riderhood – &quot;Gaffer&quot; Hexam&#x27;s partner until Gaffer rejects him when he is convicted of theft. In revenge for that slight he falsely turns Gaffer in as the murderer of John Harmon, in the hope of receiving a reward. Later, Riderhood becomes a lock-keeper, and Headstone attempts to frame him for the murder of Eugene Wrayburn. After attempts to blackmail Headstone, the two men fall in the river Thames during a fight and both drown. In his &quot;literally irredeemable villainy&quot;, Riderhood represents an opportunistic character who will change his behaviour according to whatever suits his needs best at any given moment.
* Reginald &quot;Rumty&quot; Wilfer – is Bella Wilfer&#x27;s doting father, who is gentle, innocent, fatherly, and kindly, despite his querulous wife and daughter and thankless work as a clerk. Dickens describes him in almost childish terms, and he is often called &quot;the Cherub&quot;.

===Minor characters===
* Mr Inspector – a police officer, who acts as a witness to several important events, such as when the corpse from the river is mistakenly identified as John Harmon, when Gaffer Hexam is taken into custody, and when the real John Harmon is named. In general, he is &quot;imperturbable, omnicompetent, firm but genial, and an accomplished actor&quot;, who commands authority. However he is not particularly effective in his administration of the law, and this leads to doubt about the justice system in the novel.
* Mr John Podsnap – a pompous man of the upper middle class, married to Mrs Podsnap and the father of Georgiana, who is smug and jingoistic. Some critics believe that Dickens used Podsnap to satirise John Forster, Dickens&#x27;s lifelong friend and official biographer. However, Dickens insisted he only used some of Forster&#x27;s mannerisms for this character, who was in no way to represent his closest friend. Forster, like Dickens, rose with difficulty from an impoverished middle-class background. The character of Podsnap was used to represent the views of &quot;Society&quot;, as shown in his disapproval of Lizzie Hexam and Eugene Wrayburn&#x27;s marriage.
* Mrs Podsnap – the mother of Georgiana Podsnap. Though she embodies the materialistic ideals of her husband and daughter, Mrs Podsnap is the least prominent of the family. She is described as a &quot;fine woman&quot; in her embodiment of the typical upper middle class wife.
* Mrs Wilfer – Bella&#x27;s mother, a woman who is never satisfied with what she has. Her haughtiness is apparent in the way she acts at the Boffins&#x27; home and when Bella and Rokesmith return after their wedding. Her animosity towards her husband, her greed and discontent contrast with her husband&#x27;s good nature and provide an image of what Bella could become, should she not change.
* Lavinia Wilfer – Bella&#x27;s younger sister and George Sampson&#x27;s fiancée. Vocal and opinionated, she is the only character who will stand up to Mrs Wilfer by matching her derisiveness and audacity. In some ways, she acts as a foil to Bella, and while Bella overcomes her desire for money and appreciates other aspects of life, Lavinia remains resentful in her poverty.
* George Sampson – Lavinia Wilfer&#x27;s suitor, who was originally in love with Bella. He provides comic relief and a contrast with the idyllic relationship between Bella and Rokesmith/Harmon.
* Mr Melvin Twemlow – the well-connected friend of the Veneerings, who is often cultivated for his supposed influence with powerful people, such as his first cousin, Lord Snigsworth. Mrs Lammle tells him about their plot to marry Georgiana Podsnap and Fledgeby, to whom Twemlow owes money. Though Twemlow is introduced as being as insensible as a table at the Veneerings&#x27; dinner party, he comes to reflect a wise way of thinking. His wearing of a collar and cravat creates a &quot;picturesque and archaic&quot; impression, and he proves himself a &quot;true gentleman in his response to Wrayburn&#x27;s marriage&quot;.
* Mrs Betty Higden – a child-minder, who takes in poor children and cares for them, including Johnny, the orphan whom the Boffins plan to adopt before he dies in the children&#x27;s hospital. She is old and poor, and portrayed sympathetically as pitiable. She is so terrified of dying in the workhouse that, when she begins to grow sick, she runs away to the country and ends up dying in Lizzie Hexam&#x27;s arms. Mrs Higden draws readers&#x27; attention to the miserable lives led by the poor, and the need for social reform.
* Johnny – the orphan great-grandson of Betty Higden. The Boffins plan on adopting Johnny, but he dies in the Children&#x27;s Hospital before they are able to do so.
* Sloppy – a foundling who assists Betty Higden in taking care of children. Raised in the workhouse, he has a learning disability, but is nevertheless adept at reading the newspaper for Mrs Higden. He is portrayed as inherently innocent because of his disability, and carts away Wegg at the end of the novel. 
* Jesse &quot;Gaffer&quot; Hexam – a waterman and the father of Lizzie and Charley, who makes a living by robbing corpses found in the river Thames. His former partner, Rogue Riderhood, turns him in for the murder of John Harmon after Harmon&#x27;s body is supposedly dragged from the river. A search is mounted to find and arrest Gaffer, but he is discovered dead in his boat. Gaffer&#x27;s opposition to education prompts Lizzie to sneak Charley away to school, though she stays with her father. As a result, Gaffer disowns Charley as a son. In a sense, Gaffer predicted the alienating effect education would have on Charley.
* Pleasant Riderhood – the daughter of Rogue Riderhood, who works in a pawn shop, and, like Jenny Wren and Lizzie Hexam, is another daughter caring for her abusive father as though he were her child, and who, in vain, tries to steer him along the path of right. She eventually marries Mr Venus.
* Mr and Mrs Veneering – a nouveau-riche husband and wife whose main preoccupation is to advance in the social world. They invite influential people to their dinner parties where their furniture gleams with a sheen that they also put on to make themselves seem more impressive. They &quot;wear&quot; their acquaintances, their possessions, and their wealth like jewellery, in an attempt to impress those around them. Veneering eventually goes bankrupt and they retire to France to live on the jewels he bought for his wife.
* Miss Abbey Potterson – mistress of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, she keeps the inn respectable, and only allows patrons to drink as much as she sees fit. She is likened, humorously, to a schoolmistress, linking her to the novel&#x27;s concern with education.
* Miss Peecher – a school teacher who is in love with Bradley Headstone. She is a &quot;good and harmless&quot; character, though she displays an &quot;addiction to rules and forms&quot;. In addition, she shows a &quot;naive confidence in the outward appearance of things&quot;, as demonstrated by her love of Headstone, a villain who gives the impression of being good.
* Mr Dolls – Jenny Wren&#x27;s alcoholic father. Jenny calls him her &quot;bad child&quot;, and treats him accordingly. His real name is not known to Eugene, so Eugene calls him &quot;Mr Dolls&quot;. As his daughter is really named Fanny Cleaver, his name might be Mr Cleaver, but he is never called by a name other than &quot;my bad child&quot;, or &quot;Mr Dolls&quot; in the novel.
* George Radfoot – third mate on the ship bringing John Harmon back to England, whose dead body, found in the river by Gaffer Hexam, is identified as being Harmon, because of the papers found in his pockets. He had been involved in crimes and schemes with Riderhood, who most likely was responsible for trying to kill Harmon and killing Radfoot.

==Plot summary==
Having made his fortune from London&#x27;s rubbish, the rich misanthropic miser Mr Harmon dies, estranged from all except his faithful employees Mr and Mrs Boffin. By his will, his fortune goes to his estranged son John Harmon, who is to return from his home abroad (possibly in South Africa) to claim it, on condition that he marries a woman he has never met, Miss Bella Wilfer. The implementation of the will is in the charge of the solicitor, Mortimer Lightwood, who has no other practice.

The son and heir does not appear, though some knew him aboard the ship to London. A body is found in the Thames by Gaffer Hexam, rowed by his daughter Lizzie. He is a waterman who makes his living by retrieving corpses and taking the cash in their pockets, before handing them over to the authorities. Papers in the pockets of the drowned man identify him as Harmon. Present at the identification of the water-soaked corpse is a mysterious young man, who gives his name as Julius Handford and then disappears.

The elder Harmon&#x27;s estate devolves upon Mr and Mrs Boffin, naïve and good-hearted people who wish to enjoy it for themselves and to share it with others. The childless couple take pity on Miss Bella Wilfer, whose fortunes are thought to have been lost with the death of John Harmon, and take her into their household, and treat her as their pampered child and heiress. Bella is disgusted by her lower middle class upbringing, and obsessed with marrying a wealthy man. They also accept an offer from Julius Handford, now going under the name of John Rokesmith, to serve as their confidential secretary and man of business, at no salary for a trial period of two years. Rokesmith uses this position to watch and learn everything about the Boffins, Miss Wilfer, and the aftershock of the drowning of Harmon. Mr Boffin engages a one-legged ballad-seller, Silas Wegg, to read aloud to him in the evenings, and Wegg tries to take advantage of his position and of Mr Boffin&#x27;s good heart to obtain other advantages from the wealthy dustman. When the Boffins purchase a large home, Wegg is invited to live in the old Harmon home. Wegg hopes to find hidden treasure in the house or in the mounds of trash on the property.

Gaffer Hexam, who found the body, is accused of murdering Harmon by a fellow waterman, Roger &quot;Rogue&quot; Riderhood, who is bitter at having been cast off as Hexam&#x27;s partner, and who covets the large reward offered in relation to the murder. As a result of the accusation, Hexam is shunned by his fellows on the river, and excluded from The Six Jolly Fellowship-Porters, the public house they frequent. Hexam&#x27;s young son, the clever but priggish Charley Hexam, leaves his father&#x27;s house to better himself at school, and to train to be a schoolmaster, encouraged by his sister, the beautiful Lizzie Hexam. Lizzie stays with her father, to whom she is devoted.

Before Riderhood can claim the reward for his false allegation, Hexam is found drowned himself. Lizzie Hexam becomes the lodger of a doll&#x27;s dressmaker, a disabled teenager nicknamed &quot;Jenny Wren&quot;. Jenny&#x27;s alcoholic father lives with them, and is treated by Jenny as a child. A sub-plot involves the activities of the devious Mr and Mrs Lammle, a couple who have married each other for money, only to discover that neither has any. They attempt to obtain financial advantage by pairing off Fledgeby to the naive heiress Georgiana Podsnap. Fledgeby is an extortioner and money-lender, who uses the kindly old Jew Riah as his cover, temporarily causing Riah to fall out with his friend and protégée Jenny Wren.

The work-shy barrister Eugene Wrayburn notices Lizzie when accompanying his friend and business partner Mortimer Lightwood to Gaffer Hexam&#x27;s home and falls in love with her. However, he soon gains a violent rival in Bradley Headstone, Charley Hexam&#x27;s schoolmaster. Charley wants his sister to be under obligation to no one but him, and tries to arrange lessons for her with Headstone, only to find that Wrayburn has already engaged a teacher for both Lizzie and Jenny. Headstone quickly develops an unreasonable passion for Lizzie, and makes an unsuccessful proposal, which Lizzie firmly but kindly refuses. Angered by being refused, and by Wrayburn&#x27;s dismissive attitude towards him, Headstone comes to see Wrayburn as the source of all his misfortunes, and takes to following him around the streets of London at night. Lizzie fears Headstone&#x27;s threats to Wrayburn, and is unsure of Wrayburn&#x27;s intentions toward her (Wrayburn admits to Lightwood that he does not know his own intentions yet, either). She flees both men, getting work up-river from London, with the help of Mr Riah.

Mr and Mrs Boffin attempt to adopt a young orphan, in the care of his great-grandmother, Betty Higden, but the boy dies. Mrs Higden minds children for a living, assisted by a foundling known as Sloppy. When Lizzie Hexam finds Mrs Higden dying and stops to care for her, she meets the Boffins and Bella Wilfer.

Rokesmith is in love with Bella Wilfer, but she cannot bear to accept him, having insisted that she will marry only for money. Mr Boffin appears to be corrupted by his wealth, and obsessed with biographies of misers. He begins to treat Rokesmith with contempt, stinginess, and cruelty. This arouses Bella Wilfer&#x27;s sympathy, and when the Lammles (hoping to take Bella and Rokesmith&#x27;s place as Mr Boffin&#x27;s favorites) reveal to Mr Boffin that Rokesmith has proposed to Bella, and he dismisses Rokesmith, Bella stands up for him. Rokesmith and Bella marry and live happily, though in relatively poor circumstances. Bella soon conceives.

In the meantime, Wrayburn has obtained information about Lizzie&#x27;s whereabouts from Jenny&#x27;s father, and finds the object of his affections. Headstone engages with Riderhood, now working as a lock-keeper, as Headstone is consumed with executing his threats against Wrayburn. After following Wrayburn up river and seeing him with Lizzie, Headstone attacks Wrayburn and leaves him for dead. Headstone tries to place blame for the assault on Rogue Riderhood by dressing in similar clothes when doing the deed and throwing his own clothes in the river. Riderhood fetches the bundle of clothing. Lizzie finds Wrayburn in the river and rescues him, with Jenny&#x27;s help, who has discovered Fledgeby&#x27;s trick, and reconciled with Mr Riah. Wrayburn, on his deathbed, marries Lizzie, and suppresses any hint that Headstone was his attacker to save her reputation. When he survives, he is glad that his near-death experience brought him into a loving marriage; although her social inferiority had not bothered him, he believes Lizzie would not otherwise have married him due to the social gulf between them.

Headstone learns Wrayburn is alive, recovering from the brutal beating, and married to Lizzie; he is overcome with the hopelessness of his situation. Riderhood attempts to blackmail Headstone. Confronted by Riderhood in his classroom, Headstone is seized with a self-destructive urge and flings himself into the lock, pulling Riderhood with him; both drown.

Meanwhile, Silas Wegg has, with help from Mr Venus (an &quot;articulator of bones&quot;), searched the dust mounds and discovered a later will of the Elder Harmon, which bequeaths his estate to the Crown rather than the Boffins. Wegg decides to blackmail Boffin, but Venus has second thoughts and reveals the plot to Boffin.

It gradually becomes clear to the reader that John Rokesmith is in fact John Harmon. Harmon had switched clothes with his shipmate en route to London, because Harmon wanted an opportunity to learn about his betrothed before claiming his inheritance; the shipmate agreed, with the intention of stealing Harmon&#x27;s money. However, Riderhood had drugged, robbed, and dumped both Harmon and his shipmate in the river. Harmon survived the attempted murder, and maintained his alias to try to win Bella Wilfer for himself, rather than his inheritance. Now that she has married him, believing him to be poor, he throws off his disguise. It is revealed that Mr Boffin&#x27;s apparent miserliness and ill-treatment of his secretary were part of a scheme to test Bella&#x27;s motives.

When Wegg attempts to clinch his blackmail on the basis of the later will, Boffin turns the tables by revealing a still later will by which the fortune is granted to Boffin even at young John Harmon&#x27;s expense. The Boffins are determined to make the Harmons their heirs anyway, so all ends well, except for Wegg, who is carted away by Sloppy. Sloppy himself becomes friendly with Jenny Wren, whose father has died.

==Historical contexts==

===Dickens and &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;===
Inspiration for &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; possibly came from Richard Henry Horne&#x27;s essay &quot;Dust; or Ugliness Redeemed&quot;, published in &quot;Household Words&quot; in 1850, which contains a number of situations and characters that are found in the novel. These include a dust heap, in which a legacy lies buried, a man with a wooden leg, who has an acute interest in the dust heap, Silas Wegg, and another character, Jenny Wren, with &quot;poor withered legs&quot;. In 1862 Dickens jotted down in his notebook: &quot;LEADING INCIDENT FOR A STORY. A man—young and eccentric?—feigns to be dead, and is dead to all intents and purposes, and ... for years retains that singular view of life and character&quot;. Additionally, Dickens&#x27;s longtime friend John Forster was a possible model for the wealthy, pompous John Podsnap.

&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; was published in nineteen monthly numbers, in the fashion of many earlier Dickens novels, for the first time since &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1855–57). &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1859) and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1860–61) had been serialised in Dickens&#x27;s weekly magazine &quot;All the Year Round.&quot; Dickens remarked to Wilkie Collins that he was &quot;quite dazed&quot; at the prospect of putting out twenty monthly parts after more recent weekly serials.

&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; was the first of Dickens&#x27;s novels not illustrated by Hablot Browne, with whom he had collaborated since &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836–37). Dickens chose instead the younger Marcus Stone and, uncharacteristically, left much of the illustrating process to Stone&#x27;s discretion. After suggesting only a few slight alterations for the cover, for instance, Dickens wrote to Stone: &quot;All perfectly right. Alterations quite satisfactory. Everything very pretty&quot;. Stone&#x27;s encounter with a taxidermist named Willis provided the basis for Dickens&#x27;s Mr Venus, after Dickens had indicated he was searching for an uncommon occupation (&quot;it must be something very striking and unusual&quot;) for the novel.

Dickens, who was aware that it was now taking him longer than before to write, made sure he had built up a safety net of five serial numbers before the first went to publication for May 1864. He was at work on number sixteen when he was involved in the traumatic Staplehurst rail crash. Following the crash, and while tending to the injured among the &quot;dead and dying,&quot; Dickens went back to the carriage to rescue the manuscript from his overcoat. With the resulting stress, from which Dickens would never fully recover, he came up two and a half pages short for the sixteenth serial, published in August 1865. Dickens acknowledged this close brush with death, that nearly cut short the composition of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, in the novel&#x27;s postscript:
On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year, Mr and Mrs Boffin (in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast) were on the South-Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident. When I had done what I could to help others, I climbed back into my carriage—nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn—to extricate the worthy couple. They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt. [...] I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever than I was then, until there shall be written against my life, the two words with which I have this day closed this book:—THE END.
Dickens was travelling with Ellen Ternan and her mother. 

===Marriage===
In &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; Dickens explores the conflict between doing what society expects and the idea of being true to oneself. With regard to this the influence of the family is important. In many of Dickens&#x27;s novels, including &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, parents try to force their children into arranged marriages. John Harmon, for example, was supposed to marry Bella to suit the conditions of his father&#x27;s will, and though, initially, he refused to marry her for that reason, he later married her for love. Harmon goes against his father&#x27;s wishes in another way when, by taking the alias of John Rokesmith, he refuses his inheritance. Bella is also swayed by the influence of her parents. Her mother wishes her to marry for money to better the fortunes of the entire family, although her father is happy with her marrying John Rokesmith for love. Bella&#x27;s marriage to Rokesmith goes against what is expected of her by her mother, but eventually her mother accepts the fact that Bella has at least married someone who will make her happy. However, later on in the novel, Bella accepts the everyday duties of a wife, and seemingly gives up her independence. Yet she refuses to be the &quot;doll in the doll&#x27;s house&quot;; and is not content with being a wife who rarely leaves her home without her husband. Furthermore, Bella reads up on the current events so that she can discuss them with her husband, and is actively involved in all of the couple&#x27;s important decisions.

Lizzie Hexam also objects to the expectation of marriage to Eugene Wrayburn, because she sees the difference in their social class status. Without marriage, their connection risks her reputation. She does not aspire to marrying Wrayburn even though she loves him and would be elevated in society simply by marrying him, which almost any woman would have done at the time. Lizzie feels that she is unworthy of him. Wrayburn, however, feels that he is unworthy of such a good woman. He also knows that his father would disapprove of her low social status. She goes against expectations when she refuses to marry Bradley Headstone. He would have been an excellent match for her by social class, according to norms of the time, however, Lizzie does not love him. She unselfishly does what others expect of her, like helping Charley escape their father to go to school, and living with Jenny Wren. Marrying Wrayburn is the only truly selfish act Lizzie commits in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, out of her love for him, when he made up his mind to ask her.

===Status of women===
Because of the rapid increase in wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution, women gained power through their households and class positions. It was up to the women in Victorian society to display their family&#x27;s rank by decorating their households. This directly influenced the man&#x27;s business and class status. Upper-class homes were ornate, as well as packed full of materials, so that &quot;A lack of clutter was to be considered in bad taste.&quot; Through handcrafts and home improvement, women asserted their power over the household: &quot;The making of a true home is really our peculiar and inalienable right: a right, which no man can take from us; for a man can no more make a home than a drone can make a hive&quot; (Frances Cobbe).

===Jews===
The Jewish characters in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; are more sympathetic than Fagin in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;. In 1854, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; had asked why &quot;Jews alone should be excluded from the &#x27;sympathizing heart&#x27; of this great author and powerful friend of the oppressed.&quot; Dickens (who had extensive knowledge of London street life and child exploitation) explained that he had made Fagin Jewish because &quot;it unfortunately was true, of the time to which the story refers, that that class of criminal almost invariably was a Jew&quot;. Dickens commented that by calling Fagin a Jew he had meant no imputation against the Jewish faith, saying in a letter, &quot;I have no feeling towards the Jews but a friendly one. I always speak well of them, whether in public or private, and bear my testimony (as I ought to do) to their perfect good faith in such transactions as I have ever had with them&quot;. Eliza Davis, whose husband had purchased Dickens&#x27;s home in 1860 when he had put it up for sale, wrote to Dickens in June 1863 urging that &quot;Charles Dickens the large hearted, whose works please so eloquently and so nobly for the oppressed of his country ... has encouraged a vile prejudice against the despised Hebrew.&quot; Dickens responded that he had always spoken well of Jews and held no prejudice against them. Replying, Mrs Davis asked Dickens to &quot;examine more closely into the manners and character of the British Jews and to represent them as they really are.&quot;

In his article, &quot;Dickens and the Jews,&quot; Harry Stone claims that this &quot;incident apparently brought home to Dickens the irrationality of some of his feelings about Jews; at any rate, it helped, along with the changing times, to move him more swiftly in the direction of active sympathy for them.&quot; Riah in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; is a Jewish moneylender yet (contrary to stereotype) a profoundly sympathetic character, as can be seen especially in his relationship with Lizzie and Jenny Wren; Jenny calls him her &quot;fairy godmother&quot; and Lizzie refers to Riah as her &quot;protector&quot;, after he finds her a job in the country and risks his own welfare to keep her whereabouts a secret from Fledgeby (his rapacious—and Christian—master).

==Water imagery==

A major symbol is the River Thames, which is linked to the major theme of rebirth and renewal. Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated with the Christian sacrament of Baptism. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the river, and come out reborn. Wrayburn emerges from the river close to death, but is ready to marry Lizzie, and to avoid naming his attacker to save her reputation. He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer pulls a body dressed like Harmon out of the waters, Harmon adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; he wants to know that he can do things on his own, and does not need his father&#x27;s name or money to make a good life for himself.

Dickens uses many images that relate to water. Phrases such as the &quot;depths and shallows of Podsnappery,&quot; and the &quot;time had come for flushing and flourishing this man down for good&quot;, are examples of such imagery. Some critics see this as being used excessively.

==Themes==
Aside from examining the novel&#x27;s form and characters, modern critics of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; have focused on identifying and analysing what they perceive as the main themes of the novel. Although Stanley Friedman&#x27;s 1973 essay &quot;The Motif of Reading in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;&quot; emphasises references to literacy and illiteracy in the novel, Friedman states, &quot;Money, the dust-heaps, and the river have been seen as the main symbols, features, that help develop such themes as avarice, predation, death and rebirth, the quest for identity and pride. To these images and ideas, we may add what Monroe Engel calls the &#x27;social themes of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;—having to do with money-dust, and relatedly with the treatment of the poor, education, representative government, even the inheritance laws.&#x27;&quot;

According to Metz, many of the prominent themes in Dickens&#x27;s earlier works of fiction are intricately woven into Dickens&#x27;s last novel. She states, &quot;Like &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; is about the relationship between work and the realization of self, about the necessity to be &#x27;useful&#x27; before one can be &#x27;happy.&#x27; Like &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, it is about the power of money to corrupt those who place their faith in its absolute value. Like &quot;Bleak House&quot;, it is about the legal, bureaucratic, and social barriers that intervene between individuals and their nearest neighbours. Like all of Dickens&#x27;s novels, and especially the later ones, it is about pervasive social problems—poverty, disease, class bitterness, the sheer ugliness and vacuity of contemporary life.&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
===Contemporary critics of Dickens===
At the time of its original serial publication, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; was not regarded as one of Dickens&#x27;s greatest successes, and on average fewer than 30,000 copies of each instalment was sold. Though &quot;The New York Times&quot;, of 22 November 1865, conjectured, &quot;By most readers ... the last work by Dickens will be considered his best,&quot; direct evidence of how readers responded to Dickens&#x27;s novels is scarce. Because Dickens burned his letters, the voices of his nineteenth-century serial audiences remain elusive. Thus, evidence of the reactions of his Victorian era readers must be obtained from reviews of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; by Dickens&#x27;s contemporaries.

The first British periodical to print a review of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, published 30 April 1864 in &quot;The London Review&quot;, extolled the first serial instalment, stating, &quot;Few literary pleasures are greater than that which we derive from opening the first number of one of Mr Dickens&#x27;s stories&quot; and &quot;&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; opens well&quot;.

In 1866 George Stott found the novel flawed: &quot;Mr Dickens must stand or fall by the severest canons of literary criticism: it would be an insult to his acknowledged rank to apply a more lenient standard; and bad art is not the less bad art and a failure because associated, as it is in his case, with much that is excellent, and not a little that is even fascinating.&quot;

Dickens had his fans and detractors just like every author throughout the ages, but not even his most strident supporters like E. S. Dallas felt that &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; was perfect. Rather, the oft acknowledged &quot;genius&quot; of Dickens seems to have overshadowed all reviews and made it impossible for most critics to completely condemn the work, the majority of these reviews being a mixture of praise and disparagement.

In November 1865 E. S. Dallas, in &quot;The Times&quot;, lauded &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; as &quot;one of the best of even Dickens&#x27;s tales,&quot; but was unable to ignore the flaws. &quot;This last novel of Mr Charles Dickens, really one of his finest works, and one in which on occasion he even surpasses himself, labours under the disadvantage of a beginning that drags ... On the whole, however, at that early stage the reader was more perplexed than pleased. There was an appearance of great effort without corresponding result. We were introduced to a set of people in whom it is impossible to take an interest, and were made familiar with transactions that suggested horror. The great master of fiction exhibited all his skill, performed the most wonderful feats of language, loaded his page with wit and many a fine touch peculiar to himself. The agility of his pen was amazing, but still at first we were not much amused.&quot; Despite the mixed review, it pleased Dickens so well that he gave Dallas the manuscript.

====Plot====
Many critics found fault with the plot, and in 1865, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as an &quot;involved plot combined with an entire absence of the skill to manage and unfold it&quot;. In the &quot;London Review&quot;, in the same year, an anonymous critic felt that &quot;the whole plot in which the deceased Harmon, Boffin, Wegg, and John Rokesmith, are concerned, is wild and fantastic, wanting in reality, and leading to a degree of confusion which is not compensated by any additional interest in the story&quot; and he also found that &quot;the final explanation is a disappointment.&quot; However, the &quot;London Review&quot; also thought, that &quot;the mental state of a man about to commit the greatest of crimes has seldom been depicted with such elaboration and apparent truthfulness.&quot;

====Characters====
Many reviewers responded negatively to the characters in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;. The 1865 review by Henry James in &quot;The Nation&quot; described every character as &quot;a mere bundle of eccentricities, animated by no principle of nature whatever&quot;, and condemned Dickens for a lack of characters who represent &quot;sound humanity&quot;. James maintained that none of the characters add anything to the reader&#x27;s understanding of human nature, and asserted that the characters in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, were &quot;grotesque creatures&quot;, who did not represent actual existing Victorian types.

Like James, the 1869 article &quot;Table Talk&quot; in &quot;Once a Week&quot; did not view the characters in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; as realistic. The article asks: &quot;Do men live by finding the bodies of the drowned, and landing them ashore &#x27;with their pockets allus inside out&#x27; for the sake of the reward offered for their recovery? As far as we can make out, no. We have been at some trouble to inquire from men who should know; watermen, who have lived on the river nigh all their lives, if they have seen late at night a dark boat with a solitary occupant, drifting down the river on the &#x27;look out,&#x27; plying his frightful trade? The answer has uniformly been &#x27;No, we have never seen such men,&#x27; and more, they do not believe in their existence.&quot;

The reviewer in the &quot;London Review&quot; in 1865 denounced the characters of Wegg and Venus, &quot;who appear to us in all the highest degree unnatural—the one being a mere phantasm, and the other a nonentity.&quot; However he applauded the creation of Bella Wilfer: &quot;Probably the greatest favourite in the book will be—or rather is already—Bella Wilfer. She is evidently a pet of the author&#x27;s, and she will long remain the darling of half the households of England and America.&quot; E. S. Dallas, in his 1865 review, concurred that &quot;Mr Dickens has never done anything in the portraiture of women so pretty and so perfect&quot; as Bella.

Dallas also admired the creation of Jenny Wren—who was greeted with contempt by Henry James—stating that, &quot;The dolls&#x27; dressmaker is one of his most charming pictures, and Mr Dickens tells her strange story with a mixture of humour and pathos which it is impossible to resist.&quot;

In an 1867 &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; article entitled &quot;The Genius of Dickens&quot;, critic Edwin Percy Whipple declared that Dickens&#x27;s characters &quot;have a strange attraction to the mind, and are objects of love or hatred, like actual men and women.&quot;

====Pathos and sentiment====
In October 1865 an unsigned review appeared in the &quot;London Review&quot; stating that &quot;Mr Dickens stands in need of no allowance on the score of having out-written himself. His fancy, his pathos, his humour, his wonderful powers of observation, his picturesqueness, and his versatility, are as remarkable now as they were twenty years ago.&quot; But like other critics, after praising the book this same critic then turned around and disparaged it: &quot;Not that we mean to say Mr Dickens has outgrown his faults. They are as obvious as ever—sometimes even trying our patience rather hard. A certain extravagance in particular scenes and persons—a tendency to caricature and grotesqueness—and a something here and there which savours of the melodramatic, as if the author had been considering how the thing would &#x27;tell&#x27; on the stage—are to be found in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, as in all this great novelist&#x27;s productions.&quot;

Edwin Whipple in 1867 also commented on the sentiment and pathos of Dickens&#x27;s characters, stating, &quot;But the poetical, the humorous, the tragic, or the pathetic element is never absent in Dickens&#x27;s characterization, to make his delineations captivating to the heart and imagination, and give the reader a sense of having escaped from whatever in the actual world is dull and wearisome.&quot;

However, in 1869 George Stott condemned Dickens for being overly sentimental: &quot;Mr Dickens&#x27;s pathos we can only regard as a complete and absolute failure. It is unnatural and unlovely. He attempts to make a stilted phraseology, and weak and sickly sentimentality do duty for genuine emotion.&quot; Still, in the manner of all the other mixed reviews, Stott states that &quot;we still hold him to be emphatically a man of genius.&quot;

The &quot;Spectator&quot; in 1869 concurred with Stott&#x27;s opinion, writing &quot;Mr Dickens has brought people to think that there is a sort of piety in being gushing and maudlin,&quot; and that his works are heavily imbued with the &quot;most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism&quot;, but the unsigned critic still maintained that Dickens was one of the great authors of his time.

===Later literary criticism===
G. K. Chesterton, one of Dickens&#x27;s critics in the early 20th century, expressed the opinion that Mr Boffin&#x27;s pretended fall into miserliness was originally intended by Dickens to be authentic, but that Dickens ran out of time and so took refuge in the awkward pretence that Boffin had been acting. Chesterton argues that while we might believe Boffin could be corrupted, we can hardly believe he could keep up such a strenuous pretence of corruption: &quot;Such a character as his—rough, simple and lumberingly unconscious—might be more easily conceived as really sinking in self-respect and honour than as keeping up, month after month, so strained and inhuman a theatrical performance. ... It might have taken years to turn Noddy Boffin into a miser; but it would have taken centuries to turn him into an actor.&quot; However, Chesterton also praised the book as being a return to Dickens&#x27;s youthful optimism and creative exuberance, full of characters who &quot;have that great Dickens quality of being something which is pure farce and yet which is not superficial; an unfathomable farce—a farce that goes down to the roots of the universe.&quot;

In his 1940 article &quot;Dickens: Two Scrooges&quot;, Edmund Wilson states, &quot;&quot;Our Mutual Friend,&quot; like all these later books of Dickens, is more interesting to us today than it was to Dickens&#x27;s public. Certainly the subtleties and profundities that are now discovered in it were not noticed by the reviewers.&quot; As a whole, modern critics of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, particularly those of the last half century, have been more appreciative of Dickens&#x27;s last completed work than his contemporary reviewers. Although some modern critics find Dickens&#x27;s characterisation in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; problematic, most tend to positively acknowledge the novel&#x27;s complexity and appreciate its multiple plot lines.

In November 2019, BBC Arts included &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

====Form and plot====
In his 2006 article &quot;The Richness of Redundancy: &quot;Our Mutual Friend,&quot; John R. Reed states, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; has not pleased many otherwise satisfied readers of Dickens&#x27;s fiction. For his contemporaries and such acute assessors of fiction as Henry James, the novel seemed to lack structure, among other faults. More recently, critics have discovered ways in which Dickens can be seen experimenting in the novel.&quot; Reed maintains that Dickens&#x27;s establishment of &quot;an incredibly elaborate structure&quot; for &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; was an extension of Dickens&#x27;s quarrel with realism. In creating a highly formal structure for his novel, which called attention to the novel&#x27;s own language, Dickens embraced taboos of realism. Reed also argues that Dickens&#x27;s employment of his characteristic technique of offering his reader what might be seen as a surplus of information within the novel, in the form of a pattern of references, exists as a way for Dickens to guarantee that the meaning of his novel might be transmitted to his reader. Reed cites Dickens&#x27;s multiple descriptions of the River Thames and repetitive likening of Gaffer to &quot;a roused bird of prey&quot; in the novel&#x27;s first chapter as evidence of Dickens&#x27;s use of redundancy to establish two of the novel&#x27;s fundamental themes: preying/scavenging and the transformative powers of water. According to Reed, to notice and interpret the clues representing the novel&#x27;s central themes that Dickens gives his reader, the reader must have a surplus of these clues. Echoing Reed&#x27;s sentiments, in her 1979 article &quot;The Artistic Reclamation of Waste in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;,&quot; Nancy Aycock Metz claims, &quot;The reader is thrown back upon his own resources. He must suffer, along with the characters of the novel, from the climate of chaos and confusion, and like them, he must begin to make connections and impose order on the details he observes.&quot;

In his 1995 article &quot;The Cup and the Lip and the Riddle of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;&quot;, Gregg A. Hecimovich reaffirms Metz&#x27;s notion of reading the novel as a process of connection and focuses on what he sees as one of the main aspects of Dickens&#x27;s narrative: &quot;a complex working out of the mysteries and idiosyncrasies presented in the novel.&quot; Unlike Dickens&#x27;s contemporary critics, Hecimovich commends Dickens for &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;&#x27;s disjunctive, riddle-like structure and manipulation of plots, declaring, &quot;In a tale about conundrums and questions of identity, divergence of plots is desirable.&quot; Hecimovich goes on to say that in structuring his last novel as a riddle-game, Dickens challenges conventions of nineteenth-century Victorian England and that the &quot;sickness&quot; infecting Dickens&#x27;s composition of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; is that of Victorian society generally, not Dickens himself.

====Characters====
Harland S. Nelson&#x27;s 1973 article &quot;Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and Henry Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot;&quot; examines Dickens&#x27;s inspiration for two of the novel&#x27;s working class characters. Nelson asserts that Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden were potentially modelled after real members of London&#x27;s working class whom Mayhew interviewed in the 1840s for his nonfiction work &quot;London Labour and the London Poor.&quot; Unlike some of Dickens&#x27;s contemporaries, who regarded the characters in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; as unrealistic representations of actual Victorian people, Nelson maintains that London&#x27;s nineteenth-century working class is authentically depicted through characters such as Gaffer Hexam and Betty Higden.

While novelist Henry James dismissed the minor characters Jenny Wren, Mr Wegg, and Mr Venus as &quot;pathetic characters&quot; in his 1865 review of the novel, Gregg Hecimovich in 1989 refers to them as &quot;important riddlers and riddlees.&quot; Hecimovich suggests that, &quot;Through the example of his minor characters, Dickens directs his readers to seek, with the chief characters, order and structure out of the apparent disjunctive &#x27;rubbish&#x27; in the novel, to analyze and articulate what ails a fallen London ... Only then can the reader, mimicking the action of certain characters, create something &#x27;harmonious&#x27; and beautiful out of the fractured waste land.&quot;

Some modern critics of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; have been overall more critical of the novel&#x27;s characters. In her 1970 essay &quot;&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;: Dickens as the Compleat Angler,&quot; Annabel Patterson declares, &quot;&quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; is not a book which satisfies all of Dickens&#x27;s admirers. Those who appreciate Dickens mainly for the exuberance of his characterization and his gift for caricature feel a certain flatness in this last novel&quot;. Deirdre David claims that &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; is a novel through which Dickens &quot;engaged in a fictive improvement of society&quot; that bore little relation to reality, especially regarding the character of Lizzie Hexam, whom David describes as a myth of purity among the desperate lower-classes. David criticises Dickens for his &quot;fable of regenerated bourgeois culture&quot; and maintains that the character Eugene Wrayburn&#x27;s realistic counterpart would have been far more likely to offer Lizzie money for sex than to offer her money for education.

<doc id="664283" wikidata="Q7848807" url="?curid=664283" title="Tryptophan repressor">
<text>Tryptophan repressor (or trp repressor) is a transcription factor involved in controlling amino acid metabolism. It has been best studied in &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, where it is a dimeric protein that regulates transcription of the 5 genes in the tryptophan operon. When the amino acid tryptophan is plentiful in the cell, it binds to the protein, which causes a conformational change in the protein. The repressor complex then binds to its operator sequence in the genes it regulates, shutting off the genes.

One of the genes regulated by trp repressor, trpR, codes for the tryptophan repressor protein itself. This is a form of feedback regulation. However, these genes are located on different operons.

The (tryptophan) repressor is a 25 kD protein homodimer which regulates transcription of the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in bacteria. There are 5 operons which are regulated by trpR: the &quot;trpEDCBA&quot;, &quot;trpR&quot;, &quot;AroH&quot;, &quot;AroL&quot;, and &quot;mtr&quot; operons.

==Mechanism==
When the amino acid tryptophan is in plentiful supply in the cell, trpR binds 2 molecules of tryptophan, which alters its structure and dynamics so that it becomes able to bind to operator DNA. When this occurs, transcription of the DNA is prevented, suppressing the products of the gene - proteins which make more tryptophan. When the cellular levels of tryptophan decline, the tryptophan molecules on the repressor fall off, allowing the repressor to return to its inactive form.

trpR also controls the regulation of its own production, through regulation of the &quot;trpR&quot; gene.

The structure of the ligand-bound holorepressor, and the ligand-free forms have been determined by both X-ray crystallography and NMR.

The trp operon consists of a regulatory gene, a promoter, an operator, and a terminator. The trp operon is active only when cellular tryptophan is scarce. If there isn&#x27;t enough tryptophan, the repressor protein breaks off from the operator (where the repressor is normally bound) and RNA polymerase can complete its reading of the strand of DNA. If the RNA polymerase reaches the terminator (at the end of the DNA strand), the enzymes for tryptophan biosynthesis are expressed.

<doc id="664288" wikidata="Q5547352" url="?curid=664288" title="Georgia Avenue–Petworth station">
<text>Georgia Avenue–Petworth station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green Line. It is located at the border of the neighborhoods of Petworth, Sixteenth Street Heights, and Park View in Northwest.

==History==
It opened on September 18, 1999, part of an extension of the Green Line that connected and , allowing trains to travel between and .

The station&#x27;s west entrance closed on December 11, 2006, to accommodate construction of a mixed-use development. Bus stops, bike racks, and lockers were moved, and the entrance remained closed until 2009, a year later than planned.

Like many other Metro stations, Georgia Avenue–Petworth has catalyzed nearby development. The District of Columbia Office of Planning has divided development proposals near the station into four localities:
* Park View. Composed of three blocks along Georgia Avenue south of the station—3200 West, 3400 East, and 3500 East—Park View development is mainly limited by a height limit to infill residential or four- to six-story mixed-use development.
* Pleasant Plains. Further south, sites at 2700 West and 2900 West on Georgia Avenue are also subject to the low height restriction but with more emphasis on apartments and row houses.
* Petworth-Metro. To the north, this is the largest neighborhood by sites available and height, with a restriction of . It contains a series of blocks on Georgia Avenue from Princeton Place to Shepherd Street, with the 3700 West block already developed as Park Place, containing 148 condos and of street-level retail space.
* Upshur. The northernmost of the four regions, it is centered on Upshur Street near Kansas Avenue. As with Pleasant Plains, the Planning Office has focused on residential development for Upshur.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from Greenbelt to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

==Station layout==
The station has an island platform located below New Hampshire Avenue, with street-level access from the intersection with Georgia Avenue. It also features the &quot;Arch II&quot; design found at Columbia Heights, Congress Heights, Glenmont, and Mount Vernon Square.

<text>Book the First: The Bad Beginning is the first novel of the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. The novel tells the story of three children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire, who become orphans following a fire and are sent to live with Count Olaf, who attempts to steal their inheritance.

The book was published on September 30, 1999, by Scholastic Inc. and illustrated by Brett Helquist. An audiobook was released in 2003 with narration by Tim Curry, several special editions of the book have been made and the book has been translated into many different languages. There is a film based on the series starring Jim Carrey and a Netflix TV series starring Neil Patrick Harris.

==Synopsis==
Violet Baudelaire is fourteen years old and loves creating amazing inventions; Klaus Baudelaire is twelve and an obsessive reader; Sunny Baudelaire is a baby and has four surprisingly large and sharp buck teeth, with which she loves to bite. While they are at Briny Beach, the banker Mr. Poe tells them that their parents have died in a fire that destroyed their home. He places them in the care of Count Olaf, said to be a distant relative although the children have never heard of him before. Olaf&#x27;s ramshackle house is filthy and covered in disconcerting eye images; it has a tower which the Baudelaires are forbidden from entering. Count Olaf is unpleasant, easily angered, and forces the children to perform odious chores. It becomes clear that Count Olaf is scheming to collect the Baudelaires&#x27; fortune. The only solace the children find is spending time with their neighbor, Justice Strauss. 

For the next few days, Olaf keeps the Baudelaires busy by forcing them to clean his house. The Baudelaires disagree but do not dare to object. One day, the Baudelaires are set the task of making dinner for Olaf and his theatre troupe. The troupe contains two white faced women, a hook-handed man, a bald man with a long nose and a person of indeterminate gender. The siblings make puttanesca, but when Olaf arrives, he demands roast beef. The children remind him that he never asked them to make roast beef, and Olaf becomes angry, lifting Sunny into the air, and striking Klaus across the face after Klaus tells everyone Count Olaf has given them only one bed and a pile of rocks for the three of them to sleep on and to play with.

After a few days, Olaf forces the Baudelaires to participate in a play written by &quot;Al Funcoot&quot; called &quot;The Marvelous Marriage.&quot;, forcing Violet to play the role of his bride. After smuggling a book from Strauss&#x27;s library, Klaus realises that the marriage in the play will be legally binding, meaning Olaf will gain control of their fortune. He confronts Olaf, who has one of his associates put Sunny in a birdcage, dangling from outside the window of his tower. He threatens to kill her if Klaus and Violet do not follow his plan. Violet constructs a makeshift grappling hook and uses it to climb the tower. She finds the hook-handed man (a member of Olaf&#x27;s theatre troupe) waiting to capture her. Klaus is brought up to the tower and they are locked together in the room until the play begins.

After Violet signs the marriage document, Olaf interrupts to tell the audience that their wedding was legally binding. Justice Strauss and Mr. Poe both object, but concede that the law requires them to hand over the Baudelaire fortune to Olaf. Violet interrupts to proclaim that the marriage was not legally binding, as she signed with her left hand despite being right-handed and the wording is &#x27;own hand&#x27;. Justice Strauss agrees that this invalidates the marriage. Before Olaf can be arrested for locking up Sunny, one of his associates turns the lights in the theatre off and he is able to escape. Justice Strauss tells the Baudelaires that she is willing to adopt them; however, Mr. Poe says that this would go against their parents&#x27; will, as Justice Strauss is not their relative. He takes them back to his household until he can find another guardian for them.

==Critical reception==
In 2012, &quot;School Library Journal&quot; named &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; the 48th best children&#x27;s novel. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; noted the uncomfortably macabre tone of the novel, warning that because &quot;the Baudelaire children are truly sympathetic characters&quot;, the novel is &quot;not for the squeamish&quot;. Catherine Pelosi of &quot;Kids&#x27; Book Review&quot; responded positively to &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot;, describing it as &quot;exciting, humorous and appropriately dark&quot;.

==Special editions==

===&quot;The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition&quot;===
&quot;The Bad Beginning: Rare Edition&quot; () was published by HarperCollins on September 23, 2003. In addition to a box, new cover, and additional illustrations, this edition contains a fourteenth chapter filled with author&#x27;s notes, many of which foreshadow later events in the series or provide excessively detailed information about the events in &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; itself.

===&quot;The Bad Beginning; or, Orphans!&quot;===
&quot;The Bad Beginning; or, Orphans!&quot; is a paperback edition of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; designed to mimic a Victorian penny dreadful. It was released on May 8, 2007. The book features a new full-color cover, seven new illustrations, and the first part of a serial supplement entitled &quot;The Cornucopian Cavalcade&quot;, which in this edition includes the first of 13-part comic entitled &quot;The Spoily Brats&quot; along with a page of Victorian-era false advertisements, both produced by Michael Kupperman; an advice column written by Lemony Snicket along with a page listing every entry in &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; (some of which are fictional); the first part of a story entitled &quot;Q: A Psychic pstory of the psupernatural&quot; by Stephen Leacock.

===Other special editions===
Two more editions of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; were published by Egmont Publishing on October 1, 2003—&quot;The Bad Beginning: Special Edition&quot; () and &quot;The Bad Beginning: Limited Edition&quot; (). They come in a larger format and contain three plates of color artwork that are redrawn from the original edition of the book and two plates of new color artwork. The &quot;Limited Edition&quot; is bound in leather and contained within a box, similar to the &quot;Rare Edition&quot;, and each copy was signed by Daniel Handler. There is also a new &quot;Short-Lived Edition&quot;, released for general sale on June 14, 2012.

==Audiobook==
Two audiobook versions of this novel were released. The first version was released in September 2003. It was read by Tim Curry and featured Daniel Handler, under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket, who read a portion, &quot;A Conversation Between the Author and Leonard S. Marcus&quot;, which won an &quot;Earphones Award&quot; on &quot;AudioFile&quot;, which described the audiobook as &quot;fabulously funny&quot; and complimented the conversation involving Handler.

The second version was released in October 2004, after the release of the film, &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. This multi-voice cast audio book was narrated by Tim Curry and featured Jim Carrey, Meryl Streep, and Jude Law. This version also included sound effects and a soundtrack. This edition of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; was an Audie Awards finalist for Children&#x27;s Titles for Ages 8+ in 2005, and a Grammy Award Nominee for Best Spoken Word Album for Children in 2005. &quot;AudioFile&quot; gave the audiobook a positive review, although stated that &quot;the cast of seven at first sound self-consciously formal until one realizes that the acting is supposed to be as mannered as the clever writing&quot;.

The book was adapted into the first two episodes of the first season of the television series adaptation produced by Netflix.

===Film===
Elements of &quot;The Bad Beginning&quot; were featured in the 2004 film adaptation of the first three books in the series, &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;.

<text>Book the Second: The Reptile Room is the second book in the children&#x27;s series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;, written by Daniel Handler under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket. The book tells the story of the Baudelaire orphans, as they are sent to live with a distant relative named Montgomery Montgomery.

==Plot==
The three Baudelaire orphans have been placed under the care of their distant relative, herpetologist Dr. Montgomery Montgomery. &quot;Uncle Monty&quot;, as he prefers to be called, is a short, chubby man with a round, red face. The children immediately like him. He lets them each choose their own bedroom and informs them that they are going to accompany him on a trip to Peru to study snakes.

The children are fascinated by the many snakes in the &quot;Reptile Room&quot;, a giant hall in which their Uncle Monty&#x27;s reptile collection is stored. They meet the Incredibly Deadly Viper, which Uncle Monty recently discovered, whose name is actually a misnomer to its harmless and friendly nature. The three children are each given jobs in the Reptile Room: Violet is given the job of inventing traps for new snakes found in Peru, Klaus is told to read books on snakes to help advise Uncle Monty, and Sunny&#x27;s job is to bite ropes into usable pieces.

When Stephano, the successor of the original assistant Gustav arrives, the children realize immediately that he is their recurring nemesis, Count Olaf, who was onto their family fortune. They try to warn Uncle Monty. They manage to talk to Monty alone the day before their trip to Peru, but Monty is instead convinced that Stephano is a spy trying to steal information from his research and fails to understand their claims that Stephano is Olaf. He tears up Stephano&#x27;s ticket to Peru. The following morning, the Baudelaires discover Monty&#x27;s dead body.

Stephano still tries to take the children to Peru. However, as they are leaving the estate, Stephano&#x27;s car crashes into Mr. Poe&#x27;s car. They return to the house, where Poe and Stephano discuss what to do with the children. Mr. Poe refuses to believe the children when they say Stephano is Count Olaf in disguise, as Stephano lacks a tattoo of an eye on his ankle. Dr. Lucafont arrives and performs an autopsy, claiming Monty was killed by the Mamba du Mal.

Violet tells her siblings to cause a distraction; the Incredibly Deadly Viper pretends to attack Sunny, while Violet creates a lockpick from the power plug of Klaus&#x27; reading lamp. She then uses it to open Count Olaf&#x27;s suitcase to reveal needles with the venom from a snake as well as some powder that he used to cover up the eye tattoo. Klaus reveals to Mr. Poe, Dr. Lucafont and Count Olaf that, from his studies of the Mamba du Mal, if the Mamba du Mal attacked Uncle Monty he would be bruised, while Monty was pale. Violet shows her evidence, and Mr. Poe rubs away the powder on Stephano&#x27;s ankle to reveal the eye tattoo, proving Stephano was Olaf. However, Olaf manages to escape when Dr. Lucafont (the hook-handed man in disguise) helps him get away, leaving Mr. Poe to take the orphans to a new home.

== Foreshadowing ==
In the final picture, one of the men is wearing a shirt that reads Lachrymose Leeches, which is a hint to the next book: &quot;The Wide Window&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said Snicket &quot;uses formal, Latinate language and intrusive commentary to hilarious effect&quot; and complimented Helquist&#x27;s &quot;exquisitely detailed drawings of Gothic gargoyles and mischievous eyes&quot;, which were said to &quot;echo the contents of this elegantly designed hardcover&quot;.

==Other editions==

===Audiobook===
The audiobook version of &quot;The Reptile Room&quot; was read by Tim Curry. A review at AudioFile gave the audiobook an &quot;Earphones Award&quot;, calling it &quot;fabulously funny&quot; and complimenting Curry&#x27;s &quot;enormous talents&quot;.

===The Reptile Room; or, Murder!===
&quot;The Reptile Room; or, Murder!&quot; is a paperback rerelease of &quot;The Reptile Room&quot;, designed to mimic Victorian penny dreadfuls. It was released on May 8, 2007. The book features a new full-colour cover, seven new illustrations, and the second part of a serial supplement entitled &quot;The Cornucopian Cavalcade&quot;, which includes the second part of a 13-part comic by Michael Kupperman entitled &quot;The Spoily Brats&quot;, an advice column written by Lemony Snicket, and the second part of a story by Stephen Leacock entitled &quot;A Psychic Pstory of the Psupernatural&quot;, along with other novelty additions.

<text>Book the Third: The Wide Window is the third novel of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. In this novel, the Baudelaire orphans live with their aunt Josephine, who is seemingly scared of everything. The book was published on February 25, 2000 by HarperCollins and illustrated by Brett Helquist.

==Plot==

Mr. Poe puts the Baudelaire orphans, Klaus Baudelaire, Sunny Baudelaire and Violet Baudelaire under the care of Aunt Josephine, who lives in a house atop a hill overlooking Lake Lachrymose, a lake so large that hurricanes have occurred in that area. Aunt Josephine is afraid of everything from cooking food (as the stove might explode) to her welcome mat. She loves grammar, and her library is filled with books about the grammar of the English language 

While helping Aunt Josephine in the grocery store, Violet runs into a sailor named &quot;Captain Sham&quot;, who she concludes is Count Olaf in disguise. Aunt Josephine declines to believe this due to Captain Sham&#x27;s charming personality. That night, the children hear a crash and find out that their new guardian had jumped out of the Wide Window that overlooks Lake Lachrymose, and that before doing so left a note for them informing them that Captain Sham will be their new guardian.

Mr. Poe refuses to believe the children&#x27;s claim the note was a lie by Count Olaf and takes them to dinner with him at the Anxious Clown, a cheap and grimy restaurant with an over-enthusiastic waiter. Needing a distraction to come up with a strategy, Violet puts peppermints in her own food and that of Klaus and Sunny. Allergic, they break into hives, forcing Count Olaf to allow them to return to their aunt&#x27;s house. Klaus shows them that, though the note is in Aunt Josephine&#x27;s handwriting, the message &#x27;Curdled Cave&#x27; is encoded by grammar errors. As they finish decoding the note, Hurricane Herman hits and the house begins to fall apart into the lake.

As the hurricane rages, the Baudelaire orphans plan to get to Curdled Cave by stealing a boat from Captain Sham&#x27;s boat store near Lake Lachrymose. There, they encounter one of Count Olaf&#x27;s henchpeople, a large person of undetermined gender. They endure the storm and reach the Curdled Cave, where Aunt Josephine reveals that Count Olaf forced her to write the note and that he broke the Wide Window, causing the Baudelaires to believe that she had committed suicide.

While traveling back, Lachrymose leeches attempt to suck their blood; the leeches smelled food in Aunt Josephine&#x27;s stomach, as she ate a banana under the one hour limit. They signal for help, only for Count Olaf to arrive on a ship. After leaving Aunt Josephine to be eaten by the leeches, Olaf brings the children back to the house, where Sunny reveals Olaf&#x27;s ruse to Mr. Poe by biting Count Olaf&#x27;s fake wooden peg in half, revealing his eye tattoo. He and his henchperson lock the Baudelaire Orphans and Mr. Poe in the gate of Captain Sham&#x27;s boat rental and escape, leaving Mr. Poe to once again find a home for the orphans.

==Foreshadowing==
On the side of a building in the picture hangs a sign in the shape of a pair of glasses with a pair of squinting eyes, referencing Dr. Orwell&#x27;s office in &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot;.

*The name Damocles Dock presumably alludes to the legendary Greek figure Damocles who had a sword dangling over his head. The picture at the beginning of the book shows the three Baudelaires standing on Damocles Dock. In the archway at the entrance to the dock is a sword dangling over their heads.
*In the previous book of the series, the endnote references the Café Kafka, a reference to the Austrian-Hungarian author Franz Kafka. One of Kafka&#x27;s short stories, &quot;Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk&quot;, features Josephine, the only mouse that can sing. In the short story, Josephine&#x27;s music sounds like whistling if heard from the wrong angle, which may be a reference to Aunt Josephine&#x27;s late husband&#x27;s ability to whistle with crackers in his mouth (along with the Baudelaire orphans&#x27; mother). Josephine&#x27;s last name was Anwhistle, making her husband Ike Anwhistle (&quot;I can whistle&quot;).
*Lachrymose (Lake Lachrymose) means &quot;given to or causing tears&quot;.

<text>Book the Fourth: The Miserable Mill is the fourth novel of the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. In this novel, the Baudelaire orphans live with the owner of Lucky Smells Lumber Mill. The book was published on April 15, 2000, by HarperCollins and illustrated by Brett Helquist.

==Plot summary==
Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire are traveling on a train heading for Paltryville, the location of the children&#x27;s new home, the Lucky Smells Lumbermill.

Upon arrival, the children learn that they will have to work at the mill, but as part of the deal, their new guardian, Sir (whose name is impossible to pronounce otherwise), will try to keep Count Olaf, their nemesis, away. They meet Sir&#x27;s more sympathetic partner, Charles, who shows them the library, which contains three books, one about the history of the lumbermill, one about the town constitution, and one donated by Dr. Georgina Orwell, the local optometrist, who lives in an eye-shaped building, which also resembles, suspiciously, the tattoo of an eye on their nemesis Count Olaf&#x27;s ankle.

Klaus breaks his own glasses when he is purposely tripped by the new foreman, Flacutono, and is sent to see Dr. Orwell. When Klaus returns from the optometrist, hours later, he acts strangely, as if in a trance. The next day in the lumbermill, Flacutono instructs Klaus to operate a stamping machine. Klaus causes an accident by dropping the machine on Phil, an optimistic coworker. Flacutono exclaims that the machine &quot;cost an inordinate amount of money&quot;. The other workers ask what the unfamiliar word means and Klaus defines the word. Klaus explains that he doesn&#x27;t remember what happened between when he broke his glasses and waking up in the mill. Foreman Flacutono trips him again, once again causing his glasses to break. This time though, Violet and Sunny accompany Klaus to Dr. Orwell&#x27;s office.

Together, they arrive at the eye-shaped building they saw on their arrival to Lucky Smells. Dr. Orwell, seemingly friendly, lets them in, and tells Violet and Sunny to sit in the waiting room. Violet and Sunny realize that Count Olaf is disguised as Shirley, a receptionist and that Klaus has been (and is being) hypnotized by Orwell, who is in cahoots with Olaf. They leave with Klaus, who is once again in a trance and calls Violet &quot;Veronica.&quot; When they return to the mill, they find a memo from Sir informing them that if there is another accident, he&#x27;ll place them under Shirley&#x27;s care.

Violet and Sunny put Klaus to bed and go to the mill&#x27;s library. Violet reads the book donated by Orwell, a difficult task given her limited vocabulary and the book&#x27;s usage of difficult words. She learns that Orwell&#x27;s technique uses a command word to control the subject and an &quot;unhypnotize&quot; word. They then hear the lumbermill starting early and rush to see what is happening. They find Charles strapped to a log which Klaus is pushing through a buzz saw as Flacutono gives orders. The girls notice Klaus&#x27; bare feet, a clue that he has been hypnotized out of bed yet again. Shirley and Orwell arrive, and the latter orders Klaus to ignore his sisters. Violet realizes the release word (&quot;inordinate&quot;) just in time. Violet is caught by Shirley and Flacutono, and Klaus manages to free Charles by trying to invent a fishing rod. Sunny and Orwell duel, with Orwell wielding a sword and Sunny bearing only her teeth. Sir enters the room, surprising Orwell and causing her to step backwards into path of the buzz saw, killing her.

Count Olaf is locked in the library, but he escapes from the window along with Foreman Flacutono, who is revealed to be the bald man with the long nose in disguise. Sir relinquishes the Baudelaires, leaving them without care again.

==Foreshadowing==
The last picture of &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot; shows Sir watching Olaf and his henchman escaping, while two students (a boy and a girl) prepare to board a school bus. This is a reference to Duncan and Isadora Quagmire, and the events of the next book: &quot;The Austere Academy&quot;.

==References in book==
The name Georgina Orwell is most likely a reference to George Orwell, famed for his novels (prominently amongst them &quot;1984&quot;, to which there are several other references in the series).

==Adaptations==
The book was adapted into the seventh and eighth episodes of the first season of the television series adaptation produced by Netflix. The episodes mirror the book&#x27;s plot relatively closely, with some scenes and characters changed, such as &quot;Flacutono&quot; being the Hook-Handed Man in the TV series as opposed to the Bald Man in the book. The sword fight between Dr. Orwell and Sunny is removed, and as a result, Dr. Orwell dies by being thrown into the furnace instead of being cut in half by the buzzsaw. Additionally, there are major differences as to the fate of the mill and the town; the town was not burned down in the book, and the other staff were not hypnotized.

<text>Book the Fifth: The Austere Academy is the fifth novel in the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. The Baudelaire orphans are sent to a boarding school, overseen by monstrous employees. There, the orphans meet new friends, new enemies, and Count Olaf in disguises.

It was published in 2000 in the US, and 2001 in the UK.

==Plot summary==
Mr. Poe takes the Baudelaire children (Violet, Klaus and Sunny) to Prufrock Preparatory School, a boarding school they are to attend. They are greeted by a rude girl, Carmelita Spats, who calls the children &quot;cakesniffers&quot;. Vice Principal Nero tells them about the school&#x27;s odd rules: They are to sleep in a crab-infested, fungus-dripping shack because they have no living guardian to sign a permission slip for them. Sunny will work as Nero&#x27;s administrative assistant. They must attend Nero&#x27;s nightly terrible violin concerts. Punishments for breaking these rules include being made to eat in the cafeteria with no silverware or hands tied behind one&#x27;s back and having to purchase candy for Nero and watch him eat it. Sunny will have her silverware removed permanently for working in the administrative building, in which children are not allowed.

At lunch, Carmelita mocks the Baudelaires, but Duncan and Isadora Quagmire stand up for them. The Quagmires are triplets, and they say that their parents died in a fire that also killed their sibling Quigley. When they become adults, they will inherit a fortune of sapphires. Isadora writes rhyming couplets, while Duncan is passionate about journalism and research. Over the following days, Violet is a student of Mr. Remora, and must take detailed notes on his boring anecdotes, while Klaus is taught by Mrs. Bass, who makes her students endlessly measure the metric dimensions of objects. Isadora is in Klaus&#x27; class and Duncan is in Violet&#x27;s. Sunny struggles to carry out her administrative work, which is intended for an adult. The school has no weekend breaks.

Count Olaf soon arrives, disguised as the new gym teacher Coach Genghis. Nero fails to recognize him, or to take the children seriously when they raise concerns. Carmelita delivers a message to the Baudelaires that they are to meet Genghis after dinner. He makes them paint a large, luminous circle on the lawn and run laps around it all night. He calls this &quot;Special Orphan Running Exercises&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.O.R.E.&quot; The children pretend not to recognize Olaf. After nine consecutive nights of S.O.R.E., Violet and Klaus begin failing tests in class, Sunny fails to complete administrative work, and they begin arguing with Duncan and Isadora.

The Baudelaires meet with Nero and tell him directly that Genghis is Olaf, but he is disbelieving. He demands that Violet and Klaus pass comprehensive exams set by their teachers the following morning, while Sunny must prepare homemade staples to use on Nero&#x27;s paperwork, or they will be expelled and fired respectively, in which case Genghis will become the children&#x27;s guardian. The Baudelaires must also give Carmelita earrings for each delivered message, and present Nero with candy for missing his concerts while doing S.O.R.E.

Duncan and Isadora disguise themselves as Violet and Klaus and steal a bag of flour from the cafeteria to pose as Sunny for the S.O.R.E. exercises that night. They hope Olaf will not notice the difference in the dark. The Quagmires leave their comprehensive notebooks for Violet and Klaus to learn from, while Violet invents a staple-making technique with a crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach and a fork. Violet makes staples while Klaus reads from each notebook aloud.

After the children perform perfectly on their tests, Genghis arrives. He discovered that the Quagmires were impersonating the children after they left the bag of flour behind. As Mr. Poe arrives to give Nero and Carmelita the candy and earring, Nero expels the Baudelaires. The Baudelaires insist that Genghis remove his shoes and turban, to expose Olaf&#x27;s distinctive eye tattoo and monobrow, and he chooses instead to run away. The Baudelaires pursue, succeeding in removing his shoes and turban. They discover that two members of his troupe, the white-faced women, were cafeteria workers and that Olaf has captured the Quagmires. As Klaus and Olaf reach the car, Duncan yells at Klaus, trying to communicate information he and his sister found in the library while researching Count Olaf. Duncan throws the pair&#x27;s personal commonplace books at him and shouts out &quot;V.F.D.&quot;, but Olaf kicks Klaus and snatches the notebooks up. Olaf reaches the car before the children and drives away with the white-faced women and the Quagmire children.

==Foreshadowing==
The last picture of &quot;The Austere Academy&quot; shows the Quagmires being shoved into a car with a fish on the license plate, which is a reference to the ocean-themed décor in &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot;.

==Cultural references==

*The names Isadora and Duncan came from Isadora Duncan, a famous dancer, who was killed when her scarf was caught in a sports car&#x27;s wheels.
*Prufrock may be a reference to &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot;, a poem by T. S. Eliot.
*Vice Principal Nero is a reference to the Emperor Nero, a Roman Emperor whose reign is often associated with tyranny and greed. Emperor Nero allegedly &quot;fiddled while Rome burned.&quot; Emperor Nero was also famous for forcing many of his subjects to sit through extended theatrical pieces created and performed by himself. This is reflected in Vice Principal Nero&#x27;s awful violin recitals.
*Genghis Khan, a famous Mongolian chieftain, shares his name with Coach Genghis, Count Olaf&#x27;s disguise in this book.
*Mrs. Bass and Mr. Remora share their names with types of fish, as did the former gym teacher Miss Tench, a reference to the fact that a group of fish is called a school.
*When Isadora mentions she writes poetry, Sunny shrieks Sappho (the name of a female Greek poet).
*The book&#x27;s cover is a reference to the classic novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.
*The UK version of the book cover is completely different. It shows Carmelita Spats glaring at Violet, Klaus and Sunny while they are getting their food.

<text>Book the Sixth: The Ersatz Elevator is the sixth novel of the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. The Baudelaires are sent to live with the wealthy Esmé and Jerome Squalor.

==Plot summary==
Mr. Poe takes the Baudelaire orphans to their new home on 667 Dark Avenue. The street is dark, as light is &quot;out&quot;, or unpopular. The elevators in the apartment building are not working, as elevators are &quot;out&quot;, leaving the Baudelaires to walk up several dozen flights of stairs to the penthouse where the Squalors live. Jerome Squalor welcomes the children to their new home. He offers them &quot;aqueous martinis&quot;, (water garnished with an olive served in a fancy glass), and introduces them to his wife, Esmé Squalor, the city&#x27;s sixth most important financial adviser, who is concerned about what&#x27;s &quot;in&quot; and what&#x27;s &quot;out&quot;. Jerome avoids disputes with Esmé, as he hates arguing with her, and follows her instructions. While Jerome, a good friend of the Baudelaires&#x27; mother, truly cares for the children, it becomes apparent that Esmé&#x27;s reason for adopting them is because orphans are &quot;in.&quot; Esmé sends the children and Jerome to Café Salmonella for dinner, because she will be busy privately discussing arrangements for an auction with trendy auctioneer Gunther but they knew that it was count Olaf.

After Esmé gives the children over-sized pinstripe suits to wear, the Baudelaires recognize Gunther as Count Olaf, despite his attempt to disguise his unibrow with a monocle and horse riding boots to cover up the tattoo of an eye on his ankle. Despite their protestations, Jerome takes the children to the restaurant. Jerome believes the children are being xenophobic, and dismisses their suspicions of Gunther.

Klaus notices that there is one elevator door on each floor except for the top floor, which has two. The children discover that the extra elevator is &quot;ersatz&quot;, fake, and consists of nothing but an empty shaft. They climb down the shaft, to find the two Quagmire triplets trapped in a cage at the bottom of the shaft. The Quagmires say that Count Olaf is planning to smuggle them out of the city by hiding them as an object at the &quot;In&quot; auction, which one of his associates will bid on. The Baudelaires return to the penthouse to find tools with which they can free the Quagmires, but they return to find that Gunther has cast the Quagmires away already. They return, dispirited, to the penthouse.

Klaus finds a Lot #50, V.F.D., in the auction catalog. The Baudelaires believe this is the item the Quagmires will be hidden in, because the Quagmires had told them (at the end of &quot;The Austere Academy&quot;) that Count Olaf was involved in a secret called V.F.D. The Baudelaires tell Esmé about this, but it is revealed that Esmé knew who Gunther was, and was actually in on the plan to kidnap the Quagmires. When the Baudelaires show her the ersatz elevator, she pushes them down the empty shaft. They land halfway down in a net.

Sunny climbs up the shaft with her razor sharp teeth, gets the ersatz rope and jumps back down into the net. Sunny bites a hole in the net, and using the rope, they climb down from the net. Using Violet&#x27;s ersatz welding torches, they travel along the hallway at the bottom of the shaft, only to find that it leads to a . Pounding on the &quot;ceiling&quot; reveals that it is in fact a trap door; the children escape through it, and find themselves in the ashes of their old home.

They rush to Veblen Hall, the location of the auction, and join the crowd already there. The auction has begun, and Gunther and Esmé are on the stage auctioning off Lot #46. The children ask Jerome to buy them Lot #50. Mr. Poe and Jerome both bid and then back down, but Sunny bids on it and wins. The Baudelaires open the box (without paying), only to reveal Very Fancy Doilies instead of the Quagmires. Gunther slips on the doilies and is revealed as Count Olaf when his boots and monocle fly off, revealing his unibrow and tattoo. Count Olaf and Esmé flee, pursued by the audience. The doorman is revealed as the Hook-Handed Man, and the Quagmires are hidden in the statue of a red herring. Although Jerome wants to keep the Baudelaires, he insists on taking them far away so Count Olaf will not bother them. They refuse this, however, because they want to rescue the Quagmires.

The story ends when Jerome is forced to give them up, because he is not brave enough to help them, Mr. Poe is calling a Vietnamese restaurant instead of the police, and the three children are sitting on the steps in front of Veblen Hall.

==Foreshadowing==
In the last picture of &quot;The Ersatz Elevator&quot;, a crow is flying overhead, foreshadowing the crow-obsessed village in &quot;The Vile Village&quot;.

==Cultural and literary allusions==

*The opening discussion of &quot;nervous&quot; versus &quot;anxious&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;The Giver&quot; written by Lois Lowry.
*The Café Salmonella is a reference to salmon and to the disease of the same name.
*&quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; is a novel by Thomas Pynchon in which a set of rare stamps are sold in Lot 49 of an auction.
*Esmé Gigi Geniveve Squalor&#x27;s name is a reference to J. D. Salinger&#x27;s story &quot;For Esmé – with Love and Squalor&quot;. Esmé&#x27;s husband Jerome shares his first name with Salinger. Both have the initials &quot;J.S.&quot;, which is a recurring acronym in the series.
*&quot;Red herring&quot; is a phrase used when talking about a distraction. The statue of the red herring contained the two surviving Quagmire triplets.
*The Verne Invention Museum is a reference to Jules Verne.
*Akhmatova Book Store is a reference to a Russian poet.
*Pincus Hospital, we learn, is where Sunny was born. This is a reference to Gregory Goodwin Pincus, inventor of the contraceptive pill.
*Gunther, Olaf&#x27;s disguise, may refer to the ancient King of Burgundy Gunther or to Karl Lagerfeld a German fashion designer.
*Jerome Squalor, when discussing xenophobia, mentions Galileo and Jun&#x27;ichirō Tanizaki.
*There are 1,849 windows in 667 Dark Avenue. 1849 is the year in which Edgar Allan Poe died.
*&quot;Armani&quot;, another one of Sunny&#x27;s utterances, is a reference to Armani, an expensive clothing brand.
* 667 Dark Avenue is one number away from 666, a number often associated with evil (in a joke, it is &quot;The Neighbour-across-the-street of the Beast&quot;.). Also, there are 66 floors in the building and this is the sixth book, two more references to the number 6.
* Veblen Hall, site of the auction of mostly useless goods, may be a reference to Thorstein Veblen, economist, who coined the phrase &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot;.
*When the Baudelaires first climb the stairs to the penthouse, they overhear a woman say &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;. This quote is often erroneously attributed to Marie Antoinette.
*One of the books in the Squalor library is titled &quot;Boots Were In in 1812&quot;. This may be a reference to Napoleon&#x27;s retreat from Moscow in 1812.
* References to the Donner Party

<doc id="664296" wikidata="Q7985433" url="?curid=664296" title="West Hyattsville station">
<text>West Hyattsville station is a Washington Metro station in Hyattsville, Maryland on the Green Line. It is the first station in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland northeast on the Green Line, and is located at 2700 Hamilton Street, near the west side of Ager Road and the north side of Queens Chapel Road.

With an average of 1,511 daily riders, West Hyattsville was the 67th-busiest Metro station in 2023.

==History==
The station was originally known as &quot;Chillum&quot; but was changed to &quot;West Hyattsville&quot; in 1979, well before services began on December 11, 1993.

The Yellow Line began serving West Hyattsville as of June 18, 2012 when the Metro Rush+ Initiative was introduced, which extended the Yellow Line from Fort Totten all the way up to Greenbelt, by way of the already existing Green Line Metrorail Train tracks, during weekday rush hour/peak period commuter times. The Yellow Line originally terminated at Mount Vernon Square but was later on extended to Fort Totten on December 31, 2006 as part of a 12-month experiment during off peak commuter times and weekends, at the suggestion of D.C. Councilmember, Jim Graham. Due to its success, this extension of the Yellow Line was made permanent around May, 2008. However; on June 25, 2017, Metro&#x27;s Yellow Line trains stopped serving the West Hyattsville station due to the elimination of Rush+, which was part of major changes to the Metrorail system.

However; on May 20, 2019, Metro announced that Yellow Line trains will be re-extended from Mount Vernon Square and Fort Totten to Greenbelt at all service hours beginning May 25, 2019.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

From July 22 to September 4, 2023, this station was shut down to improve rail system technologies, including free shuttle bus services to closed stations north of .

==Station layout==

The station is located west of the intersection with Queens Chapel Road and Ager Road. A parking lot, park and ride (formerly the site of the Queens Chapel Drive-In Theater and Mighty Mo Drive-In Restaurant, which closed during the late 1970&#x27;s), and bus bays are located east of the station&#x27;s side platforms. The red-brick Kirkwood Apartment Complex and Kirkwood Neighborhood Park can be seen on Ager Road, west of the station site. There used to be an abandoned red brick Palmer Ford Warehouse Building housed on the field right behind the West Hyattsville station, right next to the Kirkwood Apartment Complex. However; that site has been demolished around 2018 to make room for the construction of brand new luxury apartment complexes as part of gentrification taking place in the area. The West Hyattsville station also sits on the former Queens Chapel Municipal Airport Site, which was closed and demolished in 1955.

<text>Book the Seventh: The Vile Village is the seventh novel in the children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. 

In &quot;The Vile Village&quot;, the Baudelaire orphans are taken into the care of a whole village, only to find many rules and chores, evil seniors, as well as Count Olaf and his evil girlfriend lurking nearby.

This book marks a turning point in the structure of the series and effectively marks the halfway mark between books one to six and eight to thirteen. It breaks with the following major patterns of the earlier books in the series:

* The Baudelaires can no longer call on Mr. Poe for assistance, although he was barely any help to begin with.
* The Baudelaires themselves are deemed &quot;criminals&quot;, and they are not assigned any more legal guardians after this point.
* Because the authorities turn their attention away from him, Count Olaf is no longer obliged to use disguises.

==Plot==
Mr. Poe receives a brochure about a program where villages have signed up to communally raise children—the Baudelaires choose the village V.F.D., an abbreviation which the Quagmire children communicated to them while being kidnapped at the end of &quot;The Austere Academy&quot;. The village has a large number of unusual rules, created by the Council of Elders: their newest rule, outlawing villains, is meant to keep out Count Olaf. The children will live with the village&#x27;s handyman, Hector. He tells them that the initials stand for the Village of Fowl Devotees—in reference to the large number of crows which follow very specific roosting patterns. At sunset they fly to Nevermore Tree, outside Hector&#x27;s house.

Hector shows the children a couplet he found underneath Nevermore Tree, which resembles Isadora Quagmire&#x27;s style of poetry. The children stay awake to see if any more messages arrive, and discover a second couplet the next morning. Along with Hector, they do chores for individual townspeople. After cleaning the crow-shaped Fowl Fountain, a council member tells them that Count Olaf has been captured by the new Chief of Police, Officer Luciana. Though the imprisoned man has a unibrow and a tattoo of an eye on his left ankle, he is not Count Olaf. He says that his name is Jacques. Nonetheless, the villagers plan to burn him at the stake—the punishment for breaking one of the town&#x27;s rules.

Violet helps Hector with last-minute fixes to an invention he has been working on, against the rules of the town: a self-sustaining hot air mobile home so that he can fly away from the town and live up in the air. The next morning, after the children find another couplet, Count Olaf has arrived, disguised as Detective Dupin, and Jacques is dead. Olaf frames the children, who are jailed and will be burned at the stake the next day. He plans to smuggle one of them away to steal their fortune.

The children are given bread and a pitcher of water, as Klaus realizes that it is his thirteenth birthday. At Violet&#x27;s instruction, the children spend the night repeatedly pouring the water down a wooden bench onto the jail cell wall, before reabsorbing it with the spongy bread. This slowly dissolves the mortar between the bricks in the wall, until a hole can be made by using the bench as a battering ram. They escape, after Hector passes them a fourth couplet through their cell window. Meanwhile, Klaus discovers that the first letter of each line in the couplets, read in order, spells &quot;fountain&quot;.

The children work out that the Quagmires must be hidden in the beak of Fowl Fountain. Sunny stands on Klaus&#x27;s shoulders as he stands on Violet&#x27;s shoulders. Violet and Klaus fall and as Sunny is slipping off the fountain, she sinks her teeth into a crow eye that opens the fountain&#x27;s beak. With the Quagmire children, the Baudelaires flee the villagers, who have formed an angry mob. As they run, the Quagmires explained that from inside the fountain, they could attach a message to a crow by morning who would take it to Nevermore Tree, where it would fall off.

When Hector is directly overhead, on the functioning self-sustained hot air mobile home, he sends down the ladder. As the home continually rises, the Quagmire children climb, followed by the Baudelaires. With a harpoon gun, Luciana aims for the balloons to make the home fall to the ground. Once the Quagmires are in the home, she hits the ladder instead, and the Baudelaires have to climb down to the ground to avoid falling to their deaths. The Quagmires throw down their commonplace notebooks, but Luciana succeeds in skewering both of them with a harpoon.

However, Luciana also injures a crow with the harpoon, causing the villagers to turn on her. She reveals herself as Esmé Squalor, now Olaf&#x27;s girlfriend, and escapes with him by motorcycle. The villagers leave to take care of the crow and the Baudelaires collect the damaged fragments of the Quagmire&#x27;s notebooks. Sunny takes her first steps unaided as the children leave the town on foot.

==Foreshadowing==
The last picture of &quot;The Vile Village&quot; shows Klaus in the foreground, trying to pick up the scraps of the Quagmires&#x27; commonplace books, and Violet and Sunny in the background, being blown about by the wind, about to walk into the horizon of emptiness. A copy of The Daily Punctilio appears in the scene, with an ad for the Last Chance General Store, a reference to &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot;.

==Cultural references and literary allusions==
*The Nevermore Tree is a reference to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;, in which a raven repeats the word &quot;Nevermore&quot;.
*At the start of the novel Mr. Poe receives a phone call from a Mr. Fagin, a distant relative who informs Poe that he cannot take the orphans. In &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Fagin is a nefarious character who uses orphaned children in his criminal exploits. 
*Olaf&#x27;s alias, Detective Dupin, is a reference most likely to C. Auguste Dupin, a fictional detective character created by Edgar Allan Poe, but possibly to Arsène Lupin, a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise created by French writer Maurice Leblanc.
*Mr. Lesko, a town resident, has the same last name as the author Matthew Lesko, who offered to teach how to get free things. Mr. Lesko says in this book that he is fine with getting his chores done for him but not having to parent the Baudelaires (he wants free laborers).
*&quot;It takes a village to raise a child&quot; is a well-known proverb.

<text>Book the Eighth: The Hostile Hospital is the eighth novel in the children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket, the pseudonym of Daniel Handler. It takes place shortly after &quot;The Vile Village&quot; and is followed by a sequel, &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;.

==Plot==
After escaping the Village of Fowl Devotees, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire arrive at a store to send a telegram to Mr. Poe, explaining their situation and pleading for help. The store&#x27;s generous owner explains that a van of &#x27;Volunteers Fighting Disease&#x27; arrives once every day for a gas refill. The van arrives, and the Baudelaires, thinking it to be the acronym &#x27;V.F.D.&#x27;, escape into it after the owner recognizes them as the accused murderers in the &quot;Daily Punctilio&quot;, an unreliable newspaper series.

The Baudelaires discover that Volunteers Fighting Diseases is a group of enthusiasts that visit Heimlich Hospital to increase the morale of patients, who believe that &#x27;No News Is Good News&#x27;, and therefore have never read &quot;The Daily Punctilio&quot; (and don&#x27;t recognize the Baudelaires). One of the members suggests the Baudelaires seek a Library of Records to find their V.F.D.
The three then volunteer to aid Hal, a visually disabled elder who works in Heimlich Hospital&#x27;s Library of Records. As he doesn&#x27;t let them read any of the files, the Baudelaires regretfully trick him into giving them his keys to enter the library at night. While reading a file on the Baudelaires, in which only the thirteenth page remained since investigators have taken the rest, they discover that one of their parents may have survived or escaped the mansion&#x27;s fire – however, Esmé Squalor enters the library, intent on destroying them and the files to clear Count Olaf&#x27;s name in the crimes he has committed.

While escaping her clutches, Klaus and Sunny go through a small shaft, but Violet is taken when Count Olaf captures her and hides her from her siblings. The two, using the volunteers&#x27; list of patients, find out that Count Olaf has disguised Violet&#x27;s name with another name with the use of anagrams, and track her down to the surgery room. Dr. Mattathias Madycle-Sküll (who is Count Olaf), the Head of Human Resources, announces via intercom that a craniectomy will be performed on Violet in an operation theatre. Klaus and Sunny disguise themselves as Dr. Tocuna and Nurse Flo to perform the surgery with the Hook-handed man and the Bald Man, both of which are recurring associates of Count Olaf.

While the two stall during the performance for Violet to wake up, Hal angrily accuses the Baudelaires of committing arson, and the hospital begins to burn to the ground. Violet eventually awakens, and they try to escape by hiding in a storage room while Olaf&#x27;s henchperson of indeterminate gender tries to break in. They safely jump out of the window via Violet&#x27;s makeshift bungee rope while Olaf&#x27;s henchperson gets stuck and dies in the fire. They then hide in the trunk of Count Olaf&#x27;s car after overhearing him discuss hunting down the Snicket files, which apparently contains crucial information on V.F.D, Jacques Snicket, and the Baudelaires.

==Foreshadowing==
The last picture of &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot; shows Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are crammed into the trunk of Count Olaf&#x27;s car. Among other items in the trunk are a crystal ball, a flier with &quot;Madame Lulu&quot; printed across the top, and a scrap of paper on which is drawn an eye. This is a reference to Madame Lulu in &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;.

<text>Book the Ninth: The Carnivorous Carnival is the ninth novel in the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket.

==Plot summary==
Following the events of &quot;The Hostile Hospital&quot;, Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire arrive at Caligari Carnival in the trunk of Count Olaf and his theatre troupe&#x27;s car, unknown to them. Olaf and his associates speak of seeking Madame Lulu, a mysterious fortune-teller and owner of Caligari Carnival, for answers of the whereabouts of the Snicket files, which apparently contains crucial information on V.F.D. As the troupe discuss with Lulu, the Baudelaires escape the trunk and disguise themselves as freak volunteers for the Carnival&#x27;s freak show, Violet and Klaus as a two-headed humanoid &#x27;Beverly&#x27; and &#x27;Elliot&#x27;, and Sunny as &#x27;Chabo the Wolf Baby&#x27;, a supposed half-wolf.

After being accepted by Lulu, they meet three other freaks in the &#x27;Freak Caravan&#x27;: Hugo, a hunchback; Kevin, who is ambidextrous; and Colette, a contortionist. The Baudelaires are oblivious to the reason of their self-consciousness on their rare abilities. Every day they are forced to perform and be ridiculed in front of a small audience.

The next day, Count Olaf announces that a freak will be chosen to be fed to a pack of abused lions, in order to increase the popularity of the carnival. Olaf tells Esmé Squalor that Madame Lulu has predicted the whereabouts of the remaining Baudelaire parent to be in a V.F.D headquarters located in the Mortmain Mountains. Violet, Klaus and Sunny explore Madame Lulu&#x27;s tent, where she supposedly predicts answers using a glass ballhowever, they discover that she tricked Olaf into thinking so by using a machine to create the effects, and either guesses the answer or finds the answers in her secret archival library. Madame Lulu enters, and after hollering at the Baudelaires for trespassing, is shamed into revealing her true identity as Olivia. Olivia explains that she goes by the motto &#x27;Give People What They Want&#x27;, thus her feeding Olaf information. She reveals to be part of V.F.D, and admits to only be guessing one of their parents to be in Mortmain Mountains after the Baudelaires reveal themselves to her.

After striking a deal with her to bring her with them when they explore Mortmain Mountains, on the condition that she doesn&#x27;t tell Olaf their true identities, the three return to the Freak Caravan, where Esme Squalor, who is jealous of Madame Lulu, convinces Hugo, Kevin and Colette to feed Madame Lulu to the lions the following dayin exchange, they will be employed as Olaf&#x27;s associates. Shortly after Violet works on fixing the carnival&#x27;s roller coaster to use to travel to the Mortmain Mountains, the Baudelaires are forced to participate in the lion show. Count Olaf announces Violet and Klaus (as Beverly and Elliot) to be fed to the lions, they stall the feeding and cause a commotion among the audience allowing them to escapehowever, Olaf&#x27;s bald associate and Olivia fall into the lion pit to their deaths.

After it becomes apparent they can&#x27;t continue the roller coaster plan, Olaf, (after burning down the majority of the carnival) invites them to join on a quest to the Mortmain Mountains. Believing this to be the only way to arrive there, they agree and ride on a caravan attached to the troupe&#x27;s car. However, Olaf reveals that Lulu told him that they were the Baudelaires in disguise, and takes Sunny while the newly recruited freaks cut the rope connecting the car and caravan on a steep cliff, leaving the book on a literal cliffhanger.

==Foreshadowing==

<text>Book the Tenth: The Slippery Slope is the tenth novel in the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. It was illustrated by Brett Helquist and published on September 23, 2003. In the novel, Violet and Klaus Baudelaire make their way up the Mortmain Mountains to rescue their sister Sunny from Count Olaf and his troupe. They meet Quigley Quagmire, a character who they thought to be dead, and visit the headquarters of a mysterious organization called &quot;V.F.D.&quot; They are reunited with Sunny and manage to escape from Olaf. The book has received positive reviews and been translated into several different languages.

==Plot==
Continuing on from &quot;The Carnivorous Carnival&quot;, Violet and Klaus are in a caravan rolling down the Mortmain Mountains. Sunny is trapped in a car with Count Olaf, Esmé, and the theater troupe, which now includes the carnival&#x27;s henchpeople. From materials in the caravan, Violet frantically constructs a drag chute and instructs Klaus to mix together sticky foodstuffs, which he pours on the tires. The caravan comes to a halt at the very edge of the cliff, and tumbles off when Violet and Klaus step out, leaving them with only a few clothes. They travel up the mountain and are attacked by Snow Gnats, so they take cover in a cave. Snow Scouts, led by Bruce (the man who collected Uncle Monty&#x27;s reptiles from &quot;The Reptile Room&quot;), are occupying the cave, and Carmelita Spats (a student from &quot;The Austere Academy&quot;) is to be crowned Snow Queen. A masked Snow Scout communicates with the Baudelaires with &quot;V.F.D.&quot; phrases such as &quot;very foul day&quot;. At night, the scout wakes Violet and Klaus and leads them up a chimney. He calls it a &quot;Vertical Flame Diversion&quot; and at the end they reach a &quot;Vernacularly Fastened Door&quot;, which allows the trio through once they solve three literary questions.

Meanwhile, Olaf and his troupe have reached the summit of Mount Fraught, and Sunny is forced to do their chores. She sleeps in a casserole dish in the car trunk. The next morning, she prepares breakfast for the troupe, but Olaf is furious at the cold meal. Two villains arrive, described as &quot;the woman with hair but no beard&quot; and &quot;the man with a beard but no hair&quot;. Their aura frightens even Olaf, and they announce that they have burned down the nearby V.F.D. headquarters. They give Olaf the Snicket File, without the last page, and give Esmé a green object called a Verdant Flammable Device. Sunny uses the device to create smoke, which she hopes her siblings will see.

Violet, Klaus, and the masked Snow Scout are now in the ruins of the V.F.D. headquarters. The Snow Scout is Quigley, the Quagmire triplet whose siblings thought he perished in the fire that killed their parents. He explains that during the fire his mother hid him in an underground passage, which led to Uncle Monty&#x27;s house. He learned about V.F.D. from Jacques Snicket shortly after the Baudelaires departed from Monty&#x27;s house and traveled to find his siblings. Violet, Klaus, and Quigley then see green smoke from the mountain above them, and Violet constructs a device from a ukulele and forks, which can be used to climb the frozen stream. She travels up with Quigley and they reach Sunny, who wants to spy on Olaf. Violet reluctantly agrees, and climbs back down with Quigley.

In the V.F.D. library, Klaus has found a page from a code book explaining &quot;Verbal Fridge Dialogue&quot;, and from the contents of a fridge in the headquarters, he learns that there is a meeting in the &quot;last safe place&quot; on Thursday. When Violet and Quigley arrive, the three plot to trap Esmé in order to exchange her for Sunny. They dig a pit overnight and lure Esmé down with a Verdant Flammable Device of Quigley&#x27;s, but after becoming uncomfortable with the idea of kidnapping, they tell Esmé to avoid the pit. Wearing masks, they climb back up the stream with the toboggan that Esmé rode down on.

Klaus pretends to be a volunteer who will trade the location of the sugar bowl for Sunny. As Olaf and Esmé argue, the Snow Scout troupe arrive and Carmelita is crowned False Spring Queen. Olaf and Esmé invite her to join the troupe. Though the children warn them, the Snow Scouts are ensnared in a net by eagles that fly away with them. Olaf orders Sunny to be thrown off the mountain, but the White-Faced Women refuse and quit the troupe. Olaf tries to throw Sunny off the mountain, but she is hiding behind the car, not sleeping in the casserole dish. The three Baudelaires and Quigley escape down the stream with the toboggan, but the ice has now cracked enough to shatter the waterfall and separate Quigley from the Baudelaires.

==Foreshadowing==
The last picture of &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot; shows Violet, wearing a poncho, and Sunny on a wooden raft, floating down the Stricken Stream. Violet is holding onto Klaus, who is in the water, and Quigley is seen upstream, holding on to another wooden raft, and holding his commonplace notebook up in the air. In a reference to the Medusoid mycelium, the fungus featured in &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot;, one can see mushrooms growing on the cliffs of the Mortmain Mountains.

==Publication==
The book was released on September 23, 2003, with an initial print run of one million copies. No advance copies were produced for reviewers. As promotion, Handler appeared at book signings in New Jersey, California, Washington and Minnesota under the guise of being author Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;official representative&quot;.

The book&#x27;s sales of 900,000 copies in 2003 placed it second in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;″s list of bestselling children&#x27;s hardback books, following &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. Overall sales of &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; books increased from 3.3 million the previous year to 3.8 million. In August 2006, the magazine reported that there were two million copies of &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot; in print.

==Analysis==
The book features dark humour. It continues the Baudelaires&#x27; personal development, with Sunny uttering her first sentence, &quot;I am not a baby&quot;. The children show moral development in their decision not to trap Esmé. The narrator also hints at a relationship developing between Violet and Quigley. Snicket omits description of an interaction between the pair &quot;to give them a bit of privacy&quot;, which provides more information than it conceals, indicating that the interaction was romantic. Olaf&#x27;s troupe also demonstrate character development, the white-faced women refusing to co-operate with Olaf&#x27;s plan to throw Sunny off a mountain. The book ends on a cliffhanger.

==Reception==
The book entered the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; bestsellers list for fiction on October 3, 2003, at position #1, remaining in the list for twelve weeks up to December 19.

Krista Tokarz of &quot;School Library Journal&quot; praised the novel as a &quot;fast-paced continuation of the series&quot; with &quot;well-developed characters&quot;. Stephanie Zvirin of &quot;Booklist&quot; gave &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot; a positive review, saying that the author &quot;hasn&#x27;t lost his sense of the absurd or his momentum&quot;. Zvirin complimented the &quot;joyful wordplay and the quirky imaginative touches&quot;, describing the characters as &quot;true to form, ridiculous and fun&quot; and noting that Snicket&#x27;s &quot;wry telling is pitch-perfect&quot;. David Abrams of &quot;January Magazine&quot; gave the book a positive review, saying &quot;the delight in &quot;The Slippery Slope&quot; and others in this series is found in the way the author jauntily jots his jokes across the page.&quot; Norah Piehl from &quot;Kidsreads&quot; wrote that the book &quot;has all of the tongue-in-cheek wit that makes the series enjoyable for kids and adults alike&quot;, and that &quot;Snicket really outdoes himself&quot;.

<text>Book the Eleventh: The Grim Grotto is the eleventh novel in the children&#x27;s book series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; by Lemony Snicket. The book was released on Tuesday, September 21, 2004.

This novel tells the subsequent story of the Baudelaire orphans, who discover the crew of the &quot;Queequeg&quot; submarine searching for a mysterious sugar bowl in the eponymous grotto.

==Plot==
Having been separated from Quigley Quagmire by the waterfall of the Mortmain Mountains, the Baudelaire children arrive at the hull of the &quot;Queequeg&quot;, a submarine piloted by Captain Widdershins. They correctly guess the password, &quot;the world is quiet here&quot;, and enter the porthole to meet Widdershins along with his stepdaughter Fiona and the chef Cookie, who they recognise as the optimist Phil that used to work for the Lucky Smells Lumbermill (in &quot;The Miserable Mill&quot;). Widdershins is a V.F.D. member and knew the Baudelaire parents; he talks with urgency but often gives contradicting instructions. He is traveling to the last safe place, the Hotel Denouement, but must first locate the sugar bowl, though he will not tell them what is inside.

Klaus examines the tidal charts to estimate that the sugar bowl is in the Gorgonian Grotto, but is interrupted by sonar detection of an octopus-shaped submarine that they suspect is captained by Count Olaf. The submarine is chased away by the Great Unknown, which appears on the sonar as a question mark. Fiona, a mycologist, discovers that the Gorgonian Grotto is home to the Medusoid Mycelium, a dangerous fungus which can kill within an hour of inhalation. As the grotto is conical, the &quot;Queequeg&quot; reaches a point where it is too wide to pass through, and instead the Baudelaire children and Fiona venture further in diving outfits. Reaching a beach, the children search through detritus in vain and are delayed in their return by the waxing and waning of Medusoid Mycelium. Sunny cooks a meal with ingredients on the beach, saving the wasabi for their return, as the others discover instructions for communicating with Verse Fluctuation Declaration, in which a message is hidden in a poem that has some of its words replaced.

On the children&#x27;s return to the submarine, Widdershins and Phil are absent and Sunny is discovered to have been poisoned by Medusoid Mycelium. Olaf mounts the &quot;Queequeg&quot; and forces the children aboard his ship, the &quot;Carmelita&quot;. The ship is powered by the labor of kidnapped children such as the Snow Scouts, who are forced to watch Carmelita dance and sing. The Baudelaires and Fiona are taken to the brig. The hook-handed man—Fernald—is responsible for watching them, but the Baudelaires learn that he is Fiona&#x27;s brother. Fernald is ashamed of his decision to leave Widdershins and join Olaf&#x27;s troupe many years ago. He will help them return to the &quot;Queequeg&quot; if he can join them.

The Baudelaires successfully sneak past Carmelita and Esmé, but Fiona and Fernald are caught and forced to stay, under the premise that Fiona has defected to join Olaf. Violet realizes that it is her fifteenth birthday as Klaus discovers that horseradish is an antidote to the Medusoid Mycelium. Sunny calculates that wasabi should be a culinary equivalent and the wasabi from the beach is used to save her. A telegram from Quigley instructs the Baudelaires to meet him on Briny Beach, after using Verse Fluctuation Declaration on an extract of T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

Olaf discovers the Baudelaires&#x27; escape and rejoins them on the &quot;Queequeg&quot;. Fiona has defected to his troupe, genuinely this time. As he prepares to flee from the Great Unknown, which reappears on the radar, Fiona permits the Baudelaires to escape and gives Klaus a kiss goodbye. The children reach Briny Beach to find Mr. Poe—just as they did on the day they learned of their parents&#x27; death—but they leave him behind to enter a taxi with Kit Snicket at the wheel.

==Foreshadowing==
In the last picture of &quot;The Grim Grotto&quot;, Mr. Poe is seen waving to the Baudelaire orphans as they climb into a taxi. On the beach, there is a hat, half-buried in the sand, that reads &quot;Hotel D------.&quot; The rest is in sand. This is a reference to the Hotel Denouement, the hotel from &quot;The Penultimate Peril&quot;.

<text>Hyattsville Crossing station is a Washington Metro station in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the Green Line. It opened on December 11, 1993, as Prince George&#x27;s Plaza, referencing the nearby Prince George&#x27;s Plaza, now known as The Mall at Prince Georges. The station has a unique layout in that it is an open-cut side platformed station with a parking garage directly over the tracks.

==History==
The station is located in a commercial area of Hyattsville near The Mall at Prince Georges, which, before receiving its second name in November 2004, was called Prince George&#x27;s Plaza, at East-West Highway (Maryland Route 410) and Belcrest Road. Service began on December 11, 1993.

Originally, only Green Line trains served the station and ran between and . Eventually, this segment of the Green Line was connected with the rest of the Green Line in September 1999.

Rush hour Yellow Line trains began operating at this station on June 12, 2012, operating between Greenbelt and or . However, this service was discontinued on June 25, 2017, because of budget cuts.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Greenbelt station would be rebuilt starting on May 29, 2021, through September 6, 2021.

In November 2020, WMATA approved a request from Prince George&#x27;s County to change the name of the former Prince George&#x27;s Plaza station to Hyattsville Crossing, despite survey results noting people prefer the name Prince George&#x27;s Plaza due to the station being located in Prince George&#x27;s County and in relation to The Mall at Prince Georges while being situated within a plaza-like area. The new name took effect on September 11, 2022.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from Greenbelt to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

From July 22 to September 4, 2023, this station was closed to improve rail system technologies, closing stations north of .

==Station layout==
The station is located at the southwest corner of the East-West Highway (Maryland Route 410) and Belcrest Road intersection. The platform level is in an open-cut below ground level, containing two side platforms for each direction. This station has no canopy. Instead, a multilevel parking garage sits directly above the station and includes multiple taxi and bus stops. and a small surface parking lot on the side. Stairs and escalators lead from the ground level to the platform level. The station is surrounded by commercial and residential development, with pedestrian walkways leading to each. A pedestrian walkway immediately travels underneath the commercial development to the north and then over East-West Highway, connecting directly into The Mall at Prince Georges. A Capital Bikeshare rental station sits at the northeast side of the station, opposite the station&#x27;s eastern roundabout entrance.

<doc id="664308" wikidata="Q1758833" url="?curid=664308" title="Tokoloshe">
<text>In Nguni mythology, the tokoloshe, tikoloshe, tikolosh, tonkolosh, tonkolosi, tokolotshe, thokolosi, or hili is a dwarf-like water spirit. It is a mischievous and evil spirit that can become invisible by drinking water or swallowing a stone. Tokoloshes are called upon by malevolent people to cause trouble for others. At its least harmful, a tokoloshe can be used to scare children, but its power extends to causing illness or even the death of the victim. Protection against them includes traditional methods such as raising beds off the ground and interventions by spiritual figures like pastors with an apostolic calling or traditional healers (sangomas), who are seen to possess the power to banish them. The tokoloshe is often referenced satirically to critique the influence of superstitions on behaviour and society.

==Mythology ==
The advent of the phantom tokoloshe came about through Bantu folklore to explain why people inexplicably died while sleeping in their rondavels at night. Traditionally, these people slept on the floor on grass mats encircling a wood fire that kept them warm during sub-freezing cold winter nights on the highveld in the rarefied air. They never realized the fire was depleting the oxygen levels, leaving noxious carbon monoxide, which is heavier than pure air and sinks to the bottom. Eventually it was realized that anyone who happened to be sleeping in an elevated position escaped the deadly curse of the tokoloshe, which was described as a short man about hip high who randomly stole one&#x27;s life in the night unless they were lifted to the height of their bed. 

&quot;Some Zulu people (and other southern African tribes) are still superstitious when it comes to things like the supposedly fictional tokoloshe—a hairy creature created by a witch doctor to harm his enemies (also … known to bite off sleeping people&#x27;s toes).&quot;

According to legend, the only way to keep the tokoloshe away at night is to put a few bricks beneath each leg of one&#x27;s bed.

==Creation==
The client – usually a jealous person – will approach an evil witch doctor to take vengeance on someone. The client has to promise the soul of a loved one, but cannot choose who, as the tokoloshe will choose the soul it decides to take. The witch doctor locates a dead body to be possessed, piercing the eye sockets and brain with a hot iron rod so that it cannot think for itself, and sprinkling it with a special powder, shrinking the body. The tokoloshe is then let loose to terrorise its target, taking its payment of the soul of the client&#x27;s loved one for weeks, months, or maybe years later.

==In popular culture==
*Running gags about tokoloshes are common in the South African daily comic strip &quot;Madam &amp; Eve&quot;.
*&quot;Tokoloshe Man&quot; was a pop hit by John Kongos, later covered by Happy Mondays and released on the Elektra compilation album &quot;Rubáiyát&quot;.
*The video for Die Antwoord&#x27;s song &quot;Evil Boy&quot; features a tokoloshe.
* The word &quot;tokoloshe&quot; is mentioned several times in the 2003 film &quot;The Bone Snatcher&quot; by Titus when the team encounters an ant-like demonic creature.
*&quot;Hosh Tokoloshe&quot; is a tokoloshe-inspired pop/rap song by South African rapper Jack Parow.
* Belief in the tokoloshe is a major part of Gavin Hood&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;A Reasonable Man&quot;.
* Serial killer Elifasi Msomi claimed to have been influenced by a tokoloshe.
* A tokoloshe appears in every episode of the third series of the British TV show &quot;Mad Dogs&quot;, although only one character can see it, and it is left unclear as to whether it is real or a hallucination. At one point, the characters are told that if you see a tokoloshe, it means somebody will die.
* Tokoloshe is the full name of Tok, the mascot for the English surfing and clothing company Saltrock.
* DJ and musician Steve &quot;Toshk&quot; Shelley got his stagename as a derivation of tokoloshe.
*In Gene&#x27;s Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow of the Torturer&quot;, Severian is considered to be a tokoloshe by the Zulu shaman, Isangoma, he encounters in an aerial hut in the Botanic Gardens.

<doc id="664311" wikidata="Q518564" url="?curid=664311" title="Federal Minister for Special Affairs of Germany">
<text>A Federal Minister for Special Affairs (, ) is a member of the German government without portfolio.

Early Minister for Special Affairs were assigned different tasks by the Chancellor. For example, Robert Tillmanns, one of the first two Ministers for Special Affairs, represented the federal government in the Council of Elders of the Bundestag. Other responsibilities delegated to different Ministers for Special Affairs included the middle class, water management, the Federal Defense Council or the affairs of the Vice-Chancellor of Germany.

Since 1964, this use of the title fell out of favour. Instead, the title is often given to the Chief of staff of the Chancellery to provide him with a vote in cabinet meetings. The last Chief of staff of the Chancellery not to concurrently hold the title of minister special affairs was Frank-Walter Steinmeier (1999–2005), who instead retained the lower Secretary of State rank; however regardless of ministerial rank, the title &quot;Kanzleramtsminister&quot; (Minister of the Chancellery) is frequently used to refer to the job. Historically, appointees to the ministry who weren&#x27;t heads of the chancellery at the same time have often been important political aides or politicians waiting for a portfolio or representatives of certain parties, groups or regions. 

For instance, after German reunification in 1990, some members of the final East German government, former Association of Free Democrats (the affiliated group of the FDP, the then-junior coalition partner) Volkskammer leader Rainer Ortleb and President of the Volkskammer Sabine Bergmann-Pohl were appointed as Federal Ministers for Special Affairs, in order to provide a representation of the New states of Germany in the federal government.

<doc id="664313" wikidata="Q3563737" url="?curid=664313" title="College Park–University of Maryland station">
<text>College Park–University of Maryland station is a Washington Metro and MARC station located in College Park, Maryland, near the University of Maryland, College Park campus. It is served by the Metro Green Line and limited service on the MARC Camden Line. The light rail Purple Line is planned to begin service at the station in 2027.

==Station layout==

The station is located on the south side of Campus Parkway, about southeast of the campus center and adjacent to the College Park office park. The two-track Capital Subdivision (used by MARC) and the two-track Metro E Route run north-south through the station area, with the Capital Subdivision on the west side. An island platform serves Metro trains, with entrances from both sides of the rail lines leading to the underground fare concourse. Two small side platforms serve MARC trains; they have an entrance from the west side and an underpass crossing under the Metro tracks. The Metro platform is accessible, but the MARC platforms are not.

A 1,345-space parking garage and a bus plaza are located on the east side of the station. The station is served by Metrobus, The Bus, Laurel Connect-a-Ride, and a university shuttle route.

==History==
The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) opened its Washington Branch, now the Capital Subdivision, in 1835. A station served the 1856-opened Maryland Agricultural College (now University of Maryland, College Park) by 1878. B&amp;O Baltimore–Washington commuter service was taken over by MARC as the Camden Line in the 1980s.

Metro service at College Park began on December 11, 1993, with the extension of the Green Line to . The parking garage opened on June 25, 2005. In May 2012, the station became the first Metro station to feature a &quot;Bike &amp; Ride&quot; bike station. A mesh enclosure built into the adjacent parking garage, the facility can hold up to 120 bikes and has 24-hour access.

Metro Yellow Line service was extended to Greenbelt, serving College Park, during peak hours from June 18, 2012, to June 25, 2017, as park of the &quot;Rush+&quot; program. It was again extended to Greenbelt at all times on May 25, 2019. From March 26 to June 28, 2020, the station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. The Metro station was closed from May 29 to September 6, 2021, while the platform was rebuilt. Yellow Line service was suspended from September 10, 2022, to May 7, 2023. It was cut back to upon reopening, no longer serving College Park. From July 22 to September 4, 2023, the Green Line north of Fort Totten (including College Park) was closed for maintenance work.

The Purple Line, a light rail line, is under construction and planned to open in 2027. It will have a platform on the east side of the Metro tracks. In May 2024, the Federal Transit Administration awarded the MTA $1.4 million for design and engineering work to make the MARC station accessible. The new platforms would be long.

<text>The Dominican Liberation Party (Spanish: Partido de la Liberación Dominicana, referred to here by its Spanish acronym, the PLD) is a political party in the Dominican Republic. Founded in 1973 by former president Juan Bosch, the party, along with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (referred to here by its Spanish acronym, the PRD), and Social Christian Reformist Party, has dominated politics in the country since the establishment of democracy in the early 1960s. 

The PLD have won several elections since the late 1990s and had held control over much of the government until 2020, when the Modern Revolutionary Party (referred to here by its Spanish acronym, the PRM) won several governmental seats as well as the presidency with the election of Luis Abinader as president. The PLD party&#x27;s logo is a yellow five-pointed star on a purple background.

== Overview ==
The PLD has been a major player in the Dominican political landscape for many years. Since its founding in 1973, it has won 5 of the last 7 presidential elections. Two presidents have been from the PLD: Leonel Fernandez (1996–2000; 2004–2012) and Danilo Medina (2012–2020). Only Hipolito Mejia of the PRD interrupted the PLD party’s long line of electoral successes between 2000 and 2004. The PRD served as a forerunner to the PLD since it was founded by the same man, Juan Bosch. However, when Bosch disliked the direction in which the PRD was going in the early ‘70s, he left the party and founded the PLD in 1973.

== Founder and History ==
Juan Emilio Bosch Gaviño was a politician and historian who founded the modern-day PLD. Bosch first involved himself in politics in the late 1920s, when he predicted the ascendency of the military leader, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Trujillo took power in 1930 and began shutting down the opposition, including Bosch. In 1934, Bosch was arrested under suspicion of being part of a conspiracy to overthrow the government. Proven innocent, he was released from custody and a few years later left the Dominican Republic to go to Puerto Rico with his wife for “medical reasons.” In reality, he had exiled himself since he did not want to be a part of Trujillo’s increasingly oppressive government.

Bosch returned after Trujillo was assassinated in the early 1960s, and became the nation’s first democratically elected president in 1963 with the support of John F. Kennedy. He took a position against corruption and worked to better the country’s position post-dictatorship. However, he was overthrown by the military after just a few months in office. Political scientist Matias Bosch stated, however, that the United States would often withdraw their support of Latin American democracies if they felt it might threaten their interests, especially in light of the recently-revolutionized Cuba.

Bosch was exiled again and a civil war ensued soon thereafter, in an attempt to put Bosch in power again. This warranted intervention by the US government and a new democracy was established. This time, one of Trujillo’s original supporters, Joaquin Balaguer, won the presidency.

Bosch rejoined the PRD, but in the early 1970s, left the party because he felt that the PRD was only working for small and wealthy interest groups and not for the people. Bosch founded the PLD in 1973 and ran for president in several elections between 1978 and 1994 until finally retiring from political life in 1996, at the age of 87, when he conceded to a person whom some call his “disciple,” Leonel Fernandez, who ran as his vice president in the 1994 election.

== The Odebrecht Bribery Scandal ==
The Odebrecht Bribery Scandal was a scandal in which the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht paid millions of dollars in bribes to various governments in Africa and Latin America—including the Dominican Republic—for special construction contracts, occurring between 2001 and 2014. It spanned three Dominican presidents—Mejia, Fernandez, and Medina—the latter two of which were PLD. It was revealed that the company had paid more than 90 million dollars to the Dominican government and had been involved in construction projects that included aqueducts, hydroelectric plants, and roads and highways. This scandal that swept the whole of Latin America led to a lot of discontent and distrust among the citizens of the Dominican Republic towards the government. In fact, a new movement emerged called the Green March (Spanish: Marcha Verde) in protest of the scandal, which in fact was explicitly mentioned in their manifesto.

== 2020 Elections ==
The Dominican elections that occurred on July 5, 2020 represent the first time in 16 years that the PLD lost the presidency. The elections were postponed from May to July due to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 4 million people came out to vote, within the country and abroad. The candidate for the PLD was Gonzalo Castillo and for the PRM, Luis Abinader, who had run in 2016 against the PLD incumbent Danilo Medina. When the results came in, it was announced that Abinader had won the presidency with 54% of the vote compared to Castillo’s 37%. The PLD also lost several Senate and Parliamentary seats, effectively losing much of the hold they had had in the government years. In an Op-Ed article, the former PLD President Leonel Fernandez wrote that the results of the elections reflected a conjunction of several factors including the Odebrecht scandal and the recent protests in the country against the government of Medina and the PLD.

==Brief overview of election statistics==
The party has been elected into office five times now, with its last president Danilo Medina President of the Dominican Republic, in the 1996, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections, though losing in 2000. In May 2006 the party and its allies gained control of both houses of Congress. 

At the legislative elections, 16 May 2002, the party won 29.1% of the popular vote and 41 out of 150 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 2 out of 31 seats in the Senate. Its candidate at the presidential election of 16 May 2004, Leonel Fernández, won 57.1% of the vote.

Founded by Juan Bosch in 1973, the PLD originally was considerably to the left of Bosch&#x27;s original party, the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Bosch ran for president as the party’s candidate several times, but did not win. Following Bosch’s retirement, Fernandez became the leader of the party and won the 1996 presidential elections after forming an alliance with Dr. Joaquín Balaguer, Bosch’s political enemy for over 30 years. He did not run for another term in 2000 as he was term-limited, but returned to the presidency in 2004. The party&#x27;s logo is a yellow five-pointed star on a purple background.

In the 16 May 2006 legislative elections, the party led the Progressive Bloc, that won 96 out of 178 deputies and 22 out of 32 senators.

On May 16, 2008, presidential elections were carried and PLD candidate Leonel Fernández won 54%, defeating 7 other presidential candidates. 

On May 16, 2010, congressional and municipal elections held, the Dominican Liberation Party won a majority of senators (31 of 32) and representatives, as well the largest number of mayors around the country. 

On May 20, 2012 the PLD won its third straight presidential elections with its candidate Danilo Medina, with 51.2% of the vote, against former president Hipólito Mejía, from the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) who obtained 46.9% on these elections. 

By 2016, the PLD has retained the presidency of the Dominican Republic for 16 out of the previous 20 years, and has become the only party in the Dominican Republic to have attained this achievement in the country&#x27;s democratic history after the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo which lasted between 1930 until 1961. 

On July 5, 2020, the party&#x27;s 16-year rule in the Dominican Republic officially ended after losing to the rival Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM).

<text>Greenbelt station is a Washington Metro and MARC station in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The station is the northeastern terminus of the Green Line of the Washington Metro. MARC commuter rail trains on the Camden Line also stop at Greenbelt on a set of tracks parallel to the Metro tracks.

The station is located in the city of Greenbelt, at its northwestern border (near Berwyn Heights, Beltsville, and the northern part of College Park), off of Cherrywood Lane, near the Capital Beltway. It has a parking lot that contains more than 3,300 spaces, with convenient access both to the outer loop of the Beltway (Interstate 95 North) and from the inner loop of the Beltway (Interstate 95 South). It serves as a commuter station for both local residents and commuters who arrive from elsewhere — such as those who travel on the inner loop of the Beltway or south on I-95 from Baltimore. Also available at the station is a weekday express Metrobus service, the B30 route to Baltimore–Washington International Airport (BWI), allowing for connections to Baltimore&#x27;s regional transit services, which has been suspended since March 2020 and permanently discontinued due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Greenbelt Metro is the most accessible station for employees and visitors of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center, who can connect to TheBus&#x27;s route 15X.

In-between Metro&#x27;s Greenbelt and stations, trains pass Lake Artemesia, which was created as part of the construction of the two stations. The Greenbelt Rail Yard is also nearby, the largest storage yard in the Metrorail network.

== History ==
Metro service at Greenbelt began on December 11, 1993, coinciding with the opening of three other stations in northern Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland — the completion of 7.96 miles of Green Line rail north of in Washington, D.C. In 1979, before opening, the name was changed from &quot;Greenbelt Road&quot; to just &quot;Greenbelt&quot;.
The Greenbelt station played a role during the January 20, 2009 presidential inauguration of Barack Obama. Prior to this date, a decision was made by Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) officials not to allow private cars to park at this station in order to allow more than 1,100 charter buses to use the parking. However, only 35 such requests were made by private bus companies, and WMATA then reversed its decision, opening up 3,400 spaces to private vehicles.

On June 25, 2017, Metro&#x27;s Yellow Line trains stopped serving the station due to the elimination of Rush+, which was part of major changes to the Metrorail system. On May 20, 2019, Metro announced that Yellow Line trains will be re-extended from Mount Vernon Square and Fort Totten to Greenbelt at all service hours beginning May 25, 2019.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platforms at the Greenbelt station would be rebuilt starting on May 29, 2021 through September 6, 2021. On April 8, 2021, a COVID-19 mass vaccination site was opened in the parking lot of Greenbelt station.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from this station to , following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into . Thus, it no longer services this station.

From July 22 to September 4, 2023, the Metro station was closed to improve rail system technologies, along with all other Green Line stations north of .

== Station layout ==
Metro trains stop at an island platform, while MARC trains utilize two high-level side platforms. All platforms are accessible to riders with disabilities, but the MARC station is unstaffed and lacking facilities.

<text>Navy Yard–Ballpark station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green Line. The station is located in the Navy Yard/Near Southeast neighborhood of Southeast, with entrances on M Street at Half Street and New Jersey Avenue.

== Station layout ==
The station uses the island platform layout with two tracks. Track F1 is used by trains to Greenbelt while Branch Avenue-bound trains use track F2. It also features the 22-coffer &quot;waffle&quot; ceiling vault design among , , , , and .
==History==
A station serving the Navy Yard area existed in original plans for Metro; however, the routing of the Green Line below proved controversial. In 1976, the original routing was rejected as too costly and disruptive. A new study proposed a more westerly path which would move the Anacostia station west, replace the Good Hope Road station with one at Congress Heights, and terminate at a station (named &quot;Rosecroft&quot; in plans and Metro maps) near Brinkley Road and Rosecroft Drive in Fort Washington instead of Branch Avenue in Suitland. During December 1977 public hearings, this route was criticized as disserving more impoverished landowners in the area, but Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) approved the western route in 1980, scheduled to open in 1986. Supporters of the Branch Avenue route then took the case to the U.S. District Court.

The court ruled in February 1981 that the 1977 hearings were invalid, as insufficient public notice had been given. It issued an injunction halting construction below the Waterfront station. New hearings were held in June 1982, but the court again ruled against WMATA in October 1983. The third set of hearings in July 1984 selected the present route, allowing construction to commence. Service to the station began on December 28, 1991, with the extension of the Green Line to Anacostia&#x27;s station.

===New stadiums===
Due to the construction of the Washington Nationals&#x27; new stadium and other nearby projects, the Navy Yard–Ballpark station underwent a significant expansion to serve game-day crowds and expected increase in daily traffic from new residents and workers. WMATA announced that it carried 21,492 people to the inaugural game on March 31, 2008, over half the total crowd; it was hailed as a success. Passengers exit the station near the park&#x27;s center field entrance.

Audi Field, a new soccer stadium for D.C. United, was built near Nationals Park and relies on Navy Park–Ballpark station for matchday transport. The stadium has no parking, and D.C. United expects that 60 percent of ticket holders will use Metro.

===Naming===

Originally named simply Navy Yard for the nearby Washington Navy Yard, the station was renamed Navy Yard–Ballpark on November 3, 2011, reflecting the 2008 opening of Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team. The construction of the US Department of Transportation office complex and the $600 million Nationals Park have spurred rapid growth in the neighborhood. Most of the neighborhood&#x27;s land and businesses have been purchased by companies and is currently being developed into commercial and residential projects. The area plans to contain of office space, 9,000 residential units, 1,200 hospitality rooms, of retail space, four public parks, and an Anacostia Riverwalk trail system.

==Location==
The Navy Yard area in Southeast DC has been undergoing significant development with subsequent gentrification both residentially and commercially. Nationals Park is possibly the biggest catalyst for redevelopment currently and is only located one block south of the station with easy access using the Half Street SE exit. The headquarters of the United States Department of Transportation (USDoT) are also near the station, across the street from the New Jersey Avenue, SE exit.

<text>Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank plc is a British bank wholly owned by Sainsbury&#x27;s. The bank began trading on 19 February 1997 as a joint venture between Sainsbury&#x27;s and Bank of Scotland. Sainsbury&#x27;s took full ownership of the bank in January 2014.

The bank&#x27;s head office is located in Edinburgh, Scotland, and its registered office in London, England. In 2017 it had over 2.1 million active customers.

==History==
Sainsbury&#x27;s and Bank of Scotland (later a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group) formed the bank as a joint venture, and it received a full banking licence from the Bank of England in January 1997. It launched on 19 February 1997.

On 8 May 2013, Sainsbury&#x27;s announced it would buy the 50% share in the business owned by Lloyds Banking Group. The transfer was completed on 31 January 2014, and Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Sainsbury&#x27;s.

In January 2024, Sainsbury’s announced its intention to phase out its banking division. In June 2024, it was announced the credit cards, loans and savings accounts had been acquired by NatWest in a deal due for completion by March 2025. The Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank brand, its cash machines, insurance and travel money businesses were not included.

==Services==
The bank provides a range of financial products including travel money, insurance, credit cards, savings and loans, having withdrawn from the mortgage market in 2019. It is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. Sainsbury&#x27;s Bank products are linked to the Nectar reward scheme and can be applied for online or by telephone.

==Finances==
In the 2019-20 financial year, the bank had an income of £323 million, customer deposits of £6.3 billion, and total assets of £9.4 billion.

<text>Econophysics is a non-orthodox (in economics) interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes and nonlinear dynamics. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed statistical finance referring to its roots in statistical physics. Econophysics is closely related to social physics.

==History==
Physicists&#x27; interest in the social sciences is not new (see e.g.,); Daniel Bernoulli, as an example, was the originator of utility-based preferences. One of the founders of neoclassical economic theory, former Yale University Professor of Economics Irving Fisher, was originally trained under the renowned Yale physicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs. Likewise, Jan Tinbergen, who won the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969 for having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes, studied physics with Paul Ehrenfest at Leiden University. In particular, Tinbergen developed the gravity model of international trade that has become the workhorse of international economics.

Econophysics was started in the mid-1990s by several physicists working in the subfield of statistical mechanics. Unsatisfied with the traditional explanations and approaches of economists – which usually prioritized simplified approaches for the sake of soluble theoretical models over agreement with empirical data – they applied tools and methods from physics, first to try to match financial data sets, and then to explain more general economic phenomena.

One driving force behind econophysics arising at this time was the sudden availability of large amounts of financial data, starting in the 1980s. It became apparent that traditional methods of analysis were insufficient – standard economic methods dealt with homogeneous agents and equilibrium, while many of the more interesting phenomena in financial markets fundamentally depended on heterogeneous agents and far-from-equilibrium situations.

The term &quot;econophysics&quot; was coined by H. Eugene Stanley, to describe the large number of papers written by physicists in the problems of (stock and other) markets, in a conference on statistical physics in Kolkata (erstwhile Calcutta) in 1995 and first appeared in its proceedings publication in Physica A 1996. The inaugural meeting on econophysics was organised in 1998 in Budapest by János Kertész and Imre Kondor. The first book on econophysics was by R. N. Mantegna &amp; H. E. Stanley in 2000.

The almost regular meeting series on the topic include: Econophys-Kolkata (held in Kolkata &amp; Delhi), Econophysics Colloquium, ESHIA/ WEHIA.

In recent years network science, heavily reliant on analogies from statistical mechanics, has been applied to the study of productive systems. That is the case with the works done at the Santa Fe Institute in European Funded Research Projects as Forecasting Financial Crises and the Harvard-MIT Observatory of Economic Complexity

==Basic tools==

Basic tools of econophysics are probabilistic and statistical methods often taken from statistical physics.

Physics models that have been applied in economics include the kinetic theory of gas (called the kinetic exchange models of markets), percolation models, chaotic models developed to study cardiac arrest, and models with self-organizing criticality as well as other models developed for earthquake prediction. Moreover, there have been attempts to use the mathematical theory of complexity and information theory, as developed by many scientists among whom are Murray Gell-Mann and Claude E. Shannon, respectively.

For potential games, it has been shown that an emergence-producing equilibrium based on information via Shannon information entropy produces the same equilibrium measure (Gibbs measure from statistical mechanics) as a stochastic dynamical equation which represents noisy decisions, both of which are based on bounded rationality models used by economists. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem connects the two to establish a concrete correspondence of &quot;temperature&quot;, &quot;entropy&quot;, &quot;free potential/energy&quot;, and other physics notions to an economics system. The statistical mechanics model is not constructed a-priori - it is a result of a boundedly rational assumption and modeling on existing neoclassical models. It has been used to prove the &quot;inevitability of collusion&quot; result of Huw Dixon in a case for which the neoclassical version of the model does not predict collusion. Here the demand is increasing, as with Veblen goods, stock buyers with the &quot;hot hand&quot; fallacy preferring to buy more successful stocks and sell those that are less successful, or among short traders during a short squeeze as occurred with the WallStreetBets group&#x27;s collusion to drive up GameStop stock price in 2021.
Nobel laureate and founder of experimental economics Vernon L. Smith has used econophysics to model sociability via implementation of ideas in Humanomics. There, noisy decision making and interaction parameters that facilitate the social action responses of reward and punishment result in spin glass models identical to those in physics. 

Quantifiers derived from information theory were used in several papers by econophysicist Aurelio F. Bariviera and coauthors in order to assess the degree in the informational efficiency of stock markets. Zunino et al. use an innovative statistical tool in the financial literature: the complexity-entropy causality plane. This Cartesian representation establish an efficiency ranking of different markets and distinguish different bond market dynamics. It was found that more developed countries have stock markets with higher entropy and lower complexity, while those markets from emerging countries have lower entropy and higher complexity. Moreover, the authors conclude that the classification derived from the complexity-entropy causality plane is consistent with the qualifications assigned by major rating companies to the sovereign instruments. A similar study developed by Bariviera et al. explore the relationship between credit ratings and informational efficiency of a sample of corporate bonds of US oil and energy companies using also the complexity–entropy causality plane. They find that this classification agrees with the credit ratings assigned by Moody&#x27;s.

Another good example is random matrix theory, which can be used to identify the noise in financial correlation matrices. One paper has argued that this technique can improve the performance of portfolios, e.g., in applied in portfolio optimization.

The ideology of econophysics is embodied in the probabilistic economic theory and, on its basis, in the unified market theory.

There are also analogies between finance theory and diffusion theory. For instance, the Black–Scholes equation for option pricing is a diffusion-advection equation (see however for a critique of the Black–Scholes methodology). The Black–Scholes theory can be extended to provide an analytical theory of main factors in economic activities.

== Subfields ==
Various other tools from physics that have so far been used, such as fluid dynamics, classical mechanics and quantum mechanics (including so-called classical economy, quantum economics and quantum finance), and the Feynman–Kac formula of statistical mechanics.

=== Statistical mechanics ===

When mathematician Mark Kac attended a lecture by Richard Feynman he realized their work overlapped. Together they worked out a new approach to solving stochastic differential equations. Their approach is used to efficiently calculate solutions to the Black–Scholes equation to price options on stocks.

=== Quantum finance ===

Quantum statistical models have been successfully applied to finance by several groups of econophysicists using different approaches, but the origin of their success may not be due to quantum analogies.

=== Quantum economics ===

The editorial in the inaugural issue of the journal &quot;Quantum Economics and Finance&quot; says: &quot;Quantum economics and finance is the application of probability based on projective geometry—also known as quantum probability—to modelling in economics and finance. It draws on related areas such as quantum cognition, quantum game theory, quantum computing, and quantum physics.&quot; In his overview article in the same issue, David Orrell outlines how neoclassical economics benefited from the concepts of classical mechanics, and yet concepts of quantum mechanics &quot;apparently left economics untouched&quot;. He reviews different avenues for quantum economics, some of which he notes are contradictory, settling on &quot;quantum economics therefore needs to take a different kind of leaf from the book of quantum physics, by adopting quantum methods, not because they appear natural or elegant or come pre-approved by some higher authority or bear resemblance to something else, but because they capture in a useful way the most basic properties of what is being studied.&quot;

==Main results==
Econophysics is having some impacts on the more applied field of quantitative finance, whose scope and aims significantly differ from those of economic theory. Various econophysicists have introduced models for price fluctuations in physics of financial markets or original points of view on established models.

Presently, one of the main results of econophysics comprises the explanation of the &quot;fat tails&quot; in the distribution of many kinds of financial data as a universal self-similar scaling property (i.e. scale invariant over many orders of magnitude in the data), arising from the tendency of individual market competitors, or of aggregates of them, to exploit systematically and optimally the prevailing &quot;microtrends&quot; (e.g., rising or falling prices). These &quot;fat tails&quot; are not only mathematically important, because they comprise the risks, which may be on the one hand, very small such that one may tend to neglect them, but which - on the other hand - are not negligible at all, i.e. they can never be made exponentially tiny, but instead follow a measurable algebraically decreasing power law, for example with a &quot;failure probability&quot; of only formula_1 where &quot;x&quot; is an increasingly large variable in the tail region of the distribution considered (i.e. a price statistics with much more than 108 data). I.e., the events considered are not simply &quot;outliers&quot; but must really be taken into account and cannot be &quot;insured away&quot;. It appears that it also plays a role that near a change of the tendency (e.g. from falling to rising prices) there are typical &quot;panic reactions&quot; of the selling or buying agents with algebraically increasing bargain rapidities and volumes.

As in quantum field theory the &quot;fat tails&quot; can be obtained by complicated &quot;nonperturbative&quot; methods, mainly by numerical ones, since they contain the deviations from the usual Gaussian approximations, e.g. the Black–Scholes theory. Fat tails can, however, also be due to other phenomena, such as a random number of terms in the central-limit theorem, or any number of other, non-econophysics models. Due to the difficulty in testing such models, they have received less attention in traditional economic analysis.

==Criticism==
In 2006 economists Mauro Gallegati, Steve Keen, Thomas Lux, and Paul Ormerod, published a critique of econophysics. They cite important empirical contributions primarily in the areas of finance and industrial economics, but list four concerns with work in the field: lack of awareness of economics work, resistance to rigor, a misplaced belief in universal empirical regularity, and inappropriate models.

<text>The Queen Margaret Union (QMU) is one of two students&#x27; unions at the University of Glasgow, Scotland. Founded in 1890, it caters to the social and cultural needs of its members by providing a range of services including volunteering opportunities, entertainment, catering, bars and games.

==History==
The Queen Margaret Union was founded in 1890 by students of the Queen Margaret College, both named after Saint Margaret of Scotland, a Queen Consort of Scotland, in the West End of Glasgow to provide an outlet for their social and cultural needs.

The QMU operated in the basement rooms of the college until 1906, when the expansion of the college meant that the space was needed for teaching. A bazaar was held by the Board of Management (comprising elected students) to raise money to erect and furnish a union building to house the Union. The bazaar was held over four days and featured a number of stalls selling many different items from clothes to pieces of furniture. Although the funds were raised, a building was never created for the Union to occupy.
After a few years of trying to decide how best to spend the money, a house at 31 Buckingham Terrace was rented. In 1912, the College Club at the University of Glasgow went into liquidation and the QMU took over the premises at 67 Ann Street (now Southpark Terrance) until 1922 when it moved across the road from the Glasgow University Union (GUU, which only admitted men) in the John McIntyre Building, to be based at 1 University Gardens (left, now part of the Department of History). During this period, the QM Union mostly provided space for its members to study, discuss, debate and eat.

In 1932, as the Men&#x27;s Union grew in size and had a building built at the bottom of Gilmorehill, its previous home in the John McIntyre Building was given to the QM Union. At this time in its history the QMU was beginning to explore, rather successfully, in the world of university debating. Men and other delegates were allowed to attend but only as &quot;distinguished strangers&quot;, who sat in a separate gallery. Other facilities included a library, dining room, study space, and cubicles so that members who lived at home the city centre could stay over after public transport had ended.

The building became inadequate to provide for the University of Glasgow&#x27;s growing female population. In 1968, a building at 22 University Gardens was built to accommodate the then so-called, &quot;Q-Emma’s&quot;. The women of the QMU were often involved in the debating circuit and especially in Rectorial elections and campaigns at the university.

However, the division of the sexes at Glasgow became more questioned with the passing of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. The two unions had an agreement allowing reciprocal use of much of each other&#x27;s facilities, but the QMU allowed men to use the bulk of its facilities with a few restrictions, while the GUU confined women only to its extension. As the 1970s came to a close, several men had requested to join the QMU. Consequently, it held a general meeting in 1979 and changed its constitution to allow men to become members. The GUU allowed women members one year later. Over 99% of the huge attendance at that EGM accepted the amendment.

A fire in 1982 shut the building for several months and sparked nearly a decade of financial problems for the Union. However, between 1989 and 1992, effective management and prudent financial control saw the Union become financially solvent once again.

===Modern day===
The early 1990s saw the QMU stage Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, Garbage and Belle &amp; Sebastian. This continued with bands such as Coldplay, Biffy Clyro and Franz Ferdinand playing on the same stage in the 2000s. And in 2016, Troye Sivan performed at the venue marking his first visit to Scotland on his blue neighbourhood tour.

The late 1990s until the early 2000s saw the QMU redevelop many of its social and commercial areas, including all of its bars. Other recent notable events at the QMU have included supporting Charles Kennedy in his successful campaign to become Rector.

In 2007 and 2009, , the QMU&#x27;s member-run fortnightly publication, won the Best Magazine Award at &quot;The Herald&quot; Scottish Student Press Awards. It was shortlisted in 2006, 2008 and 2010. In 2010 Ruaraidh J MacIntyre, &#x27;s resident columnist won the &#x27;Best Columnist&#x27; award at the Herald Student Press Awards.

The Union was again faced with financial difficulty in the 2000s as a result of the University of Glasgow cutting the block grant – the money annually supplied to both unions – by around half. This, exacerbated by the Financial crisis of 2007–08, meant the Union saw several consecutive years of financial loss. Responding to these financial difficulties, work by successive boards of management to engage with University management led to parity of funding with the Glasgow University Union for the first time in 2010 and the subsequent reinstatement of the block grant in 2011. However, many changes in the tastes, lifestyles and expectations of students have left the Queen Margaret Union - and many other student unions - facing severe problems.

During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, the Union came under criticism from a trade union and the University Rector for making 31 members of part-time staff unemployed. The decision was made prior the Government announcing the furlough scheme, which led to the Board of Management voting to reinstate staff until the end of their contracts.

==Relationship with other student organisations==
There are two Unions at the University of Glasgow with some students choosing to join both of them during, and after, Freshers&#x27; week. In 2003–2004, both Unions attempted to change their Constitutions to allow for Automatic Joint Student Membership. 

The University of Glasgow is not affiliated to the National Union of Students (NUS), with the QMU instead being part of Northern Services, a purchasing consortium set up by the students unions of Edinburgh. In 2006, a referendum was held to ask the students of the university whether it should affiliate with the NUS, during which the QMU formed part of the &quot;No to NUS&quot; campaign.

==Governance==
===Board of Management===
The QMU is run by a student Board of Management bi-annually elected by the membership. The names of the Presidents of the Union are preserved on a board in the main stairwell of the Union and photographs of each entire Board of Management are taken at the start of their term of office and displayed on the walls of the Board Room.

The Board is divided into three distinct parts. The Executive comprises the offices of President, and two Vice Presidents (Vice President: Membership, Clubs and Societies and Vice President: Board of Management) and are charged with the day-to-day running of the union and maintaining a high level of discipline, member and clubs and societies involvement and representing the union externally. They oversee every event, operation and campaign within the Union, and also act as trustees.

The Convenors are each responsible for an aspect of the unions&#x27; activity. The convenors are Campaigns and Charities Convenor, Events Convenor, Publications Convenor, Social Convenor, Tech Convenor and Mental Health and Welfare Convenor. They each chair a committee of Union members, as described below.

The largest section of the board is that of the Current Student Representatives. The &#x27;CSR Committee&#x27; is composed of twelve elected students, at least three of whom are in their first year of study, who are largely free to involve themselves with whatever aspects of the union they see fit. A Convenor of Current Student Representatives (CCSR) is elected from amongst them to represent the committee as a whole to the Executive and Convenors.

In addition to this, the Board of Management contains two Former Student Members, the Past President, Honorary President and two Honorary Vice Presidents. 

===Committees===
The Board of Management is fed ideas through a committee structure. Committee meetings can be attended by any member of the Union, and active committees in 2022 are:

Events: The Events Committee assist the planning and running of all QM-run events that take place in the Union.

Tech Team: The Tech Team are involved with the practicalities of running the QM&#x27;s events, including lighting and sound tech.

Social: The Social Committee are concerned with the planning and execution of the (almost-daily) events that take place every day in Bar - one of the Union&#x27;s three bars - from pub quizzes and acoustic nights to comedy and new theatre drawn from the students of the University of Glasgow.

Publications: The Publications Committee are responsible for all Union publications, namely the production and distribution of qmunicate magazine, the Union&#x27;s in-house news and views magazine.

Campaigns: The Campaigns Committee oversee all Union fundraising and campaigns. Fundraising for local, national and international charities and campaigning for wider causes has been an integral part of the Queen Margaret Union for many years.

Welfare: The Welfare Committee are involved in planning events and campaigns to help with students mental health such as de-stress days.

<doc id="664337" wikidata="Q3563757" url="?curid=664337" title="Anacostia station">
<text>Anacostia station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green Line. The station is located in the Anacostia neighborhood of Southeast Washington, with entrances at Shannon Place and Howard Road near Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE (a major street serving the southeastern portion of the city). The station serves as a hub for Metrobus routes in Southeast, Washington, D.C., and Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland.

== Station layout ==
The architecture at Anacostia is unusual. Due to cost considerations and the station&#x27;s shallow depth, the usual arched ceiling was abandoned in favor of flat concrete walls and a ceiling of small barrel vaults (oriented perpendicular to the tracks) similar to the upper coffers in the six-coffer arch station design. The station is an underground stop because the distance between the Anacostia River tunnels and the station is too short to have permitted an above-ground stop. The station has entrances on both sides of DC-295/I-295 (Anacostia Freeway), which necessitated the construction of a slightly longer platform than would be necessary to accommodate trains. In addition, there are no pylons at platform-level at Anacostia.

Because of a 1978 consent decree between Metro and a coalition of handicapped persons&#x27; advocacy groups, the Anacostia Metro station was one of three originally planned Metrorail stations to have at least two elevators when it opened (the other two being Friendship Heights and Forest Glen), though some original stations have gained additional elevators through station renovations and expansions.

===Streetcar service===

The Metro station was slated to have a transfer to a stop on the Anacostia Line of the DC Streetcar trolley system. However, in August 2010 construction on the Anacostia Streetcar Line was halted after District of Columbia Department of Transportation (DDOT) officials ordered construction shut down after city officials refused to extend the construction contract or give a new contract to another firm.

=== Artwork ===

The station also contains a work of public art which reflects on the history and culture of the community. &quot;River Spirits of the Anacostia&quot; is a glass mosaic tile frieze completed in 2004 by Martha Jackson-Jarvis. 
The mosaic, () is placed along the roof-line of the Metro station and depicts the aquatic life of the river showing fish, plants, birds and other wildlife of the Anacostia River. 
The work was commissioned by way of a contest by the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities.

==History==

===Controversy over building the Green Line===
====Master plan====
Metro drew up its original master plan for its planned system in 1968. At that time, a Green Line was planned to pass through some of the area&#x27;s poorest and most transit-dependent neighborhoods and provide them with subway service. The southern part of the Green Line was originally to pass over the 11th Street Bridges to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE. The line was originally scheduled to open in 1976. The site of the Anacostia station, set for the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue and Good Hope Road SE, led to concerns that the station would destroy historic Old Anacostia, and after pressure from the federal government Metro moved the site of the station to Howard Road SE. By the end of 1977, Metro had pushed the opening of the Green Line to June 1983. Increasing construction costs and financing problems (primarily caused by the inability of local governments to contribute their share of Metro&#x27;s funding) led Metro to consider whether to shift the Green Line to a more southerly route along Wheeler Road SE to terminate near Rosecroft Raceway.

In January 1978, a Metro regional task force approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway (with a new station added near St. Elizabeths Hospital). But the Prince George&#x27;s County government demanded in May 1978 that Metro choose the Suitland Parkway-to-Rosecroft route instead, a change Metro agreed to. Metro announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on this portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia. Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension to Anacostia station by late 1983.

====1980 troubles and near-cancellation====
Funding troubles delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials worried that high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds to complete the Green Line, forcing Maryland to pay these construction costs alone. These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget. By then, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.

In October 1980, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ran a major article asking &quot;What Ever Happened to the Green Line?&quot; in which the newspaper concluded: &quot;The Green Line, which some argue should have been the first built because it would serve the most disadvantaged sections of the Washington area, is last on the construction list and threatened with extinction.&quot; The article confirmed that funds were in place and contracts signed to complete the Green Line to the proposed Anacostia Station at Howard Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, but that repeated local opposition in Maryland to the line&#x27;s actual location had forced planners to delay final siting of the line inside the District of Columbia. Additionally, Maryland businessmen argued that the switch of the terminus from Branch Avenue to Rosecroft Raceway had economically harmed them, and they filed a suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland demanding a halt to construction of the Green Line until the line&#x27;s route could be again reconsidered.

====Legal and funding battles====
In December 1978, Metro announced that cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at the Anacostia station. In late 1978 and 1979, a controversy erupted over parking at the planned station. In 1978, Metro proposed building a 2,000-space parking lot on the west side of the Anacostia Freeway. Angry residents, protesting the amount of traffic which would come into their residential neighborhood, forced Metro to reduce the size of the parking lot to 1,300 spaces. In January 1979, Metro proposed building a 500-space parking garage at the proposed Anacostia station, and adding another 800 temporary spaces by paving over a part of Anacostia Park (to be removed once additional parking was built at the terminus of the Green Line at Rosecroft). But residents resisted this plan as well on the grounds that too much traffic would clog local streets. (These concerns were resolved in March 1980.) By July 1979, despite the release of billions of dollars in construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed the construction of the Anacostia station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue Line to late 1986. But construction deadlines continued to slip. Despite reaffirming its Branch Avenue Line construction deadlines in December 1979, in January 1980 Metro announced that completion of the Green Line terminus would be pushed back six more months to 1987. In January 1981, Metro admitted that the station would not open until 1990 because of funding constraints.

Controversies regarding the siting of the Green Line continued, however. In May 1980, a group of business owners sued Metro on the grounds that the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro&#x27;s rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland ruled against Metro, Metro&#x27;s appeal failed, and on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money on the construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. District residents also protested the siting of the route. Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) 6C (an elected local governmental body advising the District government on neighborhood issues) asked Metro to move the Anacostia Metro station from its proposed location on Howard Road between Firth Sterling Avenue SE and Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Anacostia Drive SE. In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Anacostia station to early 1988. Metro estimated on December 9, 1981, that the Anacostia station would open in late 1989.

====Federal delays====
Construction of the Anacostia station was also delayed by a land controversy involving the federal government. Metro planned to tunnel under the Anacostia River to connect the Anacostia station with the proposed Navy Yard station, but the south end of the tunnel would have required the relocation of a plant nursery maintained by the federal government to provide Congress with flowers and trees. Because the nursery was on federally owned land, moving it required an Act of Congress. The District of Columbia agreed to provide $29 million in federally provided highway funds to move the nursery (arguing that the land would be used to build a parking garage and lot for use by commuters using the Anacostia station), but the Federal Highway Administration ruled the funds could not be used for this purpose. The delay threatened to push the station&#x27;s opening to 1990, and some officials worried that by then funds to build the Green Line would have run out. Metro proposed moving the nursery to Camp Simms, a former U.S. Army campground in the Congress Heights neighborhood. But construction on the Green Line was suspended for nearly two years due to federal budget cuts (see below), and in March 1983 the Architect of the Capitol agreed to move the nursery to a parcel of land in the Bellevue neighborhood. The United States House of Representatives and United States Senate passed legislation approving the move in March and June 1984, respectively.

But even as the nursery resiting issue was resolved, funding problems delayed construction on the station. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard station.

In October 1982, Metro estimated that opening of the Green Line to Anacostia would happen in the &quot;late 1980s,&quot; and in November the Metro staff report recommended construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route.

More cuts in federal construction funds for Metro further delayed construction of the Anacostia station. Metro announced in December 1982 that the station would not open until late 1989 at the earliest. Metro, for the first time in its history, formally announced that (absent full construction funding) it could not build the Green Line, the Red Line from Wheaton to Glenmont, or the Yellow Line from Franconia-Springfield to King Street–Old Town.

====District court appeal====
As Metro struggled to secure construction funding for the Green Line and Anacostia station, it also struggled to lift the district court&#x27;s injunction on Green Line construction. Metro asked the court to allow construction of the Navy Yard, Anacostia and Congress Heights stations pending a decision on the Green Line route in Prince George&#x27;s County, but the court refused. More than 23,000 Anacostia residents signed a public petition demanding that the line be built. Metro declined to appeal Judge Ramsey&#x27;s latest ruling. Frustrated by funding constraints and the court injunction, Metro released a proposed &quot;final&quot; system map in December 1983 which showed the Green Line terminating at the Anacostia and Mount Vernon Square stations.

====Resolution of controversies====
Metro opened negotiations with Prince George&#x27;s County officials in 1984 to win their approval to build the Green Line from the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. After four days of negotiations, Metro, D.C. and Prince George&#x27;s County officials reached an agreement to begin construction of the Green Line from L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to Anacostia, pending resolution of the line&#x27;s final route by December 6, 1984. The agreement called for construction of the Green Line to Waterfront Station in the summer, siting of the tunnel under the Anacostia River by June 28, and the holding of public hearings on the remaining route between July 18 and August 3. The U.S. federal district court approved the agreement on March 7. Following the ruling, Metro announced that it would build the Anacostia station on Howard Road between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Freeway as well as a new Metro station at the Washington Navy Yard and open the Green Line by 1990. Metro asked and won approval from the court to build the Navy Yard and Anacostia stations and the tunnel in mid-June 1984.

Metro also began new political efforts to secure funding to complete the transit system. Initially, Reagan administration officials balked at this plan, reiterating that they would not permit Metro to build more than of subway. But in June, House and Senate committees passed legislation requiring the Reagan administration to release all funds appropriated for Metro, putting pressure on the administration to rescind its limit.

===Constructing the Green Line and Anacostia===
Metro issued a call for bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River in July 1984, and awarded the $25.6 million contract to the firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) in December 1984. The debate over the route for the remainder of the Green Line was finally resolved in December 1984 when the original route was re-selected. The U.S. district court approved Metro&#x27;s decision. Funding for Green Line construction fell into place in 1985. Construction on the line started in 1985. Survey and clearing work for the twin Anacostia River tunnels began in March 1985. The completion date for the two tunnels was estimated at late 1987.

====Parking garage problems====
A major controversy over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well. In 1981, Metro had proposed building 1,000 parking spaces in a three-level parking garage and 300 spaces at a ground-level parking lot at the station and using interstate highway funds to pay for them. Metro officials argued the facility was highway-related, since it provided parking, but the Federal Highway Administration refused to allow the District of Columbia use its funds to pay for the parking garage. Local citizens also opposed the parking garage in favor of ground-level-only parking at the station, and demanded that Metro provide more connecting bus routes at the proposed station. These disagreements were put off as Metro officials and others focused on getting the Green Line built, but by 1985 the parking garage remained part of the station&#x27;s overall transportation and construction plan. Metro solicited bids for an $11 million contract to build the parking garage in early 1985, but rejected all bids when the lowest bidder failed to meet minority-contracting standards. In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on the parking garage would begin in June.

In a second round of bidding, the winning contractor met the standard, but the cost of the parking garage had now risen by $900,000 to $11.9 million. But the second winning bid was also rejected after transit officials said they inadvertently misstated minority-contracting and minimum wage standards in the contracting process.

Metro relaxed its minority-contracting requirement from 35 percent to 25 percent, and after a third round of bidding awarded a $12.6 million contract for the parking garage to the Kiewit Construction Co. The bid was more than $1.6 million higher than the rejected second-round bid. Construction on the three-level parking structure was well under way by April 1986.

====Station construction====
Metro&#x27;s board awarded a $41.5 million contract for the construction of the Anacostia station to Kiewit Construction Co. in June 1985, and said the station would open in 1990. Ground was broken at the site on September 21, 1985. A significant number of prehistoric artifacts were found during the station&#x27;s excavation. Rubble from the station&#x27;s construction was dumped on the south side of Good Hope Road SE between 24th Street SE and Altamont Place SE (where the Woodmont Crossing housing project was built in 2002). Exit 3B (Howard Road) on southbound I-295 was closed to construct Anacostia station, blocking traffic from reaching South Capitol Street. Although above-ground construction ended in late 1989, the exit remained closed until December 1991 so that its reopening would coincide with the Anacostia station opening. In July 1991, Metro paid an additional $1 million to install stronger escalator treads at the nine planned Green Line stations (including Anacostia) as well as the Wheaton and Van Dorn Street stations after discovering that the escalator treads it had ordered were insufficiently strong.

Funding for construction of the station and the Green Line was threatened again in 1986, but lengthy negotiations and heavy pressure from Congress led to the release of $400 million on July 16, 1986. Construction proceeded quickly thereafter. On March 23, 1986, the second of the two , concrete-lined tunnels under the Anacostia River was completed. In December 1988, Metro reaffirmed that the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations would open in late 1991.

The first Metro budget which contained funds for operating the Green Line was proposed in December 1989, and it requested funds to test the soon-to-open Green Line from Gallery Place-Chinatown to the Anacostia station. The budget also projected that the Green Line from Gallery Place-Chinatown to the Anacostia station would open in 1991, and that new Metrobus service will be added in Prince George&#x27;s County to bring commuters to the new station. The cost of testing and operating the Green Line left Metro struggling financially. These costs (along with costs associated with extending and operating the Blue Line to Van Dorn Street) forced Metro to cut 335 jobs as well as supplies, travel, overtime and temporary employee budgets. Although ridership was projected to rise 3.8 percent to 260 million trips in the coming year, the increased revenue was not expected to cover the costs of operating the new lines and stations.

===Station opening===

The , , and stations opened in May 1991.

Metro announced on September 6, 1991, that the Green Line from L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to Anacostia would open on December 28, 1991. Only 983 parking spaces would be available at the station upon its opening (673 of them in the parking garage). One hundred and fifty Anacostia residents rode a special preview train along the line on December 21.

The Green Line from to Anacostia opened on schedule at 8:00 AM on December 28. The $286 million extension added to the rail system. Although Metro had estimated in September 1991 that 60,000 riders would board daily at the three stations, this number had fallen to just 30,700 riders a day by early December 1991 and to just 28,000 on December 28. Metro estimated 20,000 riders a day would board at Anacostia station alone by late June 1992. Fearing a boycott of the station due to ongoing disputes over bus service in Anacostia (see below), Metro sent large numbers of extra station managers and supervisors into the Anacostia station on the first workday it was open to help commuters decide whether to take rail or bus, and which bus routes to take. Metro said 1,854 people boarded at Anacostia, 459 boarded at Waterfront, and 127 boarded at Navy Yard on the first workday.

====Ridership====
Ridership continued to expand rapidly on the Green Line. In the first workweek of the year, more than 8,000 riders a day boarded at the three stations (more than 5,000 of them at Anacostia), exceeding Metro&#x27;s estimates. Although nearly 10,000 riders were boarding each day at the three stations by the third week of January, Metro nonetheless handed out free rail passes (the first free rail pass giveaway in the transit agency&#x27;s history) to customers at the three stations to encourage ridership. By March 1992, the number of weekday riders had risen to nearly 11,000 per day at Anacostia station alone.

====Parking====
Initially, parking at the Anacostia station was low. Only an average of 275 people parked each day at the station&#x27;s parking garage and parking lot by March 1992. To encourage parking, in April 1992 Metro offered half-price parking coupons to encourage commuters to use the Anacostia parking spaces. Metro also held public hearings in Maryland to learn why commuters did not use the lot; crime was the highest concern. The campaign worked, and by November 1992 the lot was nearly full every weekday. In July 1993, District of Columbia officials canceled plans to build a $5.4 million ground-level parking lot at the Anacostia Metro station. The unused funds sat idle until 2004, when the District of Columbia finally used them to improve traffic signals, lighting, and pedestrian access along South Capitol Street between E Street SE and the Anacostia Metro station, and for the design of a new Frederick Douglass Memorial Bridge.

====Extension====
In 1995, Metro broke ground on the Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights stations, a $900 million project which would complete the final of the originally planned Metrorail system in late 1999. The Green Line&#x27;s final five stations opened on January 13, 2001.

====Controversy====
Two major controversies, one over buses and one over the number of rail cars servicing the Green Line, occurred when the station opened.

====Bus controversy====
Like all Metro stations, the Anacostia station was intended to be a major hub for Metrobus service in its area. But with the Anacostia neighborhood being the poorest and most transit-dependent area in the District of Columbia, changes to bus routes in the area proved highly controversial.

As the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia neared, Metro proposed halving the number of bus routes traveling between Anacostia and the National Archives Building downtown—forcing riders to take the more expensive Metrorail and requiring many riders to walk several blocks to their destination (rather than the &quot;virtually door-to-door service&quot; they currently enjoyed). A total of 25 routes were changed, affecting more than 80,000 riders. Many of the new routes were designed to terminate at the Anacostia station rather than continue into downtown Washington, as they once had.

Metro officials admitted that fares for most Anacostia residents would rise an average of 50 percent, and that Anacostia residents would be forced to pay more and travel farther to access the services (such as doctors) and shopping most District residents had ready access to. To help mitigate the impact of the total fare increase on Anacostia residents, Metro reduced basic bus fares for many routes in the area from $1 to 35 cents. District residents protested the cuts with a picket line in front of Metro&#x27;s downtown headquarters in late August 1991. Prince George&#x27;s County residents, too, were angered by the bus route changes, arguing that Metro had promised more (not less) bus service and complaining that they would be forced to use a rail station located in the District of Columbia&#x27;s most violent and crime-prone neighborhoods. More than 1,000 people packed &quot;raucous&quot; public hearings for three nights in the District and Prince George&#x27;s County in early September, denouncing Metro and claiming they were &quot;becoming a victim of transportational apartheid.&quot;

Worried about the impact of the cuts as well as a possible bus boycott, D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon announced on September 11, 1991, that she would seek an alternative to the changes proposed by Metro. But suburban commuters were angry that Metro would keep the bus routes open in Anacostia (at an estimated cost of $4 million) when their bus service had been cut at the time Metrorail stations opened in their areas. But D.C. residents countered that poor African American District citizens could ill-afford the same transit changes and fare increases that wealthy, white suburbanites were asked to absorb. Calls for a boycott increased in mid-September. On September 16, 1991, declaring that the city paid &quot;40 percent of the Metro subsidy, but we&#x27;re the last to get service,&quot; Mayor Dixon threatened to withhold the District&#x27;s payment to Metro unless the bus changes were rescinded. Metro officials were angered by Dixon&#x27;s statement, saying District officials had been involved in the bus route planning process for months. Mayor Dixon proposed on September 20 that Metro continue to use the Anacostia station as a hub, but also continue bus service into downtown D.C. The plan (estimated to cost less than $500,000 a year) would require residents to transfer at Anacostia station but would not raise the total fare to more than $1. A month later, Metro&#x27;s board of directors unanimously agreed to accept Dixon&#x27;s plan, and cancelled all planned route changes in the District of Columbia and Prince George&#x27;s County.

The cost of operating the bus routes totaled $2.5 million. Prince George&#x27;s County, meanwhile, also announced that its county-run buses (&quot;The Bus&quot;) would not run to Anacostia station as previously promised either, drawing outrage from D.C.&#x27;s representatives on Metro&#x27;s board. The District of Columbia had spent more than $20 million adding bus bays at the station to accommodate The Bus arrivals. The compromise led residents to call off their boycott of Metrobus.

Two months after the Anacostia station opened, Metro said that a study of bus and rail ridership showed that the unaltered bus routes were costing the transit agency $200,000 a month in lost rail fares. To make up the lost revenue, Metro said it would run only two-car trains on the Green Line during slow periods weekdays and evenings and on Sundays beginning in June 1992. In November 1992, Metro reported that ridership at the Anacostia station was (on average) 7,500 riders a day, 700 below estimates. Metro admitted that although riders had made the switch from bus to rail, the lower ridership numbers due to the recession and not because of continuing bus service in the area. Metro said ridership on buses in the neighborhood was down significantly, and the transit agency reduced the number of buses on some routes to avoid having empty buses.

====Bus conditions====
Metro also encountered controversy over its plan to upgrade the conditions of the buses in the Anacostia area. A Metro survey in April 1991 found that the 75,000 bus riders in Anacostia were forced to use the dirtiest and most poorly maintained buses operated by the transit agency. Metro also admitted that although it had sent new buses to Southeast in 1983, the buses suffered from a high rate of breakdowns. Metro blamed the problem on its outdated and undersized bus garage at South Capitol and M Streets SE, and proposed building a new, much larger bus garage near the Anacostia Metro station for $30 million to $35 million. Metro originally planned for the bus garage to be built near the new Anacostia station, where many of the routes the buses ran terminated. But D.C. officials balked at that site (arguing the land should be used for development and would cost Metro an extra $3 million a year for 50 years to operate), and asked Metro to build a new bus garage at the site of the existing garage on M Street SE. Metro refused to budget money for that project, arguing that the Metro did not have the $40 million needed to buy additional land at the M Street site. In retaliation, D.C.&#x27;s representatives on Metro&#x27;s board of directors vetoed funding for 16 of Metro&#x27;s projects. The District of Columbia rezoned the land near the Anacostia station for commercial use in mid-1993, hoping to spur development in the area and prevent Metro from using the site for the bus garage. Washington Gas offered to lease in southeast Washington to Metro for the bus garage, but concerns over the $26 million cleanup costs for coal tar pollution at the site led to the rejection of this proposal.

===Station operation===

The Anacostia station has had relatively few maintenance issues during its lifetime. In 1997, the station&#x27;s escalators suffered repeated breakdown, as did escalators throughout the Metrorail system, due to poor maintenance.

Parking at the station was originally difficult to find, but availability has improved over time. By July 1997, the parking garage at the Anacostia station was usually full by 9 A.M. on a weekday. But after the Green Line&#x27;s final five stations opened in January 2001, the parking garage at the Anacostia station became underused. Ten years into its operation, the parking garage required refurbishing, but Metro put the project off for a year to pay for other projects. The parking garage was one of 13 in the Metro system which had no waiting list for long-term parking as of February 2004. Its parking garage still did not fill up on workdays as of March 2005.

The station plays a key role in Metro operations. In October 1997, Metro announced that it would use sidings located near the Anacostia station for storing extra trains whenever major public events downtown (such as Capitals or Wizards games at the Capital One Arena) required extra train service.

====Experiments====
The Anacostia station has been used several times for experiments in improving Metrorail&#x27;s operations. In July 1997, Anacostia was one of five Metrorail stations used to test a premium monthly parking fee which would guarantee the purchaser a spot at the station&#x27;s parking garage. The $50-a-month pass was the most popular at Anacostia, and the pricing scheme was expanded throughout the Metro system in March 1998. Although Metro reserved on 15 percent of all spaces for such parking at most stations, at Anacostia this was raised to 25 percent. In March 1999, Metro tested a new emergency call box system at Anacostia and two other Metrorail stations. When Metro established a carsharing program with Flexcar in 2001, the Anacostia station was one of 12 Metrorail stations at which the system was tested. Metro also tested its &quot;Next Bus&quot; real-time information system (designed to let riders know how long they have to wait for the bus) at Anacostia and four other Metrorail stations. Technical problems and funding issues delayed implementation of the project on a wider scale. Metro relaunched the system in June 2009, and once more Metrobus &quot;Next Bus&quot; signs were activated at Anacostia and two other pilot Metrorail stations. When Metro announced a pilot program in the spring of 2006 to encourage food and other vendors to sell goods in Metrorail stations, Anacostia was one of 12 stations chosen for the test. The program stalled due to cleanliness, safety, and other concerns, but was reinvigorated in 2009, and Anacostia was one of three Metrorail stations chosen again to experiment with the initiative. When Metro adopted the SmarTrip fare care program the same year, Anacostia was one of three stations chosen to experiment with SmarTrip fare gate express lanes. The express lane program was canceled when too few riders used the express lanes. Anacostia was also one of six parking garages and lots where Metro experimented with accepting credit card payments rather than SmarTrip cards in 2007. Anacostia was also one of eight Metro stations which first sold SmarTrip cards in 2008.

====Rail car shortage====

Service at the Anacostia station and along the entire Green Line was hampered during the station&#x27;s first decade by a severe shortage of rail cars. Metro first became aware of a rail car shortage in 1988 (at the time, there were only 666 railcars of 1000-, 2000-, and 3000- series rolling stock in the entire system; these comprised the entire system&#x27;s fleet in 1988), but did little to resolve the issue.

Metro also encountered significant problems estimating the number of riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations. In December 1991, when the Anacostia Station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992). Just a week later, Metro dropped that estimate to only 28,000 riders a day (by June 1992).

Even though significant numbers of bus riders in Anacostia had switched to Metrorail by February 1992, WMATA nonetheless began running two- rather than four-car trains on the Green Line on Sundays and during slow periods in order to close a revenue shortfall.

Metro finally ordered new 5000-series rail cars, but the first of the cars were not due to be delivered until February 2001.

The December 2000 opening of the final five Green Line stations (Branch Avenue, Suitland, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Congress Heights) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the Green Line. The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train passed them filled. Metro had estimated that 18,000 riders a day would board from these stations by June 2001. That estimate was exceeded by 2,000 riders a day on the second day the stations were open.

By January 24, the number had risen to more than 30,600 per day—three times as many as originally estimated. Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints. Metro claimed a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: The system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule, which was well before 192 new 5000-series rail cars were ready for service; and Metro offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 riders, 300% of the expected 4,000, to the line.

==Crime at Anacostia==

=== Early incidents ===
Since the 1980s, Anacostia has been long been synonymous with crime and violence, and has one of the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not in all crimes). Concern about crime on the Green Line stations in southeast D.C. (Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue) have existed for a long time, although statistics only partially support these concerns.

The first reported incident of crime at the Anacostia station occurred during the station&#x27;s construction. Three teenagers broke into the construction site on July 7, 1989; stole tools; and broke the glass on the cab of a crane before being arrested. Concern about crime at the station led Metro to station additional transit police officers at Anacostia station in the weeks after the station&#x27;s opening, and D.C. police patrolled the station&#x27;s parking garage. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why Prince George&#x27;s County residents fought bus route changes in 1991 which would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia station.

Concerns about crime at the station initially appeared justified. The first reported crime at Anacostia station occurred on February 5, 1992, just six weeks after the station opened. A man was accosted by three teenagers at about 9:25 P.M. at the station, kidnapped at gunpoint, and forced to strip naked. The youths took clothing, a watch, and $7 from him, and were caught by police while trying to flee the scene of the crime. In its first year of operation, Anacostia tied with the Capitol Heights station for the most auto thefts (17), and accounted for 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations. By 2005, large crowds of middle and high school students began congregating at the station, brawling and robbing Metro riders and creating a public safety issue. In November 2005, Metro and the District of Columbia Public Schools entered into an agreement to bus students from Anacostia High School directly to the station rather than have them walk or take Metrobus to the station. Metro Transit Police officers, some accompanied by dogs, began patrolling Anacostia station along with six other Metro stations, to increase awareness of police presences in the stations and deter crime. The police presence did not appear to help: Between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased to 295 from 156, and warnings increased 40 percent. Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue. Metro even created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro&#x27;s police division.

=== Trends ===
Crime continued to be a problem at the Anacostia station late into the first decade of the 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007, and Metro Transit Police established a system-wide crime prevention and awareness program to help reduce crime. Although Anacostia was one of the ten Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), it had no auto thefts or break-ins. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at the 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence even further in September 2008 at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.

But crime on Metro as a whole was rising in the late 2000s. Historically, Metro has had a significantly lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States. But crime on the transit system began spiking in 2008 and 2009. Robbery rose by 30 percent to 581 incidents in 2008, and in the first four months of 2009 rose another 28.3 percent to 240 robberies. But Anacostia was no longer the station with the most robberies; Gallery Place-Chinatown had 30 percent more robberies than Anacostia (the next-highest station was L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, with 20 percent fewer than Anacostia). Nonetheless, juvenile crime (assault and robbery) continued to be a serious issue for Metro, with more than 260 juvenile arrests in the first nine months of 2009 and Metro Transit Police continuing to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols. Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place-Chinatown, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and Metro added Metro Center to the list as well.

=== Notable crimes ===

Notable crimes committed at the Anacostia station include:
:*February 5, 1992: A man was accosted by three teenagers at about 9:25 P.M., kidnapped at gunpoint, and forced to strip naked on a nearby street. The youths took clothing, a watch, and $7 from him, and were caught by police while trying to flee the scene of the crime.
:*March 30, 2004: Two men began arguing inside the Anacostia station. One of the men, 29-year-old Bradley Gant, boarded an idling Metrobus. The other man opened fire on the bus with a handgun, shooting Gant in the chest and killing him. The assailant fled and has not been captured as of December 2009.
:*November 17, 2007: 25-year-old Timothy Spicer was carjacked at about 9:10 P.M. near the entrance to the Anacostia station parking garage. He was shot multiple times, pushed from his vehicle, and died a few hours later. In February 2018, Maurice Blakey pled guilty to second degree murder while armed for shooting Mr. Spicer in the back, and was sentenced to a 22 year prison term. Mr. Blakey had two look-outs, Joseph Minor and Randolph Williams. Mr. Minor pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter while armed and was sentenced to 8.5 years to run consecutively to a 47 year prison term he is serving for another murder. Mr. Williams pled guilty to second degree murder. Kadeem Quarles was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in the murder of Mr. Spicer in October 2018.
:*June 18, 2008: A Metrobus driver received a gunshot wound to the head at 12:45 P.M. from a stray bullet during a shootout between two teenagers near the Anacostia station. Both juveniles were also wounded. D.C. police arrested both youths inside the station.
:*February 15, 2009: A teenager was shot and wounded inside the Anacostia station at about 12:20 A.M. The teen was allegedly part of a group which boarded the Green Line at the Gallery Place-Chinatown Station. A dispute with another group of teens and young adults broke out. The victim left the train at the Anacostia station, and was shot on the platform. Two Metro Transit Police officers gave chase and captured the alleged assailant (an adult).

==Economic development==
Metrorail has often been viewed as an important factor in spurring economic development in the D.C. metropolitan region.

However, the Green Line has brought relatively minimal economic development to the area around the Anacostia station .

===Early history===
The Anacostia area of the District of Columbia is one of the most economically depressed regions of the city, and has been since the 1960s. As early as 1981, consultants and studies were predicting that the Anacostia station would spark a similar economic revival in Anacostia. But little real estate speculation in the area had occurred as of mid-1982. To help spur development, the D.C. City Council adopted a comprehensive land-use policy in 1985 (the city&#x27;s first), and identified the area around the planned Anacostia station at Howard Road SE as a proposed regional shopping center and designated it a &quot;development opportunity area&quot;. In 1988, the D.C. City Council designated the entire Anacostia area an Economic Development Zone, giving tax and other incentives to developers who constructed buildings or established businesses in the area. A wave of federal and city housing subsidies poured into the area in 1989 as the opening of the station neared, leading to the renovation of about 3,500 housing units (homes and apartments) and a rise in the price of land (to $55 per square foot from $2 per square foot, an increase of 2,650 percent) around the station. Many residents and businesses in the area resisted development which was out of character with the Anacostia Historic District, and feared the loss of the area&#x27;s identity. However, at least one study by a professor of urban and regional planning at George Washington University found that the historic district designation had done little to spur economic growth in the neighborhood. These fears were supported by Dorn McGrath, Jr., director of the George Washington University Institute for Urban Development Research, who says that new Metro stations attracted high-income residents who gentrified their areas, drove rents up, and caused neighborhoods to lose their identity.

===Opening===
As the Anacostia station opened, little development had occurred, however. The closest businesses (hair salons, carry-out fast food stores, auto repair and tire shops) were three blocks away, and no plans for retail development had been submitted despite the city&#x27;s action six years earlier. Nonetheless, McGrath and the nonprofit Anacostia Economic Development Corp. both believed new restaurants, new service businesses, and housing redevelopment were coming quickly.

These hopes initially seemed justified. As property assessments in D.C. fell an average of 0.3 percent, assessments near the Anacostia station rose 4.1 percent in 1992 and 9.7 percent in 1993. In mid-1993, the District of Columbia rezoned of vacant land (bounded by South Capitol Street, Anacostia Drive SE, and Howard Road SE) known as Poplar Point for mixed-use retail, office and residential use rather than industrial use in order to spur economic development. Dr. McGrath and others warned that the city was moving too fast and allowing economic development to get out of control.

===Late 1990s===
But by 1997, almost no economic development around the Anacostia station had occurred despite the Economic Development Zone incentives or existence of the new Metro station. In 1999, D.C. Mayor Anthony A. Williams again made development of Poplar Point a major focus of the District government. The Oliver Carr Co., a major D.C. area real estate developer, offered to build the D.C. Department of Employment Services a new headquarters next to the Anacostia Metro station if the government would sell the company its building at 6th Street NW and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, but the offer was not accepted. In 2001, the National Capital Planning Commission produced a master plan for the city&#x27;s memorials and monuments which suggested that Anacostia (including the Anacostia Metro station) become a hub for new memorials.

Another five years passed, and still Metro and the District of Columbia were trying to find builders who would develop land around the Anacostia station. Although the District of Columbia was building two office buildings at Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue and Good Hope Road (the Anacostia Professional Building at 2041 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Gateway building at 1800 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE), Metro was still unable to find developers willing to respond to its call for economic improvement next to the Anacostia station.

===Early 2000s===
In 2005, D.C. Mayor Williams proposed Metro move its headquarters to a site near the Anacostia station, setting off a years-long controversy. Williams promised to relocate of city offices and the headquarters of the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation to the building to ensure high occupancy rates. Williams said Metro could then sell its downtown eight-story office building and land at 5th and F Streets NW for $75 million, which would help the transit agency fund projects as well as the move. City officials and Anacostia residents said that the move would spur economic growth in the area, although private-sector developers said that was not clear. Although the D.C. City Council passed legislation requiring Metro to locate in Anacostia (if it moved), Metro officials were skeptical that the move would be cost-effective.

After a year without any movement on the proposal, the Anacostia Waterfront Corp. proposed a more detailed, even larger development that included of office space, apartments and condos, and retail space. The AWC also proposed building another of office and residential space by constructing a building above the Anacostia station&#x27;s bus bays. D.C. representatives on Metro&#x27;s board of directors pushed the agency to accept the proposal in April 2007. But by November 2007, no decision had been made. In September 2008, D.C. Deputy Mayor for Economic Development Neil Albert joined Metro&#x27;s board of directors in a move many observers interpreted as an attempt to persuade Metro to move to the Anacostia station. D.C. City Council members criticized Virginia&#x27;s representatives on the Metro board for not doing more to support the move, and threatened to withhold approval for the Silver Line to Ashburn Station and Dulles International Airport Station. The District backed down from the threat after an independent consultant&#x27;s report for Metro found that the move would cost the transit agency $70 million. Nonetheless, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty (who took office in 2007) said moving Metro&#x27;s headquarters to the Anacostia station remained the &quot;highest priority of our administration&quot;.

===Criticism===
Metro&#x27;s efforts to develop the land at the Anacostia station have been strongly criticized. When Metro began operations in 1976, the transit agency created the Joint Development Program cooperatively promote retail, office, and residential development on land owned by Metro, by state or local governments, or private owners in order to boost bus and rail ridership on the system, generate operating income for Metro, and help state and local governments see a return on their investment in Metro (through revenues or increases in tax assessments). By 2007, Metro had signed 56 joint development projects generating $129 million (over 30 years) in income. At least one study showed that Metro-sponsored developments significantly outperformed developments built solely by the private sector. Nonetheless, Metro was only generating a rather small $4.3 million a year from its joint development projects, and anecdotal evidence indicated that Metro had a very mixed history in actually bringing development online.

===Current status===
In 2006, Metro&#x27;s Interim General Manager, Dan Tangherlini, established a task force composed of experts in land use and economic development to study Metro&#x27;s efforts to develop land around its Metrorail stations. Delivered in September 2007, the report found that Metro managers focused on running the system day-to-day and opening new stations and lines rather than pushing income-generating development at existing stations; Metro staff were either apathetic to and &quot;sometimes obstructionist&quot; regarding development planning (particularly regarding stations in Anacostia and Prince George&#x27;s County); Metro had alienated developers and residents, subjected plans to &quot;interminable reviews&quot;, ignored community concerns, and rarely coordinated with local or state government. Although a quarter of Metro&#x27;s stations had property available for development (most of them in Anacostia and Prince George&#x27;s County), Metro had done little to develop them. &quot;Metro has been totally ineffective and counterproductive to any decent development at Metro stations,&quot; the task force chairman said. The report concluded that Metro had actually hindered development near Metrorail stations. Dozens of proposals had been stymied, and development proposals had dropped to an extremely low 2.1 per station per year. Although the report said the problem was urgent, Metro&#x27;s board of directors repeatedly postponed discussion of the report for at least seven months.

The last publicly reported development proposal at the Anacostia station came in September 2008. Urban-City Ventures LLC announced it had purchased of land along both sides of Howard Road SE just west Anacostia Metro station and planned to build a big-box store there (although the retailer was not announced). Meanwhile, Clark Realty Capital LLC and the District of Columbia were petitioning the federal government to transfer of federally owned land at Poplar Point to build office buildings.

<text>Congress Heights station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station situated in the Congress Heights neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. Opened on January 13, 2001, the station is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Serving only the Green Line, it is positioned at the intersection of Alabama Avenue and 13th Street, beneath St. Elizabeths Hospital. Congress Heights marks the terminus of the Green Line in the District of Columbia as it extends southeastward.

Groundbreaking for the final segment of the Green Line occurred on September 23, 1995, and Congress Heights station officially opened on January 13, 2001. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail southeast of the Anacostia station, as well as the opening of the Branch Avenue, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue, and Suitland stations.

Congress Heights is the closest metro station to the CareFirst Arena, home to the Washington Mystics of the WNBA and the Capital City Go-Go of the NBA G League.

==Station layout==
Congress Heights is the southernmost underground station on the Green Line and the whole transit network that features an island platform with escalator entrances on either side of Alabama Avenue. A park and ride and bus bays are located adjacent to the northern entrance. The station features the &quot;Arch II&quot; design found at Columbia Heights, Glenmont, Georgia Avenue-Petworth, and Mount Vernon Square.

<text>The Falaise pocket or battle of the Falaise pocket (; 12–21 August 1944) was the decisive engagement of the Battle of Normandy in the Second World War. Allied forces formed a pocket around Falaise, Calvados, in which German Army Group B, consisting of the 7th Army and the Fifth Panzer Army (formerly ), were encircled by the Western Allies. The battle resulted in the destruction of most of Army Group B west of the Seine, which opened the way to Paris and the Franco-German border.

Six weeks after the 6 June 1944 Allied invasion of Normandy, German forces were in turmoil, having expended irreplaceable resources defending the frontline and with Allied air superiority threatening the availability of food and ammunition. However, on the Allied side, British forces had expected to liberate Caen immediately after the invasion, an operation which ended up taking nearly two months, and US forces had expected to control Saint-Lô by the 7 June, yet German resistance delayed this until after Caen&#x27;s liberation.

The Allied armies developed a multi-stage operation, beginning with Operation Goodwood on 18 July, and continuing with Operation Cobra on 25 July, which saw American forces pushing into a gap around Saint-Lô and overwhelming the defending German forces. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army, which included large segments of the force that had broken through the German lines. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting little resistance. Concurrently, the British/Canadian troops pushed south in Operation Bluecoat, attempting to keep the German armour engaged. Four depleted panzer divisions were insufficient to defeat the First US Army, driving the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.

On 8 August, Allied ground forces commander General Bernard Montgomery ordered the Allied armies to converge on the Falaise–Chambois area to envelop Army Group B, with the First US Army forming the southern arm, the British the base, and the Canadians the northern arm of the encirclement. The Germans began to withdraw on 17 August, and on 19 August the Allies linked up in Chambois. German counter-attacks forced gaps in the Allied lines, the most significant of which was a corridor forced past the 1st Polish Armoured Division on Hill 262, a commanding position at the pocket mouth. By the evening of 21 August, the pocket had been sealed, with an estimated 50,000 Germans trapped inside. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops managed to escape the pocket before it was closed. The Allied Liberation of Paris came a few days later, and on 30 August the remnants of Army Group B retreated across the Seine, completing Operation Overlord.

==Background==

===Operation Overlord===
Early Allied objectives in the wake of the D-Day invasion of German-occupied France included the deep water port of Cherbourg and the area surrounding the town of Caen. Allied attacks to expand the bridgehead had rapidly defeated the initial German attempts to destroy the invasion force, but bad weather in the English Channel delayed the Allied build-up of supplies and reinforcements, while enabling the Germans to move troops and supplies with less interference from the Allied air forces. Cherbourg was not captured by the VII US Corps until 27 June, and the German defence of Caen lasted until 20 July, when the southern districts were taken by the British/Canadians in Operation Goodwood and Operation Atlantic.

General Bernard Montgomery, the Allied ground forces commander, had planned a strategy of attracting German forces to the east end of the bridgehead against the British/Canadians, while the US First Army advanced down the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula to Avranches. On 25 July the US First Army commander, Lieutenant-General Omar Bradley, began Operation Cobra. The US First Army broke through the German defences near Saint-Lô and by the end of the third day had advanced south of its start line at several points. Avranches was captured on 30 July and within 24 hours the US VIII Corps of the US Third Army crossed the bridge at Pontaubault into Brittany and continued south and west through open country, almost without opposition.

===Operation Lüttich===
The US advance was swift and by 8 August, Le Mans, the former headquarters of the German 7th Army, had been captured. After Operation Cobra, Operation Bluecoat and Operation Spring, the German army in Normandy was so reduced that &quot;only a few SS fanatics still entertained hopes of avoiding defeat&quot;. On the Eastern Front, Operation Bagration had begun against Army Group Centre which left no possibility of reinforcement of the Western Front. Adolf Hitler sent a directive to Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, the replacement commander of Army Group B after the sacking of Gerd von Rundstedt, ordering &quot;an immediate counter-attack between Mortain and Avranches&quot; to &quot;annihilate&quot; the enemy and make contact with the west coast of the Cotentin peninsula.

Eight of the nine Panzer divisions in Normandy were to be used in the attack, but only four could be made ready in time. The German commanders protested that their forces were incapable of an offensive, but the warnings were ignored and Operation Lüttich commenced on 7 August around Mortain. The first attacks were made by the 2nd Panzer Division, SS Division Leibstandarte and the SS Division Das Reich, but they had only 75 Panzer IVs, 70 Panthers and 32 self-propelled guns. The Allies were forewarned by Ultra signals intercepts, and although the offensive continued until 13 August, the threat of Operation Lüttich had been ended within 24 hours. Operation Lüttich had led to the most powerful remaining German units being defeated at the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula by the US First Army, and the Normandy front on the verge of collapse. Bradley said,

===Operation Totalize===

The First Canadian Army was ordered to capture high ground north of Falaise to trap Army Group B. The Canadians planned Operation Totalize, with attacks by strategic bombers and a novel night attack using Kangaroo armoured personnel carriers. Operation Totalize began on the night of 7/8 August; the leading infantry rode on the Kangaroos, guided by electronic aids and illuminants, against the , which held a front, supported by the 101st SS Heavy Panzer Battalion and remnants of the 89th Infantry Division. Verrières Ridge and Cintheaux were captured on 9 August, but the speed of the advance was slowed by German resistance and some poor Canadian unit leadership, which led to many casualties in the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division and 1st Polish Armoured Division. By 10 August, Anglo-Canadian forces had reached Hill 195, north of Falaise. The following day, Canadian commander Guy Simonds relieved the armoured divisions with infantry divisions, ending the offensive.

=== Allied plan ===
Still expecting Kluge to withdraw his forces from the tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a &quot;long envelopment&quot;, by which the British/Canadians would pivot left from Falaise toward the River Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and the Loire, trapping all surviving German forces in western France. In a telephone conversation on 8 August, the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at Argentan. Montgomery and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, Alençon and Falaise quickly, many Germans might escape. Believing he could always fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as the man on the spot, and the proposal was adopted.

==Battle==
It is also referred to as the battle of the Falaise gap (after the corridor which the Germans sought to maintain to allow their escape).

===Operation Tractable===


The Third Army advance from the south made good progress on 12 August; Alençon was captured and Kluge was forced to commit troops he had been gathering for a counter-attack. The next day, the US 5th Armored Division of the US XV Corps advanced and reached positions overlooking Argentan. On 13 August, Bradley over-ruled orders by Patton for a further push northwards towards Falaise by the 5th Armored Division. Bradley instead ordered the XV Corps to &quot;concentrate for operations in another direction&quot;. The US troops near Argentan were ordered to withdraw, which ended the pincer movement by the XV Corps. Patton objected but complied, which left an exit for the German forces in the Falaise pocket.

With the Americans on the southern flank halted and then engaged with Panzer Group Eberbach, and with the British pressing in from the north-west, the First Canadian Army, which included the Polish 1st Armoured Division, was ordered to close the trap. After a limited attack by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division down the Laize valley on 12–13 August, most of the time since Totalize had been spent preparing for Operation Tractable, a set-piece attack on Falaise. The operation commenced on 14 August at 11:42, covered by an artillery smokescreen that mimicked the night attack of Operation Totalize. The 4th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Polish Armoured Division crossed the Laison, but delays at the River Dives gave time for the Tiger tanks of the to counter-attack.

Navigating through the smoke slowed progress, and the mistaken use by the First Canadian Army of yellow smoke to identify their positions—the same colour strategic bombers used to mark targets—led to some bombing of the Canadians and slower progress than planned. On 15 August, the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Canadian (Armoured) Brigade continued the offensive, but progress remained slow. The 4th Armoured Division captured Soulangy against determined German resistance and several German counter-attacks, which prevented a breakthrough to Trun. The next day, the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division entered Falaise against minor opposition from &quot;Waffen SS&quot; units and scattered pockets of German infantry, and by 17 August had secured the town.

At midday on 16 August, Kluge had refused an order from Hitler for another counter-attack, and in the afternoon Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies. Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked Kluge and recalled him to Germany; Kluge then killed himself with potassium cyanide, fearing his involvement in the 20 July plot. Kluge was succeeded by Field Marshal Walter Model, whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the &quot;II SS Panzer Corps&quot;—with the remnants of four Panzer divisions—held the north face of the escape route against the British/Canadians, and the &quot;XLVII Panzer Corps&quot;—with what was left of two Panzer divisions—held the southern face against the Third US Army.

Throughout the retreat, German columns were constantly harried by Allied fighter bombers of the US Ninth Air Force and the RAF Second Tactical Air Force, using bombs, rockets and guns, turning the escape routes into killing grounds. Despite claims of large numbers of tanks and other vehicles destroyed from the air, a post-battle investigation showed that only eleven armoured vehicles could be proved to have had been destroyed by aircraft, although about one third of wrecked trucks were lost to air attack and many others had been destroyed or abandoned by their crews, probably due to the air threat.

===Encirclement===

On 17 August the encirclement was still incomplete. The 1st Polish Armoured Division, part of the First Canadian Army, was divided into three battlegroups and ordered to make a wide sweep to the south-east to meet American troops at Chambois. Trun fell to the 4th Canadian Armoured Division on 18 August. Having captured Champeaux on 19 August, the Polish battlegroups converged on Chambois, and with reinforcements from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division, the Poles secured the town and linked up with the US 90th and French 2nd Armoured divisions by evening. The Allies were not yet astride the 7th Army escape route in any great strength, and their positions were attacked by German troops inside the pocket. An armoured column of the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, took half the village and kept a road open for six hours until nightfall. Many Germans escaped, and small parties made their way through to the Dives during the night.

Having taken Chambois, two of the Polish battlegroups drove north-east and established themselves on part of Hill 262 (Mont Ormel ridge), spending the night of 19 August digging in. The following morning, Model ordered elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division and 9th SS Panzer Division to attack from outside the pocket towards the Polish positions. Around midday, several units of the 10th SS Panzer Division, 12th SS Panzer Division and 116th Panzer Division managed to break through the Polish lines and open a corridor, while the 9th SS Panzer Division prevented the Canadians from intervening. By mid-afternoon, about 10,000 German troops had passed out of the pocket.
The Poles held on to Hill 262 (The Mace), and were able from their vantage point to direct artillery fire onto the retreating Germans. Paul Hausser, the 7th Army commander, ordered that the Polish positions be &quot;eliminated&quot;. The remnants of the 352nd Infantry Division and several battle groups from the 2nd SS Panzer Division inflicted many casualties on the 8th and 9th battalions of the Polish Division, but the assault was eventually repulsed at the cost of nearly all of their ammunition, and the Poles watched as the remnants of the XLVII Panzer Corps escaped. During the night there was sporadic fighting, and the Poles called for frequent artillery bombardments to disrupt the German retreat from the sector.
German attacks resumed the next morning, but the Poles retained their foothold on the ridge. At about 11:00, a final attempt on the positions of the 9th Battalion was launched by nearby SS troops, which was defeated at close quarters. Soon after midday, the Canadian Grenadier Guards reached Mont Ormel, and by late afternoon the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine. For the Falaise pocket operation, the 1st Polish Armoured Division listed 1,441 casualties including 466 killed, while Polish casualties at Mont Ormel were 351 killed and wounded, with eleven tanks lost. German losses in their assaults on the ridge were estimated at 500 killed and 1,000 men taken prisoner, most from the 12th SS-Panzer Division. Scores of Tiger, Panther and Panzer IV tanks were destroyed, along with many artillery pieces.

By the evening of 21 August, tanks of the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had linked with Polish forces at Coudehard, and the 2nd and 3rd Canadian Infantry divisions had secured St. Lambert and the northern passage to Chambois; the Falaise pocket had been sealed. Approximately 20–50,000 German troops, minus heavy equipment, escaped through the gap and were reorganized and rearmed, in time to slow the Allied advance into Eastern France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
The battle of the Falaise pocket ended the Battle of Normandy with a decisive German defeat. Hitler&#x27;s involvement had been damaging from the first day, with his insistence on unrealistic counter-offensives, micro-management of generals, and refusal to withdraw when his armies were threatened with annihilation. More than forty German divisions were destroyed during the Battle of Normandy. No exact figures are available, but historians estimate the battle cost the Germans 450,000 men, including 240,000 who were killed or wounded. The Allies had among their ground forces, including and . The Allied air forces lost killed or missing in connection with Operation Overlord. The final battle of Operation Overlord, the Liberation of Paris, followed on 25 August, and Overlord ended by 30 August with the retreat of the last German unit across the Seine.

The pocket area was full of the remains of battle. Villages had been destroyed, and derelict equipment made some roads impassable. Corpses of soldiers and civilians littered the area, along with thousands of dead cattle and horses. In the hot August weather, maggots crawled over the bodies, and swarms of flies descended on the area. Pilots reported the smell from hundreds of feet (metres) in the air. General Eisenhower recorded that:


Fear of infection from the rancid conditions led the Allies to declare the area an &quot;unhealthy zone&quot;. Clearing the area was a low priority though, and went on until well into November. Many swollen bodies had to be shot to expunge gases within them before they could be burnt, and bulldozers were used to clear the area of dead animals.

Disappointed that a significant portion of the German army had escaped from the pocket, many Allied commanders, particularly among the Americans, were critical of what they perceived as Montgomery&#x27;s lack of urgency in closing the pocket. Writing shortly after the war, Ralph Ingersoll—a prominent peacetime journalist, who had served as a planner on Eisenhower&#x27;s staff—expressed the prevailing American view at the time:

Some historians have thought that the gap could have been closed earlier; Wilmot wrote that, despite having British divisions in reserve, Montgomery did not reinforce Guy Simonds, and that the Canadian drive on Trun and Chambois was not as &quot;vigorous and venturesome&quot; as the situation demanded. The British author and historian Max Hastings wrote that Montgomery, having witnessed what he called a poor Canadian performance during Totalize, should have brought up veteran British divisions to take the lead. D&#x27;Este and Blumenson wrote that Montgomery and Harry Crerar might have done more to impart momentum to the British/Canadians. Patton&#x27;s post-battle claim that the Americans could have prevented the German escape, had Bradley not ordered him to stop at Argentan, was &quot;absurd over-simplification&quot;.

Wilmot wrote that &quot;contrary to contemporary reports, the Americans did not capture Argentan until 20 August, the day after the link up at Chambois&quot;. The American unit that closed the gap between Argentan and Chambois, the 90th Division, was according to Hastings one of the least effective of any Allied army in Normandy. He speculated that the real reason Bradley halted Patton was not fear of accidental clashes with the British, but knowledge that, with powerful German formations still operational, the Americans lacked the means to defend an early blocking position and would have suffered an &quot;embarrassing and gratuitous setback&quot; at the hands of the retreating and the 2nd and 12th &quot;SS-Panzer&quot; divisions. Bradley wrote after the war that:

===Casualties===
By 22 August, all German soldiers west of the Allied lines were dead or in captivity. Historians differ in their estimates of German losses in the pocket. The majority state that from 80,000 to 100,000 troops were caught in the encirclement, of whom killed, taken prisoner, and . Shulman, Wilmot and Ellis estimated that the remnants of were in the pocket. D&#x27;Este gave a figure of trapped, of whom , and . Shulman gives , and . Wilmot recorded , and . Williams wrote that troops escaped. Tamelander estimated that troops were caught, of whom killed and prisoner, while perhaps another . In the northern sector, German losses included , self-propelled guns and other light armoured vehicles, as well soft-skinned vehicles and abandoned or destroyed. In the fighting around Hill 262, German losses totalled killed, prisoner and , and armoured vehicles destroyed. By 22 August 1944, the 12th SS-Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; had lost around 8,000 soldiers, out of its initial strength of 20,540, along with most of its tanks and vehicles, which had been redistributed among several Kampfgruppe in the previous weeks. Elements of several German formations had managed to escape to the east, but they left behind most of their equipment. After the battle, Allied investigators estimated that the Germans lost around and assault guns in the pocket, and that little equipment was taken across the Seine.

He was Speaker of the Senate of Canada from 2001 to 2006, when he became Leader of the Government (Liberal) in the Senate. Hays was the Leader of the Opposition in the 39th Canadian Parliament (2006-2007), and chair of numerous Senate committees.

He obtained his B.A. degree in history from the University of Alberta and his LL.B. degree from the University of Toronto. Following his articles, in 1966, with the Calgary-based firm Macleod Dixon, he was called to the Alberta Bar, and became known as a prominent lawyer.

As well, he had a meaningful role in the firm&#x27;s strategic planning and government relations. He served as Chairman of Macleod Dixon, LLP after his retirement from the Senate. He has been a member of Macleod Dixon, and successor firm Norton Rose Fulbright, for over 50 years.

He has chaired the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee and Management Committee, as well as serving as Chair of the Liberal party&#x27;s Revenue Committee. From 1996 to 1998, he served as Election Readiness Co-Chair and National Platform Co-Chair for the Liberal party. Hays is also the past Chair of the Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group and the Canadian section of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum.

Hays officially vacated his Senate seat on June 30, 2007.

Hays served as an Honorary Lieutenant-colonel of The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) since 2000 with two extensions in 2007 and 2010 as Honorary Colonel of the Regiment. In 2005, he was admitted to the pantheon of l&#x27;Order of La Pléiade by the Canadian branch of l’Assemblée Parlementaire de la Francophonie (APF).

<text>[[Baron]] Loránd Eötvös de Vásárosnamény (or simply Loránd Eötvös ; ; ; 27 July 1848 – 8 April 1919), also called Baron Roland von Eötvös in English literature, was a Hungarian physicist. He is remembered today largely for his work on gravitation and surface tension, and the invention of the torsion pendulum.

In addition to Eötvös Loránd University
and the Eötvös Loránd Institute of Geophysics in Hungary,
the Eötvös crater on the Moon,
the asteroid 12301 Eötvös and the mineral lorándite
also bear his name, as well as a peak (Cima Eotvos) in the Dolomites.

==Life==

Born in 1848, the year of the Hungarian revolution, Eötvös was the son of the Baron József Eötvös de Vásárosnamény (1813–1871), a well-known poet, writer, and liberal politician, who was cabinet minister at the time, and played an important part in 19th century Hungarian intellectual and political life. His mother was the Hungarian noble lady Agnes Rosty de Barkócz (1825–1913), member of the illustrious noble family that originally hailed from the Vas county, and through this, he descended from the ancient medieval Hungarian noble Perneszy family, which died out in the 18th century. Loránd&#x27;s uncle was Pál Rosty de Barkócz (1830–1874) was a Hungarian nobleman, photographer, and explorer, who visited Texas, New Mexico, Mexico, Cuba and Venezuela between 1857 and 1859.
Loránd Eötvös first studied law, but soon switched to physics and went abroad to study in Heidelberg and Königsberg. After earning his doctorate, he became a university professor in Budapest and played a leading part in Hungarian science for almost half a century. He gained international recognition first by his innovative work on capillarity, then by his refined experimental methods and extensive field studies in gravity.

Eötvös is remembered today for his experimental work on gravity, in particular his study of the equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass (the so-called weak equivalence principle) and his study of the gravitational gradient on the Earth&#x27;s surface. The weak equivalence principle plays a prominent role in relativity theory and the Eötvös experiment was cited by Albert Einstein in his 1916 paper &quot;The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity&quot;. Measurements of the gravitational gradient are important in applied geophysics, such as the location of petroleum deposits. The CGS unit for gravitational gradient is named the eotvos in his honor.

From 1886 until his death, Loránd Eötvös researched and taught in the University of Budapest, which in 1950 was renamed after him &quot;(Eötvös Loránd University)&quot;.

==Torsion balance==
A variation of the earlier invention, the torsion balance in the Eötvös experiment, the Eötvös pendulum, designed by Eötvös, is a sensitive instrument for measuring the density of underlying rock strata. The device measures not only the direction of force of gravity, but the change in the force of gravity&#x27;s extent in the horizontal plane. It determines the distribution of masses in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The Eötvös torsion balance, an important instrument of geodesy and geophysics throughout the whole world, studies the Earth&#x27;s physical properties. It is used for mine exploration, and also in the search for minerals, such as oil, coal and ores. The Eötvös pendulum was never patented, but after the demonstration of its accuracy and numerous visits to Hungary from abroad, several instruments were exported worldwide, and the richest oilfields in the United States were discovered by using it. The Eötvös pendulum was used to prove the equivalence of the inertial mass and the gravitational mass accurately, as a response to the offer of a prize. This equivalence was used later by Albert Einstein in setting out the theory of general relativity.

This is how Eötvös describes his balance:
One of Eötvös&#x27; assistants who later became a noted scientist was Radó von Kövesligethy.

==Honors==
To honor Eötvös, a postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932. Another stamp was issued on 27 July 1948 to commemorate the centenary of the birth of the physicist.
Hungary issued a postage stamp on 31 January 1991.

<text>Southern Avenue station is an island platformed Washington Metro station in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on January 13, 2001, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for only the Green Line, the station is located on the southern side of Southern Avenue, putting it just outside the District of Columbia, opposite Valley Terrace straddling the D.C/Maryland border. Southern Avenue is the first station in Maryland going southeast on the Green Line.

Groundbreaking for the final segment of the Green Line occurred on September 23, 1995, and the station opened on January 13, 2001. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail southeast of the station and the opening of the , , , and stations.

This station provides service to National Harbor via Metrobus route NH1 and TheBus route 35.

==Station layout==
The Southern Avenue station consists of a single island platform in an open cut, located below and in the middle of its associated parking and bus transfer complex. Although this station is open-cut, and the next station east (railroad south) (Naylor Road) is elevated, there is an underground section of the Green Line&#x27;s tracks between these two stations; additionally, the Southern Avenue station descends into a tunnel at its western (railroad northern) end. The construction and overall design of the station is similar to that of on the Silver Line, on the Blue Line, Morgan Boulevard on both lines, and at most underground island-platform stations because of its depressed but open-air layout.

<doc id="664359" wikidata="Q7375852" url="?curid=664359" title="Rubberneck (album)">
<text>Rubberneck is the debut studio album by American rock band Toadies. It was released in August 1994 on Interscope Records and attained RIAA gold and platinum status in December 1995 and December 1996 respectively. The album produced the band&#x27;s most popular single, &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot;.

In 2014, in honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Kirtland Records re-released the album on CD and vinyl on April 1. The album was remastered and also includes five bonus tracks. Three of the bonus tracks are previously unreleased songs from the original album&#x27;s sessions, including &quot;Run in with Dad&quot; and a cover of Pylon&#x27;s &quot;Stop It&quot;, both of which were previously recorded for &quot;Velvet&quot;, and &quot;Rockfish&quot;, an early version of &quot;Waterfall&quot;, a song later recorded for &quot;Feeler&quot;, the intended follow-up to &quot;Rubberneck&quot;. The other two bonus tracks are early live versions of &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Tyler&quot;, recorded at Trees Dallas on December 5, 1991. The vinyl only features the original 11 album tracks, and includes a download of the five bonus tracks.

Also in honor of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, current band member Clark Vogeler made &quot;Dark Secrets: The Stories of Rubberneck&quot;, a 23-minute documentary about the album, featuring original behind-the-scenes footage recorded by Lisa Umbarger as well as newly recorded interviews. It was debuted on March 10, 2014, at the Kessler Theater, in Dallas, Texas. The documentary was then posted on the internet two days later.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that &quot;Todd Lewis&#x27;s voice comes across somewhere between Robert Plant and Eddie Vedder.&quot; &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted that the band&#x27;s &quot;shrewd mixture of black-metal thematics, punk aggression, and grunge melancholia contains a seed of genuine revelation that rewards anyone who isn&#x27;t scared off by the whiff of brimstone and scandal that clings to their work.&quot;

<text>Radio broadcasting began in New Zealand in 1922, and is now dominated by almost thirty radio networks and station groups. The Government has dominated broadcasting since 1925, but through privatisation and deregulation (in 1989) has allowed commercial talk and music stations to reach large audiences. New Zealand also has several radio stations serving Māori tribes, Pasifika communities, ethnic minorities, evangelical Christians and special interests.

State-owned broadcaster Radio New Zealand reaches the broadest range of listeners with bilingual flagship broadcaster Radio New Zealand National. Several previously state-owned radio brands like top-rating talk station Newstalk ZB are now owned by NZME Radio, which operates eight networks on terrestrial radio and iHeartRadio. Ten radio networks are operated by MediaWorks New Zealand, including top-rating music stations The Edge and The Rock. Independent stations like The SkiFM Network, 1XX and Coast FM continue to serve local communities, alongside low-powered and internet stations.

New Zealand was also one of the first countries to introduce Christian radio, with Rhema Media now operating three networks around the country. The Student Radio Network began with the start of bFM in 1969 and the first of the country&#x27;s community access broadcasters was founded in 1981. Te Māngai Pāho funds Māori iwi radio stations, and the Pacific Media Network continues to receive Government support.

==History==

===Early radio===

Professor Robert Jack made the first broadcast in New Zealand from the University of Otago physics department on 17 November 1921. The first radio station, Radio Dunedin, began broadcasting on 4 October 1922, but it was only in 1925 that the Radio Broadcasting Company (RBC) began broadcasts throughout New Zealand.

Auckland Radio Service started broadcasting at 7:45pm on 13 April 1923 and 1YA was soon being heard on 4 evenings a week as far away as Dunedin. The government facilitated the creation of RBC and gave it a 5-year contract. Auckland Radio was then taken over by the Radio Broadcasting Company of New Zealand on 20 November 1925. A new studio, with a more powerful transmitter and mast, opened on 9 August 1926 in Newton and could be heard in Rarotonga. It cost about £8,500 and used a 500W International Western Electric Company transmitter, able to reach most of the country. RBC&#x27;s similar 3YA in Christchurch started broadcasting on 1 September 1926. Its 2YA Wellington studio was officially opened on 16 July 1927. Listenership rose rapidly, from 3,588 licences in 1926 to 18,162 in 1927.
In addition to those stations, in 1923 there were also Auckland stations 1AA (C.N. Edwards), 1AB (V.J. Penny), 1AC (L.S. Spackman), 1AH (Hartle &amp; Gray), 1AM (Hamilton Amateur Radio Club), 2YA (then owned by Wilkins &amp; Field, Nelson), 2AB (D. Wilkinson, Motueka), Gisborne had 2AD (P.R. Stevens), 2AE (R.J. Patty), 2AF (W.J. Sinclair), 2AG (I.H. O&#x27;Meara), a 2AG station (L.K. Ewen) was also in Whanganui, as was 2AH (Whanganui Amateur Wireless Club), 2AI in Wellington (W.L. Harrison), 2AJ in Stratford (Bransgrove), 2AK (L. Rawson, Hāwera), 2AP (P. Collier, Brooklyn) 2YK (Dominion Radio, Wellington), 2XA (Experimental Station, Wellington), Christchurch stations 3AA (R.J. Orbell), 3AB (F. Vincent), 3AC (Radio Society), 3AF (L.F. Ball), Greymouth 3AD (R.G.F. Blake), 4AA (F.D. Bell, Palmerston), 4AC (R.E. Robinson, Dunedin), 4AD (A.E. Jordan, Invercargill), 4YA was then owned by British Electric Supply and, with 4YO (Radio Supply Company), also in Dunedin, and 1YA (then Auckland Radio Service) had the only three 500 watt transmitters in the country. Further stations in 1926 were 1YC (N.C. Shepherd, Whangārei), 1YD (L.R. Keith, Auckland) and 2YL (B. C. Spackman, Napier).

In 1930, station 1ZR began operating from the Queen Street premises of Lewis Eady Limited in Auckland. Pioneer broadcasters included Aunt Daisy, Dudley Wrathall and Rod Talbot. A &quot;radio church&quot;, the &#x27;Friendly Road&#x27;, was run by &#x27;Uncle Tom&#x27; Garland and the Reverend Colin Scrimgeour.

In 1932, RBC&#x27;s assets were acquired by the government, which established the New Zealand Broadcasting Board (NZBB). This would later be replaced by the New Zealand National Broadcasting Service (NBS) and the National Commercial Broadcasting Service (NCBS). In the 1950s, these merged to become the New Zealand Broadcasting Service (NZBS), a government department. In 1962, this gave way to the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC), an independent public body modelled on the BBC in the UK.

Until the 1980s, stations used a series of New Zealand call signs, consisting of a single digit and two letters (see right). In addition to YA National programme stations, YC Concert programme stations and a limited number of privately owned X stations, several stations were operated commercially by the government. In each region, the largest city was assigned a ZB station (1ZB Auckland, 2ZB Wellington, 3ZB Christchurch and 4ZB Dunedin) and a ZM music station (1ZM Auckland, 2ZM Wellington and 3ZM Christchurch). The Newstalk ZB and ZM brands continue to be used by NZME (formerly The Radio Network). The second largest city was assigned a ZA station: 1ZA in Taupō, 2ZA in Palmerston North, 3ZA in Greymouth and 4ZA in Invercargill. In other towns and cities the final letter was assigned from the town or city name such as 4ZG in Gore and 1ZH in Hamilton. These ZA and other stations, also now owned by NZME, were rebranded as Classic Hits and rebranded again in 2014 as The Hits. 1YA, 2YK, 3AQ, 4YA were the first stations operating in the country&#x27;s four main cities, and 5ZB was a mobile radio station broadcast in railway carriages during the 1940s.

As part of the Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975, the country switched from 10 kHz to 9 kHz channel spacing on the AM band on 23 November 1978.

The Government deregulated the broadcasting market in 1989, and the number of private stations grew exponentially as a result. Most were locally owned and operated, but eventually became part of the Mediaworks group of stations, and by 2004 the majority of former privately owned stations had been rebranded (see below) and owned by the one company.

===FM broadcasting===
New Zealand&#x27;s original FM broadcasting allocation, until 1986 was 89.0 to 94.0 MHz, and then from 1986, until 2000 was 89.0 to 100.0 MHz. Meanwhile, the segments of the band not used for FM broadcasting, such as the band above 100 MHz had been had been allocated to land-based AM mobile radio-telephone users (taxis, fire and others), an allocation that dates back to the late 1950s. New Zealand&#x27;s FM frequency allocation issue was not fixed until the late 1990s, after those users had been progressively reassigned channels elsewhere, when the band was expanded to the full 20 MHz. New Zealand now uses the standard global allocation of 87.5–108 MHz for FM. Today, full-power FM stations use frequencies between 88.6 MHz and 106.5 MHz, although the band between 101.8 MHz and 103.3 MHz is allocated to future government, Maori and limited short term broadcasting, it is currently unused (as of February 2024). Low-power FM stations use frequencies from 87.6 MHz to 88.3 MHz and from 106.7 MHz to 107.7 MHz. New Zealand permits Radio Data System subcarriers, Radio NZ National uses RDS for its FM network with AF (Alternative Frequency) enabled, commercial radio use of RDS for station identification and program information is widespread.

The first station to broadcast on FM in New Zealand was a temporary station in Whakatāne called FM 90.7. The station ran from 5 January 1982 until 31 January 1982. The first permanent station in New Zealand to broadcast on FM was Magic 91FM in Auckland broadcasting on 91.0FM followed by 89 Stereo FM broadcasting on 89.4FM. Both stations are no longer in operation; Magic 91 is the local Auckland frequency for ZM and 89 Stereo FM today broadcasts a simulcasted FM version of Newstalk ZB. Radio New Zealand started broadcasting on FM in the early 1980s and most networks now broadcast on FM. On 22 February 1982, Victoria University of Wellington&#x27;s student station Radio Active became the first station in Wellington to legally broadcast on FM.

===Pirate radio===

From 1966, Radio Hauraki broadcast from the MV &quot;Tiri&quot; that was moored in international waters near Auckland, and in 1968 from the MV &quot;Tiri II&quot;. This was the only ship-based pirate station to ever broadcast in the Southern Hemisphere which it did for 1,111 days, although it was subsequently discovered that the ship had always been moored in the New Zealand territorial waters off the Hauraki Gulf.

In 1970 it was granted a licence to broadcast from land and a successor company still broadcasts to the Auckland market under the Radio Hauraki brand and is networked nationwide. In 1972, Radio Bosom broadcast briefly until Post Office inspectors found and seized the transmitter which was concealed in a maintenance tunnel under a University of Auckland building. Now known as 95bFM, the station broadcasts legally from the University of Auckland student union building.

Kiwi Radio began broadcasting as 4YZW on 1977, and as WKNZ on the medium wave band in 1978. On 25 March 1980 they launched a pirate Radio Freedom broadcast on both shortwave and FM. In 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Kiwi Radio&quot;, due to not wanting to be confused with the many other stations named Radio Freedom. Kiwi Radio was known to relay other pirates, such as some from Australia, before it ceased broadcasting in 1997. In 2013, Radio Totse began broadcasting on shortwave to North America on 6.925 MHz.

==Public radio==

===Radio New Zealand===

Radio New Zealand is a New Zealand&#x27;s state-owned national public service radio broadcasting service. It was formed in 1925, and took on its modern form under the Radio New Zealand Act 1995. The broadcaster is bound by the Charter and Operating Principles included in the Act, which is reviewed by the New Zealand Parliament every five years and was last amended in 2004. The broadcaster is required to provoke debate and critical thought, reflect New Zealand and Māori cultural diversity, cater for varied ages and interests, promote music and drama and create a sense of national identity. It is also a Civil Defence broadcaster.

Radio New Zealand National, formerly National Radio, is Radio New Zealand&#x27;s general public service broadcaster. It broadcasts flagship news programmes like Morning Report, Midday Report and Checkpoint, alongside morning show Nine to Noon, afternoon show The Panel and a range of interviews and magazine programmes. Radio New Zealand Concert is FM radio network broadcasting classical, jazz, and rock music and regular news updates. The playlist is among the most diverse and eclectic of the world&#x27;s state run classical music networks. Other services offered by Radio New Zealand include the Radio New Zealand International Pacific shortwave service, the AM Network Parliamentary broadcaster and The Wireless youth website.

===Iwi Radio Network===

Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori is a Māori radio network of bilingual English and Māori language radio stations serving local Māori iwi through local frequencies and online streaming. The individual stations are all funded by and accountable to Te Māngai Pāho. They broadcast national and local news coverage, music, educational programming, comedy, drama and programmes that teach the Māori language, with local personalities, community shows and shared network programmes.

===Pacific Media Network===

The Pacific Media Network is a pan-Pasifika national broadcasting group owned and operated by the National Pacific Radio Trust and funded by New Zealand on Air. It has a legislative role of serving Pacific peoples and communities in English and ten Pacific languages, in a way that shapes the country&#x27;s national identity. It also aims to &quot;empower, encourage and nurture Pacific cultural identity and economic prosperity in New Zealand, to celebrate the Pacific spirit&quot;. Its primary source of income is a $3.25 million annual grant from the Government. Pacific Media includes the nationwide Niu FM radio network set up in 2002, the Auckland-based Radio 531pi station launched in 1993, and the independent Pacific Radio News service.

===Access Radio Network===

The Association of Community Access Broadcasters represents the twelve community radio stations set-up between 1981 and 2010 which have received government funding since 1989. They broadcast community programming and provide facilities, training and on-air time for individuals and community groups to produce programming. The stations are also required to represent particular religions, cultures, languages, ages and sexualities. There are currently local access stations in Auckland, Waikato, Taranaki, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Manawatu, Wairarapa, Kapiti, Wellington, Nelson, Canterbury, Otago and Southland.

===Student Radio Network===

The Student Radio Network (known as bNet between 1998 and 2009) is a loose grouping of the current and former student radio stations. These radio stations broadcast local independent news and current affairs, and have provided a platform for new or independent New Zealand artists. The network has co-operated on advertising sales, collaborated on ideas and shared original programming. Some stations are run by student associations while others are owned by independent non-profit trusts. The 2011 Canterbury earthquake and the introduction of voluntary student membership have raised fresh concerns about the future of student broadcasting, but the role of the stations continues to be recognised by New Zealand on Air and the Ministry for Culture and Heritage.

The network began as a grouping of university student radio stations in major centres, and for a while operated as a commercial network of student union stations and former student union stations in six markets. In 1986 member station Radio One launched the Rad-One Card, a low-cost discount and loyalty card with on-air competitions, to raise funds. Similar schemes have now been launched by other stations, such as the Active card by Radio Active and the bCard by bFM and Bank of New Zealand. It adopted the name bNet for over a decade, using the brand of Auckland member station bFM, and held the bNet NZ Music Awards between 1998 and 2007 to promote the role the stations played in fostering New Zealand music across genres. However, the group agreed to change its name back to Student Radio Network at a meeting in 2009, to reflect the broader range of student radio brands. The stations continue to provide a spotlight for local bands, having previously helped promote Fat Freddys Drop, Kora, Jordan Reyne, Dimmer, Jet Jaguar, Shocking Pinks, The Enright House and some underground and electronica acts.

In 1986 the Weird Culture, Weird Custom compilation was released with twelve tracks on the album, two chosen by competition by each of the six member stations. Artists included Jean-Paul Sartre Experience, Putty in Her Hands, and Cassandra&#x27;s Ears. It was distributed by Jayrem Records. &quot;Freak The Sheep Vol. 2&quot; was another similar compilation album released by Flying Nun Records in 1992.

==Private radio==

===Central Media Group NZ (Ski FM Network)===

The Ski FM Network is New Zealand&#x27;s largest independent CHR Pop/Top 40 radio network, wholly privately owned and operated. 
From studios in Taupo and operations/offices in Auckland.
Iain Stables (ex ZM/Edge) and Danielle Jones(ex Beach FM and MWorks/MoreFm) own the majority of this company and have some media holdings too in Western Australia.

Whanganui on 93.6 FM, Ohakune 106.2 FM, Ruapehu south/Turoa 91.8, National Park/Whakapapa 105.4, Rotorua 90.0 FM, Taihape Mangaweka 90.0 FM, Taumarunui 91.1, Taupo and Turangi 1224 AM /87.8 FM, and online via Tune-In, iHeart Radio and www.skifmnetwork.co.nz.

The Ski Brand has a regional coverage model across multiple frequencies which includes a population footprint of 135,772 plus the Summer and Winter visitor population spikes, it allows their advertisers to buy at regional rates and receive metropolitan origin visitor/F.I.T audiences. Currently, with no need for individual breakouts agencies/ advertisers find the return on investment for full network placement works exceptionally well and great value for campaign spend due to Ski&#x27;s reach.

===New Zealand Media and Entertainment===
New Zealand Media and Entertainment is one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest radio companies. It was formed in 2014 through the formal merger of The Radio Network and the New Zealand assets of APN News &amp; Media, which includes magazines and newspapers like &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot;. The Radio Network, in turn, began when the commercial radio activities of Radio New Zealand were sold-off in 1996, putting the Sports Roundup service and the Newstalk ZB, Classic Hits and ZM networks into entirely private ownership.

The company now runs talk radio network Newstalk ZB and sports radio network Radio Sport alongside music networks Radio Hauraki, Coast, Flava, The Hits and Mix. Privately owned Gore station Hokonui Gold is operated by NZME under a long-term lease contract.

===MediaWorks New Zealand===
MediaWorks New Zealand operates ten radio brands alongside its television brands, TV3 and FOUR. It was formed in 2004 when CanWest Global Communications combined television company TV3 Network Services and radio company RadioWorks, to sell-down its shares in the company on the NZSX and sell its remaining stake to Ironbridge Capital. MediaWorks has continued to face ongoing financial difficulties, requiring a $43 million loan from the Government in 2011 before briefly going into receivership in 2013. Since Mark Weldon took charge of the company in August 2014, it has outlined plans for greater integration between radio and television. This includes the planned introduction of a combined news service, NewsHub, in 2016.

Since its inception in 2004, MediaWorks has relaunched local heritage stations to its adult contemporary More FM and easy listening The Breeze brands, reducing or removing local programming. Its other music brands include The Edge, The Rock and The Sound. It has rolled out new talk radio network Radio Live and local music station Kiwi FM, converted Radio Pacific to LiveSport, and purchased brands Mai FM and George FM. MediaWorks affiliates include Times FM in Orewa, Coromandel FM on the Coromandel Peninsula, Radio Dunedin in Otago and Port FM in Timaru.

===Rhema Media===
Rhema Media is the country&#x27;s largest Christian media organisation, and a major New Zealand radio company. Christchurch evangelist Richard Berry first proposed Radio Rhema in the 1960s, and it began permanently broadcasting in 1976. Rhema Media is the founding organisation of United Christian Broadcasters and provides the model of broadcasting for member organisations in other countries. For example, Australia&#x27;s Rhema FM is modelled on New Zealand&#x27;s Rhema.

The organisation is predominantly funded by donations, and operates young-oriented Life FM, family-oriented Rhema and Star for older listeners. The future of some of its networks was brought into question in 2010, when the Government required Rhema Media to raise 6.4 million dollars to renew its commercial radio frequencies for the following two decades.

===Brian FM===
Broadcasting to Marlborough, Nelson, Whanganui, Taihape, Timaru, Oamaru, Ashburton, Alexandra and Cromwell. The station does not use DJs, instead plays music with short ad-libbed commercials.

===The Wolf===

The Wolf was a short-lived radio network based at Lake Tekapo in South Canterbury. The station was independently owned from its outset in 2001, and broadcast to rural areas where in some cases the larger network stations did not broadcast or operate local stations. The network started at a time when many New Zealand stations had been taken over by New Zealand&#x27;s two largest radio companies The Radio Network and MediaWorks New Zealand or replaced with a network product based from one of the main centres, particularly Auckland. Due to funding issues, it went off the air permanently in 2003.

The network broadcasts on 100.6 FM in several centres, including Temuka, Blenheim, Kaikōura, Methven, Waimate, Oamaru, Alexandra, Gore, Mount Cook Village, Reefton, Geraldine, Twizel, Fairlie, Murchison, Timaru, Westport, Hanmer Springs and Karamea. It also broadcast on 91.9 FM in Hokitika, 97.8 FM in Lake Tekapo, 99.0 FM in Kāpiti Coast, 105.4 FM in Auckland and 1593 AM in Christchurch. The Wolf was available nationwide on the Sky Television digital service.

===Low power and amateur===
Low power broadcasting licences in New Zealand are issued by Radio Spectrum Management and managed by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. In many cases, they provide community groups with easy access to broadcasting. Any resident is allowed a free licence at a maximum of 1 watt EIRP in the FM guardbands from 87.6 to 88.3 and from 106.7 to 107.7 MHz under a General User Radio licence (GURL). Some frequency restrictions apply to areas under the flight paths into Auckland Airport and Wellington Airport to minimise interference with the airports&#x27; instrument landing systems (which operate on 109.9 MHz and 110.3 MHz). Prior to June 2010, the lower band was located between 88.1 and 88.8 and a maximum of 500 mW EIRP allowed. Broadcasters on these frequencies are required to cease operations if they interfere with other, licensed broadcasters and have no protection from interference from other licensed or unlicensed broadcasters. Contact details must also be broadcast every hour.

One licensee may operate two transmitters anywhere (close together), but a third transmitter must be at least 25 km away from at least one of the first two transmitters. Radio Inspectors regularly monitor and make random unannounced visits to broadcasters, and will impose fines for violations of the regulations. New broadcasters are also subject to an initial compulsory inspection. The high cost of frequencies in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch makes low-power broadcasting particularly popular in these markets.

==Radio markets==

Radio stations in New Zealand include some network stations and a number of predominantly low-power stations that operate in a single market. Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch are the largest commercial radio markets, surveyed four times a year by GfK New Zealand. Between 1991 and 2015, the survey was conducted by TNS New Zealand. Smaller markets like Waikato receive four surveys a year as well, but the data is an average of the past four quarters, as opposed to isolated quarterly results in the major markets.

Radio New Zealand networks do not participate in commercial market surveys, meaning they are not included in listener numbers and are not counted in market share. However, a Nielsen Media Research survey commissioned by Radio New Zealand suggests its National and Concert stations reach a combined audience of 563,000 unique listeners. The National programme reaches 503,000, or 14 percent of the 15+ population, giving it 10.2 percent station share. The Concert programme reaches 138,000 or 4 percent of the 15+ population, with an estimated market share of 1.4 percent. Commercial radio surveys, by comparison, are based on listeners 10+.

===Auckland===

Auckland is the country&#x27;s largest radio market. Surveys are conducted four times a year to garner the listener habits of more than 1.2 million people who live in Auckland&#x27;s urban centres. Due in part to high levels of peak hour commuter traffic congestion, 74.6 percent listen to the radio on a weekly basis. Newstalk ZB has maintained a long-running first place in the ratings under successive breakfast hosts Paul Holmes and Mike Hosking, with a 13.4 percent station share and a weekly cumulative audience of 178,000 listeners in the latest Q2-14 survey for August to September 2014.

The Edge has 7.7 percent share and 169,200 listeners; ZM has 4.5 percent share and 136,900 listeners; The Breeze has 7.8 percent share and 136,200 listeners; Mai FM has 5.2 percent share and 126,200 listeners; and Coast has 7.8 percent share and 105,400 listeners. Radio Live, The Hits, The Sound, The Rock, George FM, More FM, Flava and Radio Hauraki all maintain audiences over 50,000. Radio Sport, the BBC World Service and Hindi station Radio Tarana also have audiences above 30,000.

===Wellington===

The Wellington market covers an area of around 335,000 people, where 64.1 percent of people listen to commercial radio during the week. Despite the absence of former local breakfast duo Polly and Grant, ZM continues to lead the ratings with around 42,000 listeners each week and 6.7 percent market share.

Newstalk ZB has local news and a local morning programme, has the highest market share at 14.5 percent, and has around 34,000 listeners. Long-running and predominantly local station The Breeze has 12.7 percent station share and over 38,000 listeners. The Hits and The Edge also have more than 30,000 listeners and more than 7 percent market share.

===Christchurch===

Around 1,500 people are surveyed for the Christchurch market, in which 72.8 percent of the population of 365,000 people are radio listeners. Under breakfast hosts Simon Barnett and Gary McCormick, More FM consistently leads the ratings with around 70,000 listeners. Newstalk ZB maintains the highest market share at 15.3 percent, with nearly 56,000 listeners. Its local news and morning programme provide a particular focus on the issues that have followed the 2010 Canterbury earthquake.

The Breeze has 57,000 listeners and 9.9 percent station share; The Sound has 44,000 listeners and 9.1 percent station share; and The Edge, The Rock and ZM also have more than 30,000 listeners and more than 3 percent station share.

===Other survey markets===

The largest of New Zealand&#x27;s provincial markets is Waikato, in which there are 227,000 people and 79.7 percent of people listen to the radio each week. Locally founded The Edge has the most listeners at 47,000, followed by ZM with 44,000 listeners. Partly local The Hits has 12.2 percent market share and 33,000 listeners, just ahead of locally founded The Rock with 12.1 percent market share and 32,000 listeners.

Three other markets also cover the upper North Island. Northland covers 112,000 people, with More FM reaching 27,000 listeners and 17.3 percent market share. Tauranga covers 136 thousand people, with Coast reaching 23,000 listeners and 15 percent market share. Only 47,000 people live in the Rotorua market, where Flava leads with 8,000 listeners and Coast has 16.6 percent market share.

In the central North Island, Taranaki includes a population of 84,000 people, with The Edge attracting 21,000 listeners and The Hits securing 13.8 percent market share. The Hawke&#x27;s Bay market includes 107,000 people, with 23,000 listeners tuning into The Edge and Newstalk ZB maintaining 15.6 percent market share. Manawatu has a radio market of 97,000, with 18 thousand listening The Edge and 15 percent of market share going to The Rock.

On the South Island, the Nelson market includes 61,000 people, with 15,000 people listening to The Edge and 15 percent of market share going to Coast. Dunedin includes 102,000 people, with 19,000 listening to The Edge, 16,000 listening to The Hits and Radio Dunedin maintaining a 14.8 percent market share. Southland covers 68,000 people, including 14,000 listening to The Edge. Market share is heavily contested with Coast securing around 16.5 percent and The Rock securing 15 percent.

===Non-survey markets===

There are several radio markets that are not recognised by commercial surveys, but in which there is still competition between commercial radio stations such as Newstalk ZB. These include Tokoroa and Taupō in the Waikato and the Kāpiti Coast in Wellington. Others include Blenheim in Marlborough, Greymouth on the West Coast, Ashburton and Timaru in Canterbury, and Oamaru, Alexandra, and Queenstown in Otago.

<text>In Zulu mythology, Uhlanga is the marsh from which humanity was born, and is the Zulu word for &quot;reed&quot; that was also a synonym for &quot;societal custom&quot;.

==Myths==

Myths about Uhlanga are linked to myths about Unkulunkulu and Umvelinqangi, and there are different, conflicting mythical traditions about all three.

According to Jacob Olupona, Umvelingangi wedded himself to Uhlanga, likely because of Uhlanga&#x27;s multiple-colored reeds. Umvelingangi used the reeds to create men and women called Unkulunkulu, who each founded a tribe.

== Plot ==

Rahul Khanna and Anjali Sharma are best friends in their college. Unknown to him, Anjali is secretly in love with him. When Tina Malhotra, the attractive daughter of the college principal, enrolls in the college, Rahul is immediately smitten. Anjali is heartbroken and returns to her hometown to be with her family, leaving Rahul for a long time. Rahul and Tina become a couple and eventually get married.

Eight years later, when Anjali Khanna grows up, she reads in Tina&#x27;s letter that Rahul knew another Anjali from college, who Tina believes is Rahul&#x27;s soulmate and she had realized that Anjali loved Rahul. Anjali Khanna sets about reuniting the two to fulfil her mother&#x27;s final wish, as stated in her letter.

Anjali Sharma, now a traditional feminine woman, is engaged to Aman Mehra, but leaves for a month before her wedding, to conduct a dance workshop in Shimla. Anjali Khanna enrolls in the same camp, being supported by her grandmother, and Rahul ends up meeting Anjali Sharma when he shows up to see his daughter.

Rahul realizes he is falling in love with Anjali this time but does not reveal it after he finds out she is engaged. Anjali returns home for her wedding with Aman Mehra, midway through the dance camp.

During the ceremony, Anjali cannot bring herself to continue with the rituals. Aman realizes what is happening and calls off the wedding. Having heard from Anjali Khanna that Rahul was his fiancé&#x27;s first love, he advises Anjali to marry Rahul instead.

==Production==

===Story===
After the experience of assisting and acting in Aditya Chopra&#x27;s directorial debut, the musical romantic drama &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot; (1995), Karan Johar was encouraged to try his own hand at directing. With &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, he chose to pair up the same lead actors, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol, for his own romance film. During the filming of &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, Khan had also encouraged Johar to make his own film, and said that he would be willing to star in it. They were signed by producer and his father Yash Johar in early 1997. Yash Johar officially announced the film in October 1997 at Mehboob Studios in Bandra.

Johar first wrote a story, which was a love triangle between a tomboy, a very pretty girl, and a slightly insensitive boy, but he shelved the idea because he was not very satisfied with it. Then he wrote another plot about a widower and his child, which he shelved as well. Eventually, he decided to merge the two stories into one. He explained in an interview with Rediff.com: &quot;It was about the trauma of a widower and his little child. How the child really wants a mother and how she brings her mother into her father&#x27;s life. Then I thought: Why not bring a youth aspect to the story? Why not a flashback? That&#x27;s how the story got made.&quot; The story also includes a &quot;personal desires vs. parental loyalties&quot; theme and has some &quot;East meets West&quot; themes, but instead of the characters going abroad, it creates a virtual West inside India.

As he states in his 2017 autobiographical book &quot;An Unsuitable Boy&quot;, Johar wanted Khan to have a role he never did before, thus decided to go for that of a father, getting inspiration from the 1995 British romantic comedy &quot;Jack and Sarah&quot;, about a man who loses his wife whe she delivers a baby that he initially doesn&#x27;t want but then builds a bond with the child, before falling in love with another woman.

===Development===

Karan Johar was certain from the beginning that he wanted to cast Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol in the lead roles, having observed them during the making of &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;. It took longer to fill the role of Tina. The role was written with Twinkle Khanna in mind, but she turned it down. Other actresses such as Urmila Matondkar, Tabu, Shilpa Shetty, Aishwarya Rai, Raveena Tandon and Karisma Kapoor were offered the role but also turned it down. Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan noticed Rani Mukherji&#x27;s acting in &quot;Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat&quot; (1996), and suggested her to Karan Johar. He thus signed her, giving a boost to her career. Saif Ali Khan and Chandrachur Singh were initially offered the role of Aman, but they both turned it down, thus prompting Johar to rope in Salman Khan.

Johar, who is also a costume designer, wanted to set a new level for style in Hindi cinema with this film. He and his friend Manish Malhotra, the film&#x27;s costume designer, made trips to London for costumes, much to the chagrin of his father and producer Yash Johar, who was concerned about the budget. Many of the costumes in the film prominently displayed logos from designers such as DKNY and Polo. In addition to the designer fashions, Johar also created a somewhat fantastical world where the students speak Hinglish and enjoy a pristine college campus, where there is no crime or hate, and traditional Hindu values are pervasive. Johar admitted that the look and feel of the college scenes in the film were patterned after &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;, saying, &quot;The art, the costumes, tilt toward the West, but the soul of the film is Indian.&quot; He hired Sharmishta Roy as art director, and told her to produce something similar to Riverdale High School of the Archie Comics, with some &quot;90210&quot; influence as well. Johar said of the outcome, &quot;If you see &quot;KKHH&quot;, Shahrukh plays Archie, Rani Mukherji plays Veronica, and Kajol played Betty. It was exactly that. And the principal looked like Weatherbee, and Ms. Grundy was Archana Puran Singh.&quot; Johar also hired Farah Khan to do the choreography, Jatin–Lalit to provide the music, Santosh Thundiyil as cinematographer, and Nikhil Advani as his associate director. Shabina Khan assisted Manish Malhotra with costume design.

===Filming===
Filming began on 21 August 1997. The crew was young and inexperienced to the point where Shah Rukh Khan had to explain basic technicalities of filming. Khan later said, &quot;Karan makes no bones of the fact that his technical knowledge of filmmaking was not at its peak when he made the biggest hit of the decade.&quot; The entire film was shot in nine and half months with a substantial part of it shot in Mauritius. The title song was filmed over a ten-day period. in several picturesque locations in Scotland, including Eilean Donan, Glen Coe, Loch Lomond and Tantallon Castle with the nearby Bass Rock as a backdrop in one scene. The scenes from the summer camp in Shimla were filmed at Wenlock Downs in Ooty, Tamil Nadu.

During the bicycle sequence in the song &quot;Yeh Ladka Hai Deewana&quot;, Kajol lost control of her bike, fell flat on her face, and was knocked unconscious while also injuring her knee. During the promotional &quot;Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn&#x27;t remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them and was so happy with the result that it was put into the film.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack for &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; was composed by Jatin–Lalit and the lyrics were penned by Sameer. This is the first collaboration of the duo with Karan Johar. It was released by the Sony Music label on 19 August 1998. While the film was still untitled, Javed Akhtar was signed to write the lyrics, and even wrote and recorded one song (Koi Mil Gaya). However, when the movie was titled &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, he found the title mediocre, obscene, and vulgar and decided to quit the project. Akhtar later regretted leaving the film, as he found it decent and could see that the title has become quite a buzzword, realizing that he was the only one who disliked the title.

The album became the best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year, with units sold in India. The title song remained on the Indian music charts for over a year, and the album peaked at number #2 on the Malaysian albums chart (RIM) in 1999. Sony Music Indonesia also sold 300,000 copies in Indonesia, for a combined copies sold in India and Indonesia.

In 2012, it was voted as the most popular film song of the previous decade by &quot;NDTV&quot;. The full soundtrack came in second place in a similar poll conducted by the BBC, the first place being taken by &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, an album which was also composed by Jatin–Lalit.

On 2002, Sony Music India also released Kuch Kuch Hota Hai in Sinhala version.
==Reception==

===Critical reception===
While comparing the film to &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; gave &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; 3.5 out of 5 stars. She especially liked the performance of Kajol, and thought that the film would appeal to young and romantic viewers primarily for its &quot;MTV ambience&quot; and &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Day flavours&quot;. On the negative side, she said &quot;The second half, however, gets drowned in a sea of emotions. Too many people begin to cry a bit too much.&quot; In contrast to these views, the reaction of Sujata C J, writing for Rediff.com, was that the film was very disappointing, with many cliches and a bad storyline, though Santosh Thundiyil and Sharmishta Roy were praised for their camerawork and art direction, respectively. Nandita Chowdhury in a review for &quot;India Today&quot;, said that Karan Johar was almost able to rekindle the Khan-Kajol magic of &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, and that overall the film was &quot;a good distraction&quot;.

In January 2023, &quot;IndieWire&quot; ranked &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; as the world&#x27;s best romantic comedy (rom-com) on Netflix, above &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010) at number two and &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999) at number three. &quot;IndieWire&quot; writers Kate Erbland and Alison Foreman called &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; &quot;a love triangle for the ages&quot; and said it is &quot;a bittersweet and bubbly story of young love, missed opportunity, and female friendship&quot; with &quot;what’s quite possibly the most romantic gazebo scene of all time.&quot;

<text>Branch Avenue station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Suitland, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on January 13, 2001, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station presently serves as the southeastern terminus for the Green Line, with the Branch Avenue rail yard lying just beyond this station. The station is located near the intersection of Auth Road and Old Soper Road.

This is also the station closest to Andrews Air Force Base.

==History==
Plans for a station as the southeastern terminus of the Green Line initially appeared in the original 1968 route map. However, by 1978 the Prince George&#x27;s County Council, after initially supporting the Branch Avenue alignment, changed their support to moving the terminus to a location adjacent to the Rosecroft Raceway. Metro followed suit and pursued the Rosecroft alignment instead of Branch Avenue in 1980. By May a group of citizens filed suit against Metro stating that the route was improperly changed and failed to conform to the plan adopted by county voters in 1968. In February 1981, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in stating the routing to Rosecroft could not be undertaken until it went through public review. After further appeal, in March 1982 the judge ruled that none of the proposed Green Line along the Rosecroft alignment could start construction until it went through the entire planning process again. After deciding to not file an appeal, in December 1984 Metro voted to change the southeastern terminus back to Branch Avenue thus allowing for construction to commence on the Green Line towards Prince George&#x27;s County.

Groundbreaking for the final segment of the Green Line occurred on September 23, 1995. The station opened on January 13, 2001. Its opening coincided with the completion of approximately of rail southeast of the Anacostia station and the opening of the Congress Heights, Naylor Road, Southern Avenue and Suitland stations. This represented the completion of the system as originally planned.

==Station layout==
Branch Avenue station has an island platform in an open cut between Auth Way and Capital Gateway Drive. Parking lots are located both east and west of the station platform. Constructed adjacent to the station is a rail yard with the capacity to store 116 cars.

<text>Jacob Austin (born March 2, 1932) is a former Canadian politician and former member of the Senate of Canada. He was appointed to the upper house by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on August 8, 1975 and represented British Columbia. At the time of his retirement he was the longest-serving senator.

==Life and career==
Austin was born in Calgary, Alberta. Prior to entering the Senate, Austin had careers as a lawyer and as a senior civil servant. He graduated from the University of British Columbia (BA, LLB) and Harvard Law School (LLM). In the 1950s, Austin was a legal partner of Nathan Nemetz, who later served as chief justice of the British Columbia Court of Appeal. Nemetz recruited Austin to join the Liberal Party.

In the early 1960s, Austin&#x27;s political career began when he served as executive assistant to Arthur Laing while he was Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources. While he was in Ottawa, Paul Martin Sr. asked him to serve on the legal team that negotiated the Columbia River Treaty on behalf of the government.

Austin&#x27;s only attempt to win an election was as the Liberal candidate in Vancouver Kingsway in the 1965 federal election, at which time it was an open seat. He came second to Grace MacInnis, who held the constituency on behalf of the New Democratic Party.

In 1970, he was appointed deputy minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and was part of the first Canadian trade mission sent to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He also played a key role in the establishment of Petro-Canada and Expo 86 in Vancouver.

In 1974, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau appointed Austin to be his chief of staff. In 1975, on Trudeau&#x27;s recommendation, Governor General Jules Léger appointed him to the Senate. During Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s final mandate as prime minister, Austin served as a Minister of State in the cabinet from 1981 to 1982 and then Minister of State for Social Development until Trudeau&#x27;s retirement in 1984. He returned to the Cabinet of Canada in 2003 when Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed him Leader of the Government in the Senate, in which capacity he served until the Liberal defeat in the 2006 election. He took mandatory retirement from the Senate on March 2, 2007, his seventy-fifth birthday.

He received the Order of the Aztec Eagle from the Government of Mexico in 2000. He was also inducted into the Order of British Columbia in 2010.

He has three daughters: Barbara, Edith and Sharon.

<doc id="664443" wikidata="Q752491" url="?curid=664443" title="Studebaker Golden Hawk">
<text>The Studebaker Golden Hawk is a two-door pillarless hardtop personal luxury car produced by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana, between 1956 and 1958.

==Styling==
The last automobile until the Avanti to have styling influenced by industrial designer Raymond Loewy&#x27;s studio, the Golden Hawk took the basic shape of the 1953–55 Champion/Commander Starliner hardtop coupe but added a large, almost vertical eggcrate grille and raised hoodline in place of the earlier car&#x27;s swooping, pointed nose, and was introduced as the Studebaker Speedster. At the rear, a raised, squared-off trunklid replaced the earlier sloped lid, and vertical fiberglass tailfins were added to the rear quarters. The Golden Hawk was two inches shorter than the standard Hawk at 153.6 inches.

==Power==

The raised hood and grille were added to allow space for a larger engine, Packard&#x27;s 352 in³ (5.8 L) V8, which delivered . This comparatively large, powerful engine in such a light car gave the Golden Hawk an excellent power-to-weight ratio (and thus performance) for the time; of 1956 American production cars, the Golden Hawk was second only to Chrysler&#x27;s 300B by that measure — and the Chrysler, which cost considerably more, was essentially a road-legal NASCAR racing car. The Golden Hawk, like the Chryslers, is a precursor to the muscle cars of the 1960s.

The heavy engine gave the car a reputation for being nose-heavy; the supercharged Studebaker engine that replaced the Packard engine in 1957 was heavier. Road tests of the time, many of which were conducted by racing drivers, seldom mentioned any handling issues in spite of the heavy front end. &quot;Speed Age&quot; magazine of July 1956 tested the Golden Hawk against the Chrysler 300B, Ford Thunderbird, and Chevrolet Corvette, finding that the Golden Hawk could out-perform the others comfortably in both 0-60 mph acceleration and quarter mile times. The fastest 0-60 reported in magazine testing was 7.8 seconds, while top speeds were quoted as plus.
The 1956 model powered by a Packard engine entered the famous Mille Miglia race in Italy.

==Options==
A wide variety of colors (including two-tone paint schemes) were available. Two-tone schemes initially involved the front upper body, the roof, and a panel on the tail being painted the contrast color, with the rest of the body in the base color. Later 1956 production had the body above the body trim line, including the trunk, in the contrast color with the tail panel, roof, and the body below the body trim line being in the base color. The interior included an engine turned dash.

An increased options list and reduced standard equipment were used to keep base price down compared to the previous year&#x27;s Studebaker Speedster, which the Golden Hawk replaced. Even turn signals were an option.

The Golden Hawk was matched with three other Hawk models for 1956, and was the only Hawk not technically considered a sub-model within one of Studebaker&#x27;s regular passenger car lines; the Flight Hawk coupe was a Champion, the Power Hawk coupe was a Commander, and the Sky Hawk hardtop was a President.
==1957–1958: The Golden Hawk==

The Golden Hawk was continued for the 1957 and 1958 model years, but with some changes. Packard&#x27;s Utica, Michigan, engine plant was leased to Curtiss-Wright during 1956 (and eventually sold to them), marking the end of genuine Packard production. Packard-badged cars were produced for two more years, but they were essentially rebadged Studebakers, including Packard Hawk – the restyled Golden Hawk. The Packard V8, introduced only two years earlier, was therefore no longer available. It was replaced with the Studebaker 289 in³ (4.7 L) V8 with the addition of a McCulloch supercharger, giving the same output as the Packard engine. This improved the car&#x27;s top speed, making these the best-performing Hawks until the Gran Turismo Hawk became available with the Avanti&#x27;s R2 supercharged engine for the 1963 model year.

The Golden Hawks were long. A padded dash was standard.

Styling also changed somewhat. A fiberglass overlay on the hood was added, which covered a hole in the hood that was needed to clear the supercharger, which was mounted high on the front of the engine. The tailfins, now made of metal, were concave and swept out from the sides of the car. The fins were outlined in chrome trim and normally were painted a contrasting color, although some solid-color Golden Hawks were built.

Halfway through the 1957 model year, a luxury &quot;400&quot; model was introduced, featuring a leather interior, a fully upholstered trunk, and special trim. Only 41 of these special cars were produced, and very few of the 41 exist today. One of them, the first production model, is housed at the Studebaker Museum in South Bend.

For 1958, the Golden Hawk switched to 14-inch wheels instead of 15-inch wheels, making the car ride a little lower. The 15-inch wheels, however, were available as an option. Other styling changes included a new, round Hawk medallion mounted in the lower center of the grille, and the available contrasting-color paint was now applied to both the roof and tailfins. One unique feature was a vacuum gauge on the instrument panel. Padded dash boards were standard.

Several minor engineering changes were made for &#x27;58, including revisions to the suspension and driveshaft that finally allowed designers to create a three-passenger rear seat. Earlier models had seating for only two passengers in the rear because the high driveshaft &quot;hump&quot; necessitated dividing the seat; a fixed arm rest (later made removable because of customer requests) was placed between the rear passengers in earlier models.

In January 2011, Barrett-Jackson auctions sold a 1957 Studebaker Hawk for a final hammer price of $99,000.

==Discontinuation==
Like many more expensive cars, Golden Hawk sales were heavily hit by the late-1950s recession, and the model was discontinued after only selling 878 examples in 1958. The Silver Hawk remained the only Hawk model; it was renamed simply the Studebaker Hawk for the 1960 model year.

<text>Robert Alexander Pérez Jiménez (born June 4, 1969) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball outfielder who played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Seattle Mariners, Montreal Expos, New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB) in parts of six seasons spanning 1994–2001. Listed at 6&#x27; 3&quot;, 205 lb., he batted and threw right handed.

==Career==
Born in Ciudad Bolívar, Pérez started his professional baseball career in the Venezuelan League as a 19-year-old rookie during the 1988–1989 season. He was signed by the Blue Jays organization as an amateur free agent in 1989.

In a six-season career, Pérez posted a batting average of .254 (126-for-497) with eight home runs and 74 runs batted in in 221 games, including 49 runs, 19 doubles, one triple and three stolen bases.

In 2007 and 2008 Pérez played in the Mexican League, batting over .300 both years. He also spent time in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) while playing for the Orix BlueWave (1999) and the Lotte Giants (2003–2004, 2007), respectively, and played with the Novara United of the Italian Baseball League during the 2011 season. In 2003, he tried to make a comeback to the majors by signing a minor league deal with the Seattle Mariners, was released at the end of spring training.

Besides, Pérez spent his entire 27-season career in the Venezuelan League with the Cardenales de Lara club between the 1989–90 and 2014-15 tournaments to become a living legend in his country, where he is nicknamed &quot;El Hombre Historia&quot; (The History Man). Such a nickname comes from the fact he set several all-time records in Venezuelan baseball history, including for the most home runs (125), RBIs (738), doubles (222) extra-base hits (382) and game appearances (1,300).

<doc id="664460" wikidata="Q3484260" url="?curid=664460" title="British Columbia Highway 7A">
<text>Highway 7A, known locally and on street signs as the Barnet Highway, Barnet Road, St. Johns Street, Inlet Drive and Hastings Street, was Highway 7&#x27;s original 1941 route between the harbour in Vancouver and Port Moody. The highway gained the &quot;7A&quot; designation around 1953 due to Highway 7 being re-designated along Lougheed Highway through Maillardville and Central Burnaby and was disestablished on April 1, 1999.

==Route details==
The long Highway 7A largely followed a parallel route alongside the Canadian Pacific Railway. The highway started off in the west at Seymour Street in Downtown Vancouver, and went along Hastings Street, passing its junction with Highway 1 en route, until it reached Boundary Road, where the highway crossed into Burnaby. Highway 7A continued east along Hastings Street in Burnaby for before turning northeast via Inlet Drive onto Barnet Highway. Once Hastings Street terminates the road narrows from 6 lanes to four, and the speed limit is upped from 50 to 80 km/h (from 31 to 50 mph). Barnet Highway carried Highway 7A on a winding long route on the south shore of Burrard Inlet through Burnaby and into Port Moody, where it meets an intersection with St. John&#x27;s Street. Highway 7A then travelled east along St. Johns Street to its junctions with Dewdney Trunk Road and Ioco Road, after which it bears the street name Barnet Highway again, before terminating at its junction with Highway 7 in Coquitlam.

==History==
Historically speaking, the route that Highway 7A took consisted of three distinct roads: the Dewdney Trunk Road, the Barnet Highway and Hastings Street. All of these roads have existed for well over a century. Dewdney Trunk road was once the principal route for traffic north of the Fraser and Hastings Street had been established early on in the history of Vancouver and Burnaby as municipalities. Both Barnet and Dewdney were completed around the turn of the 20th century 

In 1941, a province-wide highway numbering scheme came into effect, with Hastings, Barnet, St. Johns and Dewdney Trunk becoming part of Highway 7.
In 1952, Dewdney Trunk lost its highway designation as a new segment of Highway 7 from Shaughnessy Street to today&#x27;s intersection of St. Johns and Dewdney Trunk Road was completed. This included the building of a new overhead crossing the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks.

At some point in the early 1950s (possibly 1953) Highway 7 was rerouted to the newer Lougheed Highway through Maillardville and Central Burnaby. This finally gave Hastings, Barnet Highway and St. Johns Street the Highway 7A designation. During the mid-50s multiple improvements were made along the Barnet Highway section. In 1959, a study conducted by the Technical Committee for Metropolitan Highway Planning suggested the building of a series freeways throughout Vancouver. The committee looked at the possibility of a freeway over Burnaby Mountain which would be a bypass the Barnet over Burnaby Mountain, but ultimately rejected it.
 Different proposals called for a freeway bypass of Port Moody, a freeway through the Coquitlam Chines and others. None of these plans ever came to fruition.

Barnet Highway remained a two lane highway until the 1990s, when the province began to recognize that congestion was starting to build throughout the overall length of highway 7A. Using the concept of HOV lanes as a means to lessen single occupancy vehicle use and reduce said congestion, the province began to design the Barnet/Hastings People-Mover Project. The project started in 1991 and saw various layouts be considered. However, it was ultimately decided that Hastings would be widened to six lanes and the Barnet highway be finally upgraded into a four-lane facility. The right hand lanes in each direction along the two segments would operate as HOV lanes from 6:00 AM to 8:30 AM towards Vancouver and from 3:30 PM to 6:00 PM towards Port Moody. The improvement also saw the addition of an HOV lane going westbound on St. Johns Street and Clarke St. in Port Moody. The project was completed on September 4, 1996, at a cost of $105 million (equivalent to $161,811,024 in 2020). Counterintuitively, the project led to an increase in travel times on certain stretches of the route.

As part of the creation of TransLink, a major road network was to be created and maintained. The province had also decided to handover hundreds of kilometres of roadways to municipalities throughout the province. Highway 7A&#x27;s component routes were a part of the handover, and so on the April 1, 1999, Highway 7A ceased to be.
The Burnaby section of this road has been renamed to Barnet Road.

<doc id="664462" wikidata="Q1123578" url="?curid=664462" title="Upholstery">
<text>Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers. The word also refers to the materials used to upholster something.

&quot;Upholstery&quot; comes from the Middle English word &quot;upholder&quot;, which referred to an artisan who makes fabric furnishings. The term is equally applicable to , automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design. A person who works with upholstery is called an &quot;upholsterer&quot;. An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an &quot;outsider&quot; or &quot;trimmer&quot;. Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up. In contrast, today&#x27;s upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on.

==History==

The term “upholder” is an archaic word that was historically used to refer to an “upholsterer”. However, it seems to carry a specific connotation of repairing furniture rather than creating new upholstered pieces from scratch, similar to the distinction between a cobbler and a cordwainer.

In 18th-century London, upholders often took on the role of interior decorators, managing all aspects of a room&#x27;s decor. These individuals were members of the Worshipful Company of Upholders, a guild whose traditional role, before the 18th century, was to provide upholstery, textiles, and fittings for funerals. In the prominent London furniture-making partnerships of the 18th century, it was common for a cabinet-maker to pair with an upholder. Notable examples include partnerships like Vile and Cobb, Ince and Mayhew, and Chippendale and Rannie or Haig.

In the United States, cities like Grand Rapids, Michigan, and Hickory, North Carolina, are well-known centers for furniture manufacture. Similarly, in England, Long Eaton, Nottinghamshire, is recognized for its furniture industry, and many of the best upholsterers can still be found there. Nottinghamshire is also home to Webs Training Ltd, a company that specializes in training apprentices in the furniture manufacturing industry. These skilled artisans continue to create or recreate a wide range of antique and modern furniture pieces.

Furniture reupholstery remains a thriving industry in the UK, with numerous small and large businesses offering these services. This ongoing tradition ensures that both antique and contemporary furniture pieces can be restored and maintained for future generations.

During the reign of James VI &amp; I (1603–1625), the Baroque style emerged, and stitched edging appeared, meaning bespoke shapes could be created by stitched cushion pads on wooden frames, allowing for the first time design and artistic flair to become a hallmark of upholstered furniture of the age. Farthingale chairs (without arms, see below) were introduced, due to the popularity at the time of the large hooped skirt from which the chairs take their name. The use of velvet in upholstered furniture becomes popular.

During the reign of Charles I (Caroline Era), the Baroque style took hold in mainland Europe, and this style remained popular into the 18th century. It was characterised by the use of abundant ornamentation in furniture, and was initially promoted by the Catholic church as a response to the Protestant reformation, which perhaps explains why this style very quickly became popular in France, Spain and Italy yet Northern European nations and the British Isles took a lot longer to warm to Baroque-style furniture. England eventually adopted a lot of baroque-style furniture during this period, as a maritime nation with expanding trading links to Asia, heavy tropical woods were imported which allowed furniture of this style to be created, as well as Asian decorative techniques becoming fashionable.

Also during this period, although their origins were thought to be in the early 16th century, that ladder chairs became very popular. This type of chair has a tall back constructed of horizontal slats or spindles between the two uprights, a very practical chair design.

==Types==
===Traditional===
Traditional upholstery traces its roots back to ancient civilizations, where the need for comfort and functionality led to the creation of padded seating surfaces. From ancient Egypt to ancient Rome, early upholstery was primarily concerned with cushioning and supporting chairs, seats, and sofas. However, it was during the Renaissance period in Europe that upholstery flourished as an art form in its own right. Skilled artisans painstakingly handcrafted upholstery using techniques passed down through generations. One of the defining characteristics of traditional upholstery is its reliance on manual craftsmanship. Upholsterers, or &quot;upholsterists&quot;, as they are sometimes called, possess unique skills that enable them to transform raw materials into exquisite furniture pieces.

Traditional upholstery is a craft that evolved over centuries for padding and covering chairs, seats, and sofas before the development of sewing machines, synthetic fabrics, and plastic foam. Using a solid wood or webbed platform, it can involve the use of springs, lashings, stuffings of animal hair, grasses, coir, wools, hessians, scrims, bridle ties, stuffing ties, blind stitching, top stitching, flocks and wadding all built up by hand.
In the Middle Ages, domestic interiors were becoming more comfortable, and upholstery was essential in interior decoration. The decorations consisted mainly of what we would now consider as &quot;soft furnishings&quot;. However, there were simple platforms of webbing, canvas, or leather for stools, chairs, and elaborately decorated coverings that already demonstrated the rudimentary beginnings of upholstered furniture. By the start of the 17th century, chair seats were being padded, but this upholstery was still fairly basic. All sorts of stuffings from sawdust, grass, and feathers to deer, goat, or horsehair were used, although, in England, the Livery Company forbade goat and deer hair and imposed fines for misdemeanors. The stuffing was heaped on a wooden platform and held in place with a decorative top fabric and nails. This produced a simple dome shape sloping towards the seat. Only towards the end of the 17th century did upholsterers start developing techniques to distribute and shape the stuffing into more controlled shapes. Curled horsehair was used more consistently for stuffing, making it easier to hold in place with twine stitches developed from saddlery techniques. Thus, layers of stuffing could be distributed evenly and secured to stay in place. On a basic level, squab cushions were made more stable using tufting ties. Stuffed edge rolls appeared on seat fronts, providing support for cushions to be retained and later for deeper stuffing to be held in place under a fixed top cover.

What we now consider &quot;classic&quot; upholstery shapes and techniques flourished in the 18th century. Frames of elegant line and proportion were sympathetically matched by expertly executed upholstery. By now, the upholsterers&#x27; technical knowledge meant that stuffing could be controlled along upright and sloping lines, giving new comfort levels and a stated elegance. Later in the century, the border was replaced by a single piece of linen or scrim, which took over the stuffed seat and tacked to the frame. At the same time, the locked blind stitch and top-stitching combination (pulling the side and top surfaces together and bringing the stuffing up to make a firm top edge) evolved.

In the Victorian era, fashions of luxury and comfort gave rise to excesses of stuffing and padding. Mass production techniques made upholstered furniture available in large quantities to all sections of society. The availability of better-quality steel springs and the development of lashing techniques enabled upholstery to be built up on seats, backs, and arms independently of the frame shape. Stuffings became even more complex, edges became elaborately shaped into rolls and scrolls, and fabrics were folded into soft padded shapes using buttoning.

===Modern===
Modern furniture is more likely to be partly or wholly made with cellular Polyurethane foam. This foam provides structure, resilience (recovery from loading), and, most importantly, lightweight. It is then covered with an outer decorative textile. The synthetic polymer will age and lose performance within a &quot;reasonable&quot; time and be significantly lighter than the traditional fillings. (In this context, foam is graded by its weight per cubic metre. 50 kg per cubic metre or 5% mass is typical). It is also relevant to include a reference to the way furniture has evolved with regard to recreational use, e.g., television watching. Lower cost allows more regular change to take account of such issues as design, moving accommodation, and deterioration due to the way it is used. Bed Mattresses may be considered the same way, with appropriate allowance for different usage, although the amount of time in use is probably higher. This has significant implications for the end of life of the materials used in manufacture and the end value of the materials.It is also worth noting that the above includes a high availability of air within the article, leading to ignition risk concerns and the introduction of the UK Furniture Fire Regulations (FFR).

While modern advancements have introduced new materials and techniques to the world of upholstery, the artistry and attention to detail that define traditional upholstery remain unparalleled. Although sewing machines and synthetic foams have expedited the manufacturing process, they have not replaced the skill and expertise of the upholsterer. Traditional upholstery continues to thrive as a niche craft, appreciated by discerning individuals who seek timeless beauty and unparalleled comfort in their furniture.

===Automobile===
An automotive upholsterer, also known as a trimmer, coach trimmer, or motor trimmer, shares many of the skills required in upholstery and can work with carpets.

The term coach trimmer derives from the days when car frames were produced by manufacturers and delivered to coach builders to add a car body and interior trimmings. Trimmers would produce soft furnishings, carpets, soft tops, and roof linings often to order to customer specifications. Later, trim shops were frequently an in-house part of the production line as the production process was broken down into smaller parts manageable by semi-skilled labor.

Many automotive trimmers now work in automotive design or with aftermarket trim shops carrying out repairs, restorations, or customer conversions directly. A few high-quality motor car manufacturers still employ trimmers, for example, Aston Martin.

===Commercial===
This is the type of upholstery work offered to businesses. Examples would be restaurant seating consisting of booth seats, dining room chairs, bar stools, etc. Also, churches, including but not limited to pews and chairs for the congregation, hospitals, and clinics consisting of medical tables, chiropractic tables, dental chairs, etc. Also common to this type of upholstery would be lobby and waiting-area seating. Upholstered walls are found in some retail premises.

===Marine===

Upholsterers may be called upon to repair or replace seating, cushions, cabin furnishings, headliners, and boat carpeting. Marine upholstery, in particular, requires special considerations due to the harsh marine environment. Factors such as dampness, sunlight, and hard usage must be taken into account. Many sources now offer marine-grade vinyl, such as Spradling and Morbern, in hundreds of colors and styles.

Each style of marine-grade vinyl is rated according to cold crack, rub counts, and mold resistance. These ratings ensure the material can withstand the challenging conditions at sea. Stainless steel hardware, such as staples and screws, must be used to prevent rust and early breakdown of hardware and fasteners. The newest products for fastening vinyl in marine applications include Tenara thread and Monel staples. Tenara thread is known for its durability and resistance to UV radiation, while Monel staples are highly resistant to corrosion.

Any wood used in marine upholstery must be of marine quality to resist rot and decay. Typically, high-resiliency, high-density plastic foam with a thin plastic film is used to keep out water that might get by the seams. Closed-cell foam is often used for smaller cushions, which can sometimes double as flotation devices.

The evolution of boat seating reflects a journey of creative adaptation and technological advancement. Initially, boaters made do with simple wooden benches or flat surfaces. The advent of more resilient materials like plastic and vinyl in the 20th century revolutionized seat design, offering greater durability and water resistance. This change enabled more diverse and ergonomic designs. In the 21st century, technological progress has ushered in high-end features such as padded cushions, UV-resistant fabrics, and adjustable settings, enhancing comfort. Some contemporary seats even boast luxury features like in-built heating or massaging systems, signifying the transformation of boat seating from a fundamental element to a sophisticated, comfortable experience.

<text>Mentos are a brand of packaged scotch mints or mint-flavored candies owned by the Italian-Dutch company Perfetti Van Melle. First produced in 1932, they are currently sold in more than 130 countries worldwide. The mints are small oblate spheroids, with a slightly hard exterior and a soft, chewy interior. Is sold in many stores and vending machines.

They are typically sold in rolls which contain 14 mint discs, although the &quot;Sour Mix&quot; variety contains only 11 discs per roll. Smaller versions also exist, which typically contain 4 to 6 discs per roll. Certain flavors are sold in boxes in Australia, the United States, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil and the United Kingdom. The current slogan of Mentos is &quot;Stay Fresh&quot;, while the line previously used extensively in the 1980s and 1990s was &quot;The Freshmaker&quot;. Some Mentos packages describe the mints as &quot;chewy dragées&quot;. The typical Mentos roll is approximately in diameter and weighs . &quot;Mentos&quot; is the singular form.

==Ingredients==
Mint-flavored Mentos contain sugar, wheat glucose syrup, hydrogenated coconut oil, rice starch, natural flavors, gum arabic, sucrose esters of fatty acids, gellan gum, carnauba wax, and beeswax. Fruit-flavored Mentos contain sugar, wheat glucose syrup, hydrogenated coconut oil, citric acid, fruit juices from concentrate (strawberry, orange, lemon) (1%), rice starch, gum arabic, natural flavors, sucrose esters of fatty acids, gellan gum, carnauba wax, colors (beta-carotene, beetroot red), and beeswax. The formulation can vary based on country of manufacture.

==Flavors==

Mentos are available in several flavors including mint, mixed fruit, cola, bubble gum, and in an assortment of orange, strawberry, and lemon. Mentos first appeared as a liquorice-flavored sweet which can still be purchased in the Netherlands as &quot;Drop Mentos&quot;. New flavors were initially test-marketed in the Netherlands and throughout Europe; however, most of the flavors have been available worldwide recently. 

Other flavors include green apple, cinnamon, strawberry, mixed fruit (which contains a mix of cherry, strawberry, orange, and lemon flavors), grape, wintergreen, grapefruit, peach, plum, spearmint, strawberry yogurt, lemon yogurt, pineapple (pine fresh), red apple, currant and two versions of black licorice-flavored Mentos. Two varieties of the mint flavor, known as &quot;Mentos Strong&quot; and &quot;Air action Mentos&quot; are sold in the Netherlands. Also available in the Netherlands is the Special Mix 4 pack, containing the flavors mint, fruit, berry mix, strawberry, banana, cherry, and mango orange. Two varieties of the mint flavor are also sold in China, known as &quot;Mint&quot; and &quot;Strong Mint&quot;. Grape and &#x27;N Cream (presumably Apples and Cream), Strawberry &#x27;N Cream, and Banana &#x27;N Cream are also marketed in Asia. Chocolate Mentos were produced in 1989, but the flavor was discontinued. The chocolate variant is still available in some Asian countries. In 2006, the citrus mango flavor was introduced to the Japanese market. In the Philippines, a &quot;Dalandan Fresh&quot; variant is available. Other varieties of Mentos include: Mentos Sours, which recently became available in the United States, featuring Watermelon, Green Apple, and Lemon flavors; caffeinated &quot;Energy&quot; Mentos, sold mainly in Germany, where one roll equals the amount of caffeine in two cups of coffee; &quot;Fresh Cola&quot;-flavored Mentos released in New Zealand, Australia and parts of Europe and Asia; and &quot;AIR Mentos&quot; containing menthol, which are sold primarily in Belgium and the Netherlands. In India, the major flavors available are mint, lemon, strawberry, orange, watermelon and cola.

Mentos also make chewing gum, available in various flavors. It is available in Germany, Australia, Greece, China, Canada, Brazil, Turkey, the Netherlands, Poland, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and recently, the United States in blisters and bottles, both in three different flavors. In the Netherlands, Mentos Gum is sold in blisters and bottles in six different varieties: Pure (four flavors), Fruit (four flavors), Regular (five flavors), Bubblegum, Cubes (four flavors) and White (three flavors). 

In August 2005, the variety of the mint which comes in &quot;mixed berries&quot; and &quot;cool mint&quot; flavors was changed to be sweetened with sucralose. In the Netherlands the flavors mint, licorice and fruit are also available in the sugar-free variety.

Australian varieties of Mentos are Fruit, Rainbow, Mint, Spearmint, Soft Drink and Smoothies.

The UK has five current flavors of rolls:
*Fruit (Orange, Lemon and Strawberry)
*Mint
*Rainbow (with 2 dragees each of: Strawberry, Apple, Raspberry, Orange, Watermelon, Blueberry and Pink Grapefruit (the last two were new flavors for 2015, replacing Grape and Pineapple).
*Spearmint
*Discovery (with 14 different flavours: Passionfruit, Lychee, Blackcurrant, Blueberry, Lime, Strawberry, Raspberry, Orange, Lemon, Watermelon, Banana, Grape, Cherry and Pineapple; always appearing in that order).
*Tutti-Frutti - bubblegum flavored - new for 2012.
*Fanta flavour (orange flavoured but a stronger more juicy flavour than standard orange)

In the UK, Mentos Gum is also available in stick packs (peppermint, spearmint, pure white, air action (menthol) and fruit), Bottles (spearmint, peppermint and red fruit - which retails for approximately £0.99), as well as flip top boxes. Flavors include peppermint or spearmint with green tea extract, and a pure white with white tea extract. Sugar free versions are available, but these are rarer to find, usually only found in large supermarkets. Mentos gum holds a 4% market share of the UK gum market. A new Mentos 3 was launched in January 2011, in two flavors - mint and Strawberry/Apple/Raspberry, which are similar to Wrigleys&#x27; 5 in packaging. A new blackberry/kiwi/strawberry version was released into the UK market in January 2012.

In Greece, Mentos are very popular, and are available in the following flavors:
*Mint
*Strawberry
*Melon
*Watermelon
*Fruit (Orange, lemon and strawberry)
*Energy (each roll is equivalent to 2 cups of coffee)
*Mentos gum in Bottles
*Mentos Cube
*Mentos in Boxes (mint and Fruit).

Mini Mentos, somewhat smaller than ordinary Mentos, are available in the Netherlands in two varieties: Mini Mentos Fruitmix, which contains the flavors orange, lemon, strawberry and apple, and Mini Mentos Yoghurt, with the flavors strawberry yogurt, raspberry yogurt and blueberry yogurt. Also sold is Mentos KIDZ, a bag with 12 boxes containing 10 miniature candies, in the flavors strawberry, orange, lemon, apple and blueberry.

&quot;Mentos Teens&quot; is available in Brazil and the rest of Latin America. They come in a rectangular box. The mint is basically miniature Mentos roughly the size of Skittles, and they come in mixed flavors: white grape (green), lemon (yellow), strawberry (pink), orange (orange), raspberry (blue), and cherry (red).

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup, a Brazilian team Mentos was released in Brazil to support the national team. The mint was green apple and orange flavors.

In some countries, the Mentos Ice candy can be bought in flavors such as, cherry (red), green apple (green) and grape (purple).

Ume, Fuji apple, and Pine Fresh (pineapple) Mentos are sold exclusively in Japan.

Flavors only available in certain countries;
Enigma (Czech Republic)
Rainbow (UK and US)
Ume (Japan)
Fuji Apple (Japan)
Pine Fresh (Japan)
Ice (Canada)

==Marketing==
Part of Mentos&#x27;s popularity in the US and Canada can be attributed to its campy TV commercials and catchy jingle, which debuted in late 1991 and were used well into 2001 on American and Canadian television. Individuals facing various day-to-day dilemmas consume Mentos and are subsequently inspired to solve their problems at hand in a creative, often-humorous fashion. For example, a job interviewee sits on a freshly painted bench, staining his suit, and then solves the problem by rolling around on the bench until his suit has pinstripes. Another features a woman whose parked car is boxed in; she calls a crew of construction workers over who lift her car onto the road for her. These unusual behaviors are typically witnessed by nearby, sometimes antagonistic characters, and a roll of Mentos is boisterously displayed by the commercial&#x27;s respective protagonist to the observer as an explanation for their actions. 

The ad campaign was parodied in multiple television shows and music videos, including the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Big Me&quot;.

==Reaction with carbonated beverages ==

First publicly demonstrated by chemistry teacher Lee Marek on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on September 14, 1999, and later popularized in a June 2006 viral Internet video by Eepybird, a Mentos mint expedites a rapid release of carbon dioxide when dropped into a carbonated liquid, such as a soft drink. &quot;MythBusters&quot; concluded that the potassium benzoate, aspartame, and CO2 gas contained in the Diet Coke, in combination with the gelatin and gum arabic ingredients of the Mentos, all contribute to the formation of the foam. However, kinetic experiments with various candies have shown that the presence of gelatin and gum arabic in candies does not enhance the fountain. Rather, it is the physical structure of candies that conveys the fountain effect.

The structure of the Mentos is the most significant cause of the eruption due to nucleation. &quot;MythBusters&quot; reported that when fruit-flavored Mentos with a smooth waxy coating were tested in carbonated drink there was hardly a reaction, whereas mint-flavored Mentos (with no such coating) added to carbonated drink formed an energetic eruption, supporting the nucleation-site theory. According to &quot;MythBusters&quot;, the surface of the mint Mentos is covered with many small holes that increase the surface area available for reaction (and thus the quantity of reagents exposed to each other at any given time), thereby allowing CO2 bubbles to form with the rapidity and quantity necessary for the &quot;jet&quot;-, &quot;geyser&quot;-, or &quot;eruption&quot;-like nature of the effusion.

This hypothesis gained further support when rock salt was used as a &quot;jump start&quot; to the reaction. A paper by Tonya Coffey, a physicist at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, confirmed that the rough surface of the Mentos candy helps speed the reaction. Coffey also found that the aspartame in diet soda lowers the surface tension and causes a bigger reaction, but that caffeine does not accelerate the reaction. On the other hand, it has been shown that a wide variety of beverage additives such as sugars, citric acid, and natural flavors also enhance fountain heights. In some cases, dissolved solids that &quot;increase&quot; the surface tension of water (such as sugars) also increase fountain heights. These results suggest that additives serve to enhance geyser heights not by decreasing surface tension, but rather by decreasing bubble coalescence. Decreased bubble coalescence leads to smaller bubble sizes and greater foaming ability in water.

A Guinness World Record of 2,865 simultaneous geysers was set on 17 October 2010, in an event organized by Perfetti Van Melle (Philippines) at the SM Mall of Asia Complex, in Manila, Philippines. This record was afterwards beaten in November 2014 by another event organized by Perfetti Van Melle and Chupa Chups in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico where 4,334 Mentos and soda fountains were set off simultaneously.

The resulting geyser can shoot as high as . The unofficial record, reached in &quot;MythBusters&quot;, was over with the use of a nozzle.

<doc id="664475" wikidata="Q4824713" url="?curid=664475" title="Australian Stock Car Auto Racing">
<text>AUSCAR (Australian Stock Car Auto Racing) was an auto racing sanctioning body owned by Bob Jane, which ran American-style Superspeedway racing in Australia. The initial AUSCAR venue was the 1.801 km (1.119 mi), high-banked (24°) Calder Park Thunderdome Superspeedway in Melbourne, but over time the series expanded to include the Jane owned 1/2 mile (805 metre) Speedway Super Bowl at the eastern end of Adelaide International Raceway which first saw AUSCAR racing in 1990 (the Super Bowl was only other paved oval circuit in Australia with only 7° banking in the corners making it essentially a traditional flat track), the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit, and eventually several Australian road racing circuits including Calder Park&#x27;s road course and the Oran Park Raceway in Sydney where racing was held under lights on the short version of the circuit. In the early 1990s, Jane and television station Channel 7 announced plans to turn the old Granville Showground trotting track which circled the Parramatta Speedway in Sydney into a paved, banked 1/2 mile track, but this did not happen.

Four categories of racing car were developed to run on the Australian circuits:

* NASCAR: imported and locally developed versions of the American race cars. Engines were 6.0L V8s
* AUSCAR: down spec-ed cars, closer to production specification with a control road tyre, The category comprised the Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon. After 1990/91, engines were restricted to 5.0L V8s.
* Formula Falcon: Lasted the one season and was absorbed into Sportsman, ran the Ford Falcon.
* Sportsman: lower specification again, cheaper to buy or build and older cars, and some former AUSCARs. Like AUSCAR, the category comprised the Commodore and Falcon. Engine restrictions saw Holdens use the 4.2L 253 V8 and Fords use de-tuned 5.0L 302 V8s.

Other categories, such as the HQs, a relatively cheap category based on the Holden HQ Kingswood powered by the 3.3L Holden red motor, were also popular at the Calder Park Thunderdome (as the HQs were Australian-made cars, like the AUSCARs they raced clockwise on the ovals). Another category was based on the American dirt track category known as Legends (similar in appearance, but unrelated to Aussie Racing Cars). Open-wheel cars such as Formula Vee also raced on occasion at the Thunderdome as a support to the NASCAR / AUSCAR races, as did the Dirt track racing Grand Nationals for a few meetings in 1990.

==AUSCAR category==
AUSCAR was also the name used for the second tier racing category that raced alongside the Australian NASCAR stock car racing series, starting in 1988 and continuing until 2001. The cars were not pure space frame chassis like NASCAR, but were built on Australian Holden Commodore and Ford Falcon road car chassis. As a result, AUSCARs are right-hand-drive and race clockwise on oval tracks, compared to the left-hand-drive, anticlockwise NASCAR vehicles - the theory being that the driver is located at the furthest point possible from the outside retaining walls. AUSCARs were also restricted to running 5.0 litre Holden and Ford V8 engines, though initially the Ford XF Falcons used the 5.8L 351 Cleveland V8 engines (despite the road going XFs not carrying the V8 as Ford Australia had stopped production of the engine in 1983), but subsequent Falcons (from the EB model which in 1991 re-introduced the Ford V8 to the Australian market for the first time in 8 years) would run the 5.0L V8. Commodore teams were also free to use the Group A size 4.9L Holden V8 engine, though unlike in Group A racing using the 4.9L engine did not come with an overall weight reduction for the car. As the Group A engine also cost more, all Holden competitors stuck with the 5.0L engines.

The 5.0L AUSCAR engines were strictly controlled and developed around compared to the of the larger and more highly developed, 366 cubic inch (6.0L) engines used in NASCAR, and as a result AUSCARs were slower than their American counterparts (at the Thunderdome, NASCAR stock cars were capable of around while AUSCARs had a top speed of approximately ). Like the NASCAR engines of the time, the engines used in AUSCAR were carbureted rather than having fuel injection like the road going V8s used by Holden and Ford. AUSCARs also used a Goodyear Eagle control road tyre that was buffed down (leaving only around 2mm of tread) and relatively narrow compared the wide, purpose built slick racing tyres used in NASCAR. One thing in AUSCARs&#x27; favour was that they only weighed in at compared to the NASCAR stock cars. Although they weighed less, as a result of using smaller, less powerful engines and the road tyre, AUSCARs were generally around , or around four seconds per lap, slower than the NASCAR stock cars around the Thunderdome.

Tony Kavich won the first ever AUSCAR championship in 1988. However, in a shock to the male dominated motor racing establishment, the first ever AUSCAR race at the Thunderdome (which was also the first race to exclusively use the track), the aptly named AUSCAR 200, was won by 18-year-old Melbourne based female driver Terri Sawyer driving a Holden VK Commodore. Sawyer had qualified her Commodore on the front row of the grid and ran at or near the front all day to win from Kim Jane (the nephew of Calder owner Bob Jane), Max de Jersey, Phil Brock and Graham Smith. For the first AUSCAR race, all cars were either the VK or VL Commodore, the XF Falcons not appearing until the 2nd meeting. Greg East driving a VK Commodore sat on pole for the AUSCAR 200 with a time of 33.2 seconds for an average speed of 121.34 mp/h.

While Sawyer would remain very competitive in the early years of the category, the early days were dominated by Jim Richards in his XF Falcon. Though it was Albury panel shop owner and Group E/Group A driver Brad Jones who would come to dominate the category, winning five consecutive titles during the peak of the series popularity, all in various model Commodores. Other notable drivers include: Greg East, Steve Harrington, Mark Seaton, Marshall J. Brewer, Gregg Hansford, Terry Wyhoon, Garry Rogers, Russell Ingall, John Faulkner, Steven Richards (the son of inaugural champion Jim), Tony Kavich, Nathan Pretty and his sister Nicole, Jason Whylie, Eddie Abelnecia and Leigh Watkins who was the only driver to win the championship driving a Falcon. Even Australian touring car legend Peter Brock briefly tried AUSCAR in 1988 driving an XF Falcon (after his 1987 split with Holden). Brock qualified 3rd for his first race, the 1988 Goodyear AUSCAR 200 and actually led for a number of laps until a split radiator saw him spin into retirement. To his credit, Brock later admitted that he wasn&#x27;t comfortable racing on the high-speed ovals and his time in the category only lasted a couple of meetings. He did return however for his testimonial race meeting held on the Calder Park short (road) circuit in 1995 driving a VR Commodore.

Due to the returning popularity of the Australian Touring Car Championship, relaunched as V8 Supercars in 1997, as well as financial difficulties and other problems such as Bob Jane&#x27;s long-running &quot;feud&quot; with the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS), which saw CAMS ban its members from competing in the series, robbing it of a number of leading drivers, AUSCAR was quietly shut down and the drivers dispersed into other national racing series.

Several cars were converted to Future Tourers to race in that series from 1999 onwards, some AUSCARs that did not compete in Future Tourers were restored and now compete in Stock Cars Australia competition, such examples being the #6 Ford Falcon and the #22 Holden Commodore.

<text>The Ferrari F50 (Type F130) is a limited production mid-engine sports car manufactured by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari from 1995 until 1997. Introduced in 1995, the car is a two-door, two seat targa top. The F50 is powered by a 4.7 L naturally aspirated &quot;Tipo F130B&quot; 60-valve V12 engine that was developed from the 3.5 L V12 used in the 1990 Ferrari 641 Formula One car. The car&#x27;s design is an evolution of the 1989 Ferrari Mythos concept car.

A total of 349 cars were made, with the last car rolling off the production line in July 1997. The F50&#x27;s engine predated the car; it was used in the Ferrari 333 SP for the American IMSA GT Championship in 1994, allowing it to become eligible for the stock engine World Sports Car category.

==Ferrari F50 GT==


Ferrari developed the F50 based F50 GT in collaboration with its racing partners Dallara and Michelotto to compete in GT1-class racing, following the motorsport theme of the Ferrari F40 LM. Notable changes made to the car include a fixed roof, a large rear spoiler, new front spoiler, adjustable suspension system, Speedline racing alloy wheels with racing slicks and large rear diffusers. The 4.7-litre V12 engine in the F50 GT was tuned-up to generate a power output of around at 10,500 rpm. A test was held in 1996 which proved the car to be quicker than even the 333SP, but this went unnoticed as Ferrari cancelled the F50 GT project due to entry of purpose built racing cars in competition such as the Porsche 911 GT1 and due to lack of funding, instead focusing on Formula One after the BPR Global GT Series folded. Only 3 examples were ever built, with the three remaining tubs reportedly destroyed.

<text>The Nova Scotia House of Assembly (; ), or Legislative Assembly, is the deliberative assembly of the General Assembly of Nova Scotia, and together with the lieutenant governor of Nova Scotia makes up the Nova Scotia Legislature.

The assembly is the oldest in Canada, having first sat in 1758; in 1848, it was the site of the first responsible government in the British Empire. Bills passed by the House of Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor in the name of the King of Canada.

Originally (in 1758), the Legislature consisted of the Crown represented by a governor (later a lieutenant governor), the appointed Nova Scotia Council holding both executive and legislative duties and an elected House of Assembly (lower chamber). In 1838, the council was replaced by an executive council with the executive function and a legislative council with the legislative functions based on the House of Lords. In 1928, the Legislative Council was abolished and the members pensioned off.

There are 55 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) representing 55 electoral districts. Members nearly always represent one of the three main political parties of the province: the Nova Scotia Liberal Party, Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia, and Nova Scotia New Democratic Party.

The assembly meets in Province House. Located in Halifax, Province House is a National Historic Site and Canada&#x27;s oldest and smallest legislative building. It opened on February 11, 1819. The building was also originally home to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, and the location of the &quot;Freedom of the Press&quot; trial of Joseph Howe. Its main entrance is found on Hollis Street in Halifax.

==Officers==
A number of officers of the house are appointed in accordance with legislation passed by the house. These officers fulfil numerous functions as prescribed in the relevant legislation. There are two categories of officers:

<doc id="664488" wikidata="Q164129" url="?curid=664488" title="Reciprocal lattice">
<text>Reciprocal lattice is a concept associated with solids with translational symmetry which plays a major role in many areas such as X-ray and electron diffraction as well as the energies of electrons in a solid. It emerges from the Fourier transform of the lattice associated with the arrangement of the atoms. The &quot;direct lattice&quot; or &quot;real lattice&quot; is a periodic function in physical space, such as a crystal system (usually a Bravais lattice). The reciprocal lattice exists in the mathematical space of spatial frequencies or wavenumbers &quot;k&quot;, known as reciprocal space or &quot;k&quot; space; it is the dual of physical space considered as a vector space. In other words, the reciprocal lattice is the sublattice which is dual to the direct lattice.

The reciprocal lattice is the set of all vectors formula_1, that are wavevectors k of plane waves in the Fourier series of a spatial function whose periodicity is the same as that of a direct lattice formula_2. Each plane wave in this Fourier series has the same phase or phases that are differed by multiples of formula_3 at each direct lattice point (so essentially same phase at all the direct lattice points).

The reciprocal lattice of a reciprocal lattice is equivalent to the original direct lattice, because the defining equations are symmetrical with respect to the vectors in real and reciprocal space. Mathematically, direct and reciprocal lattice vectors represent covariant and contravariant vectors, respectively.

The Brillouin zone is a Wigner–Seitz cell of the reciprocal lattice.

== Wave-based description ==
=== Reciprocal space ===
Reciprocal space (also called -space) provides a way to visualize the results of the Fourier transform of a spatial function. It is similar in role to the frequency domain arising from the Fourier transform of a time dependent function; reciprocal space is a space over which the Fourier transform of a spatial function is represented at spatial frequencies or wavevectors of plane waves of the Fourier transform. The domain of the spatial function itself is often referred to as spatial domain or real space. In physical applications, such as crystallography, both real and reciprocal space will often each be two or three dimensional. Whereas the number of spatial dimensions of these two associated spaces will be the same, the spaces will differ in their quantity dimension, so that when the real space has the dimension length (L), its reciprocal space will have inverse length, so L−1 (the reciprocal of length).

Reciprocal space comes into play regarding waves, both classical and quantum mechanical. Because a sinusoidal plane wave with unit amplitude can be written as an oscillatory term formula_4, with initial phase formula_5, angular wavenumber formula_6 and angular frequency formula_7, it can be regarded as a function of both formula_6 and formula_9 (and the time-varying part as a function of both formula_7 and formula_11). This complementary role of formula_6 and formula_9 leads to their visualization within complementary spaces (the real space and the reciprocal space). The spatial periodicity of this wave is defined by its wavelength formula_14, where formula_15; hence the corresponding wavenumber in reciprocal space will be formula_16.

In three dimensions, the corresponding plane wave term becomes formula_17, which simplifies to formula_18 at a fixed time formula_11, where formula_20 is the position vector of a point in real space and now formula_21 is the wavevector in the three dimensional reciprocal space. (The magnitude of a wavevector is called wavenumber.) The constant formula_22 is the phase of the wavefront (a plane of a constant phase) through the origin formula_23 at time formula_11, and formula_25 is a unit normal vector to this wavefront. The wavefronts with phases formula_26, where formula_27 represents any integer, comprise a set of parallel planes, equally spaced by the wavelength formula_14.

=== Reciprocal lattice ===
In general, a geometric lattice is an infinite, regular array of vertices (points) in space, which can be modelled vectorially as a Bravais lattice. Some lattices may be skew, which means that their primary lines may not necessarily be at right angles. In reciprocal space, a reciprocal lattice is defined as the set of wavevectors formula_29 of plane waves in the Fourier series of any function formula_30 whose periodicity is compatible with that of an initial direct lattice in real space. Equivalently, a wavevector is a vertex of the reciprocal lattice if it corresponds to a plane wave in real space whose phase at any given time is the same (actually differs by formula_31 with an integer formula_27) at every direct lattice vertex.

One heuristic approach to constructing the reciprocal lattice in three dimensions is to write the position vector of a vertex of the direct lattice as formula_33, where the formula_34 are integers defining the vertex and the formula_35 are linearly independent primitive translation vectors (or shortly called primitive vectors) that are characteristic of the lattice. There is then a unique plane wave (up to a factor of negative one), whose wavefront through the origin formula_36 contains the direct lattice points at formula_37 and formula_38, and with its adjacent wavefront (whose phase differs by formula_3 or formula_40 from the former wavefront passing the origin) passing through formula_41. Its angular wavevector takes the form formula_42, where formula_43 is the unit vector perpendicular to these two adjacent wavefronts and the wavelength formula_44 must satisfy formula_45, means that formula_44 is equal to the distance between the two wavefronts. Hence by construction formula_47 and formula_48.

Cycling through the indices in turn, the same method yields three wavevectors formula_49 with formula_50, where the Kronecker delta formula_51 equals one when formula_52 and is zero otherwise. The formula_49 comprise a set of three primitive wavevectors or three primitive translation vectors for the reciprocal lattice, each of whose vertices takes the form formula_54, where the formula_55 are integers. The reciprocal lattice is also a Bravais lattice as it is formed by integer combinations of the primitive vectors, that are formula_56, formula_57, and formula_58 in this case. Simple algebra then shows that, for any plane wave with a wavevector formula_59 on the reciprocal lattice, the total phase shift formula_60 between the origin and any point formula_61 on the direct lattice is a multiple of formula_3 (that can be possibly zero if the multiplier is zero), so the phase of the plane wave with formula_59 will essentially be equal for every direct lattice vertex, in conformity with the reciprocal lattice definition above. (Although any wavevector formula_59 on the reciprocal lattice does always take this form, this derivation is motivational, rather than rigorous, because it has omitted the proof that no other possibilities exist.)

The Brillouin zone is a primitive cell (more specifically a Wigner–Seitz cell) of the reciprocal lattice, which plays an important role in solid state physics due to Bloch&#x27;s theorem. In pure mathematics, the dual space of linear forms and the dual lattice provide more abstract generalizations of reciprocal space and the reciprocal lattice.

==Mathematical description==

Assuming a three-dimensional Bravais lattice and labelling each lattice vector (a vector indicating a lattice point) by the subscript formula_65 as 3-tuple of integers,

:formula_66 where formula_67

where formula_68 is the set of integers and formula_35 is a primitive translation vector or shortly primitive vector. Taking a function formula_30 where formula_20 is a position vector from the origin formula_72 to any position, if formula_30 follows the periodicity of this lattice, e.g. the function describing the electronic density in an atomic crystal, it is useful to write formula_30 as a multi-dimensional Fourier series

:formula_75

where now the subscript formula_76, so this is a triple sum.

As formula_30 follows the periodicity of the lattice, translating formula_20 by any lattice vector formula_2 we get the same value, hence

:formula_80

Expressing the above instead in terms of their Fourier series we have
formula_81

Because equality of two Fourier series implies equality of their coefficients, formula_82, which only holds when

:formula_83 where formula_84

Mathematically, the reciprocal lattice is the set of all vectors formula_1, that are wavevectors of plane waves in the Fourier series of a spatial function whose periodicity is the same as that of a direct lattice as the set of all direct lattice point position vectors formula_2, and formula_1 satisfy this equality for all formula_2. Each plane wave in the Fourier series has the same phase (actually can be differed by a multiple of formula_3) at all the lattice point formula_2.

As shown in the section multi-dimensional Fourier series, formula_1 can be chosen in the form of formula_92 where formula_50. With this form, the reciprocal lattice as the set of all wavevectors formula_1 for the Fourier series of a spatial function which periodicity follows formula_2, is itself a Bravais lattice as it is formed by integer combinations of its own primitive translation vectors formula_96, and the reciprocal of the reciprocal lattice is the original lattice, which reveals the Pontryagin duality of their respective vector spaces. (There may be other form of formula_1. Any valid form of formula_1 results in the same reciprocal lattice.)

===Two dimensions===
For an infinite two-dimensional lattice, defined by its primitive vectors formula_99, its reciprocal lattice can be determined by generating its two reciprocal primitive vectors, through the following formulae,

:formula_100

where formula_101 is an integer and

:formula_102

Here formula_103 represents a 90 degree rotation matrix, i.e. a &quot;q&quot;uarter turn. The anti-clockwise rotation and the clockwise rotation can both be used to determine the reciprocal lattice: If formula_103 is the anti-clockwise rotation and formula_105 is the clockwise rotation, formula_106 for all vectors formula_107. Thus, using the permutation
: formula_108
we obtain
:formula_109

Notably, in a 3D space this 2D reciprocal lattice is an infinitely extended set of Bragg rods—described by Sung et al.

===Three dimensions===
For an infinite three-dimensional lattice formula_66, defined by its primitive vectors formula_111 and the subscript of integers formula_112, its reciprocal lattice formula_92 with the integer subscript formula_76 can be determined by generating its three reciprocal primitive vectors formula_96
formula_116
where formula_117 is the scalar triple product. The choice of these formula_96 is to satisfy formula_50 as the known condition (There may be other condition.) of primitive translation vectors for the reciprocal lattice derived in the heuristic approach above and the section multi-dimensional Fourier series. This choice also satisfies the requirement of the reciprocal lattice formula_82 mathematically derived above. Using column vector representation of (reciprocal) primitive vectors, the formulae above can be rewritten using matrix inversion:

:formula_121

This method appeals to the definition, and allows generalization to arbitrary dimensions. The cross product formula dominates introductory materials on crystallography.

The above definition is called the &quot;physics&quot; definition, as the factor of formula_122 comes naturally from the study of periodic structures. An essentially equivalent definition, the &quot;crystallographer&#x27;s&quot; definition, comes from defining the reciprocal lattice formula_123. which changes the reciprocal primitive vectors to be

:formula_124
and so on for the other primitive vectors. The crystallographer&#x27;s definition has the advantage that the definition of formula_56 is just the reciprocal magnitude of formula_41 in the direction of formula_127, dropping the factor of formula_122. This can simplify certain mathematical manipulations, and expresses reciprocal lattice dimensions in units of spatial frequency. It is a matter of taste which definition of the lattice is used, as long as the two are not mixed.

formula_76 is conventionally written as formula_130 or formula_131, called Miller indices; formula_132 is replaced with formula_133, formula_134 replaced with formula_6, and formula_136 replaced with formula_137. Each lattice point formula_131 in the reciprocal lattice corresponds to a set of lattice planes formula_131 in the real space lattice. (A lattice plane is a plane crossing lattice points.) The direction of the reciprocal lattice vector corresponds to the normal to the real space planes. The magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector formula_140 is given in reciprocal length and is equal to the reciprocal of the interplanar spacing of the real space planes.

===Higher dimensions===
The formula for formula_27 dimensions can be derived assuming an formula_27-dimensional real vector space formula_143 with a basis formula_144 and an inner product formula_145. The reciprocal lattice vectors are uniquely determined by the formula formula_146. Using the permutation
: formula_147
they can be determined with the following formula:
:formula_148
Here, formula_149 is the volume form, formula_150 is the inverse of the vector space isomorphism formula_151 defined by formula_152 and formula_153 denotes the inner multiplication.

One can verify that this formula is equivalent to the known formulas for the two- and three-dimensional case by using the following facts: In three dimensions, formula_154 and in two dimensions, formula_155, where formula_156 is the rotation by 90 degrees (just like the volume form, the angle assigned to a rotation depends on the choice of orientation).

== Reciprocal lattices of various crystals ==

Reciprocal lattices for the cubic crystal system are as follows.

===Simple cubic lattice===

The simple cubic Bravais lattice, with cubic primitive cell of side formula_157, has for its reciprocal a simple cubic lattice with a cubic primitive cell of side formula_158 (or formula_159 in the crystallographer&#x27;s definition). The cubic lattice is therefore said to be self-dual, having the same symmetry in reciprocal space as in real space.

===Face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice===

The reciprocal lattice to an FCC lattice is the body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, with a cube side of formula_160.

Consider an FCC compound unit cell. Locate a primitive unit cell of the FCC; i.e., a unit cell with one lattice point. Now take one of the vertices of the primitive unit cell as the origin. Give the basis vectors of the real lattice. Then from the known formulae, you can calculate the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice. These reciprocal lattice vectors of the FCC represent the basis vectors of a BCC real lattice. The basis vectors of a real BCC lattice and the reciprocal lattice of an FCC resemble each other in direction but not in magnitude.

===Body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice===

The reciprocal lattice to a BCC lattice is the FCC lattice, with a cube side of formula_161.

It can be proven that only the Bravais lattices which have 90 degrees between formula_162 (cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic) have primitive translation vectors for the reciprocal lattice, formula_163, parallel to their real-space vectors.

===Simple hexagonal lattice===

The reciprocal to a simple hexagonal Bravais lattice with lattice constants formula_164 and formula_165 is another simple hexagonal lattice with lattice constants formula_166 and formula_167 rotated through 90° about the &quot;c&quot; axis with respect to the direct lattice. The simple hexagonal lattice is therefore said to be self-dual, having the same symmetry in reciprocal space as in real space. Primitive translation vectors for this simple hexagonal Bravais lattice vectors are
formula_168

==Arbitrary collection of atoms==

One path to the reciprocal lattice of an arbitrary collection of atoms comes from the idea of scattered waves in the Fraunhofer (long-distance or lens back-focal-plane) limit as a Huygens-style sum of amplitudes from all points of scattering (in this case from each individual atom). This sum is denoted by the complex amplitude formula_169 in the equation below, because it is also the Fourier transform (as a function of spatial frequency or reciprocal distance) of an effective scattering potential in direct space:

:formula_170

Here g = q/(2) is the scattering vector q in crystallographer units, &quot;N&quot; is the number of atoms, &quot;f&quot;&quot;j&quot;[g] is the atomic scattering factor for atom &quot;j&quot; and scattering vector g, while r&quot;j&quot; is the vector position of atom &quot;j&quot;. The Fourier phase depends on one&#x27;s choice of coordinate origin.

For the special case of an infinite periodic crystal, the scattered amplitude &quot;F&quot; = &quot;M&quot; &quot;Fh,k,ℓ&quot; from &quot;M&quot; unit cells (as in the cases above) turns out to be non-zero only for integer values of formula_171, where

:formula_172

when there are &quot;j&quot; = 1,&quot;m&quot; atoms inside the unit cell whose fractional lattice indices are respectively {&quot;u&quot;&quot;j&quot;, &quot;v&quot;&quot;j&quot;, &quot;w&quot;&quot;j&quot;}. To consider effects due to finite crystal size, of course, a shape convolution for each point or the equation above for a finite lattice must be used instead.

Whether the array of atoms is finite or infinite, one can also imagine an &quot;intensity reciprocal lattice&quot; I[g], which relates to the amplitude lattice F via the usual relation &quot;I&quot; = &quot;F&quot;*&quot;F&quot; where &quot;F&quot;* is the complex conjugate of F. Since Fourier transformation is reversible, of course, this act of conversion to intensity tosses out &quot;all except 2nd moment&quot; (i.e. the phase) information. For the case of an arbitrary collection of atoms, the intensity reciprocal lattice is therefore:

:formula_173

Here r&quot;jk&quot; is the vector separation between atom &quot;j&quot; and atom &quot;k&quot;. One can also use this to predict the effect of nano-crystallite shape, and subtle changes in beam orientation, on detected diffraction peaks even if in some directions the cluster is only one atom thick. On the down side, scattering calculations using the reciprocal lattice basically consider an incident plane wave. Thus after a first look at reciprocal lattice (kinematic scattering) effects, beam broadening and multiple scattering (i.e. dynamical) effects may be important to consider as well.

==Generalization of a dual lattice==

There are actually two versions in mathematics of the abstract dual lattice concept, for a given lattice &quot;L&quot; in a real vector space &quot;V&quot;, of finite dimension.

The first, which generalises directly the reciprocal lattice construction, uses Fourier analysis. It may be stated simply in terms of Pontryagin duality. The dual group &quot;V&quot;^ to &quot;V&quot; is again a real vector space, and its closed subgroup &quot;L&quot;^ dual to &quot;L&quot; turns out to be a lattice in &quot;V&quot;^. Therefore, &quot;L&quot;^ is the natural candidate for &quot;dual lattice&quot;, in a different vector space (of the same dimension).

The other aspect is seen in the presence of a quadratic form &quot;Q&quot; on &quot;V&quot;; if it is non-degenerate it allows an identification of the dual space &quot;V&quot;* of &quot;V&quot; with &quot;V&quot;. The relation of &quot;V&quot;* to &quot;V&quot; is not intrinsic; it depends on a choice of Haar measure (volume element) on &quot;V&quot;. But given an identification of the two, which is in any case well-defined up to a scalar, the presence of &quot;Q&quot; allows one to speak to the dual lattice to &quot;L&quot; while staying within &quot;V&quot;.

In mathematics, the dual lattice of a given lattice &quot;L&quot; in an abelian locally compact topological group &quot;G&quot; is the subgroup &quot;L&quot;∗ of the dual group of &quot;G&quot; consisting of all continuous characters that are equal to one at each point of &quot;L&quot;.

In discrete mathematics, a lattice is a locally discrete set of points described by all integral linear combinations of linearly independent vectors in R&quot;n&quot;. The dual lattice is then defined by all points in the linear span of the original lattice (typically all of R&quot;n&quot;) with the property that an integer results from the inner product with all elements of the original lattice. It follows that the dual of the dual lattice is the original lattice.

Furthermore, if we allow the matrix &quot;B&quot; to have columns as the linearly independent vectors that describe the lattice, then the matrix formula_174 has columns of vectors that describe the dual lattice.

==In quantum physics==
In quantum physics, reciprocal space is closely related to &quot;momentum space&quot; according to the proportionality formula_175, where formula_176 is the momentum vector and formula_177 is the reduced Planck constant.

<text>The Lawrence Textile Strike, also known as the Bread and Roses Strike, was a strike of immigrant workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912 led by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Prompted by a two-hour pay cut corresponding to a new law shortening the workweek for women, the strike spread rapidly through the town, growing to more than twenty thousand workers and involving nearly every mill in Lawrence. On January 1, 1912, the Massachusetts government enforced a law that cut mill workers&#x27; hours in a single work week from 56 hours, to 54 hours. Ten days later, they found out that pay had been reduced along with the cut in hours.
The strike united workers from more than 51 different nationalities. A large portion of the striking workers, including many of the leaders of the strike, were Italian immigrants. Carried on throughout a brutally cold winter, the strike lasted more than two months, from January to March, defying the assumptions of conservative trade unions within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) that immigrant, largely female and ethnically divided workers could not be organized. In late January, when a striker, Anna LoPizzo, was killed by police during a protest, IWW organizers Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti were framed and arrested on charges of being accessories to the murder.
IWW leaders Bill Haywood and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn came to Lawrence to run the strike. Together they masterminded its signature move, sending hundreds of the strikers&#x27; hungry children to sympathetic families in New York, New Jersey, and Vermont. The move drew widespread sympathy, especially after police stopped a further exodus, leading to violence at the Lawrence train station. Congressional hearings followed, resulting in exposure of shocking conditions in the Lawrence mills and calls for investigation of the &quot;wool trust.&quot; Mill owners soon decided to settle the strike, giving workers in Lawrence and throughout New England raises of up to 20 percent. Within a year, however, the IWW had largely collapsed in Lawrence.

The Lawrence strike is often referred to as the &quot;Bread and Roses&quot; strike. It has also been called the &quot;strike for three loaves&quot;. The phrase &quot;bread and roses&quot; actually preceded the strike, appearing in a poem by James Oppenheim published in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in December 1911. A 1915 labor anthology, &quot;The Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest&quot; by Upton Sinclair, attributed the phrase to the Lawrence strike, and the association stuck. A popular rallying cry from the poem was interwoven with the memory of the strike: &quot;Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses!&quot;

==Background==

Founded in 1845, Lawrence was a flourishing but deeply-troubled textile city. By 1900, mechanization and the deskilling of labor in the textile industry enabled factory owners to eliminate skilled workers and to employ large numbers of unskilled immigrant workers, mostly women. Work in a textile mill took place at a grueling pace, and the labor was repetitive and dangerous. About one third of workers in the Lawrence textile mills died before the age of 25. In addition, a number of children under 14 worked in the mills. Half of the workers in the four Lawrence mills of the American Woolen Company, the leading employer in the industry and the town, were females between 14 and 18. Falsification of birth certificates, allowing for girls younger than 14 to work, was common practice at the time. Lawrence had the 5th highest child mortality rate of any city in the country at the time, behind four other mill towns in Massachusetts (Lowell, Fall River, Worcester, and Holyoke).

By 1912, the Lawrence mills at maximum capacity employed about 32,000 men, women, and children. Conditions had worsened even more in the decade before the strike. The introduction of the two-loom system in the woolen mills led to a dramatic increase in the pace of work. The greater production enabled the factory owners to lay off large numbers of workers. Those who kept their jobs earned, on average, $8.76 for 56 hours of work and $9.00 for 60 hours of work.
Some of the mills, worker housing and part of the town was owned by American Woolen Company president William Wood, who said he could not afford to pay his workers for the two hours per week they were cut, even though the company had made a profit of $3,000,000 (~$ in ) in 1911.

The workers in Lawrence lived in crowded and dangerous apartment buildings, often with many families sharing each apartment. Many families survived on bread, molasses, and beans; as one worker testified before the March 1912 congressional investigation of the Lawrence strike, &quot;When we eat meat it seems like a holiday, especially for the children.&quot; Half of children died before they were six, and 36% of the adults who worked in the mill died before they were 25. The average life expectancy was 39.

The mills and the community were divided along ethnic lines: most of the skilled jobs were held by native-born workers of English, Irish, and German descent, whereas French-Canadian, Italian, Jewish, Slavic, Hungarian, Portuguese, and Syrian immigrants made up most of the unskilled workforce. Several thousand skilled workers belonged, in theory at least, to the American Federation of Labor-affiliated United Textile Workers, but only a few hundred paid dues. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) had also been organizing for five years among workers in Lawrence but also had only a few hundred actual members.

==Strike==
On January 1, 1912, a new labor law took effect in Massachusetts reducing the working week of 56 hours to 54 hours for women and children. Workers opposed the reduction if it reduced their weekly take-home pay. The first two weeks of 1912, the unions tried to learn how the owners of the mills would deal with the new law. On January 11, a group of Polish women textile workers in Lawrence discovered that their employer at the Everett Mill had reduced about $0.32 from their total wages and walked out.

On January 12, workers in the Washington Mill of the American Woolen Company also found that their wages had been cut. Prepared for the events by weeks of discussion, they walked out, calling &quot;short pay, all out.&quot;

Joseph Ettor of the IWW had been organizing in Lawrence for some time before the strike; he and Arturo Giovannitti of the Italian Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America quickly assumed leadership of the strike by forming a strike committee of 56 people, four representatives of fourteen nationalities, which took responsibility for all major decisions. The committee, which arranged for its strike meetings to be translated into 25 different languages, put forward a set of demands: a 15% increase in wages for a 54-hour work week, double pay for overtime work, and no discrimination against workers for their strike activity.

The city responded to the strike by ringing the city&#x27;s alarm bell for the first time in its history; the mayor ordered a company of the local militia to patrol the streets. When mill owners turned fire hoses on the picketers gathered in front of the mills, they responded by throwing ice at the plants, breaking a number of windows. The court sentenced 24 workers to a year in jail for throwing ice; as the judge stated, &quot;The only way we can teach them is to deal out the severest sentences.&quot; Governor Eugene Foss then ordered out the state militia and state police. Mass arrests followed.

At the same time, the United Textile Workers (UTW) attempted to break the strike by claiming to speak for the workers of Lawrence. The striking operatives ignored the UTW, as the IWW had successfully united the operatives behind ethnic-based leaders, who were members of the strike committee and able to communicate Ettor&#x27;s message to avoid violence at demonstrations. Ettor did not consider intimidating operatives who were trying to enter the mills as breaking the peace.
The IWW was successful, even with AFL-affiliated operatives, as it defended the grievances of all operatives from all the mills. Conversely, the AFL and the mill owners preferred to keep negotiations between separate mills and their own operatives. However, in a move that frustrated the UTW, Oliver Christian, the national secretary of the Loomfixers Association and an AFL affiliate itself, said he believed John Golden, the Massachusetts-based UTW president, was a detriment to the cause of labor. That statement and missteps by William Madison Wood quickly shifted public sentiment to favor the strikers.

A local undertaker and a member of the Lawrence school board attempted to frame the strike leadership by planting dynamite in several locations in town a week after the strike began. He was fined $500 and released without jail time. Later, William M. Wood, the president of the American Woolen Company, was shown to have made an unexplained large payment to the defendant shortly before the dynamite was found.

The authorities later charged Ettor and Giovannitti as accomplices to murder for the death of striker Anna LoPizzo, who was likely shot by the police. Ettor and Giovannitti had been away, where they spoke to another group of workers. They and a third defendant, who had not even heard of either Ettor or Giovannitti at the time of his arrest, were held in jail for the duration of the strike and several months thereafter. The authorities declared martial law, banned all public meetings, and called out 22 more militia companies to patrol the streets. Harvard students were even given exemptions from their final exams if they agreed to go and try to break up the strike. 

The IWW responded by sending Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and a number of other organizers to Lawrence. Haywood participated little in the daily affairs of the strike. Instead, he set out for other New England textile towns in an effort to raise funds for the strikers in Lawrence, which proved very successful. Other tactics established were an efficient system of relief committees, soup kitchens, and food distribution stations, and volunteer doctors provided medical care. The IWW raised funds on a nationwide basis to provide weekly benefits for strikers and dramatized the strikers&#x27; needs by arranging for several hundred children to go to supporters&#x27; homes in New York City for the duration of the strike. When city authorities tried to prevent another 100 children from going to Philadelphia on February 24 by sending police and the militia to the station to detain the children and arrest their parents, the police began clubbing both the children and their mothers and dragged them off to be taken away by truck; one pregnant mother miscarried. The press, there to photograph the event, reported extensively on the attack. Moreover, when the women and children were taken to the Police Court, most of them refused to pay the fines levied and opted for a jail cell, some with babies in arms.

The police action against the mothers and children of Lawrence attracted the attention of the nation, in particular that of first lady Helen Herron Taft, wife of President William Howard Taft. Soon, both the House and the Senate set out to investigate the strike. In the early days of March, a special House Committee heard testimony from some of the strikers&#x27; children, as well as various city, state and union officials. In the end, both chambers published reports detailing the conditions at Lawrence.

The children involved in the police riot were not only the children of striking workers, they were also striking workers themselves. Most of the workers at the mill were women and children. Families were suffering not only from the lost income of adult workers, but also the lost wages of children. 
Children were used several times during the strike to attract attention to the cause. On February 10, 119 children were sent to Manhattan to live with relatives, or strangers, who were able to feed them to alleviate the financial strain on the striking families. The children were welcomed in NY by cheering crowds that drew national attention. When another group of children were sent to NY, they were paraded down 5th Avenue, drawing even more attention. Embarrassed by the bad publicity, the city marshal tried to deter the next group of children that were being sent to Philadelphia on February 24, with disastrous results. Police attempted to stop the children from boarding the train and as mothers tried to force their children on board, police intervened with clubs and arrested parents and children, the latter being ferried out of the town to an orphanage. The next role that children played in the result of the strike was the testimony they gave about the working conditions in the factories. Most notable was that of Carmela Teoli, a 14-year-old mill worker who testified in front of a Congressional hearing. Teoli had been hospitalized for seven months after the cotton-twisting machine she operated had pulled her scalp off. The company paid her hospital bills, but did not provide her with sick pay. The national sympathy that children elicited changed the outcome of the strike.

Children of the mill workers were brought to homes of supporters of the Lawrence textile strike. With the aid of Haywood and Flynn, these two individuals organized a way for donations for the children of strikers. In addition, the children began to form strike rallies to demonstrate the hardship and struggle occurring in the Lawrence mill factories. Strikes happened from Vermont all the way to New York City; those children fought to be seen and heard where they went.

The national attention had an effect: the owners offered a 5% pay raise on March 1, but the workers rejected it. American Woolen Company agreed to most of the strikers&#x27; demands on March 12, 1912. The strikers had demanded an end to the Premium System in which a portion of their earnings were subject to month-long production and attendance standards. The mill owners&#x27; concession was to change the award of the premium from once every four weeks to once every two weeks. The rest of the manufacturers followed by the end of the month; other textile companies throughout New England, anxious to avoid a similar confrontation, then followed suit.

The children who had been taken in by supporters in New York City came home on March 30.

==Aftermath==

Ettor and Giovanniti, both members of IWW, remained in prison for months after the strike was over. Haywood threatened a general strike to demand their freedom, with the cry &quot;Open the jail gates or we will close the mill gates.&quot; The IWW raised $60,000 for their defense and held demonstrations and mass meetings throughout the country in their support; the Boston authorities arrested all of the members of the Ettor and Giovannitti Defense Committee. On March 10, 1912, an estimated 10,000 protestors gathered in Lawrence demanding the release of Ettor and Giovannitti. Then, 15,000 Lawrence workers went on strike for one day on September 30 to demand the release of Ettor and Giovannitti. Swedish and French workers proposed a boycott of woolen goods from the US and a refusal to load ships going there, and Italian supporters of the Giovannitti men rallied in front of the US consulate in Rome.

In the meantime, Ernest Pitman, a Lawrence building contractor who had done extensive work for the American Woolen Company, confessed to a district attorney that he had attended a meeting in the Boston offices of Lawrence textile companies, where the plan to frame the union by planting dynamite had been made. Pitman committed suicide shortly thereafter when he was subpoenaed to testify. Wood, the American Woolen Company owner, was formally exonerated.

When the trial of Ettor and Giovannitti, as well as a third defendant, Giuseppe Caruso, accused of firing the shot that killed the picketer, began in September 1912 in Salem before Judge Joseph F. Quinn, the three defendants were kept in steel cages in the courtroom. All witnesses testified that Ettor and Giovannitti were miles away and that Caruso, the third defendant, was at home and eating supper at the time of the killing.

Ettor and Giovannitti both delivered closing statements at the end of the two-month trial. In Ettor&#x27;s closing statement, he turned and faced the District Attorney:

Does Mr. Ateill believe for a moment that... the cross or the gallows or the guillotine, the hangman&#x27;s noose, ever settled an idea? It never did. If an idea can live, it lives because history adjudges it right. And what has been considered an idea constituting a social crime in one age has in the next age become the religion of humanity. Whatever my social views are, they are what they are. They cannot be tried in this courtroom.

All three defendants were acquitted on November 26, 1912.

The strikers, however, lost nearly all of the gains they had won in the next few years. The IWW, disdaining written contracts as encouraging workers to abandon the daily class struggle, thus left the mill owners to chisel away at the improvements in wages and working conditions, to fire union activists, and to install labor spies to keep an eye on workers. The more persistent owners laid off further employees during a depression in the industry.

By then, the IWW had turned its attention to supporting the silk industry workers in Paterson, New Jersey. The Paterson Silk Strike of 1913 was defeated.

==Casualties==

The strike had at least three casualties:
* Anna LoPizzo, an Italian immigrant, who was shot in the chest during a clash between strikers and police
* John Ramey, a Syrian youth who was bayoneted to death in the back by the militia
* Jonas Smolskas, a Lithuanian immigrant who was beaten to death several months after the strike ended for wearing a pro-labor pin on his lapel

==Conclusion and legacy==
After the strike concluded, workers received a few of the demands established between mill workers and owners. Some workers went back to work at the mills and &quot;others came and went, trying to find other jobs, failing, returning again to the music of the power loom&quot;. Even after the strike was finished, there were many other strikes that occurred in other states involving various mill factories. &quot;On January 12, 1913, the IWW held anniversary celebration in Lawrence&quot; which was one of the last celebrations for a couple of years. 

Eugene Debs said of the strike, &quot;The Victory at Lawrence was the most decisive and far-reaching ever won by organized labor.&quot; Author Peter Carlson saw this strike conducted by the militant Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as a turning point. He wrote, &quot;Wary of [a war with the anti-capitalist IWW], some mill owners swallowed their hatred of unions and actually &quot;invited&quot; the AFL to organize their workers.

On February 9, 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren officially announced her candidacy for President of the United States at the site of the strike.

<text>Richard George Manuel (April 3, 1943 – March 4, 1986) was a Canadian musician, singer, and songwriter, best known as a pianist and one of three lead singers in the Band, for which he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

Manuel&#x27;s singing alternated between a soul-influenced baritone that drew frequent comparisons to Ray Charles and a delicate falsetto. Though The Band had three vocalists sharing lead and harmony parts, Manuel was sometimes seen as the group&#x27;s primary vocalist.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Manuel was born in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. His father, Ed, was a mechanic employed at a Chrysler dealership, and his mother was a schoolteacher. He was raised with his three brothers, and the four sang in the church choir. Manuel took piano lessons beginning when he was nine, and enjoyed playing piano and rehearsing with friends at home. Some of his childhood influences were Ray Charles, Bobby Bland, Jimmy Reed and Otis Rush.
Around 1957, Manuel joined The Rebels, a local Stratford band featuring guitarist John Till (later of the Full Tilt Boogie Band). With Manuel on piano and vocals and his friend Jimmy Winkler on drums, the band was rounded out by bass player Ken Kalmusky (later a founding member of Great Speckled Bird). In short order, the group changed its name to the Revols, in deference to Duane Eddy and the Rebels. Although Richard was the primary vocalist, the line up expanded to include original singer Doug &#x27;Bo&#x27; Rhodes. Guitarist Till would later be replaced by Garth Pictot.

Manuel first became acquainted with Ronnie Hawkins and the Hawks in the summer of 1960 when the Revols opened for them at Pop Ivy&#x27;s in Port Dover, Ontario. According to Levon Helm, Hawkins remarked to him about Manuel: &quot;See that kid playing piano? He&#x27;s got more talent than Van Cliburn.&quot; The following spring, Hawkins found himself opening for The Revols at Stratford Coliseum. After the show, he offered to manage the band, and sent them to play at one of his clubs, The Rockwood, in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In mid-September 1961, after the Revols returned from their southern journey, Hawkins recruited Manuel to his backing band The Hawks, replacing piano player Stan Szelest.

===The Hawks===
Manuel was 18 when he joined Hawkins&#x27;s backing group, the Hawks. At this time the band already consisted of 21-year-old Levon Helm on drums, 17-year-old Robbie Robertson on guitar and 17-year-old Rick Danko on bass; 24-year-old organist Garth Hudson joined that Christmas, followed by two temporary members (saxophonist Jerry Penfound and singer Bruce Bruno). Increasingly antagonized by Hawkins&#x27;s disdain for marijuana and contemporary music trends, the group left the singer&#x27;s employ in 1964. Initially, they were known as the Levon Helm Sextet (as Helm had accumulated the most time with Hawkins) before changing their name to the Canadian Squires and then to Levon and the Hawks. With Helm serving as nominal leader because of his longevity with the Hawkins group, it was Manuel who sang most of the songs in the group&#x27;s repertoire. It was as Levon and the Hawks, after the departure of Penfound and Bruno, that they introduced themselves to their blues hero, Sonny Boy Williamson. They planned a collaboration with Williamson, but he died before their plans could be realized.

In 1965, Helm, Hudson, and Robertson helped back American bluesman John Hammond on his album &quot;So Many Roads&quot;. Hammond recommended the Hawks to Bob Dylan, who tapped them to serve as his backing band when he switched to an electric sound; through 1966, they toured Europe and the United States with Dylan, enduring the ire of Dylan&#x27;s folk fans, who subjected the group to hissing and booing.

===The Band===

====Big Pink====
In 1967, while Dylan recovered from a motorcycle accident in Woodstock, New York, the group moved there also, renting a house clad in pink-painted asbestos siding, which became known as &quot;Big Pink&quot;, located on at 2188 Stoll Road (later 56 Parnassus Lane) in nearby West Saugerties, New York. Supported by a retainer from Dylan, they were able to experiment with a new sound garnered from the country, soul, rhythm and blues, gospel and rockabilly music that they loved. As Helm (who was disheartened by the reaction to Dylan&#x27;s new sound) had been temporarily absent from the group since late 1965, Manuel taught himself to play drums during the hiatus. In the Band era he would occasionally assume the drummer&#x27;s stool when Helm played mandolin or guitar. His loose, improvisatory drumming style was notably different from Helm&#x27;s taut, soul-influenced approach, as exemplified by his unique performances on &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot; and &quot;Evangeline&quot;.

The early months in Woodstock also allowed Manuel and Robertson to develop as songwriters. After recording numerous demos and signing with Albert Grossman, they secured a 10-album contract with Capitol Records in early 1968. They originally signed as &quot;The Crackers&quot; (although &quot;The Honkies&quot; had also been considered). Helm rejoined the fold as sessions got under way for the recording of their debut album, &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;. The group proceeded to take what they had learned with Dylan and used one of his songs in the process. They combined it with their idea of the perfect album, switching solos, and singing harmonies modeled after the gospel sound of their musical heroes The Staple Singers. Manuel stated, &quot;During the conception of &quot;Big Pink&quot;, we discovered a whole vocal thing that we weren&#x27;t aware that we&#x27;d even had before, and I remember listening to playbacks after the sessions of songs and thinking, &quot;I really like this stuff, and I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to, but I really like it, and I hope everybody else does, but I really think this is strong.&quot;

Manuel and Robertson each contributed four songs; among Manuel&#x27;s contributions was &quot;Tears of Rage,&quot; which he co-wrote with Dylan. Recordings of the country ballad &quot;Long Black Veil&quot; and Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; and the Danko–Dylan collaboration &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot; rounded out the album. &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot; was released with the group name given as simply &quot;The Band.&quot; This would be their name for the rest of the group&#x27;s existence. While reaching only No. 30 on the Billboard charts, the album would have a profound influence on the nascent country rock and roots rock movements. Shortly after the release of the album, the newly financially secure Manuel married his girlfriend, Jane Kristiansen, a model from Toronto, whom he had dated intermittently since the Hawks days. They would become the parents of two children.

====Movie role, substance abuse, move to Malibu====
In 1970, Manuel acted in the Warner Bros. film &quot;Eliza&#x27;s Horoscope&quot;, an independently distributed Canadian drama written and directed by Gordon Sheppard. He portrayed &quot;the bearded composer,&quot; performing alongside Tommy Lee Jones, former Playboy Bunny Elizabeth Moorman, and Lila Kedrova; Robertson appeared as an extra. Taking four years to complete, it was not released until 1975.

During this period, Manuel&#x27;s songs were widely recorded. &quot;Blues for Breakfast&quot; (an early Woodstock-era song) was performed by Cass Elliot on &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; (1968); shortly thereafter, Joan Baez performed an a cappella arrangement of &quot;Tears of Rage&quot; on &quot;Any Day Now&quot; (1968), Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears included a big band-inflected arrangement of &quot;Lonesome Suzie&quot; on &quot;Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears 3&quot; (1970) and Karen Dalton included her rendition of &quot;In a Station&quot; on &quot;In My Own Time&quot; (1971). He was credited with writing only three songs (&quot;When You Awake,&quot; &quot;Whispering Pines,&quot; and &quot;Jawbone&quot;) on &quot;The Band&quot; (1969) and two (&quot;Sleeping&quot; and &quot;Just Another Whistle Stop&quot;) on &quot;Stage Fright&quot; (1970); all of these songs were credited as collaborations with Robertson, who had assumed dominance in the group&#x27;s affairs with Grossman.

By &quot;Cahoots&quot; (1971), producer John Simon observed that &quot;Robbie didn&#x27;t ... consciously intimidate him ... but when you met Robbie he was so smooth and urbane and witty, whereas Richard was such a gee-golly-gosh kind of guy.&quot; The influence of Manuel&#x27;s increasing use of heroin may have also contributed to the diminution of his songwriting abilities.

Throughout 1972, Manuel&#x27;s alcoholism was one of a variety of factors (including Robertson&#x27;s own writer&#x27;s block) that began to impede The Band&#x27;s recording and performance schedule. Years later, Robertson said that Manuel &quot;scared us to death ... we didn&#x27;t know what the next day might bring, what would come out of this monster that had seeped out of the woodwork.&quot; Although Jane Manuel lamented that &quot;people thought it was amusing to watch this guy drowning,&quot; the Manuels briefly separated during this period but reconciled before the impending birth of their second child, Josh. According to Mason Hoffenberg (who roomed with him in 1972–1973 at the request of Grossman), Manuel had &quot;stopped [using heroin] and got into this drinking thing ... I&#x27;m supposed to head off all the juvenile dope dealers up here who hang around rock stars. So I answer the phone and say Richard&#x27;s not here... But if they actually come over to the house, he can&#x27;t say no. He&#x27;s brilliant, that guy. An incredible composer... The four other guys in the Band are serious about working and he&#x27;s really hanging them up. They can&#x27;t work without him and there&#x27;s no way to get him off his ass. He feels bad about it, he&#x27;s just strung out.&quot;

In 1973, the group once again followed the lead of Dylan by relocating to Malibu, California. Before leaving the Hudson Valley, they convened at Bearsville Studios to record an album of vintage rock and roll songs (some of which had been performed by The Hawks) entitled &quot;Moondog Matinee&quot;, in homage to Alan Freed&#x27;s radio show. Although Manuel was initially reluctant to perform, the album elicited some of his finest vocal performances, including renditions of the Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland R&amp;B standard &quot;Share Your Love with Me,&quot; The Platters&#x27;s &quot;The Great Pretender,&quot; and Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek gospel song &quot;Saved&quot;. Helm had this to say about Manuel during this period: &quot;[H]e was drinking pretty hard, but once he got started, man: drums, piano, play it all, sing, do a lead in one of them high, hard-assed keys to sing in. Richard just knew how a song was supposed to go. Structure, melody; he understood it.&quot;

====Back with Dylan====
The Band gradually resurfaced on the live circuit. Following a warmup show in Osaka, Japan, in July 1973, they played to receptive audiences at the Summer Jam at Watkins Glen and on a double bill with the Grateful Dead at Jersey City&#x27;s Roosevelt Stadium two days later. In the autumn, the group backed up Dylan on &quot;Planet Waves&quot;, his first full album of original songs since 1970, before serving as his backup group on his first tour in nearly eight years.

The 40 concerts of the Bob Dylan and the Band 1974 Tour, from January 3 to February 14, 1974, were meandering musical marathons featuring two sets of Dylan backed by The Band, two Band sets, and a Dylan acoustic set. The ensuing live album from the tour, &quot;Before the Flood&quot;, reveals that Manuel was still capable of reaching the falsetto on &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;.

====&quot;The Last Waltz&quot;====
The Band continued performing throughout 1974, supporting Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young alongside Joni Mitchell, Jesse Colin Young and The Beach Boys on select dates of a summer stadium tour. But with the long-germinating, Robertson-penned follow-up to &quot;Cahoots&quot; (&quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot;) still more than a year from release, the group struggled to attract audiences in certain markets, as evinced by a proposed August 1974 headlining performance at Boston Garden that was ultimately cancelled due to poor ticket sales. By 1975, Robertson had expressed his dissatisfaction with touring and was acting in an increasingly administrative capacity, as the move to Malibu and his refusal to allow the group to join Bearsville Records had seen him take the managerial reins on a de facto basis from an increasingly diffident Grossman. According to Helm, Manuel (who lived in a variety of rented houses throughout the period, including properties owned by Goldie Hawn and Keith Moon) was now consuming eight bottles of Grand Marnier every day on top of a prodigious cocaine addiction, factors that ultimately precipitated his divorce from Jane Manuel in 1976. While living in the Hawn house, Manuel attempted suicide (by self-immolation and shooting himself in the head with a BB gun) on at least two occasions.

During this period, he developed a kinship with the similarly despondent Eric Clapton and emerged as a driving force behind the sessions that make up the guitarist&#x27;s &quot;No Reason to Cry&quot; (1976). The album was recorded at the Band&#x27;s new Shangri-La Studios, where Manuel lived for about a year in a bungalow that had once served as the stable for Bamboo Harvester, the horse that portrayed the titular character on the 1960s sitcom &quot;Mister Ed&quot;. Manuel gave Clapton the song &quot;Beautiful Thing&quot; (a 1967 Band demo that Danko helped him finish) and provided vocals for &quot;Last Night.&quot;

On the group&#x27;s final full-fledged tour in the summer of 1976, Manuel was still recovering from a car accident earlier in the year; several tour dates were subsequently canceled after a power-boating accident near Austin, Texas, that necessitated the hiring of Tibetan healers, in a scenario reminiscent of Robertson&#x27;s pre-show hypnosis, before their first concert as the Band at San Francisco&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom in April 1969. As &quot;Northern Lights – Southern Cross&quot; had stalled at No. 26 in the autumn of 1975, many of the performances were confined to theaters and smaller arenas (including the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium and the Long Island Arena), culminating in an opening slot for the ascendant ZZ Top at the Nashville Fairgrounds in September. The quality of the shows was frequently contingent upon Manuel&#x27;s relative sobriety. Throughout the tour, he struggled with the high vocal registers of &quot;Tears of Rage,&quot; &quot;In a Station&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; but offered impassioned, raging versions of the prophetic &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot; and &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come).&quot;

The Band played its final show as its original configuration at Winterland on Thanksgiving Day of 1976. The concert was filmed in 35 mm by Robertson confidant and longtime Band fan Martin Scorsese for the documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Manuel sings &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot; as well as contributing piano and backing vocals. Initially the group intended to end only live performances as the Band, and each member was initially kept on a retainer of $2,500 per week under a new contract with Warner Brothers. However, by 1978, the group had drifted apart.

===Session work, attempted comeback and continued struggles with substance abuse===
Taking advantage of this new solace, Manuel moved to Garth Hudson&#x27;s ranch outside Malibu. He entered an alcohol and drug rehabilitation program, becoming clean and sober for the first time in years in August 1978. He also was eventually remarried to his longtime girlfriend, Arlie Litvak. Having initially become enamored of Manuel after hearing &quot;Lonesome Suzie,&quot; the Toronto-born, 21-year-old Litvak became acquainted with the singer on the 1974 tour and subsequently moved into the Moon house with Manuel in 1977. In 1980, he contributed electric piano and clavinet to Happy Traum&#x27;s &quot;Bright Morning Stars&quot; and background vocals to Hudson&#x27;s &quot;Music for Our Lady Queen of the Angels&quot;.

During this period, Danko and Manuel began to tour clubs as a semi-acoustic duo. These concerts would continue into the Band reunion era and often included fellow Woodstock habitué Paul Butterfield as a special guest. Along with Hudson, Manuel played on several instrumental cues composed by Robertson for the soundtrack of &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980). Manuel and Hudson also contributed to &quot;Between Trains,&quot; a new song by Robertson that appeared on the soundtrack of &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; (1983), and the original soundtrack of &quot;Kent State&quot;, a 1981 television film based on the Kent State shootings. Throughout the early 1980s, he sat in on little-publicized gigs in L.A.-area clubs with The Pencils, an ensemble that included vocalists/ multi-instrumentalists Marty Grebb and Terry Danko, founding Blues Image percussionist Joe Lala and former Beach Boys drummer Ricky Fataar. Along with Stephen Stills and Mike Finnigan, he contributed backing vocals to a 1983 album by the band that was left unreleased after Danko was in a debilitating car accident.

Although he continued to grapple with writer&#x27;s block, Manuel wrote a new song, &quot;Was That Any Way to Say Goodbye,&quot; with the younger Danko and Grebb. A year later, he contributed piano to Willie Nelson and Webb Pierce&#x27;s 1982 remake of &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot; (a country hit for the latter in 1955) and background vocals to &quot;Rivers of Tears&quot; on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Green Light&quot;.

The Band reformed in 1983 without Robertson, who permanently stopped touring after &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Instead, guitarist and Helm protege Jim Weider augmented the returning four members along with a variety of irregular additional musicians, including the Cate Brothers. Having reclaimed some of his vocal range lost in the years of drug abuse, Manuel performed old hits such as &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot;, &quot;Chest Fever&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; with new conviction alongside personal favorites such as Cindy Walker and Eddy Arnold&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me&quot; and James Griffin and Robb Royer&#x27;s &quot;She Knows.&quot;

By the time of the reunion, Danko, Helm and their families had moved back to the Woodstock area from Malibu. Manuel returned with his wife in the spring of 1984. In poor health and fearing that he had contracted AIDS from decades of promiscuity and drug abuse, he contemplated making a Robertson-produced solo album and resumed using cocaine, heroin, and alcohol. On one occasion, Manuel absconded with journalist and old friend Al Aronowitz&#x27;s record collection in a midnight burglary to fund his addictions. Following a detox stint at the behest of Albert Grossman, Manuel had several months of sobriety. He undertook a successful solo residency (centered around &quot;his favorite Ray Charles songs&quot; and &quot;Tin Pan Alley classics&quot;) at The Getaway, a club midway between Woodstock and nearby Saugerties, New York. Guests such as Danko and Weider frequently sat in. During this period, Manuel also co-wrote a new song, &quot;Breaking New Ground,&quot; with Gerry Goffin and Carole King. However, he ultimately &quot;fell off the wagon with a thud&quot; in the spring of 1985.

In addition to their other activities, Manuel and Danko toured throughout 1985 with &quot;The 20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds,&quot; a tribute group led by founding Byrds members Gene Clark and Michael Clarke that also included former Flying Burrito Brothers and Firefall member Rick Roberts, former Beach Boys guitarist Blondie Chaplin and 1968-1969 Byrds bassist John York. Several concert promoters began to shorten the band&#x27;s name to &quot;The Byrds&quot; in advertisements and promotional material. As the band continued to tour in 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to &quot;The Byrds&quot; permanently, eliciting displeasure from co-founders Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman. Although Michael Clarke continued working with a similar group, Clark heeded their complaints and folded the group.

Throughout this period, Manuel continued to participate in several projects in addition to his road work, including the recording of the Ethiopian famine relief charity single &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot; by the ad hoc Canadian supergroup Northern Lights. The song was eventually included on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album. Along with Hudson on keyboards, Manuel also contributed background vocals to Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers&#x27;s &quot;Best of Everything&quot; (co-produced by Robertson) on &quot;Southern Accents&quot;.

In a March 1985 interview with Ruth Albert Spencer of the &quot;Woodstock Times&quot;, Manuel expressed equivocation toward The Band&#x27;s professional direction at a time when the group was relegated to playing theaters and clubs as headliners and support slots in larger venues for onetime peers such as the Grateful Dead and Crosby, Stills and Nash: &quot;I sobered up and I pay a lot closer attention when I realize what we threw away. We didn&#x27;t really throw it away, we benched it and in just this last year and a half I&#x27;ve seen millions of dollars go by ... doors open but we haven&#x27;t taken advantage of it&quot;.

===Death===
On March 4, 1986, after a gig by The Band at the Cheek to Cheek Lounge in Winter Park, Florida (a suburb of Orlando, Florida), Manuel died by suicide. He had appeared to be in relatively good spirits at the concert but ominously &quot;thanked [Hudson] profusely for twenty-five years of good music and appreciation&quot; as the latter musician packed his keyboards and synthesizers to be shipped to the next venue after the show. Danko, who also struggled with substance abuse, confronted Manuel about his alcohol use after the show. The Band eventually returned to the Quality Inn, and Manuel talked with Helm about music, people, and film in Helm&#x27;s room. According to Helm, at around 2:30 in the morning, Manuel said he needed to get something from his room. Upon returning to his room, he woke his wife, Arlie, who observed that Manuel &quot;was all pissed off about something&quot;; Manuel claimed that his frustration stemmed from the quality of the piano at the venue. When Arlie enjoined him to come to bed, he joined her with his clothes on. After she resumed sleeping, it is believed that he finished one last bottle of Grand Marnier before hanging himself in the bathroom sometime before 3:30. She discovered her husband&#x27;s body along with the depleted bottle of liqueur and a small amount of cocaine the following morning. He was buried a week later at the Avondale Cemetery in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario. At his memorial service in Woodstock, Danko sang one of Manuel&#x27;s most famous covers, Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; accompanied by the church&#x27;s pipe organ and the other attendees.

At the end of March, Danko declared, &quot;I can&#x27;t believe in a million years that he meant for that to happen. There was just no sign ... I have to think this was just a goddamned silly accident.&quot; A blood toxicology report indicated that Manuel was drunk and had ingested cocaine within 12 to 24 hours of his death.

In 2004, the city of Stratford honored Manuel with a sidewalk star in the busy tourist section of Ontario Street. There is also a memorial bench seated next to the Avon River dedicated in his honor.
==Posthumous recognition==
Although Manuel died before The Band recorded their final three albums, two songs featuring him on lead vocals, recorded in the 1980s, were included on the first two of these albums: &quot;Country Boy,&quot; on &quot;Jericho&quot; (1993), and &quot;She Knows,&quot; on &quot;High on the Hog&quot; (1996).

In 1994, Manuel was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Band. In 2015, he was inducted into the New York Blues Hall of Fame.

In 2002, the Japanese label Dreamsville Records released &quot;Whispering Pines: Live at the Getaway&quot;, which contains selections from a solo performance by Manuel at The Getaway in October 1985.

Robbie Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; (1987), Ronnie Hawkins&#x27;s &quot;Days Gone By&quot; (1995) and The Band&#x27;s &quot;Too Soon Gone&quot; (1993) are all tributes to Manuel.

Eric Clapton&#x27;s 1986 album, &quot;August&quot;, features his tribute to Manuel, entitled &quot;Holy Mother.&quot; The San Francisco–area group The Call, who had collaborated with Hudson and Robertson, dedicated the video for their 1986 single &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot; to Manuel. Counting Crows recorded the song &quot;If I Could Give All My Love (Richard Manuel Is Dead),&quot; released on their 2002 album &quot;Hard Candy&quot;. The Drive-By Truckers&#x27; song &quot;Danko/Manuel&quot; was released on their album &quot;The Dirty South&quot; in 2004.

Head of Femur included &quot;Song for Richard Manuel&quot; on their 2005 release, &quot;Hysterical Stars&quot;. In 2008, the Michigan roots quartet Steppin&#x27; In It released the album &quot;Simple Tunes for Troubled Times&quot;, which contains the song &quot;The Ghost of Richard Manuel,&quot; while Isaac Gillespie&#x27;s album &quot;1971&quot; features &quot;Richard Manuel the Pacifier.&quot; Ray Lamontagne referred to the singer during his performance on the BBC program &quot;Songwriter&#x27;s Circle&quot;. In 2012 Black Prairie released &quot;A Tear in the Eye Is a Wound in the Heart&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Richard Manuel&quot;. Steppin&#x27; In It&#x27;s 2008 album, &quot;Simple Tunes For Troubled Times&quot; includes the song &quot;The Ghost of Richard Manuel.&quot; In a 2016 interview on his &quot;WTF&quot; podcast, Marc Maron and Roger Waters discussed their mutual love for The Band, with Waters ruminating on the beauty of Manuel&#x27;s voice.

<text>The Bulgarian Cyrillic alphabet () is used to write the Bulgarian language.
The Cyrillic alphabet was originally developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th – 10th century AD at the Preslav Literary School.

It has been used in Bulgaria (with modifications and exclusion of certain archaic letters via spelling reforms) continuously since then, superseding the previously used Glagolitic alphabet, which was also invented and used there before the Cyrillic script overtook its use as a written script for the Bulgarian language. The Cyrillic alphabet was used in the then much bigger territory of Bulgaria (including most of today&#x27;s Serbia), North Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania, Northern Greece (Macedonia region), Romania and Moldova, officially from 893. It was also transferred from Bulgaria and adopted by the East Slavic languages in Kievan Rus&#x27; and evolved into the Belarusian, Russian and Ukrainian alphabets and the alphabets of many other Slavic (and later non-Slavic) languages. Later, some Slavs modified it and added/excluded letters from it to better suit the needs of their own language varieties.

==History==
In the 9th century, the Bulgarian Empire introduced the Glagolitic alphabet, devised by Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. The Glagolitic alphabet was gradually superseded in later centuries by the Cyrillic script, developed around the Preslav Literary School, Bulgaria at the end of the 9th century.

Several Cyrillic alphabets with 28 to 44 letters were used in the early and middle 19th century during the efforts on the codification of Modern Bulgarian until an alphabet with 32 letters, proposed by Marin Drinov, gained prominence in the 1870s: it was used until the orthographic reform of 1945, when the letters yat (uppercase , lowercase ) and yus (uppercase , lowercase ) were removed from its alphabet, reducing the number of letters to 30. Yat was also known as &quot;double e&quot; (), and yus was also known as &quot;big nasal sign&quot; (), crossed yer (), and &quot;wide yer&quot; ().

Although Bulgarian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, some letter shapes in Bulgaria were made to look more &#x27;Latin&#x27; in the 20th century (see the pictures on the right in the article), however they are rarely used today and most typefaces do not support them.

With the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union on 1 January 2007, the Cyrillic script became the third official script of the European Union, following the Latin and Greek scripts.

==List==

===Overview===

===Detailed table===
The following table gives the letters of the Bulgarian alphabet, along with the values for the sound of each letter. The listed transliteration in the Official transliteration column (known as the Streamlined System) is official in Bulgaria and is listed in the Official orthographic dictionary (2012). For other transliteration standards see Romanization of Bulgarian.


Most letters in the Bulgarian alphabet stand for just one specific sound. Five letters stand for sounds written in English with two or more letters. These letters are (ch), (sh), (sht), (yu), and (ya). Two additional sounds are written with two letters: these are () and (). The letter marks the softening (palatalization) of any consonant (except , , and ) before the letter , while and after consonants mark the palatalization of the preceding consonant in addition to representing the vowels and .

The names of most letters are simple representations of their phonetic values, with consonants being followed by – thus the alphabet goes: – – , etc. However, the name of the letter is &quot;i-kratko&quot; (&quot;short i&quot;), the name of is &quot;er-golyam&quot; (&quot;large yer&quot;), and the name of is &quot;er-malak&quot; (&quot;small yer&quot;). People often refer to simply as .

The Bulgarian alphabet features:
* The Bulgarian names for the consonants are , , etc. instead of , , etc.
* Е represents and is called &quot;е&quot; .
* The sounds () and () are represented by дж and дз respectively.
* Short I (Й, й) represents .
* Щ represents () and is called &quot;щъ&quot; ().
* Ъ represents the vowel , and is called &quot;ер голям&quot; (&#x27;big er&#x27;). In spelling however, Ъ is referred to as where its official label &quot;ер голям&quot; (used only to refer to Ъ in the alphabet) may cause some confusion. The vowel Ъ is sometimes approximated to the (schwa) sound found in many languages for easier comprehension of its Bulgarian pronunciation for foreigners, but it is actually a back vowel, not a central vowel.
* Ь is used on rare occasions (only after a consonant [and] before the vowel &quot;о&quot;), such as in the words &#x27;каньон&#x27; (canyon), &#x27;шофьор&#x27; (driver), etc. It is called &quot;ер малък&quot; (&#x27;small er&#x27;).

The grave accent is used to distinguish the pronoun &#x27;her&#x27; from the conjunction &#x27;and&#x27;. Ѝ is not considered a separate letter but rather a special form of .

==Writing==

Bulgarian is usually described as having a phonemic orthography, meaning that words are spelt the way they are pronounced. This is largely true, but there are exceptions. Three of the most cited examples are:
* The sounds and , which appear only in unstressed syllables, are written with two different letters each – &quot; or &quot;, and &quot; or &quot; respectively.
* The vowel in stressed verb endings , , and and the stressed short definite articles and is pronounced . Thus (&quot;I read&quot;) is pronounced , and (&quot;the man&quot;) is pronounced .
* Voiced consonants are pronounced unvoiced when at the end of a word or when preceding an unvoiced consonant – e.g. (&quot;second&quot;) is pronounced , and (&quot;city&quot;) is pronounced . Similarly, unvoiced consonants are pronounced voiced when preceding a voiced consonant – e.g. (&quot;building&quot;) is . (The voiced consonant &quot;&quot; is an exception – it does not cause the preceding unvoiced consonant to become voiced – (wedding) is .)

===Modern developments===
Since the time of Bulgaria&#x27;s liberation in the late 19th century, the Bulgarian language has taken on a large number of words from Western European languages. All of these are transcribed phonetically into Cyrillic, e.g.:
* French – e.g. ( – sidewalk), ( – corkscrew), (from – ground floor)
* German – e.g. ( – bandage), ( – digger), ( – drill)
Notable is the transliteration of many English names through German, e.g.:
* Washington → (), Scotland → ()

In the years since the end of communism and the rise of technology, the tendency for borrowing has shifted mainly to English, where much computer-related terminology has entered and been inflected accordingly – again, in a wholly phonetic way. Examples include:
* () – I click on the file
* () – you download it onto the desktop
* () – we chat on the net
The computer-related neologisms are often used interchangeably with traditional Bulgarian words, e.g. &#x27;download&#x27; and &#x27;upload&#x27; can be simply and ( and – &#x27;to bring down&#x27; and &#x27;to put up&#x27;).

===Use of Roman script in Bulgarian===

The insertion of English words directly into a Cyrillic Bulgarian sentence, while frowned upon, has been increasingly used in the media. This is done for several reasons, including –
* To shorten what would otherwise be a longer word or phrase –
:: (instead of - American)
:: &quot;The Yanks oppose more US troops in Afghanistan&quot;
* To avoid the need to transcribe to Cyrillic or translate to Bulgarian well known abbreviations:
:: (instead of, for example, )
:: &quot;We have not seen the end of SOPA, PIPA and ACTA&quot;

Brand names are also often not transcribed: WikiLeaks, YouTube, Skype – as opposed to , , . However, this is not always the case, as in the headline &quot;&quot; (official transliteration: &quot;Feysbuk vs. Gugal&quot;). Note the inconsistency here – despite the insistence on Cyrillic, the &quot;vs.&quot; has been retained in Roman script.

The 2012 &quot;Official Orthographic Dictionary of the Bulgarian Language&quot; by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences permits widely known proper names to remain in their original alphabet. Example sentences are given, all containing names of American IT companies: Yahoo, Microsoft, YouTube, PayPal, Facebook.

<text>A slipcover (also called loose cover) is a fitted protective cover that may be slipped off and onto a piece of upholstered furniture. Slipcovers are usually made of cloth. Slipcovers slip on and off; they come fresh and may be removed for seasonal change, cleaning, moving, or storage.

Slipcovers are sometimes defined as &quot;clothing for furniture.&quot; Indeed, they are tailored just as clothing and fitted loosely or snugly to the owner&#x27;s or tailor&#x27;s taste. Some order furniture upholstered in plain muslin, intending to use slipcovers only.

==History==

In the days before home air conditioning was available, it was common to put slipcovers on upholstered furniture in the hot months of the year to protect the upholstery fabric from sweat. Slipcover tailors offered clear vinyl or plastic slipcovers. These clear plastic slipcovers were available in large department stores such as Jordan Marsh or custom-made by artisans.

In some cities in the northeast U.S., slipcover tailors were sometimes given the nickname &quot;summertime millionaires&quot; as their busy season was in the spring and summer. Custom slipcovering was done then, each one cut and sewn to order.

In the 1960s, technology and production techniques made it possible to manufacture furniture that could be sold at or below the price of a custom-made slipcover, and the practice of custom slipcovering for a time declined.

In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in custom slipcovering driven by the interior design industry and the popularity of the very casual shabby chic design style.

==Technology and materials==
As this new &quot;looser&quot; fitting style of slipcovers does not always require custom tailoring, some furniture manufacturers are beginning to offer &quot;ready-made&quot; slipcovers.

Ready-made, generic fit slipcovers are available at many mainstream retailers that sell linens (sheets). With these generic fit slipcovers, some effort is required to maintain a tailored look of a slipcover applied to a couch or loveseat, as usage of the furniture will pull at the edges of the slipcover, which are tucked under the cushions, all of one piece. Manufacturers often provide foam sticks to tuck slipcovers into the sides and creases of couches. Design and materials used have also improved, allowing different kinds of generic slipcovers to be sold to consumers, including elastic covers that fit nearly perfectly around a couch, loosely fitted covers that are placed over key areas of a couch covers with skirts, and those made with material designed to withstand use from pets.

Custom-fitted slipcovers can resemble upholstery in their fit. They are fabricated to the exact shape of the furniture, and the cushions are slipcovered separately from the frame. 

Slipcover material is usually a stretchable fabric, a polyester blend (polyester, cotton, and elastane). Bi-elastic fabric can be stretched both vertically and horizontally for a perfect fit. Strings or ribbons are used to keep the cover in place.

Slipcover fabrication is a specialty offered by slipcover makers. Some upholsterers and drapery workrooms also make slipcovers.

==Industry==
Slipcovering skills are revived every generation by new groups that tend to change in characteristics over decades. Slipcover arts were once a close-guarded secret.

One constant is the cottage industry aspect: slipcovers are easily made by small groups in the home or home-based businesses. Historically, in a lower-wage occupation with a division of labor based on gender, slipcover sewers were often not taught or expected to cut.

Today, the trend is for more educated populations, more women, to choose this cottage industry product as a profession. Each one-person business tends to follow all the steps of marketing and manufacturing.

These one-person businesses may jointly market their services. The World Wide Web has contributed to the survival of slipcovering. Slipcover artists have found one another through networks or professional listings. Slipcover knowledge has lately been pooled and shared through this source.

However, the production of clear vinyl slipcovers is not as great as it used to be. Modern upholstery fabrics are more durable; they are both more resistant to dirt and easier to clean. Many upholstery fabrics can be washed in cold water without harm. Although pleasing to look at, transparent vinyl slipcovers are often very uncomfortable to sit on, particularly on hot summer days. These days, it is almost impossible to get clear vinyl slipcovers without customizing them.

<doc id="664496" wikidata="Q1218897" url="?curid=664496" title="The Last Seduction">
<text>The Last Seduction is a 1994 American neo-noir erotic thriller film directed by John Dahl, featuring Linda Fiorentino, Peter Berg, and Bill Pullman. It was produced by ITC Entertainment and distributed by October Films. 

Fiorentino&#x27;s performance garnered acclaim and generated talk of an Academy Award nomination, but she was deemed ineligible because the film was shown on HBO before its theatrical release. October Films and ITC Entertainment sued the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences but were unable to make Fiorentino eligible for a nomination.

&quot;The Last Seduction&quot; has gained a cult following over time, and its main character, Bridget Gregory, has been recognized as one of the most iconic femme fatales. In 2019, the British Film Institute included the movie, along with &quot;Gone Girl&quot; and &quot;Death Becomes Her,&quot; in a program dedicated to exploring &quot;wickedly compelling female characters on screen.&quot; The film was also featured in The Criterion Channel&#x27;s Neonoir series in July 2021. &quot;The Last Seduction II&quot; was released in 1999. It featured none of the original cast and starred Joan Severance as Bridget Gregory.

==Plot==
Bridget Gregory works as a telemarketing manager in New York City. Her husband, Clay, a physician in debt to a loan shark, sells pharmaceutical cocaine to drug dealers for $700,000. At home, Clay slaps Bridget after she insults him. She flees their apartment with the money, headed to Chicago.

Bridget stops in Beston, a small town near Buffalo. She has sex with Mike Swale, a local man back from a whirlwind marriage in Buffalo, which he refuses to talk about. Bridget changes her name to Wendy Kroy, a reversal of &quot;New York&quot;, and takes a job at the insurance company where Mike works. They begin a relationship, but Bridget refuses to tell Mike about her past.

When Mike tells her how to tell if a man is cheating on his wife by reading his credit reports, Bridget devises a plan based on selling murders to cheated wives. When Mike objects, they argue and he leaves. A private detective hired by Clay, Harlan, holds Bridget at gunpoint in her car. Bridget tricks him into removing his seatbelt, then purposely crashes her car, killing him. As Harlan was black, she takes advantage of local racism to persuade the police to close the case without investigation.

Bridget lies to Mike that she has traveled to Florida to kill Lance Collier, an abusive husband. Instead, she goes to Buffalo to meet Mike&#x27;s ex-wife, Trish, who is transgender. Upon returning, Bridget shows Mike the money she stole from Clay, claiming it is her cut of the life insurance payout from the Florida job. She tells Mike they can start a life together with the money, but insists he must murder a tax lawyer in New York who is cheating old ladies out of their homes. When he refuses, Bridget forges a letter from Trish saying she is moving to Beston. Desperate to avoid Trish, Mike accepts the job.

Bridget swaps the name on Clay&#x27;s door with the name of the attorney Mike believes he has been sent to kill. Mike enters the apartment and handcuffs Clay. Clay realizes what is happening when Mike mentions Bridget&#x27;s alias and shows Mike a photo of himself and Bridget together. They form a plan to double-cross her. When Bridget arrives, Clay tries to make amends with her, but she empties a pepper spray bottle down his throat, killing him. She tells a stunned Mike to rape her. When he refuses, she tells him she knows about Trish and goads him with homophobic slurs. While Mike has rough sex with her, she dials 911 and allows them to listen, incriminating Mike. He is jailed for rape and murder, while Bridget escapes with Clay&#x27;s money and multi-million-dollar life insurance payout. In a limousine, she burns the apartment label, the only evidence linking her to Clay&#x27;s death.

==Production==
Screenwriter Steve Barancik said he believed the film was originally pitched to ITC Entertainment as a &quot;standard Skinemax&quot; low-budget movie, even though the filmmakers had &quot;an under-the-radar intention to make a good movie.&quot; Linda Fiorentino said of accepting the role, &quot;After I read that script, I was in Arizona and I got in a car and drove six hours to get to the meeting because I had never read anything so unique in terms of a female character. And I walked in the meeting with John Dahl, the director, and I said, &#x27;John, you are not allowed to hire anyone but me for this film.&#x27; And I wasn&#x27;t kidding.&quot;

ITC Entertainment executives were upset with a scene in which Fiorentino is dressed as a cheerleader and wears suspenders over her breasts. Barancik recalled, &quot;Apparently, a guy from the company who was monitoring things and watching the dailies saw the suspenders over Linda&#x27;s nipples and shouted out, &#x27;Are we making an art movie?!&#x27; He shut down production and called the principals of the movie on the carpet, and they all had to pledge that they had no artistic pretensions.&quot; The scene was cut, and the sexual role-playing theme was lost.

Peter Berg said it was Fiorentino&#x27;s idea to shoot the chain-link-fence sex scene in that way. &quot;She said, &#x27;John, get a camera,&#x27; and she climbed up on me against that fence and told John Dahl to shoot it, and that was the scene. She thought of it, she conceived it, she executed it. It was awesome.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;The Last Seduction&quot; received critical acclaim. It holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 51 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Like &quot;Body Heat&quot;, &quot;The Last Seduction&quot; updates film noir techniques for a modern era, imbuing this erotic film with &#x27;90s snark.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 85 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, highlighting Fiorentino&#x27;s ability to project her character with dry humor and a freedom from Hollywood conventions typically surrounding a female antagonist. Ebert later ranked the film fifth on his year-end list of 1994&#x27;s best movies. He wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;:

<doc id="664497" wikidata="Q53875" url="?curid=664497" title="Parallel (geometry)">
<text>In geometry, parallel lines are coplanar infinite straight lines that do not intersect at any point. Parallel planes are planes in the same three-dimensional space that never meet. &quot;Parallel curves&quot; are curves that do not touch each other or intersect and keep a fixed minimum distance. In three-dimensional Euclidean space, a line and a plane that do not share a point are also said to be parallel. However, two noncoplanar lines are called &quot;skew lines&quot;. Line segments and Euclidean vectors are parallel if they have the same direction or opposite direction (not necessarily the same length).

Parallel lines are the subject of Euclid&#x27;s parallel postulate. Parallelism is primarily a property of affine geometries and Euclidean geometry is a special instance of this type of geometry.
In some other geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, lines can have analogous properties that are referred to as parallelism.

== Symbol ==
The parallel symbol is formula_1. For example, formula_2 indicates that line &quot;AB&quot; is parallel to line &quot;CD&quot;.

In the Unicode character set, the &quot;parallel&quot; and &quot;not parallel&quot; signs have codepoints U+2225 (∥) and U+2226 (∦), respectively. In addition, U+22D5 (⋕) represents the relation &quot;equal and parallel to&quot;.

== Euclidean parallelism==

===Two lines in a plane===

====Conditions for parallelism====

Given parallel straight lines &quot;l&quot; and &quot;m&quot; in Euclidean space, the following properties are equivalent:

#Every point on line &quot;m&quot; is located at exactly the same (minimum) distance from line &quot;l&quot; (&quot;equidistant lines&quot;).
#Line &quot;m&quot; is in the same plane as line &quot;l&quot; but does not intersect &quot;l&quot; (recall that lines extend to infinity in either direction).
#When lines &quot;m&quot; and &quot;l&quot; are both intersected by a third straight line (a transversal) in the same plane, the corresponding angles of intersection with the transversal are congruent.

Since these are equivalent properties, any one of them could be taken as the definition of parallel lines in Euclidean space, but the first and third properties involve measurement, and so, are &quot;more complicated&quot; than the second. Thus, the second property is the one usually chosen as the defining property of parallel lines in Euclidean geometry. The other properties are then consequences of Euclid&#x27;s Parallel Postulate.

====History====
The definition of parallel lines as a pair of straight lines in a plane which do not meet appears as Definition 23 in Book I of Euclid&#x27;s Elements. Alternative definitions were discussed by other Greeks, often as part of an attempt to prove the parallel postulate. Proclus attributes a definition of parallel lines as equidistant lines to Posidonius and quotes Geminus in a similar vein. Simplicius also mentions Posidonius&#x27; definition as well as its modification by the philosopher Aganis.

At the end of the nineteenth century, in England, Euclid&#x27;s Elements was still the standard textbook in secondary schools. The traditional treatment of geometry was being pressured to change by the new developments in projective geometry and non-Euclidean geometry, so several new textbooks for the teaching of geometry were written at this time. A major difference between these reform texts, both between themselves and between them and Euclid, is the treatment of parallel lines. These reform texts were not without their critics and one of them, Charles Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll), wrote a play, &quot;Euclid and His Modern Rivals&quot;, in which these texts are lambasted.

One of the early reform textbooks was James Maurice Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Elementary Geometry&quot; of 1868. Wilson based his definition of parallel lines on the primitive notion of &quot;direction&quot;. According to Wilhelm Killing the idea may be traced back to Leibniz. Wilson, without defining direction since it is a primitive, uses the term in other definitions such as his sixth definition, &quot;Two straight lines that meet one another have different directions, and the difference of their directions is the &quot;angle&quot; between them.&quot; In definition 15 he introduces parallel lines in this way; &quot;Straight lines which have the &quot;same direction&quot;, but are not parts of the same straight line, are called &quot;parallel lines&quot;.&quot; Augustus De Morgan reviewed this text and declared it a failure, primarily on the basis of this definition and the way Wilson used it to prove things about parallel lines. Dodgson also devotes a large section of his play (Act II, Scene VI § 1) to denouncing Wilson&#x27;s treatment of parallels. Wilson edited this concept out of the third and higher editions of his text.

Other properties, proposed by other reformers, used as replacements for the definition of parallel lines, did not fare much better. The main difficulty, as pointed out by Dodgson, was that to use them in this way required additional axioms to be added to the system. The equidistant line definition of Posidonius, expounded by Francis Cuthbertson in his 1874 text &quot;Euclidean Geometry&quot; suffers from the problem that the points that are found at a fixed given distance on one side of a straight line must be shown to form a straight line. This can not be proved and must be assumed to be true. The corresponding angles formed by a transversal property, used by W. D. Cooley in his 1860 text, &quot;The Elements of Geometry, simplified and explained&quot; requires a proof of the fact that if one transversal meets a pair of lines in congruent corresponding angles then all transversals must do so. Again, a new axiom is needed to justify this statement.

==== Construction ====
The three properties above lead to three different methods of construction of parallel lines.

==== Distance between two parallel lines ====
Because parallel lines in a Euclidean plane are equidistant there is a unique distance between the two parallel lines. Given the equations of two non-vertical, non-horizontal parallel lines,
:formula_3
:formula_4
the distance between the two lines can be found by locating two points (one on each line) that lie on a common perpendicular to the parallel lines and calculating the distance between them. Since the lines have slope &quot;m&quot;, a common perpendicular would have slope −1/&quot;m&quot; and we can take the line with equation &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;x&quot;/&quot;m&quot; as a common perpendicular. Solve the linear systems
:formula_5
and
:formula_6
to get the coordinates of the points. The solutions to the linear systems are the points
:formula_7
and
:formula_8
These formulas still give the correct point coordinates even if the parallel lines are horizontal (i.e., &quot;m&quot; = 0). The distance between the points is
:formula_9
which reduces to
:formula_10

When the lines are given by the general form of the equation of a line (horizontal and vertical lines are included):
:formula_11
:formula_12
their distance can be expressed as
:formula_13

===Two lines in three-dimensional space===
Two lines in the same three-dimensional space that do not intersect need not be parallel. Only if they are in a common plane are they called parallel; otherwise they are called skew lines.

Two distinct lines &quot;l&quot; and &quot;m&quot; in three-dimensional space are parallel if and only if the distance from a point &quot;P&quot; on line &quot;m&quot; to the nearest point on line &quot;l&quot; is independent of the location of &quot;P&quot; on line &quot;m&quot;. This never holds for skew lines.

===A line and a plane===
A line &quot;m&quot; and a plane &quot;q&quot; in three-dimensional space, the line not lying in that plane, are parallel if and only if they do not intersect.

Equivalently, they are parallel if and only if the distance from a point &quot;P&quot; on line &quot;m&quot; to the nearest point in plane &quot;q&quot; is independent of the location of &quot;P&quot; on line &quot;m&quot;.

===Two planes===
Similar to the fact that parallel lines must be located in the same plane, parallel planes must be situated in the same three-dimensional space and contain no point in common.

Two distinct planes &quot;q&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are parallel if and only if the distance from a point &quot;P&quot; in plane &quot;q&quot; to the nearest point in plane &quot;r&quot; is independent of the location of &quot;P&quot; in plane &quot;q&quot;. This will never hold if the two planes are not in the same three-dimensional space.

== In non-Euclidean geometry ==

In non-Euclidean geometry, the concept of a straight line is replaced by the more general concept of a geodesic, a curve which is locally straight with respect to the metric (definition of distance) on a Riemannian manifold, a surface (or higher-dimensional space) which may itself be curved. In general relativity, particles not under the influence of external forces follow geodesics in spacetime, a four-dimensional manifold with 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension.

In non-Euclidean geometry (elliptic or hyperbolic geometry) the three Euclidean properties mentioned above are not equivalent and only the second one (Line m is in the same plane as line l but does not intersect l) is useful in non-Euclidean geometries, since it involves no measurements. In general geometry the three properties above give three different types of curves, equidistant curves, parallel geodesics and geodesics sharing a common perpendicular, respectively.

=== Hyperbolic geometry ===

While in Euclidean geometry two geodesics can either intersect or be parallel, in hyperbolic geometry, there are three possibilities. Two geodesics belonging to the same plane can either be:

# intersecting, if they intersect in a common point in the plane,
# parallel, if they do not intersect in the plane, but converge to a common limit point at infinity (ideal point), or
# ultra parallel, if they do not have a common limit point at infinity.

In the literature &quot;ultra parallel&quot; geodesics are often called &quot;non-intersecting&quot;. &quot;Geodesics intersecting at infinity&quot; are called &quot;limiting parallel&quot;.

As in the illustration through a point &quot;a&quot; not on line &quot;l&quot; there are two limiting parallel lines, one for each direction ideal point of line l. They separate the lines intersecting line l and those that are ultra parallel to line &quot;l&quot;.

Ultra parallel lines have single common perpendicular (ultraparallel theorem), and diverge on both sides of this common perpendicular.

=== Spherical or elliptic geometry ===


In spherical geometry, all geodesics are great circles. Great circles divide the sphere in two equal hemispheres and all great circles intersect each other. Thus, there are no parallel geodesics to a given geodesic, as all geodesics intersect. Equidistant curves on the sphere are called parallels of latitude analogous to the latitude lines on a globe. Parallels of latitude can be generated by the intersection of the sphere with a plane parallel to a plane through the center of the sphere.
==Reflexive variant==
If &quot;l, m, n&quot; are three distinct lines, then formula_14

In this case, parallelism is a transitive relation. However, in case &quot;l&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, the superimposed lines are &quot;not&quot; considered parallel in Euclidean geometry. The binary relation between parallel lines is evidently a symmetric relation. According to Euclid&#x27;s tenets, parallelism is &quot;not&quot; a reflexive relation and thus &quot;fails&quot; to be an equivalence relation. Nevertheless, in affine geometry a pencil of parallel lines is taken as an equivalence class in the set of lines where parallelism is an equivalence relation.

To this end, Emil Artin (1957) adopted a definition of parallelism where two lines are parallel if they have all or none of their points in common.
Then a line &quot;is&quot; parallel to itself so that the reflexive and transitive properties belong to this type of parallelism, creating an equivalence relation on the set of lines. In the study of incidence geometry, this variant of parallelism is used in the affine plane.

<text>The Colorado State Senate is the upper house of the Colorado General Assembly, the state legislature of the US state of Colorado. It is composed of 35 members elected from single-member districts, with each district having a population of about 123,000 as of the 2000 census. Senators are elected to four-year terms, and are limited to two consecutive terms in office. Senators who are term-limited become eligible to run again after a one-term (four year) respite.

The Colorado Senate convenes at the State Capitol in Denver.

==History==
The first meeting of the Colorado General Assembly took place from November 1, 1876, through March 20, 1877. Lafayette Head was the first state senate president.

The lieutenant governor served as Senate President until 1974 when Article V, Section 10 of the state constitution was amended, granting the Colorado Senate the right to elect one of its own members as President. Fred Anderson was the first state senate president elected after the amendment. Ruth Stockton was the first woman to become Senate&#x27;s president pro tempore, serving from 1979 to 1980.

==Terms and qualifications==
The Colorado Senate has 35 members elected to staggered four-year terms. Half the chamber is elected in the same year as gubernatorial elections, with the other half elected in the same year as presidential elections.

State senators are term-limited to two consecutive terms, equivalent to eight years. Term-limited former members can run again after a four-year break. Vacancies in legislative offices are generally filled by political party vacancy committees, rather than special elections. Vacancy appointees who fill the first half of a state senator&#x27;s term must stand for election at the next even year November election for the remainder of the state senate term for the seat to which the state senator was appointed.

==Procedure and powers==
With the notable exceptions listed below, the Colorado Senate operates in a manner quite similar to the United States Senate.

Regular sessions are held annually and begin no later than the second Wednesday in January. Regular sessions last no more than 120 days. Special sessions may be called at any time by the governor of Colorado or upon written request of two-thirds of the members of each house, but are infrequent. Some committees of the General Assembly work between sessions and have limited power to take action without General Assembly approval between legislative sessions.

Joint procedural rules of the two chambers require most legislation to be introduced very early in the legislative session each year, and to meet strict deadlines for completion of each step of the legislative process. Joint procedural rules also limit each legislator to introducing five bills per year, subject to certain exceptions for non-binding resolutions, uniform acts, interim committee bills and appropriations bills. Most members of the General Assembly decide which bills they will introduce during the legislative session (or most of them) prior to its commencement, limiting the ability of members to introduce new bills at constituent request once the legislative session has begun.

Most bills adopted by the General Assembly include a &quot;safety clause&quot; (i.e. a legislative declaration that the bill concerns an urgent matter) and take effect on July 1 following the legislative session unless otherwise provided. Some bills are enacted without a &quot;safety clause&quot; which makes it possible to petition to subject those bills to a referendum before they take effect, and have an effective date in August following the legislative session unless otherwise provided.

Colorado&#x27;s legislature does not have an analog to the filibuster in the United States Senate requiring a supermajority for approval of any matter. The state lieutenant governor does not have the power to preside or break tie votes in either house of the General Assembly. New executive branch rules are reviewed annually by the legislature and the legislature routinely invalidates some of them each year.

The General Assembly does not have a role in the appointment or retention of state judges, although it must authorize the creation of each judgeship.

Many state agencies and programs are subject to &quot;sunset review&quot; and are automatically abolished if the General Assembly does not reauthorize them.

In 1885, the Colorado Senate appointed its first chaplain, Methodist circuit riding missionary, &quot;Father&quot; John Lewis Dyer.

===The state budget process===
The governor submits a proposed budget to the Joint Budget Committee each year in advance of the year&#x27;s legislative session. Colorado&#x27;s fiscal year is from July 1 to June 30.

Bills introduced in the General Assembly are evaluated by the non-partisan state legislative services body for their fiscal impact and must be provided for in appropriations legislation if there is a fiscal impact.

A state budget, called the &quot;LONG Bill&quot; (Legislation on Operations and Normal Governance) is prepared each year by the Joint Budget Committee of the General Assembly. The House and the Senate alternate the job of introducing the long bill and making a first committee review of it. Colorado&#x27;s state legislature is required to obtain voter approval in order to incur significant debt, to raise taxes, or to increase state constitutional spending limitations. It is also required to comply with a state constitutional spending mandate for K-12 education. The governor has line item veto power over appropriations.

==Current makeup==
Based on the 2010 census, each state senator represents 143,691 constituents. The 2024 Colorado Elections resulted in the Democratic Party maintaining a majority of seats in the senate. Democrats currently hold a majority in the Senate in the 75th General Assembly: 23 Democrats and 12 Republicans.

At the 2024 elections 18 senate seats came up for re-election. As a result the composition of the State Senate at the beginning of the 75th General Assembly is 23 Democrats and 12 Republicans.

With the Democratic majority, James Coleman serves as President of the Senate and Robert Rodriguez serves as the Majority Leader.

<doc id="664510" wikidata="Q7557987" url="?curid=664510" title="Solidarity Forever">
<text>&quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;, written by Ralph Chaplin in 1915, is a popular trade union anthem promoting the use of solidarity amongst workers through unions. It is sung to the tune of &quot;John Brown&#x27;s Body&quot; and &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;. Although it was written as a song for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), other union movements, such as the AFL–CIO, have adopted the song as their own. The song has been performed by musicians such as Utah Phillips, Pete Seeger, and John Darnielle. It was redone by Emcee Lynx and The Nightwatchman. It is still commonly sung at union meetings and rallies in the United States, Australia and Canada, and has also been sung at conferences of the Australian Labor Party and the Canadian New Democratic Party. This may have also inspired the hymn of the consumer cooperative movement, &quot;The Battle Hymn of Cooperation&quot;, which is sung to the same tune.

It has been translated into several other languages, including French, German, Polish, Spanish, Swahili and Yiddish.

==Lyrics==
==Composition==
Ralph Chaplin began writing &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot; in 1913, while he was working as a journalist covering the Paint Creek–Cabin Creek strike of 1912 in Kanawha County, West Virginia, having been inspired by the resolve and high spirits of the striking miners and their families who had endured the violent strike (which killed around 50 people on both sides) and had been living for a year in tents. He completed the song on January 15, 1915, in Chicago, on the date of a hunger demonstration. Chaplin was a dedicated Wobbly, a writer at the time for &quot;Solidarity&quot;, the official IWW publication in the eastern United States, and a cartoonist for the organization. He shared the analysis of the IWW, embodied in its famed &quot;Preamble&quot;, printed inside the front cover of every &quot;Little Red Songbook&quot;.

The Preamble begins with a classic statement of a two-class analysis of capitalism: &quot;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common.&quot; The class struggle will continue until the victory of the working class: &quot;Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the earth and the machinery of production, and abolish the wage system.&quot; The Preamble denounces trade unions as incapable of coping with the power of the employing class. By negotiating contracts, the Preamble states, trade unions mislead workers by giving the impression that workers have interests in common with employers.

The Preamble calls for workers to build an organization of all &quot;members in any one industry, or in all industries&quot;. Although that sounds a lot like the industrial unionism developed by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the IWW would oppose John L. Lewis&#x27; campaign to split from the American Federation of Labor and organize industrial unions in the 1930s. The Preamble explains, &quot;Instead of the conservative motto, &#x27;A fair day&#x27;s wage for a fair day&#x27;s work,&#x27; we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, &#x27;Abolition of the wage system.&#x27; The IWW embraced syndicalism, and opposed participation in electoral politics: &quot;by organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old&quot;.

The outlook of the Preamble is embodied in &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot;, which enunciates several elements of the IWW&#x27;s analysis. The third stanza (&quot;It is we who plowed the prairies&quot;) asserts the primacy of the role of workers in creating value. This is echoed in stanzas four and five, which provide ethical justification for the workers&#x27; claim to &quot;all the world.&quot; The second stanza (&quot;Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite&quot;) assumes the two antagonistic classes described in the Preamble. The first and fifth stanzas provide the strategy for labor: union solidarity. And the sixth stanza projects the outcome, a new world brought to birth &quot;from the ashes of the old&quot;.

Chaplin was not pleased with the widespread popularity of &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot; in the labor movement. Late in his life, after he had become a voice opposing (State) Communists in the labor movement, Chaplin wrote an article, &quot;Why I wrote Solidarity Forever&quot;, in which he denounced the &quot;not-so-needy, not-so-worthy, so-called &#x27;industrial unions&#x27; spawned by an era of compulsory unionism&quot;. He wrote that among Wobblies &quot;there is no one who does not look with a rather jaundiced eye upon the &#x27;success&#x27; of &#x27;Solidarity Forever.&#x27; &quot;I didn&#x27;t write &#x27;Solidarity Forever&#x27; for ambitious politicians or for job-hungry labor fakirs seeking a ride on the gravy train.… All of us deeply resent seeing a song that was uniquely our own used as a singing commercial for the soft-boiled type of post-Wagner Act industrial unionism that uses million-dollar slush funds to persuade their congressional office boys to do chores for them.&quot; He added, &quot;I contend also that when the labor movement ceases to be a Cause and becomes a business, the end product can hardly be called progress.&quot;

Despite Chaplin&#x27;s misgivings, &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot; has retained a general appeal for the wider labor movement because of the continued applicability of its core message. Some performers do not sing all six stanzas of &quot;Solidarity Forever,&quot; typically dropping verses two (&quot;Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite&quot;) and four (&quot;All the world that&#x27;s owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone&quot;), thus leaving out the most radical material.

==Modern additions==
Since the 1970s women have added verses to &quot;Solidarity Forever&quot; to reflect their concerns as union members. One popular set of stanzas is:

:We&#x27;re the women of the union and we sure know how to fight.
:We&#x27;ll fight for women&#x27;s issues and we&#x27;ll fight for women&#x27;s rights.
:A woman&#x27;s work is never done from morning until night.
:Women make the union strong!
:(Chorus)

:It is we who wash the dishes, scrub the floors and clean the dirt,
:Feed the kids and send them off to school—and then we go to work,
:Where we work for half men&#x27;s wages for a boss who likes to flirt.
:But the union makes us strong!
:(Chorus)

A variation from Canada goes as follows:

:We&#x27;re the women of the union in the forefront of the fight,
:We fight for women&#x27;s issues, we fight for women&#x27;s rights,
:We&#x27;re prepared to fight for freedom, we&#x27;re prepared to stand our ground,
:Women make the union strong.
:(Chorus)

:Through our sisters and our brothers, we can make our union strong,
:For respect and equal value we have done without too long,
:We no longer have to tolerate injustices and wrongs,
:For the union makes us strong.
:(Chorus)

:When racism in all of us is finally out and gone,
:Then the union movement will be twice as powerful and strong,
:For equality for everyone will move the cause along,
:For the union makes us strong.
:(Chorus)

The centennial edition of the Little Red Songbook includes these two new verses credited to Steve Suffet:

:They say our day is over; they say our time is through,
:They say you need no union if your collar isn&#x27;t blue,
:Well that is just another lie the boss is telling you,
:For the Union makes us strong!
:(Chorus)

:They divide us by our color; they divide us by our tongue,
:They divide us men and women; they divide us old and young,
:But they&#x27;ll tremble at our voices, when they hear these verses sung,
:For the Union makes us strong!
:(Chorus)
Pete Seeger&#x27;s adaptation of the song removes the second and fourth verses and rewrites the final verse as:

:In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold
:Greater than the might of atoms, magnified a thousand fold,
:We can bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old,
:For the union makes us strong.
:(Chorus)

==In popular culture==
&quot;Solidarity Forever&quot; is featured in the 2014 film &quot;Pride&quot; in which London organisation Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners collect funds to support the miners of a Welsh village during the 1984–1985 UK miners&#x27; strike.

<text>Jazz Jackrabbit is a series of platform games featuring the eponymous character, Jazz Jackrabbit, a green anthropomorphic hare who fights with his nemesis, Devan Shell, in a science fiction parody of the fable &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;. Created by Arjan Brussee and Cliff Bleszinski and developed by Epic Games, the series debuted on MS-DOS in 1994 with &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;. The series consists of two PC games and a handheld game.

== Games ==
===&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; (1994)===

The first &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; game was developed and published by Epic MegaGames and released in 1994 for MS-DOS. Jazz had to rescue Carrotus princess Eva Earlong, who was kidnapped by his nemesis, Devan Shell. The shareware edition was extremely popular and the game was named Arcade Game of the Year by PC Format.

===&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; (1998)===

&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot; was developed by Orange Games and Epic MegaGames, and published by Gathering of Developers in the United States, Project 2 Interactive in Europe and P&amp;A in Japan. Jazz and his siblings, Spaz and Lori, attempt to retrieve Eva&#x27;s stolen wedding ring from Devan. Despite moderate success in Europe, the game was a commercial failure for Gathering of Developers.

===&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 3&quot;===

&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 3&quot; (alternatively called &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 3D: Adventures of a Mean Green Hare&quot;) is the cancelled game of the series. Spearheaded by Dean &quot;Noogy&quot; Dodrill (an animator for &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 2&quot;) and coded by World Tree Games, it was being developed for the Unreal Engine 1 in 1999. As the game&#x27;s alternate name implies, it would have been rendered in 3D. The game was planned for release on PC and PlayStation 2.

Development of the game was ceased part way through in May 2000 as Epic Games was unable to find a publisher; an unfinished demo was subsequently leaked online. While only Jazz is playable in the demo, Spaz and Lori were intended to return as additional playable characters.

Following the events of the preceding game, Jazz Jackrabbit and Eva Earlong settle down in Carrotus Castle and become parents. Devan Shell kidnaps their children, taking them into an alternate universe via a modified time machine.

&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 3&quot; is a third-person shooter with platforming and adventure game elements. The mouse is used to aim and shoot, while the keyboard moves one around the world. The player can fire their weapon, or charge up for a more powerful shot. The arsenal can be expanded using coins collected to purchase new weapons and combine them with Elemental &quot;Dream Cells&quot; to create various weapon effects. In the demo, only Fire and Ice Dream Cells can be acquired, and usable with two guns (the standard Blaster and the Gizmo Gun). 

Unlike the previous installments, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit 3&quot; has no levels. It is instead divided into sections, similar to &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. At specific points in the map, the player can travel back and forth between these sections. Each new area that is visited is prefaced by its name.

===&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; (2002)===

&quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, developed by Game Titan and published by Jaleco under license from Epic Games, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. As a reboot to the series, several changes were done in overall design, oriented towards cosmic science fiction inspired by Star Wars. Jazz was redesigned to resemble Han Solo. Eva and Lori are missing from the game while Devan Shell has been replaced by Dark Shell.

===Other appearances===
Jazz, Devan and Eva make guest appearances in &quot;One Must Fall: 2097&quot; in single-player tournament mode. Each character pilots a fighting mech that is suited to their individual personalities.

At one point, Epic MegaGames was considering an animated series based on &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot;, as evidenced by Epic filing a trademark registration for the name &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; on March 28, 1997. The application contains a description for goods and services which says &quot;entertainment in the nature of animated TV series&quot;.

In December 2010, Epic Games released development kits for the Unreal Engine on iOS. One of the tutorials for these devkits features &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; as a top down twin-stick shooter game.

In 2017, a &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit&quot; easter egg appeared in &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

In August 2022, &quot;Jazz Jackrabbit Doom TC&quot;, a fan conversion mod for &quot;Doom II&quot;, was released. It runs through &quot;GZDoom&quot; or &quot;LZDoom&quot;.

<doc id="664525" wikidata="Q3229408" url="?curid=664525" title="Len Barker">
<text>Leonard Harold Barker III (born July 7, 1955) is an American former Major League Baseball right-handed starting pitcher. He pitched the tenth perfect game in baseball history. Barker pitched with the Texas Rangers (1976–78), Cleveland Indians (1979–83), Atlanta Braves (1983–85) and Milwaukee Brewers (1987). During an 11-year baseball career, Barker compiled 74 wins, 975 strikeouts, and a 4.34 earned run average.

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Barker was a hard thrower, who early in his career struggled with his control. On April 16, 1978, at Fenway Park, Barker (then with the Texas Rangers) threw a pitch that sailed upward onto the screen above and behind the backstop. Partly due to this, he did not make the major leagues until 1979.

Barker was traded, along with Bobby Bonds, from the Rangers to the Indians for Jim Kern and Larvell Blanks on October 3, 1978. His best season statistically was , when he enjoyed career-highs in wins (19) and strikeouts (181, best in the American League).

===1981 perfect game===

Barker&#x27;s most notable accomplishment occurred on May 15, 1981, as a member of the Cleveland Indians. On a cold, damp night in Cleveland, Barker pitched the tenth official perfect game in baseball history, defeating the Toronto Blue Jays, 3–0 (the game was originally reported as the ninth perfect game in major league baseball history until the league later changed the criteria for recognizing a perfect game). The final out of the game was a fly ball caught by Rick Manning in short center field. Barker&#x27;s pitching was so consistent on that night that he never reached ball three against any Blue Jays hitter.

Barker&#x27;s perfect outing, one of only twenty four in the history of Major League Baseball, is also the most recent no-hitter thrown by an Indians pitcher. &quot;I run into people almost every day who want to talk about it&quot;, Barker said in 2006. &quot;Everyone says, &#x27;You&#x27;re probably tired of talking about it.&#x27; I say, &#x27;No, it&#x27;s something to be proud of.&#x27; It&#x27;s a special thing.&quot;

Barker was selected for the 1981 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held in Cleveland on August 9. It was the first game played after a lengthy players&#x27; strike, and Barker pitched two scoreless innings before 72,086 fans in his home stadium.

===Later career===
During the 1983 season, Barker was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler, Brook Jacoby, Rick Behenna and $150,000 cash. The trade was initiated by the Braves, who were in a tight race for first in the National League West Division with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Barker pitched reasonably well down the stretch, notching a 3.82 ERA despite only going 1–3 in his six starts after the trade. After the season, the Braves signed Barker to one of the richest contracts for a pitcher in baseball history to that time, $4 million over five years.

Barker did not pitch as well after the new contract was signed. In 1984, he went 7–8 with a 3.85 ERA before missing the last two months of the season with an elbow injury. The next year, Barker&#x27;s ERA ballooned to 6.35, and he only managed a 2–9 record. He was released at the end of 1986 spring training with three years remaining on his contract. He signed with the Montreal Expos a few weeks later and spent the season with their top affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians. The Expos released him during 1987 spring training, and he finished his career with the Milwaukee Brewers. Meanwhile, Butler and Jacoby went on to become All-Stars.

==Post-playing==
After his playing career, Barker returned to the Cleveland area and founded a construction company with a business partner. He and his wife Eva are the parents of Jared, Blake, and Jacob. He also has three children, Carly, Troy and Lyle with his previous wife, Bonnie. The Barker family currently resides in Geauga County, east of Cleveland. Barker served as the head coach for Division II Notre Dame College in South Euclid until the school&#x27;s closure in 2024.

<doc id="664533" wikidata="Q2801795" url="?curid=664533" title="Staple gun">
<text>A staple gun or powered stapler is a hand-held machine used to drive heavy metal staples into wood, plastic, or masonry. Staple guns are used for many different applications and to affix a variety of materials, including insulation, house wrap, roofing, wiring, carpeting, upholstery, and hobby and craft materials. These devices are also known as &quot;trigger tackers&quot;.

==Types==

There are generally three different types of staple guns distinguished by the power source used to operate the gun: manual, electric (From a cord or battery), and pneumatic (Compressed air). Power staple guns can set staples at a somewhat quicker rate than hand-powered models, but their main advantage is that they can be used continuously for hours with comparatively little fatigue.

Some staple guns have a long nose that allows the staples to be applied into recessed corners. Another special feature may be wire guides for wiring to ensure that the staples will not pierce the wire. The &quot;forward action&quot; staple gun has a handle that points toward the trigger end, in the opposite direction of the traditional staple gun. These tools are easier to squeeze and better place pressure at the front of the tool where the staple is ejected. The first so called &quot;forward action&quot; staple gun was introduced about 1934.

A hammer tacker is a device somewhat similar to a staple gun, except that the mechanical energy from the user&#x27;s muscles is stored—as with a hammer—as momentum of the gun itself, rather than as compression of an internal spring. This type of stapler is typically used for insulation, roofing and carpeting.

For most purposes square end staples are used; but some staplers can take rounded end staples for holding cables against a surface.

Typical staple leg lengths are ″, ″, ″, ″, ″, and ″, or 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 millimetres.

==Comparison with office stapler==
Unlike office staplers, some staple guns lack an anvil, the metal plate with curved slots that office staplers use to bend the legs of the staple inwards or outwards and flatten them against the paper.

Other staple guns have integral anvils. For example, a post stapler can be used to join the bottom flaps of a corrugated box but a blind clincher is used for closing the top of a closed box where post anvils are not possible. Anvils are built into the staple gun and penetrate the corrugated fiberboard: The staple hits the anvils and is crimped onto the box. The curved anvils are then removed.

Most staple guns, especially the hand-powered models, have a spring-like mechanism for storing mechanical energy and delivering it as a sharp and powerful blow. This mechanism is necessary because of the large force needed to drive the staples through solid wood or masonry, and because the staple must be completely inserted before the workpiece has time to move . In the office stapler, by contrast, the staple can be driven directly by the user&#x27;s muscle power, at a relatively slow speed, because the paper is firmly supported by the anvil. In other words, the staple gun substitutes the workpiece&#x27;s inertia for the missing anvil.

<doc id="664537" wikidata="Q321781" url="?curid=664537" title="Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt">
<text>Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Sr. (October 20, 1877 – May 7, 1915) was an American businessman and member of the Vanderbilt family. A sportsman, he participated in and pioneered a number of related endeavors. He died in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, on 7 May 1915, after being torpedoed by a German submarine (SM &quot;U-20&quot;).

== Early life ==
Vanderbilt was born in New York City, the third son of Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899) and Alice Claypoole Gwynne (1845–1934). His siblings were Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt (1869–1874), William Henry Vanderbilt II (1870–1892), Cornelius &quot;Neily&quot; Vanderbilt III (1873–1942), Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942), Reginald Claypoole Vanderbilt (1880–1925) and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt (1886–1965).

Alfred Vanderbilt attended the St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire, and Yale University (Class of 1899), where he was a member of Skull and Bones. Soon after graduation, Vanderbilt, with a party of friends, started on a tour of the world which was to have lasted two years. When the group reached Japan on September 12, 1899, he received news of his father&#x27;s sudden death and hastened home as speedily as possible to find himself, by his father&#x27;s will, the head of his branch of the family.

His eldest brother, William, had died in 1892 at age 22, and their father had disinherited Alfred&#x27;s second-oldest brother Neily due to his marriage to Grace Wilson, a young debutante of whom the elder Vanderbilts strongly disapproved for a variety of reasons. Alfred received the largest share of his father&#x27;s estate, though it was also divided among his sisters and his younger brother, Reginald.

== Career ==

Soon after his return to New York, Vanderbilt began working as a clerk in the offices of the New York Central Railroad as preparation for entering into the councils of the company as one of its principal owners. Subsequently, he was chosen a director in other companies as well, among them the Fulton Chain Railway Company, Fulton Navigation Company, Raquette Lake Railway Company, Raquette Lake Transportation Company, and the Plaza Bank of New York.

Vanderbilt was a good judge of real estate values and projected several important enterprises. On the site of the former residence of the Vanderbilt family and on several adjacent plots, he built the Vanderbilt Hotel at Park Avenue and 34th Street, New York, which he made his city home.

Among Vanderbilt&#x27;s many holdings were positions in the New York Central Railroad, Beech Creek Railroad, Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, Michigan Central Railroad and Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad as well as the Pullman Company.

== Personal life ==
On January 11, 1901, Vanderbilt married Ellen (&quot;Elsie&quot;) Tuck French, in Newport, Rhode Island. She was the daughter of Francis Ormond French (1837–1893) and his wife Ellen Tuck (1838–1915), and was close friends with Vanderbilt&#x27;s sister, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, who was married to Harry Payne Whitney. Later that same year, on November 24, 1901, Elsie gave birth to their only child: William Henry Vanderbilt III (1901–1981), later governor of Rhode Island.

In March 1908, Elsie moved to the home of her brother, Amos Tuck French, in Tuxedo Park, New York. Shortly thereafter, a scandal erupted in April 1908 after Elsie filed for divorce, alleging adultery with Agnes O&#x27;Brien Ruíz, the wife of the Cuban attaché in Washington, D. C. The publicity, which caused splits over whom to support, ultimately led Agnes Ruíz to commit suicide in 1909. Elsie, who remarried, died in Newport on February 27, 1948.

Vanderbilt spent considerable time in London after the divorce, and he remarried there, on December 17, 1911, to the wealthy American divorcée Margaret Mary Emerson (1886–1960). She was the daughter of Captain Isaac Edward Emerson (1859–1931) and Emily Askew Dunn (1854–1921), and was heiress to the Bromo-Seltzer fortune. Margaret had been married from 1902 to 1910 to Dr. Smith Hollins McKim (d. 1932), a wealthy physician of Baltimore. Together, Alfred and Margaret had two children: Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. (1912–1999), a businessman and racehorse breeder, and George Washington Vanderbilt III (1914–1961), a yachtsman and scientific explorer.

After Alfred&#x27;s death aboard the &quot;Lusitania&quot; in 1915, Margaret bought a 316-acre estate in Lenox, Massachusetts, with a 47-room mansion. She remarried twice, first on June 12, 1918, in Lenox to Raymond T. Baker (1875–1935), a politician with whom she had a daughter, Gloria Baker (1920–1975). The claim for Alfred&#x27;s estate was put forward by Margaret, who by that point was already remarried. Estimates as to the size of the Estate vary, with many sources using the 1917 Appraisal of the Estate in the Surrogate&#x27;s Court of New York, which put the net value of the estate in the State of New York, after the payment of all debts and funeral and administration expenses, at $15,594,836.32 (). In 1964, Edwin Hoyt&#x27;s book &quot;The Vanderbilts and their Fortunes&quot; records the total size of Alfred&#x27;s estate at $26,375,000, exclusive of the $6,000,000 he gifted to his brother Cornelius Vanderbilt III following their father&#x27;s death, and the $10,000,000 his first wife received after their divorce. From this amount, $8,000,000 was left to Alfred&#x27;s second wife Margaret ($5,100,930 of this in New York),$500,000 to his brother Reginald, $5,000,000 and the Oakland Farm Estate to Alfred&#x27;s oldest son William H. Vanderbilt III, with the residuary estate being split between his two younger sons Alfred G. Vanderbilt Jr and George Washington Vanderbilt III, whose shares were estimated at $2,553,204 in 1917.

Contemporary newspaper articles reporting on the 1917 appraisal of Alfred&#x27;s estate in the State of New York report that Alfred&#x27;s gross estate was valued at $16,769,314, in addition to a Trust Fund valued at $4,612,086, with a net value of approximately $15,594,000; from this his oldest son William H. Vanderbilt III received the $4,612,086 in Trust, as well as a life interest in $400,000, and the Medal which Congress had gifted to Cornelius &#x27;the Commodore&#x27; Vanderbilt I which had been passed first to William Henry Vanderbilt, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, and then to Alfred.

By the terms of Alfred&#x27;s will, Margaret and his three sons would inherit $1,180,098.18 (). In addition, for their maintenance and for the support and comfort of his widow and children, he expended and contributed approximately $300,000 () annually.

=== Interests ===

Vanderbilt was a sportsman, and he particularly enjoyed fox hunting and coaching. In the late 19th century, he and a number of other millionaires, such as James Hazen Hyde practiced the old English coaching techniques of the early 19th century. Meeting near Holland House in London, the coaching group would take their vehicle for a one-day, two-day, or longer trip along chosen routes through several counties, going to prearranged inns and hotels along the routes. Vanderbilt would frequently drive the coach, in perfectly appareled suit, a coachman or groom. He is recorded as a regular guest at the Burford Bridge Hotel near Box Hill in Surrey where, when driving from London to Brighton, he would stop to take lunch and to collect telegrams. He loved the outdoor experience.
Vanderbilt was a member of the Coaching Club of New York and his coach, which was named &quot;Venture&quot;, was custom built in 1903 by coachbuilders Brewster &amp; Co. The coach, actually a &quot;heavy park drag – made road style&quot; was restored by the Preservation Society of Newport County and is on display at The Breakers.

In 1902, he bought Great Camp Sagamore, on Sagamore Lake in the Adirondacks, from William West Durant. He expanded and improved the property to include flush toilets, a sewer system, and hot and cold running water. He later added a hydroelectric plant and an outdoor bowling alley with an ingenious system for retrieving the balls. Other amenities included a tennis court, a croquet lawn, a 100,000 gallon reservoir, and a working farm.

In 1908, he donated $100,000 to build the Mary Street YMCA (today the Vanderbilt Hotel) in Newport, Rhode Island, in memory of his father Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843–1899). Ground breaking was on August 31, 1908, with the cornerstone laid on November 19, 1908, by Vanderbilt. The dedication was on January 1, 1910.

=== RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; ===
On May 1, 1915, Vanderbilt boarded the bound for Liverpool as a first class passenger. It was a business trip, and he traveled with only his valet, Ronald Denyer, leaving his family at home in New York.

On May 7, off the coast of County Cork, Ireland, German U-boat, torpedoed the ship, triggering a secondary explosion that sank the giant ocean liner within 18 minutes. Vanderbilt and Denyer helped others into lifeboats, and then Vanderbilt gave his lifejacket to save a female passenger. Vanderbilt had promised the young mother of a small baby that he would locate an extra lifevest for her. Failing to do so, he offered her his own life vest, which he proceeded to tie on to her himself, since she was holding her infant child in her arms at the time. Many considered his actions especially noble since he could not swim and he knew there were no other lifevests or lifeboats available. Because of his fame, several people on the &quot;Lusitania&quot; who survived the tragedy were observing him while events unfolded at the time, and so they took note of his actions. He and Denyer were among the 1,199 passengers who did not survive the incident. His body was never recovered.

There has been some historical confusion as to which member of the Vanderbilt family was booked on the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912 and recent studies have determined that not Alfred Vanderbilt but his uncle George Washington Vanderbilt II was actually booked to travel on the &quot;Titanic&quot;, along with his wife Edith and daughter Cornelia.

==Legacy==

A memorial was erected on the A24 London to Worthing Road in Holmwood, just south of Dorking. The inscription reads, &quot;In Memory of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, a gallant gentleman and a fine sportsman who perished in the Lusitania May 7th 1915. This stone is erected on his favorite road by a few of his British coaching friends and admirers&quot;.

A memorial fountain to Vanderbilt is in Vanderbilt Park on Broadway in Newport, Rhode Island, where many members of the Vanderbilt family spent their summers. The memorial reads: &quot;To the Memory of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, who perished on the S.S. Lusitania in the Thirty-eighth year of his age May 7, 1915. Erected by fifty of his friends.&quot;

<text>A throw pillow, or toss pillow, is a small, decorative soft furnishing item made from a wide range of textiles including cotton, linen, silk, leather, microfibre, suede, chenille, and velvet. Throw pillows are commonly used in interior design and come in various shapes, sizes, and decorative elements such as tassels and piped edges. The most common throw pillow designs are square and range from 16 to 24 inches (approx. 40–60 cm). In the UK, a throw pillow is more commonly referred to as a scatter cushion.

<doc id="664546" wikidata="Q3026558" url="?curid=664546" title="Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr.">
<text>Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. (September 22, 1912 – November 12, 1999) was a British-born member of the prominent Vanderbilt railroad family, and a noted figure of American thoroughbred horse racing. He was the youngest-ever member of The Jockey Club, president of Belmont Racetrack, New York, and Pimlico Race Course, Baltimore, and chairman of the board of the New York Racing Association. In World War II, he was decorated for bravery in the South Pacific.

==Noted family; early years==
Vanderbilt was a son of the first Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt, who died a hero in the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;. His mother, Margaret Emerson (daughter of the Bromo-Seltzer inventor Isaac Edward Emerson), was one of America&#x27;s wealthiest women and most sought-after hostesses, operating at least seven large estates around the country. His grandfather, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, had been one of America&#x27;s most revered businessmen; his great-grandfather, William Henry Vanderbilt had been the richest man in the world. &quot;Commodore&quot; Cornelius Vanderbilt started the family fortune in shipping and railroads as the founder of the New York Central Railroad and builder of Grand Central Depot (built 1869–1871), the precursor to Grand Central Terminal, built on approximately the same location, and completed in 1913. Contemporary newspaper articles covering the 1917 appraisal of his father&#x27;s estate in the New York Surrogate&#x27;s Court report that he received $2,553,204 from his father&#x27;s estate, from which he would receive the income, with 25% of his share to vest on his 21st, 25th, 30th, and 35th birthdays.

Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt Jr. was born to American parents in London, England. He was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s School and at Yale, where he entered with the class of 1935, but did not graduate. His mother, Margaret Emerson (1884–1960), gave him a 600-acre (2.4 km2) horse farm in Glyndon, Maryland, called Sagamore Farm, for his 21st birthday, and it was in thoroughbred horse racing that he made his mark. The Vanderbilt family had by then given up control of most of their former railroad interests. Alfred G. Vanderbilt was President of Belmont Racetrack in New York and was the principal owner and president of Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.

When he was called into service for World War II, he captained a PT boat in the South Pacific, earning the Silver Star for bravery. He was promoted to lieutenant, junior grade on March 2, 1944. On his discharge, he returned to racing in a major way.

==Thoroughbred racing==
Vanderbilt was one of the original members of the Westchester Racing Association and a driving force behind thoroughbred racing in America for most of the 20th century. His mother, Margaret Emerson, took him to his first race, the Preakness Stakes, in 1922. He often said, &quot;After that, I was hooked.&quot; On his 21st birthday, his mother gifted him Sagamore Farm, her racing operation in Reisterstown, Maryland, which had been left to her by her father, Isaac Emerson, who was the inventor of Bromo-Seltzer and founder of the Emerson Drug Company, which later became Warner-Lambert.

Vanderbilt personally oversaw the breeding and training of his stable. He bought Pimlico Race Course and was President of Pimlico twice, the first time when he was 20. As a stable owner, his first major acquisition was Discovery, one of the great handicap horses of the age who became his foundation sire.

Vanderbilt was elected to The Jockey Club as the youngest member in its history in 1935 and eventually campaigned four national champions: Discovery, Next Move, Bed O&#x27; Roses and Native Dancer. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he owned and ran Pimlico Racetrack outside Baltimore and arranged the famous match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral in 1938. He was President of Belmont Park and Pimlico at the same time before joining the Navy. During the Second World War, he captained a PT boat in the South Pacific and was awarded the Silver Star for bravery under fire. He then returned to racing, bringing his greatest champion, Native Dancer, to the track in 1952. Native Dancer won all 9 starts as a 2-year-old and was named Horse of the Year. He won every start as a three-year-old too, except the Kentucky Derby, which he lost by a head to Cain Hoy Stable&#x27;s Dark Star. However, Native Dancer was named 3-year-old Male Champion and was Horse of the Year again in his 4th year. All told, he won 21 of 22 starts, with the single second-place finish in the 1953 Kentucky Derby his only career loss. Many consider the Grey Ghost of Sagamore to have been the first Thoroughbred television star, and TV Guide ranked him as a top icon of the era&quot;.

Vanderbilt continued racing throughout his life and served as chairman of the board of the New York Racing Association from 1971 to 1975. The New York Turf Writers voted him &quot;The Man Who Did The Most for Racing&quot; a record four times, posthumously renaming the award in his honor.

==Personal life==
Vanderbilt was married three times. His first marriage was in 1938 to Manuela Mercedes Hudson (1920–1978), a niece of racehorse owner Charles S. Howard. The couple separated and began living apart in December 1940. Before their divorce in 1942, they were the parents of:

* Wendy Maria Vanderbilt (1939–2016), an artist who married Orin Lehman (1920–2008), the long-serving commissioner of the New York State Office of Parks and Recreation.

His second marriage was on October 13, 1945, to Jeanne Lourdes Murray (1919–2013), a sister of Catherine Murray di Montezemolo and granddaughter of Thomas E. Murray. Before their divorce in 1956, they were the parents of:

* Heidi Murray Vanderbilt (1948–2021), who married Jones Harris (b. 1929), the son of actors Ruth Gordon and Jed Harris, in 1971. They had a son named Jack Harris in 1972. Heidi made her Broadway debut in 1965 in Gordon&#x27;s &quot;A Very Rich Woman&quot;, along with Katharine Houghton. She published her first novel, &quot;The Scar Rule&quot;, on her 72nd birthday. 
* Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt III (b. 1949), who married Alison Campbell Platten in 1971. He is the father of screenwriter James Vanderbilt.

In 1957, he married for the third time to Jean Harvey (b. 1937) of the Cudahy meat-packing empire. Before their eventual divorce in 1975, they were the parents of:

* Nicholas Harvey Vanderbilt (1958–1984), who went missing on Mount Robson in British Columbia, and was presumed dead.
* Victoria Emerson Vanderbilt (b. 1959), who married James Weiss.
* Michael Daggett Vanderbilt (b. 1967), who was born in Saratoga Springs, New York.

He died November 12, 1999, at his home in Mill Neck, New York after attending the morning racehorse workouts, two months after his 87th birthday. He was buried in the Vanderbilt Mausoleum on Staten Island, New York.

==In popular culture==
In the early 1950s, he was a regular panelist on the NBC game show &quot;Who Said That?&quot; along with H. V. Kaltenborn, Boris Karloff, and American actress Dagmar.

<doc id="664556" wikidata="Q27673" url="?curid=664556" title="Colorfulness">
<text>Colorfulness, chroma and saturation are attributes of perceived color relating to chromatic intensity. As defined formally by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) they respectively describe three different aspects of chromatic intensity, but the terms are often used loosely and interchangeably in contexts where these aspects are not clearly distinguished. The precise meanings of the terms vary by what other functions they are dependent on.

* Colorfulness is the &quot;attribute of a visual perception according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic (Any color that is absent of white, grey, or black)&quot;. The colorfulness evoked by an object depends not only on its spectral reflectance but also on the strength of the illumination, and increases with the latter unless the brightness is very high (Hunt effect).
* Chroma is the &quot;colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting&quot;. As a result, chroma is mostly only dependent on the spectral properties, and as such is seen to describe the object color. It is how different from a grey &quot;of the same lightness&quot; such an object color appears to be.
* Saturation is the &quot;colorfulness of an area judged in proportion to its brightness&quot;, which in effect is the perceived freedom from whitishness of the light coming from the area. An object with a given spectral reflectance exhibits approximately constant saturation for all levels of illumination, unless the brightness is very high.

As colorfulness, chroma, and saturation are defined as attributes of perception, they can not be physically measured as such, but they can be quantified in relation to psychometric scales intended to be perceptually even—for example, the chroma scales of the Munsell system. While the chroma and lightness of an object are its colorfulness and brightness judged in proportion to the same thing (&quot;the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting&quot;), the saturation of the light coming from that object is in effect the chroma of the object judged in proportion to its lightness. On a Munsell hue page, lines of uniform saturation thus tend to radiate from near the black point, while lines of uniform chroma are vertical.

== Chroma ==
The naïve definition of saturation does not specify its response function. In the CIE XYZ and RGB color spaces, the saturation is defined in terms of additive color mixing, and has the property of being proportional to any scaling centered at white or the white point illuminant. However, both color spaces are non-linear in terms of psychovisually perceived color differences. It is also possible — and sometimes desirable — to define a saturation-like quantity that is linearized in term of the psychovisual perception.

In the CIE 1976 LAB and LUV color spaces, the unnormalized chroma is the radial component of the cylindrical coordinate CIE LCh (lightness, chroma, hue) representation of the LAB and LUV color spaces, also denoted as CIE LCh(ab) or CIE LCh for short, and CIE LCh(uv). The transformation of formula_1 to formula_2 is given by:
formula_3
formula_4
and analogously for CIE LCh(uv).

The chroma in the CIE LCh(ab) and CIE LCh(uv) coordinates has the advantage of being more psychovisually linear, yet they are non-linear in terms of linear component color mixing. And therefore, chroma in CIE 1976 Lab and LUV color spaces is very much different from the traditional sense of &quot;saturation&quot;.

===In color appearance models===

Another, psychovisually even more accurate, but also more complex method to obtain or specify the saturation is to use a color appearance model like CIECAM02. Here, the chroma color appearance parameter might (depending on the color appearance model) be intertwined with e.g. the physical brightness of the illumination or the characteristics of the emitting/reflecting surface, which is more sensible psychovisually.

The CIECAM02 chroma formula_5 for example, is computed from a lightness formula_6 in addition to a naively evaluated color magnitude formula_7 In addition, a colorfulness formula_8 parameter exists alongside the chroma formula_9 It is defined as formula_10 where formula_11 is dependent on the viewing condition.

== Saturation ==
The saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and how much it is distributed across the spectrum of different wavelengths. The purest (most saturated) color is achieved by using just one wavelength at a high intensity, such as in laser light. If the intensity drops, then as a result the saturation drops. To desaturate a color of given intensity in a subtractive system (such as watercolor), one can add white, black, gray, or the hue&#x27;s complement.

Various correlates of saturation follow.

=== CIELUV and CIELAB ===

In CIELUV, saturation is equal to the &quot;chroma&quot; normalized by the &quot;lightness&quot;:
formula_12
where formula_13 is the chromaticity of the white point, and chroma is defined below.

By analogy, in CIELAB this would yield:
formula_14

The CIE has not formally recommended this equation since CIELAB has no chromaticity diagram, and this definition therefore lacks direct connection with older concepts of saturation. Nevertheless, this equation provides a reasonable predictor of saturation, and demonstrates that adjusting the lightness in CIELAB while holding fixed does affect the saturation.

But the following verbal definition of Manfred Richter and the corresponding formula proposed by Eva Lübbe are in agreement with the human perception of saturation:
Saturation is the proportion of pure chromatic color in the total color sensation.
formula_15
where formula_16 is the saturation, formula_17 the lightness and formula_18 is the chroma of the color.

=== CIECAM02 ===

In CIECAM02, saturation equals the square root of the &quot;colorfulness&quot; divided by the &quot;brightness&quot;:
formula_19

This definition is inspired by experimental work done with the intention of remedying CIECAM97s&#x27;s poor performance. formula_8 is proportional to the chroma formula_5 thus the CIECAM02 definition bears some similarity to the CIELUV definition.

=== HSL and HSV===

Saturation is also one of three coordinates in the HSL and HSV color spaces. However, in the HSL color space saturation exists independently of lightness. That is, both a very light color a very dark color can be heavily saturated in HSL; whereas in the previous definitions—as well as in the HSV color space—colors approaching white all feature low saturation.

== Excitation purity ==

The excitation purity (purity for short) of a stimulus is the difference from the illuminant&#x27;s white point to the furthest point on the chromaticity diagram with the same dominant wavelength; using the CIE 1931 color space:
formula_22
where formula_23 is the chromaticity of the white point and formula_24 is the point on the perimeter whose line segment to the white point contains the chromaticity of the stimulus. Different color spaces, such as CIELAB or CIELUV may be used, and will yield different results.

<doc id="664564" wikidata="Q7978708" url="?curid=664564" title="Webbing stretcher">
<text>A webbing stretcher is an upholstery tool used to stretch webbing.

== Chair upholstery ==
Traditional chairs are constructed of an open wooden frame, with their seat often supported by interwoven jute or cotton herringbone webbing. Stuffing is placed upon this, enclosed between hessian, then batting over this and finally the cover fabric. To provide a taut and long-lasting seat, the webbing must be tightened into place. The webbing material must also resist yielding over time, hence the use of a dense herringbone weave, rather than the cheaper hessian webbings also used in upholstery. Where wire springs are to be placed over the webbing, the more abrasion-resistant cotton webbing is used rather than jute.

== Modern webbings ==
In the 1950s, an elastic rubber or &#x27;Pirelli&#x27; webbing became popular. This is made of black rubber, with an internal canvas reinforcement. This webbing is applied by hand and is not tensioned, the elasticity of the rubber being sufficient. It is attached by metal clips, fitting into grooves in the frame. As the webbing is elastic it is only used in parallel strips, rather than being interweaved: friction between these elastic webs moving over each other would soon abrade their edges.

== Stretchers ==
=== Traditional stretchers ===
When the webbing is attached, it is fastened at one end, stretched into place and then held in place with tacks.

Tensioning is done with a simple wooden lever, the webbing stretcher. This looks like a bat or paddle with a simple handle, a locating groove along the opposing edge and a slot in the centre. The webbing is held in place by placing a loop through the slot and locking it with a wooden dowel pin. This pin is usually attached to the stretcher with a short chain or string. Using chain avoids the inconvenient twisting tendency of string.

In use, the grooved edge is located over a convenient edge of the frame to act as the of a lever and the stretcher is levered outwards. As the handle is further away from the fulcrum than the slot, there is a mechanical advantage of about 3:1 in the tensioning force that can be generated, compared to simply pulling.

Stretchers are sold commercially, usually made of beech. Many upholsterers make their own though, from workshop offcuts.

=== Stretcher pliers ===
Plier-type stretchers are sometimes used, particularly with leather strapping that is too short to allow a loop through a traditional stretcher. These have wide ridged jaws to grip the end of a webbing. A protrusion on one jaw acts as the fulcrum of a lever, to give a powerful tensioning force.

=== American or &#x27;gooseneck&#x27; stretchers ===
These are mostly used by direct pulling, rather than levering. A wooden or plastic block has a row of sharp raised point to grip the webbing by piercing it. The block is either held and pushed to tension the webbing, or a turned wooden handle on a gooseneck wire is used to pull it. The other edge of the block is sometimes padded to avoiding marking the frame, but is not as effective a lever as the traditional grooved type. As this type of stretcher is usually used by pulling rather than levering, it tends to leave the webbing slacker than traditionally expected. The pins can also damage the webbing, if used to apply an adequate force. This type is commonly used for making cheap furniture, where rubber webs are stapled permanently into place. As rubber only requires a low tension, they are adequate for this.

<text>Kajto (pronounced ) is a musical group from the Dutch province of Friesland performing acoustic folk music and balfolk in Esperanto drawing from the Frisian musical traditions of sea shanties, rounds and dances. Many of their songs are musical settings of Esperanto poetry, including works by Poul Thorsen, William Auld and Julio Baghy.

Kajto (meaning &quot;kite&quot; in Esperanto) was the name adopted by the Frisian folk group Kat yn &#x27;t Seil in 1988 for their performances of Esperanto material. For most of their history Kat yn &#x27;t Seil and Kajto were identical ensembles performing different repertoires under different names.

The group has performed extensively at Esperanto conventions and events, mostly in Europe, but also in North America and Australia, and released five albums on the label Vinilkosmo as a quartet and one as a duo. 
They have been described as one of the best known pop-folk groups in the Esperanto-speaking community, or Esperantujo, and have been praised for their tight arrangements. In 2004 the group was honored with the Franz Alois Meiners Culture Award (FAME Kulturpremio), which carries considerable prestige within the Esperanto community.

Until about 2007, Kajto consisted of the following members:
* (voice, guitar, mandolin, harmonica, violin)
* Marita Kruijswijk (voice, shawm, recorder)
* Ankie van der Meer (voice, guitar, banjo)
* Marian Nesse (voice, accordion)

The group no longer performs as a quartet; however, Nanne Kalma and Ankie van der Meer continue to perform under the name Kajto as a duo. 

Former Kajto members Marita Kruijswijk and Marian Nesse have formed a new Esperanto folk group, Kapriol&#x27;! with Rutger Dijkstra and Ad Bos. Kapriol&#x27;! continues to perform some material from the repertoire of the original Kajto quartet.

<text>Dynamite Hack is an American post-grunge band formed in Austin, Texas in 1997, taking its name from a line in the film &quot;Caddyshack&quot;, in which Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) describes the marijuana he is smoking as &quot;dynamite hack&quot; to Ty Webb (Chevy Chase).

They are best known for their cover of &quot;Boyz-n-the-Hood&quot;, an acoustic re-imagining of the rap single by Eazy-E. The song was the first single from their 2000 album &quot;Superfast&quot; and peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. In its wake, the group recorded a full-length album, titled &quot;Superfast&quot;, which was released locally in January 2000 and remixed for national distribution by Universal that summer. The single was also used in the tribute to rap&quot; Take a Bite Outta Rhyme: A Rock Tribute to Rap&quot;

According to their Facebook page, Dynamite Hack was expected to release their &quot;lost&quot; second album &quot;How to Break Up a Band&quot; in the summer of 2011. A new track &quot;My Gun&quot; can also be streamed on that page.

The single, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, from the album &quot;How to Break Up a Band&quot; was released on 7/11/11 with 4 non-album bonus tracks.

A country EP, entitled &quot;Beardsley Mitchell&quot;, was released in 2015.

Their newest album &quot;Loaded with Cobras&quot; was released in February 2019.

<text>An upholstery regulator is an upholstery tool that smooths irregularities in the stuffing beneath the coverings. 

While it looks similar to a needle, it is heavier. Like needles, the regulator comes in various gauges and lengths. Upholsterers use it to poke through the multiple layers to adjust the stuffing before putting the final cover in place. 

A related tool is the stuffing iron, which upholsterers use to push the stuffing into the curves and corners of furniture. It has a narrow piece of steel with one toothed edge to grab loose stuffing and place it in hard-to-reach spots.
