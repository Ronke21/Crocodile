<text>Dixie Virginia Carter (May 25, 1939 – April 10, 2010) was an American actress. She starred as Julia Sugarbaker on the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; (1986–1993) and as Randi King on the drama series &quot;Family Law&quot; (1999–2002). She was nominated for the 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Gloria Hodge on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2006–2007).

Carter made her professional stage debut in a Memphis production of the musical &quot;Carousel&quot; in 1960 and made her Broadway debut in the 1974 musical &quot;Sextet&quot;. After appearing for two years as District Attorney Brandy Henderson on the CBS soap &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; (1974–1976), she starred in the 1976 Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Pal Joey&quot;. Her other television roles included the sitcoms &quot;On Our Own&quot; (1977–1978), &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; (1982–1983) and &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (1984–1985). She returned to Broadway to play Maria Callas in the play &quot;Master Class&quot; in 1997 and to play Mrs. Meers in the musical &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; in 2004.

==Early life==
Dixie Virginia Carter was born May 25, 1939, to Esther Virginia (née Hillsman) and Halbert Leroy Carter in McLemoresville, Tennessee. Carter spent many of her early years in Memphis. She attended the University of Memphis and Rhodes College.

In college, she was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority. In 1959, Carter competed in the Miss Tennessee pageant, where she placed first runner-up to Mickie Weyland. Carter won the Miss Volunteer beauty pageant at the University of Tennessee the same year.

==Career==
In 1960, Carter made her professional stage debut in a Memphis production of &quot;Carousel&quot;, co-starring George Hearn, whom she would go on to marry 17 years later. She moved to New York City in 1963 and got a part in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In 1967, she began an eight-year hiatus from acting, to focus on raising her two daughters; she returned to acting in 1974, when she filled in for actress Nancy Pinkerton as Dorian Cramer on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; while Pinkerton was on maternity leave. She subsequently was cast in the role of Assistant D.A. Olivia Brandeis &quot;Brandy&quot; Henderson on the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; from 1974 to 1976. Carter took the role though some advised her that doing a daytime soap might negatively affect her career. However, she was first noticed in this role, and after leaving &quot;Edge of Night&quot; in 1977, she appeared in several episodes of another soap opera, &quot;The Doctors&quot; as socialite Linda Elliott. She relocated from New York to Los Angeles and pursued prime-time television roles. In 1976, she won the &quot;Theater World&quot; Award for &quot;Jesse and the Bandit Queen&quot;.

She appeared in series such as &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (as Aunt Marion), &quot;On Our Own&quot; (as April Baxter), &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; (as the first Maggie McKinney Drummond, Phillip Drummond&#x27;s second wife), &quot;The Greatest American Hero&quot; (playing a KGB spy) and as the stuck up and conniving Carlotta Beck on &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; (1982).

Carter&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; paved the way for her most notable role, that of sharp tongued liberal interior decorator Julia Sugarbaker in the 1986–1993 television program &quot;Designing Women&quot;, set in Atlanta. &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; was created by Linda Bloodworth Thomason, who also created &quot;Designing Women&quot;. (In the beginning, without knowing the content of the show, Bloodworth-Thomason&#x27;s only idea was to create a show starring Carter and fellow castmates Delta Burke, Annie Potts and Jean Smart. &quot;Filthy Rich&quot; also featured fellow &quot;Designing Women&quot; cast member Delta Burke in its cast.) After much persuasion from creators Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband Harry Thomason, Hal Holbrook, Carter&#x27;s real-life husband, had a recurring role as attorney Reese Watson. Carter&#x27;s daughters Ginna and Mary Dixie Carter also had guest star roles as Julia Sugarbaker&#x27;s nieces Jennifer and Camilla in the episode &quot;The Naked Truth&quot; in 1989.

In 1997, Carter starred as Maria Callas in Terrence McNally&#x27;s play &quot;Master Class&quot;. She played the role from January to June. The role previously had been played by Zoe Caldwell and Patti LuPone.

Noted for portraying strong-minded Southern women, Carter provided the voice of Necile in Mike Young Productions&#x27; cartoon feature &quot;The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus&quot;. She was also in the voice cast of &quot;My Neighbors the Yamadas&quot;, the English language dub of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s 1999 anime movie of the same.

From 1999 to 2002, she portrayed Randi King on the legal drama &quot;Family Law&quot;. From 1999 to 2000, she was a cast member on the short-lived sitcom &quot;Ladies Man,&quot; appearing as a regular on both &quot;Ladies Man&quot; and &quot;Family Law&quot;. In 2004, she made a guest appearance on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, playing a defense attorney named Denise Brockmorton in the episode called &quot;Home&quot;, in which she defended the paranoid mother of two children (Diane Venora) who had manipulated her older son to kill the younger son after breaking her home rules.

In 2006–2007, Carter found a resurgence of fame with a new generation of fans portraying Gloria Hodge, Bree Van de Kamp&#x27;s disturbed (and scheming) mother-in-law on &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. Creator Marc Cherry started in Hollywood as Carter&#x27;s assistant on the set of &quot;Designing Women&quot;. Her first and only Emmy Awards nomination was for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards under the category of Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her role as Gloria Hodge.

Carter gave an interview in 2006 for the feature-length documentary &quot;That Guy: The Legacy of Dub Taylor&quot;, which received support from Taylor&#x27;s family and many of Dub&#x27;s previous coworkers, including Bill Cosby, Peter Fonda, Don Collier, Cheryl Rogers-Barnett and many others. The project was scheduled to have its world premiere at Taylor&#x27;s childhood hometown of Augusta, Georgia on April 14, 2007.

Her final film was &quot;That Evening Sun&quot;, which she filmed with her husband Hal Holbrook in East Tennessee in summer 2008. The film, produced by Dogwood Entertainment (a subsidiary of DoubleJay Creative), is based on a short story by William Gay. &quot;That Evening Sun&quot; premiered at South By Southwest, where it competed for the narrative feature grand jury prize.

==Personal life==

In 1967, Carter married businessman Arthur Carter (no relation). Arthur published New York Observer. Following the birth of their daughters-- Mary Dixie (1968) and Ginna(1970)-- Carter left acting for eight years to raise the girls and with Arthur&#x27;s three children, Jon, Whendy and Ellen Carter.

She divorced Arthur Carter in 1977 and married theater and TV actor George Hearn the same year. Two years later, she and Hearn divorced. She married Hal Holbrook in 1984.

In 1996, Carter published a memoir titled &quot;Trying to Get to Heaven&quot;, in which she talked frankly about her life with Holbrook, &quot;Designing Women&quot; and her plastic surgery during the show&#x27;s run. She acknowledged, along with other celebrities, having used human growth hormone for its antiaging properties.

=== Political views ===

Carter was a registered Republican who described her political views as libertarian. She was interviewed by Bill O&#x27;Reilly along with Pat Boone at the 2000 Republican National Convention, and once jokingly described herself as &quot;the only Republican in show business&quot;. However, Carter&#x27;s &quot;Designing Women&quot; character, Julia Sugarbaker, was known for her liberal political views and related speeches, for which she was nicknamed &quot;The Terminator.&quot; Carter disagreed with some of her character&#x27;s beliefs, and made a deal with the show&#x27;s producers that if Julia delivered a &quot;Terminator&quot; monologue, she would get to sing a song in a future episode. In later years she was also a libertarian Republican who supported civil rights and same-sex marriage.

==Death and legacy==
On April 10, 2010, Carter died in Houston at the age of 70, from complications of endometrial cancer. She was interred in McLemoresville, Tennessee.

The Dixie Carter Performing Arts and Academic Enrichment Center (informally called &quot;The Dixie&quot;) in Huntingdon, Tennessee, is named in honor of Carter.

A public service announcement made by Carter in 2003 describing and offering outreach to people with spasmodic torticollis/cervical dystonia began appearing in New York and New Jersey and then across the United States in 2010.

<doc id="684771" wikidata="Q177930" url="?curid=684771" title="Enemy of the State (film)">
<text>Enemy of the State is a 1998 American political action thriller film directed by Tony Scott, written by David Marconi, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and starring Will Smith and Gene Hackman with an ensemble supporting cast consisting of Jon Voight, Regina King, Loren Dean, Jake Busey, Barry Pepper and Gabriel Byrne. In the film, a lawyer is targeted by a group of corrupt National Security Agency (NSA) agents after he unknowingly receives a tape of the agents murdering a congressman.

&quot;Enemy of the State&quot; was released on November 20, 1998, by Buena Vista Pictures through its Touchstone Pictures label. The film grossed $250.8 million worldwide, and received generally positive reviews from film critics, with many praising the writing and direction as well as the chemistry between Smith and Hackman.

==Plot==
Congressman Phil Hammersley wants to block the passage of a new piece of counterterrorism legislation that would expand the surveillance powers of American intelligence agencies, thinking that the potential benefits of the bill are not worth sacrificing the privacy rights of ordinary citizens for. NSA Assistant Director Thomas Reynolds, wanting the bill passed to obtain a promotion, has agents loyal to him murder Hammersley and stage his death as a car accident following a heart attack.

Labor lawyer Robert Clayton Dean works on a case involving restaurant owner and mob boss Paulie Pintero. Dean occasionally hires &quot;Brill&quot;, a man whom he has never met in person, to conduct surveillance operations. Brill obtains a tape incriminating Pintero for labor racketeering. Dean threatens Pintero with the tape to ensure that the mobster agrees to a favorable settlement.

Reynolds and his team spot biologist Daniel Zavitz swapping out a tape from a remote wildlife camera stationed near the murder scene. After viewing footage of the murder, Zavitz contacts a journalist to publicize the tape. Reynolds&#x27; team intercepts the call and go after Zavitz, who transfers the video to a disc. While fleeing, he bumps into Dean, his old college friend. Panicked, Zavitz slips the disc into Dean&#x27;s shopping bag without his knowledge. He runs into the path of an oncoming fire truck and dies, while Reynolds has the journalist murdered.

Looking for the disc, Reynolds&#x27; team identify Dean and visit him disguised as cops. When Dean refuses to let them search his belongings without a warrant, the agents erroneously believe that he is knowingly withholding the disc. They break into Dean&#x27;s house while he and his family are out and plant bugs in his clothes and personal effects. They also disseminate false evidence that Dean is laundering money through his firm for Pintero and having an affair with Rachel Banks (Dean&#x27;s ex-girlfriend and Brill&#x27;s courier). Dean is fired from his law firm, his bank accounts are frozen pending a federal investigation, and his wife Carla throws him out. Dean asks Rachel to contact Brill for help. Reynolds intercepts the call and sends someone to impersonate Brill. The real Brill rescues Dean and warns him that the NSA is responsible for ruining his life. Dean later finds Rachel killed in her home.

Dean finds the disc and shows it to Brill, who identifies Reynolds. The NSA agents raid Brill&#x27;s hideout; Brill and Dean escape but the disc is destroyed in a car fire. Brill is actually Edward Lyle, a former NSA communications expert stationed in Iran during the Iranian Revolution. His partner, Rachel&#x27;s father, was killed, but Lyle escaped and has been working covertly ever since, employing Rachel as a courier to watch over her. Lyle urges Dean to start a new life. Dean, however, insists on clearing his name. He and Lyle trail Congressman Sam Albert, a key supporter of the bill, and record a videotape of him with his mistress. Dean and Lyle hide an NSA listening device in Albert&#x27;s hotel room, knowing that he will find it. Lyle then hacks into Reynolds&#x27; personal bank account and deposits money to make it look like he is being paid to blackmail Albert.

A meeting is arranged with Reynolds to exchange the video so he can be tricked into incriminating himself. Reynolds&#x27; men instead ambush the meeting and hold Lyle and Dean at gunpoint, demanding the tape. Dean lies, saying that the evidence is hidden at Pintero&#x27;s restaurant, which is under FBI surveillance. He then tricks Pintero and Reynolds into believing that the other man has the tape. The encounter escalates into a firefight when a gangster shoots an NSA agent in the back; Pintero, his men, Reynolds, and almost all of his agents are killed. Meanwhile, Lyle sends the FBI a live feed of the incident to trigger a raid on the restaurant before escaping in disguise. Dean is rescued, the survivors are arrested, and the conspiracy is exposed.

To avoid scandal, Congress abandons the bill, while the NSA executes a cover-up of Reynolds&#x27; actions. Dean is cleared of all charges and reconciles with Carla. Lyle sends Dean a message via his TV, showing himself relaxing on a tropical island with his cat.

==Production==
The story is set in both Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and most of the filming was done in Baltimore. Location shooting began on a ferry in Fell&#x27;s Point. In mid-January, the company moved to Los Angeles to complete production in April 1998. David Marconi spent over two years developing his original script at Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer Films under the direction of Lucas Foster, their development executive at the time. Oliver Stone expressed early interest in directing Marconi&#x27;s script, but ultimately Jerry Bruckheimer went with Tony Scott who he had a long standing relationship with because of their previous collaborations. The writers Aaron Sorkin, Henry Bean and Tony Gilroy each performed an uncredited rewrite of the script.

Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise were considered for the part that went to Will Smith, who took the role largely because he wanted to work with Gene Hackman, and had previously enjoyed working with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer on &quot;Bad Boys&quot;. George Clooney was also considered for a role in the film. Sean Connery was considered for the role that went to Hackman. The film is notable for having cast several soon-to-be stars in smaller supporting roles, which casting director Victoria Thomas credited to people&#x27;s interest in working with Gene Hackman.

The film&#x27;s crew included a technical surveillance counter-measures consultant who also had a minor role as a spy shop merchant. Hackman had previously acted in a similar thriller about spying and surveillance, &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974). The photo in Edward Lyle&#x27;s NSA file is of Hackman in &quot;The Conversation&quot;.

&quot;Enemy of the State&quot; grossed $111.5 million in the United States and $139.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $250.8 million, against a production budget of $90 million.

The film opened at #2, behind &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot;, grossing $20 million over its first weekend at 2,393 theaters, averaging $8,374 per venue. It made $18.1 million in its second weekend and $9.7 million in its third, finishing third place both times.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; holds an approval rating of 71% based on 84 reviews, with an average rating of 6.44/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;An entertaining, topical thriller that finds director Tony Scott on solid form and Will Smith confirming his action headliner status.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a normalized score of 67 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A− on an A+ to F scale.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; expressed enjoyment in the movie, noting how its &quot;pizazz [overcame] occasional lapses in moment-to-moment plausibility&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; approved of the film&#x27;s action-packed sequences, but cited how it was similar in manner to the rest of the members of &quot;Simpson&#x27;s and Bruckheimer&#x27;s school of empty but sensation-packed filming&quot;. In a combination of the two&#x27;s views, Edvins Beitiks of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; praised many of the movie&#x27;s development aspects, but criticized the overall concept that drove the film from the beginning—the efficiency of government intelligence—as unrealistic. Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; felt &quot;the climax edges perilously close to the ridiculous&quot; but overall enjoyed the film, particularly Voight and Hackman&#x27;s performances.

Kim Newman considered &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; a &quot;continuation of &quot;The Conversation&quot;&quot;, the 1974 psychological thriller that starred Hackman as a paranoid, isolated surveillance expert.

==Undeveloped television series==
In October 2016, ABC announced it had green-lit a television series sequel to the film, with Bruckheimer to return as producer. The series would take place two decades after the original film, where &quot;an elusive NSA spy is charged with leaking classified intelligence, an idealistic female attorney must partner with a hawkish FBI agent to stop a global conspiracy&quot;. However, nothing ever came to fruition.

==Real life==

An episode of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Nova&quot; titled &quot;Spy Factory&quot; reported that the film&#x27;s portrayal of the NSA&#x27;s capabilities was fiction: although the agency can intercept transmissions, connecting the dots is difficult. However, in 2001, the then-NSA director Gen. Michael Hayden, who was appointed to the position during the release of the film, told CNN&#x27;s Kyra Phillips that &quot;I made the judgment that we couldn&#x27;t survive with the popular impression of this agency being formed by the last Will Smith movie.&quot; James Risen wrote in his 2006 book &quot;State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration&quot; that Hayden &quot;was appalled&quot; by the film&#x27;s depiction of the NSA, and sought to counter it with a PR campaign on behalf of the agency.

Given the events of 9/11, the Patriot Act and Edward Snowden&#x27;s revelations about the NSA&#x27;s PRISM surveillance program, the film has become noteworthy for being ahead of its time regarding issues of national security and privacy.

In June 2013, the NSA&#x27;s PRISM and Boundless Informant programs for domestic and international surveillance were uncovered by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as the result of information provided by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. This information revealed capabilities such as collection of Internet browsing, e-mail and telephone data of not only many Americans, but citizens of other nations as well. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s John Patterson argued that Hollywood depictions of NSA surveillance, including &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; and &quot;Echelon Conspiracy&quot;, had &quot;softened&quot; up the American public to &quot;the notion that our spending habits, our location, our every movement and conversation, are visible to others whose motives we cannot know&quot;.

<text>Roland A. Wank (1898–1970) was a Hungarian-American modernist architect, best known for his work for the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States.

Wank was educated at the Royal Joseph Technical University in Budapest. He worked as an architect in Austria until 1924 when he emigrated to the United States.

Wank was recruited by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933 as that organization&#x27;s first chief architect. His first work for them was to design Norris, a settlement for TVA workers. He went on to redesign the Norris Dam itself, taking the existing engineering proposal and simplifying its overall appearance, removing ornament, and pulling the structural masses into a more coherent and dramatic spatial composition. Wank also opened the powerhouse to public view, with a reception room staffed with information officers. Although the original engineers were not pleased, the TVA Board was, and Wank went on to give a distinctively modern look to subsequent TVA projects like the Fontana Dam, the Chickamauga Dam, and the Hiwassee Dam.

At the Fontana Dam, Wank collaborated with well-known industrial architect Albert Kahn on the design of &quot;A-6&quot; prefabricated house types in the workers&#x27; town of Fontana, North Carolina, meant to house 5000 workers. Fontana Village is now a resort. Wank also went on to collaborate with Fellheimer &amp; Wagner as the design architects for the Cincinnati Union Terminal building, many corporate buildings in New York and New Jersey, structures for the New Jersey Turnpike and a branch department store (1951) in Montclair, New Jersey for Newark-based Hahne &amp; Company. </text><links>

<text>The Southern College of Optometry is a privately owned educational institution located in Memphis, Tennessee. It specializes in optometry and offers a comprehensive program in this field.

==History==
The Southern College of Optometry (SCO) is a private, non-profit educational institution that was established in 1932 by J.J. Horton, an ophthalmologist. It has a long history of providing optometry education and has graduated numerous optometrists from various states and countries. In 1953, a new clinical facility was opened at its current location, which has since undergone expansions to accommodate administrative offices, classrooms, and a library.

In 1970, SCO moved to its present structure, which includes multimedia classrooms, laboratories, faculty and administrative offices, a library, a student center, a computer learning resource center, and an outpatient clinic called the Eye Institute. The Eye Center at SCO, established in 2002, is a large, free-standing facility spanning 46,000 square feet (4,300 m2). It serves a significant number of patients annually and is recognized as one of the largest eye and vision centers in the United States. The center is equipped with advanced examination rooms, technology-based testing spaces, retinal laser and digital angiography centers, an optical shop, and on-site ophthalmology services.

In 2013, the college finished a multimillion-dollar building new classrooms, study areas, and labs., which included the addition of classrooms, study areas, and laboratories. In January 2016, Lewis N. Reich became the new president of the college.

==Work==
The Eye Center at the Southern College of Optometry provides comprehensive care for over 60,000 patients annually, catering to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of eye diseases as well as chronic eye health and visual disorders. It offers a wide range of services, including thorough eye examinations for patients of all ages. As one of the largest facilities of its kind in the United States, it houses 70 fully equipped examination rooms, 14 individual spaces for advanced technology-based testing, a retinal laser center, a digital angiography center, a full-service optical shop, and on-site ophthalmology services.

Functioning similarly to a teaching hospital, The Eye Center serves as a primary healthcare facility, attending to patients primarily from Memphis/Shelby County, West Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The center is led by James E. Venable, Vice President for Clinical Programs, and Christopher Lievens, Chief of Staff.

===Health care services===

<text>Pericarditis () is inflammation of the pericardium, the fibrous sac surrounding the heart. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain, which may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. The pain is typically less severe when sitting up and more severe when lying down or breathing deeply. Other symptoms of pericarditis can include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. The onset of symptoms can occasionally be gradual rather than sudden.
The cause of pericarditis often remains unknown but is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. Diagnosis is based on the presence of chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart. A heart attack may produce similar symptoms to pericarditis.
Treatment in most cases is with NSAIDs and possibly the anti-inflammatory medication colchicine. Steroids may be used if these are not appropriate. Symptoms usually improve in a few days to weeks but can occasionally last months. Complications can include cardiac tamponade, myocarditis, and constrictive pericarditis. Pericarditis is an uncommon cause of chest pain. About 3 per 10,000 people are affected per year. Those most commonly affected are males between the ages of 20 and 50. Up to 30% of those affected have more than one episode.
==Signs and symptoms==
Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom portion of scapula on the back) is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain is usually relieved by sitting up or bending forward, and worsened by lying down (both recumbent and supine positions) or by inspiration (taking a breath in). The pain may resemble that of angina but differs in that pericarditis pain changes with body position, where heart attack pain is generally constant and pressure-like. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue, and anxiety.

Due to its similarity to the pain of myocardial infarction (heart attack), pericarditis can be misdiagnosed as a heart attack. Acute myocardial infarction can also cause pericarditis, but the presenting symptoms often differ enough to warrant diagnosis. The following table organizes the clinical presentation of pericarditis differential to myocardial infarction:

===Physical examinations===
The classic sign of pericarditis is a friction rub heard with a stethoscope on the cardiovascular examination, usually on the lower left sternal border. Other physical signs include a person in distress, positional chest pain, diaphoresis (excessive sweating); possibility of heart failure in form of pericardial tamponade causing pulsus paradoxus, and the Beck&#x27;s triad of low blood pressure (due to decreased cardiac output), distant (muffled) heart sounds, and distension of the jugular vein (JVD). The presence of a triphasic pericardial friction rub on auscultation. A bedside electrocardiogram (ECG) shows widespread concave ST elevation and PR depression throughout most of the limb and precordial leads.

===Complications===
Pericarditis can progress to pericardial effusion and eventually cardiac tamponade. This can be seen in people who are experiencing the classic signs of pericarditis but then show signs of relief, and progress to show signs of cardiac tamponade which include decreased alertness and lethargy, pulsus paradoxus (decrease of at least 10 mmHg of the systolic blood pressure upon inspiration), low blood pressure (due to decreased cardiac index), (jugular vein distention from right sided heart failure and fluid overload), distant heart sounds on auscultation, and equilibration of all the diastolic blood pressures on cardiac catheterization due to the constriction of the pericardium by the fluid.

In such cases of cardiac tamponade, EKG or Holter monitor will then depict electrical alternans indicating wobbling of the heart in the fluid filled pericardium, and the capillary refill might decrease, as well as severe vascular collapse and altered mental status due to hypoperfusion of body organs by a heart that can not pump out blood effectively.

The diagnosis of tamponade can be confirmed with trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE), which should show a large pericardial effusion and diastolic collapse of the right ventricle and right atrium. Chest X-ray usually shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette (&quot;water bottle&quot; appearance) and clear lungs. Pulmonary congestion is typically not seen because equalization of diastolic pressures constrains the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to the intra-pericardial pressure (and all other diastolic pressures).

==Causes==
===Infectious===
Pericarditis may be caused by viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.

In the developing world the bacterial disease tuberculosis is a common cause, whereas in the developed world viruses are believed to be the cause of about 85% of cases. Viral causes include coxsackievirus, herpesvirus, mumps virus, and HIV among others. Also observed by James Blachly, Strep Throat can also cause pericarditis due to the heart sac filling up.

Pneumococcus or tuberculous pericarditis are the most common bacterial forms. Anaerobic bacteria can also be a rare cause. Fungal pericarditis is usually due to histoplasmosis, or in immunocompromised hosts Aspergillus, Candida, and Coccidioides. The most common cause of pericarditis worldwide is infectious pericarditis with tuberculosis.

===Other===
* Idiopathic: No identifiable cause found after routine testing.
* Autoimmune disease: systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic fever, IgG4-related disease
* Myocardial infarction
** Dressler&#x27;s syndrome
** Peri-Myocardial Infarction Pericarditis
* Trauma to the heart
* Uremia (uremic pericarditis)
* Cancer
* Side effect of some medications, e.g. isoniazid, cyclosporine, hydralazine, warfarin, and heparin
* Radiation induced
* Aortic dissection
* Postpericardiotomy syndrome—such as after CABG surgery
* Vaccines-such as smallpox and COVID-19 Vaccines in rare yet documented instances.

In August 2024, a team of Japanese researchers analyzed the data stored on the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database and investigated the link between Covid-19 vaccination and myocarditis and pericarditis. They found an association between mRNA injections and the heart diseases at statistically significant levels: the reporting odds ratio were 15.64(BNT162b2) and 54.23(mRNA-1273) for myocarditis, and 15.78(BNT162b2) and 27.03(mRNA-1273) for pericarditis.

==Diagnosis==


The preferred initial diagnostic testing is the ECG, which may demonstrate a 12-lead electrocardiogram with diffuse, non-specific, concave (&quot;saddle-shaped&quot;), ST-segment elevations in all leads except aVR and V1 and PR-segment depression possible in any lead &quot;except aVR&quot;; sinus tachycardia, and low-voltage QRS complexes can also be seen if there is subsymptomatic levels of pericardial effusion. The PR depression is often seen early in the process as the thin atria are affected more easily than the ventricles by the inflammatory process of the pericardium.

Since the mid-19th century, retrospective diagnosis of pericarditis has been made upon the finding of adhesions of the pericardium.

When pericarditis is diagnosed clinically, the underlying cause is often never known; it may be discovered in only 16–22 percent of people with acute pericarditis.

===Imaging===
On MRI T2-weighted spin-echo images, inflamed pericardium will show high signal intensity. Late gadolinium contrast will show uptake of contrast by the inflamed pericardium. Normal pericardium will not show any contrast enhancement.

===Laboratory test===
Laboratory values can show increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or increased blood creatinine in cases of uremic pericarditis. Generally, however, laboratory values are normal, but if there is a concurrent myocardial infarction (heart attack) or great stress to the heart, laboratory values may show increased cardiac markers like Troponin (I, T), CK-MB, Myoglobin, and LDH1 (lactase dehydrogenase isotype 1).

===Classification===
Pericarditis can be classified according to the composition of the fluid that accumulates around the heart.

Types of pericarditis include the following:
* serous
* purulent
* fibrinous
* caseous
* hemorrhagic

====Acute vs. chronic====
Depending on the time of presentation and duration, pericarditis is divided into &quot;acute&quot; and &quot;chronic&quot; forms. Acute pericarditis is more common than chronic pericarditis, and can occur as a complication of infections, immunologic conditions, or even as a result of a heart attack (myocardial infarction), as Dressler&#x27;s syndrome. Chronic pericarditis however is less common, a form of which is constrictive pericarditis. The following is the clinical classification of acute vs. chronic:
* &quot;Clinically&quot;: Acute (&lt;6 weeks), Subacute (6 weeks to 6 months) and Chronic (&gt;6 months)

==Treatment==
The treatment in viral or idiopathic pericarditis is with aspirin, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs such as ibuprofen). Colchicine may be added to the above as it decreases the risk of further episodes of pericarditis. The drug that helps treat the condition that has developed is aspirin. In this case, the patient is experiencing post-myocardial infarction pericarditis (PIP), which is characterized by chest pain, low-grade fever, and specific findings on physical examination and electrocardiogram. Aspirin is the drug of choice for PIP and is usually already prescribed for secondary prevention following a myocardial infarction. Aspirin acts as an anti-inflammatory drug and helps alleviate the symptoms of pericarditis

Severe cases may require one or more of the following:
* antibiotics to treat tuberculosis or other bacterial causes
* steroids are used in acute pericarditis but are not favored bPrednisone is effective in treating acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis,
* pericardiocentesis to treat a large pericardial effusion causing tamponade

Recurrent pericarditis resistant to colchicine and anti-inflammatory steroids may benefit from a number of medicines that affect the action of interleukin 1; they cannot be taken in tablet form. These are anakinra, canakinumab and rilonacept. Rilonacept has been specifically approved as an orphan drug for use in this situation. Immunosuppressive agents, such as Azathioprine and intravenous immunoglobulins, are a novel therapeutic agent which have been effective in treating and preventing recurrent pericarditis, though research on these therapies is limited.

Surgical removal of the pericardium, pericardiectomy, may be used in severe cases and where the pericarditis is causing constriction, impairing cardiac function. It is less effective if the pericarditis is a consequence of trauma, in elderly patients, and if the procedure is done incompletely. It carries a risk of death between 5 and 10%.

==Epidemiology==
About 30% of people with viral pericarditis or pericarditis of an unknown cause have one or several recurrent episodes.

<text>Pericardiocentesis (PCC), also called pericardial tap, is a medical procedure where fluid is aspirated from the pericardium (the sac enveloping the heart).

== Anatomy and physiology ==

The pericardium is a fibrous sac surrounding the heart composed of two layers: an inner visceral pericardium and an outer parietal pericardium. The area between these two layers is known as the pericardial space and normally contains 15 to 50 mL of serous fluid. This fluid protects the heart by serving as a shock absorber and provides lubrication to the heart during contraction.

The elastic nature of the pericardium allows it to accommodate a small amount of extra fluid, roughly 80 to 120 mL, in the acute setting. However, once a critical volume is reached, even small amounts of extra fluid can rapidly increase pressure within the pericardium. This pressure can significantly hinder the ability of the heart to contract, leading to cardiac tamponade. If accumulation of fluid is slow and occurs over weeks to months, the pericardial sac can tolerate several liters of additional fluid without substantially hindering the ability of the heart to pump.

== Indications ==
Indications for performing pericardiocentesis can be divided into those that are therapeutic (i.e. treating tamponade) and those that are diagnostic (i.e. pericardial fluid analysis).

===Therapeutic pericardiocentesis===

==== Cardiac tamponade ====
Pericardiocentesis can be used to diagnose and treat cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency in which excessive accumulation of fluid within the pericardium (pericardial effusion) creates increased pressure. This prevents the heart from filling normally with blood. This can critically decrease the amount of blood that is pumped from the heart, causing obstructive shock, which can be lethal. The removal of the excess fluid reverses this dangerous process, and is often the first treatment for cardiac tamponade due to its speed.

==== Pericarditis ====
Pericardiocentesis can relieve the symptoms of pericarditis. There may be a normal amount of pericardial fluid, but inflammation still causes compression of the heart. Removal of some of this fluid reduces pressure on the heart.

===Diagnostic pericardiocentesis===
==== Analysis of pericardial fluid ====
Pericardiocentesis can also be used to analyze the fluid surrounding the heart. Fluid may be analyzed to differentiate a number of conditions, including:
* infection
* spread of cancer
* autoimmune conditions, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis

== Contraindications ==
===Absolute contraindications===
There are no absolute contraindications to pericardiocentesis in emergency situations where a patient is hemodynamically unstable.

===Relative contraindications===

==== Long-term drainage ====
Pericardiocentesis is a one-off procedure, which may not be appropriate for long-term drainage. In cases where longer term drainage is needed, the cardiothoracic surgeon can create a pericardial window. This involves the removal of a section of the pericardium, and the placement of a chest tube.

==== Aortic dissection ====
Pericardiocentesis is not appropriate if cardiac tamponade is associated with aortic dissection. In this case, there is a high risk of the procedure worsening this aortic dissection by causing haemorrhage.

==== Diagnosis of minor pericardial effusion ====
Pericardiocentesis is not usually useful for diagnosis of more minor pericardial effusion.

==== Other ====
Other relative contraindications include coagulopathies, thrombocytopenia, myocardial rupture, severe pulmonary hypertension, prior thoracoabdominal surgery, prosthetic heart valves, pacemakers and other cardiac devices, inadequate visualization of the effusion on ultrasound during the procedure, and situations in which more appropriate treatment options are available.

== Procedure ==

===Overview===
The patient undergoing pericardiocentesis is positioned supine with the head of the bed raised between a 30- and 60-degree angle. This places the heart in proximity to the chest wall for easier insertion of the needle into the pericardial sac. For patients that are awake, a local anaesthetic is applied. A large needle is inserted through the skin of the chest into the pericardium, and the practitioner aspirates the pericardial effusion into a syringe. If needed, a drain can be placed using the Seldinger technique for continuous access.

===Approaches===

There are multiple locations that pericardiocentesis can be performed without puncturing the lungs.
* In the past, the standard location was through the infrasternal angle and is also called subxiphoid approach. The needle is inserted at an angle between 30 and 45 degrees to the chest 1 cm inferior to the left xiphocostal angle.
* Another location is through the 5th or 6th intercostal space at the left sternal border at the cardiac notch of the left lung, and is also called as parasternal approach. The needle is inserted at an angle of 90 degrees to the chest. Some evidence suggests that this poses lower risk of vascular damage in adults.
* With the routine use of ultrasound guidance, the apical approach is becoming more widely used. The needle is inserted at the level of the cardiac apex, usually between the 5th-7th intercostal space. The needle is advanced directly over the superior aspect of the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle and aimed toward the right shoulder.

===Ultrasound guidance===
Pericardiocentesis should be performed with ultrasound guidance whenever possible to prevent complications. This allows practitioners to assess the location of the pericardial effusion and identify adjacent structures. With ultrasound guidance, an apical approach is most often used, but parasternal and subxiphoid approaches can also be used. Agitated saline is injected and visualized sonographically to confirm the needle placement in the pericardium.

Pericardiocentesis can be performed using computed tomography (CT) imaging in cases of complex or loculated effusions or when ultrasound has failed to provide proper visualization.

===Blind pericardiocentesis===
Blind pericardiocentesis can be performed in emergency settings when ultrasound is not available and typically utilizes a subxiphoid approach. As the needle is advanced, aspiration is performed to assess for advancement of the needle into the pericardial space. To prevent perforation of the heart, electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring might be used. This involves using an alligator clip to attach an ECG lead to the needle. Changes in ECG waves, such as ST segment elevations or PR depressions, are indicative of contact with the myocardium.

== Risks ==
Fewer than 1.5% of patients experience complications from pericardiocentesis. The most common complications are lacerations of coronary arteries, and puncture of the left ventricle (with associated bleeding from both). Echocardiograms can help to identify complications. Blind approaches are typically only advised in emergencies, and a guided approach is typically preferred (using echocardiography).

<doc id="684789" wikidata="Q1848239" url="?curid=684789" title="Alvíssmál">
<text>Alvíssmál (Old Norse: &#x27;The Song of All-wise&#x27; or &#x27;The Words of All-wise&#x27;) is a poem collected in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, probably dating to the 12th century, that describes how the god Thor outwits a dwarf called Alvíss (&quot;All-Wise&quot;) who seeks to marry his daughter.

==Plot==
Alvíss comes to Thor to claim Thor&#x27;s daughter as his bride, saying that she had been promised to him earlier. Thor refuses as he had not been at home at the time, then tells Alvíss that he may take the young woman if he can correctly answer all of Thor&#x27;s questions. The dwarf&#x27;s replies act as an exhaustive list of the sentient mythological entities among men, Æsir, Vanir, jötnar, dwarfs, and elves. For example, the heavens have the following names, according to Alvíss:

Ultimately, Thor confesses he was asking the questions to gain some time for the sun to rise and turn the dwarf into stone.

==Dating==
It is not known when Alvíssmál was created; analysis of its contents can point to multiple periods depending on which elements are focused upon. One theory is that the use of Thor and references to mythical beings can be assumed to reflect the culture&#x27;s religious beliefs, so it would have been created no later than the 10th century before Iceland was Christianized. Another points to the presence of words found only in late skaldic poetry, which would indicate that it came from the 12th-century skaldic poetry revival.

Two trails run from the state park campground to the mountain&#x27;s summit, one long, the other long. Both are part of the much longer Oregon Coast Trail. The area is popular with hikers, campers, cyclists, and whale watchers although biking and camping on the mountain itself are prohibited.

==Geology==
Humbug Mountain was created about 130 million years ago, in the early Cretaceous period. 
It was formed when islands in the Klamath microcontinent collided, uplifting primordial mountains composed of mostly sandstone. Ancient rivers eroded these mountains, and the sediment and sandstone was deposited on the seashore. Then, the microcontinent collided with the North American continent, uplifting Humbug Mountain in the process. Near the summit, rock outcrops of granite and sandstone can still be found.

The mountain now stands above sea level, and is one of the highest mountains in Oregon to rise directly from the ocean. It is considered a headland.

== History ==
Humbug Mountain was originally known as Me-tus by the indigenous Tututni people. When American settlers located the mountain, they initially named it Sugarloaf Mountain. In 1851 it began to be called Tichenor&#x27;s Humbug when an exploring party sent by Captain William V. Tichenor, founder of Port Orford, got lost and headed north of the port instead of south. Tichenor stated that the name was chosen &quot;to palliate their gross failure.&quot;
Since that time, Tichenor&#x27;s Humbug came to be known as Humbug Mountain. The mountain has also been called Mount Franklin.

In 1934 the Civilian Conservation Corps built the first trail to the summit, however, it was destroyed in the 1962 Columbus Day Storm. An alternate trail was used until the original was reopened in 1993.

==Flora and fauna==

Many types of plants inhabit Humbug Mountain. The most common types of trees include tanoak, Douglas fir, big-leaf maple, Port Orford cedar, and Oregon myrtle. Spruce, alder, and western red cedar can also be found.
Smaller plants such as maidenhair ferns, wild rhododendrons, and vanilla leaf are abundant in the area. Wildflowers such as Columbia lilies, trilliums, and bleeding hearts grow in the spring. Currant, elderberries, blackberries, thimbleberries, huckleberries, and salmonberries are some of the many berries that grow on the mountain.

Birds such as varied thrushes and chickadees live on Humbug Mountain. Douglas squirrels and black-tailed deer are among the numerous mammals that inhabit the mountain.

There are many tide pools in the intertidal zone at the base of the mountain. Organisms such as jellyfish, littleneck clams, sunflower starfish, and many others can be found in these pools.
Gray whales can sometimes be seen migrating along the coast, and more rarely, humpback whales are spotted.

==Trails==

Many trails have been built on Humbug Mountain. The Humbug Mountain Trail climbs to the summit. The trailhead is located in the campground at Humbug Mountain State Park. After going through a tunnel under U.S. Route 101, the trail leads through the old-growth temperate rainforest on the mountain.
It has several switchbacks. The trail then forks about in. The trail to the west was originally built in 1934 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, but was washed out in the Columbus Day Storm of 1962. An alternate trail was built, which now forms a loop with the original trail. The original trail was rebuilt in 1993. Overall, the original trail is approximately long, while the alternate trail is long, for a round trip of . Both trails are part of the much longer Oregon Coast Trail.

Another trail leads from the campground, under the highway, to a long beach on the north side of the mountain.

A fourth trail, named Recreation Trail, follows the path of the Old Coast Highway. It is approximately long, and crosses nearby Brush Creek seventeen times. The trail has many views of the Pacific Ocean. It eventually merges with U.S. Route 101.

==Recreation==
Nature study, wildlife viewing, camping, and whale watching are popular activities around the mountain. Hiking and cycling are also very popular on the trails in the area. Beachcombers, windsurfers, and scuba divers can be found on the beach and in the deep water near the mountain.

Humbug Mountain State Park, which includes all of Humbug Mountain, features a campground with over 100 campsites. The campground is located between Brush Creek and the beach. It has amenities such as showers, flush toilets, a hiker/biker camp, and an amphitheater. There are also picnic tables in the day-use section, south of the main campground.

<doc id="684793" wikidata="Q367423" url="?curid=684793" title="Periosteum">
<text>The periosteum is a membrane that covers the outer surface of all bones, except at the articular surfaces (i.e. the parts within a joint space) of long bones. (At the joints of long bones the bone&#x27;s outer surface is lined with &quot;articular cartilage&quot;, a type of hyaline cartilage.) Endosteum lines the inner surface of the medullary cavity of all long bones.

==Structure==
The periosteum consists of an outer fibrous layer, and an inner &quot;cambium layer&quot; (or osteogenic layer). The fibrous layer is of dense irregular connective tissue, containing fibroblasts, while the cambium layer is highly cellular containing progenitor cells that develop into osteoblasts. These osteoblasts are responsible for increasing the width of a long bone (the length of a long bone is controlled by the epiphyseal plate) and the overall size of the other bone types. After a bone fracture, the progenitor cells develop into osteoblasts and chondroblasts, which are essential to the healing process. The outer fibrous layer and the inner cambium layer are differentiated under electron micrography.

As opposed to osseous tissue, the periosteum has nociceptors, sensory neurons that make it very sensitive to manipulation. It also provides nourishment by providing the blood supply to the body from the marrow. The periosteum is attached to the bone by strong collagen fibres called &quot;Sharpey&#x27;s fibres&quot;, which extend to the outer circumferential and interstitial lamellae. It also provides an attachment for muscles and tendons.

The periosteum that covers the outer surface of the bones of the skull is known as the &quot;pericranium&quot;, except when in reference to the layers of the scalp.

==Etymology==
The word periosteum is derived from the Greek &quot;peri-&quot;, meaning &quot;surrounding&quot;, and &quot;-osteon&quot;, meaning &quot;bone&quot;. The &quot;peri&quot; refers to the fact that the periosteum is the outermost layer of long bones, surrounding other inner layers.

<text>Trachtenberg is a German language name that is also used in other language societies.

== About Trachtenberg as surname ==
(Russian/Ukrainian: Трахтенберг, ; , is a surname of several notable people, typically an Ashkenazi Jewish surname, especially Bessarabian and Ukrainian. Sometimes the name is transliterated to Trachtenburg, whilst Jews from Argentina often spell the name Trajtenberg according to Spanish spelling norms. Some more recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union have had the name transliterated as Trakhtenberg when entering the US.

Trachtenberg, literally &quot;a mountain of costumes&quot; (in German), or &quot;a mountain of thoughts&quot; (in Yiddish), is actually the former German name of a town in Silesia now called by the Polish name Żmigród, where Jews were a significant part of the population until the Second World War and the Holocaust. Jews who bear this name are usually descendants of families who moved from Trachtenburg, Silesia, to another place in central or eastern Europe (and then elsewhere, later on), and became known in their new communities by their former place of residence.

<text>AutoZone Park is a Minor League Baseball stadium located in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, and is home to the Memphis Redbirds of the International League, the Triple-A affiliate of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) St. Louis Cardinals. It previously hosted Memphis 901 FC of the USL Championship, the second tier of U.S. soccer, from 2019 to 2024.

==History==
Designed by Looney Ricks Kiss Architects of Memphis with Kansas City-based HOK Sport (now Populous), AutoZone Park cost $80.5 million to build. This is by far the most money ever spent on a structure dedicated to a minor league baseball team.
AutoZone Park was built to &quot;MLB standards&quot;, but with the absence of outfield seats or food vendors far down the foul lines, making it, for comparison purposes, a major league stadium with only the &#x27;good&#x27; seats&quot;. It opened in 2000, replacing Tim McCarver Stadium. The stadium also hosts some games for the University of Memphis baseball team, and most notably, the annual game with Ole Miss.

The Redbirds had been unique in baseball until recently, in that they were owned by a non-profit community foundation, the Memphis Redbirds Foundation; the Green Bay Packers of the NFL have a similar ownership structure. However, the Foundation defaulted on its bond payment in 2010. On November 15, 2013, the Foundation announced that the default would be remedied by the St. Louis Cardinals paying off the bonds at a discount and acquiring the Redbirds, while the city of Memphis resumes ownership of the stadium.

The stadium hosted the 2003 Triple-A All-Star Game in which the International League All-Stars defeated the Pacific Coast League All-Stars, 13–9.

In October 2004 and 2005 AutoZone Park was home to the Greater Mid-South Jaycees Field of Screams Haunted House.

In October 2005, AutoZone Park became the first venue outside of New Orleans to host the Voodoo Music Experience. One day of this music festival was moved to Memphis due to Hurricane Katrina.

On December 4, 2006, at the Major League Baseball Winter Meetings, MLB announced that an exhibition game to be called the Civil Rights Game would be held at AutoZone Park, with the first game on March 31, 2007. The game featured the Cardinals and the Cleveland Indians, with the Cardinals winning, 5–1. The second game was played on March 29, 2008, between the Chicago White Sox and the New York Mets. The Mets defeated the White Sox, 3–2.

On August 31, 2008, the ballpark&#x27;s largest crowd to date witnessed the Redbirds lose to the Oklahoma RedHawks, 10–7, in front of 18,620 fans.

AutoZone Park was the site of the 2016 Triple-A National Championship Game in which the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders, champions of the International League, defeated the PCL-champion El Paso Chihuahuas, 3–1, before a crowd of 9,471 people on September 20. The stadium once again hosted the championship game on September 17, 2019, in which the PCL&#x27;s Sacramento River Cats defeated the Columbus Clippers, 4–0, with 9,123 on hand.

===Soccer===

Memphis 901 FC, a USL Championship soccer team, played at AutoZone Park from 2019 to 2024. They made their league debut at the stadium on March 9, 2019, and lost 1–0 to the Tampa Bay Rowdies in front of a sellout crowd of 8,062. It was the first professional soccer match played in Memphis since 1994. For soccer matches, the infield was covered with sod and a pitch was laid along the first base line. The pitcher&#x27;s mound was initially leveled and covered; plans to install a retractable mound for easier conversions were also discussed. The team announced plans to build their own soccer-specific stadium in late 2022 at the site of the Mid-South Coliseum; the new stadium was projected to open in 2025. After the funding fell through, the team&#x27;s owners transferred franchise rights to Santa Barbara, California.

==Size==
AutoZone Park has a seating capacity of 10,000, and has been aptly described as &quot;one-third&quot; of a major league baseball park.

For its construction of concrete were used, or enough to cover . There are of brick walls surrounding it, utilizing 380,000 specially manufactured bricks. It holds of steel and of electrical wiring. To build the playing field, of clay, and of sand were needed. The outfield contains of sod. The infield is capable of draining of rain per hour. while remaining playable, which means that the field only rarely has to be covered during games.

AutoZone Park also has one of the largest video screens in minor league baseball. It is located above the play field, giving a view of the board to many areas of downtown Memphis. On January 10, 2012 the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; reported that the Redbirds planned to install a full HD video display, replacing the old video screen. The new video board will be the largest in Minor League Baseball.

==Amenities==
AutoZone Park contains several special seating sections designed to give patrons a variety of viewing options.

*The Family Leisure Picnic Pavilion is located on the east of the park, and contains several picnic tables and space for vending food. It is commonly used for special event hosting, and can seat up to 500 people.
*The Bluffs, located in each corner of the park has grass covered lawn seating, and tickets to this area are sold cheaply, but in limited numbers. It is a favorite spot for many fans because of the picnic atmosphere. Chairs are not allowed on the Bluff.
*The upper club levels contain 700 seats in 48 suites, and are generally reserved to groups or local companies. Many larger Memphis companies retain one suite for the entire season, for all games.
*The normal club seating have access to an air conditioned concourse, along with several restaurants and bars located on the concourse itself.
*In total, the ballpark has 1,600 club seats.
*There are two open-air party decks, each of which seats up to 175 people, and three pre-game balconies.

==Attendance records==
AutoZone Park&#x27;s single-game attendance record was set on August 31, 2008, for a game between the Redbirds and the Oklahoma RedHawks in front of a sellout crowd of 18,620 people. The park&#x27;s season attendance record of 887,976 and average attendance record of 12,507 were both set in 2001. Attendance records through the completion of the 2019 season are as follows.

<text>The Fur (Fur: &quot;fòòrà&quot;, Arabic: فور &quot;Fūr&quot;) are an ethnic group predominantly inhabiting Darfur, the western part of Sudan, where they are the largest ethnic group. They speak the Fur language, which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family.

==Overview==
The Fur are the largest ethnic group in the Darfur region of western Sudan. They are also sometimes referred to by the names Fora, Fordunga, Furawi, Konjara, or Kungara. They are an active agricultural people and may also herd cattle. Some Fur families who have accumulated a substantial cattle herd developed a more nomadic lifestyle like that of their herding neighbors, the Baqqara (Baggara) Arabs. Culturally, those cattle-herding Fur are now considered to be Baqqara. The Fur are nominally Sunni Muslims following the Maliki school of Islamic law.

They are a Western Sudanese people who practice sedentary herding and agriculture, mainly the cultivation of millet. Their society is a traditional one governed by village elders. They speak Fur, a Nilo-Saharan language, and are Muslims, having adopted the religion following the region&#x27;s conquest by the Kanem-Bornu Empire during the Middle Ages. Some of them have come to speak Arabic in recent years.

The name of Darfur comes from the name of this ethnic group and means &quot;the home of the Fur&quot;. Most of the well known governors of Darfur such as Deriage and Tegani Seisei are members of the Fur. The Fur established the historical Sultanate of Darfur which governed Darfur until 1916 (see History of Darfur).
Abdul Wahid al Nur, a leader among the Fur, established the Sudan Liberation Movement and Army. Another leader of the Fur, , is Ahmed Abdelshafi (Toba).

The traditional heartland of the Fur is the mountainous region around Jebel Sî and Jebel Marra Wadi Salih and Zaligi; today, however, most of them live in the lower country west and southwest of that area, between 11–14 N and 23–26 E. Some Fur live across the border in Chad, many of them refugees.

The Furs&#x27; lifestyle has led to conflict with the nomadic Baggara, cattle-herders of the region, concerning access to water and grazing land, particularly in Darfur&#x27;s central Jebel Marra mountains where the best agricultural land is to be found. This has been the source of ethnic tensions for many years, culminating in the Darfur conflict which began in 2003.

Many Fur villagers were massacred in the ethnic fighting as and Terjem tribes divided up land they conquered from the Fur, according to a 3 September 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; account citing United Nations officials and Fur survivors.

==Language==

The Fur speak the Fur language, which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan family. They also speak Arabic as a lingua franca.

There is no written or symbolic script for the Fur language. They recently have been using Arabic or Latin characters to put the language in written form. Most Fur people speak Fur fluently as their mother tongue.

Heavy drums are often used while making speeches and other public addresses.

==Art==

===Handmade art===
The Fur people make their own handmade art and utensils. These include &quot;talak&quot;, which is used for cleaning pots (&quot;talak&quot; looks like a sponge); &quot;birish&quot;, which is a carpet for sitting; and &quot;gada&quot;, which is a wood plate or bowl used for important occasions.

===Music, stories and entertainment===
Among the Fur people, stories are told to keep children safe from the outside world. These stories are designed to keep children close to home. In some stories children are told that if they go out in the morning they will die from the heat of the sun, and in the night they are told if they go out an animal called &quot;nyama&quot; will eat them.

Fur music is very popular in their culture. The main instruments are drums. The music is played with a heavy drumbeat that accompanies their celebrations. Some popular Fur musicians are; Abdalla Kioka, Marium Amo and Tour Baréé&#x27;ng Kwee.

===Architecture===
A common type of architecture in homes and buildings is called mud architecture. They dig the clay from the ground, break it up, mix it with water, work thoroughly, and also mix other substances like straw. The clay will then pile up while still wet, pressed on to the scaffolds made out of wood, or cast in molds of various sizes into bricks. When the mud dries up in the molded shape, the process is complete. This technique is applied to most architecture in Western Sudan such as farmhouses, barns, outer walls, palaces, and even mosques. Mud is good at absorbing heat, which is advantageous for cold nights. However, because of its low resistance to wind and rain, there is a constant need to repair buildings. Therefore, the mud architecture is no longer practical because of its fragility, as well as cultural changes and foreign influences.

===Attire and body art===
Clothes among the Fur people are similar to what is worn in Sudan. They wear casual Sudanese clothes like a jalabiya. The jalabiya is a white garment that covers the wearer from head to toe. A long time ago, when the Fur tribe was Arabised, Fur women used to poke their lower lip many times until the lip starts to swell. These dents were considered a sign of beauty.

==Social structure==

In the social structure of the Fur people, they do not have so much regard for their wealth. A poor leader and a rich leader can become a chief. The experience of a man is based primarily on his knowledge of the Quran. A man cannot even get married if he does not know a couple pages of this text.

The Quran is studied with the help of a hand-held board shaped object known as the lohh and a wooden stylus called a kalam. The Fur tribesman&#x27;s knowledge of the Quran determines their position on the tribe&#x27;s hierarchy ladder. For example, a tribesman must know almost the whole book to attain position as chieftain.

The Fur people also have their own crafts for entertainment. These include dance-games like &quot;ALLE&quot; (all-eh) and toys like Burajei. Burajei is a small doll-like toy made from a camel&#x27;s back. It is bound by rope and sewn by thorns.

==Social behavior==

When greeting each other, a woman and a man have different forms of respect. The woman must kneel down before the man and the man must slow his pace. Different sexes can also dance together but are forbidden to touch or live with each other unless they are family.

Men and women usually get married in their late teens to their early twenties. The groom and wife will meet each other and get to know about them, their accomplishments and other important attributes. If everything goes well they will proceed to wed.

===Roles of men and women===

The men bear the family name. They work to bring money to the family and are responsible for all important decisions related to the family, such as finances and marriages. The women get water, prepare the food and ensure the cleanliness of the home.

Daughters normally help their mothers, milk the cows and stay at home. Sons rear and herd cattle along with the domesticated cows. If either of these two misbehave they are similarly punished by their elders. Also, it is disrespectful to look an adult in the eyes.

===Eating===

Sudan is well known for its Guhwah coffee served from a &quot;jebena&quot;, a special Sudanese pot. The coffee beans are roasted in this pot over charcoal, then ground with cloves and other spices. The grounds are steeped in hot water and the coffee is served in tiny cups after straining it through a grass sieve.

Tea or &quot;chai&quot; is also very popular and served in small glasses without milk. Some beverages enjoyed in the non-Islamic areas are Aragi, a clear strong spirit made from dates, merissa, a type of beer and tedj, or wines, made from dates or honey. 
Sudanese cuisine is as varied as its cultures, especially in the south, but it has certain unique characteristics. Millet porridge and fool medamas, a savory dish of mashed fava beans, are popular breakfast foods in the north. Lamb and chicken are often eaten, but pork is prohibited to Muslims.

Wheat and dura sorghum are the staple starches. Breads include the Arabian khubz, and kisra, an omelet-like pancake which is part of the Sudanese dinner. Maschi, a beef and tomato dish, is also typical. Fruits are peeled for dessert and a favorite treat is creme caramel.

In the south, dinner is served on a low, bare table. There may be five or six dishes to dip into with large pieces of flatbread. These dishes are accompanied by a salad and shata, a red-hot spice mixture served in small dishes. After the meal, dessert is served, then tea. On special occasions incense may be lit. The ritual of hospitality is important in Sudan.

==Economic base==

The Fur people have many types of families. Porundia, or nuclear families, are a very common type. They normally have 2 or more children. In a typical Fur family the parents of the groom and wife will be taken care of until they die.

In a Fur marriage, the groom&#x27;s father goes to the bride&#x27;s father and asks for his son&#x27;s permission to marry. The bride&#x27;s father does not give an answer immediately, but then asks the village for its opinion. If everyone approves, the bride&#x27;s father accepts. The whole village gathers for the announcement of the marriage, and preparations are made. Then the marriage starts in the groom&#x27;s house. The Imam recites words from the Quran. The groom and bride hold hands during this time. After the wedding, the family and guests have lunch, then they start a lively dance called firalubia. Then the bride and groom are taken to the bride&#x27;s house and given food during which everyone says congratulations (&quot;mabrouk&quot; in Arabic).

==Institutions==

Islam is the major religion among the Fur people, although some still practice their own religion. The schools called (Kalwa) in this region teach the Quran. Classes begin at 6–7 years and they continue learning the Quran (though not entirely in school) for the rest of their lives. Normal schooling is also practiced in these schools.

The main occupation here is farming. The Fur people are excellent farmers. They grow and harvest wheat, herbs, spices, etc. Wealth is not really important for the Fur people. Only his knowledge of the Quran determines his altitude.

==History==

The Fur people came from Central Africa, specifically the Central African Republic and Chad to the northwest of Sudan, where they settled in Darfur. They had 36 sultanates. The Fur were also one of the first people from other ethnic groups in the country who were picked to build the wall covering and mosque surrounding the Kaaba. Moreover, they managed to send conveys informs of aid every year to Makkah.

===Political situation===

Until 1916, the Fur were ruled by an independent sultanate and were oriented politically to peoples in Chad. Though the ruling dynasty before that time, as well as the common people, had long been Muslims, they have not been Arabized. They are now incorporated into the Sudan political system. The Fur had been basically independent from the 17th century. After British reconquest in 1899, the British approved the re-establishment of the Fur Sultanate, assumed by Ali Dinar when the Mahdist movement crumbled.

Mahdist revolts continued to break out in Sudan until 1916. The fall of Darfur was decided when Ali Dinar declared loyalty to the Ottoman Empire in World War I. The British abolished the Fur Sultanate in 1916 after Dinar died in battle.

In World War I Darfur made a bid for independence by allying with Turkey against the British. The British conquered Darfur in 1916, and since then it has been part of Sudan. Since the 1970s, the Darfur area has suffered some of the effects of the northern Arab war prosecuted in the south against Southern ethnic groups who wanted to secede from the Sudan.

War has been the primary factor in the last few decades of the Darfur area. A civil war lasted about 20 years until the end of the 20th Century. A new conflict arose in 2003, involving local Arab militia called Janjaweed attacking the African peoples village by village in a campaign of terror, reportedly supported by the Sudanese military.

==Genetics==
Analysis of classic genetic markers and DNA polymorphisms by Tay and Saha (1988) found that the Fur are most closely related to the Hawazma of Sudan. Both populations have gene frequencies intermediate between those of the Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja, Gaalin and Gulf Arab populations and those of the local Nilo-Saharan-speaking Nuba and Nilotes.

According to Hassan et al. (2008), around 59.4% of Fur are carriers of the E1b1b paternal haplogroup. Of these, 68.4% bear the V32 subclade. Approximately 6.3% also belong to the haplogroup J1. This points to significant patrilineal gene flow from neighboring Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations. The remaining Fur individuals are primarily carriers of the A3b2 lineage (31.3%), which is instead common among Nilotes.

Maternally, the Fur entirely belong to African-based derivatives of the macrohaplogroup L according to Hassan (2010). Of these mtDNA clades, the L0a1 (15.3%) and L1c (11.5%) lineages are most frequent. This altogether suggests that the genetic introgression into the Fur&#x27;s ancestral population was asymmetrical, occurring primarily through Afro-Asiatic-speaking males rather than females.

<text>Andy Clark, (born 1957) is a British philosopher who is Professor of Cognitive Philosophy at the University of Sussex. Prior to this, he was a professor of philosophy and Chair in Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, director of the Cognitive Science Program at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and previously taught at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. Clark is one of the founding members of the CONTACT collaborative research project whose aim is to investigate the role environment plays in shaping the nature of conscious experience. Clark&#x27;s papers and books deal with the philosophy of mind and he is considered a leading scholar on the subject of mind extension. He has also written extensively on connectionism, robotics and the role and nature of mental representation.

== Philosophical work ==
Clark&#x27;s work explores a number of disparate but interrelated themes. Many of these themes run against established wisdom in cognitive processing and representation. According to traditional computational accounts, the function of the mind is understood as the process of creating, storing, and updating internal representations of the world, on the basis of which other processes and actions may take place. Representations are updated to correspond with an environment in accordance with the function, goal-state, or desire of the system in question at any given time. Thus, for example, learning a new route through a maze-like building would be mirrored in a change in the representation of that building. Action, on this view, is the outcome of a process that determines the best way to achieve the goal-state or desire, based on current representations. Such a determinative process may be the purview of a Cartesian &quot;central executive&quot; or a distributed process like homuncular decomposition.

In contrast to traditional models of cognition, which often posit the one-way flow of sensory information from the periphery towards more remote areas of the brain, Clark has suggested a two-way &quot;cascade of cortical processing&quot; underlying perception, action, and learning. The concept of predictive processing lies at the heart of this view, wherein top-down predictions attempt to correctly guess or &quot;explain away&quot; bottom-up sensory information in an iterative, hierarchical manner. Discrepancies between the expected signal and actual signal, in essence, the &quot;prediction error,&quot; travel upward to help refine the accuracy of future predictions. Interactions between forward flow of error (conveyed by &quot;error units&quot;) and backward flow of prediction are dynamic, with attention playing a key role in weighting the relative influence of either at each level of the cascade (dopamine is mentioned as &quot;one possible mechanism for encoding precision&quot; with regard to error units). Action (or action-oriented predictive processing) also plays an important role in Clark&#x27;s account as another means by which the brain can reduce prediction error by directly influencing the environment. To this, he adds that &quot;personal, affective, and hedonic&quot; factors would be implicated along with the minimization of prediction error, creating a more nuanced model for the relationship between action and perception.

According to Clark, the computational model, which forms the philosophical foundation of artificial intelligence, engenders several intractable problems. One of the more salient is an information bottleneck: if, in order to determine appropriate actions, it is the job of the mind to construct detailed inner representations of the external world, then, as the world is constantly changing, the demands on the mental system will almost certainly preclude any action taking place. For Clark, we need relatively little information about the world before we may act effectively upon it. We tend to be susceptible to &quot;grand illusion&quot;, where our impressions of a richly detailed world obscure a reality of minimal environmental information and quick action. We needn&#x27;t try to reconstruct the detail of this world, as it is able to serve as its own best model from which to extract information &quot;just in time&quot;.

Clark&#x27;s writings also focus on the concept of transhumanism, most prevalent in his work, &quot;Natural-Born Cyborgs&quot; which explores the progressing incorporation of human biology and technological implants. Through a series of contemporary technological studies and an evaluation of the cyborg figure in pop-culture, Clark maps out a perception of the cyborg as a reality. This is not necessarily to show what humanity is to become from biologically implanted technology, but rather to explore where humanity is now with said technology. In his own words, humans are &quot;creatures whose minds are special precisely because they are tailor-made for multiple mergers and coalitions.&quot; He elaborates this as he describes his body as an &quot;electronic virgin&quot; untouched by technology, but gradually over time technology will become intertwined with his biology. Whether that incorporation will be as mundane as the use of eyeglasses or something more advanced such as a new auditory prosthesis, he believes the merger of technology and biology is inevitable and present.

=== Extended mind thesis ===

Clark is perhaps most well known for his work on the extended mind thesis, which says that the mind extends into the environment. Clark spoke about his thesis in TEDxLambeth 2019.

==Personal life==
Clark lives in Brighton, England, with his partner, Alexa Morcom, a cognitive neuroscientist. He has a tattoo of a comic book styled, undersea theme.

<text>Don Craig Wiley (October 21, 1944 – November 15, 2001) was an American structural biologist.

==Education==
Wiley received his doctoral degree in biophysics in 1971 from Harvard University, where he worked under the direction of the subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr.
There, Wiley did early work on the structure of aspartate carbamoyltransferase, the largest molecular structure determined at that time. Noteworthy in this effort was that Wiley managed to grow crystals of aspartate carbamoyltransferase suitable for obtaining its X-ray structure, a particularly difficult task in the case of this molecular complex.

==Career and research==
Wiley was world-renowned for finding new ways to help the human immune system battle such viral scourges as smallpox, influenza, HIV/AIDS and herpes simplex.

Famous quote: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, but I just don&#x27;t understand anything in biology unless I know what it looks like.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 1990, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. His research was honored with the 1993 Cancer Research Institute William B. Coley Award. Harvard called Wiley &quot;one of the most influential biologists of his generation.&quot; In 1999, Wiley and another Harvard professor, Jack L. Strominger, won the Japan Prize for their discoveries of how the immune system protects humans from infections.

==Personal life==
Wiley owned a British racing green-colored Aston Martin.

He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Disappearance and death==
Wiley disappeared on November 15, 2001. The official coroner&#x27;s report stated that Wiley died after falling off a bridge near Memphis, Tennessee; his body was found in the Mississippi River downstream in Vidalia, Louisiana a month later and his death was ruled to be an accident. Shelby County Medical Examiner, Dr. O. C. Smith, conducted the investigation into Wiley&#x27;s death. Smith was quoted by a Boston Magazine article by Doug Most, which states: &quot;Of all the measurements Smith took, one stood out: 8 inches. That&#x27;s how narrow the curb is from the road to the railing, which is only 43 inches high. &#x27;If he stood against the rail, it&#x27;s hitting him in the back of the thigh,&#x27; Smith says. &#x27;If he&#x27;s startled or caught by a gust from an 18-wheeler, his center of gravity is 47 inches, near the top rail, below his hip.&#x27;&quot; A 43&quot; rail hitting a person in the back of the thigh would require a person to have an inseam of 41–44 inches. An inseam of 40 inches is recommended for persons 6&#x27; 11&quot; to over 7&#x27; tall.

Wiley was 6&#x27;3&quot; and weighed 160 pounds, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, for each tournament the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second.

A ranking list for the 1983–84 snooker season was issued by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) following the 1983 World Snooker Championship. Players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1981, 1982 and 1983) contributed to their points total. For 1981 and 1982, the World Champion gained five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, losing quarter-finalists got two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point, while for 1983 the points were double this. For the first time, tournaments other than world championship were taken into account, with the 1982 International Open and 1982 Professional Players Tournament both at the same points tariff as the 1981 and 1982 World Championships. Players with no ranking points were ranked on the basis of their performance in the 1983 World Championship. A revised ranking list was issued following a vote by the WPBSA board to amend the rules so that players without any ranking points, which were those ranked lower than 28th, would receive one &quot;merit&quot; point if they had reached the last-32 of the World Championships in scope and half a merit point if they had reached the last 32 of the 1982 International Open or the second round of the 1982 Professional Players Tournament.

Steve Davis was the top-ranked player for the first time, displacing Ray Reardon who moved to second place. Cliff Thorburn retained third place from the previous year, and Tony Knowles rose from fifteenth up to fourth. Perrie Mans and Willie Thorne both dropped out of the top sixteen, which meant they would need to enter the qualifying rounds of the 1984 World Snooker Championship rather than be seeded into the main event. Tony Meo and John Virgo moved into the top 16.

In her book &quot;Cruel Game: The Inside Story of Snooker&quot;, published in April 1983, Jean Rafferty wrote that &quot;The world rankings are calculated with such little regard for the synchronisation of achievement and reward that they must be seen as creative rather than informative.&quot;

==Rankings==
The rankings including players with merit points (which are indicated with a symbol) are shown below. In the original list there were 32 players; Mike Hallett was 29th, followed by Eugene Hughes, Les Dodd and John Campbell.

<text>A hematoma, also spelled haematoma, or blood suffusion is a localized bleeding outside of blood vessels, due to either disease or trauma including injury or surgery and may involve blood continuing to seep from broken capillaries. A hematoma is benign and is initially in liquid form spread among the tissues including in sacs between tissues where it may coagulate and solidify before blood is reabsorbed into blood vessels. An ecchymosis is a hematoma of the skin larger than 10 mm.

They may occur among and or within many areas such as skin and other organs, connective tissues, bone, joints and muscle.

A collection of blood (or even a hemorrhage) may be aggravated by anticoagulant medication (blood thinner). Blood seepage and collection of blood may occur if heparin is given via an intramuscular route; to avoid this, heparin must be given intravenously or subcutaneously.

==Signs and symptoms==

Some hematomas are visible under the surface of the skin (commonly called bruises) or possibly felt as masses or lumps. Lumps may be caused by the limitation of the blood to a sac, subcutaneous or intramuscular tissue space isolated by fascial planes. This is a key anatomical feature that helps prevent injuries from causing massive blood loss. In most cases a hematoma as a sac of blood eventually dissolves; however, in some cases it may continue to grow due to blood seepage or show no change. If the sac of blood does not disappear, then it may need to be surgically cleaned out or repaired.

The slow process of reabsorption of hematomas can allow the broken down blood cells and hemoglobin pigment to move in the connective tissue. For example, a patient who injures the base of their thumb might cause a hematoma, which will slowly move all through their finger within a week. Gravity is the main determinant of this process.

Hematomas on articulations can reduce mobility of a member and present roughly the same symptoms as a fracture.

In most cases, movement and exercise of the affected muscle is the best way to introduce the collection back into the bloodstream.

A misdiagnosis of a hematoma in the vertebra can sometimes occur; this is correctly called a hemangioma (buildup of cells) or a benign tumor.

==Classification==

===Types===

*Subdermal hematoma (under the skin)
*Intramuscular hematoma (inside muscle tissue)
*Skull/brain:
**Subgaleal hematoma – between the galea aponeurosis and periosteum
**Cephalohematoma – between the periosteum and skull. Commonly caused by vacuum delivery and vertex delivery.
**Epidural hematoma – between the skull and dura mater
**Subdural hematoma – between the dura mater and arachnoid mater
**Subarachnoid hematoma – between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (the subarachnoid space)
**Othematoma – between the skin and the layers of cartilage of the ear
*Breast hematoma (breast)
*Perichondral hematoma (ear)
*Perianal hematoma (anus)
*Subungual hematoma (nail)
*Rectus sheath hematoma

===Degrees===
*Petechiae – small pinpoint hematomas less than 3 mm in diameter
*Purpura (purple) – a bruise about 3–5 mm in diameter, generally round in shape
*Ecchymosis – subcutaneous extravasation of blood in a thin layer under the skin, i.e. bruising or &quot;black and blue&quot;, over 1 cm in diameter

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;hematoma&quot; came into use in 1826. The word derives from the Greek αἷμα &quot;haima&quot; &quot;blood&quot; and -ωμα &quot;-oma&quot;, a suffix forming nouns indicating a mass or tumor.

<doc id="684813" wikidata="Q856670" url="?curid=684813" title="1973 Chilean coup d'état">
<text>The 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état () was a military overthrow of the democratic socialist president of Chile Salvador Allende and his Popular Unity coalition government. Allende, who has been described as the first Marxist to be democratically elected president in a Latin American liberal democracy, faced significant social unrest, political tension with the opposition-controlled National Congress of Chile. On 11 September 1973, a group of military officers, led by General Augusto Pinochet, seized power in a coup, ending civilian rule.

Following the coup, a military junta was established, and suspended all political activities in Chile and suppressed left-wing movements, such as the Communist Party of Chile and the Socialist Party of Chile, the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), and other communist and socialist parties. Pinochet swiftly consolidated power and was officially declared president of Chile in late 1974. The Nixon administration, which had played a role in creating favorable conditions for the coup, promptly recognized the junta government and supported its efforts to consolidate power.

Due to the coup&#x27;s coincidental occurrence on the same date as the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, it has sometimes been referred to as &quot;the other 9/11&quot;.

In 2023, declassified documents showed that Nixon, Henry Kissinger, and the United States government, which had described Allende as a dangerous communist, were aware of the military&#x27;s plans to overthrow Allende in the days before the coup d&#x27;état. There is no documentary evidence to support that the United States Government acted actively in the coordination and execution of the coup actions by the Chilean Armed Forces, however, Richard Nixon&#x27;s interest from the beginning was that the Allende government would not be consolidated.

During the air raids and ground attacks preceding the coup, Allende delivered his final speech, expressing his determination to remain at Palacio de La Moneda and rejecting offers of safe passage for exile. Although he died in the palace, the exact circumstances of Allende&#x27;s death are still disputed, but it is generally accepted as a suicide.

Chile had previously been regarded as a symbol of democracy and political stability in South America, while other countries in the region suffered under military juntas and &quot;caudillismo&quot;; the Chilean period prior to the coup is known as the Presidential Republic (1925–1973) era. At the time, Chile was a middle-class country, with about 30% or 9 million Chileans being middle class. The collapse of Chilean democracy marked the end of a series of democratic governments that had held elections since 1932.

Historian Peter Winn described the 1973 coup as one of the most violent events in Chilean history. The coup led to a series of human rights abuses in Chile under Pinochet, who initiated a brutal and long-lasting campaign of political suppression through torture, murder, and exile, which significantly weakened leftist opposition to the military dictatorship of Chile (1973–1990). Nonetheless, Pinochet stepped down from power voluntarily after the internationally supported 1989 Chilean constitutional referendum held under the military junta led to the peaceful Chilean transition to democracy.

==Political background==

Allende contested the 1970 Chilean presidential election with Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez of the National Party and Radomiro Tomic of the Christian Democratic Party. Allende received 36.6% of the vote, while Alessandri was a very close second with 35.3%, and Tomic third with 28.1%, in what was a close three-way election. Although Allende received the highest number of votes, according to the Chilean constitution and since none of the candidates won by an absolute majority, the National Congress had to decide among the candidates.

The Chilean Constitution of 1925 did not allow a person to be president for consecutive terms. The incumbent president, Eduardo Frei Montalva, was therefore ineligible as a candidate. The CIA&#x27;s &quot;Track I&quot; operation was a plan to influence the Congress to choose Alessandri, who would resign after a short time in office, forcing a second election. Frei would then be eligible to run. Alessandri announced on 9 September that if Congress chose him, he would resign. Allende signed a Statute of Constitutional Guarantees, which stated that he would follow the constitution during his presidency trying to shore up support for his candidacy. Congress then decided on Allende. The U.S. feared the example of a &quot;well-functioning socialist experiment&quot; in the region and exerted diplomatic, economic, and covert pressure upon Chile&#x27;s elected socialist government. At the end of 1971, the Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro made a four-week state visit to Chile, alarming American observers worried about the &quot;Chilean Way to Socialism&quot;.

Allende presided over an increasingly unstable economy. A fiscal deficit of 3.5% in 1970 grew to 24% by 1973. In 1972, Economics Minister Pedro Vuskovic adopted monetary policies that increased the amount of circulating currency and devalued the escudo. That year, inflation increased by 225% and reached 606% by 1973. The high inflation in 1973 decreased wages by 38%. To combat this, Allende created the Committees of Supplies and Prices (Juntas de Abastecimiento y Precios (JAP)). JAP reopened private shops and requisitioned goods which had been slowly disappearing due to drops in production.

In October 1972, Chile suffered the first of many strikes. The Trucker&#x27;s Strike that began on 1 October in the Ayse providence was a response to economic problems and rumors that transportation would be nationalized. Eight days later, the Confederation of Truckers, led by Leon Vilarín with the support of the guilds and possibly the CIA, called for an indefinite national strike, which inhibited the movement and distribution of goods that had already been struggling. Truckers then blocked all main roads on 12 October, creating a shortage of essential goods. Allende declared a state of emergency in response and the strike leaders were arrested. This would only provoke the Chilean population further and more strikes and protests ensued. The state of emergency also failed to reverse the strike or the economic crisis.

Among the participants were small-scale businessmen, some professional unions, and student groups. Its leaders – Vilarín, Jaime Guzmán, Rafael Cumsille, Guillermo Elton, Eduardo Arriagada – expected to depose the elected government. Other than damaging the national economy, the principal effect of the 24-day strike was drawing Army head, General Carlos Prats, into the government as Interior Minister, an appeasement to the right wing. This replaced General René Schneider, who had been assassinated (Schneider had been shot on 22 October 1970 by a group led by General Roberto Viaux, whom the Central Intelligence Agency had not attempted to discourage, and died three days later.) General Prats supported the legalist Schneider Doctrine and refused military involvement in a coup d&#x27;état against President Allende.

Despite the declining economy, President Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity coalition increased its vote to 43.2% in the March 1973 parliamentary elections; but, by then, the informal alliance between Popular Unity and the Christian Democrats ended. The Christian Democrats allied with the right-wing National Party, who were opposed to Allende&#x27;s government; the two right-wing parties formed the Confederation of Democracy (CODE). The internecine parliamentary conflict between the legislature and the executive branch paralyzed the activities of government.

Allende began to fear his opponents, convinced they were plotting his assassination. Using his daughter Beatriz as a messenger, he explained the situation to Fidel Castro. Castro gave four pieces of advice: convince technicians to stay in Chile, sell only copper for US dollars, do not engage in extreme revolutionary acts which would give opponents an excuse to wreck or seize control of the economy, and maintain a proper relationship with the Chilean military until local militias could be established and consolidated. Allende attempted to follow Castro&#x27;s advice, but the latter two recommendations proved difficult.

===Chilean military prior to the coup===
Prior to the coup, the Chilean military had undergone a process of de-politicization since the 1920s, when military officers had held cabinet positions. Subsequently, most military officers remained under-funded, having only subsistence salaries. Because of the low salaries, the military spent much time in military leisure-time facilities (e.g., country clubs) where they met other officers and their families. The military remained apart from society and was to some degree an endogamous group as officers frequently married the sisters of their comrades or the daughters of high-ranked older officers. Many officers also had relatives in the military. In 1969, elements of the military made their first act of rebellion in 40 years when they participated in the Tacnazo insurrection. The Tacnazo was not a proper coup, but a protest against under-funding. In retrospect General Carlos Prats considered that Christian Democrats who were in power in 1969 committed the error of not taking the military&#x27;s grievances seriously.

Throughout the 1960s, the governments of Ecuador (1963), Brazil (1964), Argentina (1966), Peru (1968), and Bolivia (1969) were overthrown and replaced by military governments. In June 1973, Uruguay joined the coup d&#x27;état wave that swept through the region. The poor conditions of the Chilean military contrasted with the change of fortune the military of neighboring countries experienced as they came to power in coups.

During the decades prior to the coup, the military became influenced by the United States&#x27; anti-communist ideology in the context of various cooperation programs, including the U.S. Army School of the Americas.

==Crisis==
On 29 June 1973, Colonel Roberto Souper surrounded La Moneda presidential palace with his tank regiment and failed to depose the Allende Government. That failed &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; – known as the &quot;Tanquetazo&quot; tank putsch – had been organized by the nationalist &quot;Fatherland and Liberty&quot; paramilitary group.

In August 1973, a constitutional crisis occurred; the Supreme Court publicly complained about the government&#x27;s inability to enforce the law of the land. On 22 August, the Christian Democrats united with the National Party of the Chamber of Deputies accused the government of unconstitutional acts and called upon the military to enforce constitutional order.

For months, the government had feared calling upon the &quot;Carabineros&quot; national police, suspecting them of disloyalty. On 9 August, Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defense. He was forced to resign both as defense minister and as the Army commander-in-chief on 24 August 1973, embarrassed by the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest of the wives of his generals at his house. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day. In late August 1973, 100,000 Chilean women congregated at Plaza de la Constitución to protest against the government for the rising cost and increasing shortages of food and fuels, but they were dispersed with tear gas.

===Resolution by the Chamber of Deputies===
On 23 August 1973, with the support of the Christian Democrats and National Party members, the Chamber of Deputies passed 81–47 a resolution that asked &quot;the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces&quot; to &quot;put an immediate end&quot; to &quot;breach[es of] the Constitution ... with the goal of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law and ensuring the Constitutional order of our Nation, and the essential underpinnings of democratic co-existence among Chileans&quot;.

The resolution declared that the Allende government sought &quot;to conquer absolute power with the obvious purpose of subjecting all citizens to the strictest political and economic control by the state ... [with] the goal of establishing a totalitarian system&quot;, claiming it had made &quot;violations of the Constitution ... a permanent system of conduct&quot;. Essentially, most of the accusations were about the government disregarding the separation of powers, and arrogating legislative and judicial prerogatives to the executive branch of government. Finally, the resolution condemned the &quot;creation and development of government-protected armed groups, which ... are headed towards a confrontation with the armed forces&quot;. President Allende&#x27;s efforts to re-organize the military and the police forces were characterised as &quot;notorious attempts to use the armed and police forces for partisan ends, destroy their institutional hierarchy, and politically infiltrate their ranks&quot;.

It can be argued that the resolution called upon the armed forces to overthrow the government if it did not comply, as follows: &quot;To present the President of the Republic, Ministers of State, and members of the Armed and Police Forces with the grave breakdown of the legal and constitutional order ... it is their duty to put an immediate end to all situations herein referred to that breach the Constitution and the laws of the land with the aim of redirecting government activity toward the path of Law&quot;. The resolution was later used by Pinochet a way to justify the coup, which occurred two weeks later.

===Salvador Allende&#x27;s response===
On 24 August 1973, two days after the resolution, Allende responded. He accused the opposition of trying to incite a military coup by encouraging the armed forces to disobey civilian authorities. He described the Congress&#x27;s declaration as &quot;destined to damage the country&#x27;s prestige abroad and create internal confusion&quot;, and predicted: &quot;It will facilitate the seditious intention of certain sectors.&quot; He observed that the declaration (passed 81–47 in the Chamber of Deputies) had not obtained the two-thirds Senate majority &quot;constitutionally required&quot; to convict the president of abuse of power, thus the Congress was &quot;invoking the intervention of the armed forces and of Order against a democratically elected government&quot; and &quot;subordinat[ing] political representation of national sovereignty to the armed institutions, which neither can nor ought to assume either political functions or the representation of the popular will.&quot;

Allende argued that he had obeyed constitutional means for including military men to the cabinet at the service of civic peace and national security, defending republican institutions against insurrection and terrorism. In contrast, he said that Congress was promoting a coup d&#x27;état or a civil war with a declaration full of affirmations that had already been refuted beforehand and which in substance and process (directly handing it to the ministers rather than directly handing it to the president) violated a dozen articles of the then-current constitution. He further argued that the legislature was usurping the government&#x27;s executive function.

Allende wrote: &quot;Chilean democracy is a conquest by all of the people. It is neither the work nor the gift of the exploiting classes, and it will be defended by those who, with sacrifices accumulated over generations, have imposed it ... With a tranquil conscience ... I sustain that never before has Chile had a more democratic government than that over which I have the honor to preside ... I solemnly reiterate my decision to develop democracy and a state of law to their ultimate consequences...Congress has made itself a bastion against the transformations ... and has done everything it can to perturb the functioning of the finances and of the institutions, sterilizing all creative initiatives.&quot; Adding that economic and political means would be needed to relieve the country&#x27;s current crisis, and that the Congress was obstructing said means; having already paralyzed the state, they sought to destroy it. He concluded by calling upon the workers and all democrats and patriots to join him in defending the Chilean constitution and the revolutionary process.

==Preparations==
In mid-July, a month before the resolution of the Chamber of Deputies, there was general agreement in the heart of the Army&#x27;s high command on the desirability of terminating the Unidad Popular &quot;experiment.&quot; How to do it was still nebulous. The constitutional generals, gathered around Army Commander-in-Chief General Carlos Prats, were facing pressure from an increasingly hardline anti-Allende faction within the Army. Prats had coined the idea of an Allende–Armed Forces government, including a &quot;political peace treaty&quot; with the Christian Democrats and restricted participation of the Chilean Communist party and a group of Socialists. Prats argued that &quot;only thus will we prevent the extremist workers from rebelling.&quot; This idea had the support of Generals Joaquin Lagos Osorio, Herman Brady Roche, Washington Carrasco Fernandez, Hector Bravo Munoz, Mario Sepulveda Squella, Guillermo Pickering, and Orlando Urbina Herrera, but with variations. While Lagos Osorio and Urbina Herrera did not object to the Prats plan, the other five generals thought the Allende–Armed Forces government ought to be &quot;transitional&quot; and of &quot;short duration,&quot; to prepare conditions for a &quot;purely military government including the military police.&quot; The hardline faction, consisting of Generals Oscar Bonilla, Sergio Arellano Stark, and Javier Palacios formed another group, joined by Augusto Pinochet, which posited that the Allende–Armed Forces phase was not necessary.

==American involvement==

Many people in different parts of the world immediately suspected the U.S. of foul play. In early newspaper reports, the U.S. denied any involvement or previous knowledge of the coup. Prompted by an incriminating &quot;New York Times&quot; article, the U.S. Senate opened an investigation into U.S. interference in Chile. A report prepared by the United States Intelligence Community in 2000, at the direction of the National Intelligence Council, that echoed the Church committee, states that: The report stated that the CIA &quot;actively supported the military Junta after the overthrow of Allende but did not assist Pinochet to assume the Presidency.&quot; After a review of recordings of telephone conversations between Nixon and Henry Kissinger, Robert Dallek concluded that both of them used the CIA to actively destabilize the Allende government. In one particular conversation about the news of Allende&#x27;s overthrow, Kissinger complained about the lack of recognition of the American role in the overthrow of a &quot;communist&quot; government, upon which Nixon remarked, &quot;Well, we didn&#x27;t – as you know – our hand doesn&#x27;t show on this one.&quot; A later CIA report contended that US agents maintained close ties with the Chilean military to collect intelligence but no effort was made to assist them and &quot;under no circumstances attempted to influence them.&quot;

Historian Peter Winn found &quot;extensive evidence&quot; of United States complicity in the coup. He states that its covert support was crucial to engineering the coup, as well as for the consolidation of power by the Pinochet regime following the takeover. Winn documents an extensive CIA operation to fabricate reports of a coup against Allende, as justification for the imposition of military rule. Peter Kornbluh asserts that the CIA destabilized Chile and helped create the conditions for the coup, citing documents declassified by the Clinton administration. Other authors point to the involvement of the Defense Intelligence Agency, agents of which allegedly secured the missiles used to bombard the La Moneda Palace.

The U.S. Government&#x27;s hostility to the election of Allende in 1970 in Chile was substantiated in documents declassified during the Clinton administration, which show that CIA covert operatives were inserted in Chile in order to prevent a Marxist government from arising and for the purpose of spreading anti-Allende propaganda. As described in the Church Committee report, the CIA was involved in multiple plots designed to remove Allende and then let the Chileans vote in a new election where he would not be a candidate. The first, non-military, approach involved attempting a constitutional coup. This was known as the Track I approach, in which the CIA, with the approval of the 40 Committee, attempted to bribe the Chilean legislature, tried to influence public opinion against Allende, and provided funding to strikes designed to coerce him into resigning. It also attempted to get congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the presidential election. Alessandri, who was an accessory to the conspiracy, was ready to then resign and call for fresh elections. This approach completely failed in 1970 and was not attempted again.

The other approach of the CIA in 1970 (but not later), also known as the Track II approach, was an attempt to encourage a military coup by creating a climate of crisis across the country. A CIA telegram sent to the Chile station on 16 October 1970 stated:

False flag operatives contacted senior Chilean military officers and informed them that the U.S. would actively support a coup, but would revoke all military aid if such a coup did not happen. In addition, the CIA gave extensive support for black propaganda against Allende, channeled mostly through &quot;El Mercurio&quot;. Financial assistance was also given to Allende&#x27;s political opponents, and for organizing strikes and unrest to destabilize the government. By 1970, the U.S. manufacturing company ITT Corporation owned 70% of Chitelco (the Chilean Telephone Company), and also funded &quot;El Mercurio&quot;. The CIA used ITT as a means of disguising the source of the illegitimate funding Allende&#x27;s opponents received. On 28 September 1973, the Weather Underground bombed ITT&#x27;s headquarters in New York City in retaliation.

According to an article written by lifelong CIA operative Jack Devine, although it was widely reported that the CIA was directly involved in orchestrating and carrying out the coup, subsequently released sources suggest a much reduced role of the US government.

==Military action==

By 6:00 am on 11 September 1973, a date chosen to match a historical 1924 coup, the Navy captured Valparaíso, strategically stationing ships and marine infantry in the central coast and closed radio and television networks. The Province Prefect informed President Allende of the Navy&#x27;s actions; immediately, the president went to the presidential palace (La Moneda) with his bodyguards, the &quot;Group of Personal Friends&quot; (GAP). By 8:00 a.m., the Army had closed most radio and television stations in Santiago city, one of the first acts of the coup. By 8.30 a.m. both the carabineros and military broadcast their first edict, which would present a unified front that wanted Allende disposed. This edict declared that Allende would surrender his office to them and the carabineros and armed forces were a unified front that have tasked themselves with protecting Chile &quot;from falling beneath the Marxist yoke.&quot; By 9 a.m. the only loyalist broadcast still in control of its station was Radio Magallens, operated by the Chilean Communist Party. The Air Force bombed the remaining active stations and the President received incomplete information that convinced him that only a sector of the Navy conspired against him and his government.

President Allende and Defense Minister Orlando Letelier were unable to communicate with military leaders. Orlando Letelier would be arrested by the military when he reached the Defense Ministry. Following this, he would be imprisoned, then exiled and assassinated in Washington D.C. on 21 September 1976. There is evidence that his assassination was ordered by Pinochet. Admiral Montero, the Navy&#x27;s commander and an Allende loyalist, was rendered incommunicado; his telephone service was cut, and his cars were sabotaged before the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, to ensure he could not thwart the opposition. Leadership of the Navy was transferred to José Toribio Merino, planner of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and executive officer to Adm. Montero. Augusto Pinochet, General of the Army, and Gustavo Leigh, General of the Air Force, did not answer Allende&#x27;s telephone calls to them. The General Director of the &quot;Carabineros&quot; (uniformed police), José María Sepúlveda, and the head of the Investigations Police (plain clothes detectives), Alfredo Joignant answered Allende&#x27;s calls and immediately went to the &quot;La Moneda&quot; presidential palace. Despite evidence that all branches of the Chilean armed forces were involved in the coup, Allende hoped that some units remained loyal to the government. Allende was convinced of Pinochet&#x27;s loyalty, telling a reporter that the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; leaders must have imprisoned the general. Only at 8:30 am, when the armed forces declared their control of Chile and that Allende was deposed, did the president grasp the magnitude of the military&#x27;s rebellion. Despite the lack of any military support, Allende refused to resign his office.

At approx. 9:00 the carabineros of the La Moneda left the building. By 9:00 a.m., the armed forces controlled Chile, except for the city centre of the capital, Santiago. Originally, the military had planned to arrest Allende at his residence but he had made it to &quot;La Moneda,&quot; the presidential palace&quot;.&quot; There, Allende refused to surrender, despite the military&#x27;s declaring they would bomb the &quot;La Moneda&quot; if he resisted being deposed. The military would turn to negotiating with Allende where they would offer to fly him and his family out of Chile, which Allende would refuse. The Socialist Party along with his Cuban advisors proposed to Allende that he escape to the San Joaquín industrial zone in southern Santiago, to later re-group and lead a counter-&quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;; the president rejected the proposition. According to Tanya Harmer, Allende&#x27;s refusal to lead an insurgency against the coup is evidence of his unrelenting desire to bring about change through non-violent methods. The military attempted more negotiations with Allende, but the President refused to resign, citing his constitutional duty to remain in office. Finally, at 9:10  a.m., Allende gave a , telling the nation of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and his refusal to resign his elected office under threat.

Leigh ordered the presidential palace bombed but was told the Air Force&#x27;s Hawker Hunter jet aircraft would take forty minutes to arrive from their base at Concepcion. Pinochet ordered an armoured and infantry force under General Sergio Arellano to advance upon the &quot;La Moneda&quot; presidential palace. When the troops moved forward, they were forced to retreat after coming under fire from GAP snipers perched on rooftops. General Arellano called for helicopter gunship support from the commander of the Chilean Army Puma helicopter squadron and the troops were able to advance again. Chilean Air Force aircraft soon arrived to provide close air support for the assault (by bombing the Palace), but the defenders did not surrender until nearly 2:30 pm. Allende&#x27;s Cuban-trained guard would have had about 300 elite commando-trained GAP fighters at the time of the coup, according to a book of 2005 by Jonathan Haslam, but the use of brute military force, especially the use of Hawker Hunters, may have handicapped many GAP fighters from further action. Which was the case of some GAP members during the Hawker Hunters attack against Allende&#x27;s residence in Tomás Moro.

Allende would be found in his inner office dead, from a self inflicted bullet wound done between 2:00 and 2:30 p.m. Prior to Allende&#x27;s suicide, he addressed the nation one final time and stated hope for Chile in the future and wishing for the people to stay strong willed and overcome the darkness. In his own words he said: &quot;Workers of my country, I have faith in Chile and its destiny. Other men will overcome this dark and bitter moment when treason seeks to prevail. Keep in mind that, much sooner than later, the great avenues will again be opened through which will pass free men to construct a better society. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!&quot;

Pinochet&#x27;s rule would officially begin at 2:30 p.m. 11 September 1973.

==Casualties==

According to official reports prepared after the return of democracy, at La Moneda only two people died: President Allende and the journalist Augusto Olivares (both by suicide). Two more were injured, Antonio Aguirre and Osvaldo Ramos, both members of President Allende&#x27;s entourage; they would later be allegedly kidnapped from the hospital and disappeared. In November 2006, the Associated Press noted that more than 15 bodyguards and aides were taken from the palace during the coup and are still unaccounted for; in 2006 Augusto Pinochet was indicted for two of their deaths.

On the military side, there were 34 deaths: two army sergeants, three army corporals, four army privates, two navy lieutenants, one navy corporal, four naval cadets, three navy conscripts and fifteen carabineros. In mid-September, the Chilean military junta claimed its troops suffered another 16 dead and 100 injured by gunfire in mopping-up operations against Allende supporters, and Pinochet said: &quot;sadly there are still some armed groups who insist on attacking, which means that the military rules of wartime apply to them.&quot; A press photographer also died in the crossfire while attempting to cover the event. On 23 October 1973, 23-year-old army corporal Benjamín Alfredo Jaramillo Ruz, who was serving with the &quot;Cazadores&quot;, became the first fatal casualty of the counterinsurgency operations in the mountainous area of Alquihue in Valdivia after being shot by a sniper. The Chilean Army suffered 12 killed in various clashes with MIR guerrillas and GAP fighters in October 1973.

While fatalities in the battle during the coup might have been relatively small, the Chilean security forces sustained 162 dead in the three following months as a result of continued resistance, and tens of thousands of people were arrested during the coup and held in the National Stadium. An estimated 40,000 Chileans were tortured under the Pinochet regime in the years following the coup.

==Allende&#x27;s death==

President Allende died in La Moneda during the coup. The junta officially declared that he committed suicide with a rifle given to him by Fidel Castro, two doctors from the infirmary of La Moneda stated that they witnessed the suicide, and an autopsy labelled Allende&#x27;s death a suicide. Vice Admiral Patricio Carvajal, one of the primary instigators of the coup, claimed that &quot;Allende committed suicide and is dead now.&quot; Patricio Guijon, one of the president&#x27;s doctors, had testified to witnessing Allende shoot himself under the chin with the rifle while seated on a sofa.

At the time, few of Allende&#x27;s supporters believed the explanation that Allende had killed himself. Allende&#x27;s body was exhumed in May 2011. The exhumation was requested by members of the Allende family, including his daughter Isabel who viewed the question of her father&#x27;s death as &quot;an insult to scientific intelligence.&quot; A scientific autopsy was performed, and the autopsy team delivered a unanimous finding on 19 July 2011 that Allende committed suicide using an AK-47 rifle. The team was composed of international forensic experts to assure an independent evaluation.

However, on 31 May 2011, Chile&#x27;s state television station reported that a top-secret military account of Allende&#x27;s death had been discovered in the home of a former military justice official. The 300-page document was found only when the house was destroyed in the 2010 Chilean earthquake. After reviewing the report, two forensic experts told Televisión Nacional de Chile &quot;that they are inclined to conclude that Allende was assassinated.&quot; Two forensics experts said they believed he was shot with a small-calibre weapon prior to the AK-47. One expert, Luis Ravanal, noted the lack of blood on his collar, sweater and throat suggested someone else fired the AK-47 when he was already dead.

Allende&#x27;s widow and family escaped the military government and were accepted for exile in Mexico, where they remained for 17 years.

==Aftermath==
===Installing a new regime===

On 13 September, the Junta dissolved Congress, outlawed the parties that had been part of the Popular Unity coalition, and all political activity was declared &quot;in recess&quot;. The military government took control of all media, including the radio broadcasting that Allende attempted to use to give his final speech to the nation. It is not known how many Chileans actually heard the last words of Allende as he spoke them, but a transcript and audio of the speech survived the military government. Chilean scholar Lidia M. Baltra details how the military took control of the media platforms and turned them into their own &quot;propaganda machine&quot;. The only two newspapers that were allowed to continue publishing after the military takeover were &quot;El Mercurio&quot; and &quot;La Tercera de la Hora&quot;, both of which were anti-Allende under his leadership. The dictatorship&#x27;s silencing of the leftist point of view extended past the media and into &quot;every discourse that expressed any resistance to the regime&quot;. An example of this is the torturing and death of folk singer Víctor Jara. The military government detained Jara in the days following the coup. He, along with many other leftists, were held in Estadio Nacional, or the National Stadium of Chile in the capital of Santiago. Initially, the Junta tried to silence him by crushing his hands, but ultimately, he was murdered. Immediately after the coup the military sought television host Don Francisco to have him report on the events. Don Francisco declined the offer, encouraging the captain that had approached him to take the role of reporter himself.

Initially, there were four leaders of the junta: In addition to General Augusto Pinochet, from the Army, there were General Gustavo Leigh Guzmán, of the Air Force; Admiral José Toribio Merino Castro, of the Navy (who replaced Constitutionalist Admiral Raúl Montero); and General Director César Mendoza Durán, of the National Police (&quot;Carabineros de Chile&quot;) (who replaced Constitutionalist General Director José María Sepúlveda). Coup leaders soon decided against a rotating presidency and named General Pinochet permanent head of the junta which would establish a seventeen year long civil-military dictatorship.

In the months that followed the coup, the &quot;junta&quot;, with authoring work by historian Gonzalo Vial and Admiral Patricio Carvajal, published a book titled &quot;El Libro Blanco del cambio de gobierno en Chile&quot; (commonly known as &quot;El Libro Blanco&quot;, &quot;The White Book of the Change of Government in Chile&quot;), where they attempted to justify the coup by claiming that they were in fact anticipating a self-coup (the alleged &quot;Plan Zeta&quot;, or Plan Z) that Allende&#x27;s government or its associates were purportedly preparing. Historian Peter Winn states that the Central Intelligence Agency had an extensive part to play in fabricating the conspiracy and in selling it to the press, both in Chile and internationally. Although later discredited and officially recognized as the product of political propaganda, Gonzalo Vial has pointed to the similarities between the alleged Plan Z and other existing paramilitary plans of the Popular Unity parties in support of its legitimacy.

A document from September 13 shows that Jaime Guzmán was by then already tasked to study the creation of a new constitution. One of the first measures of the dictatorship was to set up a Secretaría Nacional de la Juventud (SNJ, National Youth Office). This was done on 28 October 1973, even before the Declaration of Principles of the junta made in March 1974. This was a way of mobilizing sympathetic elements of the civil society in support for the dictatorship.

===Continued violence===

In the first months after the &quot;coup d&#x27;état,&quot; the military killed thousands of Chilean leftists, both real and suspected, or forced their &quot;disappearance&quot;. The military imprisoned 40,000 political enemies in the National Stadium of Chile; among the tortured and killed &quot;desaparecidos&quot; (disappeared) were the U.S. citizens Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi. In October 1973, the Chilean songwriter Víctor Jara was murdered, along with 70 other people in a series of killings perpetrated by the death squad Caravan of Death (&quot;Caravana de la Muerte&quot;).

The government arrested some 130,000 people in a three-year period; the dead and disappeared numbered thousands in the first months of the military government. In Valparaiso, it is estimated that there were 6,918 victims of political capturing and torture. Those include the British physician Sheila Cassidy, who survived to publicize in the UK the human rights violations in Chile. Among those detained was Alberto Bachelet (father of future Chilean President Michelle Bachelet), an Air Force official; he was tortured and died on 12 March 1974, the right-wing newspaper, &quot;El Mercurio&quot;, reported that Mr Bachelet died after a basketball game, citing his poor cardiac health. Michelle Bachelet and her mother were imprisoned and tortured in the Villa Grimaldi detention and torture centre on 10 January 1975.

The newspaper &quot;La Tercera&quot; published on its front page a photograph showing prisoners at Quiriquina Island Camp who had been captured during the fighting in Concepción. The photograph&#x27;s caption stated that some of the detained were &quot;local bosses&quot; of Unidad Popular&quot; while others were &quot;extremists who had attacked the armed forces with firearms&quot;. The photo was reproduced 2013 in The Indicter, identifying among the &#x27;local bosses&#x27; Fernando Alvarez, then Concepción Province&#x27;s head authority appointed by Allende (executed one month thereafter); and among the fighting &#x27;extremists&#x27;, Marcello Ferrada de Noli, one founder of MIR and then professor at the University of Concepción.

This is consistent with reports in newspapers and broadcasts in Concepción about the activities of the Armed Forces, which mentioned clashes with &quot;extremists&quot; on several occasions from 11 to 14 September. Nocturnal skirmishes took place around the Hotel Alonso de Ercilla in Colo Colo and San Martín Street, one block away from the Army and military police administrative headquarters. A recently published testimony about the clashes in Concepción offers several plausible explanations for the reticence of witnesses to these actions.

Besides political leaders and participants, the coup also affected many everyday Chilean citizens. Pinochet and the military junta proclaimed that they were going to get rid of &quot;the cancerous tumor,&quot; in reference to Chile&#x27;s left. Thousands were killed, went missing, and were injured. Thousands more emigrated or were exiled because of the political instability in their country, many relocated elsewhere. Canada, among other countries, became a main point of refuge for many Chilean citizens. Through an operation known as &quot;Special Movement Chile&quot;, more than 7,000 Chileans were relocated to Canada in the months following 11 September 1973. These refugees are now known as Chilean Canadian people and have a population of over 38,000. Chileans would find asylum in over 40 countries around the world. While the exact number is unknown it is estimated that at least 200,000 Chileans left Chile between 1973–1990, the largest flow of emigration in Chile&#x27;s history.  

After Gen. Pinochet lost the election in the 1988 plebiscite, the Rettig Commission, a multi-partisan truth commission, in 1991 reported the location of torture and detention centers, among others, Colonia Dignidad, the tall ship &quot;Esmeralda&quot; and Víctor Jara Stadium. Later, in November 2004, the Valech Report confirmed the number as fewer than 3,000 killed and reduced the number of cases of forced disappearance; but some 28,000 people were arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. Sixty individuals died as a direct result of fighting on 11 September, although the MIR and GAP continued to fight the following day. It has been put forward that, in all, 46 of Allende&#x27;s guard (the GAP, &quot;Grupo de Amigos Personales&quot;) were killed, some of them in combat with the soldiers that took the Moneda. However, a report of 1999 published by an organization of ex-GAP which survived the events around the coup d&#x27;état, says that no one among the GAP members were killed in La Moneda combat. The source affirms that there were only 50 members of the GAP at that time, totally. The same information about the number of GAP members was later confirmed in an academic publication.

The U.S. view of the coup continues to spark controversy. Beginning in late 2014 in response to a request by Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies (CHDS), located at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints included that the Center knowingly protected a CHDS professor from Chile who was a former top advisor to Pinochet after belonging to the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional / DINA state terrorist organization (whose attack against a former Chilean foreign minister in 1976 in Washington, D.C., resulted in two deaths, including that of an American). &quot;Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extrajudicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive&quot;, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the author of the &quot;Leahy Law&quot; prohibiting U.S. assistance to military units and members of foreign security forces that violate human rights.

Roberto Thieme, the military leader of Fatherland and Liberty, who was imprisoned on 11 September was shocked to hear about the degree of violence the coup was carried out with. Despite being an arduous opponent of Unidad Popular he had expected a cleaner coup.

===International reaction===
President of Argentina Juan Domingo Perón condemned the coup calling it a &quot;fatality for the continent&quot;. Before the coup Perón had warned the more radical of his followers to stay calm and &quot;not do as Allende&quot;. Argentine students protested the coup at the Chilean embassy in Buenos Aires, where part of them chanted that they were &quot;ready to cross the Andes&quot; (&quot;dispuestos a cruzar la cordillera&quot;).

In Francoist Spain the coup came as a schock to the opposition many whom immediately identified the parallels between Francisco Franco and Pinochet and between the coup and the Spanish Civil War. Since Spain was still under authoritarian rule the opposition was limited in its range of action. The Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party officially condemned the coup in its 1974 congress in France and &quot;Mundo Obrero&quot; of the Communist Party of Spain called for resistance against the new regime.

===Legal impact===
A number of cargo shipments involving trade with Cuba were affected by government policy decisions, and subsequently performance of the trade contracts underlying the shipping deliveries was made illegal under Cuban law. The Chilean company Iansa had purchased sugar from the Cuban business entity, Cubazukar, and several shipments were at different stages of the shipping and delivery process. The ships involved included:
* &quot;Playa Larga&quot; (delivery in Chile was underway but was not completed before the ship left)
* The &quot;Marble Island&quot; (the ship was &quot;en route&quot; for Chile but was diverted elsewhere)
* &quot;Aegis Fame&quot; (hire was cancelled before the cargo had been loaded).

The shipping contracts used c.i.f. trade terms. Iansa sued Cubazukar for non-delivery. The High Court (in England) ruled that IANSA was entitled to damages in respect of the undelivered balance of the &quot;Playa Larga&quot; cargo and to restitution of the price paid for the &quot;Marble Island&quot; cargo. Subsequent appeals by both parties were dismissed. In regard to the &quot;Aegis Fame&quot; shipping, the contract was frustrated and therefore Cubazukar were not in breach.

==Commemoration==
The commemoration of the coup is associated to competing narratives on its cause and effects. The coup has been commemorated by detractors and supporters in various ways.

On 11 September 1975 Pinochet lit the Llama de la Libertad (lit. Flame of Liberty) to commemorate the coup. This flame was extinguished in 2004. Avenida Nueva Providencia in Providencia, Santiago, was renamed Avenida 11 de Septiembre in 1980. In the 30th anniversary of the coup President Ricardo Lagos inaugurated the Morandé 80 entrance to La Moneda. This entrance to the presidential palace had been erased during the repairs the dictatorship did to the building after the bombing.

===40th anniversary===
The 40th anniversary of the coup in 2013 was particularly intense. That year the name of Avenida 11 de Septiembre was reversed to the original Avenida Nueva Providencia. The Association of Chilean Magistrates issued a public statement in early September 2013 recognizing the past unwillingness of judges to protect those persecuted by dictatorship. On 11 September 2013 hundreds of Chileans posed as dead in the streets of Santiago in remembrance of the ones &quot;disappeared&quot; by the dictatorship.

The centre-left opposition refused to attend the commemoration event organized by Sebastián Piñera&#x27;s right-wing government organizing instead a separate event. Osvaldo Andrade of the Socialist Party explained that attendance was not viable as Piñera&#x27;s government was &quot;packed with passive accomplices&quot; of the dictatorship. Some right-wing politicians also declined the invitation. Presidential candidate Michelle Bachelet planned to spend the day visiting Museum of Memory and Human Rights. President Piñera held an unusual speech in which he denounced &quot;passive accomplices&quot; like news reporters who deliberately changed or omitted the truth and judges who rejected recursos de amparos that could have saved lives. People who knew things or could have known things but decided to stay quiet were also criticized as passive accomplices in Piñera&#x27;s speech.

A number of new films, theatre plays, and photography expositions were held to cast light on the abuses and censorship of the dictatorship. The number of new books published on the subject in 2013 was such that it constituted an editorial boom. The Museum of Memory and Human Rights also displayed a collection of declassified CIA, FBI, Defense Department, and White House records illustrating the U.S. role in the dictatorship and the coup. Conferences and seminars on the subject of coup were also held. Various series and interviews with politicians on the subject of the coup and the dictatorship were aired on Chilean TV in 2013.

===50th anniversary===

Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the coup in 2023, the United States under the Biden administration finally declassified President Nixon&#x27;s daily briefs related to Chile from 8 to 11 September 1973. The document for 8 September read: &quot;A number of reports have been received... indicating the possibility of an early military coup. Navy men plotting to overthrow the government now claim army and air force support.&quot; It further noted that the far-right paramilitary group, Fatherland and Freedom &quot;has been blocking roads and provoking clashes with the national police, adding to the tension caused by continuing strikes and opposition political moves. President Allende earlier this week said he believed the armed forces will ask for his resignation if he does not change his economic and political policies.&quot;

The week before the anniversary, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, along with all four living former presidentsEduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Ricardo Lagos, Michelle Bachelet, and Sebastian Piñerasigned an declaration titled &quot;Commitment: For Democracy, Forever&quot;, stating that it should &quot;confront the challenges of democracy with more democracy&quot; and it should defend and promote human rights. The right-wing opposition called it &quot;biased&quot; and refused to sign it.

On the day of the anniversary, Boric, Bachelet, and many world leaders, including Mexico&#x27;s Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Portugal&#x27;s António Costa, Colombia&#x27;s Gustavo Petro, Bolivia&#x27;s Luis Arce, and Uruguay&#x27;s Luis Lacalle Pou attended an commemoration in La Moneda presidential palace to commemorate the coup and its aftermath. Others who attended were former Uruguayan president José Mujica and lead Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello, who said that the United States &quot;shares responsibility&quot; for the coup.

At the commemoration, Boric said:

A coup d&#x27;état or the violation of the human rights of those who think differently is never justifiable. It is crucial to clearly state that the coup d&#x27;état cannot be separated from what came afterward. Human-rights violations of Chilean men and women began right from the moment of the coup [...] It was a dictatorship until the end [...] Reconciliation is not achieved through neutrality or distance but by unequivocally standing with those who were victims of the horror. Reconciliation, dear compatriots, does not involve attempting to equate the responsibilities between victims and perpetrators.

Surveys showed that 60% of Chileans surveyed were not interested in the commemoration, while another poll claimed that nearly 40% believed Pinochet &quot;modernised&quot; the country. Other data found that more than a third of Chileans believed the coup was justified.

<text>A denehole (alternatively dene hole or dene-hole) is an underground structure consisting of a number of small chalk caves entered by a vertical shaft. The name is given to certain caves or excavations in England, which have been popularly supposed to have been created by the Danes or some other of the early northern invaders of the country. The common spelling Dane hole is adduced as evidence of this, and individual names, such as Vortigern&#x27;s Caves at Margate, and Canute&#x27;s Gold Mine near Bexley, naturally follow the same theory. The word, however, is probably derived from the Anglo Saxon &quot;den&quot;, a hole or valley. The lack of evidence found in them has led to long arguments as to their function.

==Form==

The general outline of the formation of these caves is invariably the same. The entrance is a vertical shaft some 3 feet (1 m) in diameter falling, on an average, to a depth of 60 feet (20 m). The depth is regulated by the depth of the chalk layer from the surface, although chalk can be found within a few feet, or even inches, from the surface. A depth of from 45 to 80 feet or more, is a characteristic feature.

Footholds were cut into the sides of the shaft to allow people to climb in and out. The shaft, when the chalk is reached, widens out into a domed chamber with a roof of chalk some 3 feet thick. The walls frequently contract somewhat as they near the floor. As a rule the main chamber is 16 to 18 feet in height, beneath each shaft. From this excessive height it has been inferred that the caves were not primarily intended for habitations or even hiding-places. In most cases, between two and four sub-chambers are present, excavated laterally from the floor level, the roof being supported by pillars of chalk left standing.

==Distribution==

There are many underground excavations in the south of England, also found to some extent in the Midlands and the north, but true deneholes are found chiefly in those parts of Kent and Essex along the lower banks of the Thames. With one exception there are no recorded specimens farther east than those of the Grays Thurrock district, situated in Hangman&#x27;s Wood, on the north, and one near Challock on the south side of the river south of Faversham. Isolated specimens have been discovered in various parts of Kent and Essex, but the most important groups have been found at Grays Thurrock, in the districts of Woolwich, Abbey Wood and Bexley, and at Gravesend. Those at Bexley and Grays Thurrock are the most valuable still existing. It is generally found that the tool work on the roof or ceiling is rougher than that on the walls, where an upright position could be maintained.

==History==

Pliny the Elder wrote about British chalk extraction in A.D. 70 and archaeological evidence shows that at least some of the deneholes were being exploited during prehistory. Casts taken of some of the pick-holes near the roof show that, in all probability, they were made by bone or horn picks. Numerous bone picks have been discovered in Essex and Kent. These pick-holes are amongst the most valuable data for the study of deneholes, and have assisted in fixing the date of their formation to pre-Roman times. However, very few artifacts which would provide dating evidence or assisted in determining the uses of these prehistoric excavations have been discovered in any of the known deneholes. Chrétien de Troyes has a passage on caves in Britain which may have reference to deneholes, and tradition of the 14th century treated the deneholes of Grays as the fabled gold mines of Cunobeline (or Cymbeline) of the 1st century.

In 1225 Henry III gave every man the right to sink a marl pit on his own land. Spreading chalk on the fields was a common practice in the Middle Ages. This appears to have continued into the 19th century. The need for chalk in agriculture supports the theory that the origin of deneholes was for chalk extraction.

Vortigern&#x27;s Caves at Margate are possibly deneholes which have been adapted later for other purposes; and excellent examples of various pick-holes may be seen on different parts of the walls.

Local tradition in some cases suggests the use of these caves by smugglers. Illicit traffic was common not only on the coast but in the Thames as far up the river as Barking Creek. The theory is at least plausible that these ready-made hiding-places, which were difficult of approach and dangerous to descend, were used in this way.

==Purpose==

By the end of the nineteenth century, three purposes had been suggested for which deneholes may have been originally excavated:

* as hiding-places or dwellings,
* as storehouses for grain, or
* as draw-wells for the extraction of chalk for agricultural uses.

For several reasons it is unlikely that they were used as habitations, although they may have been used occasionally as hiding places. Silos, or underground storehouses, are well-known in southern Europe and in Morocco. It has been suggested that grain was stored unthreshed and carefully protected from damp by straw. A curious smoothness of the roof of one of the chambers of the Gravesend twin-chamber denehole has been put forward as additional evidence in support of this theory.

Since the 1950s the theory that they were ancient chalk mines has gained acceptance. This was formerly thought unlikely, as it was reasoned that chalk could have been obtained outcropping close by. J.E.L. Caiger worked in Kent excavating, surveying and researching deneholes, and concluded that they were excavated in prehistoric, Roman, medieval and even post-medieval times in order to produce a supply of unpolluted chalk to spread on fields for the purposes of marling. By excavating a narrow shaft the miners used up as little of the productive agricultural land as possible. He suggested various other practical matters that supported his ideas, including the facts that opencast chalk extraction would require moving the material further than necessary and that shallower chalk deposits have much of their minor mineral content leached out by groundwater.

Another theory that has been advanced is that the excavations were made in order to get flints for implements.

<text>HMS &quot;Furious&quot; was a modified built for the Royal Navy (RN) during the First World War. Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord, Lord Fisher, the ship was very lightly armoured and designed with a main battery of only two 18-inch (457 mm) guns. &quot;Furious&quot; was modified as an aircraft carrier while under construction. Her forward turret was removed and a flight deck was added in its place, such that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land. Later in the war, the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure, but this was less than satisfactory due to air turbulence. &quot;Furious&quot; was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full-length flight deck in the early 1920s. Her half-sisters and were also rebuilt as aircraft carriers around that time.

After her conversion, &quot;Furious&quot; was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft, and later as a training ship once large, modern fleet carriers such as entered service in the 1930s. During the early months of the Second World War, the carrier spent her time hunting for German raiders in the North Atlantic and escorting convoys. This changed dramatically during the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940, when her aircraft provided air support to British troops ashore in addition to attacking German shipping. The first of what would be numerous aircraft ferry missions was made by the carrier during the campaign. After the withdrawal of British troops in May, &quot;Furious&quot; made several anti-shipping strikes in Norway with little result before beginning a steady routine of ferrying aircraft for the Royal Air Force.

At first, &quot;Furious&quot; made several trips to West Africa, but she began to ferry aircraft to Gibraltar in 1941. An unsuccessful attack on German-occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean interrupted the ferry missions in mid-1941. &quot;Furious&quot; was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942. She made several more ferry trips in mid-1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in Vichy French Algeria as part of the opening stages of Operation Torch in November 1942. The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet.

&quot;Furious&quot; spent most of 1943 training, but made a number of attacks on the and other targets in Norway during the first half of 1944. By September 1944, the ship was showing her age and she was placed in reserve. &quot;Furious&quot; was decommissioned in April 1945, but was not sold for scrap until 1948.

==Design and description==
During the First World War, Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding s by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers. To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles, such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders, he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser. He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast, shallow-draught ships for his Baltic Project, a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast.

&quot;Furious&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced normally and at deep load. She had a metacentric height of at deep load. &quot;Furious&quot; and her half-sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines. To save design time, the installation used in the light cruiser , the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines, was copied and simply duplicated to provide two sets of turbines. The four Brown-Curtis turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow small-tube boilers that were designed to produce a total of . The ship&#x27;s speed was an estimated , but she never ran her sea trials.

&quot;Furious&quot; was designed to normally carry of fuel oil, but could carry a maximum of . At full capacity, she could steam for an estimated at a speed of . The ship was designed to carry two BL 18-inch Mark I guns in two single turrets, one each fore (&#x27;A&#x27;) and aft (&#x27;Y&#x27;). Her secondary armament consisted of 11 BL Mk I guns. A pair of quick-firing (QF) 3-inch (76 mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were mounted before the funnel. &quot;Furious&quot; was also fitted with two submerged tubes for torpedoes for which 10 torpedoes were carried.

Even as she was being built, &quot;Furious&quot; was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle that replaced the forward turret. A 160-foot (49 m) flight deck was built along its roof. Aircraft were flown off and, rather less successfully, landed on this deck. Floatplanes like the Short Type 184 used a four-wheel trolley that ran down a track along the centre of the flight deck for take-off. Aircraft were lifted by crane from the hangar to the flight deck. Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun tested, it was not long before &quot;Furious&quot; returned to her builders for further modifications. In November 1917, the rear turret was replaced by a 300-foot (91 m) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar. Her funnel and superstructure remained intact, with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks. Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden. Her 18-inch guns were reused on the s and during the war.

&quot;Furious&quot; was laid down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s Low Walker shipyard in Newcastle upon Tyne. The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917. As completed, her complement numbered 737 officers and ratings.

==Aircraft landing and the First World War==

On 2 August 1917, while performing trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup on &quot;Furious&quot;, becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship. On 7 August, he made another landing in the same manner, but on his third attempt the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow into the sea. Knocked unconscious, he drowned in the cockpit. The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land. Dunning&#x27;s replacement as the head of &quot;Furious″&quot; air group, Frederick Rutland, performed a landing in the same manner as Dunning, after which he stopped these experiments, reporting to the Admiralty that the average lifespan of a pilot making a landing like this would be ten landings, in good weather.

The three &quot;Courageous&quot;-class ships were assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS) in October 1917 when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October, possibly indicating a raid. Admiral David Beatty, commander of the Grand Fleet, ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea to locate the enemy ships. &quot;Furious&quot; was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4° East and to return before dark. and were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day. Two German light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed the Scandinavia convoy during the morning of 17 October, but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon. The 1st CS was ordered to intercept the German ships, but they proved to be faster than expected and the British ships were unsuccessful.

&quot;Furious&quot; returned to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing, giving her both a launching and a recovery deck. Two lifts (elevators) serving the hangars were also installed. &quot;Furious&quot; was recommissioned on 15 March 1918, and her embarked aircraft were used on anti-Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May. In July 1918, she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid, attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success.

==Conversion==

===Overview===
&quot;Furious&quot; was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier with a continuous flight deck between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on experience gained with the first two British carriers, and , although this was very limited as &quot;Argus&quot; was less than three years old and &quot;Eagle&quot; had carried out only 143 deck landings during her preliminary sea trials in 1920.

The ship&#x27;s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at that time. The fore-and-aft arresting gear was not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used minimised turbulence.
&quot;Furious&quot; was not lengthened, but her beam was increased to and her average draught was now at deep load, deeper than before the conversion. She displaced at normal load and at deep load, over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement. Her metacentric height was at deep load, a reduction of after her conversion. During the ship&#x27;s post-conversion sea trials she reached . Her fuel capacity was increased by during her reconstruction, which increased her range to at a speed of or at a speed of .

A two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, in height per level. The lower hangar was long by wide and the upper was . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters which improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Like &quot;Argus&quot;, &quot;Furious&quot; was flush-decked and lacked an island superstructure to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck, starboard, and was provided with a retractable charthouse forward, on the flight deck centreline. The ship could normally carry about 36 aircraft.

Two lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. No arresting gear was fitted and two ready-use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship&#x27;s boats on the upper deck. An additional of petrol were in bulk storage. In 1939, her complement consisted of 41 officers and 754 crewmen.

===Armament===
&quot;Furious&quot; retained ten of her original eleven breech-loading guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships. Six QF 4-inch Mark V guns replaced her original anti-aircraft guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the quarterdeck. The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed in 1926–27 for trials of the lower flight deck, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded. Four single QF 2-pounder &quot;pom-poms&quot; were installed in 1927. During &quot;Furious&quot;″s September 1930 – February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was reinforced by the addition of two eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V pom-pom mounts where the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck had been removed earlier.

The 5.5-inch and 4-inch guns were replaced during her refit in early 1939 by a dozen QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns in six twin dual-purpose Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side. Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island superstructure at the same time. While later refitting in the United States, the ship was fitted with a maximum of 22 manually operated automatic Oerlikon light anti-aircraft guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount.

A single High Angle Control System director was fitted on the island and another on an elevated mount on the former flying-off deck. Two pom-pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island.

==Inter-war service==

&quot;Furious&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily. The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather. The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard &quot;Furious&quot;. In the 1920s, the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters (Fairey Flycatcher), two of spotters (Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison), one spotter reconnaissance (Fairey IIID) and two flights of torpedo bombers (Blackburn Dart), each usually of six aircraft.

&quot;Furious&quot; was reduced to reserve on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport. It lasted from September 1930 to February 1932 and was focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers. In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars. Upon completion, she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was from a total of .
&quot;Furious&quot; recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November. Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934. &quot;Furious&quot; was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted in Devonport between December 1937 and May 1938 where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the Munich Crisis in September 1938, the ship embarked 801, 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow, before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair. She was struck a glancing blow by the destroyer during this time, but suffered only minor damage.

From 1933 to the end of 1938, &quot;Furious&quot; carried 801 Squadron which initially flew a mixture of six Hawker Nimrod and three Flycatcher fighters. Hawker Osprey fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936. 811 and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti-shipping missions. They flew the Blackburn Ripon, the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers as well as the Fairey IIIF, the Fairey Seal and the Blackburn Shark reconnaissance aircraft.

The ship was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on her lower flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. &quot;Furious&quot; resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939. As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 &quot;Furious&quot; embarked 767 Squadron, flying Shark, Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, and 769 Squadron, flying Blackburn Skua, Blackburn Roc, and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters.

==Second World War==
&quot;Furious&quot; remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland until 2 October 1939. She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken &quot;Courageous&quot; and embarked nine Swordfish aircraft from 816 Squadron and a detachment of three more Swordfish from 818 Squadron. The ship sortied on 8 October with the fleet to unsuccessfully hunt for the and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. After returning from this search, &quot;Furious&quot; departed her berth adjacent to the battleship in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was sunk by . Afterwards she was transferred to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she and the battlecruiser formed a hunting group for German raiders. &quot;Furious&quot; served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid-December 1939. In the darkness on 17 December, the west-bound ocean liner RMS &quot;Samaria&quot; passed through the convoy unseen. She ripped off the horizontal wireless masts on &quot;Furious&quot;″s starboard side, carried away five overhanging lifeboats from the port side of , and just missed the third and fourth ships in line.

===Norwegian campaign===

&quot;Furious&quot; joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 with only eighteen Swordfish from 816 and 818 Squadrons embarked; no fighters were able to join the ship in time. Sixteen Swordfish made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on German ships in Trondheim harbour the following morning. On 12 April, both squadrons attempted to attack German ships in Narvik in bad weather. Disappointed with the failure of the torpedo attacks the previous day, bombs were carried instead. 818 Squadron, making the first attack, damaged several captured Norwegian ships, but lost two aircraft to flak, although the crews were rescued by the British cruiser and the destroyer . Following 40 minutes behind, 816 Squadron was forced to turn back by heavy weather. One aircraft was lost while landing, but the crew was recovered. Another attack was launched the next day in support of the British ships entering Narvik, but they contributed little and another pair of Swordfish were shot down.

&quot;Furious&quot;, ordered to remain behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, departed the Narvik area on 14 April, escorted by three destroyers, to refuel at Tromsø. En route, her Swordfish attacked Junkers Ju 52 transports that had landed on frozen Lake Hartvikvatnet approximately northeast of Narvik. Two of the Ju 52s were destroyed and several others damaged. She reached the port on 16 April with only 27% of her fuel remaining. She stayed there until 18 April when she headed south to scout the Narvik area. She was attacked en route by a single Heinkel He 111 bomber of the II./KG 26 wing from very high altitude. Two large bombs narrowly missed the ship, the closest only off the port side aft. The shock shook her propeller shafts out of alignment and jarred the port inner high-pressure turbine so she was limited to . &quot;Furious&quot; remained off the coast of Norway despite the damage and attempted to fly off aircraft on 22 April, despite severe weather, to discourage German aircraft from delivering supplies to the German forces in Narvik. One aircraft was shot down by the Germans and the others returned reporting heavy snowstorms between the ship and Narvik. The weather worsened the next day and Captain Troubridge decided to head to Harstad to check the damage from the near miss. It proved worse than anticipated and he was ordered back to the United Kingdom. Only six of the nine remaining Swordfish were serviceable.

After quick repairs, which included the removal of several rows of turbine blades, &quot;Furious&quot; returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed Royal Air Force 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at Bardufoss was ready. One Gladiator and the guiding Swordfish crashed en route, killing all crewmen. The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off, carrying only six Sea Gladiators of 804 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 816 Squadron for self-protection while ferrying 263 Squadron.

On 14 June, carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection, &quot;Furious&quot; sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying £18,000,000 in gold bullion. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used to transport sugar to Britain. Upon her arrival, she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron, as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 825, and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø in September and October 1940, at a cost of several aircraft. Both Swordfish squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport.

===Ferry duties===

&quot;Furious&quot; loaded 55 aircraft, mostly crated Hawker Hurricane fighters of No. 73 Squadron RAF, in Liverpool on 7 November 1940 sailing for Takoradi, Gold Coast, on 15 November 1940 where they were flown off or off-loaded on 27 November with the ultimate destination of Egypt. During this time, she retained only six Skuas of 801 Squadron for her own protection. &quot;Furious&quot; was back in Liverpool by 15 December where she embarked 40 more Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December 1940 joining with Convoy WS5A and the small carrier &quot;Argus&quot;. The encountered the convoy on 25 December 1940, but little damage was inflicted by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in &quot;Argus&quot; with bombs that they could not carry and their torpedoes were aboard &quot;Furious&quot;. After &quot;Furious&quot;″s Skuas had flown off to search for &quot;Hipper&quot;, space was made to land the Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; because of the poor visibility. &quot;Furious&quot; reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 arriving back in Britain on 5 February 1941 where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi on 4 March, carrying 12 Fairey Fulmars of 807 Squadron and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self-defence.

&quot;Furious&quot; now had a new destination for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to to be flown off for Malta. She sailed for a brief refit at Belfast immediately afterwards. While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near-missed by two others during a German air raid in early May, but was only lightly damaged. The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane IIs, plus nine Fulmars from &#x27;X&#x27; Flight of 800 Squadron in Liverpool, and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. &quot;Furious&quot; loaded 48 more Hurricane IIs and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June where some of the fighters were transferred to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters. &quot;Furious&quot; returned to the Clyde for her biggest load of aircraft yet, 64 Hurricanes, leaving room for only nine Swordfish from 816 Squadron on this voyage. Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day. Of the 42 Hurricanes left on &quot;Furious&quot;, 26 were moved to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; when she returned on 28 June. This time, however, both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual take-off point west of Sicily. The tenth of &quot;Furious&quot;″s aircraft to take off crashed into her island, killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck. The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar. &quot;Furious&quot; exchanged 816 Squadron for 818 from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, then departed for home.

In July, &quot;Furious&quot; embarked nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron, &#x27;A&#x27; Flight of 880 Squadron with four Sea Hurricane IBs, nine Swordfish from 812 Squadron and nine Albacores of 817 Squadron to attack the German-occupied ports of Kirkenes, Norway, and Petsamo, Finland, departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with the carrier , two cruisers and six destroyers. The two carriers and their escorts gathered in Seidisfjord, Iceland, under the command of Rear Admiral Wake-Walker where they refuelled in late July. &quot;Furious&quot; attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all her Swordfish and Albacores, escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes, but there was very little shipping present. One small ship, MV &quot;Trotter&quot;, was sunk, several oil storage tanks were set afire, and several wooden jetties were torpedoed. The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences. &quot;Furious&quot; was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards, but she transferred her Albacores to &quot;Victorious&quot; to fill up that carrier&#x27;s decimated squadrons before she left. Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing Dornier Do 18 flying boat on 31 July as the ship was leaving.

On 30 August, &quot;Furious&quot; left Belfast with a load of 49 Hurricanes, carrying three Fulmars of 800 Squadron and four Sea Hurricane IBs of 880A Squadron for self-defence, and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; sailed for the departure point the following day, but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes because some of the Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous. When &quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned, she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to &quot;Furious&quot; and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes. This was &quot;Furious&quot;″s last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a lengthy refit. She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942.

&quot;Furious&quot; spent the next three months after her return working up. In August, she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal, but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta. This she did, just as &quot;Eagle&quot; was torpedoed, but &quot;Furious&quot; turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day southeast of the Balearic Islands. After this mission, &quot;Furious&quot; was sent back to the Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch and the ship arrived at Gibraltar on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on 29 August before returning to Gibraltar and being assigned to Force H.

As part of Operation Torch, &quot;Furious&quot; embarked 12 Supermarine Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron, another 12 Seafire IICs of 807 Squadron and nine Albacores of 822 Squadron to provide air cover for the amphibious landings by the Central Task Force. On the morning of 8 November, &quot;Furious&quot;″s Seafires strafed the Vichy French airfield at Tafraoui, destroying three aircraft on the ground and shooting down one Dewoitine D.520 fighter, the first air-to-air kill by a Seafire. Eight Albacores, escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two escort carriers, attacked the field at La Senia. They were attacked by D.520s as they began their attack dive, but they destroyed 47 aircraft on the ground despite the loss of an Albacore from anti-aircraft fire and the loss of three and damage to two more against the French fighters. Seafires of 807 Squadron from &quot;Furious&quot; covered the landings at Oran, engaging a flight of D.520s, shooting down three and destroying about twenty aircraft on the ground.

===Home waters===
&quot;Furious&quot; remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to the Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July, the fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the Allied invasion of Sicily; &quot;Furious&quot;″s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report, then shoot it down. She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training. During the passage of Convoy JW 57 from the UK to Russia in February 1944, &quot;Furious&quot;, escorted by the British battleship and the , attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast on 24 February 1944. The carrier had the Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron aboard, plus the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 827 Squadron and 830 Squadrons. No aircraft were lost and a beached freighter was destroyed.

In preparation for Operation Tungsten, an attack on the , &quot;Furious&quot; and &quot;Victorious&quot; exchanged Barracuda squadrons, 827 for 831 Squadron, so that the squadrons that trained together could fly together. &quot;Furious&quot; also embarked 880 Squadron with eight Seafire L.IIC fighters to reinforce the six Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron. On the morning of 3 April 1944, 21 Barracudas of 827 and 830 Squadrons made the first attack just as the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was getting under way for sea trials. The Germans were caught entirely by surprise and the &quot;Tirpitz&quot;″s smokescreen was only just beginning to form. The British aircraft enjoyed a clear view of their target and hit the German battleship six times. An hour later, the second wave of 19 Barracudas from 829 and 831 Squadrons arrived and scored eight more hits. Only one Barracuda was shot down from each wave and another crashed on take-off. 801 and 880 Squadrons were retained for fleet air defence during the operation. &quot;Tirpitz&quot;″s superstructure and upper hull was moderately damaged by the bombs, but her machinery was intact because the Barracuda pilots pressed home their attack below the altitude necessary to give their armour-piercing bombs enough velocity to penetrate &quot;Tirpitz&quot;″s main armoured deck. Nonetheless &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was under repair for three months.

The Home Fleet tried another attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; later on 23 April 1944, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made that day and for the next several days. Instead, the aircraft attempted to attack installations at Bodø on 26 April 1944, but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. &quot;Furious&quot; and the escort carrier attacked shipping in the vicinity of Kristiansund and sank the ore carrier &quot;Almora&quot; and the tanker &quot;Saarburg&quot; for the loss of two aircraft on 6 May 1944. Another attack on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May 1944 because of poor weather. Yet another attempt on 28 May was foiled by bad weather, but a German convoy was successfully attacked on 1 June 1944. One ammunition ship was sunk and two others were set on fire.

&quot;Furious&quot; and the fleet carriers and made another attempt to sink the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; on 17 July 1944, in Operation Mascot. For this attack, the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire L.IICs, 20 Grumman Hellcats of 1840 Squadron, Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight. The Barracudas, heavily loaded with bombs of up to , launched using a wooden ramp that was temporarily placed at the end of the flight deck, an early example of what was to be later named the ski-jump. The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly through the smoke. Four more attacks on &quot;Tirpitz&quot; were made in August 1944 under the name of Operation Goodwood in a concerted effort to sink her. &quot;Furious&quot; carried twelve Seafire F.IIIs of 801 Squadron, another twelve Seafire L.IICs of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation. The first attack on 20 August 1944 was recalled because of bad weather, but the attack on 22 August 1944 was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost. Another attack was made two days later; one armour-piercing bomb penetrated &quot;Tirpitz&quot;″s armoured deck but failed to detonate, and another bomb did only superficial damage. A fourth attack was made on 29 August, but inflicted no damage.

By this time, the ship&#x27;s age and limitations became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. The ship was paid off in April 1945 being berthed at Loch Striven, was used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship&#x27;s structure. &quot;Furious&quot; was sold in 1948 for scrap, and had been completely broken up in Troon by 1954.

<text>The Chrysler Royal was a full-size car produced by the Chrysler Corporation in the United States. It was first released in 1933 and continued being built until 1934. Then, the model ended production and did not return until 1937, and then continued until 1950.

==Chrysler Eight==
For production year 1931, Chrysler introduced their first straight eight engine for the Chrysler Imperial, and offered it in the Chrysler Eight Series CD. It borrowed appearance influences from the Cord L-29. The engine used had a displacement that was smaller than the one used in the Imperial Series CG, followed in 1932 with the Chrysler Series CP and an upgraded engine, while both Eights used a wheelbase. The Chrysler Eight offered sweeping fenders, rear suicide doors, dual windshield wipers, dual taillights and dual chrome trumpet horns, sharing an appearance with the 1931 Chrysler Imperial Series CG, and was available with five different two-door body style choices that could accommodate between two through five passengers, and three four-door coachwork choices were offered, to include a sedan convertible and two versions of the Royal Sedan in Standard and Special trim packages. Prices ranged from US$1,495 ($ in dollars ) for the two-door Sport Roadster to US$1,970 ($ in dollars ) for the four-door Dual Cowl Phaeton. A stripped-down Chrysler Eight Series CD Sport Roadster was entered along with an Imperial roadster in the 1931 24 Hours of Le Mans but did not finish due to radiator issues.

Large displacement engines provided the horsepower and torque clients wanted and due to the low quality of gasoline fuel at the time, and low compression ratios, 50 bhp was more than adequate. It is estimated that the rating equivalent of early gasoline available varied from 40 to 60 octane and that the &quot;High-Test&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;fighting grade&quot;, probably averaged 50 to 65 octane.

==Chrysler Royal (eight cylinder engine)==
The Chrysler Royal is a full-size car that was produced by Chrysler. The &quot;Royal&quot; nameplate was added to the 1932 Chrysler Eight Series CP and appeared in 1933 as the Chrysler Royal Series CT and was previously used to describe a top level trim package on sedans. The Royal was originally installed with the Chrysler Straight Eight, and it was the second Chrysler to use a nameplate that didn&#x27;t refer to a &quot;Series&quot; designation that referred to an internal body code or the speed it was capable of in past products. The first Chrysler product to do so was the Imperial, which it originally shared a shortened chassis. The Royal was offered as a two-door Business Coupe, Roadster Coupe, Convertible Coupe, a two-door, five-passenger Convertible Sedan and four-door Sedan using a shorter wheelbase from previous years. The longer wheelbase was used for the eight-passenger sedan, while the longer wheelbase was available as a cowl and chassis only for special coachwork choices from private companies, of which 95 were documented to have been built. Prices ranged from US$895 ($ in dollars ) for the business coupe to US$1,085 ($ in dollars ) for the convertible sedan, while the long wheelbase was listed at US$1,125 ($ in dollars ), offering the appearance of the flagship Imperial but at an affordable price.

==Chrysler Royal (six cylinder engine)==
The &quot;Royal&quot; nameplate was used for one year in 1933 when the Airflow replaced the Royal in 1934, then brought back as a new model in 1937 when the Airflow sold poorly, and was sold alongside the Airflow which continued to offer the Chrysler Straight Eight. The Airflow received no direct successor. A November 1936 advertisement listed the 1937 Royal as available in ten body types, starting at US$715 ($ in dollars ), with the four door sedan at US$815 ($ in dollars ). The 1937 Royal Series C-16 was installed with the Chrysler Straight Six and took the entry-level position in the Chrysler hierarchy, while being shared with the DeSoto Airstream. In 1939 the Series C-22 Royal introduced the &quot;Royal Windsor&quot; nameplate as a trim package, then in 1941, the &quot;Royal&quot;, &quot;Windsor&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot; became separate nameplates sharing the same wheelbase but only using the Straight Six, with &quot;Windsor&quot; models offering more standard features and a higher standard interior over the &quot;Royal&quot;.

1948 models built after 1 December 1948 were officially designated as First Series 1949 models.

The Royal replaced the Chrysler Six that the company originated with in 1925, and the Royal remained the 6-cylinder entry-level model for Chrysler until it was dropped at the end of 1950 model year, making the Chrysler Windsor the entry-level car for the 1951 model year. Pre-war models were offered in two wheelbase lengths, with coupes and sedans available on the shorter wheelbase, while seven-passenger sedan and limousine were offered on the longer wheelbase. While it was the most affordable Chrysler, it was still a well equipped car with luxurious attention to detail as it was above DeSoto Custom, Dodge Custom and Plymouth De Luxe.

==Later use of the Royal name by Chrysler==
The Royal name was revived by Chrysler Australia in 1957 for an Australian produced model based on the 1953 Plymouth. The &quot;royal&quot; model name was also revived for the 1955 North American Dodge Royal.

The name was later applied as a trim level of the Chrysler Newport from 1970 to 1972; It was also used on Dodge Ram pickup trucks and vans until the early 1990s.

<doc id="684842" wikidata="Q1241670" url="?curid=684842" title="Invisible theater">
<text>Invisible theatre is a form of theatrical performance that is enacted in a place where people would not normally expect to see one, for example in the street or in a shopping centre. Performers disguise the fact that it is a performance from those who observe and who may choose to participate in it, thus leading spectators to view it as a real, unstaged event.

The Brazilian theater practitioner Augusto Boal and Panagiotis Assimakopoulos developed the form during their time in Argentina in the 1960s as part of Boal&#x27;s Theatre of the Oppressed, which focused on oppression and social issues. Invisible theatre developed in the context of increasingly repressive dictatorship in Brazil and Argentina. The purpose of invisible theatre was to show oppression in everyday life, in an everyday setting, without the audience or &quot;spect-actors&quot; knowing. Boal went on to develop forum theater.

==Invisible theatre in Argentina==
Invisible theatre was developed in Buenos Aires as public and participatory action that avoided police authority. The Brazilian Augusto Boal was in exile in Argentina from 1971 to 1976 and created his first invisible theatre experiment in collaboration with a group of actors. The performance took place in a busy restaurant at lunchtime, with actors sitting at different tables. One actor ordered &quot;à la carte&quot;, but at the end of the lunch told the waiter that he could not pay the 70 soles. He offered to pay with his labour and asked the waiter how much he would get paid taking out the rubbish. Another actor, seated at another table, informed the customers that a rubbish collector gets paid 7 sole per hour. Yet another actor, at yet another table, told everyone that a gardener gets 10 soles per hour. Eventually another member of the cast started to collect money from the restaurant customers to pay the bill.

Boal took theatre to an audience who did not recognise that they were the audience; he argued it was critical that actors participating in the invisible theatre did not reveal that they were actors. In its early phase, invisible theatre aimed to raise public awareness of class differences and to provide a forum for articulating dissent.

== Invisible theatre in Europe ==
In the late 1970s and the early 1980s Boal staged invisible theatre performances in Sicily, Stockholm, Paris and other European cities, in public locations like the Paris Metro and on Stockholm ferries. These performances tackled issues such as racism, ageism, sexism and homelessness.

== Invisible theatre in Brazil ==
When Boal returned to Brazil in 1986, he produced a weekly invisible theatre for a Rio TV station. In one episode a dark-skinned man sold himself as a slave in the market, informing the crowd that he earned less than a 19th-century slave.

==Comparison to happenings==
Historically, invisible theatre developed after happenings had been staged in Argentina by Oscar Mosatta. Mosatta had staged happenings in the late 1960s after he had attended such performances in New York in 1966. While happenings are also used to raise awareness about an issue, take place outside a theatre or gallery, and are scripted, the audience is aware that they are attending a happening. Boal states in &quot;Tecnicas latinoamericanas de teatro popular&quot; that invisible theater and happenings are distinct: &quot;El teatro invisible no debe ser confundido con el happening, que es un hecho teatral insólito, caótico, en que todo puede ocurrir, anárquicamente.&quot; [&quot;Invisible theater must not be confused with the happening, which is an unusual theatrical event, chaotic, in which anything can occur, anarchically.&quot;]

<doc id="684843" wikidata="Q1726843" url="?curid=684843" title="Shai Hulud">
<text>Shai Hulud is an American metalcore band formed in Pompano Beach, Florida, in 1995, and later based in Poughkeepsie, New York. The band is named after the giant sandworms in Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;Dune&quot;.

The two mainstay members of Shai Hulud are considered to be Matt Fox (guitar), who writes most of the band&#x27;s musical and lyrical output, and Matt Fletcher (originally guitar, now bass), who assists in writing.

==History==
===Early years (1995–1997)===
Matt Fox (guitar) and Dave Silber (bass) formed Shai Hulud in 1995 with Damien Moyal (formerly of Culture) on vocals, Jason Lederman on drums, and Oliver Chapoy on guitar. &quot;Matt was playing in several other kinds of bands like rock bands and they just wanted to play some hardcore&quot; says former bassist Jared Allen. However, things with Jason Lederman didn&#x27;t work out and the band began to look for a new drummer. This, unfortunately, would be something the band would become accustomed to. In 1994, Steve Kleisath and Matt Fox met for the first time in Tampa, FL, when Matt was filling in on drums for Strongarm, the band Steve later joined as drummer. With a complete lineup intact, the band recorded a six-song demo and was soon signed to Revelation Records by Rob Moran, bass player of Unbroken, who received their demo from Jeanne Probart, a friend that worked in Revelation&#x27;s mail-order department. Although Revelation loved the Shai Hulud demo, they asked the band to change the name because they thought &quot;it was too difficult to remember&quot;. Shai Hulud&#x27;s first show was a Halloween party, played on October 31, 1995, at Discount&#x27;s warehouse for under 50 people.

Moyal quit the band shortly after the band signed to Revelation Records in early 1996 and went on to play in Morning Again, Bird of Ill Omen and As Friends Rust. With Moyal&#x27;s exit, Shai Hulud recruited fourteen year old Chad Gilbert on vocals; Gilbert had been recommended by Moyal at the time of his departure. The band had a record deal with Revelation Records&#x27; subsidiary, Crisis Records. In September 1996, they recorded a three-song EP called &quot;A Profound Hatred Of Man&quot; which was released in February 1997. On the first 5000 copies of their debut EP, the band&#x27;s name is misspelled on the spine as, &quot;Shai Halud&quot;, but spelled correctly on the cover. This EP started the legacy of Shai Hulud.

===&quot;Hearts Once Nourished with Hope and Compassion&quot; (1997–2003)===
Chad Gilbert departed to found the pop punk band New Found Glory in 1997. This would pose problems for Shai Hulud in the future. However, they started recording their first full-length, &quot;Hearts Once Nourished with Hope and Compassion&quot;, in August 1997. They would finish the album in September and release it in November. Throughout the next year and a half Shai Hulud toured America with Strongarm, Bloodlet, Shadows Fall, Zao, Overcast, Cannibal Corpse and Disembodied. A limited edition vinyl of the album was released in 2006, and featured a cover painting by Dan Henk.

In May 1998 three tracks were recorded for a split with New York&#x27;s Indecision entitled &quot;The Fall of Every Man&quot;. The split was released in November 1998. As Shai Hulud&#x27;s popularity grew some of the band&#x27;s members&#x27; interest began to wane. In January 1999, Oliver Chapoy decided to leave the band. He was replaced by Matthew Fletcher who later moved to Florida to join the band in February 1999. Matt Fletcher had seen Shai Hulud for the first time in Seattle, Washington in 1997 with Strongarm and NineIronSpitFire. Andrew Gormley (future Shai Hulud drummer) was also at the show selling Kiss It Goodbye demos. Poison the Well drummer Chris Hornbrook filled in for a single show in February 1999 before Gormley joined. In June 1999, they recorded a cover of &quot;Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; for the Bad Brains tribute compilation called &quot;Never Give In&quot;.

Steve Kleisath quit the band due to personal issues, and Chad Gilbert decided to leave Shai Hulud and become a full-time guitar player for the band New Found Glory. The band forged ahead and recruited Andrew Gormley to fill in as drummer on a European tour. Matt Fletcher filled in as singer until Geert van der Velde joined the band during the tour. The band returned to Florida determined to continue Shai Hulud. However, Dave Silber had been ready to quit and did so upon their return. In January 2000, Jared Allen, Matt Fletcher&#x27;s friend from Oklahoma, would fill in the bass player position and quickly joined the band in the studio. Three tracks would be recorded for a split with the band Another Victim named &quot;A Whole New Level of Sickness&quot;. This and another split, honoring Metallica, were both released in March 2000. Shai Hulud shared the Metallica tribute split, named &quot;Crush &#x27;Em All Vol. 1&quot;, with Boy Sets Fire, covering the song Damage Inc. Spikey Goldbach would fill in as drummer for the &quot;A Whole New Level Of Sickness&quot; split and Steve Kleisath would return for the sole track on the &quot;Crush &#x27;Em All Vol. 1&quot; split for Undecided Records. In April 2000, the band relocated to Poughkeepsie, NY. Chris Cardinal, who used to play for Inner Dam, joined the band to fill in on drums, but he later decided to leave the band.

===&quot;That Within Blood Ill-Tempered&quot; (2003–2006)===

In 2002, Jared Allen decided to leave the band, and Matt Fletcher moved on to bass. The band recorded a second full-length &quot;That Within Blood Ill-Tempered&quot;, released on May 20, 2003. The album peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart, without any video or radio airplay. Throughout the creation of the new album, the band continued to search for a permanent drummer. Tony Tintari joined the band in the studio while recording the new album. 
After the release of &quot;That Within Blood Ill-Tempered&quot;, Shai Hulud picked up guitarist Matt Canning and embarked on a number of international tours. After some time, Shai Hulud and vocalist Geert van der Velde mutually decided it was for the best he leave the band. Geert left and soon thereafter started his solo project The Black Atlantic, and to join as vocalist for the metalcore band Miscreants. Drummer Tony Tintari left the band to join the indie rock band Holy Roman Empire. Guitarist Matt Canning left the band to start The Twilight Collective. Andrew Gormley rejoined on drums for some time and the band played a series of shows with Chad Gilbert on vocals before taking a hiatus to regroup.
Acknowledging some people may misinterpret the parting as the end of Shai Hulud, the band came out on their homepage indicating that they would not be breaking up; instead, the band would change name to &quot;The Warmth of Red Blood&quot; and continue what had been started with Shai Hulud. They started requesting that anyone who considered themselves up for the challenge of taking over vocal duties record a demo of themselves performing the track &quot;Whether to Cry or Destroy&quot; (quite similar to what The Dillinger Escape Plan did when auditioning new vocalists). In 2005, the band co-released (via their own record label At Dawn We Wage War Records and Revelation Records) a retrospective release entitled, &quot;A Comprehensive Retrospective: or How We Learned to Stop Worrying and Release Bad and Useless Recordings&quot; containing rare demos and live tracks!

===&quot;Misanthropy Pure&quot; (2006–2009)===
In early 2006, the band recorded a three song rough demo with Eric Dellon on lead vocals and drums, featuring former vocalist Geert van der Velde on backup vocals. In March 2006, the band announced they were abandoning the moniker &quot;The Warmth of Red Blood&quot; and keeping the name Shai Hulud. In August 2006, the band signed with Metal Blade Records. The band recorded their third full-length album &quot;Misanthropy Pure&quot; at Silver Bullet Media in Connecticut with Matt Mazzali on vocals and Andrew Gormley on drums; the album features additional vocalists such as J Costa of Thy Will Be Done. Released on May 27, 2008, the album peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Top Independent albums chart and 15 on the Top Heatseekers chart. For a number of months, Shai Hulud enlisted the help of former Unearth &amp; The Red Chord drummer Mike Justain up until he joined the band Trap Them. The position of second guitar was filled by Chad Kishick of Miami, Florida, until 2009 when he left the band. Geert Van der Velde temporally returned as vocalist for the band for the 2009 Japan tour, with Parkway Drive and Crystal Lake.

The band released a split EP with New Found Glory titled &quot;Not Without a Heart Once Nourished by Sticks and Stones Within Blood Ill-Tempered Misanthropy Pure Gold Can Stay&quot; being sold only at the &quot;Not Without a Fight&quot; tour. There are two colors limited to a total of only 500 copies and only for sale from either Shai Hulud or New Found Glory at these shows.

===&quot;Reach Beyond the Sun&quot; (2011–present)===
On January 26, 2011, the band announced that they would embark on a 17-day US tour, beginning on the February 2, 2011 to the 19. Shai Hulud is currently in the studio recording a new album. Which is being produced by former vocalist and guitarist of New Found Glory: Chad Gilbert. More recently, August 9, 2012, the band has been announced as an artist touring Australia as part of the annual Soundwave Festival. Details on who will be performing vocals for this tour have yet to be released. They will complete the Australian tour with the festival in early to mid March 2013. The band has also expressed interest in completing as many Sidewaves as possible, shows which would see them play in smaller and more personal venues than the festival itself. Along with this comes a statement via Facebook suggesting that they will be returning to Australia once again, after this festival has been completed, perhaps for the launch tour of their forthcoming album. On September 13, 2012, Matt Fox announced that not only did former member Chad Gilbert produce their forthcoming album, he also supplied the vocals for it as well. On November 19, the band announced the new album&#x27;s name, &quot;Reach Beyond the Sun&quot; and a 30-second teaser on YouTube. In December 2015, the band released an EP entitled &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Hate Enough&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Genre===
The band is known within the hardcore scene for their affecting, well-written lyrics, whose themes range from misanthropy, hatred, human psychology to hope and compassion, and their often complex compositions, utilizing elements of hardcore punk, heavy, thrash and progressive metal.

Shai Hulud was one of the first hardcore/metal crossover band that used the term &quot;metalcore&quot; to describe their music (as shown in the back cover of &quot;That Within Blood Ill-Tempered&quot;) and by some fans the band is still considered to be &quot;a true metalcore band&quot;, while others, including band members have discarded the term due to their current meaning, e.g., the melodic death metal influenced metalcore, when this genre became a commercial success in early 2000s as &quot;metalcore&quot; and it differed from what the band was playing at that time.

In a more recent interview Fox stated that &quot;progressive hardcore&quot; was the best way to describe the band, rather that stick to a one specific genre.

===Influences and legacy===
They cite their influences as Raw Power, Burn, Chain of Strength, Deadguy, J.F.A., Metallica, NOFX, S.F.A., Strongarm, Testament, Turning Point, Embodiment 12:14, Uniform Choice and Voivod.

Shai Hulud has become a very influential band in the underground hardcore, metalcore and post-hardcore scene. Bands like 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Alove for Enemies, As Hope Dies, As I Lay Dying, Behind Crimson Eyes, It Prevails, Many Men Have Tried, Misery Signals, Mychildren Mybride, Poison the Well, See You Next Tuesday, Silverstein, the Funeral Pyre, the Banner and Unearth, have cited Shai Hulud as an influence.

===Religion and beliefs===
Shai Hulud is neither a Christian band nor straight edge, as stated by the band:

==Side projects==
===Zombie Apocalypse===
Shai Hulud also have a side project named Zombie Apocalypse (formerly called Boddicker), whose sound can be summed up as a faster, more chaotic and more manic version of its mother band. It features Matt Fox, Matthew Fletcher, Ronen Kaufman, Eric Dellon and Greg Thomas.

===The Fremen Warriors===

The Fremen Warriors (another reference to Dune) are a group who provide the backing vocals on all of Shai Hulud&#x27;s releases. Their names are not listed in any of the liner notes, but on the song &quot;Faithless Is He Who Says Farewell When The Road Darkens,&quot; they consisted of Aaron Bedard, Nick Brunson, Nicole Prizio, Kelly Reaves, and Paul Romanko.

<text>Peter des Roches (died 9 June 1238) (Latinised as &quot;Petrus de Rupibus&quot; (&quot;Peter from the rocks&quot;)) was bishop of Winchester in the reigns of King John of England and his son Henry III. He was not an Englishman, but rather a native of the Touraine, in north-central France.

==Biography==
Towards the end of Richard I&#x27;s reign, Peter became Lord Chamberlain and an influential counsellor. He held the ecclesiastical offices of Archdeacon of Poitiers, treasurer of Poitiers, and was a precentor of the diocese of Lincoln in 1204.

In early 1205, through John&#x27;s influence, Peter was elected to the see of Winchester. His election was disputed but, on appeal, confirmed on 25 September 1205 by Pope Innocent III. Peter was consecrated on 24 March 1206. Nonetheless, the new bishop stood by John&#x27;s side during the whole period of the papal interdict set upon him due to John&#x27;s refusal to accept Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury despite Papal warning.

In 1213 Peter was made Chief Justiciar in succession to Geoffrey Fitz Peter. This promotion was justified by the fidelity with which Peter supported the king through the First Barons&#x27; War. However, by 1215, Hubert de Burgh was Chief Justiciar. In 1216, Peter was named Sheriff of Hampshire.

At the battle of Lincoln in 1217 Peter led a division of the royal army and earned some distinction by his valour; but he played a secondary part in the government so long as William Marshal held the regency. After Marshal&#x27;s death in 1219 Peter led the baronial opposition to Hubert de Burgh, with varying success. At first the justiciar was successful.

Peter was responsible for founding several monasteries in England and France, including Titchfield Abbey and Netley Abbey, both in Hampshire, England, and La Clarté-Dieu in Poitou, France. He gave his protection to the first group of Dominican friars to come to England in 1221.

In 1225 a plot to ship Eleanor of Brittany, who as cousin to Henry III always posed a potential threat to the crown and was thus viewed as a state prisoner and then confined at Bristol Castle, away to France, was reported. The plot might have been false and only fabricated to discredit Peter, and he eventually fell out of royal favor in spring 1234.

===Crusading bishop===

Peter participated in the Sixth Crusade alongside William Briwere, who was Bishop of Exeter. An army of other crusaders accompanied them to the East, although whether they were English or mercenaries recruited on the Continent is unclear. The contingent left from Brindisi in August 1227. Both bishops were influential advisors to Frederick II the Holy Roman Emperor even though Pope Gregory IX had ordered that no one collaborate with Frederick, who was at the time excommunicated. Both bishops ignored the papal orders and worked closely with Frederick&#x27;s agents and Frederick himself. The financial resources both bishops brought were especially appreciated by the crusaders. On the 18th of February 1229, both bishops were witnesses at the Treaty of Jaffa which restored Jerusalem to the Christians. After the crusade, he spent time in Italy.

On July 30th 1232 Hubert de Burgh was overthrown by the action of Peter des Roches who then became the chief minister of Henry III. Full details can be found in &quot;Henry III&quot; by David Carpenter.

Peter died on 9 June 1238.

==Legends==
The Lanercost Chronicle relates that Peter, out hunting one day, encountered King Arthur, dined with him, and asked for a token of their meeting. Arthur told him to close his hand, then open it, whereupon a butterfly flew out. For the rest of his life Roches was able to repeat this miracle, so that he became known as the Butterfly Bishop.

<text>The Comando Jaramillista Morelense of May 23 (shortened &quot;CJ23M&quot;) is a rebel group in Mexico, attached to agrarian and leftist thoughts, taking the name of the agrarian leader and militar Rubén Jaramillo. His operation is a classic armed propaganda action that fulfilled one objective: to disseminate the existence of the command and its ideology. An initiative carried out at a time of profound political decomposition in the rest of the country, preceded by the making of paintings that gave account of the existence of the group in different parts of the states of Morelos.

==History==
CJM took the name of Rubén Jaramillo, who was associated with a Zapatist movement in the 1940s and 1950s and was murdered on May 23, 1962. The bombings were a tribute to Jaramillio and carried out because CJM claimed to be against the corruption of government leaders; in particular, Sergio Estrada Cajigal (governor of Morelos) and President Vicente Fox. The group claims Estrada Cagijal is involved in drug trafficking and runs a corrupt and repressive government. The CJM claims not to be terrorists, but anti-government, and have stated they have no interest in harming civilians – one of the reasons why the bombing was on a Sunday (when the banks were closed and few people were about). The group was founded on May 24, 2004, where their first communiqué came out, claiming their first attack, taking the demands of Rubén Jaramillo as an ideological basis and &quot;strengthening their legacy&quot;.

Between May 23, 2004, and May 23, 2009, the group issued nineteen &quot;Comunicados&quot; expressing their support of socialism and their opposition to &quot;neoliberalism&quot; without expressing specific demands. A similarly named group, &quot;Comando Jaramillista de la Region Oriente,&quot; issued a &quot;Comunicado&quot; in Oaxaca on November 11, 2004. Over the years there have been other armed groups in the State of Morelos. Besides the rebellions led by Ruben Jaramillo, the &quot;Partido Proletario Unido de América&quot; flourished in 1974. More recently, the Popular Revolutionary Army and Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias del Pueblo (People&#x27;s Armed Revolutionary Forces) have been active.

The group is against the establishment of Neoliberalism in the country, especially during the final stretch of the presidency of Vicente Fox, in addition to being active during the 2006 elections, blaming the Partido Acción Nacional and the Partido Revolucionario Institucional and Partido Verde Ecologista de Mexico for the economic stagnation of the country. The attack took place a few days after the start of the III Summit of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, which will be held in Guadalajara. The group also threatens to reactivate its military activity in the event that the elections are &quot;a fix&quot; calling the process as a &quot;sacrifice of hundreds of revolutionaries and social fighters who lost their lives and freedom for the sake of a free, dignified and fair to all &quot;. It also calls for the union of the various political and social organizations either from underground and from all perspectives (whether liberal, democratic, progressive, revolutionary, socialist, etc.)

The group also came to tie with the candidacy of Andrés Manuel López Obrador and notable peaceful civil movements during the 2006 elections, in addition to showing solidarity with the Bolivarian Revolution. The group calls for &quot;resistance to be found in the defense and democratic transformation&quot; of republican institutions and, consequently, in the reconstitution of the State and the Nation, as well as the members of The Other Campaign.

The May 15, 2004, the Federal Government and the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación signed the Alliance for the Quality of Education, an agreement that seeks to transform the model education through public policies that promote higher quality and equity in education in the country. But this measure was received with hostility by some sectors of the teaching profession, provoking demonstrations, for supposedly affecting their labor rights. The group sympathized with these protests, describing the repression. The group also opposed the Lerma-Tres Marías highway projects, northwestern bypass and the Proyecyo siglo 21 with the highway of the sun. On May 23, 2009 the group released its statement number 19 in which they show their sympathy for various political and social movements that had suffered &quot;persecution&quot; by the government of Felipe Calderón Hinojosa. CJ23M only recently became a vocal group; prior activity is unheard of in the region.

==Attacks==
===Banamex attack===
The May 24 CJM-23 claimed responsibility for the detonation of three devices in the bank branches and a fourth device that was found without exploding in a branch of Banamex, Bancomer, Santander Serfin and HSBC, in the city of Jiutepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos. The group also claimed to have placed an offering on the bust of Rubén Jaramillo, located in the city of Jiutepec. The attack was carried out in commemoration of the death of Rubén Jaramillo, in addition to strongly criticizing the government of Vicente Fox and the governor of the state of Morelos, Sergio Estrada Cajigal accusing his administration of corrupt and inefficient. The attacks said they were carried out against the corruption of government leaders Sergio Alberto Estrada Cajigal Ramírez, governor of Morelos and Vicente Fox.

===Other incidents===
In the following communiqués, they spoke about the death of indigenous activists such as Gregorio Sánchez Mercado, in the state of Guerrero and Pavel Gonzalez in Mexico City, in addition to accusing the neoliberal system of &quot;impoverishing indigenous organizations.&quot; The group also criticizes the presidency of Vicente Fox and in addition to the economic and social policies that were developed during the government of the PAN and the PRI.

The October 23, 2005, a Improvised explosive device detonated in front of a branch of BBVA in the municipality of Temixco, Morelos, causing material damage to other establishments within a 30-meter radius and leaving an attacker with minor injuries. Another explosive was also deactivated and two people were arrested, but released the next day.

The group claimed responsibility for the attack, however, the authorities investigated the incident, and came to the conclusion this was a lie.

<doc id="684847" wikidata="Q67452" url="?curid=684847" title="Alexander Huber">
<text>Alexander Huber (born 30 December 1968) is a German rock climber who is considered one of the greatest and most influential climbers in the history of rock climbing. Huber came to prominence in the early 1990s as the world&#x27;s strongest sport climber after the passing of Wolfgang Güllich. He is the second-ever person to redpoint a graded route by ascending &quot;Om&quot; in 1992, and has come to be known as the first-ever person to redpoint a graded route from his 1996 ascent of &quot;&quot;.

For a decade following the mid-1990s, Huber, often partnered with his brother Thomas, also came to be regarded as the strongest big wall free climber of his generation, with groundbreaking first ascents in Yosemite (&quot;El Nino&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Zodiac&quot; in 2003), the Karakoram (Latok II in 1997, and &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; in 2009), and in other notable big wall locations around the world. Huber’s 1995 ascent of the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot; in Yosemite was the first-ever redpoint of an graded big wall in history. His 2001 ascent of &quot;&quot; in the Dolomites was the first-ever redpoint of an graded big wall in history.

Huber is also known as one of the greatest free solo climbers for both big wall and sport climbing routes. In 2002, he free soloed the first-ever grade big wall in history, the 580-metre &quot;Brandler-Hasse Direttissima&quot; in the Dolomites. In 2003, he free soloed the second-ever grade sport climbing route in history with &quot;Der Opportunist&quot; in Austria, and in 2004, he became the first-ever person in history to free solo an graded sport route with &quot;Kommunist&quot;, also in Austria.

==Early life and education==

Huber was born in Trostberg in Bavaria, the second of three children. His father Thomas, a climber who had ascended the north face of Les Droites, and his mother Maria, took the children mountaineering from a young age. By 1986, aged 18, Huber and his brother Thomas climb &quot;Utopia&quot; (VIII+, 7a+) on the Wartsteinwand, and in 1988, they ascend &quot;Vom Winde Verweht&quot; (X−, 8a+) on Scharnstein in the Berchtesgaden Alps.

By 1992, Huber trained as a fully qualified UIAGM mountain guide. In 1997, Huber graduated with a Master&#x27;s in Physics and received a post-graduate position as an assistant at the Institute for Theoretical Meteorology in the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1998, Huber decided to become a full-time professional climber, one year after Thomas; the pair are known as the &quot;Huberbuam&quot; (Huberboys).

==Climbing career==

===Sport climbing===

Huber came to prominence as a sport climber in the early 1990s, at a time when Wolfgang Gullich was considered the world&#x27;s strongest sport climber. Huber attributes the initial conservative grading of Gullich&#x27;s famous 1991 route, &quot;Action Directe&quot;, which persisted for many years until it was eventually shown to be a &quot;hard 9a&quot;, for suppressing the grades of Huber&#x27;s own routes such as &quot;Om&quot;, &quot;Weisse Rose&quot;, and &quot;La Rambla&quot;. In 2008, when Adam Ondra made the first repeat of Huber&#x27;s 1996 route &quot;&quot; and graded it , that the climbing media began to realize that Huber was probably the first-ever person to climb at that grade, several years before Chris Sharma&#x27;s groundbreaking ascent of &quot;Realization&quot; in 2001. Huber felt that &quot;Open Air&quot; was his limit, and he decided to focus on big wall climbing.

===Big wall climbing===

From the mid-1990s onwards, Huber (often partnered with Thomas), began to focus almost exclusively on big wall climbing in which he would become one of the most important big wall free climbers in history. In 1995, Huber became the first person to lead all 36-pitches of the &quot;Salathé Wall&quot;, and thus became the first-ever person to redpoint a big wall route at the grade of . Over the following decade, Huber made the first free ascent (or partial free ascent with minor aid), some of the most iconic big wall routes in Yosemite, including &quot;El Nino&quot; (5.13c A0, 1998), &quot;Golden Gate&quot; (5.13a, 2000), &quot; El Corazon&quot; (5.13b, 2001), and &quot; Zodiac&quot; (5.13d, 2003). Huber&#x27;s most famous Yosemite route was his easiest, his 1998 ascent of &quot;Freerider&quot; (5.12d/5.13a), a route which is only second in popularity to &quot;The Nose&quot;. The Huber brothers set several Yosemite speed records including a speed record for &quot;The Nose&quot; of 2:45.45, in 2007.

In 2001, Huber made the first free ascent of &#x27; through the huge roofs of the north face of Cima Ovest in the Dolomites (the birthplace of big wall climbing), which was the world&#x27;s first-ever big wall route at the grade . In 2005, Huber freed the famous &#x27;, the hardest big wall route in the French Alps at the time at , and in 2007, he returned to the Cima Ovest to free the route &quot;&quot;, also at . During this period, Huber also made important big wall ascents in the Karakoram (&quot;Tsering Mosong&quot; on Latok II, 1997), in Patagonia (&quot;Golden Eagle&quot; in 2006 and &quot;El Bastardo&quot; in 2008, on Fitz Roy), in Antarctica (&quot;Sound of Silence&quot; on Ulvetanna Peak, 2008), and on Baffin Island (&quot;Bavarian Direct&quot; on Mount Asgard, 2012). In 2009, Huber and his brother Thomas freed the famous high-altitude big wall route, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; (5.13a), on the Nameless Tower in Pakistan.

===Free solo climbing===

Huber has made some of the most important free solo climbing ascents in history. In 2002, Huber free soloed at 17-pitches of the 580-metre &quot;Brandler-Hasse Direttissima&quot; (5.12a) on the Cima Grande in the Dolomites, which was the first-ever free solo of a graded big wall route in history. In 2003, he free soloed the sport climbing route, &quot;Der Opportunist&quot; in Austria, which was only the second-ever free solo of an graded route in history. In 2004, Huber free soloed &quot;Kommunist&quot; in Austria, which was the first-ever free solo of an graded route in history; Huber called this solo a &quot;search for my limits&quot;. Huber said that after his 2008 free solo of the multi-pitch 280-metre route &quot;Locker Vom Hocker&quot; , he largely stopped doing free solo climbs at very extreme grades saying: &quot;You mustn&#x27;t forget that free soloing is very, very risky indeed. Even for the best climbers who seemingly have everything under control&quot;.

==Notable climbs==

===Sport climbing===

Huber was considered one of the world&#x27;s best sport climbers.

===High-altitude climbing===
Huber took part in several expeditions to famous big wall climbing locations including the high-altitude walls of Trango Tower, the stormy towers of Patagonia, and the extreme-cold of Ulvetanna in Antarctica; climbing usually with his brother Thomas, but also often part of a larger climbing team in an alpine style approach:

<text>National Development Plan (NDP, ) is the title given by the Irish Government to a scheme of organised large-scale expenditure on (mainly) national infrastructure. The first five-year plan ran from 1988 to 1993, the second was a six-year plan from 1994 to 1999 and the third ran as a seven-year plan from 2000 to 2006. A fourth National Development Plan ran from 2007 to 2011 (spending €70 million a day every day during this period). The main elements of the third plan were the development of a national motorway network between the major cities in Ireland. The upgrading of the rail network was a secondary scheme.

The ESRI conducted a review of the latest NDP in 2023.

==Achievements==

===Road network===


By the start of 2009 substantial progress had been made on the motorway network, with all sections of the five major inter-urban motorways either under construction or complete. The M1 motorway from Dublin towards Belfast has been completed as far as the border with Northern Ireland. The last section of N1/M1 route to be completed was the motorway/dual carriageway upgrade that crossed the border to become an upgraded A1 route as far as Newry. This was the first cross-border road project and was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007, thus completing the N1/M1 route.

The N7/M7 motorway from Dublin to Limerick was completed in 2010. Major work was undertaken to extend the motorway westwards from Portlaoise to Limerick from 2006 onwards when work on the Nenagh to Limerick section commenced. Construction commenced on the Portlaoise to Castletown section in 2007 while work commenced on the Castletown to Nenagh section in 2008. All sections were completed at various times in 2010. Other upgrades during this period include the Naas road upgrade, which was finished in August 2006. This involved the widening of a section of the route to three lanes in each direction and the removal of several at-grade junctions.

The M4/N4 from Dublin towards Sligo (and providing the link to the N6/M6 for Galway) now reaches as far as the Midlands. By September 2008, the M6 motorway was contiguous from Kinnegad to Athlone. The rest of the M6 route was completed in 2009 as far as Galway (where it will tie in with the proposed M17/M18 schemes). All sections of the M9 motorway to Waterford are also completed. The M9 Carlow bypass element opened in May 2008, while the Waterford-Knocktopher scheme opened in 2010. The M8 Dublin-Cork road motorway moved substantially towards completion in 2008 with the opening of the 37 km Cashel-Mitchelstown scheme and the redesignation of the Cashel bypass to motorway standard. In December 2008, the 40 km M8 Cullahill-Cashel scheme was opened to traffic. All other sections of this route were under construction by late 2007. The 16 km Fermoy to Mitchelstown segment opened to traffic on 25 May 2009. The M8 was completed in 2010 following the opening of the M7/M8 Portlaoise to Castletown/Cullahill route where the M8 intersects with the M7. The N11/M11 is also receiving upgrades along with the new controversial 47 km M3 motorway.

In 2010, upgrade works the now-complete M50 motorway Dublin inner ring road were finalised. The upgrade of parts of the M50 was appended to the NDP. One of the upgrades was the M50 Dublin Port Tunnel project which was a major scheme involving tunnelling from the M1 north of the city centre, through to the Docklands to the east of the city centre. The tunnel was officially opened by the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, on 20 December 2006. Other upgrades included the changing of the N4/M50 to a free-flow layout and an upgrade of the motorway to three or four lanes in each direction between many junctions. Works to upgrade the N7/M50 and M1/M50 junctions to free-flow or near free-flow layouts, and to upgrade the rest of the route to three or four-lane motorway were completed in late 2009 and during 2010.

By early 2009, some progress had been made on the Atlantic Corridor, which aims to link Letterkenny to Waterford, via upgrades of the N15, N17, N18, N20 and N25. The upgrade would have seen dual-carriageway/motorway links between Letterkenny and Sligo, Sligo and Galway, Galway and Limerick, Limerick and Cork and Cork and Waterford. In November 2008 work commenced on the 22 km section of the N18 HQDC from Crusheen to Gort. Various other sections of the route are planning stages. The M20 Cork-Limerick route is at public consultation stage and an EIS and motorway order are due to be published around April next year. The M17 from Galway to Tuam, along with the M18 from Gort (which ties in with the aforementioned M17) were completed in 2017. The N25 Waterford City bypass was completed on 19 October 2009, 10 months ahead of schedule. The N25 New Ross bypass was opened in January 2020.

===Rail network===

Dublin suburban routes benefited from large amounts of new rolling stock, in the form of suburban railcars. These operate north to Dundalk, northwest to Maynooth, southwest to Portlaoise and south to Gorey. The electrified section of the north–south route through Dublin had extra EMUs brought into service. Dublin also saw the opening of a new tram system, the Luas in 2004.

Major projects undertaken were the upgrade of Heuston Station in Dublin to nine platforms and the new railcar servicing depot in Drogheda. Many other stations, particularly the Dublin suburban stations, were upgraded and modernised, with lifts for example on new footbridges. Other measures to improve disabled access were implemented, and park and ride facilities were developed.

InterCity travel benefited from new suburban railcars freeing up InterCity rolling stock previously in use. 67 new locomotive-hauled InterCity carriages were introduced in 2006. Over 100 &quot;regional railcars&quot; were ordered, in the form DMUs currently in use on peripheral services that are not commuter-only. Services were increased on routes such as that from Limerick to Ennis.

Planned developments included enhancing suburban rail in Cork, where a section of rail was reopened to Midleton, east of the city. Other projects under discussion, some or all of which are unlikely to be undertaken, include:
*A railway line from Dublin to Navan.
*Developing a rail link to Dublin Airport (possibly as an underground Metro link).
*Opening a new city centre railway terminus for Sligo and western commuter services at Spencer Dock.
*Creating the DART Underground tunnel south from the Docklands railway station in Spencer Dock to Pearse Station and west to Heuston Station.
*Reopening a Western Railway Corridor from Limerick to Sligo. The section from Ennis to Athenry was reopened in 2010, with the sections from Athenry to Tuam, as well as preserving right of way north of Tuam, cancelled indefinitely in 2011.
* Reopening of Limerick-Tralee and Athlone-Mullingar railway lines.

<doc id="684854" wikidata="Q78510" url="?curid=684854" title="Walter Kohn">
<text>Walter Kohn (; March 9, 1923 – April 19, 2016) was an Austrian-American theoretical physicist and theoretical chemist.
He was awarded, with John Pople, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1998. The award recognized their contributions to the understandings of the electronic properties of materials. In particular, Kohn played the leading role in the development of density functional theory, which made it possible to calculate quantum mechanical electronic structure by equations involving the electronic density (rather than the many-body wavefunction). This computational simplification led to more accurate calculations on complex systems as well as many new insights, and it has become an essential tool for materials science, condensed-phase physics, and the chemical physics of atoms and molecules.

==Early years in Canada==
Kohn arrived in England as part of the Kindertransport rescue operation immediately after the annexation of Austria by Hitler. He was from a Jewish family, and has written, &quot;My feelings towards Austria, my native land, are – and will remain – very painful. They are dominated by my vivid recollections of 1 1/2 years as a Jewish boy under the Nazi regime, and by the subsequent murder of my parents, Salomon and Gittel Kohn, of other relatives and several teachers, during the Holocaust. ... I want to mention that I have a strong Jewish identity and – over the years – have been involved in several Jewish projects, such as the establishment of a strong program of Judaic Studies at the University of California in San Diego.&quot;. Kohn also has identified as Deist.

Because he was an Austrian national, he was transferred to Canada in July 1940 after the outbreak of World War II. As a 17-year-old, Kohn traveled as part of a British convoy moving through U-boat-infested waters to Quebec City in Canada; and from there, by train, to a camp in Trois-Rivières. He was at first held in detention in a camp near Sherbrooke, Quebec. This camp, as well as others, provided a small number of educational facilities that Kohn used to the fullest, and he finally succeeded in entering the University of Toronto. As a German national, the future Nobel Laureate in Chemistry was not allowed to enter the chemistry building, so he opted for physics and mathematics.

==Scientific career==
Kohn received a war-time bachelor&#x27;s degree in applied mathematics at the end of his one-year army service, having completed only 2½ out of the 4-year undergraduate program, from the University of Toronto in 1945; he was awarded an M.A. degree in applied mathematics by Toronto in 1946. Kohn was awarded a Ph.D. degree in physics by Harvard University in 1948, where he worked under Julian Schwinger on the three-body scattering problem. At Harvard, he also fell under the influence of J. H. Van Vleck and developed an interest in solid-state physics.

He moved from Harvard to Carnegie Mellon University from 1950 to 1960, after a short stint in Copenhagen as a National Research Council of Canada post-doctoral fellow. At Carnegie Mellon, he did much of his seminal work on multiple-scattering band-structure work, now known as the KKR method. His association with Bell Labs got him involved with semiconductor physics and produced a long and fruitful collaboration with Luttinger (including, for example, development of the Luttinger-Kohn model of semiconductor band structure). In 1960 he moved to the newly founded University of California, San Diego, held a term as the physics department chair, and remained until 1979. It was during this period, he, along with his student Chanchal Kumar Majumdar developed the &quot;Kohn–Majumdar theorem&quot; related to Fermi gas and its bound and unbound states. He then accepted the founding director&#x27;s position at the new Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara. He took his position as a professor in the Physics Department at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 1984; where he worked until the end of his life.

Kohn made significant contributions to semiconductor physics, which led to his award of the Oliver E. Buckley Prize by the American Physical Society. He was also awarded the Feenburg medal for his contributions to the many-body problem.
His work on density functional theory was initiated during a visit to the in Paris, with Pierre Hohenberg, and was prompted by a consideration of alloy theory. The
Hohenberg–Kohn theorem was further developed, in collaboration with Lu Jeu Sham, to produce the Kohn-Sham equations. The latter is the standard workhorse of modern materials science, and even used in quantum theories of plasmas.
In 2004, a study of all citations to the &quot;Physical Review&quot;  journals from 1893 until 2003, found Kohn to be an author of five of the 100 papers with the &quot;highest citation impact&quot;, including the first two.
In 1957, he relinquished his Canadian citizenship and became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

In 1963 Kohn became a Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1969, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1994. In 2011, he became an honorary member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW). He was also a Member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

==Death==
Kohn died on April 19, 2016, at his home in Santa Barbara, California from jaw cancer, at the age of 93.

<text>Uruguaiana is a municipality in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. It is located on the eastern shore of the Uruguay River
bordering Argentina. Opposite to Uruguaiana, and joined to it by a road/railway bridge, lies the Argentine city of Paso de los Libres, Corrientes. North of Uruguaiana lies the Brazilian municipality of Itaqui, connected by a bridge constructed by the British in 1888 over the Ibicuí River. The municipality also borders the municipalities of Alegrete, Barra do Quaraí and Quaraí, and, also, Uruguay, making it one of the few international triple-border municipalities of Brazil.

The city marks the southernmost point reached by the Paraguayans in the Paraguayan War; after being taken without resistance, it was recaptured after a six-week siege that effectively ended the phase of Paraguayan offensive operations.

Nowadays, Uruguaiana represents the biggest in population and arguably most important municipality of the sparsely populated western Rio Grande do Sul.

==Geography==
===Communications and distances===
The major highways connecting Uruguaiana with other cities in Rio Grande do Sul are BR 472, to Barra do Quaraí in the south and São Borja in the north, BR 290, to Alegrete and Porto Alegre in the east.

The city is served by Ruben Berta International Airport, the largest airport in the interior of the state. It had a traffic of over 3,000 passengers in 2008 with 1,409 planes using the facilities.

Some of the distances between Uruguaiana and other cities in the state are:
*Porto Alegre: 649 km.
*Santa Maria: 365 km.
*Pelotas: 649 km.
*Rio Grande: 701 km.
*Bagé: 454 km.
*Chuí: 904 km.
*Passo Fundo: 562 km.

===Climate===
Uruguaiana has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers and mild winters.

==Economy==
The economy is mainly based on services, followed by industry and agriculture in that order. The sectors employing the most workers were industry, 1,187 workers; commerce, 7,662 workers; public administration, 2,248 workers; transport, communications and storage, 3,303 workers; education, 573 workers; and health, 774 workers.

In 2006 there were 829 agricultural establishments, employing around 3,400 workers. There were 207,000 head of cattle. The main crops were soybeans (633 hectares), wheat (320 hectares), and rice (58,000 hectares).

==Health==
Health care for the population is mainly provided by public facilities. In 2005 there were 49 health establishments, of which 25 were public facilities. The Municipal Secretariat of Health and the Environment had 16 health centers, including the Health Center of Uruguaina and the Municipal Emergency Care operated by 235 workers.

Uruguaiana had two hospitals, both linked to the national health service. They had 268 beds (2005), with 176 public and 92 private.

==Education==
The municipal school network was made up of 27 schools, 10 urban and 17 rural, with 567 teachers who administered to 6,222 students in the urban area and 485 in the rural area. In the rural schools there were 30 teachers. The total number of schools both public and private was 110 in 2005. There were 52 primary schools, 4 middle schools, and 44 pre-primary schools in 2007.

Uruguaiana had a university campus with schools of Animal Science, Veterinarian Science, Agronomy, Philosophy, Letters, Accounting, Business Administration, Computer Science, and Law. Enrollment in 2005 was 1,850 students.

==Music==

Uruguaiana is the home of the yearly Califórnia da Canção Nativa regional gaucho music festival.

==Notable construction works==

International bridge

On May 21, 1947, the International Getúlio Vargas/Agustín P. Just Road/Railway Bridge on the Uruguay River was inaugurated by presidents Eurico Gaspar Dutra of Brazil and Juan Domingo Perón of Argentina, linking Uruguaiana to the Argentine city of Paso de los Libres. At the time of its construction, the bridge was the greatest work of engineering of South America.

Since 1994 there is a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) back-to-back station for power exchange with Argentina at Uruguaiana. This facility, which was built by Toshiba, can transfer a maximum power of 50 megawatts. The applied DC voltage is 15 kV.

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Uruguaiana.

==Consular representation==
Argentina has a Consulate in Uruguaiana.

<doc id="684859" wikidata="Q2638177" url="?curid=684859" title="N4 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N4 road is a national primary road in Ireland, running from Dublin to the northwest of Ireland and Sligo town. The M6 to Galway diverges from this route after Kinnegad, while the N5 to Westport diverges at Longford town. Most sections of the N4 that are motorway-standard are designated the M4 motorway.

==Road standard==
The N4 originates at an intersection with the M50 motorway at Junction 7. This is also Junction 1 of the N/M4. The Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is located at Junction 2. The road has three lanes and a bus lane in each direction between the M50 and Junction 5 which is also the start of the M4 motorway at Leixlip.

The N4 was the only one of the main inter-urban national routes whose dual-carriageway section continued into the city centre; however, the section inside the M50 was re-classified as the R148 in 2012.

Heading west, the PPP motorway section (see below) ends west of Kinnegad, and the motorway terminates 5  km further west; it continues as HQDC and bypasses Mullingar. From the Mullingar bypass to Edgeworthstown, the road is a wide single-carriageway with hard shoulders. Between Edgeworthstown and Longford, there is a lower standard single-carriageway road. Between Longford and Rooskey single carriageway continues at a higher standard. Dromod and Rooskey were bypassed in late 2007. This section of the road consists of three roundabouts and a Type 2 dual carriageway, i.e.: two lanes in each direction and no hard shoulder. The road resumes as a single carriageway with hard shoulders until it reaches Carrick-on-Shannon, where it becomes a local urban road through five roundabouts, and passes over the River Shannon into County Roscommon. The road becomes a high-quality single carriageway bypass 3  km outside of Boyle town, with periodic alternating overtaking lanes passing Lough Key Forest Park and Ballinafad until it reaches Castlebaldwin. From Castlebaldwin to Collooney the road is a Type 2 dual carriageway. Funding for the expansion of this section was announced in October 2018, and it opened in 2021. The road becomes near-motorway standard dual carriageway again at Collooney, approaching Sligo town.

==M4 motorway==
The section from Leixlip to the west of Kinnegad is the M4 motorway. The first section of this motorway (Leixlip – Kilcock) was opened on 19 December 1994.

===Tolled section of the M4 motorway===
Under the Government announcement of the pilot projects on 1 June 1999 this project was to be assessed by the NRA for its suitability to be advanced as a Public-private partnership (PPP). Subsequently, the project was included as one of the projects approved under Tranche II of the PPP Roads programme as announced by the NRA in June 2000. The project involved the construction of 39  km of motorway from Kinnegad to Kilcock and is an extension of the Kilcock-Maynooth-Leixlip motorway on the N4/N6 Sligo/Galway to Dublin route. The motorway bypasses the towns of Enfield and Kinnegad.

The PPP contract was awarded in March 2003 to the EuroLink Consortium (SIAC Construction Ltd and Cintra - Concesiones de Infraestructuras de Transporte S.A.) and allows for them to collect tolls for 30 years from that date.

This tolled section (from Kilcock to Kinnegad) opened on 12 December 2005, almost a year ahead of schedule. It is the second-most expensive toll road in Ireland (after the Dublin Port Tunnel). A toll of €3.50 (as of 2025) for cars is charged at a toll plaza just west of Kilcock and at smaller toll plazas at on and off-ramps at Enfield. Between Enfield and Kinnegad, no further access to the M4 is possible.

Eurolink operates this tolling scheme, the first in Ireland not operated by NTR plc. From 2005 to 2007, Eurolink started to accept several tags issued by other motorways such as M1, M8, eTrip and Dublin Port Tunnel tags. On 14 June 2007 NTR plc joined the Nationwide Electronic Toll Payment System introducing their popular EazyPass tags on the system and allowing all other toll plazas in the country (different from those owned by NTR plc) to accept them, meaning that each toll company&#x27;s electronic tag will work on all toll roads in the State.

In the 1 July 2006 edition of the &quot;Meath Chronicle&quot; it was claimed that up to 10% of the €420 million road project had &quot;to be ripped up and replaced&quot; shortly after it opened due to rushed construction, however this cost would have had to be carried by the toll operators, not the state, as per the contract.

The bypassed former N4 road has been reclassified as the R148.

===Motorway reclassification===
On 28 August 2009, the Department of Transport implemented the second round of proposed reclassifications of dual carriageways as motorways under the &quot;Roads Act 2007&quot;. A short section of the N4 between Kinnegad (J12) and McNead&#x27;s Bridge (J13) was affected by this. This extended the M4 westward by 6.8 km.

== Junctions == 

The route begins as a dual carriageway at junction 7 of the M50, becoming a motorway after junction 5. It then becomes a dual carriageway after junction 13. After Mullingar, it becomes a regular national road.

==Upgrades==
In July 2009, an upgrade of the section between the M50 junction and the Leixlip interchange was completed. In this section the road is three lanes in each direction, the median crossings were removed and the junction with the R120 is a fully grade-separated junction. Private accesses and some left turns remain which prevents the section from being designated a motorway. The speed limit is 80 km/h. There are currently no signal-controlled junctions on the N/M4 between the M50 motorway and the Sligo through-pass.

In 2013, a 5 km stretch of dual carriageway with at-grade crossover junctions between the M4 and the Mullingar bypass was upgraded to HQDC.

Construction of a 2+2 road at the 15 km stretch between Collooney and Castlebaldwin began in 2019 to improve road safety. The road was opened on 18 October 2021.

===Planned improvements to the route===

* Mullingar to Longford; 40 km dual carriageway, including bypass of Longford Town. As of November 2023, route corridor options have been presented, awaiting a decision on the preferred route corridor.
* Dromod to Carrick-on-Shannon 21 km, including 10 km bypass of Carrick-on-Shannon. At planning stage, as of November 2023.

<doc id="684860" wikidata="Q2656190" url="?curid=684860" title="1984–85 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships, with five points for the winner, four for the runner-up, three for losing semi-finalists, two for losing quarter-finalists, and one for losers in the last 16 round.

After the 1982 World Snooker Championship, two other tournaments – the International Open and the Professional Players Tournament – which were open to all members of the WPBSA carried points as per the previous system. Points for world championship finishes from 1983 became worth double the previous tariff, with ten points for the winner, eight for the runner up, and so on. In the 1983/84 snooker season, the Lada Classic was added as a ranking tournament. Merit points were awarded to players who were required to compete in qualifying rounds of ranking tournaments and reached the last 32, with a full merit point awarded if this was achieved in the world championship, and half a merit point otherwise. No points were awarded to a player who did not win any matches in a given tournament: for example, a top 16 player seeded into the last 32 of the world championship would not win any merit points if they lost their first match.

The tournaments that counted towards the 1984/1985 rankings were those which were open to all professional players, over three seasons. These were the Jameson International Open 1982 and 1983, the Professional Players Tournament 1982 and 1983, the 1984 Lada Classic, and the 1982, 1983 and 1984 Embassy World Championships. The list was published after the 1984 World Championship.

Steve Davis was ranked first with 32 points, ahead of Tony Knowles in second place with 21 points. Cliff Thorburn was third, with 20 points, a point ahead of Kirk Stevens in fourth. Ray Reardon dropped from second to fifth place. The top 16 players in the rankings were seeded into the main event of the 1985 World Snooker Championship, while all other players would need to enter the qualifying rounds. John Virgo, who did not win any ranking points in the 1983/1984 season, was the only player to lose their place in the top 16 from the previous year. Willie Thorne joined the top 16.

After the initial ranking list was published, the board of the WPBSA voted to award merit points, as well as ranking points, to players who had won qualifying groups and then progressed in the main tournament; the initial list had not included merit points for those players. Three pairs of players exchanged positions as a result: Tony Meo moved from eleventh to tenth place, ahead of Dennis Taylor; Dean Reynolds took 22nd place from Cliff Wilson who moved to 23rd; and Patsy Fagan overtook George Scott to be ranked 37th rather than 38th.

<text>Sweetheart Cup Company was a North American company that made paper cups, plastic cups and related products. In 2004, Sweetheart was acquired by the Solo Cup Company, which itself was acquired by Dart Container on May 4, 2012.

==History==

1911: Predecessor to Maryland Cup founded in Boston by Joseph Shapiro and his three brothers. The company sells ice cream, then expands to baked ice cream cones. The headquarters move to Baltimore.

1932–1936: Company diversifies, making matches and straws. Sweetheart, the name used on products, is inspired by picture of two children using straws to drink a milkshake from the same glass.

1947: Company executives vote, 14-to-1, against entering the cup business. But Joseph Shapiro votes yes - and the cup business is born.

1961: Maryland Cup goes public, consolidating 32 companies controlled by Shapiro family members.

1968: Joseph Shapiro dies.

1983: Maryland Cup bought by Fort Howard Paper Company, a Wisconsin-based paper manufacturer. At the time, Maryland Cup has 33 plants, more than 10,000 employees and a net worth of $250 million.

1983–1985: Fort Howard boosts capital spending in cup business, while cutting costs through layoffs.

1986: Customer service deteriorates and cup sales start to slide. Fort Howard acquires Lily-Tulip, cup-maker with net worth of $108 million.

1988: Fort Howard itself acquired in leveraged buyout by Morgan Stanley for $3.9 billion.

1989: Fort Howard spins off cup business as Sweetheart Holdings. Business has 15 U.S. factories and more than 8,000 employees.

1991: Sweetheart turns a profit on operations, but saddled by debt, net worth falls to −$95 million.

1992: Sweetheart introduces its Jazz disposable cups, which would become the company&#x27;s top-grossing stock design as of 2002.

2004: Sweetheart is purchased by Solo Cup Company.

<text>Austerfield is a village and civil parish in the City of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. It is to the north-east of the market town of Bawtry on the A614 road, and adjacent to the hamlet of Newington in Nottinghamshire, close to the River Idle. The population in 2001 was 571, which fell to 536 at the 2011 Census.

==Heritage==
The name Austerfield was first recorded in 715 and derives from the Old English &quot;Ouestraefelda (eowestre)&quot;, &quot;which means open land with a sheepfold&quot;. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Robert of Mortain, and having 27 villages, 40 freemen, a priest and a church.

The Council of Austerfield was convened here by King Aldfrith of Northumbria in AD 702 and attended by Berhtwald, Archbishop of Canterbury to decide on whether Saint Wilfrid should become Archbishop of York. Austerfield was then on the border between the two Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia.

Austerfield contains the 11th-century church of St Helena, which was built in 1080 by John de Builli, using stone from quarries at Roche Abbey. The church today has 19th-century several stained-glass windows designed by Charles Eamer Kempe. The nave has a sheela na gig, a rare type of quasi-erotic stone carving of a female figure sometimes found in Norman churches. This had been blocked into a wall in the 14th century and was rediscovered in 1898 during restoration work.

==Notable people==
In birth order:
*William Bradford (1590–1657), a Pilgrim Father and Governor of Plymouth Colony, was born in Austerfield and baptised in a font rediscovered at a local farm 40 years ago, which can now be seen in the church.
*Roy Clarke (born 1930), an English comedy writer known for the sitcoms &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; and &quot;Open All Hours&quot;, was born in Austerfield.

==Transport==
The nearest railway station to Austerfield is at Doncaster (9½ miles, 15 km). It is served by a bus route, as are Bawtry, Worksop and Sheffield. The A1M trunk road between London and the North passes to the west of the village.

<text>The Prague astronomical clock or Prague Orloj ( ) is a medieval astronomical clock attached to the Old Town Hall in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic.

== Description ==
The Orloj is mounted on the southern wall of Old Town Hall in the Old Town Square. The clock mechanism has three main components – the astronomical dial, representing the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky and displaying various astronomical details; statues of various Catholic saints stand on either side of the clock; &quot;The Walk of the Apostles&quot;, an hourly show of moving Apostle figures and other sculptures, notably a figure of a skeleton that represents Death, striking the time; and a calendar dial with medallions representing the months. According to local legend, the city will suffer if the clock is neglected and its good operation is placed in jeopardy; a ghost, mounted on the clock, was supposed to nod its head in confirmation. According to the legend, the only hope was represented by a boy born on New Year&#x27;s night.

== History ==

The oldest part of the Orloj, the mechanical clock and astronomical dial, dates back to 1410, when it was created by horologist Mikuláš of Kadaň and Charles University professor of mathematics and astronomy Jan Šindel. The first recorded mention of the clock was on 9 October 1410. Later, presumably around 1490, the calendar dial was added and the clock facade was decorated with gothic sculptures.

Formerly, it was believed that the Orloj was constructed in 1490 by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš); this is now known to be a historical mistake. A legend, recounted by Alois Jirásek, has it that the clockmaker Hanuš was blinded on the order of the Prague Councillors so that he could not repeat his work; in turn, he disabled the clock, and no one was able to repair it for the next hundred years.

In 1552 it was repaired by Jan Táborský (1500–1572), master clockmaker of Klokotská Hora, who also wrote a report of the clock where he mentioned Hanuš as the maker of this clock. This mistake, corrected by Zdeněk Horský, was due to an incorrect interpretation of records from the period. The mistaken assumption that Hanuš was the maker is probably connected with his reconstruction of the Old Town Hall in the years 1470–1473. The clock stopped working many times in the centuries after 1552, and was repaired many times. The legend was used as the main plot in the 2008 animated film &quot;Goat story – The Old Prague Legends&quot;.

In 1629 or 1659 wooden statues were added, and figures of the Apostles were added after a major repair in 1787–1791. During the next major repair in the years 1865–1866 the golden figure of a crowing rooster was added.
The Orloj suffered heavy damage on 7 and especially 8 May 1945, during the Prague uprising, when the Nazis fired on the south-west side of the Old Town Square from several armoured vehicles in an unsuccessful attempt to destroy one of the centers of the uprising. The hall and nearby buildings burned, along with the wooden sculptures on the clock and the calendar dial face made by Josef Mánes. After significant effort, the machinery was repaired, the wooden Apostles restored by Vojtěch Sucharda, and the Orloj started working again in 1948.

The Orloj was renovated in autumn 2005, when the statues and the lower calendar ring were restored. The wooden statues were covered with a net to keep pigeons away.

The last renovation of the astronomical clock was carried out from January to September 2018, following a reconstruction of the Old Town Tower. During the renovation, an electric clock mechanism that had been in operation since 1948 was replaced by an original mechanism from the 1860s.

=== 600th anniversary ===
On 9 October 2010, the Orloj&#x27;s 600th anniversary was celebrated with a light show on the face of the clock tower. Two projectors were used to project several animated videos on the clock. The videos showed it being built, torn down, rebuilt, and peeled away to show its internal mechanisms and the famous animated figures, as well as various events in the clock&#x27;s history. The video interacted with the tower&#x27;s architecture, such as rain rolling off the arch, and showing the passage of time with moving shadows.

=== 605th anniversary ===
On its 605th anniversary, 9 October 2015, the Orloj appeared on the Google home page as a Google Doodle.

=== 2018 reconstruction ===
The Orloj was taken down for reconstruction and replaced by a LED screen in early 2018, with the restoration works scheduled to last for the whole summer tourist season of 2018 and the restored actual Orloj eventually being back in service soon enough to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Czechoslovakia at the end of October 2018. With the reconstruction and restoration work completed, it resumed operations at 6 p.m. local time on 28 September 2018.

=== 2022 reconstruction controversy ===
The artwork on the Orloj became the center of controversy after a local heritage group noticed the reproduction had &quot;radically changed the appearance, ages, skin tone, dress and even genders of the figures&quot; illustrated by Mánes in 1866. A member of the Club for Old Prague, Milan Patka, registered a complaint with the Ministry of Culture, alleging that in the restoration, painter Stanislav Jirčík had deviated from the &quot;spirit and detail&quot; of the original. The National Heritage Inspectorate began investigations into the allegations.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the artist may have put the likenesses of his friends and acquaintances into the work, &quot;possibly as a joke.&quot; Upon this discovery, the Prague city council&#x27;s deputy mayor for transport and heritage criticized the botched restoration as &quot;banal and done by an amateur&quot; and suggested the city might need to commission a replacement. It is not yet known how the restoration&#x27;s discrepancy with the original had escaped detection when the work was installed in 2018.
== Astronomical dial ==
The astronomical dial is a form of mechanical astrolabe, a device used in medieval astronomy. Alternatively, one may consider the Orloj to be a primitive planetarium, displaying the current orientation of the universe relative to the Earth.

The astronomical dial has a background that represents the standing Earth and sky, and surrounding it operate four main moving components: the zodiacal ring, an outer rotating ring, an icon representing the Sun, and an icon representing the Moon.

=== Stationary background ===
The background represents the Earth and the local view of the sky. The blue circle directly in the centre represents the Earth, and the upper blue is the portion of the sky which is above the horizon. The red and black areas indicate portions of the sky below the horizon. During the daytime, the Sun sits over the blue part of the background and at night it sits over the black. During dawn or dusk, the mechanical sun is positioned over the red part of the background.

Written on the eastern (left) part of the horizon is &quot;aurora&quot; (dawn in Latin) and &quot;ortus&quot; (rising). On the western (right) part is &quot;occasus&quot; (sunset), and &quot;crepusculum&quot; (twilight).

Golden Roman numerals at the outer edge of blue circle are the timescale of a normal 24-hour day and indicate time in local Prague time, or Central European Time. Curved golden lines dividing the blue part of dial into 12 parts are marks for unequal &quot;hours&quot;. These hours are defined as 1/12 of the time between sunrise and sunset, and vary as the days grow longer or shorter during the year.

=== Zodiacal ring ===

Inside the large black outer circle lies another movable circle marked with the signs of the zodiac which indicates the location of the Sun on the ecliptic. The signs are shown in anticlockwise order. In the photograph accompanying this section, the Sun is currently moving anticlockwise from Cancer into Leo.

The displacement of the zodiac circle results from the use of a stereographic projection of the ecliptic plane using the North pole as the basis of the projection. This is commonly seen in astronomical clocks of the period.

The small golden star shows the position of the vernal equinox, and sidereal time can be read on the scale with golden Roman numerals. The zodiac is on the 365-tooth gear inside the machine. This gear is connected to the Sun gear and the Moon gear by a 24-tooth gear.

=== Old Czech time scale ===

At the outer edge of the clock, golden Schwabacher numerals are set on a black background. These numbers indicate Old Czech Time (or Italian hours), with 24 indicating the time of sunset, which varies during the year from as early as 16:00 in winter to 20:16 in summer. This ring moves back and forth during the year to coincide with the time of sunset. The outermost diameter of the ring is approximately 300cm (9.8ft).

=== Sun ===
The golden Sun moves around the zodiacal circle, thus showing its position on the ecliptic. The Sun is attached to an arm with a golden hand, and together they show the time in three different ways:

# The position of the golden hand over the Roman numerals on the background indicates the time in local Prague time.
# The position of the Sun over the curved golden lines indicates the time in unequal hours.
# The position of the golden hand over the outer ring indicates the hours passed after sunset in Old Czech Time.

Additionally, the distance of the Sun from the center of the dial shows the time of sunrise and sunset. The Sun and its hand are on the 366-tooth gear inside the machine.

=== Moon ===
The movement of the Moon on the ecliptic is shown similarly to that of the Sun, although the speed is much faster, due to the Moon&#x27;s orbit around the Earth. The Moon&#x27;s arm is on the 379-tooth gear inside the clock machine.

The half-silvered, half-black sphere of the Moon also shows the Lunar phase. The Moon has a 57-tooth gear inside its sphere, and is slowly rotated by a screw-thread attached to a weight, advancing two teeth per day. This movement, powered only by gravity, makes the Orloj unique in the world among astronomical clocks showing the phases of the Moon. The mechanism was created by an unknown maker, probably in the mid-17th century. Unlike the original device, the construction of which was described in a report from 1570, this mechanism produces much smaller deviation from the actual lunar phase of about one day in five years.

== Animated figures ==
The four figures flanking the clock are set in motion on the hour, and represent four things that were despised at the time of the clock&#x27;s making. From left to right in the photographs, the first is vanity, represented by a figure admiring himself in a mirror. Next, the miser holding a bag of gold represents greed or usury. Across the clock stands Death, a skeleton that strikes the time upon the hour. Finally, there is a Turkish figure representing lust and earthly pleasures. On the hour, the skeleton rings the bell and immediately all other figures shake their heads side to side, signifying their unreadiness &quot;to go&quot;.

Every hour of the day, statues of the Twelve Apostles with their attributes appear at the doorways above the clock. The left and right windows above the astronomical clock slide aside to reveal the Apostles as viewed from the square in this order: James the Less and Peter, Andrew and Matthias, Thaddeus and Philip, Thomas and Paul, John and Simon, Barnabas and Bartholomew. Unlike the list of the Twelve Apostles mentioned in the canonical gospels, James the Great and Matthew are missing, replaced by Paul and Barnabas.

== Calendar ==
The calendar plate below the clock was replaced by a copy in 1880. The original made by Josef Mánes is stored in the Prague City Museum. On the edge of the circle is a church calendar with fixed holidays and the names of 365 saints. The board displays allegories of the months. Smaller images represent zodiac signs.

Next to the calendar stands a philosopher, archangel Michael pointing at the top of the dial, an astronomer and a chronicler.

<doc id="684885" wikidata="Q1194571" url="?curid=684885" title="The Inspector">
<text>The Inspector is an American series of 34 theatrical cartoon shorts produced between 1965 and 1969 by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and released through United Artists. The cartoons are dedicated to an animated version of Inspector Clouseau comically battling against a rogues&#x27; gallery of internationally styled villains.

Outside of the episode titles, much of the humor in these shorts is derived in part from the surreality of the villains and situations, and also from the stylized animated slapstick, the brunt of which is endured by the Inspector, who is often bested by his nemeses, forcing him to face the wrath of his supervisor, the blustery and ill-tempered Commissioner (based on Herbert Lom&#x27;s portrayal of Commissioner Dreyfus, if somewhat more violent) who holds him in well-deserved contempt.

== Characters ==

=== The Inspector ===
The Inspector is a senior detective for the Sûreté and assisted in most earlier episodes by Sergeant Deux-Deux, who is voiced by Pat Harrington Jr.; In The Pink Panther Show bumpers, he is instead voiced by Marvin Miller. Though his actual name is never mentioned, the character is clearly based on Inspector Jacques Clouseau from &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; films (to the point its design was later reused in the opening credits of the 1968 &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; film, establishing that both inspectors are, in fact, one and the same). But in slight contrast to the completely inept live-action Clouseau, the animated Inspector is more competent, though still prone to bad luck and poor judgment.

=== Sergeant Deux-Deux ===
The Inspector&#x27;s young and timid assistant, Sergeant Deux-Deux (pronounced &quot;Doo-Doo&quot;), is a slow-talking Spaniard and gendarme. Like the Inspector, he is voiced by Pat Harrington Jr., and in bumpers for The Pink Panther Show, he is voiced by Marvin Miller; in &quot;La Feet&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, he is instead voiced by Don Messick, and the character is given a younger appearance and more naive personality. He frequently utters the exclamation &quot;Jole Frijoles&quot; (&quot;Holy Beans&quot;) in exciting or extreme situations, and often replies to the Inspector in his native tongue, saying &quot;Sí&quot;, only to be admonished by the Inspector who often tells him, &quot;Don&#x27;t say &#x27;sí&#x27;, say &#x27;oui&#x27;&quot;, which sometimes leads to confusing situations between the two. Deux Deux usually responded afterwards by intoning: &quot;Sí, I mean oui, Inspector.&quot; In one cartoon, Deux Deux said &quot;ouisick&quot; instead of &quot;seasick&quot;. On a couple of occasions, when the Inspector is incapacitated, Deux-Deux himself almost effortlessly manages to apprehend the culprit. He thinks of the Inspector as his hero.

=== The Commissioner ===
The Commissioner, as his name implies, is the commissioner of the French police force and the boss of the Inspector and Sgt. Deux-Deux. The Commissioner is a heavily built, blustery, ill-tempered, bullying, bald man dressed in a suit and a black tie. He was voiced by Larry Storch in his first two appearances, then by Paul Frees from 1966 to 1967 (sans 1967&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Can-Can&quot;, where he is voiced by Mark Skor), and by Marvin Miller in all remaining appearances. He is usually angry in his interactions with the Inspector, for instance because of the Inspector&#x27;s failure to complete his missions or because the Inspector has inadvertently caused him physical harm. The short &quot;That&#x27;s No Lady - That&#x27;s Notre Dame&quot; introduces his wife (voiced by Diana Maddox) who refers to him as &#x27;Henri&#x27;. Despite the Inspector&#x27;s general incompetence (which the Commissioner acknowledges) the Commissioner never actually fires him, or at least not permanently.

== Production ==
Pat Harrington Jr. provided voices for both the Inspector and Deux-Deux; (in &quot;La Feet&#x27;s Defeat&quot;, Deux-Deux is voiced by Don Messick and sports a younger, more naive appearance.) The Commissioner was voiced by Larry Storch for his first two appearances, before Paul Frees took on the role up until &quot;Bomb Voyage&quot;, and voiced the character one last time in &quot;Le Escape Goat&quot;. In &quot;Canadian Can-Can&quot;, the Commissioner is voiced by Mark Skor, who also voiced the evil face of Two-Faced Harry, the short&#x27;s antagonist. The Commissioner was then voiced by Marvin Miller for his remaining appearances. Miller also assumed the role of both the Inspector and Sgt. Deux-Deux in the wraparound bumpers produced for the inaugural season of &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;.

The first entry in the series, &quot;The Great De Gaulle Stone Operation,&quot; preceded screenings of the 1965 James Bond film &quot;Thunderball&quot;.

The Inspector character design remained basically the same throughout the DePatie–Freleng shorts, and was used in the opening credit sequence of the 1968 live-action film &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; (with Alan Arkin as Clouseau), but in the opening titles of later &quot;Pink Panther&quot; features beginning in the 1970s, his look is changed dramatically to resemble Sellers, and then Steve Martin in the 2006 reboot of the series.

The theme music heard during the titles of the cartoon was the instrumental &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; by Henry Mancini, from the 1964 feature film of the same name (the second entry in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; live-action film series). Additional music in the cartoons was composed initially by William Lava, then Walter Greene. Two shorts had their own unique arrangement of the theme music during the opening sequence, &quot;Napoleon Blown-Aparte&quot; and &quot;Cock-A-Doodle Deux Deux&quot;.

17 entries made their television debut during the inaugural season (1969–1970) of &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;, featuring shorter opening titles (minus credits). The remaining 17 entries appeared during the show&#x27;s second season with complete theatrical opening titles.

== Home video ==
A DVD containing the first 17 shorts was released on March 4, 2008, from MGM Home Entertainment/20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

A DVD set titled &quot;Pink Panther and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection&quot; released on January 27, 2009, by MGM contains the previously released set of the first 17 shorts and a second set of the last 17 shorts.

The first season of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; is available for viewing on Amazon Video in the United States.

On April 26, 2016, Kino Lorber released &quot;The Inspector: The DePatie-Freleng Collection&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray - this 2-disc DVD and Blu-ray release set collects the 34 (17 for each disc) classic shorts, along with retrospective featurettes focusing on DePatie-Freleng Enterprises.

== Revival ==
&quot;The Inspector&quot; was revived in 1993 for the syndicated series, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, voiced by Brian George. The Inspector often works alongside the Pink Panther when he is depicted in law enforcement.

== In other media ==
A back-up feature starring the Inspector appeared regularly in &quot;The Pink Panther and the Inspector&quot; comic books published by Gold Key comics, and he also starred in his own title. He also appears in the computer game The Pink Panther: Passport to Peril, where he hires the Pink Panther to help him fight crime. The Inspector and Deux-Deux also appear in the 1981 story record &quot;A Pink Panther Christmas&quot; from Kid Stuff Records, in which they try to capture The Pink Panther while he is helping Santa Claus.

<text>Finningley is a village and civil parish in the City of Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England. Historically in Nottinghamshire, it lies on the A614 road between Bawtry and Thorne, about 6 miles south-east of Doncaster. In the 2011 census, it had a population of 1,497. The Finningley ward of Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council covers 16.8 square miles, including the villages of Auckley, Branton, Blaxton, Hayfield and Bessacarr Grange, and part of Cantley.

==History==
The parish church of Holy Trinity is Norman, with a 13th-century chancel.

The place name Finningley contains the Old English word, &quot;fenn&quot;, a fen, a marsh, marshland + &quot;-ingas&quot; (Old English), the people of...; the people called after... + &quot;lēah&quot; (Old English), a glade, clearing; (later) a pasture, meadow... so a &quot;Clearing of the fen-dwellers&quot;.

==Airport==
Finningley is known for its airport, once RAF Finningley. The station housed a &#x27;V&#x27; force of Vulcan bombers in the Cold War, and for 35 years hosted a regular air show, which by the 1990s was the country&#x27;s largest one-day event of its kind. However, the end of the Cold War led to the airfield closing in April 1996 and the air show coming to an end.

The long runway, currently the second longest in Northern England, was large enough to take even Concorde, and in the period after the closure of the RAF airfield there were several campaigns to turn Finningley into a commercial airport for the unserved South Yorkshire region, along with neighbouring Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire).

Plans for the conversion were approved in 2003 and the first flights served in April 2005. The airport was named Robin Hood Airport Doncaster Sheffield, then renamed Doncaster Sheffield Airport. In November 2022 it closed to passenger traffic. Planning permission had been given for a railway station – the former Finningley railway station, which closed in 1961 – but it is now unlikely to be built.

==Notable businesses==
Leon Motors, a company located in Finningley, operated bus services in Doncaster. Formed in 1922, it was taken over by MASS of North Anston in 2004 but has since ceased operating from the Old Bawtry Road site in Finningley.

Finningley is home to a Motocross venue.

==Notable people==
*Elsie Howey (1884–1963), a leading suffragette, was born here.

<text>The  (, ; ), also rendered as epee in English, is the largest and heaviest of the three weapons used in the sport of fencing. The modern derives from the 19th-century , a weapon which itself derives from the French small sword.

As a thrusting weapon, the is similar to a foil (contrasted with a sabre, which is designed for slashing). It has a stiffer blade than a foil. It is triangular in cross-section with a V-shaped groove called a fuller. The also has a larger bell guard designed to protect the user’s arm. In addition to the larger &quot;bell&quot; guard and blade, the weighs more than the foil and sabre which contributes to its reputation of being the slowest form of fencing. The techniques of use differ, as there are no rules regarding priority and a lack of right of way. Thus, immediate counterattacks are a common feature of fencing. The entire body is a valid target area.

==Overview==
While the modern sport of fencing has three weapons — foil, , and sabre, each a separate event — the is the only one in which the entire body is the valid target area (the others are restricted to varying areas above the waist). The is the heaviest of the three modern fencing weapons. As with all fencing disciplines, require concentration, accuracy, and speed. Since the entire body is a target, a successful fencer must be able to anticipate the opponent&#x27;s moves and strike the opponent at the correct time.

In the highest-level competitions, an electrically grounded (earthed) piste is used to prevent floor hits from registering as touches. In fencing, unlike in the other two disciplines, there are no right-of-way rules regarding attacks, other than the aforementioned rule regarding touches with only the point of the weapon. Touches are awarded solely on the basis of which fencer makes a touch first, according to the electronic scoring machines. Also, double-touches are allowed in , although the touches must occur within 40 milliseconds ( of a second) of each other.

A special aspect of the discipline is the counterattack, a tactic employed in response to an attack. Some specifications include two varieties, the stop-thrust and the time thrust, which are (respectively) a simple counterattack and a counterattack on the opposition. With the absence of right-of-way, following an attack and landing a counterattack correctly can be a highly efficient way to score a touch, hence the counterattack&#x27;s ubiquity in fencing.

==Description==
A modern , of size 5, for use by adult fencers has a blade that measures from the guard to the tip. The total weight of the weapon ready for use is less than , with most competition weapons being much lighter, weighing . for use by smaller children
are shorter and lighter (e.g. size 0), making it easier for them to use.

The blade of an is triangular in section, whereas that of a foil is rectangular, and neither blade has a cutting edge. Wires may run down a groove in blades fitted for electric scoring, with a depressible button capping the point. In competitive fencing, the width of any of the three sides of an &#x27;s blade is limited to .

The guard has numerous forms, but all are essentially a hemispherical shield, the section of which fits in a cylinder. This is frequently called a bell guard. As the hand is a valid target in competitive fencing, the guard is much larger and more protective than that of a foil, having a depth of and a diameter more likely to be toward the maximum of .

As with a foil, the grip of an can be exchanged for another if it has a screw-on pommel. Grip options primarily include the French grip and the pistol grip.

In competitions, a valid touch is scored if a fencer&#x27;s weapon touches the opponent with enough force to depress the tip; by rule, this is a minimum of . The tip is wired to a connector in the guard, then to an electronic scoring device or &quot;box&quot;. The guard, blade, and handle of the are all grounded to the scoring box to prevent hits to the weapon from registering as touches.
In the groove formed by the V-shaped blade, there are two thin wires leading from the far end of the blade to a connector in the guard. These wires are held in place with a strong glue. The amount of glue is kept to a minimum as in the unlikely (but possible) case that a fencer manages a touch in that glue, the touch would be registered on the electrical equipment, as the glue is not conductive (the blade is grounded). In the event of tip to tip hits, a point should not be awarded. A &quot;body cord&quot; with a three-pronged plug at each end is placed underneath the fencer&#x27;s clothing and attached to the connector in the guard, then to a wire leading to the scoring box. The scoring box signals with lights (one for each fencer) and a tone each time the tip is depressed.

The tip of an electric , called the &quot;button&quot;, comprises several parts: the mushroom-shaped, movable (&#x27;point of arrest&#x27;) at the end; its housing or &quot;barrel&quot; which is threaded onto the blade; a contact spring; and a return spring. The tips are generally held in place by two small grub screws, which thread into the sides of the tip through elongated openings on either side of the barrel. The screws hold the tip within the barrel but are allowed to travel freely in the openings. While this is the most common system, screwless variations do exist. The return spring must allow the tip to support a force of without registering a touch. Finally, an épée tip must allow a shim of to be inserted between the and the barrel, and when a shim is inserted and the tip depressed, it should not register a touch. The contact spring is threaded in or out of the tip to adjust for this distance. These specifications are tested at the start of each bout during competitions. During competitions, fencers are required to have a minimum of two weapons and two body wires in case of failure or breakage.

Bouts with the different fencing weapons have a different tempo; as with foil fencing, the tempo for an bout is rather slow with sudden bursts of speed, but these are more common in due to counterattacks.

==Dueling==
The French word ultimately derives from Latin . The term was introduced into English in the 1880s for the sportive fencing weapon.

Like the foil (), the evolved from light civilian weapons such as the small sword, which, since the late 17th century, had been the most commonly used dueling sword, replacing the rapier.

The dueling sword developed in the 19th century when, under pressure from the authorities, duels were more frequently fought until &quot;first blood&quot; only, instead of to the death. Under this provision, it became sufficient to inflict a minor nick on the wrist or other exposed area on the opponent in order to win the duel. This resulted in emphasis on light touches to the arm and hand, while downplaying hits to the torso (chest, back, groin). Rapiers with full-cup guards had been made since the mid 17th century, but were not widespread before the 19th century.

==Sport==
Today, fencing somewhat resembles 19th-century dueling. An fencer must hit the target with the tip of the weapon. A difference between versus both foil and sabre is that (body-to-body) contact between fencers is not necessarily an offense in , unless it is done with &quot;brutality or violence&quot;.

In the pre-electric era, fencers used a different kind of , a three-pronged point with small protruding spikes, which would snag on the opponent&#x27;s clothing or mask, helping the referee to see the hits. The spikes caused fencing to be a notoriously painful affair, and fencers could be easily recognized by the tears in their jacket sleeves. A later evolution of the sport used a point that was dipped in a dye, which showed the location of touches on a white uniform; the dye was soluble in weak acid (e.g., acetic acid) to remove old marks. Today, competition is done with electric weapons, where a circuit is closed when the touch is made. Non-electric weapons are now typically used only for practice, generally fitted with plastic buttons or solid &quot;dummy points&quot;.

In 2007, MIT fencing coach Eric Sollee and his student Johan Harmenberg authored a book that explored a line of tactical thought that diverged from fencing styles established in the 1970s and 1980s. Harmenberg won the World Fencing Championships and the Olympic gold medal using this strategic approach, built on what he called the &quot;Sollee conjectures&quot; or the &quot;three conjectures&quot;:

# Is it possible for the fencer with the lower technical ability to decide the technical level at which a bout will be fought?
# Can the fencer with the shorter fencing distance control the distance in a bout?
# Is it possible to force one&#x27;s opponent into your own area of greatest strength?

They credited the system for helping Harmenberg close the fencing distance, use absence of blade with destructive parries to prevent opponents from their own strongest moves, and pushing them into attacking higha prerequisite for Harmenberg using his own strongest move. Harmenberg used this approach to win eight individual and team gold medals at Olympics, World Fencing Championships, and Fencing World Cup competitions.

<text>Tijuana Toads is a series of 17 theatrical cartoons produced by DePatie–Freleng and released through United Artists.

== Plot ==
The series concerns two toads, El Toro and Pancho, who live in the Mexican city of Tijuana. Throughout the cartoon they try to eat their prey, but always get outsmarted. They would sometimes themselves be targeted by a bird, Crazylegs Crane, and would in turn always outsmart him.

The series introduced two characters who later got their own series. &quot;The Blue Racer&quot; first appeared in &quot;&quot;Snake in the Gracias&quot; (1971) before getting his own series in 1972. &quot;Crazylegs Crane&quot; first appeared in &quot;Go for Croack&quot;&quot; (1969), and also spun off to his own series for television in 1978 on ABC. Both characters were voiced by Larry D. Mann, except in &quot;Flight to the Finish&quot; where Bob Holt voiced Crazylegs Crane.

El Toro was voiced by actor Don Diamond and Pancho voiced by Tom Holland. Crazylegs Crane was voiced by Larry D. Mann. Directorial duties were split between Hawley Pratt, Art Davis, Grant Simmons, and Gerry Chiniquy.

When the series began airing in 1976 as part of &quot;The Pink Panther Laugh and a Half Hour and a Half Show&quot;, it was re-dubbed and renamed &quot;Texas Toads&quot; to make the series less offensive. A laugh track was added to the new soundtrack, and the toads were given the new names of Fatso and Banjo. Producer David H. DePatie later commented on the process:
== Filmography ==
== Note ==
&quot;Tijuana Toads&quot; shorts aired on Cartoon Network and Boomerang.

== Remade and reused scenes and plots ==
* &quot;Tijuana Toads&quot; (first Episode, a.k.a. &quot;Tall in the Grass&quot;) reused scenes based from &quot;Tree for Two&quot;, &quot;Dr. Jerkyll&#x27;s Hyde&quot;, and &quot;Two Crows from Tacos&quot;.
* &quot;A Pair of Greenbacks&quot; reused some scenes based on &quot;Mouse and Garden&quot; and &quot;Two Crows from Tacos&quot;.
* &quot;Go for Croak&quot; reused the drinking of nitroglycerin trick from &quot;Mouse Mazurka&quot;.
* &quot;Never on Thirsty&quot; reused scenes from &quot;The Honey-mousers&quot;.

== Revivals ==
The characters were resurrected for the 1993 TV series &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. As the case when the original shorts were shown on TV, they were rebranded as the Texas Toads. The toads were redesigned as western sheriffs with oversized cowboy hats replacing their sombreros.

== Home video ==
=== VHS ===
In 1987, &quot;Go for Croak&quot; was released on VHS as part of &quot;Cartoon Festival&quot;.

=== DVD and Blu-ray ===
In 2016, Kino Lorber released the complete series with the original soundtrack, digitally remastered from the original negatives and in the original ratio.

== Popular culture ==
A restaurant dubbed under the name &quot;Pancho i Toro - Pizza &amp; Grill Sesvete&quot; is located in Sesvete, Croatia.

<doc id="684911" wikidata="Q375510" url="?curid=684911" title="Richard Wright (footballer)">
<text>Richard Ian Wright (born 5 November 1977) is an English football coach and former professional footballer who is a goalkeeping coach for Premier League club Manchester City.

As a player he was a goalkeeper. He joined Ipswich Town as a trainee, going on to play for the club 298 times between 1995 and 2001. He then moved to Premier League club Arsenal, before being signed by Everton in 2002, where he spent five years. A brief spell on loan from West Ham United with Southampton was followed by a transfer back to Ipswich Town. After a short spell at Sheffield United, a third stint at Ipswich and a brief time at Preston North End, he joined Premier League champions Manchester City on a free transfer in 2012. After four years at City, during which he did not play at all, he announced his retirement in May 2016. He remained with City as a coach under new manager Pep Guardiola.

He was a member of the England squad, earning two caps, and was included in Kevin Keegan&#x27;s 23 man squad for UEFA Euro 2000 but did not see the field.

==Club career==
===Ipswich Town===
Wright was born in Ipswich, Suffolk and signed a professional contract with Ipswich Town on 2 January 1995 after serving his apprenticeship and made his debut as a 17-year-old in a 2–0 victory at home to Coventry City in May that year. The season ended with Ipswich&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, and for the following four, Ipswich lost in the promotion play-offs from the Football League First Division.

He played a major role in Ipswich&#x27;s 1999–2000 season when the club were promoted via the play-offs at the fifth attempt. On 29 May 2000, in the play-off final against Barnsley, Ipswich won 4–2, with Wright&#x27;s long goal kick being flicked on by Marcus Stewart for Richard Naylor to put them 2–1 up. Wright scored an unfortunate own goal when a shot rebounded off the bar and hit him, and then gave away a penalty kick by fouling Craig Hignett, but saved it from Darren Barnard. In Ipswich&#x27;s first season back in the top flight, he inspired them to 5th place and qualification to the UEFA Cup.

===Arsenal===
Wright joined Arsenal on 5 July 2001 for £2 million. He signed a five-year contract. Manager Arsène Wenger envisaged him as a long-term successor to David Seaman and also as a more experienced competitor for the previous second-choice goalkeeper Alex Manninger, who soon left the club.

Wright made his debut against Derby County on 29 September, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 win at Pride Park which put his team on the summit of the table. On his UEFA Champions League debut against Panathinaikos he saved an Angelos Basinas penalty to help his side win 2–1. Despite an injury to Seaman which gave him an extended run in the team, he did not capitalise on the opportunity, punching the ball into his own net in a 4–2 home defeat to Charlton Athletic on 4 November when trying to clear from Paul Konchesky, and then two weeks later he was at fault for Gus Poyet&#x27;s injury time equaliser in the North London Derby against Tottenham Hotspur. Four days later, he was substituted at half time with injury in a UEFA Champions League match away to Deportivo de La Coruña, being replaced by youth goalkeeper Stuart Taylor in the 2–0 defeat. He slipped to third choice behind Taylor and played mostly FA Cup matches for the remainder of the season, up to and including the semi-final against Middlesbrough, although Seaman replaced him for the final, which Arsenal won 2–0 against Chelsea. He made his last Arsenal appearance on the final day of the 2001–02 season, a 4–3 victory over Everton. Arsene Wenger deliberately started him for the match, so that he ended the season with 10 league appearances, qualifying him for a winners&#x27; medal; he was substituted for Stuart Taylor late in the game, so that Taylor also had 10 appearances and earned a medal. Wright made 22 appearances for Arsenal in total.

===Everton===
After Seaman was given a one-year contract extension, Wright sought first-team action elsewhere, and on 24 July 2002 he moved to Everton for an initial £3.5 million, potentially rising by another million if a set number of appearances were reached.

On his Goodison Park debut on 17 August, he made an error and gifted a goal to Les Ferdinand in a 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur, but a week later he saved a penalty from Kevin Phillips in a 1–0 win at Sunderland. After the season had ended, on 13 June 2003 (Friday the 13th), he had a freak accident when he fell from his loft, injuring his shoulder.

In August 2003, Everton brought in veteran Nigel Martyn. On 13 September, Wright went off injured 26 minutes into an eventual 2–2 draw against Newcastle United. He faced knee surgery and missed the remainder of the season.

During the 2005–06 season, Martyn had a spell out with injury, but Wright injured himself soon after while warming up for a match against Chelsea on 8 February 2006; a large sign instructed players to use temporary goals for their warm-up but he ignored the warning and fell on the sign, injuring his ankle. Despite Martyn&#x27;s retirement, Wright remained second in the pecking order for the 2006–07 season behind new arrival Tim Howard. He played 71 games in total for Everton, but only two in his last campaign.

===West Ham United===
Wright was released by Everton at the end of the 2006–07 season, and signed for West Ham United on 4 July 2007. Second-choice to Robert Green, he made his Hammers debut on 28 August in a 2–1 win at Bristol Rovers in the second round of the League Cup.

On 20 March 2008, having only played two further League Cup games for West Ham he joined Southampton of the Championship on a month&#x27;s loan as their first three goalkeepers were all unavailable through injury. Two days later, he made his debut in a goalless home draw with Coventry City. On 18 April, the loan was extended to the end of the 2007–08 season, he totalled seven appearances for the Saints.

===Return to Ipswich Town===
Wright rejoined Ipswich on 21 July 2008 for an undisclosed fee on a two-year contract with the option of a third year. He then made his 300th club appearance for Ipswich in a 4–1 loss against Wigan Athletic on 23 September in the third round of the League Cup. His fine performances for his hometown club earned him the Players and supporters&#x27; player of the season awards for the 2008–2009 season. On 1 December 2009 Wright was ruled out for up to four months following a knee injury suffered during a 2–1 win against Cardiff City.
Wright was released by Ipswich at the end of the 2009–10 season.

===Sheffield United===
After a brief trial spell, Wright joined Sheffield United on a free transfer on a four-month short-term deal in September 2010, having been extended until the end of the season. Despite this Wright spent most of his time at Bramall Lane injured and made only two starts, both times being withdrawn midway through the game due to further injuries. His contract was terminated with Sheffield United by mutual consent at the start of April 2011.

===Third spell at Ipswich Town===
Wright returned to Ipswich in the summer of 2011 to train with the club. Having been on trial at other clubs he had impressed enough while training with Ipswich to earn a call up to the reserves, in which he featured in a game against Colchester United.

Wright re-signed for the club for his third spell on 23 November 2011. Earlier in the week he had stated he wanted to return to the club: &quot;I love Ipswich Town Football Club, I don&#x27;t hide that. I think everyone knows that, but at the moment there&#x27;s nothing there for me – simple as that, you just get on with it and look elsewhere. If anything changed and something came up (at Ipswich) then I&#x27;d be a liar to say I wouldn&#x27;t consider it because I would.&quot; In his third debut for the club, Wright conceded three times in a 3–2 home defeat to Reading.

===Preston North End===
On 1 July 2012, Wright signed for Preston North End; however, he left the club only one week into pre-season training as he was suffering from homesickness, having made no appearances for the club.

===Manchester City===
Following a trial with Colchester United, Wright signed for Manchester City on 30 August 2012, completing a free transfer and agreeing a one-year contract. On 10 July 2013, Wright signed a one-year extension with City. Despite not making a competitive appearance for the club in either season, he was awarded a new contract for the 2014–15 season, at the expense of second-choice Costel Pantilimon. The contract was extended by one year for the fourth consecutive season, during summer 2015. Wright remained on the books of Manchester City for four years in total, but never made a first-team appearance before announcing his retirement on 17 May 2016. He remained as a coach under new manager Pep Guardiola.

==International career==
Wright was capped twice for England, making his debut against Malta in a friendly on 3 June 2000; he gave away two penalty kicks, conceding the first as David Carabott&#x27;s shot rebounded into the net off his head after hitting the post, and saving the second, again from Carabott, in the 88th minute as England won 2–1. He was a member of the England UEFA Euro 2000 squad, where he was third choice behind David Seaman and Nigel Martyn.

On 15 August 2001, he earned his second and final cap, replacing the injured David James, who himself had replaced Martyn at half-time in a 2–0 friendly defeat against the Netherlands at White Hart Lane. Wright kept a clean sheet, as England were already 2–0 down when he came on.

==Coaching career==
Following his retirement at the end of the 2015–16 season, Wright remained with Manchester City and became a goalkeeping coach on Pep Guardiola&#x27;s coaching staff.

==Personal life==
In November 1998, Wright and his girlfriend Kelly Hammond had a son, Harry. In May 2000, two days after Ipswich had beaten Bolton Wanderers in the play-off semi-final to reach Wembley, he and Kelly married. Wright&#x27;s father-in-law, Geoff Hammond, a former full-back, scored two goals in 69 Ipswich appearances between 1970 and 1973. Harry, who also plays as a goalkeeper, signed a professional deal for Ipswich on his 17th birthday.

<text>George Brock Chisholm (18 May 1896 – 4 February 1971) was a Canadian psychiatrist, medical practitioner, World War I veteran, and the first director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO). He was the 13th Canadian Surgeon General and the recipient of numerous accolades, including Order of Canada, Order of the British Empire, Military Cross, and the military Efficiency Decoration.

==Background==
Brock Chisholm was born on 18 May 1896, in Oakville, Ontario, to a family with deep ties to the region. Under Sir Isaac Brock, his great-grandfather fought against the Americans during the War of 1812. His great grandfather’s brother, William, was Oakville’s founder. His father was Frank Chisholm, who ran a coal yard. He had a Presbyterian upbringing.

==Career==
===Canada===
In 1915 during the First World War, age 18, Chisholm joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force, serving in the 15th Battalion, CEF as a cook, sniper, machine gunner and scout. His leadership and heroism were twice rewarded (after being twice wounded): with a Military Cross for his efforts in a battle outside of Lens, France; and the Bar. He rose to the rank of captain, was injured once, and returned home in 1917. The full citation for his Military Cross appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in March 1918 and reads as follows:

His bar&#x27;s citation:

After the war, Chisholm pursued his lifelong passion of medicine, earning his MD from the University of Toronto by 1924 before interning in England, where he specialized in psychiatry. After six years in private practice in his native Oakville, he attended Yale University where he specialized in the mental health of children. During this time, Chisholm developed his strong view that children should be raised in an &quot;as intellectually free environment&quot; as possible, independent of the prejudices and biases (political, moral and religious) of their parents.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Chisholm rapidly rose in stature within the Canadian military and government. He joined the war effort as a psychiatrist dealing with psychological aspects of soldier training, before rising to the rank of Director General Medical Services, the highest position within the medical ranks of the Canadian Army. He was the first psychiatrist to head the medical ranks of any army in the world.

In 1944, the Canadian Government created the position of Deputy Minister of Health. Chisholm was the first person to occupy the post and held it until 1946.

===WHO===

In 1946, Chisholm became executive secretary of the Interim Commission of the World Health Organization (WHO), based in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO succeeded the League of Nations&#x27;s Health Organization. Chishom was one of 16 international experts consulted in drafting the agency&#x27;s first constitution. He recommended the WHO&#x27;s name, with emphasis on &quot;world.&quot; He defined health for the WHO as &quot;a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&quot; The WHO charter also established that health is a fundamental human right and that &quot;the health of all peoples is fundamental to the attainment of peace and security.&quot;

The WHO became a permanent UN fixture in April 1948, and Chisholm became the agency&#x27;s first Director General on a 46–2 vote. Chisholm was now in the unique position of being able to bring his views on the importance of international mental and physical health to the world. Refusing re-election, he occupied the post until 1953, during which time the WHO dealt successfully with a cholera epidemic in Egypt, malaria outbreaks in Greece and Sardinia, and introduced shortwave epidemic-warning services for ships at sea.

===Later career===

Chisholm served as president of the World Federation of Mental Health (1957–58).

He was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt the Constitution for the Federation of Earth.

==Beliefs==

Chisholm was a controversial public speaker who nevertheless spoke with great conviction, and drew much criticism from the Canadian public for comments in the mid-1940s that children should not be encouraged to believe in Santa Claus, the Bible or anything he regarded as supernaturalism. Calls for his resignation as Deputy Minister of Health were quelled by his appointment as Executive Secretary of the WHO, but his public perception as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most famously articulate angry man&quot; lingered.

In February 1946, Chisholm spoke from the pulpit to the First Unitarian Congregation of Ottawa. At that time he was not a Unitarian, but he later became a member of the First Unitarian Church of Victoria and served as Moderator of the American Unitarian Association.

Five decades after his death, Chisholm&#x27;s beliefs were still exciting controversy. In June 2024, a blogger analysed Chisholm&#x27;s writings and career, coming to the conclusion that, although Chisholm may have been neither a declared Marxist nor a Communist, he had nonetheless &quot;... been working diligently for a worldwide socialistic system... and we know socialism is just one of many forms of collectivism located in the same parking lot as Marxism.&quot; In April 2024, an internet fact-checker came to the conclusion that, although Chisholm wasn&#x27;t the source of a widely-circulated quotation, this provocative sentence was nonetheless a valid summary of an article Chisholm had published in 1946 &quot;barring the reference to &#x27;individualism&#x27;&quot;. In their Facebook post, this fact-checker was highly critical of Chisholm&#x27;s strongly-felt view &quot;that &#x27;morality&#x27; and the &#x27;poisonous certainties&#x27; fed to us by our &#x27;parents, Sunday school teachers, priests&#x27; and others should be thrown away in favor of SELF-directed &#x27;intellectual freedom&#x27;.&quot;

==Marriage==

On 21 June 1924, Chisholm married Grace McLean Ryrie. They had two children, Catherine Anne and Brock Ryrie.

==Death==

On 4 February 1971, Chisholm died age 74 in Veterans&#x27; Hospital, Victoria, British Columbia, after a series of strokes.

==Honors, awards==

Chisholm&#x27;s honors and awards include:

* 1945: Medal of the Pasteur Institute
* 1953: Lasker Award
* 1957: Honorary President of the World Federalist Movement-Canada
* 1959: Humanist of the Year (American Humanist Association)
* 1967: Companion of the Order of Canada

He was an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine, of the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Public Health Association among others.

==Legacy==

One reviewer of John Farley&#x27;s biography lauded Chisholm&#x27;s visionary ideas and asserted that &quot;his worthy legacy does honor to Canada&quot;. Another reviewer asserted that &quot;There were no tears, in Canada or anywhere else, when Chisholm announced his retirement at age 57 in 1953... Chisholm’s vision for the WHO was impractical and a failure. The organization evolved almost literally in spite of its director general.&quot;

At his death, the &quot;New York Times&quot; remembered Chisholm as a &quot;small-town doctor who became director general of the World Health Organization&quot; and also called him &quot;Prophet of Disaster.&quot;

Historica Canada notes he was an early leader in warning about the &quot;danger of pollution, overpopulation, and the nuclear arms race.&quot;

<text>The TI 73 series is a series of graphing calculators made by Texas Instruments, all of which have identical hardware.

The original TI-73 graphing calculator was originally designed in 1998 as a replacement for the TI-80 for use at a middle school level (grades 6-8). Its primary advantage over the TI-80 is its 512 KB of flash memory, which holds the calculator&#x27;s operating system and thereby allows the calculator to be upgraded. Other advantages over the TI-80 are the TI-73&#x27;s standard sized screen (as opposed to the TI-80&#x27;s smaller screen), the addition of a link port, 25 KB of RAM (as compared to the TI-80&#x27;s 7 KB of RAM), and a faster 6 MHz Zilog Z80 processor (as compared with the TI-80&#x27;s 980 kHz proprietary processor). The TI-73 also uses the standard 4 AAA batteries with a lithium backup battery (instead of the TI-80&#x27;s 2 CR2032 lithium batteries).

In 2003, the TI-73 was redesigned with a new body shape and redesignated the TI-73 Explorer to indicate its currently intended use as a bridge between the TI-15 Explorer and similar calculators and the TI-83 Plus, TI-84 Plus, and similar calculators. Later, the TI-73 Explorer was remodeled to resemble the TI-84 Plus graphing calculator more closely.

Due to lack of demand in middle schools, the TI-73 and TI-73 Explorer have not been huge sellers for TI and are not carried by most retail stores. Most American upper-level middle school algebra courses generally tend to use the TI-83 or TI-84 families instead of the TI-73 or TI-73 Explorer, while most basic middle school math courses generally do not use graphing calculators, instead opting for scientific calculators such as the TI-30 or TI-34 families.

Originally the TI-73 could only run programs written in TI-BASIC, although that has changed in recent years. In 2005, an assembly shell called Mallard was released for the TI-73. Mallard allows the user to run programs written in assembly language. As with the TI-82 and the TI-85 before, a hacked backup file is downloaded containing the assembly shell.

Released in late 2008, the Windows utility Chameleon allows a user to load the TI-73 Explorer with a slightly modified TI-83+ firmware, giving it nearly equivalent functionality.

In 2009, Texas Instruments updated the skin of the TI-73 Explorer to match the shape of the larger TI-84 Plus&#x27;s case. This resulted in a slight increase in mass from 182 grams to 208 grams. The hardware and software remained unchanged and is identical to an older unit wearing the TI-83 plus style casing.

<doc id="684923" wikidata="Q297804" url="?curid=684923" title="Liliane Bettencourt">
<text>Liliane Henriette Charlotte Bettencourt (; née Schueller; 21 October 1922 – 21 September 2017) was a French heiress, socialite and businesswoman. She was a board member and one of the principal shareholders of L&#x27;Oréal. At the time of her death, she was the richest woman, and the 14th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$44.3 billion.

==Biography==
She was born Liliane Henriette Charlotte Schueller on 21 October 1922 in Paris, the only child of Louise Madeleine Berthe (&quot;née&quot; Doncieux) and Eugène Schueller, the founder of L&#x27;Oréal, one of the world&#x27;s largest cosmetics and beauty companies. When Liliane was five years old, her mother died, and she formed a close bond with her father, who later married Liliane&#x27;s British governess. At the age of 15, she joined her father&#x27;s company as an apprentice, mixing cosmetics and labelling bottles of shampoo.

In 1950, she married French politician André Bettencourt, who served as a cabinet minister in French governments of the 1960s and 1970s and rose to become deputy chairman of L&#x27;Oréal. Mr. Bettencourt had been a member of La Cagoule, a violent French fascist pro-Nazi group that Liliane&#x27;s father, a Nazi sympathizer, had funded and supported in the 1930s and whose members were arrested in 1937. After the war, her husband, like other members of La Cagoule, was given refuge at L&#x27;Oréal despite his politically inconvenient past. Eventually, the Bettencourts settled in an Art Moderne mansion built in 1951 on rue de Delabordère in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France. They had one daughter, Françoise, who was born in 1953.

In 1957, Bettencourt inherited the L&#x27;Oréal fortune when her father died, becoming the principal shareholder. In 1963, the company went public, although Bettencourt continued to own a majority stake. In 1974, in fear that the company would be nationalised after the French elections, she exchanged almost half of her stake for a three percent (3%) stake in Nestlé
S.A.

As of December 2012, Bettencourt owned 185,661,879 (30.5%) of the outstanding shares of L&#x27;Oréal, of which 76,441,389 (12.56%) shares were effectively held in trust (for her daughter). The remainder were owned as follows: 178,381,021 (29.78%) shares owned by Nestlé, 229,933,941 (37.76%) shares were publicly held, and the remainder were held as treasury stock or in the company savings plan. The Bettencourt family and Nestlé acted in concert pursuant to a shareholders&#x27; agreement. Bettencourt ended her board director tenure on 13 February 2012 and her grandson, Jean-Victor, was appointed as board director. Bettencourt&#x27;s daughter and her daughter&#x27;s husband (Jean-Pierre Meyers) are also members of the board of directors.

Bettencourt generally shunned media attention and granted few interviews. From 2007, she faced intense media scrutiny and publicity over her relationship with François-Marie Banier, the estrangement with her daughter Françoise and her alleged funding of conservative French politicians, including former French president Nicolas Sarkozy. In August 2012, she sold her private island, D&#x27;Arros Island, to a Seychelles-registered conservation business linked to the Swiss Save our Seas Foundation, for £60 million.

Bettencourt died on 21 September 2017. The funeral service was held at Église Saint-Pierre in Neuilly-sur-Seine.

==Philanthropy==
In 1987, Bettencourt, together with her husband and daughter, founded the Bettencourt Schueller Foundation (la Fondation Bettencourt Schueller) to support and develop medical, cultural and humanitarian projects. The foundation is based in Neuilly-sur-Seine. The foundation, which benefits from assets of €150 million and an annual budget of approx €15 million devotes approximately 55% of its funds to scientific education and research, 33% to humanitarian and social projects and 12% to culture and arts.

In 2008, the foundation helped fund the new Monet wing at the Musée Marmottan Monet. Conversely, in 2007 Bettencourt was jointly &quot;awarded&quot; a Black Planet Award, an award given for destroying the planet, along with Peter Brabeck-Letmathe for proliferating contaminated baby food, monopolising water resources, and tolerating child labour.

== Art collection ==
Bettencourt had an art collection that was said to include Matisse, Picasso, Fernand Léger, Derain, Soutine, Mondrian and Ruhlmann furniture.

==&quot;L&#x27;affaire Bettencourt&quot;==
By most accounts Bettencourt met François-Marie Banier, a French writer, artist and celebrity photographer, in 1987 when he was commissioned to photograph her for the French magazine &quot;Egoïste&quot;. Over the ensuing years, Banier and Bettencourt became friends and she became his benefactor, bestowing gifts upon him estimated to be worth as much as €1.3 billion. These gifts include, amongst other things, a life insurance policy worth €253 million in 2003, another life insurance policy worth €262 million in 2006, 11 works of art in 2001 valued at €20 million, including paintings by Picasso, Matisse, Mondrian, Delaunay and Léger, a photograph by surrealist Man Ray, and cash. The life insurance policies were allegedly signed over to Banier after Bettencourt was recovering from two hospital stays in 2003 and 2006. In April 2013, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine listed Liliane Bettencourt as the world&#x27;s richest woman in 1999 at a value of $30 billion.

In December 2007, just a month after the death of her father, Françoise Bettencourt Meyers lodged a criminal complaint against Banier, accusing him of &quot;abus de faiblesse&quot; (or the exploitation of a physical or psychological weakness for personal gain) over Bettencourt. As a result of her complaint, the Brigade Financière, the financial investigative arm of the French national police, opened an investigation and, after interviewing members of Bettencourt&#x27;s staff, determined to present the case to a court in Nanterre for trial in September 2009. In December 2009, the court delayed ruling on the case until April 2010 (later extended until July 2010) pending the results of a medical examination of Bettencourt&#x27;s mental state. However, Bettencourt refused to submit to these examinations.

In July 2010, the trial was adjourned again until autumn 2010, at the earliest, after details of tape recordings made by Bettencourt&#x27;s butler, Pascal Bonnefoy, became public. The tapes, which were turned over to police, consisted of over 21 hours of conversation and were made because the butler had feared that Bettencourt was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and was being duped. The tapes allegedly reveal that Bettencourt had made Banier her &quot;sole heir&quot;, excluding the L&#x27;Oréal shares which make up the bulk of Bettencourt&#x27;s estate and which had already been signed over to her daughter and two grandsons.

On 6 December 2010, Bettencourt reconciled with her daughter, ending a series of lawsuits. It is reported that Bettencourt and Banier had separated, and he was eventually written out of Bettencourt&#x27;s will. The spat reignited over the following summer, however, when Bettencourt said her daughter needed to seek psychological help, which renewed their estrangement.

===Guardianship===
On 8 June 2011, it was reported daughter Meyers had filed an application with the court to make Bettencourt a ward of the state for her health and being incapable of the management of her fortune. On 17 October 2011, a French judge ruled that she was to be placed under the guardianship of members of her family on concerns about Bettencourt&#x27;s declining mental health. Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, along with Bettencourt&#x27;s two grandsons, gained control of her wealth and property. One of the grandsons was additionally named as her personal guardian. Liliane Bettencourt&#x27;s lawyer said he would appeal, and told &quot;Le Monde&quot; newspaper that &quot;Mrs. Bettencourt was ready for &#x27;nuclear war&#x27; with her daughter.&quot; As of 2014, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers is guardian of the fortune, while Francoise&#x27;s son, L’Oréal Board member and member of the supervisory board of the Bettencourt family holding company, Tethys, Jean-Victor Meyers oversees her health and personal life after a judge determined he was the only person able to &quot;ward off all conflict between Liliane Bettencourt and Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.&quot;

==Madoff victim==
Bettencourt was reported to be one of the most high-profile victims of Bernard Madoff&#x27;s Ponzi scheme, losing €22 million. She was the first investor in a fund managed by Access International Advisors, which was co-founded by René-Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet. De la Villehuchet died by suicide on 22 December 2008, after it became known that his funds had invested a substantial amount of their capital with Madoff.

==Political scandal==
In June 2010, during the Bettencourt affair, Bettencourt became embroiled in a high-level French political scandal after other details of the tape recordings made by her butler became public. The tapes allegedly picked up conversations between Bettencourt and her financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre, which indicate that Bettencourt may have avoided paying taxes by keeping a substantial amount of cash in undeclared Swiss bank accounts. The tapes also allegedly captured a conversation between Bettencourt and French budget minister Éric Woerth, who was soliciting a job for his wife managing Bettencourt&#x27;s wealth, while running a high-profile campaign to catch wealthy tax evaders as the budget minister. Moreover, Bettencourt received a €30 million tax rebate while Woerth was budget minister.

In July 2010, the scandal widened after Bettencourt&#x27;s former accountant, Claire Thibout, alleged in an interview with the French investigative website Mediapart, that conservative French politicians were frequently given envelopes stuffed with cash at Bettencourt&#x27;s mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine. She alleged that Woerth, while acting as treasurer for the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), was given an envelope containing €150,000 in cash in March 2007 towards the presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy. She also made, then retracted, a claim that Sarkozy was a frequent visitor to the Bettencourt&#x27;s home while he was mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1983 to 2002 and received envelopes containing cash. A few days later, she declared she had been pressured by French police to retract her testimony about Sarkozy&#x27;s illegal cash. Sarkozy and Woerth both denied wrongdoing. Following these allegations, French police raided the home and office of de Maistre, who heads Clymène, the company owned by Bettencourt to manage her wealth. French law limits political donations to €7,500 for political parties and €4,600 for individuals. Contributions above €150 must be paid by cheque with the donor clearly identified.

<doc id="684924" wikidata="Q2501389" url="?curid=684924" title="The Te of Piglet">
<text>The Te of Piglet is a 1992 philosophical book written by Benjamin Hoff as a companion to his 1982 work &quot;The Tao of Pooh&quot;. The book was published by Dutton Books and spent 21 weeks on the &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Bestseller List and 40 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller List.

==Synopsis==
In &quot;The Te of Piglet&quot;, the Piglet character of the &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; books explains the Chinese concept of &quot;Te&quot;, meaning &#x27;power&#x27; or &#x27;virtue&#x27;. Hoff elucidates the Taoist concept of &#x27;Virtue—of the small&#x27;; though, he also uses it as an opportunity to elaborate on his introduction to Taoism. It is written with many embedded stories from the A. A. Milne Winnie the Pooh books, both for entertainment and because they serve as tools for explaining Taoism.

In the book Piglet is shown to possess great power—a common interpretation of the word Te, which more commonly means Virtue—not only because he is small, but also because he has a great heart or, to use a Taoist term, Tz&#x27;u. The book goes through the other characters—Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, Eeyore and Pooh—to show the various aspects of humanity that Taoism says get in the way of living in harmony with the Tao.

==Reception==
The &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; stated that although the first book was a &quot;sleeper hit&quot;, the &quot;Te of Piglet&quot; &quot;falls short as a companion to [the] Tao of Pooh&quot;. Princeton University&#x27;s Cotsen Children&#x27;s Library praised the book. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote &quot;if you like marshmallow laced with arsenic, it was worth the wait&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;Hoff&#x27;s tired attacks on the &quot;Negative News Media&quot; and on &quot;Eeyore Amazons&quot; who &quot;call themselves feminists but ... don&#x27;t like femininity&quot; weaken his presentation, but on the whole, his Taoist manifesto distills ageless personal and political wisdom, relaying an ecological message we ignore at our peril.&quot;

<doc id="684928" wikidata="Q1061108" url="?curid=684928" title="Water supply">
<text>Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities, commercial organisations, community endeavors or by individuals, usually via a system of pumps and pipes. Public water supply systems are crucial to properly functioning societies. These systems are what supply drinking water to populations around the globe. Aspects of service quality include continuity of supply, water quality and water pressure. The institutional responsibility for water supply is arranged differently in different countries and regions (urban versus rural). It usually includes issues surrounding policy and regulation, service provision and standardization.

The cost of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs (capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and chemicals). Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs.

Water supply is a separate topic from irrigation, the practice and systems of water supply on a larger scale, for a wider variety of purposes, primarily agriculture.

== Technical overview ==
Water supply systems get water from a variety of locations after appropriate treatment, including groundwater (aquifers), surface water (lakes and rivers), and the sea through desalination. The water treatment steps include, in most cases, purification, disinfection through chlorination and sometimes fluoridation. Treated water then either flows by gravity or is pumped to reservoirs, which can be elevated such as water towers or on the ground (for indicators related to the efficiency of drinking water distribution see non-revenue water). Once water is used, wastewater is typically discharged in a sewer system and treated in a sewage treatment plant before being discharged into a river, lake, or the sea or reused for landscaping or irrigation.

===Supply network===
=== Use ===

In the United States, the typical single family home uses about of water per day (2016 estimate) or per capita per day. This includes several common residential end use purposes (in decreasing order) like toilet use, showers, tap (faucet) use, washing machine use, leaks, other (unidentified), baths, and dishwasher use.
During the beginning of the 21st Century, especially in areas of urban and suburban population centers, traditional centralized infrastructure have not been able to supply sufficient quantities of water to keep up with growing demand. Among several options that have been managed are the extensive use of desalination technology, this is especially prevalent in coastal areas and in &quot;dry&quot; countries like Australia. Decentralization of water infrastructure has grown extensively as a viable solution including Rainwater harvesting and Stormwater harvesting where policies are eventually tending towards a more rational use and sourcing of water incorporation concepts such as &quot;Fit for Purpose&quot;.

== Service quality ==
Water supply service quality has many dimensions: continuity; water quality; pressure; and the degree of responsiveness of service providers to customer complaints. Many people in developing countries receive a poor or very poor quality of service.

=== Continuity of supply ===
Continuity of water supply is taken for granted in most developed countries but is a severe problem in many developing countries, where sometimes water is only provided for a few hours every day or a few days a week; that is, it is intermittent. This is especially problematic for informal settlements, which are often poorly connected to the water supply network and have no means of procuring alternative sources such as private boreholes. It is estimated that about half of the population of developing countries receives water on an intermittent basis.

=== Water quality ===

Drinking water quality has a micro-biological and a physico-chemical dimension. There are thousands of parameters of water quality. In public water supply systems water should, at a minimum, be disinfected—most commonly through the use of chlorination or the use of ultraviolet light—or it may need to undergo treatment, especially in the case of surface water. Water quality is also dependent of the quality and level of pollution of the water source.

=== Water pressure ===

Water pressures vary in different locations of a distribution system. Water mains below the street may operate at higher pressures, with a pressure reducer located at each point where the water enters a building or a house. In poorly managed systems, water pressure can be so low as to result only in a trickle of water or so high that it leads to damage to plumbing fixtures and waste of water. Pressure in an urban water system is typically maintained either by a pressurised water tank serving an urban area, by pumping the water up into a water tower and relying on gravity to maintain a constant pressure in the system or solely by pumps at the water treatment plant and repeater pumping stations.

Typical UK pressures are 4–5 bar (60–70 PSI) for an urban supply. However, some people can get over eight bars or below one bar. A single iron main pipe may cross a deep valley, it will have the same nominal pressure, however each consumer will get a bit more or less because of the hydrostatic pressure (about 1 bar/10 m height). So people at the bottom of a hill will get about 3 bars more than those at the top.

The effective pressure also varies because of the pressure loss due to supply resistance, even for the same static pressure. An urban consumer may have 5 metres of 15-mm pipe running from the iron main, so the kitchen tap flow will be fairly unrestricted. A rural consumer may have a kilometre of rusted and limed 22-mm iron pipe, so their kitchen tap flow will be small.

For this reason, the UK domestic water system has traditionally (prior to 1989) employed a &quot;cistern feed&quot; system, where the incoming supply is connected to the kitchen sink and also a header/storage tank in the attic. Water can dribble into this tank through a 12 mm pipe, plus ball valve, and then supply the house on 22 or 28 mm pipes. Gravity water has a small pressure (say bar in the bathroom) so needs wide pipes to allow for higher flows. This is fine for baths and toilets but is frequently inadequate for showers. A booster pump or a hydrophore is installed to increase and maintain pressure. For this reason urban houses are increasingly using mains pressure boilers (&quot;combies&quot;) which take a long time to fill a bath but suit the high back pressure of a shower.

== Institutional responsibility and governance ==
A great variety of institutions have responsibilities in water supply. A basic distinction is between institutions responsible for policy and regulation on the one hand; and institutions in charge of providing services on the other hand.

=== Policy and regulation ===

Water supply policies and regulation are usually defined by one or several Ministries, in consultation with the legislative branch. In the United States the United States Environmental Protection Agency, whose administrator reports directly to the President, is responsible for water and sanitation policy and standard setting within the executive branch. In other countries responsibility for sector policy is entrusted to a Ministry of Environment (such as in Mexico and Colombia), to a Ministry of Health (such as in Panama, Honduras and Uruguay), a Ministry of Public Works (such as in Ecuador and Haiti), a Ministry of Economy (such as in German states) or a Ministry of Energy (such as in Iran). A few countries, such as Jordan and Bolivia, even have a Ministry of Water. Often several Ministries share responsibilities for water supply.

In the European Union, important policy functions have been entrusted to the supranational level. Policy and regulatory functions include the setting of tariff rules and the approval of tariff increases; setting, monitoring and enforcing norms for quality of service and environmental protection; benchmarking the performance of service providers; and reforms in the structure of institutions responsible for service provision. The distinction between policy functions and regulatory functions is not always clear-cut. In some countries they are both entrusted to Ministries, but in others regulatory functions are entrusted to agencies that are separate from Ministries.

==== Regulatory agencies ====

Dozens of countries around the world have established regulatory agencies for infrastructure services, including often water supply and sanitation, in order to better protect consumers and to improve efficiency. Regulatory agencies can be entrusted with a variety of responsibilities, including in particular the approval of tariff increases and the management of sector information systems, including benchmarking systems. Sometimes they also have a mandate to settle complaints by consumers that have not been dealt with satisfactorily by service providers. These specialized entities are expected to be more competent and objective in regulating service providers than departments of government Ministries. Regulatory agencies are supposed to be autonomous from the executive branch of government, but in many countries have often not been able to exercise a great degree of autonomy.

In the United States regulatory agencies for utilities have existed for almost a century at the level of states, and in Canada at the level of provinces. In both countries they cover several infrastructure sectors. In many U.S. states they are called Public Utility Commissions. For England and Wales, a regulatory agency for water (OFWAT) was created as part of the privatization of the water industry in 1989. In many developing countries, water regulatory agencies were created during the 1990s in parallel with efforts at increasing private sector participation. (for more details on regulatory agencies in Latin America, for example, please see Water and sanitation in Latin America and the regional association of water regulatory agencies ADERASA.)

Many countries do not have regulatory agencies for water. In these countries service providers are regulated directly by local government, or the national government. This is, for example, the case in the countries of continental Europe, in China and India.

=== Service provision ===
Water supply service providers, which are often utilities, differ from each other in terms of their geographical coverage relative to administrative boundaries; their sectoral coverage; their ownership structure; and their governance arrangements.

==== Geographical coverage ====

Many water utilities provide services in a single city, town or municipality. However, in many countries municipalities have associated in regional or inter-municipal or multi-jurisdictional utilities to benefit from economies of scale. In the United States these can take the form of special-purpose districts which may have independent taxing authority. An example of a multi-jurisdictional water utility in the United States is WASA, a utility serving Washington, D.C. and various localities in the state of Maryland. Multi-jurisdictional utilities are also common in Germany, where they are known as &quot;Zweckverbaende&quot;, in France and in Italy.

In some federal countries, there are water service providers covering most or all cities and towns in an entire state, such as in all states of Brazil and some states in Mexico (see Water supply and sanitation in Mexico). In England and Wales, water supply and sewerage is supplied almost entirely through ten regional companies. Some smaller countries, especially developed countries, have established service providers that cover the entire country or at least most of its cities and major towns. Such national service providers are especially prevalent in West Africa and Central America, but also exist, for example, in Tunisia, Jordan and Uruguay (see also water supply and sanitation in Uruguay). In rural areas, where about half the world population lives, water services are often not provided by utilities, but by community-based organizations which usually cover one or sometimes several villages.

==== Sector coverage ====
Some water utilities provide only water supply services, while sewerage is under the responsibility of a different entity. This is for example the case in Tunisia. However, in most cases water utilities also provide sewer and sewage treatment services. In some cities or countries utilities also distribute electricity. In a few cases such multi-utilities also collect solid waste and provide local telephone services. An example of such an integrated utility can be found in the Colombian city of Medellín. Utilities that provide water, sanitation and electricity can be found in Frankfurt, Germany (Mainova), in Casablanca, Morocco and in Gabon in West Africa. Multi-utilities provide certain benefits such as common billing and the option to cross-subsidize water services with revenues from electricity sales, if permitted by law.

==== Ownership and governance arrangements ====
Water supply providers can be either public, private, mixed or cooperative. Most urban water supply services around the world are provided by public entities. As Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange (2002) stated, &quot;The water crisis that is affecting so many people is mainly a crisis of governance—not of water scarcity.&quot; The introduction of cost-reflective tariffs together with cross-subsidization between richer and poorer consumers is an essential governance reform in order to reduce the high levels of Unaccounted-for Water (UAW) and to provide the finance needed to extend the network to those poorest households who remain unconnected. Partnership arrangements between the public and private sector can play an important role in order to achieve this objective.

===== Private sector participation =====
An estimated 10 percent of urban water supply is provided by private or mixed public-private companies, usually under concessions, leases or management contracts. Under these water service contract arrangements the public entity that is legally responsible for service provision delegates certain or all aspects of service provision to the private service provider for a period typically ranging from 4 to 30 years. The public entity continues to own the assets. These arrangements are common in France and in Spain. Only in few parts of the world water supply systems have been completely sold to the private sector (privatization), such as in England and Wales as well as in Chile. The largest private water companies in the world are Suez and Veolia Environnement from France; &quot;Aguas de Barcelona&quot; from Spain; and Thames Water from the UK, all of which are engaged internationally (see links to website of these companies below). In recent years, a number of cities have reverted to the public sector in a process called &quot;remunicipalization&quot;.

===== Public water service provision =====
90% of urban water supply and sanitation services are currently in the public sector. They are owned by the state or local authorities, or also by collectives or cooperatives. They run without an aim for profit but are based on the ethos of providing a common good considered to be of public interest. In most middle and low-income countries, these publicly owned and managed water providers can be inefficient as a result of political interference, leading to over-staffing and low labor productivity. 

Ironically, the main losers from this institutional arrangement are the urban poor in these countries. Because they are not connected to the water supply network, they end up paying far more per liter of water than do more well-off households connected to the network who benefit from the implicit subsidies that they receive from loss-making utilities.

The fact that we are still so far from achieving universal access to clean water and sanitation shows that public water authorities, in their current state, are not working well enough.
Yet some are being very successful and are modelling the best forms of public management. As Ryutaro Hashimoto, former Japanese Prime Minister, notes: &quot;Public water services currently provide more than 90 percent of water supply in the world. Modest improvement in public water operators will have immense impact on global provision of services.&quot;

===== Governance arrangements =====
Governance arrangements for both public and private utilities can take many forms (Kurian and McCarney, 2010). Governance arrangements define the relationship between the service provider, its owners, its customers and regulatory entities. They determine the financial autonomy of the service provider and thus its ability to maintain its assets, expand services, attract and retain qualified staff, and ultimately to provide high-quality services. Key aspects of governance arrangements are the extent to which the entity in charge of providing services is insulated from arbitrary political intervention; and whether there is an explicit mandate and political will to allow the service provider to recover all or at least most of its costs through tariffs and retain these revenues. If water supply is the responsibility of a department that is integrated in the administration of a city, town or municipality, there is a risk that tariff revenues are diverted for other purposes. In some cases, there is also a risk that staff are appointed mainly on political grounds rather than based on their professional credentials.

=== Standardization ===
International standards for water supply system are covered by International Classification of Standards (ICS) 91.140.60.

=== Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers ===
Comparing the performance of water and sanitation service providers (utilities) is needed, because the sector offers limited scope for direct competition (natural monopoly). Firms operating in competitive markets are under constant pressure to out perform each other. Water utilities are often sheltered from this pressure, and it frequently shows: some utilities are on a sustained improvement track, but many others keep falling further behind best practice. Benchmarking the performance of utilities allows the stimulation of competition, establish realistic targets for improvement and create pressure to catch up with better utilities. Information on benchmarks for water and sanitation utilities is provided by the International Benchmarking Network for Water and Sanitation Utilities.

== Financial aspects ==

=== Costs and financing ===
The cost of supplying water consists, to a very large extent, of fixed costs (capital costs and personnel costs) and only to a small extent of variable costs that depend on the amount of water consumed (mainly energy and chemicals). The full cost of supplying water in urban areas in developed countries is about US$1–2 per cubic meter depending on local costs and local water consumption levels. The cost of sanitation (sewerage and wastewater treatment) is another US$1–2 per cubic meter. These costs are somewhat lower in developing countries. Throughout the world, only part of these costs is usually billed to consumers, the remainder being financed through direct or indirect subsidies from local, regional or national governments (see section on tariffs).

Besides subsidies water supply investments are financed through internally generated revenues as well as through debt. Debt financing can take the form of credits from commercial Banks, credits from international financial institutions such as the World Bank and regional development banks (in the case of developing countries), and bonds (in the case of some developed countries and some upper middle-income countries).

=== Tariffs ===
Almost all service providers in the world charge tariffs to recover part of their costs. According to estimates by the World Bank the average (mean) global water tariff is US$0.53 per cubic meter. In developed countries the average tariff is US$1.04, while it is only U$0.11 in the poorest developing countries. The lowest tariffs in developing countries are found in South Asia (mean of US$0.09/m3), while the highest are found in Latin America (US$0.41/m3). Data for 132 cities were assessed. The tariff is estimate for a consumption level of 15 cubic meters per month. Few utilities do recover all their costs. According to the same World Bank study only 30% of utilities globally, and only 50% of utilities in developed countries, generate sufficient revenue to cover operation, maintenance and partial capital costs.

According to another study undertaken in 2006 by NUS Consulting, the average water and sewerage tariff in 14 mainly OECD countries excluding VAT varied between US$0.66 per cubic meter in the United States and the equivalent of US$2.25 per cubic meter in Denmark. However, water consumption is much higher in the US than in Europe. Therefore, residential water bills may be very similar, even if the tariff per unit of consumption tends to be higher in Europe than in the US.

A typical family on the US East Coast paid between US$30 and US$70 per month for water and sewer services in 2005.

In developing countries, tariffs are usually much further from covering costs. Residential water bills for a typical consumption of 15 cubic meters per month vary between less than US$1 and US$12 per month.

Water and sanitation tariffs, which are almost always billed together, can take many different forms. Where meters are installed, tariffs are typically volumetric (per usage), sometimes combined with a small monthly fixed charge. In the absence of meters, flat or fixed rates—which are independent of actual consumption—are being charged. In developed countries, tariffs are usually the same for different categories of users and for different levels of consumption.

In developing countries, the situation is often characterized by cross-subsidies with the intent to make water more affordable for residential low-volume users that are assumed to be poor. For example, industrial and commercial users are often charged higher tariffs than public or residential users. Also, metered users are often charged higher tariffs for higher levels of consumption (increasing-block tariffs). However, cross-subsidies between residential users do not always reach their objective. Given the overall low level of water tariffs in developing countries even at higher levels of consumption, most consumption subsidies benefit the wealthier segments of society. Also, high industrial and commercial tariffs can provide an incentive for these users to supply water from other sources than the utility (own wells, water tankers) and thus actually erode the utility&#x27;s revenue base.

=== Investments needed in developing countries ===

Water supply and sanitation require a huge amount of capital investment in infrastructure such as pipe networks, pumping stations and water treatment works. It is estimated that in developing countries investments of at least US$200 billion have to be made per year to replace aging water infrastructure to guarantee supply, reduce leakage rates and protect water quality.

International attention has focused upon the needs of developing countries. To meet the Millennium Development Goals targets of halving the proportion of the population lacking access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015, current annual investment on the order of US$10 to US$15 billion would need to be roughly doubled. This does not include investments required for the maintenance of existing infrastructure.

Once infrastructure is in place, operating water supply and sanitation systems entails significant ongoing costs to cover personnel, energy, chemicals, maintenance and other expenses. The sources of money to meet these capital and operational costs are essentially either user fees, public funds or some combination of the two. It is also important to consider is the flexibility of the water supply system.

== Metering ==
Metering of water supply is usually motivated by one or several of four objectives. First, it provides an incentive to conserve water which protects water resources (environmental objective). Second, it can postpone costly system expansion and saves energy and chemical costs (economic objective). Third, it allows a utility to better locate distribution losses (technical objective). Fourth, it allows suppliers to charge for water based on use, which is perceived by many as the fairest way to allocate the costs of water supply to users. Metering is considered good practice in water supply and is widespread in developed countries, except for the United Kingdom. In developing countries it is estimated that half of all urban water supply systems are metered and the tendency is increasing.

Water meters are read by one of several methods:
* the water customer writes down the meter reading and mails in a postcard with this info to the water department;
* the water customer writes down the meter reading and uses a phone dial-in system to transfer this info to the water department;
* the water customer logs into the website of the water supply company, enters the address, meter ID and meter readings 
* a meter reader comes to the premises and enters the meter reading into a handheld computer;
* the meter reading is echoed on a display unit mounted to the outside of the premises, where a meter reader records them;
* a small radio is hooked up to the meter to automatically transmit readings to corresponding receivers in handheld computers, utility vehicles or distributed collectors
* a small computer is hooked up to the meter that can either dial out or receive automated phone calls that give the reading to a central computer system.

Most cities are increasingly installing automatic meter reading (AMR) systems to prevent fraud, to lower ever-increasing labor and liability costs and to improve customer service and satisfaction.

== History ==
Throughout history, people have devised systems to make getting and using water more convenient. Living in semi-arid regions, ancient Persians in the 1st millennium BC used qanat system to gain access to water in the mountains. Early Rome had indoor plumbing, meaning a system of aqueducts and pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains for people to use.

Until the Enlightenment era, little progress was made in water supply and sanitation and the engineering skills of the Romans were largely neglected throughout Europe. It was in the 18th century that a rapidly growing population fueled a boom in the establishment of private water supply networks in London. London water supply infrastructure developed over many centuries from early mediaeval conduits, through major 19th-century treatment works built in response to cholera threats, to modern, large-scale reservoirs. The first screw-down water tap was patented in 1845 by Guest and Chrimes, a brass foundry in Rotherham.

The first documented use of sand filters to purify the water supply dates to 1804, when the owner of a bleachery in Paisley, Scotland, John Gibb, installed an experimental filter, selling his unwanted surplus to the public. The first treated public water supply in the world was installed by engineer James Simpson for the Chelsea Waterworks Company in London in 1829. The practice of water treatment soon became mainstream, and the virtues of the system were made starkly apparent after the investigations of the physician John Snow during the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak demonstrated the role of the water supply in spreading the cholera epidemic.

<doc id="684929" wikidata="Q11984849" url="?curid=684929" title="Self-hatred">
<text>Self-hatred is a state of personal self-loathing or low self-esteem.

==In psychology and psychiatry==
The term &quot;self-hatred&quot; is used infrequently by psychologists and psychiatrists, who would usually describe people who hate themselves as &quot;people with low self-esteem&quot;. Self-hatred, self-guilt and shame are important factors in some or many mental disorders, especially disorders that involve a perceived defect of oneself (e.g. body dysmorphic disorder). Self-hatred is also a symptom of many personality disorders, including borderline personality disorder, as well as mood disorders like depression. It can also be linked to guilt for someone&#x27;s own actions that they view as wrongful, e.g., survivor guilt.

==In social groups==
Self-hatred by members of ethnic groups, gender groups, and religions is postulated to be a result of internalization of hatred of those groups from dominant cultures.

=== Ethnic groups ===
=== Women ===
=== Jews ===

Theodor Lessing, in his book, &quot;Jewish Self-Hatred&quot; (1930), identified this as a pathology, “a manifestation of an over identification with the dominant culture and internalization of its prejudices.” There have been studies from sources stated in the scholarly research, “mental illness in Jews often derived from feelings of inferiority and self-hatred resulting from persecution and their subordinate position in society.”

The term has been used to label American Jews accused of hiding their identity “by converting or intermarrying and raising their children in another faith” to overcome sociopolitical barriers due to antisemitism in the United States.

=== LGBT+ individuals ===

Internalized homophobia refers to negative stereotypes, beliefs, stigma, and prejudice about homosexuality and LGBT people that a person with same-sex attraction turns inward on themselves, whether or not they identify as LGBT.

==Related concepts==

=== Self-deprecation ===
Self-deprecation is the act of belittling, undervaluing, or disparaging oneself, or being excessively modest. It can be used in humor and tension release, but it also can be used to normalize self-hatred, which can be a problem.

=== Self-harm ===

Self-harm is a condition where subjects may feel compelled to physically injure themselves as an outlet for depression, anxiety, or anger, and is related with numerous psychological disorders.

In some cases, self-harm can lead to accidental death or suicide. It is not a definitive indicator, however, of a desire either to commit suicide or even of its consideration.

<text>TI-15 Explorer is a calculator designed by Texas Instruments, intended for use in classes from grades 3–6. It is the successor to the TI-12 Math Explorer. For younger students, TI recommends the use of the TI-108. For older students, TI recommends the use of the TI-73 Explorer.

Features include a 2-line pixel display (as opposed to the 7-segment display of several other calculators) and a quiz-like &quot;problem-solving&quot; mode with 3 difficulty levels. It also supports limited scientific capabilities, such as parentheses, fixed decimal, fractions, pi, and exponents.

<doc id="684942" wikidata="Q7873722" url="?curid=684942" title="USS Sacramento (1862)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Sacramento&quot; was a sloop-of-war in the United States Navy.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was launched on 28 April 1862 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine; sponsored by a Mrs. Tilton of Boston; and commissioned on 7 January 1863, Commander Andrew E. K. Benham in command.

==Civil War, 1863-1865==
&quot;Sacramento&quot;″s first assignment was blockade duty off the North Carolina coast as part of the effort to eliminate Confederate shipping operations at Wilmington. During her cruising off the Western Bar at Wilmington on 1 May 1863, she captured the British blockade runner &quot;Wanderer&quot;. Ordered to European waters after refitting, &quot;Sacramento&quot; departed Boston on 2 February 1864, calling at the Azores, Cape Town, and the Canary Islands before arriving at Cherbourg, France on 5 July. Subsequently, she cruised off the British and French coasts in the search for Confederate vessels engaged in both commerce raiding and blockade running operations. On 16 August, she collided with and sank the Norwegian brig &quot;Ceres&quot; in the English Channel south south west of Plymouth, Devon. &quot;Sacramento&quot; rescued her crew. She collided with, and severely damaged, the Swedish schooner &quot;Victor&quot; on 22 August and subsequently put in to Vlissingen, Zeeland, Netherlands. &quot;Sacramento&quot; assisted in blockading the Confederate gun vessel detained at Calais, France, in early 1865, and in March joined off Ferrol, Spain, to observe the movements of the formidable Confederate casemate turret ram &quot;Stonewall&quot; bound for Cuba from Bordeaux, France. Departing Queenstown, Ireland on 25 July, after the conclusion of hostilities in home waters, &quot;Sacramento&quot; arrived at Boston on 12 August. Decommissioned on 21 August at the Boston Navy Yard, she remained inactive into 1866.

==Voyage to East Asia, 1866-1867==
Recommissioned on 17 September 1866, &quot;Sacramento&quot; was assigned to special service in Chinese and Japanese waters. Outward bound via the Cape of Good Hope, the sloop called at Madeira before arriving at Monrovia, Liberia. &quot;Sacramento&quot; embarked President Warner of Liberia, members of his government, and Maryland Senator John Marshall at Monrovia on 15 January for passage down the African coast to Cape Palmas. Subsequently, &quot;Sacramento&quot; proceeded southward, calling at St. George del Mina, Dutch Guinea; St. Thomas; St. Paul Loando; Cape Town; and Madras, India. Soon after departing Madras, &quot;Sacramento&quot; grounded on 19 June 1867 on reefs at the mouth of the Godavari River, now in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Although battered into a total wreck, all hands from &quot;Sacramento&quot; were saved and eventually embarked aboard SS &quot;General Caulfield&quot; which arrived in New York on 19 November.

<doc id="684945" wikidata="Q646459" url="?curid=684945" title="Doink the Clown">
<text>Doink the Clown is a professional wrestling gimmick originally and most popularly portrayed by Matt Borne, who debuted the Doink persona in the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in 1992. Doink is a clown wearing traditional clown makeup (or a mask decorated to resemble such) and brightly colored clothes. In addition to Borne, Doink has been portrayed occasionally by other wrestlers in the WWE and unofficially on the independent circuit.

==Character history==

===World Wrestling Federation (1992–1995, 1997)===

Former WWE producer Bruce Prichard said in an interview on &quot;The Steve Austin Show&quot; that Michael Hegstrand had originally conceived the idea of a miserable clown character.

After making appearances in late 1992 in the crowd and at ringside, playing tricks on the fans and wrestlers, the Doink character made his in-ring debut in the WWF in 1993; he originally wrestled as a technically sound heel. Doink played cruel jokes on both fans and wrestlers to both amuse himself and catch his victims off-guard. Some of his villainous pranks included tripping Big Boss Man with a tripwire, &quot;accidentally&quot; poking Tatanka in the eye with a mop, dumping water on Marty Jannetty and attacking Crush with a loaded prosthetic arm. He clashed with Crush at WrestleMania IX, a match which he won after the appearance of an identical Doink (played by Steve Keirn) from underneath the ring. Doink also wrestled Randy Savage on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, and substituted for Jerry Lawler, who faked an injury, against Bret Hart at SummerSlam in 1993.

Shortly after SummerSlam, Doink slowly began showing signs of a face turn, on the September 13 episode of Raw, he threw a bucket of water on Bobby Heenan resulting in Heenan suffering a (kayfabe) cold. He also turned on Lawler on the September 26 episode of &quot;WWF Wrestling Challenge&quot; in Lawler&#x27;s The King&#x27;s Court segment, making Burger King jokes to amuse the crowd and eventually emptied a bucket of water over Lawler.

Later in September 1993, he officially turned face by throwing confetti and water on Bam Bam Bigelow and his on screen girlfriend Luna Vachon starting a comedy feud. At Survivor Series Doink got The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission and their manager Oscar disguised as him and defeated Bigelow, Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers in a comedy elimination match.

Around this time Matt Borne who played the heel version of Doink (also appeared a few times as babyface Doink) was fired due to failing a drug test and Steve Lombardi took over for Doink at house shows and at Survivor Series, Ray Apollo officially debuted as Doink over the video wall teasing Bigelow and Vachon. 

After Survivor Series, Doink was paired with a midget sidekick named Dink who was given to him by Santa Claus and Doink continued his feud with Bigelow with which ended at WrestleMania X where he and Dink lost to Bigelow and Vachon in a mixed tag team match. 

After the feud with Bigelow ended, Doink was placed in a short feud with Jeff Jarrett where Jerry Lawler interviewed Dink and told everyone that Doink was on vacation but Doink came out nowhere and attacked Dink which many people thought Doink was turning heel again but Doink removed his green hair and revealed himself to be Jarrett. 

In summer 1994, Doink restarted his feud with Lawler where he and Dink got two more midget sidekicks Wink and Pink and formed &quot;Clowns R Us&quot; (a play on toy store Toys &quot;R&quot; Us) and Lawler got his own midget sidekicks Queasy, Sleezy and Cheesy and formed &quot;The Royal Family&quot; and the two teams fought at Survivor Series in which The Royal Family won. 

In early 1995, Doink became a jobber to the stars and after Dink was released from the WWF in June 1995. Doink was losing to big stars such as Waylon Mercy and Hunter Hearst-Helmsley and Ray Apollo was officially released after his loss to Helmsley in September 1995.

Steve Lombardi took over after Apollo was released and worked in house shows. Last WWF match as Doink was on March 9, 1996 when defeated Zip on a WWF house show in Bangalore, India.

At The Slammy Awards in 1997, Doink (this time played by Steve Lombardi) made a surprise return and was attacked by Stone Cold Steve Austin and The New Blackjacks.

===Midwest Territorial Wrestling (1994)===

Doink (Matt Osborne) also had a few matches in 1994 in southeast Michigan. He faced off against Bastion Booger on July 14, 1994, in Port Huron, Michigan. He also wrestled alongside some other now known names such as Al Snow and Terry Funk when wrestling for MTW.

===Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994)===
Following his departure from the WWF, Osborne appeared (as Matt Borne) in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) for several matches as Doink in a blue and green clown suit, setting up an angle where ECW champion Shane Douglas criticized Vince McMahon for turning a talented wrestler like Borne into a comic relief character, and claimed that he knew how to bring out Borne&#x27;s full potential. Borne then made a few appearances with Douglas as &quot;himself&quot;, sporting his face half-painted with the Doink makeup. His ring name under this gimmick was &quot;Borne Again&quot;.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2001–2012)===
Since 1997, Doink has appeared sporadically in WWE. Ray Apollo returned to play him in the Gimmick Battle Royal at WrestleMania X-Seven. On December 10, 2007, Doink, played by Matt Borne for the final time, participated in a battle royal of 15 WWE alumni for the &quot;Raw&quot; 15th anniversary special episode.

Played by Nick Dinsmore, he showed up in the A.P.A. Bar Room Brawl at Vengeance in 2003. He was selected by Rhino to face Chris Benoit on the July 31, 2003 &quot;Smackdown!&quot;.

Played by Steve Lombardi, he wrestled Rob Conway on an October 2005 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On June 2, 2007, Doink, Eugene and Kane defeated Umaga, Viscera and Kevin Thorn on &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXIV&quot;. On the July 12, 2010 &quot;Raw&quot;, Doink teamed with William Regal, Primo and Zack Ryder to lose to Santino Marella, Goldust, Vladimir Kozlov and The Great Khali, when he was pinned by Khali. On the July 2, 2012 &quot;Raw&quot;, he made a surprise return and lost to Heath Slater. He reappeared on July 23, alongside several other WWE alumni, to help Lita take down Slater on &quot;WWE Raw 1000&quot;, the one thousandth episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

At Money in the Bank 2020 on May 10, Doink briefly appeared from behind a chair after Daniel Bryan performed &quot;Yes Kicks&quot; on Baron Corbin with encouragement from Otis, after which, Bryan attacked Otis. This is, to date, Doink&#x27;s final official appearance on WWE television.

===Independent circuit (2010–present)===
In early 2010, Osborne reinvented the Doink character to resemble Heath Ledger&#x27;s portrayal of the Joker in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, nicknaming the incarnation &#x27;Reborne Again&#x27;. The new character debuted on March 27 for ISPW in New Jersey. On May 23, 2010, Doink the Clown, portrayed by Dusty Wolfe, interfered against Skandor Akbar and his men Dr. Knuckles and Rommel. This caused them to lose the Wrecking Ball Wrestling tag titles. In retaliation Akbar called on the original Doink Matt Borne. Wolfe and Borne were scheduled to meet on August 15, but Wolfe never arrived at the event. On August 8, 2010, Borne, as Doink the Clown, won the Wrecking Ball Wrestling Championship.

<text>Gérard Henri de Vaucouleurs (25 April 1918 – 7 October 1995) was a French astronomer best known for his studies of galaxies.

==Life and career==
Gérard de Vaucouleurs was born on April 25, 1918 in Paris, he took the maiden name of his mother as his last name. He had an early interest in amateur astronomy and received his undergraduate degree in 1939 at the Sorbonne in that city.

After military service in World War II, he resumed his pursuit of astronomy. He was married to fellow astronomer Antoinette de Vaucouleurs on October 31, 1944, and the couple would frequently collaborate on astronomical research.

He was fluent in English and spent 1949-51 in England and 1951–57 in Australia at Mount Stromlo Observatory. He was at Lowell Observatory in Arizona from 1957-1958 and at Harvard from 1958-60.

In 1960 he was appointed to the University of Texas at Austin, where he spent the rest of his career. He was one of the first five faculty in the newly formed astronomy department there.

== Research ==
His earliest work had concerned the planet Mars and while at Harvard he used telescope observations from 1909 to 1958 to study the areographic coordinates of features on the surface of Mars. His later work focused on the study of galaxies and he co-authored the &quot;Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies&quot; with his wife Antoinette (1921-1987), a fellow UT Austin astronomer and lifelong collaborator.

His specialty included reanalyzing Hubble and Sandage&#x27;s galaxy atlas and recomputing the distance measurements utilizing a method of averaging many different kinds of metrics such as luminosity, the diameters of ring galaxies, brightest star clusters, etc., in a method he called &quot;spreading the risks.&quot; During the 1950s he promoted the idea that galactic clusters are grouped into superclusters.

The &quot;de Vaucouleurs modified Hubble sequence&quot; is a widely used variant of the standard Hubble sequence.

De Vaucouleurs was awarded the Henry Norris Russell Lectureship by the American Astronomical Society in 1988. He was awarded the Prix Jules Janssen of the Société astronomique de France (Astronomical Society of France) in the same year. He and his wife and longtime collaborator, Antoinette, together produced 400 research and technical papers, 20 books and 100 articles for laymen.

<text>Nargis Dutt (née Fatima Rashid, also known as Nirmala Dutt; 1 June 1929 – 3 May 1981) known mononyomusly as Nargis was an Indian actress and politician who worked in Hindi cinema. Regarded as one of the finest and greatest actresses in the history of Indian cinema, Nargis often portrayed sophisticated and independent women in a range of genres, from screwball comedy to literary drama. She was among the highest paid actresses of the 1950s and 1960s.

In a career spanning three decades, Nargis made her screen debut in a minor role at the age of six with &quot;Talash-E-Haq&quot; (1935), but her acting career actually began with the film &quot;Tamanna&quot; (1942). Nargis had her first leading role with &quot;Taqdeer&quot; (1943). Nargis had her breakthrough with the romance film (1949) and the musical &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1949). Following this she starred in Raj Kapoor&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951), which was a major critical and financial success. After a brief setback in the early 1950s, she reemerged with the comedy-drama &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955) and the romantic comedy &quot;Chori Chori&quot; (1956). Nargis starred in Mehboob Khan&#x27;s Oscar-nominated epic drama &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), the highest-grossing film in India at that point of time, for which she won Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Her last film was the drama &quot;Raat Aur Din&quot; (1967), for which she received the inaugural National Film Award for Best Actress.

Nargis married her &quot;Mother India&quot; co-star Sunil Dutt in 1958. Together they had three children, including the actor Sanjay Dutt. Along with her husband, Nargis formed the Ajanta Arts Culture Troupe which hired several leading actors and singers of the time and held stage shows at border areas. In the early 1970s, Nargis became the first patron of The Spastic Society of India and her subsequent work with the organisation brought her recognition as a social worker and later a Rajya Sabha nomination in 1980.

Nargis died in 1981 of pancreatic cancer, only three days before her son Sanjay Dutt made his debut in Hindi films with the film &quot;Rocky&quot;. In 1982, the &quot;Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation&quot; was established in her memory. The award for Best Feature Film on National Integration in the Annual Film Awards ceremony is called the Nargis Dutt Award in her honour. In 2011, &quot;Rediff.com&quot; listed her as the greatest Indian actress of all time.

==Early life==
Nargis was born on 1 June, 1929 as Fatima Rashid in Calcutta, in the Bengal Presidency of British India (now Kolkata, West Bengal, India) into a Punjabi Muslim family. Her father Abdul Rashid, formerly Mohanchand Uttamchand (&quot;Mohan Babu&quot;), was originally a wealthy Mohyal Brahmin heir from Rawalpindi (now in Punjab, Pakistan), who had converted from Hinduism to Islam. Her mother was Jaddanbai Hussain, born in Benares State (now in Uttar Pradesh, India), into a Punjabi Muslim family of Hindu Brahmin origin, which had converted to Islam; and was a Hindustani classical music singer, becoming one of the early pioneers of Indian cinema. Nargis&#x27; family had moved from to Punjab to Allahabad in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (now in Uttar Pradesh, India) before settling in Calcutta, Bengal. She introduced Nargis into the movie culture unfolding in India at the time. Nargis&#x27; maternal half-brother, Anwar Hussain, was also a film actor.

==Career==
=== 1935 - 1948: Film debut and breakthrough ===
Fatima made her first film appearance in the 1935 film &quot;Talashe Haq&quot; when she was six years old, credited as Baby Nargis. Nargis ( ) is a Persian word meaning Narcissus, the daffodil flower. She was subsequently credited as Nargis in all of her films.

Nargis appeared in numerous films after her debut. In 1943 at the age of 14, she appeared in Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Taqdeer,&quot; opposite Motilal. The film was a box office success, and she was extensively praised for her performance. &quot;Filmindia&quot; referred to it as &quot;an excellent debut&quot;. Following &quot;Taqdeer,&quot; Nargis starred in the 1944 film Anban. Nargis next starred in the 1945 period drama &quot;Humayun,&quot; opposite the leading actor of those times, Ashok Kumar and the mythological film &quot;Ramayani.&quot; In 1946 she starred in Nargis. These films were moderately successful.

In 1948, she made her first collaboration with Raj Kapoor, the drama Aag, in which she portrays a homeless woman who becomes an actress. The film was not a major success and did average business at the box office. However this marked the first of more than a dozen films in which Raj Kapoor and Nargis appeared together. She also starred in highly successful tragedy film Mela, the editor of &quot;Filmindia&quot;, Baburao Patel praised her performance, but in her role of mother found her &quot;unconvincing&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot;, The reported box office gross for the film according to IBOS was ₹50 lakhs in 1948. The adjusted gross as of 2015 is roughly estimated at ₹340.44 crores. Her last film of the year was &quot;Anokha Pyar,&quot; which was not a success.

=== 1949 - 1954: Rise to prominence, success and setback ===
In 1949, Nargis starred in Mehboob Khan&#x27;s critically acclaimed drama &quot;Andaz&quot;. The film saw her playing Neena, whose husband Rajan (Raj Kapoor) suspects of her having an affair with her friend Dilip (Dilip Kumar). It had a slow start at the box office, but as soon as positive word-of-mouth spread, it emerged as a major commercial success and the highest-grossing film of all time. The film was first hit in Kapoor&#x27;s career, and a breakthrough for Nargis and Kumar. Following this she starred in &quot;Barsaat&quot;, directed by Kapoor starred Nargis as a village belle and Kapoor as a poet. The film was the debut of Nimmi, who would later become a well-known actress. Its release was already hyped due to the huge success of &quot;Andaz,&quot; and therefore it became another major box office success. &quot;Barsaat&quot; was the highest-grossing film of 1949, as well as of all time, breaking the record of &quot;Andaz&quot;.

She followed this with roles in the 1950 films &quot;Meena Bazaar,&quot; the romantic drama &quot;Jogan, Jan Pahechan,&quot; the musical drama &quot;Babul,&quot; and &quot;Aadhi Raat.&quot; Both Jogan and Babul were box office hits and her performance in Babul was specially noticed. Following this she starred in the drama films Hulchul and Deedar (both 1951). Due to the success of &quot;Andaz&quot; and &quot;Barsaat&quot;, Raj Kapoor was impressed by Nargis&#x27; onscreen charm and presence. He therefore chose her to play a character in &quot;Awaara&quot; (1951) (often written as &quot;Awāra&quot;). Although it revolved around a father and his estranged son, Nargis played the pivotal role of a lawyer who knows the truth that Raj (played by Kapoor) and Raghunath (played by Prithviraj Kapoor) are son-father. Unlike the roles played by other actresses of those times, Nargis portrayed an outspoken woman-lawyer who criticises the people who regard woman as a &quot;thing made for household chores&quot;. She was also seen donning a swimwear in a scene from &quot;Awaara,&quot; a bold outfit for an Indian woman to wear in that era. The film was released on 14 December 1951, receiving universal acclaim for the performances of Prithviraj, Raj and Nargis. Not only in India, the film was a blockbuster overseas too, making Nargis and Raj well-known stars in countries such as Greece and the United States. Grossing 12.5 million in India, it became the highest-grossing film of all time, breaking the record of &quot;Barsaat&quot;.

In 1952, Nargis starred in the romance film &quot;Bewafa&quot;, which was not a major success. Following this, she also starred in the psychological drama &quot;Anhonee&quot; Nargis was highly appreciated for enacting a dual role and her performance garnered critical acclaim. Furthermore, rediff commented &quot;The ethereal actress is equally adept at bringing out the conflicting qualities of both -- the gregarious courtesan Mohini as well as her dignified half-sister and heiress, Roop&quot;. She then starred in the adventure film &quot;Amber&quot;. Out of her releases of 1952, only Anhonee was a success.&lt;red&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following this was the 1953 film Dhoon, which was not a major success. Her last film of the year was the romantic drama Aah, which too was not major success, despite this it is often regarded as a cult classic. Her only film of 1954 was &quot;Angarey&quot;.

=== 1955 - 1958: Resurgence and stardom ===
Nargis revived her career with Raj Kapoor&#x27;s social drama &quot;Shree 420&quot; (1955). In the film, Nargis portrays a school teacher who becomes Raj&#x27;s (played by Kapoor) love interest. It was Nargis&#x27; last under Raj Kapoor&#x27;s direction. Commenting on the performance, rediff said that &quot;The performances help the film&#x27;s endorsement of ethical living and high thinking. Nargis&#x27; quiet demeanour in the film contrasted with Raj Kapoor&#x27;s flamboyance&quot;. The film was a major blockbuster, emerging as the highest-grossing film in India at the time.

She once again collaborated with Kapoor for the box office success &quot;Chori Chori&quot; (1956), which revolves around a girl (Nargis) who runs away from her house in order to marry a gold digger pilot (Pran), but ends up falling for a news reporter (Kapoor) whom she meets in a bus. Described by ThePrint which praised the lead&#x27;s chemistry. The film was also a major box office success emerging as one of the highest-grossing films of the year. In the same year, she did a special appearance in Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Jagte Raho.&quot; The film was her last to co-star Raj Kapoor.

In 1957, she appeared in Mehboob Khan&#x27;s Oscar-nominated epic drama &quot;Mother India&quot;, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Baburao Patel of the film magazine, &quot;Filmindia&quot;, in December 1957, described &quot;Mother India&quot; as &quot;the greatest picture produced in India&quot; and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis. &quot;Mother India&quot; is generally regarded as Nargis&#x27;s best performance. Box Office India gave the film&#x27;s net collection as ₹40 million and its gross as ₹80 million, the highest for an Indian film up until &quot;Mughal-e-Azam&quot; (1960), while estimating that &quot;Mother India&quot;&#x27;s inflation-adjusted net would be equivalent to ₹1.173 billion in January 2008. Box Office India later estimated in 2017 that &quot;Mother India&quot; had over 100 million footfalls at the domestic box office, making it one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time when adjusted for inflation. Nargis won the Filmfare Best Actress Award in 1958 and became the first Indian to receive the Best Actress award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in present-day Czech Republic. Also in 1957, she acted in the &quot;Pardesi&quot; (marketed as &quot;Journey Beyond Three Seas&quot; in English), which was an Indo-Soviet co-production. After her marriage to Sunil Dutt in 1958, Nargis gave up her film career to settle down with her family, after her last few films were released. From 1951 to 1957, Box Office India ranked Nargis as the top actress.

=== 1960 - 1968: Final film appearances ===
She made her last film appearance in the psychological drama &quot;Raat Aur Din&quot; (1967), after being convinced to act for one last time after a long hiatus. The film was well received and Nargis&#x27; performance as a woman who has dissociative identity disorder was critically acclaimed. For her performance in the film, she received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, and won the inaugural National Film Award for Best Actress.

Nargis was also nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house of Indian Parliament) from 1980 to 1981, but due to cancer she fell ill and died during her tenure.

==Personal life==
Nargis had a long-time relationship with actor Raj Kapoor, who was her co-star in the films &quot;Awaara&quot; and &quot;Shree 420&quot;. Raj Kapoor was married and had children. After he refused to divorce his wife, Nargis ended their nine-year-long relationship.

Nargis married actor Sunil Dutt; who was a Hindu, also of Punjabi Mohyal descent, on 11 March 1958. Prior to their marriage, Nargis converted to Hinduism and adopted the name Nirmala Dutt. Reportedly, Dutt had saved her life from a fire on the sets of &quot;Mother India&quot;. She had also reportedly helped Dutt&#x27;s sister and mother. They had three children: Sanjay Dutt, Namrata Dutt, and Priya Dutt. Sanjay went on to become a successful film actor. Namrata married actor Kumar Gaurav, son of veteran actor Rajendra Kumar who had appeared alongside Nargis and Sunil Dutt in &quot;Mother India&quot;. Priya became a politician and a Member of Parliament (Lok Sabha).

With her husband, Nargis formed the Ajanta Arts Cultural Troupe, which involved several leading actors and singers of the time, and performed at remote frontiers to entertain the Indian soldiers at border. It was the first troupe to perform in Dhaka, after the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971. Later, Nargis worked for the cause of spastic children. She became the first patron of the Spastics Society of India. Her charitable work for the organisation got her recognition as a social worker.

Nargis loved wearing white saris, speaking over the telephone and eating panipuris sold on the streets. She was an excellent swimmer and enjoyed playing cricket with her brothers. The founder of the Spastic Society of India, Mithu Alur, stated in an interview that Nargis had a dream of pursuing medicine that she could never fulfill.

==Illness and death==
On 2 August 1980, Nargis fell ill during a session of the Rajya Sabha, with the initial cause assumed to be jaundice. She was rushed home and admitted to Breach Candy Hospital in Bombay. After 15 days of tests, during which her condition kept worsening and she rapidly lost weight, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1980 and underwent treatment for the disease at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Upon her return to India, her condition deteriorated and she was admitted at Breach Candy Hospital. Nargis went into a coma on 2 May 1981 after she became seriously ill and died the next day, aged 51. Because she feared fire, she wanted to be buried in accordance with the Muslim customs. Her body was carried on a bier according to Hindu customs. Sunil and Sanjay offered Namaz along with other mourners. She was buried at Bada Qabrastan Mumbai. On 7 May 1981, at the premiere of her son&#x27;s debut film &quot;Rocky&quot;, one seat was kept vacant for her.

One year after her death, the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation was established by Sunil Dutt in her memory. Although Nargis&#x27; death is attributed to pancreatic cancer, her daughter, Namrata Dutt Kumar, claimed her mother had successfully fought the cancer but died from a urinary tract infection. Nargis&#x27;s son, Sanjay Dutt, added that her lowered immunity levels made her susceptible to the infection.

<text>Mail Boxes Etc. (MBE) is an American-Italian third-party provider of shipping, fulfilment, printing, and marketing services through a network of franchised locations. MBE is an Italian family-owned holding company headquartered in Milan, Italy. It ranks among the world&#x27;s largest networks of service centres, offering shipping, logistics, printing, marketing, and design services to both businesses and private customers.

== History ==

Mail Boxes Etc. was founded in the United States in 1980 by Gerald Aul, Pat Senn, and Robert Diais. By the year 2000, MBE had expanded to include 4,000 locations worldwide, including South Korea and Sweden.

MBE operates a network of retail centres providing packing and shipping services, logistics support, communications, and marketing services to both business and private customers. The majority of the centres are owned by franchisees, both individual and master franchisees.

=== Acquisition by UPS ===
In 2001, United Parcel Service (UPS) acquired Mail Boxes Etc., Inc. locations in the United States and Canada. On April 7, 2003, UPS began converting the 3,000 Mail Boxes Etc. locations in the United States and Canada (at the time, nearly 90% of the domestic U.S. network) to The UPS Store and started offering lower UPS direct shipping rates, with an average reduction of around 20%.

These centres remain locally owned and operated, continuing to offer a wide range of services, including packing, shipping, freight, postal services, printing, and business services.

=== MBE Worldwide Group ===
In 2009, MBE Worldwide was established to acquire the existing Mail Boxes Etc. network from UPS worldwide, excluding the United States and Canada. MBE Worldwide subsequently expanded across Western Europe, establishing a direct presence in France in 2012, Poland in 2014, and the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland in 2021.

As of 31 December 2016, MBE Worldwide had nearly 1,600 locations in 30 countries, with total sales of €427 million in 2016.

==== Acquisitions ====
In 2017, MBE Worldwide acquired two U.S. companies, PostNet International Franchise and AlphaGraphics Inc. With these acquisitions, the MBE network expanded to approximately 2,500 service centres, including 500 in the US and 2,000 in 43 countries worldwide. In 2021, MBE Worldwide also acquired Pack &amp; Send, a leading brand in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom in the Shipping and Logistics service industry, as well as MultiCopy, a leading brand in the Netherlands that provides Print and Marketing Solutions including signs, printing, and websites. In addition, Prestashop joined the MBE Worldwide group in November 2021, furthering MBE Worldwide&#x27;s transition into a fully integrated digital and physical commerce platform for business growth. In 2022, MBE Worldwide purchased a majority stake in the United Kingdom company World Options Ltd. and an Italian tech platform dedicated to proximity logistics, GEL Proximity.

In November 2024, the parent company of Mail Boxes Etc., MBE Worldwide, announced a rebranding and is now known as Fortidia.

<doc id="684964" wikidata="Q2900103" url="?curid=684964" title="Bethsabée de Rothschild">
<text>Baroness Bethsabée de Rothschild (assumed the name Batsheva after she immigrated to Israel in 1951; 23 September 1914 – 20 April 1999) was a philanthropist, dance patron, and member of the Rothschild banking family.

==Early life and education==
Bethsabée de Rothschild was a great-granddaughter of James Mayer Rothschild (1792–1868) and the fourth and youngest child of Baron Édouard Alphonse de Rothschild (1868–1949) and his wife, the former Germaine Alice Halphen (1884–1975). Her father ran the French bank with his cousin Baron Robert Philippe de Rothschild (1880–1946). Bethsabée grew up at Château de Ferrières outside of Paris, and at the Talleyrand palace, in Paris itself. Her elder brother, Édouard Alphonse Émile Lionel (1906–1911), died at the age of four of appendicitis; she also had a brother, Guy and a sister, Jacqueline. She was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris and received her bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology. Following the invasion of France in 1940, she fled with her family to New York City, where she studied biochemistry and biology at Columbia University, but never received an advanced degree.

Though born to a wealthy and influential family, Bethsabée was said to have detested the rich lifestyle and distanced herself from her family, with the exception of her sister Jacqueline, with whom Bethsabée appeared to have been close and her brother Guy. She was said to have been a modest and generous woman.

===World War II===
During World War II, she enlisted in the Free French forces and was part of the landing force for the Battle of Normandy. She moved with the army to liberate Paris, where she served as a liaison between the French and United States military forces. At war&#x27;s end, she returned to New York and enrolled at the Martha Graham dance school.

==Dance companies==
In 1951, not long after her divorce from Bloomingdale, Rothschild traveled to Israel for the first time, settling there permanently in 1962. In Israel Rothschild made significant contributions to dance through the establishment of the Batsheva Dance Company that became one of the most influential cultural role models in Israel. In the mid-1960s, she met the South African-born classical dancer, Jeannette Ordman, who had come to Israel in 1965 from London, England; the two women were professional partners until Rothschild&#x27;s death. With Rothschild&#x27;s financial backing, they formed a dance school and a few years later the Bat-Dor Dance Company, with Ordman as the company&#x27;s artistic director.

In addition to her cultural activities, Bethsabée de Rothschild created two foundations to advance science and technology in Israel in connection with which she was awarded the Israel Prize in 1989, for special contribution to society and to the State of Israel.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Bethsabée de Rothschild married Donald Bloomingdale (1913–1954), the son of Irving Bloomingdale and the grandson of Lyman G. Bloomingdale, co-founder of the Bloomingdale department store. At the time of their wedding, Bloomingdale was the attache of the Paris Embassy to the United States under Jefferson Caffery. The marriage was short-lived. It is purported that she had a child that died, though seemingly not from her marriage with Bloomingdale. Her brother Guy reports this event in his memoirs, but fails to list any vital information about the child. This birth and untimely death appears to be the only such listing in the Rothschild family tree for which no identifying information is given.

Rothschild died at her home in Tel Aviv in 1999 after a lengthy illness and was buried in Israel.

===Art collection===
Through a trust, she had inherited part of a major art collection assembled by her grandfather Baron Alphonse James de Rothschild. This included a 17th-century oil painting by Rembrandt and other Old Master paintings as well as Islamic and Venetian glass, decorative objects and porcelain, and Renaissance-style jewelry. Following her death, the collections were auctioned off. Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; was sold by Christie&#x27;s in London to the Dutch art dealer Robert Noortman for a record price of US$28.7 million.

<doc id="684968" wikidata="Q6305202" url="?curid=684968" title="Juicing">
<text>Juicing is the process of extracting juice from plant tissues such as fruit or vegetables.

== Overview ==

There are many methods of juicing, from squeezing fruit by hand to wide-scale extraction with industrial equipment. Juicing is generally the preferred method of consuming large amounts of produce quickly and is often completed with a household appliance called a juicer, which may be as simple as a cone upon which fruit is mashed or as sophisticated as a variable-speed, motor-driven device. It may also refer to the act of extracting and then drinking juice or those who extract the juice.

Juicing is different from buying juice in the supermarket because it focuses on fresh pressed fruits and vegetables. Residential juicing is often practiced for dietary reasons or as a form of alternative medicine. Becoming first popular in the early 1970s, interest in juicing has since increased. Films such as &quot;Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead&quot;, &quot;Food Matters&quot;, and &quot;Hungry for Change&quot; have increased the sales of juicers.

In America, juicing was popularized by Gayelord Hauser, Jay Kordich and Norman W. Walker.

== Methods ==
Juicing tools have been used throughout history. Manual devices include barrel-shaped presses, hand-operated grinders, and inverted cones upon which fruit is mashed and twisted. Modern juicers are powered by electric motors generating from 200 to 1000 or more watts. There are several types of electric juicers: masticating, centrifugal, and triturating juicers. These variations are defined by the means of extracting the juice.
* Masticating (also referred to as cold pressed) – utilizes a single gear driven by a motor; slower operation; kneads and grinds items placed in a chute
* Centrifugal – (also referred to as high-speed juicing) – utilizes a spinning blade that resembles a grated basket; faster operation; quickly grinds items and discards pulp in a receptacle
*Triturating – utilizes twin gears; slower operation; often has multiple uses

== Health effects ==

The American Journal of Public Health proposed that the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 in the United States eliminate 100% fruit juices since it has been linked to childhood obesity, and substitute instead with whole fruits.

Juicing removes the fiber content of the fruit or vegetable, and the full benefits of the plant is thus not experienced. Re-adding fiber to the juice cannot be equated to whole fruits. There is a loss in non-extracted polyphenols, a class of phytonutrients, in fruit juice compared to whole plant foods. Most polyphenols are bound to the plant fibers, and constitute the major portion of dietary polyphenols. There is therefore a marked loss of phytonutrients in consuming fruits and vegetables through the juicing process alone.

The American Cancer Society says, &quot;there is no convincing scientific evidence that extracted juices are healthier than whole foods&quot;.

Juicing may not be the best way to extract all of the nutritional value from fruits and vegetables. One study has shown that when juiced grapefruit was compared with blended, the latter was superior. Smoothies, which are the blending of fruit into juice, not the extraction, leave pulp and seeds within the drink leading to better nutrition.

<text>Tertiary government usually refers to the local or lowest organizational level of government within three-layered federal systems. Typical federal systems include: 
#the &quot;principal&quot; national government;
#the &quot;secondary&quot; provinces, states or departments; and,
#the &quot;tertiary&quot; municipalities, counties or townships.

This generalization glosses over &quot;microregional&quot; organizations of greater cities and associations of counties or municipalities. It also does not take into account intergovernmental or supranational levels of governance, such as the European Union, the United Nations, or the World Trade Organization for example.

Hospitals may sometimes be categorised as tertiary level. Tertiary government hospitals exist in the Philippines.

<doc id="684976" wikidata="Q16472452" url="?curid=684976" title="Jumpsuit">
<text>A jumpsuit is a one-piece garment with sleeves and legs and typically without integral coverings for feet, hands or head. The original jump suit is the functional one-piece garment used by parachutists. 

The original skydivers&#x27; jumpsuits were simple garments designed to insulate the body from the colder temperatures associated with higher altitudes and minimize the risk of covering important handles and grips. Today, however, the garment has found other uses.

Jumpsuits are generally regarded as a garment of convenience as they are simpler, lighter and more flexible to wear. They have become more of a &quot;put-on-and-remove&quot; garment than an ensemble outfit. However, unless the jumpsuit has an opening on the rear (a &quot;drop seat&quot;), it is necessary to remove it entirely for bathroom use.

==History of the jumpsuit==
A jumpsuit is a one-piece dress which fits slim and covers the arms and legs. Its history goes back to 1919. It was created as a functional garment for parachutists to jump from planes. The boiler suit and dungarees were also used for a similar purpose.
Amongst the three utility wear garments (jumpsuits, boiler suits and dungarees) jumpsuits were the first one to become fashion wear. The reason was its slimmer cut.

In the 1930s, fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli began designing jumpsuits for women. Her designs were the talk of the town but were worn by only a few. 
Then came the sporty styles by the American designer Vera Maxwell in the mid-1940s. It was popular but was a novelty item. 

During the Second World War, jumpsuits were worn by women for their usefulness. 
In the 1950s, American designers like Bonnie Cashin started designing evening jumpsuits. But it was another decade before jumpsuits became popular as day and evening wear. The jumpsuit first appeared in Vogue in September 1964. Guy Laroche wore a brown jersey jumpsuit paired with a sealskin jacket and it was photographed by Irving Penn. It became a popular trend within a few months and two “moon shot”-style jumpsuits in white jerseys featured as Vogue patterns in January 1965.

The late 1960s and 1970s were very important years for the jumpsuit. They were made as sportswear, in leather one-pieces, and also as embellished designs for evening. Jumpsuits found a place in every designer&#x27;s designs. In the 1970s jumpsuit was a unisex outfit. Cher and Elvis wore stylish jumpsuits during their stage performances. Famous American designer Geoffrey Beene called the jumpsuit “the ballgown of the next century”, but it became out of fashion for the next decade. Nicolas Ghesquière tried to bring it back in 2002 by designing it in different fabrics and patterns. The updated jumpsuit again gained popularity, and thus the style was relaunched.

==Pilots and drivers==
Aviators and astronauts sometimes wear insulated, fire-retardant jumpsuits or flight suits where other types of clothing can potentially float or flap about in zero gravity or during high-G maneuvers.

Drivers in motor racing wear jumpsuits for protection against fire (called a fire suit) and (in the case of motorcycle racers) leather suits for abrasion.

==Prisoners==

Short-sleeved jumpsuits are common as a prison uniform, particularly in the United States. The clothing is a convenient way to determine who is an inmate and who is a corrections officer. Although bright orange uniforms are still in use, some institutions changed for other colors as orange jumpsuits became fashionable due to the influence of the Netflix series &quot;Orange is the New Black.&quot; Furthermore, color-coded uniforms are fairly commonly used where different colors signify the inmate&#x27;s custody level or issues like gender, potential safety risks, disciplinary history, severity of current charges and past convictions. Some institutions even went back to striped uniforms to prevent escaped inmates from being mistaken for sanitation, utility or highway workers.

<text>The Frauen-Bundesliga (German for &quot;Women&#x27;s Federal League&quot;), currently known as the [[Google Pixel]] Frauen-Bundesliga for sponsorship reasons, is the top level of league competition for women&#x27;s association football in Germany.

In the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League, the Frauen-Bundesliga is the most successful league with a total of nine titles from four clubs.

In 1990 the German Football Association (DFB) created the German Women&#x27;s Bundesliga, based on the model of the men&#x27;s Bundesliga. It was first played with north and south divisions, but in 1997 the groups were merged to form a uniform league. The league currently consists of twelve teams and the seasons usually last from late summer to the end of spring with a break in the winter. Despite the league&#x27;s competitiveness, it has been semi-professional. VfL Wolfsburg has won the most championships. Although the league has become more professional, women&#x27;s-only teams have found it difficult to support themselves without corporate financial backing.

==Competition format==
The Bundesliga consists of twelve teams. At the end of a season, the club in the top spot is the champion, gaining the title of &quot;Deutscher Meister&quot;, and the clubs finishing 11th and 12th are replaced with the respective top-placed teams of the two 2. Frauen-Bundesliga divisions. A Bundesliga season consists of two rounds, with 22 games combined. In a round every club plays against each other, having a home game against a specific club in one round and an away game in the other. The seasons typically start in August or September, with the first round finishing in December. The second round typically starts in February and ends in May or June, though sometimes the first games of the second round are held in December. In World Cup years, the league might alter its schedule to accommodate the tournament.

The Bundesliga ranking is determined by points a club has gained during a season. A win is worth 3 points, a draw 1, and a loss 0. The tiebreakers are in descending order goal difference, goals for, and head-to-head results. If the tie in the league table cannot be broken, a tie-breaking game is held.

In June 2024, the DFB announced that from the 2025–26 season on, it will be played with 14 teams.

<doc id="684986" wikidata="Q878084" url="?curid=684986" title="Wu wei">
<text>Wu wei () is a polysemous, ancient Chinese concept expressing an ideal practice of &quot;inaction&quot;, &quot;inexertion&quot; or &quot;effortless action&quot;, as a state of personal harmony and free-flowing, spontaneous creative manifestation. Connected with the idea of the Heart or Spirit (Shen 神) in Traditional Chinese medicine, it often relates to the behavior of the emperor, most commonly referring to an ideal form of governance or government. 

&quot;Wu wei&quot; appears as early as the Spring and Autumn period, with early literary examples in the Classic of Poetry. It became an important concept in the Confucian Analects, linking a Confucian ethic of practical morality to a state of being harmonizing intention and action. It would go on to become a central concept in &quot;Legalist&quot; statecraft and Daoism, in Daoism as a concept emphasizing alignment with the natural Dao in actions and intentions, avoiding force or haste against the natural order.

Sinologist Jean François Billeter describes wu-wei as a &quot;state of perfect knowledge (understanding) of the coexistence of the situation and perceiver, perfect efficaciousness and the realization of a perfect economy of energy&quot;.

==Early scholarship==
The early scholarship of Feng Youlan suggested a distinction between philosophical and religious Daoism. Following him, sinologist Herrlee G. Creel took a &quot;contemplative Daoism&quot; as coming first, and &quot;purposive Daoism&quot; second. Creel took &quot;wu wei&quot; as found in the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; and &quot;Daodejing&quot; as denoting two different things:

# An &quot;attitude of genuine non-action, motivated by a lack of desire to participate in human affairs&quot; and
# A &quot;technique by means of which the one who practices it may gain enhanced control of human affairs&quot;.

The first aligns closely with the contemplative Daoism of the Zhuangzi. Daoist texts rarely suggest that wu wei could help ordinary people gain political power, portraying it as a source of serenity. Creel takes the Zhuangzi&#x27;s idea of Wu wei as rooted in its transcendental idea of the dao, viewing such things as life and death as an &quot;indissoluble unity.&quot; Creel did not see the &quot;Zhuangzi&#x27;s&quot; view of wu wei as a definitive philosophical idea so much as that the sage avoids worldly affairs. Whether seeking gain or fame, the Zhuangzi regards the &quot;small&quot; and &quot;superior&quot; men largely the same, inasmuch as they abandon the &quot;normal feelings of men&quot; and &quot;proper human course&quot; in favor of &quot;strange and unnatural endeavors&quot;.

Creel suggested that Daoists might have adopted the second idea of wu wei from Shen Buhai (400 BCE – ) as they became interested in rulers&#x27; use of power. Regardless, Shen Buhai and the Han Feizi are a major influence for the Huainanzi&#x27;s idea of wu wei in the Han dynasty.

Called &quot;rule by non-activity&quot; and strongly advocated by the Han Feizi, during the Han dynasty until the reign of Han Wudi, rulers confined their activity &quot;chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials&quot;. This &quot;conception of the ruler&#x27;s role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp&quot; while leaving details to ministers, has a &quot;deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy&quot;, playing a &quot;crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity&quot;, ensuring the ruler&#x27;s power and the stability of the polity.

Although the Inner Zhuangzi may precede them, much of the Outer Zhuangzi derives more from at least the later part of the Warring States period, ridiculing Confucian moralization. Still only appearing three times in the second half of the Zhuangzi, Creel supposed that early Daoists may have avoided the term for its association with Legalism before ultimately co-opting its governmental sense as well, regarding this as attempted in the Outer &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;″s chapter. In the more &quot;purposive&quot; Daoism of the &quot;Daodejing,&quot; likely written after the early &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;wu wei&quot; becomes a major &quot;guiding principle for social and political pursuit&quot;, in which the Daoist &quot;seeks to use his power to control and govern the world&quot;.

== Confucian development ==
Sinologist Roger T. Ames regards attempts to determine the origin of &quot;wu wei&quot; as strained speculation. Shen Buhai bares a &quot;striking&quot; resemblance to the Tao te Ching. But it would still be difficult to date the Tao te Ching back to the time of Confucius, even if it predated the third century bce. Apart from Shen Buhai, the Analects of Confucius (Lun-yu) are the only preserved text prior to the Zhuangzi that use the term. More recently, Edward Slingerland believes the &quot;idea&quot; of wu wei predated the term. With older sinologists more focused on terms, Creel believed that an important clue to the idea of &quot;wu wei&quot; existed in the Analects.

A saying attributed to Confucius reads: &quot;The Master said, &#x27;Was it not Shun who did nothing and yet ruled well? What did he do? He merely corrected his person (&quot;made himself reverent&quot; – Slingerland) and took his proper position (facing south) as ruler&#x27;&quot;. The concept of a divine king whose &quot;magic power&quot; (virtue) &quot;regulates everything in the land&quot; (Creel) pervades early Chinese philosophy, particularly &quot;in the early branches of Quietism that developed in the fourth century B.C.&quot;

Slingerland argues &quot;wu wei&quot; in this sense has to be attained. But in the Confucian conception of virtue, virtue can only be attained by not consciously trying to attain it. The manifestation of virtue is regarded as a reward by Heaven for following its will – as a power that enables them to establish this will on earth. In this, probably more original sense, &quot;wu wei&quot; may be regarded as the &quot;skill&quot; of &quot;becoming a fully realized human being&quot;, a sense which it shares with Daoism. This &quot;skill&quot; avoids relativity through being linked to a &quot;normative&quot; metaphysical order, making its spontaneity &quot;objective&quot;. By achieving a state of &quot;wu wei&quot; (and taking his proper ritual place), Shun &quot;unifies and orders&quot; the entire world, and finds his place in the &quot;cosmos&quot;. Taken as a historical fact demonstrating the viable superiority of Confucianism (or Daoism, for Daoist depictions), &quot;wu wei&quot; may be understood as a strongly &quot;realist&quot; spiritual-religious ideal, differing from Kantian or Cartesian realism in its Chinese emphasis on practice.

The &quot;object&quot; of &quot;wu wei&quot; &quot;skill-knowledge&quot; is the Way, which is – to an extent regardless of school – &quot;embodying&quot; the mind to a &quot;normative order existing independently of the minds of the practitioners&quot;. The primary example of Confucianism – Confucius at age 7 – displays &quot;mastery of morality&quot; spontaneously, his inclinations being in harmony with his virtue. Confucius considers training unnecessary if one is born loving the Way, as with the disciple Yan Hui. Mencius believed that men are already good, and need only realize it not by trying, but by allowing virtue to realize itself, and coming to love the Way. Training is done to learn to spontaneously love the Way. Virtue is compared with the grain seed (being domesticated) and the flow of water. On the other hand, Xun Kuang considered it possible to attain &quot;wu wei&quot; only through a long and intensive traditional training.

== Daoist development ==

Following its developments elsewhere, Zhuang Zhou and Laozi turn towards an unadorned &quot;no effort&quot;. Laozi, as opposed to carved Confucian jade, advocates a return to the primordial Mother and to become like uncarved wood. He condemns doing and grasping, urging the reader to cognitively grasp oneness (still the mind), reduce desires and the size of the state, leaving human nature untouched. In practice, &quot;wu wei&quot; is aimed at through behaviour modification; cryptically referenced meditation and more purely physical breathing techniques as in the &quot;Guanzi&quot;, which includes just taking the right posture. While the &quot;Guanzi&quot; itself may have been compiled even after the Han Feizi, they may be of much earlier origin.

Though, by still needing to make a cognitive effort, perhaps not resolving the paradox of not doing, the concentration on accomplishing &quot;wu wei&quot; through the physiological would influence later thinkers. The &quot;Daodejing&quot; became influential in intellectual circles around 250 BCE (1999: 26–27). Included in the 2nd century Guanzi, the likely older &quot;Neiye&quot; (or &quot;Inward Training&quot;) may be the oldest recovered Chinese text, describing what would become Daoist breath meditation techniques and qi circulation, with Harold D. Roth considering it to be a genuine 4th-century BCE text.

Verse 13 describes the aspects of , attained through relaxed efforts.

==&quot;Wuwei&quot; in Chan Buddhism==
&quot;Wuwei&quot; occurs in Chinese Buddhist scholastic contexts, where it is a translation of the Sanskrit term &quot;asaṃskṛta&quot;, or &quot;unconditioned.&quot; However, in Chan sources it retains its native Chinese sense of &quot;nonaction&quot; and &quot;without intent.&quot; Perhaps the earliest occurence of the term in Chan can be found in the &quot;Two Entrances and Four Practices&quot; of Bodhidharma, which appears among the earliest of Chan records found in the &quot;Long Scroll&quot; (dubbed the &quot;Bodhidharma Anthology&quot; by Jeffrey Broughton). There Bodhidharma says, &quot;Principle is the obverse of the conventional; quiet mind and practice no-action; forms follow the turnings of fate; the ten thousand existences are thus void; wish for nothing.&quot; 

Henrik Sorensen observes that &quot;wuwei&quot; and other terms commonly associated with Daoism appear in the two Oxhead School texts, the &quot;Jueguan lun&quot; (Treatise on Cutting Off Contemplation) and the &quot;Xin Ming&quot; (Mind Inscription). For example, the &quot;Xin Ming&quot; says:Enjoying the Dao is calmingWandering at ease in the truly realNothing to do (無為, &quot;wuwei&quot;), nothing to attainRelying on nothing, appearing naturally
&quot;Wuwei&quot; also occurs several times in another text associated with the Oxhead School known as the &quot;Baozang lun&quot; (Treasure Store Treatise), where it appears alongside the East Asian philosophical concept of &quot;ganying&quot;, or &quot;sympathetic resonance.&quot; In a Buddhist context, this relates to the idea of &quot;ying-shen,&quot; the resonant or response body of a Buddha. It is the ability of the Buddhist sage to respond to external stimuli and the needs of suffering beings spontaneously and &quot;without any premeditation or will of his own.&quot; According to Sharf, this combines the early Chinese ideal of the sage-king with Indian Buddhist notions of Bodhi as free of karmic activity. The &quot;Baozang lun&quot; says: &quot;Some call it holy, some call it brilliant; there are many ways to refer to it, as each employs its own name. But in reality its essential principle is nonaction, and its appearance is the absence of attributes.&quot;

&quot;Wuwei&quot; also appears in verses attributed to the Liang dynasty figure Baozhi. For example: &quot;The uncontrived (&quot;wuwei&quot;) Great Way is natural and spontaneous; you don&#x27;t need to use your mind to figure it out.&quot; It also appears in the famous &quot;Zhengdao ge&quot; (Song of Attaining the Way), attributed to Huineng&#x27;s disciple Yongjia Xuanjue: &quot;A man of the Way, awakening left behind, selfless, at ease (&quot;wuwei&quot;), Does not eliminate foolish thoughts, nor seeks the real.&quot; According to Jinhua Jia, although the above have been attributed to Baozhi of the Liang and Yongjia Xuanjue respectively, these are likely products of the Hongzhou school of Chan, which flourished during the Tang dynasty.

In other Chan sources one can also find the similar term, &quot;wú shì&quot; (無事), often translated as &quot;nothing-to-do,&quot; but which also has the meaning of no affairs, no concerns, no matters, and no business. For instance, Huangbo Xiyun states, &quot;the person of the Way is the one who has nothing to do [&quot;wú shì&quot;], who has no mind at all and no doctrine to preach. Having nothing to do, such a person lives at ease.&quot; Likewise, Huangbo&#x27;s student Linji Yixuan says, &quot;Followers of the Way, as to buddhadharma, no effort is necessary. You have only to be ordinary, with nothing to do—defecating, urinating, wearing clothes, eating food, and lying down when tired.&quot;

==In political theory==

Unable to find his philosopher-king, Confucius placed his hope in virtuous ministers. Apart from the Confucian ruler&#x27;s &quot;divine essence&quot; (&quot;ling&quot;) &quot;ensuring the fecundity of his people&quot; and fertility of the soil, Creel notes that he was also assisted by &quot;five servants&quot;, who &quot;performed the active functions of government&quot;. Xun Kuang&#x27;s &quot;Xunzi&quot;, a Confucian adaptation to Qin Legalism, defines the ruler in much the same sense, saying that the ruler &quot;need only correct his person&quot; because the &quot;abilities of the ruler appear in his appointment of men to office&quot;: namely, appraising virtue and causing others to perform.

Important information lay in the recovery of the fragments of administrator Shen Buhai. Shen portrays Yao as using Fa (administrative method) in the selection and evaluation of men. Though not a conclusive argument against proto-Daoist influence, Shen&#x27;s Daoist terms do not show evidence of Daoist usage (Confucianism also uses terms like &#x27;Dao&#x27;, meaning the &#x27;Way&#x27; of government), lacking any metaphysical connotation. The later Legalist book, the &quot;Han Feizi&quot; has a commentary on the &quot;Daodejing&quot;, but references Shen Buhai rather than Laozi for this usage.

Shen is credited with the dictum &quot;The Sage ruler relies on method and does not rely on wisdom; he relies on technique, not on persuasions&quot;, and used the term &quot;wu wei&quot; to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers, saying &quot;One who has the right way of government does not perform the functions of the five (aka various) officials, and yet is the master of the government&quot;.

Since the bulk of both the &quot;Daodejing&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; appear to have been composed at a later point, Creel argued that it may therefore be assumed that Shen influenced them, much of both appearing to be counter-arguments against Legalist controls. The &quot;Way of Heaven&quot; chapter of the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; seems to follow Shen Buhai down to the detail, saying &quot;Superiors must be without action in-order to control the world; inferiors must be active in-order to be employed in the world&#x27;s business...&quot; and to paraphrase, that foundation and principle are the responsibility of the superior, superstructure and details that of the minister, but then goes on to attack Shen&#x27;s administrative details as non-essential.

Elsewhere, the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; references another Legalist, Shen Dao, as impartial and lacking selfishness, his &quot;great way embracing all things&quot;.

=== Non-action by the ruler ===

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler needs to do little – and must do little. Apparently paraphrasing the Analects, Shen did not consider the relationship between ruler and minister antagonistic necessarily, but still believed that the ruler&#x27;s most able ministers were his greatest danger, and was convinced that it was impossible to make them loyal without techniques. Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel explains: &quot;The ruler&#x27;s subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous – and therefore vulnerable – by taking any overt action.&quot;

Emphasizing the use of administrative methods (&quot;Fa&quot;) in secrecy, Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his weaknesses and dependence on his advisers. Shen therefore advises the ruler to keep his own counsel, hide his motivations, and conceal his tracks in inaction, availing himself of an appearance of stupidity and insufficiency. Shen says:

Acting through &quot;Fa&quot;, the ruler conceals his intentions, likes and dislikes, skills and opinions. Not acting himself, he can avoid being manipulated. The ruler plays no active role in governmental functions. He should not use his talent even if he has it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries. Creel argues that not getting involved in details allowed Shen&#x27;s ruler to &quot;truly rule&quot;, because it leaves him free to supervise the government without interfering, maintaining his perspective. Seeing and hearing independently, the ruler is able to make decisions independently, and is, Shen says, able to rule the world thereby.

This &quot;wu wei&quot; might be said to end up the political theory of the &quot;Legalists&quot;, if not becoming their general term for political strategy, playing a &quot;crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity&quot;. The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity.

=== Non-action in statecraft ===
Shen Buhai insisted that the ruler must be fully informed of the state of his realm, but couldn&#x27;t afford to get caught up in details and in an ideal situation need listen to no one. Listening to his courtiers might interfere with promotions, and he does not, as Sinologist Herrlee G. Creel says, have the time to do so. The way to see and hear independently is the grouping together of particulars into categories using mechanical or operational method (Fa). On the contrary the ruler&#x27;s eyes and ears will make him &quot;deaf and blind&quot; (unable to obtain accurate information). Seeing and hearing independently, the ruler is able to make decisions independently, and is, Shen says, able to rule the world thereby.

Despite this, Shen&#x27;s method of appointment, &quot;Ming-shih&quot;, advises a particular method for listening to petitioners in the final analyses, which would be articulated as Xing-Ming by Han Fei. In the Han dynasty secretaries of government who had charge of the records of decisions in criminal matters were called Xing-Ming, which Sima Qian (145 or 135 – 86 BC) and Liu Xiang (77–6 BC) attributed to the doctrine of Shen Buhai (400 – ). Liu Xiang goes as far as to define Shen Buhai&#x27;s doctrine as Xing-Ming. Rather than having to look for &quot;good&quot; men, ming-shih or xing-ming can seek the right man for a particular post by comparing his reputation with real conduct (xing &quot;form&quot; or shih &quot;reality&quot;), though doing so implies a total organizational knowledge of the regime.

More simply though, one can allow ministers to &quot;name&quot; themselves through accounts of specific cost and time frame, leaving their definition to competing ministers. Claims or utterances &quot;bind the speaker to the realization a job&quot; (Makeham). This was the doctrine, with subtle differences, favoured by Han Fei. Favoring exactness, it combats the tendency to promise too much. The correct articulation of is considered crucial to the realization of projects.

Shen resolved hair-splitting litigation through &quot;wu wei&quot;, or not getting involved, making an official&#x27;s words his own responsibility. Shen Buhai says, &quot;The ruler controls the policy, the ministers manage affairs. To speak ten times and ten times be right, to act a hundred times and a hundred times succeed – this is the business of one who serves another as minister; it is not the way to rule.&quot; The correlation between &quot;wu wei&quot; and ming-shih likely informed the Taoist conception of the formless Tao that &quot;gives rise to the ten thousand things.&quot;

====Yin (passive mindfulness)====
Adherence to the use of technique in governing requires the ruler not engage in any interference or subjective consideration. Sinologist John Makeham explains: &quot;assessing words and deeds requires the ruler&#x27;s dispassionate attention; (yin is) the skill or technique of making one&#x27;s mind a tabula rasa, non-committaly taking note of all the details of a man&#x27;s claims and then objectively comparing his achievements of the original claims.&quot;

A commentary to the Shiji cites a now-lost book as quoting Shen Buhai saying: &quot;By employing (yin), &#x27;passive mindfulness&#x27;, in overseeing and keeping account of his vassals, accountability is deeply engraved.&quot; The &quot;Guanzi&quot; similarly says: &quot;Yin is the way of non-action. Yin is neither to add to nor to detract from anything. To give something a name strictly on the basis of its form – this is the Method of yin.&quot; Yin also aimed at concealing the ruler&#x27;s intentions, likes and opinions.

=== Shen Dao ===
Shen Dao espouses an impersonal administration in much the same sense as Shen Buhai, and argued for &quot;wu wei&quot;, or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines, saying
Shen Dao eschews appointment by interview in favour of a mechanical distribution apportioning every person according to their achievement. Linking administrative methods or standards to the notion of impartial objectivity associated with universal interest, and reframing the language of the old ritual order to fit a universal, imperial and highly bureaucratized state, Shen cautions the ruler against relying on his own personal judgment, contrasting personal opinions with the merit of the objective standard as preventing personal judgements or opinions from being exercised. Personal opinions destroy standards, and Shen Dao&#x27;s ruler therefore &quot;does not show favoritism toward a single person&quot;.

===Han Fei===
Devoting the entirety of Chapter 14, &quot;How to Love the Ministers&quot;, to &quot;persuading the ruler to be ruthless to his ministers&quot;, Han Fei&#x27;s enlightened ruler strikes terror into his ministers by doing nothing (wu wei). The qualities of a ruler, his &quot;mental power, moral excellence and physical prowess&quot; are irrelevant. He discards his private reason and morality, and shows no personal feelings. What is important is his method of government. Fa (administrative standards) require no perfection on the part of the ruler.

If the Han Fei&#x27;s use of &quot;wu wei&quot; was derivative of proto-Daoist folk religion, its Dao nonetheless emphasizes autocracy (&quot;Tao does not identify with anything but it non-self, the ruler does not identify with the ministers&quot;). Accepting that Han Fei applies &quot;wu wei&quot; specifically to statecraft, professors Xing Lu argues that Han Fei still considered &quot;wu wei&quot; is still a virtue. As Han Fei says, &quot;by virtue (De) of resting empty and reposed, he waits for the course of nature to force or unfold itself.&quot;

The &quot;Han Feizi&quot;″s commentary on the Daodejing asserts that perspectiveless knowledge – an absolute point of view – is possible.

=== Han dynasty ===
Legalism dominated the intellectual life of the Qin and early Han together with Daoism. Early Han dynasty Emperors like Emperor Jing (r. 157–141 BCE) would be steeped in a Daoistic laissez-faire. But Shen Buhai&#x27;s book would be widely studied even from the beginning of the Han era. Jia Yi&#x27;s (200–168 AD) Hsin-shu, undoubtedly influenced by the &quot;Legalists&quot;, describes Shen Buhai&#x27;s techniques as methods of applying the Dao, or virtue, bringing together Confucian and Daoist discourses under the imagery of the Zhuangzi. Many later texts, for instance in Huang-Lao, use similar images to describe the quiescent attitude of the ruler.

The Huang-Lao text &quot;Huainanzi&quot; (Western Han dynasty 206 B.C. – 9 A.D.), although oriented toward state interest, would go on to include naturalist arguments in favour of rule by worthies on the basis that one needs their competence for such things as diplomacy, and defines &quot;wu wei&quot; as follows:

The Huang–Lao text Jing fa says:

Philosopher Alan Watts believed that &quot;wu wei&quot; can be described as &quot;not-forcing.&quot; Watts also understood &quot;wu wei&quot; as “the art of getting out of one’s own way” and offered the following illustration: “The river is not pushed from behind, nor is it pulled from ahead. It falls with gravity.”

Leo Tolstoy was deeply influenced by Daoist philosophy, and wrote his own interpretation of &quot;wu wei&quot; in his piece &quot;Non-Activity&quot;.

Psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown has examined &quot;wu wei&quot; in the context of Western psychotherapy. Brown links &quot;wu wei&quot; with the psychoanalytic notion of enactment.

<text>The Chicago Water Tower is a contributing property and landmark in the Old Chicago Water Tower District in Chicago, Illinois, United States, that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built to enclose the tall machinery of a powerful water pump in 1869, it became particularly well known when it survived the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, although adjacent buildings burned to the ground.

==Description==
The tower is located at 806 Michigan Avenue along the Magnificent Mile shopping district in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois in a small park, the Jane M. Byrne Plaza. The tower was constructed to house a large water pump, intended to draw water from Lake Michigan. Built in 1869, it is the second-oldest water tower in the United States, after the Louisville Water Tower in Louisville, Kentucky.

The Chicago Water Tower now serves as a Chicago Office of Tourism as a small art gallery known as the City Gallery in the Historic Water Tower. It features the work of local photographers, artists and filmmakers.

==History==

The tower, built in 1869 by architect William W. Boyington from yellowing Lemont limestone, is 182.5 feet (55 m) tall. Inside was a 138-foot (42 m) high standpipe to hold water. In addition to being used for firefighting, the pressure in the pipe could be regulated to control water surges in the area. Together with the adjacent Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, it drew clean water from water cribs in Lake Michigan.

The tower gained prominence after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The tower was the only public building in the burned zone to survive, and is one of just a few of the surviving structures still standing. A few other buildings in the burned district did survive along with the tower.

Ironically, the pumping station stopped working during the fire. The roof, not made of limestone, caught fire and the pumps stopped working, stopped supplying water to fight the fire. “Many Chicagoans know that the Water Tower survived the fire. During the blaze, the roof caught fire and collapsed into the pumps, destroying them, along with any hope that there would be enough water to stop the spread of the fire. But the structure itself survived.”

In the years since the fire, the tower has become a symbol of old Chicago and of the city&#x27;s recovery from the fire. In 1918, when Pine Street was widened, the plans were altered in order to give the Water Tower a featured location in the city.

The tower has undergone two renovations. The first took place during a three-year period, 1913–1916. At that time many of the limestone blocks were replaced. The second renovation occurred in 1978. This renovation consisted mostly of interior changes with only minor changes made to the exterior of the building. In 2014, the small park the tower is sited in was named for former Chicago mayor Jane Byrne.

The structure has not been universally admired. Oscar Wilde said it looked like &quot;a castellated monstrosity with pepper boxes stuck all over it,&quot; although he did admire the arrangement and movement of the pumping machinery inside. The Water Tower&#x27;s castle-like style inspired the design of some White Castle restaurant buildings. The Tower was named an American Water Landmark in 1969. In 2004 and 2017, the tower was featured in the finales of &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Race 29&quot; respectively.

<text>Pelotas () is a Brazilian city and municipality (&quot;município&quot;), the fourth most populous in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, after Porto Alegre, Caxias do Sul and Canoas. It is located 270 km (168 mi) from Porto Alegre, the state&#x27;s capital city, and 130 km (80.8 mi) from the Uruguayan border. The Lagoa dos Patos lies to the east and the São Gonçalo Channel lies to the south, separating Pelotas from the city of Rio Grande.

In the 19th century, Pelotas was Brazil&#x27;s leading center for the production of dried meat (&quot;charque&quot;), a staple food made by slaves and destined to feed the slaves of sugarcane, coffee and cocoa plantations across the country.

Currently Pelotas hosts two major universities, the Federal University of Pelotas, and the Catholic University of Pelotas. Together, they account for a population of 22 thousand higher education students.

The city has three football clubs: Esporte Clube Pelotas (founded 1908), Grêmio Esportivo Brasil (also known as &quot;Brasil de Pelotas&quot;; founded 1911) and Grêmio Atlético Farroupilha (founded 1926).

==History==

The history of the city begins in June 1758, through a donation that Gomes Freire de Andrade, Count of Bobadela, made to Colonel Thomáz Luiz Osório, giving him land that lay on the banks of the Lagoa dos Patos. In 1763, fleeing the Spanish invasion, many inhabitants of the village Rio Grande sought refuge in the land belonging to Osório. Later, there also came refugees from Colônia do Sacramento, which had been handed over by the Portuguese to the Spanish in 1777.

In 1780, the Portuguese rancher José Pinto Martins established himself in Pelotas,with the prosperity of his establishment stimulating the creation of other ranches and growth in the region, creating a population that would define the early city.

The Civil Parish of São Francisco de Paula, founded on 7 June 1812, by Father Pedro Pereira de Mesquita, was elevated to the category of town on 7 April 1832. Three years later, in 1835, the town was declared a city, bearing the name Pelotas.

In southern Brazil, &#x27;pelota&#x27; can refer to a leather raft, and the name of the city comes from the boats made of cockspur coral tree covered with animal skins, used to cross rivers in ranching times.

In the first years of the 20th century, progress was stimulated by the Banco Pelotense (Bank of Pelotas), founded in 1906 by local investors. Its liquidation, in 1931, was devastating to the local economy.

In 1990, the Urban Conurbation of Pelotas was created as a result of a state law. In 2001, it became the Urban Conurbation of Pelotas and Rio Grande, and in 2002 the Urban Conurbation of the South. The goal is to integrate the participating towns and is the embryo of a future metropolitan region including the towns os Arroio do Padre, Capão do Leão, Pelotas, Rio Grande and São José do Norte, which have a total population of around 600,000 inhabitants.

==Geography==
===Topography===
As it is situated on a plain near the ocean, the urban area lies on a low elevation, being, on average, 7 meters (23 ft) above sea level. The interior of the municipality is on a plateau called Serras de Sudeste (Southeastern Mountain Ranges). Consequently, the altitude in Pelotas&#x27; rural area reaches 429 meters (1,407.4 ft) in the Quilombo district.

The city stretches to the Laranjal, a bairro on the coast of the Lagoa dos Patos. Beyond the coastal regions Santo Antônio and Valverde, the area also has an even more remote area, the Balneário dos Prazeres (popularly known as Barro Duro, lit. &quot;hard mud&quot;), and Colônia Z-3, a fishing village that primarily explores the art of shrimping.

===Climate===
The climate is humid subtropical (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;), a type found in Southeastern Australia (very homogeneous to Sydney, in terms of temperatures, albeit cloudier and wetter), without major temperature deviations as found in Brunswick and Savannah, Georgia (USA), and in Shanghai, China (but still considered very high by Brazilian standards), due to the continentality and polar vortex position in those southern cities of the United States and the Chinese city. Summers are warm to hot with regular rainfall. Winters are cool with episodic frosts (about 24 per year) and fog, with no noticeable difference in the amount of monthly rainfall.

The hottest month is January, with an average temperature of 23 °C (73.4 °F), and the coldest month is July, with an average temperature of 12 °C (53.6 °F). The wettest month is February, with 145 mm (5.7 in) of precipitation. The average annual temperature in the city is 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) and the average annual precipitation is 1,379 mm (54.29 in), with rain regularly falling all year long. The relative humidity is very high (with an annual average around 80%).

An interesting meteorological occurrence was the first snowfall, which occurred on 8 July 1994 in Pelotas from 11:00 am to 1:30 pm. Before this date, there had never been any record of snow in the city. The phenomenon was weaker in the urban parts of the city, and did not cover the ground. However, the snowfall was more intense further inland, in districts such as Cascata and Quilombo, and was able to cover the vegetation in a white blanket.

===Vegetation===

The larger part of rural Pelotas is made up of grasslands, with low and herbaceous vegetation (pampa). Small groves of cultivated trees (Babylon willow, eucalyptus, pine, cypress, acacia, poplar and platanus) and native trees (Cockspur coral tree and araucaria angustifolia) are also found. Pelotas is 55 km (34 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean, and possesses a beach along the Lagoa dos Patos, called Laranjal. In the vicinity of the beach one can find quagmires and sand dunes.

===Hydrography===
Pelotas is part of the watershed of the Camaquã River. The streams Quilombo and Caneleiras drain the city. They meet to form the Arroio de Pelotas, which flows into the São Gonçalo Channel.

== Culture ==

===Places of interest===
The &quot;Public Library of Pelotas&quot; was founded in 1875, and constructed with materials brought over from Europe. Pelotas has two theatres, the &quot;Sete de Abril&quot; and the &quot;Guarani Theatre&quot;. The Sete de Abril, which was constructed in 1831, is one of the most traditional theatres in Brazil. The city boasts four major museums: the &quot;Carlos Ritter Museum of Natural History&quot;, the &quot;Leopoldo Gotuzzo Museum of Art&quot;, the &quot;Candy Museum&quot;, and the &quot;Museum of the Baroness&quot;.

===Events===
One major attraction is the Fenadoce, a display of sweets prepared from traditional 18th century Portuguese recipes. More than 300,000 people come to the annual event, which began in 1986. Formerly held in different locations each year, today it is always celebrated in the &quot;Centro Internacional de Cultura e Eventos&quot; (International Center of Culture and Events).

==Demographics==

===Ethnicities===
The first immigrants to the region were the Portuguese, coming mostly from the Azores, something which profoundly influenced the culture of the city, especially in its architecture and cuisine.
Another important immigration was that of the Germans (the majority from Pomerania — see Pomeranians), even though they preferred to settle in rural areas, unlike the Portuguese, who settled in the city itself. Also worthy to mention are other ethnicities that settled in Pelotas, such as Africans (descendants of slaves, mainly from Angola), Italians, Poles, French, Jews, Lebanese Arabs, etc. The number of descendants from indigenous peoples, despite being unknown, is probably very small.

Before the arrival of the first European settlers, the area of the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul, including the municipality of Pelotas, was occupied by Amerindian groups. According to archaeological evidence discovered there, the groups were: Minuane, Charrua and Guaraní.

In the 2022 census there were 247,257 whites, 38,691 blacks, 39,107 of mixed ethnicities, 363 native Brazilians and 264 Asians.

===Religion===
In regards to religion, the majority of inhabitants (about 50%) are Roman Catholic, followed by Protestant religions (especially among the people of German origin), such as Evangelical Lutheran and Anglican sects. In recent times there has also been a growing number of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Latter-day Saints. Other noteworthy religions include Spiritism and Afro-Brazilian ritualism (such as Umbanda and Candomblé).

==Economy==

The economy of Pelotas is mostly agricultural and commercial. The latter is largely represented by Arabs, mostly Lebanese (erroneously referred to as &quot;turcos&quot;, or Turks), and a few other foreigners.

The region is the largest producer of peaches for the country&#x27;s storehouse industry, along with other products such as asparagus, cucumber, fig and strawberries. The city also is a great producer of rice and cattle products. Pelotas produces more milk than anywhere else in the state.

Pelotas has industries tied to agriculture, textile, leather tanning and bread-making. Reforestation for the production of paper and cellulose has been a rising economic activity in the whole region.

The city is a large commercial center in the region, attracting shoppers to its sidewalk and neighborhood galleries and shops.

The rural area, also called the &quot;colony&quot;, due to the fact that German immigrants built isolated farming communities there, is characterized by the production of fruit, rice, and livestock.

In times past the production of &quot;charque&quot;, or dried beef, was economically important. The work was usually done by slaves. The &quot;charqueadas&quot;, as the livestock ranches were called, are still popular tourist attractions, the most famous being the Charqueada Santa Rita and the Charqueada São João.

==Transportation==
Pelotas International Airport, which was originally built in 1930, serves 130,000 passengers annually with two runways. It is located in the neighborhood of Três Vendas.

The city also has a bus system, a port on the shores of the São Gonçalo Channel, and the junction of two major highways (BR-116 and BR-392) nearby.

==Architecture==
The city was strongly influence by Portuguese aesthetics, visible in its large houses with Portuguese ceramics on the façade. Pelotas is very rich in architectural treasures and monuments.
One example of the many monuments in the city is a fountain called, &quot;As Três Meninas&quot;, which came from France in 1873, and was placed in the center of the city.
The largest monument in Pelotas is the iron &quot;Caixa d&#x27;água&quot;, which is located in the Piratinino de Almeida Square, and is the only one of its kind in all of Latin America. It was constructed in 1875, and still holds the daily surplus of water in the city. It sits atop 45 columns, and all of its pieces are made of iron. It has forms that are reminiscent of Asian architecture, though all of the materials used in construction were imported from France.

The architecture of the city is distinguished by its churches, the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; and the &quot;Public Market&quot;.
The construction of the &quot;Public Market&quot; was initiated in 1847 and finished in 1853, although between 1911 and 1914 there was a renovation. Its design was fashioned after the Neoclassical style, and was affected by Art Nouveau after 1970 when the building was destroyed by a fire and rebuilt. On it there is a clock tower and an iron lighthouse, imported from Hamburg, Germany, an allusion to the Eiffel Tower.

The &quot;Great Hotel&quot; was inaugurated in 1928. The building has four floors, presented in the Art Nouveau style. Today the building is closed and belongs to the city government.
The &quot;Church of the Redeemer&quot;, also known as the &quot;Shaggy Church&quot;, is the headquarters of the Brazilian Episcopalian Church of the Anglican Communion, and became known for its characteristic vegetal covering. It opened its doors in 1892. Its tower is 27 meters tall, and its stained-glass windows are from New York City.
The &quot;São Francisco de Paula Metropolitan Cathedral&quot; is considered the city&#x27;s and the region most important religious edifice, due to its size, beauty and the works of art found within its interior. Its construction began in 1813. The cathedral shelters the image of Saint Francis of Paola, by an unknown artist, which was brought from Colônia do Sacramento.

The painter Aldo Locatelli, came from Italy especially to make the frescoes on the ceiling and walls of the cathedral, at the invitation of Dom Antônio Záttera, bishop of Pelotas at the time. Although Locatelli would choose to stay in Rio Grande do Sul and make many other important works in Brazil, including paintings and murals, this is considered his greatest work, together with the passion at the &quot;Church of São Pelegrino&quot; in Caxias do Sul.
Also deserving attention is the &quot;Museum of the Baroness&quot;, which was constructed in the 19th century, occupying an area of approximately 7 hectares, possessing 22 parts and an interior patio. Lining it all were many cultivated and varied gardens.

In Pelotas there are still nine sculptures of Antônio Caringi, considered the best gaúcho sculptor. Among them are: &quot;Oferenda,&quot; 1942, in bronze, located in the Ecumenical Cemetery São Francisco de Paula; &quot;Monumento ao Colono,&quot; 1958, in bronze and granite, in the Primeiro de Maio Square; &quot;Monumento ao Bispo Dom Joaquim Ferreira de Mello,&quot; 1942, in bronze and granite, on the Avenue Dom Joaquim; &quot;Sentinela Farroupilha,&quot; 1935, in bronze, 20 de Setembro Square; &quot;As Três Idades do Trabalho,&quot; in granite, Coronel Pedro Osório Square; &quot;Dr. Luiz Pereira Lima,&quot; 1958, in bronze, Piratinino de Almeida Square; &quot;Monumento ao Coronel Pedro Osório,&quot; 1954, in bronze and granite, Coronel Pedro Osório Square; &quot;Monumento à Mãe,&quot; 1968, in bronze and granite, Coronel Pedro Osório Square; &quot;Monumento ao Dr. José Brusque&quot; 1968, in bronze and granite, Coronel Pedro Osório Square.

<text>HMS &quot;Argus&quot; was a British aircraft carrier that served in the Royal Navy from 1918 to 1944. She was converted from an ocean liner that was under construction when the First World War began and became the first aircraft carrier with a full-length flight deck that allowed wheeled aircraft to take off and land. After commissioning, the ship was involved for several years in the development of the optimum design for other aircraft carriers. &quot;Argus&quot; also evaluated various types of arresting gear, general procedures needed to operate a number of aircraft in concert and fleet tactics. The ship was too top-heavy as originally built, and had to be modified to improve her stability in the mid-1920s. She spent one brief deployment on the China Station in the late 1920s before being placed in reserve for budgetary reasons.

&quot;Argus&quot; was recommissioned and partially modernised shortly before the Second World War and served as a training ship for deck-landing practice until June 1940. The following month she made the first of her many ferry trips to the Western Mediterranean to fly off fighters to Malta; she was largely occupied in this task for the next two years. The ship also delivered aircraft to Murmansk, Russia, Takoradi in the Gold Coast, and Reykjavík, Iceland. By 1942, the Royal Navy was very short of aircraft carriers, and &quot;Argus&quot; was pressed into front-line service despite her lack of speed and armament. In June, she participated in Operation Harpoon, providing air cover for the Malta-bound convoy. In November, the ship provided air cover during Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa, and was slightly damaged by a bomb. After returning to the UK for repairs, &quot;Argus&quot; was used again for deck-landing practice until late September 1944. In December, she became an accommodation ship, and was listed for disposal in mid-1946. The ship was sold in late 1946 and scrapped the following year.

==Design, description and construction==
&quot;Argus&quot; had her genesis in the Admiralty&#x27;s desire during the First World War for an aircraft carrier that could fly off wheeled aircraft and land them aboard. Existing carriers could launch wheeled aircraft, but had no way to recover them as they lacked flight decks. In 1912, the ship builder William Beardmore and Company had proposed to the Admiralty an aircraft carrier design with a continuous, full-length flight deck, but it was not accepted. As the limitations of existing carriers became more apparent, this design was dusted off and the Admiralty located two large, fast hulls suitable for conversion into an aircraft carrier. Construction of the Italian ocean liners &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; and &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; had been suspended by Beardmore at the outbreak of the war, and both met the Admiralty&#x27;s criteria. &quot;Conte Rosso&quot; was purchased on 20 September 1916, possibly because her machinery was more complete than that of &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, and the company began work on converting the ship.

James Graham, 6th Duke of Montrose, a director of the Beardmore company, proposed to the Admiralty a design, &quot;A Parent Ship for Naval Aeroplanes and Torpedo Boat Destroyer&quot; in 1912. The initial design had two islands with the flight deck running between them. Each island contained one funnel; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. The islands were connected by braces and the bridge was mounted on top of the bracing, which left a clear height of for the aircraft on the flight deck. Fairly early in the design process, the decision was made to delete the funnels to reduce turbulence over the flight deck. The exhaust gases were, instead, ducted aft in the space between the roof of the hangar deck and the flight deck and were enclosed by a casing through which cooler air was driven by electric fans. They normally exhausted underneath the aft end of the flight deck, but the exhaust could be vented through openings on the rear side of the hull by two large electric fans.

In November 1916, the ship&#x27;s design was tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory to evaluate the turbulence caused by the twin islands and the bridge over them. They were found to cause problems, but no changes were made until the ship was nearly complete. In April 1918, &quot;Argus&quot; was ordered to be modified to a flush-decked configuration after the sea trials of the carrier had revealed severe turbulence problems caused by her superstructure. The ship was given a bridge underneath her flight deck, extending from side to side, and she was fitted with a retractable pilot house in the middle of the flight deck for use when not operating aircraft.

&quot;Argus&quot;″s stability had been a concern from the beginning. Despite having been originally conceived as a liner with a hull designed to minimise rolling, most of the changes made to the ship during her conversion added topside weight, raising her centre of gravity. Even the addition of of ballast still left the ship with a very low metacentric height of only lightly loaded and at deep load. This meant she was very steady, but heeled noticeably when turning. The ship proved to be very manoeuvrable at medium and high speeds, but steered badly at low speeds and in wind due to her large surface area.

&quot;Argus&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. She displaced at standard load and at deep load. Each of the ship&#x27;s four sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft. Steam was supplied by 12 cylindrical boilers. The turbines were designed for a total of , but they produced during her sea trials in September 1918, and gave &quot;Argus&quot; a speed of . The ship carried of fuel oil, which gave her a range of at .

The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long and her hangar was long, wide, and high. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts; the forward lift measured and the rear . &quot;Argus&quot; was the only British carrier serving in the Second World War capable of striking down (stowing away) aircraft with non-folding wings because of her wide lifts and tall hangar ceiling. Three fire curtains divided the hangar and another separated the hangar and the quarterdeck. She could accommodate between 15 and 18 aircraft. No arresting gear was fitted as completed. Two large cranes were positioned on the quarterdeck, beneath the rear of the flight deck. Petrol storage consisted of in tins stowed below the waterline. The ship&#x27;s crew totalled 495 officers and men.

The ship was armed with four  anti-aircraft guns, two on the quarterdeck and one on each side of the hull. She was also fitted with two low-angle 4-inch guns, one also on each side of the hull. The rear magazine and the torpedo warhead storage magazine were protected by a total of of protective plating on all sides, but the forward magazine and bomb storage rooms had only a 2-inch thick deck to protect them.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Argus&quot;, named after Argus of the 100 Eyes from Greek mythology, was laid down in 1914 as yard number 519 by Beardmore at its shipyard in Dalmuir as the &quot;Conte Rosso&quot;. She was renamed after her purchase in September 1916 and was launched on 2 December 1917, construction having been slowed by labour shortages, and commissioned on 16 September 1918. The ship was nicknamed the &quot;Hat Box&quot;, &quot;Ditty Box&quot; or the &quot;Flatiron&quot; because of her flat-topped appearance.

===1918–1939===
After commissioning too late to participate in the First World War, &quot;Argus&quot; was tasked to conduct deck-landing trials with longitudinal arresting gear transferred from &quot;Furious&quot;. The first landings on the ship were made on 24 September1918 by two Sopwith Ship Strutter aeroplanes from the Grand Fleet&#x27;s airbase at Turnhouse. The same month, the ship was used in trials to evaluate the effects which an island superstructure would have on flying operations, with a canvas-and-wood dummy island being installed with a smoke box to simulate funnel gases. By 19 December, 36 successful landings had been made by Ship Strutters and Sopwith Pups. &quot;Argus&quot; was refitted from 23 December to 21 March 1919 with modified arresting gear. The wires of the arresting gear had been lifted off the deck so they could engage the hooks on the undercarriages of the aircraft, but this prevented the use of the flight deck for any other purpose. The after lift was therefore lowered , which allowed aircraft to use the area when the lift was raised flush with the rest of the flight deck. Trials began in April and the lift was widened in October. &quot;Argus&quot; joined the Atlantic Fleet in January 1920 for its Spring Cruise carrying a total of sixteen airplanes: eight Ship Strutters, four Sopwith Camel fighters, two Airco DH.9A bombers and two Fairey floatplanes. Operational experience confirmed that the aircraft should attempt to land directly onto the arresting gear lest they be blown over the side of the carrier, as happened three times during the cruise.

After the ship&#x27;s return from its cruise, a conference was convened aboard &quot;Argus&quot; on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements. It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed, and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed. Powered palisades were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire. The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier later in the year and &quot;Argus&quot;″ arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise, during which the ship carried ten Parnall Panther spotter and reconnaissance aircraft and three Fairey IIIC reconnaissance aircraft. In addition, the ship&#x27;s aft lift was permanently locked in the raised position and of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship. This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made, only two of which resulted in serious accidents, an accident rate comparable to those of land-based units. The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise, primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start.

In September 1922, &quot;Argus&quot;, equipped with Gloster Nightjar fighters, was deployed to the Dardanelles as a response to the Chanak crisis. As well as operating her own aircraft, &quot;Argus&quot; was used to fly off Bristol Fighters that had been ferried to the Dardanelles aboard the seaplane carrier to an airfield at Kilia on the European side of the straits. (The aircraft could not be flown off &quot;Ark Royal&quot; since it was a seaplane carrier with no flight deck. The Bristol Fighters were transferred to &quot;Argus&quot; by crane).

In July 1922, &quot;Argus&quot; was inclined to evaluate her stability in light of the additional weights that had been added since her completion and it was discovered that her metacentric height had been reduced by . The Director of Naval Construction proposed to fit her with a girdle at her waterline to increase her beam and thus her stability. He intended to do this under the 1923–1924 Naval Programme, but this was delayed several times as the ship was needed for training and when she was finally modified it was under the 1925–1926 Naval Programme. Girdling increased her deep displacement to and her beam to , and reduced her draught to and her speed by a quarter of a knot. The ship was also fitted with bulk petrol storage, new four-inch guns that used fixed ammunition, and new radio masts.

&quot;Argus&quot; usually operated about 15 aircraft during the 1920s. This was commonly divided up between one small flight of fighters (Gloster Nightjars or Fairey Flycatchers), one of spotters (Parnall Panthers or Avro Bisons), and one spotter reconnaissance flight with Fairey IIIs.

The ship&#x27;s hull was surveyed in 1927 and anticipated to be sound for another 15 years, and she relieved on the China Station from 1September to 20 March 1928. Sometime after her return, &quot;Argus&quot; was laid up at Plymouth at 14-days readiness to save money. Since she was completed before 9December 1921, the Washington Naval Treaty classified her as an experimental aircraft carrier and thus she did not need to be scrapped to release treaty-limited tonnage for new construction. The ship was reduced to Extended Reserve (four months readiness) at Rosyth in September 1932. In February 1936, it was decided to refit the ship as a tender for Queen Bee target drones. The opportunity was taken to widen her flight deck by and replace her old boilers with destroyer-type boilers which could generate more steam than her turbines could handle. The boilers were taken from scrapped destroyers of the V and W class which were being broken up at Inverkeithing. The ship was intended to have one hydro-pneumatic aircraft catapult, but this was instead diverted to . Since &quot;Argus&quot; was now classified as a naval auxiliary, her four-inch guns were removed. Her refit was completed on 30 July 1938 and she underwent sea trials the following month. She was classified as a Target Aeroplane Carrier and recommissioned on 11 August 1938 with Captain W. G. Benn in command.

===Second World War===
After recommissioning, &quot;Argus&quot; served as a training carrier to allow pilots to practice their deck-landing skills. She was carrying out this duty in the Gulf of Lion when the Second World War began. By April 1940, the ship had been rearmed with two QF MkV 4-inch anti-aircraft guns on her quarterdeck, as well as three quadruple Vickers .50machine gun mounts; one of these was on each side of her hull and the third was on the centreline of the quarterdeck. Together with the battlecruiser and six destroyers, &quot;Argus&quot; escorted Convoy US-3, loaded with Australian and New Zealand troops, to the United Kingdom in mid-June. A week later, she ferried Supermarine Walrus amphibians of 701 Squadron to Reykjavík, Iceland. &quot;Argus&quot; loaded a dozen Hawker Hurricane and two Blackburn Skua fighters of 418 Flight RAF in late July for delivery to Malta as part of Operation Hurry. Escorted by &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, three battleships, two cruisers and 10 destroyers, the ship flew them off without incident on 2August 1940 from a point west of Sicily, although two of the Hurricanes crashed on landing. Accompanied by the battleship and escorted by two destroyers, she returned to Liverpool to load 30 Hurricanes with their wings removed. &quot;Argus&quot; sailed on 22 August and arrived at Takoradi on the Gold Coast on 5September where her aircraft were off-loaded. After her return to the United Kingdom, the ship was briefly refitted and she ferried 701 Squadron back to the United Kingdom in late October.

On 11 November, &quot;Argus&quot; sailed again from Liverpool with a deck-load of a dozen Hurricanes and two Skuas for delivery to Malta (Operation White). She rendezvoused with Force H four days later and launched the aircraft on the morning of 17 November. Eight of the Hurricanes ran out of fuel en route due to headwinds and one Skua was forced to crash land on Sicily after it had been damaged by Italian flak. In mid-December, the ship embarked six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 821X Squadron for delivery to Gibraltar and another pair of Swordfish from 825 Squadron for self-defence. The carrier rendezvoused with &quot;Furious&quot; and Convoy WS-5A before the combined force was discovered by the on 25 December, but little damage was inflicted by &quot;Hipper&quot; before she was driven off by the escorts. No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in &quot;Argus&quot; with bombs that they could not carry and the torpedoes were aboard &quot;Furious&quot;. After &quot;Furious&quot;″s Skuas had flown off to search for &quot;Hipper&quot;, space was cleared to allow &quot;Argus&quot;″ Swordfish to load the torpedoes, but the Skuas could not locate &quot;Hipper&quot; because of the poor visibility. &quot;Argus&quot; delivered 821X Squadron to Gibraltar and was back in the United Kingdom by 14 January 1941.

In March, the carrier loaded a dozen Hurricane IIs and three Skuas and delivered them to Gibraltar on 29 March, where they were loaded onto &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and flown off to Malta a few days later. She returned to the United Kingdom on 11 April and loaded six replacement Swordfish as well as six Swordfish of 812 Squadron for self-defence. After a brief refit, &quot;Argus&quot; sailed on 14 April for Gibraltar to transfer the replacements to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. She arrived on 24 April and began a two-week refit after the aircraft were transferred. The ship was back in the United Kingdom, loading another batch of Hurricanes bound for Gibraltar. Three Fulmars of 800X Squadron were also embarked to protect the ship against the Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condors that patrolled the Bay of Biscay and the Eastern Atlantic. The carrier arrived on 31 May and disembarked all her aircraft, including 800X Squadron. On her return to the United Kingdom she began a refit.

In late August to early September, &quot;Argus&quot; transported 24 Hurricanes of No. 151 Wing RAF to Murmansk, Russia. She then ferried a dozen Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of 828 Squadron to Gibraltar on 30 September for eventual delivery to Malta. She was to ferry the fighters of 804 Squadron on her return trip to England, but this was cancelled. Eventually, the ship loaded some damaged aircraft and accompanied &quot;Eagle&quot; back to the United Kingdom on 20 October. &quot;Argus&quot; loaded more Hurricanes for Gibraltar and also embarked a pair of Swordfish from 818 Squadron and two Sea Hurricanes from 804X Squadron for self-defence. The ship arrived on 8November and she transferred some of her Hurricanes to Ark Royal. Two days later, the two carriers, in Operation Perpetual, sailed to the west of Sicily and flew off their 37 Hurricanes; three of the fighters were lost en route. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was torpedoed and sunk during the return to Gibraltar, which forced &quot;Argus&quot; to remain there to provide cover for Force H as the sole carrier available.

====1942–1946====

Force H was recalled to the United Kingdom in January and &quot;Argus&quot; loaded 12 Swordfish of 812 Squadron for her own protection. Whilst in the United Kingdom, she loaded some Supermarine Spitfire fighters and returned to Gibraltar on 24 February. There, the ship transferred the Spitfires to &quot;Eagle&quot; and embarked nine Fairey Fulmar fighters of 807 Squadron. The plan for Operation Spotter I was for &quot;Argus&quot; to provide fighter cover for &quot;Eagle&quot; as she flew off the Spitfires for Malta, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off. During Operation Picket I, nine more Spitfires were flown off by &quot;Eagle&quot; on 21 March whilst a dozen Sea Hurricane IIBs from 804 Squadron provided air cover from &quot;Argus&quot;. The two carriers repeated the delivery on 29 March when &quot;Eagle&quot; flew off seven more Spitfires whilst 807 Squadron provided air cover from &quot;Argus&quot;. The latter ship also carried six Albacores bound for Malta as well, but the weather deteriorated over Malta and their fly-off was cancelled.

Another attempt to deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during Operation LB. As usual, &quot;Argus&quot; provided the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and &quot;Eagle&quot; ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their take-off point for Malta on 19 May. The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and they were forced to return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to &quot;Winter&quot; rather than &quot;Summer&quot;. One of the Fulmars was shot down by Vichy French Dewoitine D.520 fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that had been shot down earlier. By this time the ship&#x27;s Vickers .50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns.

Afterwards, the ship returned to the UK to ferry 801 Squadron to Gibraltar and delivered the unit on 7June. Together with &quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Argus&quot; was tasked to provide air cover over Force H as it covered a convoy attempting to get desperately needed supplies through to Malta later in June (Operation Harpoon). The carrier embarked two Fulmars from 807 Squadron, nine Swordfish from 813 Squadron and four more Swordfish from 824 Squadron to protect the convoy from submarines while &quot;Eagle&quot; loaded 20 Fulmars and Sea Hurricanes from three different squadrons. One Swordfish crashed while landing on 13 June and the wreckage was pushed over the side. Both Fulmars from 807 Squadron were shot down on 14 June by Italian bombers, but they likely shot down one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 and one CANT Z.1007 bomber. &quot;Eagle&quot; transferred her Fulmars to &quot;Argus&quot; over the course of the battle and two more were lost later in the day. The ship was attacked multiple times by bombs and torpedoes during the battle without effect.

As part of the preparations for another resupply convoy for Malta (Operation Pedestal), &quot;Argus&quot; returned to the United Kingdom in late June to load reserve aircraft, including six Sea Hurricanes of 804 Squadron, for the other aircraft carriers involved in the operation and left the Clyde on 2August for Gibraltar. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 5August for a three-day training exercise to work out co-ordination procedures before the operation commenced and 804 Squadron was deemed not ready for combat. It was ordered to return to the UK aboard &quot;Argus&quot;.

In November 1942, &quot;Argus&quot; was assigned to the Eastern Naval Task Force that invaded Algiers, Algeria, during the Allied landings in French North Africa with 18 Supermarine Seafire IICs of 880 Squadron aboard. The ship was hit by a bomb on 10 November that killed four men. She and the escort carrier joined a convoy returning to the United Kingdom on the evening of 14/15 November that was spotted by the Germans. Later that morning torpedoed and sank &quot;Avenger&quot;, which was right behind &quot;Argus&quot; in the convoy. &quot;Argus&quot; was under repair for a month after she reached the United Kingdom, but required a more thorough refit that lasted from February to May 1943. Reclassified as an escort carrier after the completion of her refit, she was relegated to deck-landing training. She was ordered to be paid off on 27 January 1944, but this order was apparently revoked as she continued training until 27 September 1944 when the last take-off was made from her deck, a Fairey Swordfish. In March, she was ordered to be converted to an aircraft freighter around the end of the year, but this plan was also apparently cancelled. &quot;Argus&quot; became an accommodation ship at Chatham in December and she was approved for scrapping on 6May 1946. She was sold to Thos. W. Ward on 5December 1946 and arrived at Inverkeithing later that month to be broken up. The ship&#x27;s bell from &quot;Argus&quot; is preserved in Bristol Cathedral as a memorial to Canon Percival Gay, who was the warship&#x27;s last chaplain.

<doc id="684999" wikidata="Q2736850" url="?curid=684999" title="One-piece swimsuit">
<text>A one-piece swimsuit most commonly refers to swimwear worn primarily by women and girls when swimming in the sea or in a swimming pool, playing water polo, or for any activity in the sun, such as sun bathing. Today, the one-piece swimsuit is usually a skin-tight garment that covers the torso, although some designs expose the back or upper chest.

Before the popularity of the two-piece swimsuit, and then the bikini, virtually all women&#x27;s swimwear completely covered at least the wearer&#x27;s torso, and men also wore similar swimsuits. While the bikini has increasingly found popular acceptance since the 1960s, the one-piece swimsuit has maintained a place on beaches to this day.

==Types and variations==
The most common type of one-piece suit is the maillot (a term that is not generally used anymore) or &quot;tank suit&quot;, which resembles a sleeveless leotard or bodysuit. There are variants of the one-piece swimsuit, including halterneck styles and plunge front swimsuits, as well as wrap-round (&quot;surplice&quot;) and bandeau styles. The pretzel suit is another style of the one-piece swimsuit. Recently, athletic swimsuits have used a variety of new shoulder strap styles, including the racerback, fastback, and flyback styles, some of which have also been used on other athletic wear. Another recent innovation in one-piece swimsuits is the bodyskin, which superficially resembles a unitard or wetsuit, covering the entire torso, arms, and legs. This serves to reduce friction through the water for professional swimmers. The surface is made of textured technical fabrics which are engineered to cut through the water in the same way as fish or sharkskin.

==History==

The modern one-piece swimsuit made its appearance in the mid-1900s, when the style was widely described as a maillot. Its widespread acceptance is attributed to Australian swimmer Annette Kellerman, who attracted further attention to the style when, in 1907, she was arrested on a Boston beach for indecent exposure because her swimsuit showed arms, legs and the neck, a costume she adopted from England, and which was similar to men&#x27;s swimsuits of the time. The arrest prompted a wide public outrage which added to the acceptance of the style. Kellerman marketed these bathing suits and the style came to be known as &quot;the Annette Kellerman&quot;. The one-piece swimsuit became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910, and other places, and was the authorised attire for women&#x27;s swimming at the 1912 Summer Olympics, the first at which women competed.

&quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; praised the Kellerman swimsuit, writing in June 1920 (vol. 55, no. 6, p. 138): &quot;Annette Kellerman Bathing Attire is distinguished by an incomparable, daring beauty of fit that always remains refined.&quot; The following year, in June 1921 (vol. 54, no. 2504, p. 101), it wrote that these bathing suits were &quot;famous ... for their perfect fit and exquisite, plastic beauty of line&quot;. In the United States, beauty pageants of women in bathing costumes became popular from the 1880s. However, such events were not regarded as respectable. Beauty contests became more respectable with the first modern &quot;Miss America&quot; contest held in 1921, though less respectable beauty contests continued to be held. Nevertheless, the Annette Kellerman continued to be considered by some as the most offensive style of swimsuit in the 1920s and became the focus of censorship efforts. Even in 1943, pictures of the Kellerman swimsuit were produced as evidence of indecency in &quot;Esquire v. Walker, Postmaster General&quot;.

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from &quot;taking in the water&quot; to &quot;taking in the sun&quot;, at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits, but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic, with jersey and silk also sometimes being used.

By the 1930s, the necklines of women&#x27;s swimwear plunged at the back, sleeves disappeared, and sides were cut away and tightened. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly latex and nylon, through the 1930s, swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning. 
Since the 1960s, the bikini has increasingly found popular acceptance, though the one-piece swimsuit has maintained a place on beaches to this day. Heim&#x27;s two-piece has fallen out of fashion.

<text>A diesel–electric transmission, or diesel–electric powertrain, is a transmission system powered by diesel engines for vehicles in road, rail, and marine transport. Diesel–electric transmission is similar to petrol–electric transmission, which is powered by petrol engines.

Diesel–electric transmission is used on railways by diesel–electric locomotives and diesel–electric multiple units, as electric motors are able to supply full torque from 0 RPM. Diesel–electric systems are also used in marine transport, including submarines, and on some other land vehicles.

== Description ==

The defining characteristic of diesel–electric transmission is that it avoids the need for a gearbox, by converting the mechanical force of the diesel engine into electrical energy (through an alternator), and using the electrical energy to drive traction motors, which propel the vehicle mechanically. The traction motors may be powered directly or via rechargeable batteries, making the vehicle a type of hybrid electric vehicle. This method of transmission is sometimes termed electric transmission, as it is identical to petrol–electric transmission, which is used on vehicles powered by petrol engines, and to turbine–electric powertrain, which is used for gas turbines.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Diesel–electric transmissions are a type of continuously variable transmission. The absence of a gearbox eliminates the need for gear changes, which prevents uneven acceleration caused by the disengagement of a clutch. With auxiliary batteries the motors can run on electric alone, for example when the noise or exhaust from the engine disrupts a clean air zone.

Disadvantages of a diesel electric transmission are the potential complexity, cost, and decreased efficiency due to energy conversion. Diesel engines and electric motors are both known for having high torque at low rpm, this may leave high rpm with little torque. Typically a petrol engine is paired with electric motors for this reason. Petrol engine produces most torque at high rpm, supplemented by electric motors&#x27; low rpm torque.

==Ships==

The first diesel motorship was also the first diesel–electric ship, the Russian tanker &quot;Vandal&quot; from Branobel, which was launched in 1903. Steam turbine–electric propulsion has been in use since the 1920s (s), using diesel–electric powerplants in surface ships has increased lately. The Finnish coastal defence ships &quot;Ilmarinen&quot; and &quot;Väinämöinen&quot; laid down in 1928–1929, were among the first surface ships to use diesel–electric transmission. Later, the technology was used in diesel powered icebreakers.

In World War II, the United States Navy built diesel–electric surface warships. Due to machinery shortages destroyer escorts of the and es were diesel–electric, with half their designed horsepower (The and es were full-power steam turbine–electric). The s, on the other hand, were designed for diesel–electric propulsion because of its flexibility and resistance to damage.

Some modern diesel–electric ships, including cruise ships and icebreakers, use electric motors in pods called azimuth thrusters underneath to allow for 360° rotation, making the ships far more maneuverable. An example of this is &quot;Symphony of the Seas&quot;, the largest passenger ship as of 2019.

Gas turbines are also used for electrical power generation and some ships use a combination: &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot; has a set of diesel engines in the bottom of the ship plus two gas turbines mounted near the main funnel; all are used for generating electrical power, including those used to drive the propellers. This provides a relatively simple way to use the high-speed, low-torque output of a turbine to drive a low-speed propeller, without the need for excessive reduction gearing.

===Submarines===

Most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and propeller, switching between diesel engines for surface running and electric motors for submerged propulsion. This was effectively a &quot;parallel&quot; type of hybrid, since the motor and engine were coupled to the same shaft. On the surface, the motor (driven by the engine) was used as a generator to recharge the batteries and supply other electric loads. The engine would be disconnected for submerged operation, with batteries powering the electric motor and supplying all other power as well.

In a true diesel–electric transmission arrangement, by contrast, the propeller or propellers are always driven directly or through reduction gears by one or more electric motors, while one or more diesel generators provide electric energy for charging the batteries and driving the motors. While this solution comes with a few disadvantages compared to direct mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the propeller that was initially common, the advantages were eventually found to be more important. One of several significant advantages is that it mechanically isolates the noisy engine compartment from the outer pressure hull and reduces the acoustic signature of the submarine when surfaced. Some nuclear submarines also use a similar turbo-electric propulsion system, with propulsion turbo generators driven by reactor plant steam.

Among the pioneering users of true diesel–electric transmission was the Swedish Navy with its first submarine, HMS &quot;Hajen&quot; (later renamed &quot;Ub no 1&quot;), launched in 1904 and originally equipped with a semi-diesel engine (a hot-bulb engine primarily meant to be fueled by kerosene), later replaced by a true diesel. From 1909 to 1916, the Swedish Navy launched another seven submarines in three different classes (&quot;2nd&quot; class, &quot;Laxen&quot; class, and &quot;Braxen&quot; class), all using diesel–electric transmission. While Sweden temporarily abandoned diesel–electric transmission as it started to buy submarine designs from abroad in the mid-1910s, the technology was immediately reintroduced when Sweden began to design its own submarines again in the mid-1930s. From that point onwards, diesel–electric transmission has been consistently used for all new classes of Swedish submarines, albeit supplemented by air-independent propulsion (AIP) as provided by Stirling engines beginning with HMS &quot;Näcken&quot; in 1988.

Another early adopter of diesel–electric transmission was the United States Navy, whose Bureau of Steam Engineering proposed its use in 1928. It was subsequently tried in the S-class submarines , , and before being put into production with the &quot;Porpoise&quot; class of the 1930s. From that point onwards, it continued to be used on most US conventional submarines.

Apart from the British U-class and some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy that used separate diesel generators for low speed running, few navies other than those of Sweden and the US made much use of diesel–electric transmission before 1945. After World War II, by contrast, it gradually became the dominant mode of propulsion for conventional submarines. However, its adoption was not always swift. Notably, the Soviet Navy did not introduce diesel–electric transmission on its conventional submarines until 1980 with its &quot;Paltus&quot; class.

==Railway locomotives==
During World War I, there was a strategic need for rail engines without plumes of smoke above them. Diesel technology was not yet sufficiently developed but a few precursor attempts were made, especially for petrol–electric transmissions by the French (Crochat-Collardeau, patent dated 1912 also used for tanks and trucks) and British (Dick, Kerr &amp; Co and British Westinghouse). About 300 of these locomotives, only 96 being standard gauge, were in use at various points in the conflict.

In the 1920s, diesel–electric technology first saw limited use in switcher locomotives (UK: &quot;shunter locomotives&quot;), locomotives used for moving trains around in railroad yards and assembling and disassembling them. An early company offering &quot;Oil-Electric&quot; locomotives was the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). The ALCO HH series of diesel–electric switcher entered series production in 1931. In the 1930s, the system was adapted for streamliners, the fastest trains of their day. Diesel–electric powerplants became popular because they greatly simplified the way motive power was transmitted to the wheels and because they were both more efficient and had greatly reduced maintenance requirements. Direct-drive transmissions can become very complex, considering that a typical locomotive has four or more axles. Additionally, a direct-drive diesel locomotive would require an impractical number of gears to keep the engine within its powerband; coupling the diesel to a generator eliminates this problem. An alternative is to use a torque converter or fluid coupling in a direct drive system to replace the gearbox.

==Road and other land vehicles==

===Buses===


Diesel electric based buses have also been produced, including hybrid systems able to run on and store electrical power in batteries. The two main providers of hybrid systems for diesel–electric transit buses include Allison Transmission and BAE Systems. New Flyer Industries, Gillig Corporation, and North American Bus Industries are major customers for the Allison EP hybrid systems, while Orion Bus Industries and Nova Bus are major customer for the BAE HybriDrive system. Mercedes-Benz makes their own diesel–electric drive system, which is used in their Citaro. The only bus that runs on single diesel–electric transmission is the Mercedes Benz Cito low floor concept bus which was introduced in 1998.

===Trucks===
Examples include:
* Large mining machines, such as the Liebherr T 282B dump truck or LeTourneau L-2350 wheel loader.
*NASA&#x27;s Crawler-Transporters.
*Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid commercial truck.
*International DuraStar Hybrid diesel–electric truck.
*Dodge is conducting fleet tests of a diesel–electric version of the Dodge Sprinter.
*Peterbilt Supertruck 1 and 2.
*Hyllion Inc. is modifying some semi trucks to run on its 6X4HE Class 8 diesel electric hybrid system.
*Edison Motors is a Canadian company making electric and diesel electric semi trucks and pickup trucks.

===Concept vehicles===

In the automobile industry, diesel engines in combination with electric transmissions and battery power are being developed for future vehicle drive systems. Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles was a cooperative research program between the U.S. government and &quot;The Big Three&quot; automobile manufacturers (DaimlerChrysler, Ford and General Motors) that developed diesel hybrid cars.

*&quot;Third-Millennium Cruiser&quot;, an attempt to commercialize a diesel–electric automobile in the early 1980s.
*General Motors Precept
*Ford Prodigy
*Dodge Intrepid ESX
*Ford Reflex is a diesel hybrid concept car.
*Zytek developed a diesel hybrid powertrain.
*Peugeot 307 Hybrid HDi
*Citroën C-Cactus
*Opel Flextreme
*Top Gear Hammerhead Eagle i-Thrust
*Rivian Automotive was developing a diesel–electric engine that should achieve an estimated 90 miles per U.S. gallon (2.61 L/100 km) in the city and over 100 miles per U.S. gallon (2.35 L/100 km) on the highway.

===Military vehicles===
Diesel–electric propulsion has been tried on some military vehicles, such as tanks. The German armored vehicles VK 45.01 (P), Elefant, and Panzer VIII Maus of the Second World War were petrol-electric or diesel-electric propelled. The prototype TOG1 and TOG2 super heavy tanks of the Second World War used twin generators driven by V12 diesel engines. More recent prototypes include the SEP modular armoured vehicle and T95e. Future tanks may use diesel–electric drives to improve fuel efficiency while reducing the size, weight and noise of the power plant. Attempts with diesel–electric drives on wheeled military vehicles include the unsuccessful ACEC Cobra, MGV, and XM1219 armed robotic vehicle.
