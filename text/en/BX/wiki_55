<text>Álamos () is a town in Álamos Municipality in the Mexican state of Sonora, in northwestern Mexico.

Historically an important center of silver mining, the town&#x27;s economy is now dominated by the tourist sector. Designated a &quot;pueblo mágico&quot; due to its architecture, the town is host to several arts festivals, most notably the Festival Cultural &quot;Alfonso Ortíz Tirado&quot;. It also hosts the Alamos Alliance, a yearly summit of economic policy makers, academics and business leaders founded and led by Arnold Harberger that has led to the town being called the &quot;Little Mexican Davos&quot;.

==Name==
The Municipality of Álamos derives its name from the (poplar or cottonwood) tree. Several impressive specimens are found in one of its two principal plazas, the Alameda. The nearby hamlet, El Sabinito, located within the municipality, also derives its name from a tree, the (&quot;Montezuma cypress&quot;).

==History==
The area was named by the conquistador Francisco Vásquez de Coronado. His expedition of 1540 camped at the confluence of the two major arroyos (Escondido and the Aduana) of present-day Álamos and made reference to local geographical landmarks, including two large rock formations on Mount Alamos known as Los Frailes, &#x27;the monks&#x27; in English.

As historian David Leighton explained, “Its first known name was Real de los Frailes or “Mining Camp of the Friars,” a designation taken from some tall white rocks that appeared like hooded monks near the village.”

The church records of Álamos date to 1682, but it was founded on December 8, 1685, by the Spanish soldier, Domingo Terán de los Ríos, after the discovery of the silver mines at Promontorios, La Aduana, Las Cabras, La Quintera, and others of lesser importance nearby. Rios in 1686 became governor of Sonora and Sinaloa, where he was successful in quelling Indian disturbances.

A major expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza II departed Álamos in 1775 to discover a route to Alta California. The Anza expedition had nearly 300 members, of which about half were from Álamos. The trek was financed by the wealthy silver mine owners of Álamos, and it established the Presidio of Monterey.

Álamos became the capital of what was then the state of Occidental in the early 1800s. Occidental encompassed today&#x27;s state of Sonora, the northern portion of the state of Sinaloa, and some of Baja California and southern Arizona. Álamos was the northernmost “Silver City” in Mexico. While it has much in common, architecturally, with Mexico&#x27;s other “Silver Cities,” Álamos has not succumbed to large-scale commercialism and has managed to retain the charm and pace of earlier times.

Álamos is known as “La Ciudad de los Portales” (&quot;portales&quot; are tall, arched, covered verandas or walkways fronting many of the cobble-stoned streets or &quot;calles&quot;). Álamos boasts numerous buildings exhibiting classic Andalusian architecture from Mexico&#x27;s Colonial period, including numerous mansions, the Plaza de Armas, the Church of La Purísima Concepción, La Capilla and the Palacio Municipal (“city hall”).

The great wealth created by the silver mines from the surrounding mining towns of La Aduana, Minas Nuevas, and others enabled the founders and residents of Álamos to build scores of colonial Spanish mansions throughout the town; most of them went into ruin in the early 20th century but in the late 1940s, a number of Americans and Canadians began buying and restoring the houses. 

Most notably, William Levant Alcorn, an American farmer, bought one of the decaying mansions there, restored it and opened a hotel. The publicity he brought to Alamos breathed new life into this once prosperous city, which in turn attracted further investment in the years ahead.

By 1955, the city had electricity running from dusk to about midnight and in 1960 electrical power began to run 24 hours a day, being generated at a dam on a nearby river.

In the 1980s, a study was done by the students at the University of Sinaloa, which resulted in 185 structures in town being listed as historic monuments.

The Alamos Alliance was started in 1993 by Arnold Harberger as a small gathering among friends to discuss economic policy.

==Geography==
Álamos is located in the southeastern part of Sonora, and from state capital Hermosillo, from Navojoa via Sonora State Highway 162, and from the northern border town of Nogales. The State of Chihuahua is on the east, and the State of Sinaloa on the south. The population of the municipality is 24,493 and its area is .
===Climate===
Álamos has a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;) bordering on a tropical savanna climate, with three seasons: a hot, dry season from April to June, a hot, humid wet season from July to October, and a warm, generally dry “winter” from November to March. Occasionally the dry winter pattern is interrupted by the passage of frontal cloudbands: fell during January 1981, including between the fifth and the seventh of that month, and over in January 1979. During the hot early summer, temperatures can reach extreme heights; the record being on 16 June 1976.


==Economy==

After a heyday lasting from the late 1600s until the early 1900s, when the silver mines closed, the economy of Alamos went into a serious decline. Only a few hundred people remained in the once vibrant city due to a major decline in silver prices, ongoing unrest in the country with a revolution in progress, and the exodus of business owners and people of wealth. Vacant mansions went into disrepair until foreigners began restoring homes in 1946 after three decades of abandonment, bringing employment to locals with building and housekeeping skills. The area&#x27;s top industries for decades were ranching and tourism. The present-day economy includes copper and silver mines. About 16 km to the northwest is the Adolfo Ruiz Cortinez Dam and Reservoir known as “El Mocúzarit”, whose waters irrigate . Cattle ranching is seasonal and declining due to impoverished grazing lands. Numerous chicken and pig farms, called “granjas,” contribute substantially to the economy.

===Tourism===
Álamos was named a “Pueblo Mágico” in 2005. “Pueblo Magico” is a designation given by the Mexican Secretariat of Tourism to towns that offer a &#x27;magical&#x27; experience by reason of their natural beauty, cultural riches and historical relevance.

Álamos has many festivals and fiestas year-round. Most notable is the annual Festival of Dr. Alfonso Ortiz Tirado (“FAOT”), a nine-day event in late January that is attended by many national and international musicians and celebrities. Dr. Alfonso Ortiz Tirado, born in this community in 1894, achieved recognition for being “El Tenor de las Américas.” An impressive exhibit of Ortiz Tirado is found in the Museo Costumbrista, located in front of and to the east of the Plaza de Armas. The annual film festival is usually held in March. Several professional hunting lodges operate in the Alamos area, attracting dove hunters from various areas of the world. Álamos has more recently been the location for film production, including a European Endemol production and more than 180 episodes of the &#x27;novela&#x27; (soap opera) &quot;La Fuerza del Destino&quot;

The Sierra de Álamos–Río Cuchujaqui Biosphere Reserve offers serious “birding” opportunities. The creek of Cuchujaqui, which is in the ecological reserve is the most species-rich subtropical area in the Northern Hemisphere. Cuchujaqui is the subject of international scientific study and the southern migration destination of hundreds of different species of birds.

The presence of a jet-rated airport in Alamos (XALA) attracts aviators from Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. There is also charter service available to some areas of the Copper Canyon. The village has more than 20 hotels and B&amp;B&#x27;s.

<text>Sterling Allen Brown (May 1, 1901 – January 13, 1989) was an American professor, folklorist, poet, and literary critic. He chiefly studied black culture of the Southern United States and was a professor at Howard University for most of his career. Brown was the first Poet Laureate of the District of Columbia.

==Early life and education==
Brown was born May 1, 1901, on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C., where his father, Sterling N. Brown, a former slave, was a prominent minister and professor at Howard University Divinity School. His mother Grace Adelaide Brown, who had been the valedictorian of her class at Fisk University, taught in D.C. public schools for more than 50 years. Both his parents grew up in Tennessee and often shared stories with Brown and his sister Mary Edna Brown (a founder of Delta Sigma Theta sorority) about famous leaders such as Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington.

Brown&#x27;s early childhood was spent on a farm on Whiskey Bottom Road in Howard County, Maryland. He was educated at Waterford Oaks Elementary and Dunbar High School, where he graduated as the top student. He received a scholarship to attend Williams College in Massachusetts. Graduating from Williams Phi Beta Kappa in 1922, he continued his studies at Harvard University, receiving an MA in English a year later. That same year of 1923, he was hired as an English lecturer at Virginia Theological Seminary and College in Lynchburg, Virginia, a position he held for the next three years. He never pursued a doctorate degree, but several colleges gave him honorary doctorates. Brown won the Graves Prize for his essay &quot;The Comic Spirit in Shakespeare and Moliere&quot; during his senior year at Williams. Brown was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

==Marriage and family==
Brown married Daisy Turnbull in 1927 and they adopted a son, Johnathon L. Dennis. Daisy was an occasional muse for Brown; his poems &quot;Long Track Blues&quot; and &quot;Against That Day&quot; were inspired by her.

==Academic career==
Brown began his teaching career with positions at several universities, including Lincoln University and Fisk University, before returning to Howard in 1929. He was a professor there for 40 years. Brown&#x27;s poetry used the South for its setting and chronicled the experiences of enslaved African-American people. In his creative work, Brown often imitated southern African-American speech, using &quot;variant spellings and apostrophes to mark dropped consonants&quot;. He taught and wrote about African-American literature and folklore. He was a pioneer in the appreciation of this genre. He had an &quot;active, imaginative mind&quot; when writing and &quot;a natural gift for dialogue, description and narration&quot;.

Brown was known for introducing his students to concepts in jazz, which, along with blues, spirituals and other forms of black music, formed an integral component of his poetry. He was a speaker at the famous From Spirituals to Swing concerts, and his introduction can be heard on the recordings made of the performances.

In addition to his career at Howard University, Brown served as a visiting professor at Vassar College, New York University, Atlanta University, and Yale University. Some of his notable students include Toni Morrison, Kwame Ture ( Stokely Carmichael), Kwame Nkrumah, Thomas Sowell, Ossie Davis, and Amiri Baraka ( LeRoi Jones).

In 1969, Brown retired from his faculty position at Howard and turned full-time to poetry.

==Literary career==
In 1932, Brown published his first book of poetry &quot;Southern Road&quot;. It was a collection of poems, many with rural themes, and treated the simple lives of poor, black, country folk with poignancy and dignity. Brown&#x27;s work included pieces of authentic dialect and structures as well as formal work. Despite the success of this book, he struggled to find a publisher for the follow-up, &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;.

His poetic work was influenced in content, form and cadence by African-American music, including work songs, blues and jazz. Like that of Jean Toomer, Zora Neale Hurston, Langston Hughes and other black writers of the period, his work often dealt with race and class in the United States. He was deeply interested in a folk-based culture, which he considered most authentic. Brown is considered part of the Harlem Renaissance artistic tradition, although he spent the majority of his life in the Brookland neighborhood of Northeast Washington, D.C.

== Civil rights work ==
As a member of the fight for racial equality, Brown stuck to the belief that &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword.&quot; As a member of the NAACP, Brown served on the organization&#x27;s advisory board and worked with other notable Harlem Renaissance writers including W.E.B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, and Walter White.

In his work, Brown explores topics including the unethical restrictions of Jim Crow, the inferiority of public schools serving black communities, and the political and social activities of black churches. Working tirelessly in the fight for racial equality, Brown used his platform as a journalist to include his own personal commentaries that appealed to the conscience of white America in the face of a spreading democracy. One quote from Brown exemplifies his stance in the fight for racial equality: &quot;If America is to indoctrinate the rest of the world with democracy, it is logical to expect that the American Negro will share it at home.… [S]egregation must be abolished before there will be true democracy at home.&quot;

==Honors==
In 1979, the District of Columbia declared May 1, his birthday, &quot;Sterling A. Brown Day&quot;.

His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize in the early 1980s for the best collection of poetry published that year.

In 1982, the City College of New York, awarded him the Langston Hughes Medal

In 1984, the District of Columbia named him its first poet laureate, a position he held until his death from leukemia at the age of 88.

The Friends of Libraries USA in 1997 named Founders Hall at Howard University a Literary Landmark, the first so designated in Washington, DC.

The home where Brown resided is located in the Brookland section of Northeast Washington, DC. An engraved plaque and a sign created by the DC Commission on the Arts and Humanities are featured in front of the house.

<text>East Godavari is a district in the Coastal Andhra region of Andhra Pradesh, India. Its district headquarters is at Rajamahendravaram.

==Geography==

This district is surrounded by:
* North East: Alluri Sitharama Raju district
* North West: Eluru district
* South: Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Konaseema district
* South East: Kakinada district
* South West: West Godavari district.

== History ==
=== Early kingdoms ===

The district, like the rest of the Deccan, was under the Nandas and Mauryas in its early history. After the fall of the Mauryan Empire, the district was under the Satavahanas until the 3rd century under the famous poet king Haala. Coins found during excavations have revealed the rule of Gautamiputra Satakarni, Vaasisthi-puttra Pulumaavi and Yajna Sri Satakarni. Gupta emperor Samudragupta invaded during the rule of both Pishtapura and Avamukta in the district in 350 AD Samudragupta&#x27;s invasion was followed by the rule of the Mathara dynasty from 375 to 500. The earliest known ruler of the dynasty was Saktivarman.

The district passed into the hands of Vishnukundinas during the rule of Vikramendra Varma I during the 5th century. The records indicate that their domain extended over Visakhapatnam, West Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts in addition to East Godavari. Indra Bhattaraka defeated the rulers of Vasistha Kula and re-established Vihsnukundina authority, but was shortly defeated by Kalinga armies. Indra Bhattaraka was followed to the throne by a few others, including Madhava Varma III and Manchana Bhattaraka, who tried to restore their kingdom. Madhava Varma III was the last important ruler of this family.

=== Chalukyas and Cholas ===

The Pulakesi II of Badami Chalukyas and his brother Kubja Vishnu Vardhana acquired Pishtapura in the 7th century. The Eastern Chalukya dynasty, founded by Kubja Vishnu Vardhana, ruled at first form Pishtapura, then from Vengi, and later from Rajamahendravaram. Many rulers held sway over the kingdom and their history is at times largely a record of disputes over succession. Chalukya Bhima I of this dynasty built a Shiva temple at Draksha Ramam. Jata Choda Bhima of PedaKallu (Kurnool District) killed Daanaarnava of this dynasty and occupied Vengi in 973 AD Daanaarnava&#x27;s two sons, Sakti Varma I and Vimala Aditya, fled from the kingdom and took refuge in the court of the Chola king Rajaraja Chola I. Rajaraja invaded Vengi on behalf of the sons of Daanaarnava and killed Jata Choda Bhima. Satya Raya of the Western Chalukyas of Kalyani did not like the Chola influence in Vengi and the area witnessed many wars between the Cholas and Chalukyas. After the death of Vijaya Aditya VII in 175 AD, the Eastern Chalukya dynasty came to an end.

Kulottunga Chola I (Rajendra Chalukya), a rival of Vijay Aditya VII, fought along the sides of Cholas and established the Chalukya Cholas province. The district along with the rest of the Vengi kingdom became part of their empire. Major portions of the district were under Velanati Chodas, trustworthy chieftains to his. Rulers of this dynasty included Gonka I, Rajendra Choda I, Gonka II and Rajendra Choda II. Vikram Aditya vii of Western Chalukyas occupied this region for a short period, but it was recovered by Chalukya Cholas and Velanati Chodas. Velanati chiefs also suppressed rebellions from Haihayas of Kona, Gonka II and Rudra of the Kakatiya dynasty.

=== Kakatiyas and Delhi Sultanate ===

Inscriptions at this region including the ones at Draksha Ramam in 13th-century throw light on their history. Prola II of the Kakatiya dynasty declared independence from the western Chalukyas and became a subject of Chalukya Cholas. His son Rudra obtained the Godavari delta as a gift from the Rajaraja II of Chalukya Cholas. Rudra&#x27;s authority over the Godavari delta was challenged by the Velanadu Chodas. The Velanati king Rajendra Choda II sent an army under his minister Davana Preggada against Rudra. Rudra was succeeded by his younger brother Mahadeva who died in a conflict with the Yadavas of Devagiri. His son Ganapati succeeded to the Kakatiya throne. Ganapati defeated Kalinga armies on the north, Pandyas of Madura and Cholas with the help of Nellooru Chodas. The Kakatiya power remained undisturbed in the Godavari region throughout the reign of Ganapati and her daughter Rudrama devi. Pratapa Rudra ascended the throne in 1295 and faced many attacks from Sultans of Delhi. After his defeat by Muhammad bin Tughluq in 1323, the district came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate. Muhammad-bin-Tughluq divided South India into five provinces and appointed governors.

=== Nayakas, Reddi, Telagas (Kapus) and other kingdoms ===

Delhi sultans faced rebellions from the confederacy of local chiefs under the authority of Prolaya of the Musunuri Nayaks clan. The Reddis of Addanki, Koppula Telagas of Pithapuram and the Recharla Velamas of Rachakonda actively helped him. Warangal was liberated and Telugu land enjoyed freedom for fifty years. Musunuri Kapaya Nayaka appointed his relatives Toyyeti Anavota Nayaka and Mummadi Nayaka (Korukonda) as governors in Godavari region. Mummadi Nayaka married the niece of Kapaya Nayaka. Mummadi Nayaka lived until 1388. He had three sons who ruled for a period of 40 years and later they were reduced to submission by the Reddis of Kondaveedu and their principality was merged in the kingdom of Kondaveedu. Subsequently, Narasimha Deva IV of Kalinga succeeded in conquering this region, but was repulsed by Anavota Reddi of Rajamahendravaram. He was succeeded by Anavema Reddi and Kumaragiri of the same dynasty.

Kumaragiri fought many wars with the Recharlas of Rachakonda and the Kalinga rulers. He sent his general Kataya Vema along with Prince Anavota to conquer the eastern region. This resulted in the annexation of a large tract in the north as far as Simhachalam. The newly acquired territory was annexed to the Reddi Kingdom and constituted into a separate province called the eastern kingdom. Prince Anavota ruled this province with Raja-Mahendra-Varam as his capital. He died a premature death around 1395 and Kataya Vema, the general and brother-in-law of Kumara Giri, was given Raja Mahendra Rajya in appreciation of the services rendered by him to the State. Kataya Vema&#x27;s departure to Raja Mahendra Varam led to the seizure of the throne of Kondaveedu by force by Peda Komati Vema.

Peda Komati Vema&#x27;s authority was defined by Kataya Vema. Kataya Vema was also involved in a conflict with Eruva chief Annadeva Choda, who managed to occupy a large portion of the Raja Mahendra Rajya. He was, however, defeated and driven back by Kataya Vema. Later, Kataya Vema died in a battle with Anna Deva Choda. After his death, Allada Reddi placed Kataya Vemas&#x27; son Komaragiri on the throne of Rajamahendravaram and ruled the kingdom as his regent. Komarigiri died a premature death. Allada Reddi ruled this region until his death in 1420. About 1423, the Vijayanagara ruler Deva Raya II defeated Veera Bhadra, who was then ruling this kingdom and reduced it to subjection.

After the death of Kapilendra Deva Gajapati in 1466, there was a fight between his sons Hamveera Deva and Purushottama Deva for succession. Hamveera succeeded in occupying the throne with the help of Bahmanis but he could not retain it for long. Purushottama overthrew Hamveera and tried to reconquer Rajamahendravaram and other places. But Muhammad Shah III led the forces to Rajamahendravaram. This battle, however, ended with the conclusion of a peace treaty. After the death of Muhammad Shah III, Purushottama Gajapati overran the whole of the Godavari-Krishna do-ab and drove the Bahmani forces as far south as Kondaveedu. Purushottama was succeeded by his son Pratapa Rudra. The Vijayanagar monarch Krishnadevaraya invaded his kingdom and brought Rajamahendravaram under subjugation. However, a treaty was concluded wherein Pratapa Rudra agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Krishna Deva Raya in return of the territory north of the Krishna conquered by Krishna Deva Raya.

=== Muslim kingdoms ===
Taking advantage of the disturbed conditions, the Qutab Shahi ruler of Golkonda, Sultan Quli Qutab Shah, invaded the coastal region and took possession of Rajamahendravaram and the neighboring kingdoms. Sultan Quli was murdered and he was succeeded to the throne by his son Jamshid Qutab Shah and then by his grandson Subhan Qutab Shah. During his reign, Ibrahim Qutab Shah had to ward off challenges from Shitab Khan and Vidyadhar. The last ruler of this dynasty was Abdul Hasan Tana Shah, who ruled from 1672 to 1687.

Aurangzeb conquered the sultanate of Golaconda in 1687, and Golaconda, including East Godavari, became one of the twenty-two provinces of the Mughal Empire. The Nizam-ul-Mulk (viceroy of Golaconda) looked after the administration through military officers called Fauzdars. Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju, the new Raja of Vizianagaram, invited the French to occupy the Northern Circars. The tussle that ensued between the French and the English ended with the French losing all possessions in Northern Circars except Yanam.

Salabat Jung was subsequently deposed by his brother Nizam Ali Khan, who leased out Rajamahendravaram and Chicacole to Hasan Ali Khan. Lord Robert Clive, entered into negotiations with the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam and obtained a &quot;firmana&quot; ceding the Northern Circars to the British East India Company in August 1765, but it was kept a secret until March 1766. The fort of Kondapalli was seized by the British, and General Cillaud was sent to Machilipatnam to undertake military operations, if necessary. The Nizam also made brisk preparations for war. War was prevented by the signing of a treaty on 12 November 1766 by which the company, in return for occupying the Circars, undertook to maintain troops for the Nizam&#x27;s assistance.

=== British rule (1768–1947) ===

By a second treaty, signed on 1 March 1768 the Nizam acknowledged the validity of Shah Alam&#x27;s grant and resigned the Circars to the company, receiving as a mark of friendship an annuity of 50,000. Finally, in 1823, the claims of the Nizam over the Northern Circars were bought outright by the company, and they became a British possession. 

In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajamahendravaram was created in 1823. It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajamahendravaram was the headquarters of Godavari District, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was divided, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became headquarters of West Godavari.

In 1839 during the British Raj, a colossal cyclone struck Coringa and toppled buildings, therefore over 300,000 people were killed.

=== Post-independence ===

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the former Madras Presidency of British India became India&#x27;s Madras State. In 1953, the northern districts of Madras state, including the Godavari district, became the new state of Andhra. Yanam was relinquished by the French in 1954, but one condition of the cession treaty was the retention of the district&#x27;s separate and distinct identity, which also applied to the other South Indian enclaves constituting today&#x27;s Puducherry state.

In November 1956, Andhra Pradesh was formed by merging Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking areas of the Hyderabad State. In 1959, the Bhadrachalam revenue division, consisting of Bhadrachalam and Naguru Taluqas (2 Taluqas in 1959 but later subdivided into Wajedu, Venkatapruram, Charla, Dummugudem, Bhadrachalam, Nellipaka, Chinturu, Kunavaram, and Vara Rama Chandra Puram Mandals) of the East Godavari district were merged into the Khammam district. After June 2014&#x27;s reorganisation and division of Andhra Pradesh, only the mandals of Bhadrachalam (with the exception of Bhadrachalam Temple), Nellipaka, Chinturu, Kunavaram and Vara Rama Chandra Puram were re-added back to the East Godavari district.

<text>Navojoa is the fifth-largest city in the northern Mexican state of Sonora and is situated in the southern part of the state. The city is the administrative seat of Navojoa Municipality, located in the Mayo River Valley.

==History==
The city name derives from the native Mayo language meaning &quot;cactus-house&quot; (Navo&quot;= Cactus, &quot;Jova&quot;= House). The valley has been continuously inhabited since pre-Hispanic times by the Mayo people.
In September 1536, Diego de Guzmán, a Spaniard, became the first known European to reach the valley. The first Jesuit missionaries started settling in the region in 1614, founding Mission Santa Catalina Camoa. Several geoglyphs from the Mayo tribe can be found along the Mayo River.

Due to the city&#x27;s distant location from Mexico City, the difficult times of Mexico&#x27;s independence in the early 19th century were largely absent from the region. However, the city had some importance after the Mexican Revolution of 1910. The Mexican Revolutionary Álvaro Obregón was born in Hacienda Siquisiva, a small town near Navojoa. Álvaro Obregón became president of Mexico after the revolt and initiated an in the Mayo/Yaqui Valley, introducing modern agricultural techniques and making this valley one of the most prosperous agricultural regions in Mexico.

==Economy==
Navojoa is part of the large economic center known as the Mayo Valley, which together with Ciudad Obregón and the Yaqui Valley, form one of the most productive agricultural regions in Mexico.

Although agriculture remains the main source of income, the Navojoa region is increasingly dependent on industrial foreign investment and aquaculture, especially shrimp farming.

Two large swine production companies that export mainly to the United States, Germany and Japan, a recycled containerboard mill and box factory privately owned by Sonoran investors, as well as one brewery belonging to the FEMSA group (recently acquired from Heineken), are among the main industries in Navojoa.

The city gains importance through its geographic diversity featuring close access to coastal, desert, and southwest mountainous areas as well as its close proximity to the United States and the neighboring state of Sinaloa. Navojoa is south of Ciudad Obregón connected primarily by a toll highway (Mex. 15) that extends north across the state of Sonora to the Arizona border.
==Transportation==

===Airports===
Ciudad Obregón International Airport (CEN) is the nearest commercial airport, north of Navojoa. It receives flights from Guadalajara, Hermosillo, La Paz, Loreto, Los Cabos, Mexico City, Monterrey, and, internationally, from Los Angeles, Tucson, Phoenix and Houston in the United States. Airlines serving this airport include Aeromexico, AeroCalafia, Interjet, Volaris and low-cost airline VivaAerobus.

Alternate Airports to CEN are Hermosillo Intl. Airport (IATA: HMO) and in a lower sense Los Mochis (IATA: LMM). HMO also receives low cost airlines&#x27; flights incoming from the main cities of the Republic such as: Mexico City, Guadalajara, Querétaro, Monterrey, Tijuana, Puebla among others.

Navojoa also has a local airport (see: Navojoa Airport) next to the industrial sector, which is suitable for light private planes. It is about south of the city center.

===Buses===
Several companies offer low, mid and luxury class bus services from Navojoa to the Mexican Republic and international destinations such as Tucson, Phoenix and Los Angeles in the US. Connections are offered by foreign partner companies to other USA and Canada destinations. A bus station was built in the north of the city; however it is not used and small stations in the city center are used instead.

Old public city buses have been replaced with new models with air conditioning, called SUBA. They run every few minutes and provide simple and cheap transport.

===Railroad===
A north-south freight-only railroad is in operation, connecting to the Mexican border in Nogales and to Guadalajara, Jalisco.

===Highways===

The most important highway serving Navojoa is Mexican Federal Highway 15, a four-lane highway which connects it to north to Ciudad Obregón, Guaymas, Hermosillo, Nogales and the United States of America; and to the south to the states of Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco, Michoacán, State of Mexico and Mexico City.

The main state routes serving Navojoa are Sonora State Highway 149 and Sonora State Highway 162.

Also, the Periférico is a semi-beltway encompassing some of Navojoa&#x27;s southern and western neighborhoods and it is used as a truck route or bypass for Mexican Federal Highway 15.
It is enlarged from 2 to 4 lanes in the western section between Centenario Boulevard and Sosa Chávez Boulevard with the project ending in december of 2017.
===Others===
Although Navojoa&#x27;s streets are almost all paved, horse-drawn carts are still used by the residents of the small surrounding communities (San Ignacio Cohuirimpo, etc.). Horse carts are numerous enough that there is a parking lot reserved for them on Hidalgo Avenue near the City Market in central Navojoa.

===Museums===
The &quot;Museo Regional del Mayo&quot; (Mayo&#x27;s Regional Museum) is located in the former railroad station building opposite Santa Fe Springs square. The Museum has 5 rooms which exhibit temporary paint, handicraft and sculpture expositions, pre-Hispanic and colonial objects, ethnographic expositions dedicated to the Mayos&#x27; culture and other objects related to Navojoa&#x27;s history.

The Tehuelibampo Museum is an eco-museum with 89 petroglyphics carved in the stones over 500 years ago by the Mayo people. It is located next to the Mayo river, some kilometers north-west of Navojoa.

===Beaches===
The city is near the Gulf of California which offers a variety of beaches. The surrounding country is also popular for hunting ducks, doves and deer.

Las Bocas, 30 miles south of Navojoa, is a small beach community on the Gulf of California that is frequently visited by the local residents of Navojoa during spring. (April–May). It is particularly popular during &quot;Semana Santa&quot; (Holy Week), when campers stay for seven days and then return to Navojoa for Easter celebrations.

Many people from Navojoa own a second house in Las Bocas.

Although one of the closer beaches to Navojoa is located about one hour away in a small town called Huatabampo. The beach is named after the town, hence the name, &quot;Huatabampito&quot; where many families gather year long to enjoy the beauty of the ocean.

===Adolfo Ruiz Cortinez dam===
The Adolfo Ruiz Cortines Dam, also called Mocúzarit, is a popular fishing spot and stores water used for irrigating the valley via the Mayo River. Other uses include kayaking, water-skiing, geoglyph-viewing and other leisure activities.

===Others===
Navojoa also acts as a hub for those visiting the colonial town of Álamos, which is inland toward the mountains of the Sierra Madre.

==Climate==

Navojoa has a borderline semi-arid climate/desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSh/BWh&quot;) with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is scarce, but is more common during the summer months during the monsoon season.

<text>Arch Linux () is an open source, rolling release Linux distribution. Arch Linux is kept up-to-date by regularly updating the individual pieces of software that it comprises. Arch Linux is intentionally minimal, and is meant to be configured by the user during installation so they may add only what they require.

Arch Linux provides monthly &quot;snapshots&quot; which are used as installation media.

Pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, is used to install, remove and update software packages. An alternative is the Arch User Repository (AUR), which is the community-driven repository for Arch Linux; AUR packages can be downloaded and built, or installed through an AUR &#x27;helper&#x27;.

Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation in the form of a community-run wiki known as the ArchWiki.

== History ==
Inspired by CRUX, another minimalist distribution, Judd Vinet started the Arch Linux project in March 2002. The name was chosen because Vinet liked the word&#x27;s meaning of &quot;the principal,&quot; as in &quot;arch-enemy&quot;.

Originally only for 32-bit x86 CPUs, the first x86_64 installation ISO was released in April 2006.

Vinet led Arch Linux until 1 October 2007, when he stepped down due to lack of time, transferring control of the project to Aaron Griffin.

The migration to systemd as its init system started in August 2012, and it became the default on new installations in October 2012. It replaced the SysV-style init system, used since the distribution&#x27;s inception.

The end of i686 support was announced in January 2017, with the February 2017 ISO being the last one including i686 and making the architecture unsupported in November 2017. Since then, the community derivative Arch Linux 32 can be used for i686 hardware.

On 24 February 2020, Aaron Griffin announced that due to his limited involvement with the project, he would, after a voting period, transfer control of the project to Levente Polyak. This change also led to a new 2-year term period being added to the Project Leader position.

In March 2021, Arch Linux developers were thinking of porting Arch Linux packages to x86_64-v3, roughly correlating to the Intel Haswell era of processors.

In April 2021, Arch Linux installation images began including a guided installation script by default.

In late 2021, the Arch Linux developers released Pacman 6.0, which enabled parallel downloads.

In February 2022, the Arch Linux developers began offering debug packages.

In September 2024, Valve partnered with Arch Linux developers to support ongoing development efforts with the focus on build service infrastructure and secure signing enclave.

=== Repository security ===
Until Pacman version 4.0.0, Arch Linux&#x27;s package manager lacked support for signed packages. Packages and metadata were not verified for authenticity by Pacman during the download-install process. Without package authentication checking, tampered-with or malicious repository mirrors could compromise the integrity of a system. Pacman 4 allowed verification of the package database and packages, but it was disabled by default. In November 2011, package signing became mandatory for new package builds, and as of March 2012, every official package is signed. In June 2012, package signing verification became official and is now enabled by default in the installation process.

== Design and principles ==

Arch is largely based on binary packages. Packages target x86-64 microprocessors to assist performance on modern hardware. A ports/ebuild-like system is also provided for automated source compilation, known as the Arch build system.

Arch Linux focuses on simplicity of design, meaning that the main focus involves creating an environment that is straightforward and relatively easy for the user to understand directly, rather than providing polished point-and-click style management tools the package manager, for example, does not have an official graphical front-end. This is largely achieved by encouraging the use of succinctly commented, clean configuration files that are arranged for quick access and editing. This has earned it a reputation as a distribution for &quot;advanced users&quot; who are willing to use the command-line interface.

=== Logo ===
The current Arch Linux logo was designed by Thayer Williams in 2007 as part of a contest to replace the previous logo.

== Installation ==

The Arch Linux website supplies ISO images that may be burned to a CD or USB drive. Installation can be accomplished manually by following the instructions on the Arch Wiki, or automatically through the use of the included &quot;archinstall&quot; script. Another command line utility that comes bundled with the installation media, &quot;pacstrap&quot; may be used to install the base system. Installation of additional packages which are not part of the base system can be done with either pacstrap, Pacman after booting (or chrooting) into the new installation, or by specifying packages within the guided archinstall script.
An alternative to using CD or USB images for installation is to use the static version of the package manager Pacman, from within another Linux-based operating system. The user can mount their newly formatted drive partition, and use pacstrap (or Pacman with the appropriate command-line switch) to install base and additional packages with the mountpoint of the destination device as the root for its operations. This method is useful when installing Arch Linux onto USB flash drives, or onto a temporarily mounted device which belongs to another system.

Depending on the selected installation type, further actions may need to be taken before the new system is ready for use. Notable configuration includes the installation of a bootloader, configuring the system with a hostname, network connection, language settings, and graphical user interface.

Arch Linux does not schedule releases for specific dates, nor does it provide traditional releases, but instead uses a rolling release model. Packages in the main repositories are updated often, with new updates being pushed far quicker when compared to LTS distributions. This style of package management allows users to easily keep systems updated.

Occasionally, manual interventions are required for certain updates, with instructions posted on the news section of the Arch Linux website.
==Package management==

===pacman===

All packages are managed through pacman, a package manager written specifically for Arch Linux. Pacman handles package installation, upgrades, downgrades, removal and features automatic dependency resolution. The packages for Arch Linux are obtained from the Arch Linux package tree and are compiled for the x86-64 architecture.

Pacman typically uses binary packages with a codice_1 extension (for zstd compression), with codice_2 placed before this to indicate that it is a Pacman package (giving codice_3);
though other compression formats are also valid, such as codice_4.

Packages can be installed via codice_5, and codice_6 can be used to perform a full system upgrade.

As well as Arch Linux, Pacman is also used for installing packages under MSYS2 (a fork of Cygwin) on Windows.

===Repositories===
The following official binary repositories exist:
*&quot;core&quot;, which contains all the packages needed to set up a base system. Packages in this repository include kernel packages and shell languages. 
*&quot;extra&quot;, which holds packages not required for the base system, including desktop environments and programs. 
*&quot;multilib&quot;, a centralized repository for x86-64 users to more readily support 32-bit applications in a 64-bit environment. Packages in this repository include Steam and Wine. 
Additionally, there are &quot;testing&quot; repositories which include binary package candidates for other repositories. Currently, the following testing repositories exist:
*&quot;core-testing&quot;, with packages for &quot;core&quot;.
*&quot;extra-testing&quot;, with packages for &quot;extra&quot;.
*&quot;multilib-testing&quot;, with packages for &quot;multilib&quot;.
The &quot;core-staging&quot; and &quot;extra-staging&quot; repositories are used for some rebuilds to avoid broken packages in &quot;testing&quot;. The developers recommend not using these repositories for any reason, stating that any system updating from them will &quot;unquestionably break.&quot;

There are also two other repositories that include the newest version of certain desktop environments.
*&quot;gnome-unstable&quot;, which contains packages of a new version of the software from GNOME before being released into &quot;testing&quot;.
*&quot;kde-unstable&quot;, which contains packages of a new version of KDE software before being released into &quot;testing.&quot;
The &quot;unstable&quot; repository was dropped in July 2008 and most of the packages moved to other repositories. The &quot;community&quot; repository was merged with &quot;extra&quot; in May 2023. In addition to the official repositories, there are a number of unofficial user repositories.

The most well-known unofficial repository is the Arch User Repository, or AUR, hosted on the Arch Linux site. The AUR does not host binary packages but instead a collection of build scripts known as PKGBUILDs. PKGBUILD scripts are executed by the codice_7 command, which downloads the necessary files from the software&#x27;s repository and builds them using the Arch build system.

The Arch Linux repositories contain both libre and nonfree software, and the default Arch Linux kernel contains nonfree proprietary blobs, hence the distribution is not endorsed by the GNU project. The linux-libre kernel can be installed from the AUR or by enabling Parabola&#x27;s repositories.

===Arch build system (ABS)===
The Arch build system (ABS) is a ports-like source packaging system that compiles source tarballs into binary packages, which are installed via Pacman. The Arch build system provides a directory tree of shell scripts, called &quot;PKGBUILDs&quot;, that enable any and all official Arch packages to be customized and compiled. Rebuilding the entire system using modified compiler flags is also supported by the Arch build system. The Arch build system codice_7 tool can be used to create custom codice_9 packages from third-party sources. The resulting packages are also installable and trackable via Pacman.

===Arch User Repository (AUR)===
In addition to the repositories, the Arch User Repository (AUR) provides user-made PKGBUILD scripts for packages not included within the main repositories. These PKGBUILD scripts simplify building from source by explicitly listing and checking for dependencies and configuring the install to match the Arch architecture. Arch User Repository helper programs can further streamline the downloading of PKGBUILD scripts and associated building process. However, this comes at the cost of executing PKGBUILDs not validated by a trusted person; as a result, Arch developers have stated that the utilities for automatic finding, downloading and executing of PKGBUILDs will never be included in the official repositories.

Users can create packages compatible with Pacman using the Arch build system and custom PKGBUILD scripts. This functionality has helped support the Arch User Repository, which consists of user contributed packages to supplement the official repositories.

The Arch User Repository provides the community with packages that are not included in the main repositories. Reasons for exclusion from the main repositories include:
*Licensing issues: software that cannot be redistributed, but is free to use, can be included in the Arch User Repository since all that is hosted by the Arch Linux website is a shell script that downloads the actual software from elsewhere. Examples include proprietary freeware such as Google Earth and Spotify.
*Modified official packages: the Arch User Repository also contains many variations on the official packaging as well as beta versions of software that is contained within the repositories as stable releases.
*Popularity of the software: rarely used programs have not been added to the official repositories (yet).
*Betas or &quot;nightly&quot; versions of software which are very new and thus unstable. Examples include the &quot;firefox-nightly&quot; package, which gives new daily builds of the Firefox web browser.

PKGBUILDs for any software can be contributed by ordinary users. Any PKGBUILD that has 10 or more votes or more than 1% usage from pkgstats can be promoted into the &quot;extra&quot; repository.

===Reproducible builds===
Arch Linux is working on making all official packages reproducible. This means that when a package is rebuilt in a different environment it should be bit-by-bit identical. This allows users and researchers to verify the integrity of the packages found in the official repository. The status of this effort can be monitored on the dedicated status page.

== Derivatives ==
The Arch Linux wiki maintains its own list of Arch-based distributions.

There are several projects working on porting the Arch Linux ideas and tools to other kernels, including PacBSD (formerly ArchBSD) and Arch Hurd, which are based on the FreeBSD and GNU Hurd kernels, respectively. There is also the Arch Linux ARM project, which aims to port Arch Linux to ARM-based devices, including the Raspberry Pi, as well as the Arch Linux 32 project, which continued support for systems with 32-bit only CPUs after the mainline Arch Linux project dropped support for the architecture in November 2017.

SteamOS 3.0, the version of SteamOS used in the Steam Deck by Valve, is based on Arch Linux.

== Reception ==
OSNews reviewed Arch Linux in 2002. OSNews also has five later reviews about Arch Linux.

LWN.net wrote a review about Arch Linux in 2005. LWN.net also has two later reviews about Arch Linux.

Tux Machines reviewed Arch Linux in 2007.

Chris Smart from DistroWatch Weekly wrote a review about Arch Linux in January 2009. DistroWatch Weekly reviewed Arch Linux again in September 2009 and in December 2015.

The Linux kernel developer and maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman (GKH) has stated that he uses Arch Linux and that it &quot;works really really well&quot;. He has also praised the Arch Wiki, the distribution&#x27;s rolling release model, and the feedback loop with the community.

In a 2023 DistroWatch poll, about half of the responders maintained that they were running either Arch (17%) or an Arch derivative (30%). As of 2023, Arch also enjoys the highest average rating of any Linux distribution on DistroWatch with a rating of 9.34.

<text>Sir Boyle Roche, 1st Baronet (October 1736 – 5 June 1807) was an Irish politician. After a distinguished career in North America with the British Army, Roche became a member of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than for his politics – they were riddled with mixed metaphors (&quot;Mr Speaker, I smell a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I&#x27;ll nip him in the bud&quot;), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase (&quot;Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?&quot;). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s model for Mrs Malaprop.
While arguing for a bill, Roche once said, &quot;It would surely be better, Mr. Speaker, to give up not only a &quot;part&quot;, but, if necessary, even the &quot;whole&quot;, of our constitution, to preserve the &quot;remainder&quot;!&quot;

While these Irish bulls have led many writers to portray Roche as a buffoon, other biographers have interpreted them not as blunders, but as calculated attempts to disarm opposition to ministerial policies through humour. Roche ended his political career with the passage of the Act of Union 1800, which he supported. He chose not to attempt to enter the British House of Commons and retired on a government pension until his death, married but childless, in 1807.

==Life==

===Early life, family background and military service===

Boyle Roche was born, the youngest of three sons, to Jordan Roche and Ellen White in County Galway in 1736. His was an old and respectable Protestant family, said to be a junior branch of the ancient baronial house of Roche, Viscount Fermoy from which Diana, Princess of Wales, descended. The family were also no strangers to politics: Roche&#x27;s great-grandfather had been elected mayor of Limerick four times. Roche&#x27;s older brother was Tiger Roche, a celebrated duellist and adventurer.

Boyle Roche entered the army at an early age, and served in the so-called American war (that is, the American portion of the Seven Years&#x27; War). There are reports of a Lieutenant Boyle Roche in Rogers&#x27; Rangers who was captured by the French during The Battle on Snowshoes (near what is now Lake George, New York in March 1758) and later returned to his regiment. It is possible that Roche served with Wolfe at the Siege of Quebec in 1759; it is a certainty that he distinguished himself in 1762 during the capture of El Morro in Havana. By 1770 he had become a major in the 28th Foot. He was knighted for his bravery at El Morro in 1776.

Retiring from the army, he obtained an office in the Irish revenue department in 1775. In the same year, Boyle Roche entered the Irish House of Commons as
Member of Parliament (MP) for Tralee, a seat he held until 1776.

Although he was one of the first volunteers to fight the rebellious colonials in 1776, his contribution to that conflict was mainly in the area of recruitment—he successfully enlisted 500 volunteers in one weekend in Limerick alone, a feat which so gratified Lord Kenmare that he paid Roche an additional bounty of half a guinea per man. Roche&#x27;s flamboyant recruiting methods were described by the &quot;Edinburgh Advertiser&quot; as follows:

Yesterday Major BOYLE Roche, representative in parliament for Tralee (who is raising a body of men for his Majesty&#x27;s service) began recruiting here, and met with great success, which is not surprising, if we consider his connexions, and the uncommon support he has received from the noblemen and gentlemen of this province. His method of enlisting was as uncommon as it was pleasing to those who viewed the procession, which was as follows: Major Roche, bearing a large purse of gold. Captain Cowley. A great number of likely recruits. An elegant band of music, consisting of French horns, hautboys [oboes], clarionets, and bassoons, playing God Save the King. A large brewer&#x27;s dray, with five-barrels of beer, the horse richly caparisoned and ornamented with ribbands. Two draymen with cockades to serve the beer, The recruiting serjeant. Drums [and] fifes. Another division of recruits. The returning soldiers. Prodigious concourse of [spectators?]. The following speech was made by Major Roche to the populace: Being appointed, through the favour of [our] most excellent governor, to raise a body of men for the service of his Majesty, I think it [a] most happy circumstance of my life to be the instrument of leading you to honour and renown. The laurels fought for and obtained in all parts [of] the globe [through] war, have procured us a fame so glorious as not to be equalled by people in any fame not to be sullied by the assaults of prejudice, nor the effects of time: not an action in which we were not victorious, not a siege in which we were not honoured. Will you, my dear countrymen, permit those laurels to fade, or those actions to be forgotten? No, forbid it, heaven! Let us now that we have it in our power convey to later posterity a renewal of our fidelity, and a confirmation of our loyalty. A more critical period never presented itself, nor had we ever a fairer opportunity of shewing our attachment to the illustrious house of Hanover, than the present, as his Majesty&#x27;s deluded subjects in America are in open rebellion, and like unnatural children, wound their ever indulgent parent, forgetting the torrents of blood spilt, and heap of treasure expended for their preservation. His Sacred Majesty now calls and our fidelity obliges us, and I hope your instinct prompts you, to obey the dictates of so [grand] a master. Let us then, my brave and loyal countrymen, join hearts and hands and cheerfully step forth in the glorious cause of our Creator, our King and our Country.

In Dublin, Roche was a member of the Kildare Street Club.
===Member of Parliament===
Roche continued on in the Grattan Parliament, representing Gowran from 1777 to 1783, Portarlington from 1784 to 1790, Tralee (again) from 1790 to 1798 and Old Leighlin from 1798 until the union with Great Britain in 1801. From the beginning of his parliamentary career Roche ranged himself on the side of the government, and for his services he was granted a pension, appointed chamberlain to the viceregal court, and on 30 November 1782 was created a baronet. For the office of chamberlain he was thought to be &quot;eminently qualified by his handsome figure, graceful address and ready wit, qualities which were set off by a frank, open and manly disposition.&quot;

It was during this period (in 1782) that Roche coined the term &quot;Protestant Ascendancy&quot;.

Apparently, members of the cabinet wrote speeches for Sir Boyle which he somewhat imperfectly committed to memory, in general mastering the substance but frequently producing, through his love of language and ornament, travesties on the original words. Through this he gained his lasting reputation as an inveterate perpetrator of Irish bulls.

Boyle&#x27;s memory was indeed excellent. On one occasion he illustrated both the accuracy of his memory and the audacity of his character at the expense of a brother member. Edmond Stanley, anxious to produce an effect in an important debate, had been at pains to reduce his speech to writing. Unluckily, Stanley happened to drop his manuscript in the coffee-room, and walked back into the House unconscious of his loss. Sir Boyle, finding the document, speedily mastered its contents, and, rising at the first opportunity, delivered the speech almost verbatim in the hearing of its dismayed and astonished author. His apology afterward only added insult to injury:

On another occasion, he amused and relieved the House, irritated by the prospect of being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution, by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business in a few minutes.

Beyond these efforts, he was also the author of a bill to enact, among other things, that &quot;Every quart bottle should contain a quart.&quot;

===The Volunteer Convention===
The chief service Boyle Roche rendered his government was in connection with the Volunteer Convention of November 1783, in which he &quot;acted a part only less remarkable than his immunity from the opprobrium which might have been expected to attach to it.&quot;
The question of admitting the Roman Catholics to the franchise was at the time being agitated, and found many warm supporters in the convention. The proposal was extremely obnoxious to the Irish government, and on the second day of the meeting the secretary of state, George Ogle, announced that the Roman Catholics, in the person of Lord Kenmare, had relinquished the idea of making any claim further than the religious liberty they then enjoyed, and gave as his authority for this extraordinary statement Sir Boyle Roche, by whom it was confirmed!

Ten days later Lord Kenmare (who had not been in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least authority to any person to make any such statement in his name. However, his disavowal came too late: the anti-Catholic party in the convention had found time to organize themselves, and when the intended Reform Bill took shape it was known that the admission of Roman Catholics to the franchise was not to form part of the scheme.

Several months later (on Valentine&#x27;s Day), Sir Boyle explained himself in a public letter, starting with a description of his alarm upon hearing that the bishop of Derry (then Frederick Hervey) and his associates were bent on extending the legislative privilege:
I thought a crisis was arrived in which Lord Kenmare and the heads of that body should step forth to disavow those wilde projects, and to profess their attachment to the lawful powers. Unfortunately, his lordship was at a great distance, and most of my other friends were out of the way. I therefore resolved on a bold stroke, and authorized only by the sentiments of the persons in question, [took action].
He added that while he regretted that his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his manoeuvre had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who was related to Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare&#x27;s true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, but in a way that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.

Sir Boyle fought hard for the Union:
Gentlemen may tither, and tither, and tither, and may think it a bad measure; but their heads at present are hot, and will so remain till they grow cool again, and so they can&#x27;t decide right now, but when the day of judgement comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union.
For himself, he declared that his love for England and Ireland was so great that he &quot;would have the two sisters embrace like one brother.&quot;

===His life in politics===
Those who placidly accept the judgement that Boyle Roche was &quot;the Fool of the Grattan Parliament&quot; should reflect on the fact that for almost 25 years he served as Gentleman Usher and Master of Ceremonies to the Irish Court, &quot;an office for which a dignified and decorous demeanor is among the chief essentials.&quot;

Roche was also capable of humour which was both subtle and unquestionably intentional. Once, upon hearing his opponent John Philpot Curran expostulate that he could be &quot;the guardian of his own honour&quot;, Sir Boyle offered his &quot;congratulations to the honourable member on his possession of a sinecure.&quot; On another occasion, when the Opposition tried to cough him down in a debate, Sir Boyle met the interruption by producing some bullets, with the observation &quot;I have here some excellent pills to cure a cough.&quot; His personal courage being beyond dispute, this jest was quite sufficient in those duelling days to procure attention for the remainder of his speech.

===Marriage, retirement and death===
On 20 October 1778, Boyle Roche married Mary Frankland of Great Thirkleby Hall, near Thirsk, Yorkshire, daughter of Admiral Sir Thomas Frankland, Bt, whose family name goes back to the time of William the Conqueror. Although childless, Boyle and Lady Mary appeared to have lived a life of uninterrupted happiness.

After the Union and the dissolution of the Irish Parliament, Boyle received a £400 pension, and in addition £300 annually in his capacity as &quot;Surveyor of Kenmare River,&quot; a post which had been invented as a reward and required no work. Thus provided for, he was able to spend the rest of his days in comfort.

Boyle Roche died at his house in 63 Eccles Street, Dublin, on 5 June 1807, and was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Dublin, on 9 June. Mary lived on until 1831.

==Boyle Roche&#x27;s bird==
Roche is perhaps best known for once excusing an absence in Parliament thus: &quot;Mr. Speaker, it is impossible I could have been in two places at once, unless I were a bird.&quot; This quotation was referenced by Ambrose Bierce in &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in his definition of &quot;ubiquity&quot;:

In recent times ubiquity has not always been understood—not even by Sir Boyle Roche, for example, who held that a man cannot be in two places at once unless he is a bird.

But Roche was not uttering a malapropism here, he was quoting, and quoting correctly. The line appears in Jevon&#x27;s play, &quot;The Devil of a Wife&quot;, as follows:

:Wife: I cannot be in two places at once.

:Husband (Rowland): Surely no, unless thou wert a bird.

==Early life==
Ashley Suzanne Johnson was born in Camarillo, California, on August 9, 1983, the daughter of former test pilot Nancy (née Spruiell) and exploration ship captain Cliff Johnson. She has an older brother named Chris and an older sister named Haylie, both of whom have also worked as actors. Her sister later married singer and musician Jonny Lang. Her father was often away for months at a time and would bring back souvenirs from countries such as Japan. He started a new job nine days after Johnson was born and subsequently moved the family to Franklin, Michigan, where they lived for a few years before returning to California and settling in Los Angeles. Johnson attended school in nearby Burbank when her acting career allowed but otherwise had an on-set teacher. She later studied violin and piano at the International School of Music in Glendale. When she was 16, her father died of complications from hepatitis C and cancer of the liver and lungs. Johnson needed a back brace for three years due to scoliosis and kyphosis, which affected her during her high school years.

==Career==
Johnson&#x27;s career began at age six, when she played the role of Chrissy Seaver on the sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot; from 1990 to 1992. The character&#x27;s age was accelerated from a toddler between seasons for plotting purposes. By the time she was 12, Johnson had been in the casts of eight television series. She later reprised her role as Chrissy in &quot;The Growing Pains Movie&quot; and &quot;Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers&quot;. In the one season series &quot;Phenom&quot; (1993–94), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star. She appeared in the 1994 sitcom &quot;All-American Girl&quot;, which also lasted for only one season. She played DJ&#x27;s overbearing girlfriend Lisa in the &quot;Roseanne&quot; episode &quot;The Blaming of the Shrew&quot;. During the 1995–96 ABC lineup, she played Gracie Wallace in the sitcom &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;. She played Alex Marshall in the 2000 comedy &quot;What Women Want&quot;. In 2008, she became a regular on the drama &quot;Dirt&quot; as Sharlee Cates. In 2009, Johnson appeared in &quot;Omega&quot;, the first-season finale of Joss Whedon&#x27;s &quot;Dollhouse&quot;.

In 2012, she appeared in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (also directed by Whedon) as Beth, the waitress who is saved by Captain America. She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress Emily VanCamp&#x27;s Sharon Carter character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the Blu-ray edition of &quot;The Avengers&quot; contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the film and further her interactions with Rogers. From 2015 to 2020, Johnson played FBI forensic specialist Patterson in the NBC drama series &quot;Blindspot&quot;.

As a voice actress, Johnson&#x27;s earlier roles included Sean in the English dub of &quot;The First Snow of Winter&quot;, Gretchen Grundler on Disney&#x27;s &quot;Recess&quot;, Terra in the second and fifth seasons of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, Jinmay on &quot;Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!&quot; and Gwen Tennyson in the &quot;Ben 10&quot; franchise. A major voice role came when she provided the voice and motion capture for Ellie in the PlayStation action-adventure game &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, which was released to critical acclaim and commercial success. She won a video game BAFTA for Best Performer, a VGX Award for Best Voice Actress, and a D.I.C.E. Award for Outstanding Character Performance for her role in the game. On March 12, 2015, she won another BAFTA for Best Performer for the same role in the game&#x27;s downloadable content, &quot;The Last of Us: Left Behind&quot;. In 2015, she voiced Petra the Warrior in &quot;&quot; by Telltale Games and Mojang. In 2016, she voiced Tulip Olsen in the pilot for &quot;Infinity Train&quot; and reprised the role for the series in 2019, additionally voicing Lake and the Steward.

In 2020, Johnson reprised the role of Ellie in &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;. For her performance, she was nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards 2020, for Outstanding Achievement in Character at the 24th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards, and for Best Performer in a Leading Role at the 17th British Academy Games Awards. She portrayed Ellie&#x27;s mother, Anna, in the live-action adaptation of &quot;The Last of Us&quot;. On her performance in the adaptation, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; commented that &quot;with less than 10 minutes of screen time, Johnson gives us one of the best scenes of &quot;The Last of Us&quot;&quot;.

Johnson appeared in several Geek &amp; Sundry shows, including playing occult specialist Morgan on the web series &quot;Spooked&quot;, as well as the &quot;Alhambra&quot; and &quot;Dead of Winter&quot; episodes on the board gaming web series &quot;TableTop&quot;. In 2015, she began playing Pike Trickfoot on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; actual play show &quot;Critical Role&quot;; in 2018, she began playing Yasha Nydoorin in the show&#x27;s second campaign. &quot;Critical Role&quot; was both the Webby Winner and the People&#x27;s Voice Winner in the &quot;Games (Video Series &amp; Channels)&quot; category at the 2019 Webby Awards; the show was also both a finalist and the Audience Honor Winner at the 2019 Shorty Awards. After becoming hugely successful, the &quot;Critical Role&quot; cast left the Geek &amp; Sundry network in early 2019 and set up their own production company, Critical Role Productions. Soon after, they aimed to raise $750,000 on Kickstarter to create an animated series of their first campaign, but ended up raising over $11 million. In November 2019, Amazon Prime Video announced that they had acquired the streaming rights to this animated series, now titled &quot;The Legend of Vox Machina;&quot; Johnson reprised her role as Pike Trickfoot. In late 2020, she was made president of the Critical Role Foundation, the studio&#x27;s charity branch. In June 2021, she was added to the cast of &quot;Exandria Unlimited&quot;, an anthology spinoff of &quot;Critical Role&quot;. Three months later, she served as gamemaster for &quot;The Nautilus Ark&quot;, her own one-shot episode on the &quot;Critical Role&quot; channel. In October 2021, Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Exandria Unlimited&quot; character Fearne Calloway returned in &quot;Critical Role&quot;″s third campaign.

Johnson set up a photography company called Infinity Pictures with Mila Shah, her childhood best friend who works as a production assistant and occasional actress; there have been no updates on the company for many years, though it is still registered as being active as of 2022. Johnson and Shah also co-hosted a podcast called &quot;Wildly Hot &amp; Bothered&quot;, which ran for 13 episodes from 2012 to 2014. In 2015, they created and starred in &quot;Little Things&quot;, a web miniseries on YouTube about two friends living in Los Angeles and their habit of making awkward everyday situations even worse. The series was not released on YouTube until 2018.

==Personal life==
The first campaign of &quot;Critical Role&quot; began two years prior to the start of the series as a one-off, simplified &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game for Liam O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s birthday. The players enjoyed the game so much that they continued to play it and brought in additional friends, including Johnson, who joined in the second game. After Felicia Day heard about the private home game from Johnson, she approached the group about playing it in a live-streamed format for Geek &amp; Sundry.

Johnson enjoys singing and can play the guitar, piano, violin, and cello; she occasionally posted covers of songs on her SoundCloud page until late 2012. Her performance as Ellie in &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot; included acoustic guitar covers of &quot;Future Days&quot; by Pearl Jam, &quot;Take On Me&quot; by A-ha, &quot;True Faith&quot; by New Order, and &quot;Through the Valley&quot; by Shawn James. She also joined co-star Troy Baker (in character as Ellie and Joel) to perform a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;, which plays over the end credits of the game. She later provided vocals for the &quot;Critical Role&quot; theme songs &quot;Your Turn to Roll&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Thursday Night&quot;.

In 2012, Johnson began dating writer and musician Brian W. Foster, who also went on to host the &quot;Critical Role&quot; after-show &quot;Talks Machina&quot;. Johnson was first introduced to Foster by Troy Baker when working on &quot;The Last of Us&quot;; Foster and Baker were then roommates. The couple announced their engagement in December 2018. In May 2023, it was reported that Johnson had separated from Foster and filed a restraining order against him, citing abuse and threats. All videos and mentions of Foster were subsequently wiped from the online profiles of &quot;Critical Role&quot;. In October 2023, Johnson and six other women (including her sister and two &quot;Critical Role&quot; employees) filed a lawsuit against Foster that alleged assault, domestic violence, gender violence, sexual battery, stalking, civil rights violations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

<text>Will Friedle (; born August 11, 1976) is an American actor and screenwriter. He is best known for his role as Eric Matthews in the ABC sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; (1993–2000).

In animation, Friedle&#x27;s first voice acting role was the lead role of Terry McGinnis / Batman in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001). He also voiced Ron Stoppable in &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2002–2007), Doyle Blackwell in &quot;The Secret Saturdays&quot; (2008), Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle in &quot;&quot; (2008–2011), Lion-O in the 2011–12 reboot of &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, Bumblebee in the &quot;Transformers&quot; franchise (2013–2016), Star-Lord in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2015–2019), and Kashaw Vesh in &quot;The Legend of Vox Machina&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
Friedle was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the youngest of three boys of Patricia Joan (née Leary) and Gary Allen Friedle, both lawyers. His older brothers are Gary and Greg Friedle. After committing himself to becoming an actor, Friedle continually commuted from Avon, Connecticut, to New York City for auditions. He graduated from Avon High School in 1994.

Friedle is allegedly credited on school brochures as having attended Occidental College. However, when interviewed on the February 11, 2019, episode of &quot;Critical Role: Between the Sheets&quot;, he admitted having never attended the school. He stated that he learned he was being inaccurately credited by Occidental College as being an alumnus when his nephew visited the school and showed him the information package. Occidental College is not able to confirm that Friedle was ever used on marketing brochures; however, co-star Rider Strong attended Occidental College briefly during the filming of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. Additionally, he stated that he studied Latin for six years because he intended to become an archaeologist eventually. In the July 4, 2006, issue of &quot;People&quot;, Friedle mentioned he had thought about attending culinary school.

==Career==
After co-hosting Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Sit There!&quot; for three seasons (1988–1991), Friedle&#x27;s breakthrough came when he was cast as Cory Matthews&#x27;s likeable but underachieving elder brother Eric on the long-running TV sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; from 1993 to 2000. In 1998, he starred with Elisabeth Harnois, Dabney Coleman, and Jay Thomas in &quot;My Date with the President&#x27;s Daughter&quot; as part of The Wonderful World of Disney.

In 2004, he co-starred with Chris Owen in the independent film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Gold Diggers&quot; (originally titled &quot;Lady Killers&quot;). He also appeared in a supporting role in the 2005 ABC Family film &quot;Everything You Want.&quot; Friedle was cast as Mike in &quot;Off Centre&quot;, but could not accept the role because of a previous commitment to &quot;The Random Years&quot;. The role ended up going to Eddie Kaye Thomas.

In December 2013, in spite of initial reluctance, it was announced that Friedle would reprise his role as Eric in the sequel series &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;.

=== Voice acting ===
Friedle&#x27;s first voice acting role was the lead role in &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; (1999–2001) where he provided the voice of Terry McGinnis / Batman. He has reprised this role in multiple DC animated projects such as &quot;The Zeta Project&quot; (2001), &quot;Static Shock&quot; (2004), &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (2004), and &quot;Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; (2024). In April 2014, it was confirmed that Friedle reprised his &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; role of Terry McGinnis on the &quot;Batman Beyond&quot; short made by Darwyn Cooke to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Batman.

Friedle voiced Seifer Almasy in the English-language version of the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (2005), Gideon Wyeth in the English-language version of the video game &quot;Advent Rising&quot; (2005), and Jaster Rogue in the English-language version of the video game &quot;Rogue Galaxy&quot; (2005). From 2008 to 2011, he voiced Jaime Reyes / Blue Beetle on &quot;&quot;.

In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented that &quot;Friedle has largely ditched on-camera acting for voiceover work&quot;, though he is &quot;nevertheless best known as Eric Matthews, Cory&#x27;s cute but dim brother on &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Bustle&quot; highlighted that &quot;after &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; was over, Friedle mostly went on to do mainly animated voice roles&quot; and that he has &quot;provided the voice of characters like Ron Stoppable (&quot;Kim Possible&quot;), Fang (&quot;Teen Titans&quot;), Ken Tennyson (&quot;Ben 10: Alien Force&quot;)&quot;,&quot; and Kid Flash (&quot;Teen Titans Go!&quot;) — which is literally just a small handful of the numerous cartoons his voice can be heard in, either as a series regular or just for a single episode&quot;.

From 2015 to 2019, he starred as Star-Lord on &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.

In 2022, he reprised his role of Kashaw Vesh in &quot;The Legend of Vox Machina&quot;, an adaptation of the web series &quot;Critical Role&quot;; he originally appeared as Kashaw in the first campaign (2015–2017) of the actual play as a guest player. On June 15, 2022, Friedle voiced Radiant Black in a promotional online short.

=== Podcasts and web series ===
From July 2017 to November 2018, Friedle hosted three seasons of the web series &quot;Geek &amp; Sundry Painters Guild&quot;. The show originated from Friedle &quot;painting&quot; a miniature with &quot;magic marker&quot; and, after discovering this, Marisha Ray pitched Friedle on a show where he would be taught to paint miniatures correctly by various experts. After the conclusion of that series, Ray reached out to pitch &quot;Mini Primetime&quot; (2019) where Friedle would host a similar painting show for Critical Role&#x27;s new YouTube channel. On June 27, 2019, the premiere episode of &quot;Christy&#x27;s Kitchen Throwback&quot; featuring Friedle was uploaded to Christy Carlson Romano&#x27;s YouTube channel.

Friedle and Romano co-hosted the podcast called &quot;I Hear Voices&quot; from 2022 to 2023 which was available on Romano&#x27;s YouTube channel and other podcast providers. In June 2022, the podcast did a &quot;Kim Possible&quot; 20th anniversary special episode with creators Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley and voice actors John DiMaggio (Drakken) and Nicole Sullivan (Shego), as well as a brand new &quot;Kim Possible&quot; scene with the four actors written by McCorkle and Schooley and directed by original voice director Lisa Schaffer. He has hosted the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; rewatch podcast &quot;Pod Meets World&quot; with Danielle Fishel and Rider Strong .

In 2024, he began to co-host the rewatch podcast &quot;Magical Rewind&quot; with Sabrina Bryan, which focuses on Disney Channel Original Movies.

==Personal life==
In 1997, Friedle briefly dated actress Jennifer Love Hewitt. He co-starred with her in the romantic teen comedy &quot;Trojan War&quot;, and Hewitt parodied herself in the &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; episode &quot;And Then There Was Shawn&quot;. He married his girlfriend, Susan Martens, on September 25, 2016, in Connecticut. His affectionate name for her is Mrs. Squirrels, referencing Eric&#x27;s nickname &quot;Plays With Squirrels&quot; from the final season of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;.

Friedle is best friends with actor Jason Marsden and was the best man at his wedding in October 2004. The two have also worked together in numerous productions: &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Trojan War&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;, &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;ThunderCats&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Mad&quot;.

<doc id="674901" wikidata="Q6021422" url="?curid=674901" title="Indian River (Delaware)">
<text>The Indian River is a river and estuary, approximately long, in Sussex County in southern Delaware in the United States. The river is named after a Native American reservation that was located on its upper reaches.

The Indian River rises approximately southwest of Georgetown and flows east, past Millsboro, its head of navigation. It enters Indian River Bay, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Henlopen. The lower of the river form a navigable tidal estuary stretching westward from Indian River Bay, which is protected from the open ocean by two sand bar peninsulas. East of the bay is its mouth, the Indian River Inlet.

Until 1928, the Indian River Inlet was a natural waterway that shifted up and down a two-mile (3.2 km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937. In 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place to improve operations for river users.
Roads cross the river in three places, at U.S. Route 113 (in Millsboro), Delaware Route 24/Delaware Route 30 (also in Millsboro), and Delaware Route 1 (at Indian River Inlet in the Delaware Seashore State Park).

With the Indian River Inlet in a fixed place beginning in 1928, it became possible to build a bridge to span it. In 1933 Ocean Highway was completed (the present-day Delaware Route 1 and now known as Coastal Highway) between Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach.

Following that, Delaware built a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway. Since 1934, six bridges have spanned the inlet, all known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge. All but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge. The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened in 2012.

<text>The Battle of Kharkov was any one of four World War II battles in and near the Soviet city of Kharkov in modern Ukraine. In usage the term is sometimes indistinct, perhaps meaning the collection of all fighting at Kharkov including and in between the four named battles, or perhaps meaning just one of the battles without specifying which. For example, soldiers have received awards &quot;for their action in the Battle of Kharkov&quot;.

The four named battles are:
* First Battle of Kharkov, an October 1941 battle in which German troops captured the city
* Second Battle of Kharkov, a May 1942 battle in which Soviet forces attempted to retake the city
* Third Battle of Kharkov, a February 1943 battle in which Soviet forces were driven out again, and the Germans forces retook the city
* Belgorod–Kharkov offensive operation, an August 1943 battle in which Soviet forces retook the city. In German nomenclature, the operation is usually referred to as the Fourth Battle of Kharkov.

<doc id="674905" wikidata="Q1907315" url="?curid=674905" title="Mass trespass of Kinder Scout">
<text>The mass trespass of Kinder Scout was a trespass protest at Kinder Scout in the Peak District, Derbyshire, England, on 24 April 1932. The protest sought to highlight that walkers were denied access to areas of open countryside which had been fenced off by wealthy landowners who forbade public access. It was organised by communist leader and Jewish anti-fascist Benny Rothman, the secretary of the British Workers&#x27; Sports Federation and a member of the Young Communist League.

Although the mass trespass was a controversial strategy at the time, the imprisonment of some of the trespassers led to public outrage, which increased public support for open access land. Some of the trespassers went on to become successful activists and politicians, and some later died fighting against fascism during the Spanish Civil War.

Many details of the event such as the exact turnout of protesters, whether the trespass helped the cause of public access in the immediate aftermath of the event, and even whether some of the trespassers ever made it to the summit, have been heavily debated by historians.

== Background ==
In the early 1800s the moorland of Kinder Scout was a popular area for hikers (known as ramblers) to visit and enjoy the natural beauty of the area. However, wealthy landowners began to guard the land zealously, forcefully evicting members of the public, leading to Kinder Scout being nicknamed &quot;forbidden Kinder&quot;. All legal attempts to open the land failed as the landowners were unwilling to compromise, and landowners began attacking members of the public with dogs. Without any evidence, the landowners claimed that hikers disturbed grouse bird nesting, which the landowners sought to profit from.

During the 1930s, there was increasing pressure for greater public freedom to access mountains and moorlands as members of the public sought to escape the grim conditions of towns and cities. There was also a massive increase in sports clubs led by Marxist political activists, who opposed the private ownership of large areas of countryside. Frustrated by the lack of progress achieved through lobbying parliament to grant the public free access to the countryside, some activists took to illegally trespassing on privately owned countryside as a form of protest against wealthy landowners.

== The event ==
The 1932 trespass was a coordinated protest involving three groups of walkers who approached Kinder Scout from different directions at the same time. Accounts of the numbers involved vary widely: a &quot;Times&quot; article at the time reported that it was about 100, Benny Rothman claimed it was between 600 and 800, and poet and folk singer Ewan MacColl, who participated in the walk and wrote a song sung by the walkers, remembered it as over 3,000. The generally accepted figure is that reported by the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; at the time, of an estimated 400 people. The trespassers began at Bowden Bridge quarry near Hayfield. They proceeded via William Clough to the plateau of Kinder Scout, where there were violent scuffles with gamekeepers. The ramblers were able to reach their destination and meet with another group at Ashop Head. On the return, five ramblers were arrested, with another detained earlier. Trespass was not and is not a criminal offence in England, but some received jail sentences of two to six months for offences relating to violence involving the keepers.

== Political effects ==

According to the Hayfield Kinder Trespass Group website, this act of civil disobedience was one of the most successful in British history. It arguably led to the passage of the National Parks legislation in 1949 and helped pave way for the establishment of the Pennine Way and other long-distance footpaths. Walkers&#x27; rights to travel through common land and uncultivated upland were eventually protected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CROW Act) of 2000. Though controversial when it occurred, it has been interpreted as the embodiment of &quot;working class struggle for the right to roam versus the rights of the wealthy to have exclusive use of moorlands for grouse shooting.&quot;

The Kinder mass trespass was one of a number of protests at the time seeking greater access to the moorlands of the northern Peak District. What set it apart from the others was it marked a new and more radical approach to the problem which was not universally popular with rambling groups. The harshness of the sentences imposed on the leaders of the protest was headline news in local and national newspapers, resulting in the issue gaining public attention and sympathy. The subsequent access rally staged in Winnats Pass attracted 10,000 people to attend in support of greater access to the adjacent moorland.

An unintended consequence of the mass trespass was greater interest being paid to ramblers&#x27; behaviour and potential ways to regulate it. This resulted in a &#x27;Code of Courtesy for the Countryside&#x27; being produced, which was a forerunner of the modern Countryside Code.

== Revisionism ==
A number of writers have criticised the narrative of the success of the Kinder Scout trespass. In 2011, historian David Hey questioned the narrative of the Kinder Scout trespass as &quot;a simple explanation of the triumph of the &#x27;right to roam&#x27; movement&quot;. According to Hey, the trespass on balance did &quot;more harm than good&quot;. In 2002, Philip Day of the Manchester Ramblers&#x27; Federation stated the trespass was commonly used by opponents of the access movement as an argument for denying access even into the 1950s and 1960s, bringing a &quot;positive hindrance&quot; to the efforts of the movement. In 1989, walkers&#x27; rights activist Tom Stephenson challenged the assertion that the trespassers had reached the summit of Kinder Scout, saying they made it only as far as Ashop Head. In 2013, historian John K. Walton questioned the absolutism of this revisionism. He advocated for a post-revisionist stance on the mass trespass, acknowledging its positive effects both in the short and long term. He pointed to its symbolic role in the access campaign over the rest of the century that led to the CROW act.

== Commemoration ==
Ewan MacColl (then known by his real name, Jimmie Miller) anticipated these events in his 1932 song &quot;The Manchester Rambler&quot;. The events form the subject of the song &quot;You Can (Mass Trespass, 1932)&quot; on Chumbawamba&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;A Singsong and a Scrap&quot; and inspiration for &quot;Walking in the Footsteps of Giants&quot; by northern folk band Harp and a Monkey.

Each year, a combination of wardens and rangers from both The National Trust and the Peak District National Park Authority hold a walking event to mark the anniversary of the trespass. A commemorative plaque marks the start of the trespass at Bowden Bridge quarry near Hayfield, now a popular area for ramblers. It was unveiled in April 1982 by Benny Rothman (then aged 70) during a rally to mark the 50th anniversary.

The Young Communist League hikes up Kinder Scout every year on their annual Communist Summer Camp to commemorate their involvement in the trespass.

<doc id="674908" wikidata="Q5538264" url="?curid=674908" title="George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe">
<text>George Cubitt, 1st Baron Ashcombe, (4 June 1828 – 26 February 1917) of Denbies House, Dorking, Surrey, was a British politician and peer, a son of Thomas Cubitt, the leading London builder and property developer of his day.

==Education and career==
Cubitt was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first a BA and later took his honorary MA. He won election as a Conservative MP for West Surrey from 1860 to 1885, and then for Epsom until 1892, when elevated to the Lords as Baron Ashcombe, &quot;of Dorking, in the County of Surrey and of Bodiam Castle, in the County of Sussex&quot;, having been invested as a Privy Counsellor in 1880. He also served as Honorary Colonel of the 5th Battalion, Royal West Surrey Regiment, and Deputy Lieutenant of the counties of both Surrey and Middlesex.

Hansard shows he made 81 speeches or questions in Parliament, from 1863 to 1909, including contributing in four years of the 1890s and two years of the 1900s.

==Legacies==

Denbies, a large hillside north of Dorking, Surrey was part of the inheritance from his father; Cubitt lived in the mansion built by his father there until 1905, much of which has been taken up by a viticulture centre, spa hotel, restaurant and vineyard.

Upmarket street Ashcombe Road in Dorking is named after his peerage as is its amenity The Ashcombe School, the town&#x27;s main senior school.

Through his funds he founded a landmark, hilltop church of St Barnabas, Ranmore Common, provided for the Denbies Estate&#x27;s owners and employees. Collaborative historians&#x27; work the Victoria County History states it is &quot;a handsome stone church, with chancel, nave, and aisles in 13th-century style&quot;.

Cubitt purchased Bodiam Castle and its from Fuller&#x27;s grandson in 1849, possibly local farmer Thomas Levett, descendant of an old Sussex family and owner of Court Lodge Farm a seller in a later smaller sale nearby, for over £5,000 (£ today).. Lord Curzon decided that &quot;so rare a treasure [as Bodiam Castle] should neither be lost to our country nor desecrated by irreverent hands&quot;. Curzon made enquiries about buying the castle, but Cubitt did not wish to sell. However, after Cubitt&#x27;s death, Curzon was able to make a deal with Cubitt&#x27;s son; he bought the castle and its lands in 1916. Curzon began a programme of investigation at Bodiam in 1919, and with architect William Weir more greatly restored parts of the castle. Its museum, design and authenticity make it a significant English tourist attraction.

While an MP for West Surrey, Cubitt and his wife Laura, Lady Ashcombe were among the founders and benefactors of St Catherine&#x27;s School in Bramley, Surrey in 1885. One of the schoolhouses was named in his honour after his death. His wife&#x27;s gift to the school was a Sanatorium, which cared for sick pupils. A stained glassed window in the school chapel, dedicated to St Cecilia, was created by Cubitt in remembrance of his wife after she died in 1904. The patron of the school is their great-great-granddaughter Queen Camilla.

His will passed assets worth its executor being his surviving son.

==Death and burial==
He died on 26 February 1917 and was buried in the churchyard of St Barnabas&#x27;s.

==Family==
Cubitt married Laura Joyce, daughter of James Joyce, Vicar of Dorking, on 14 June 1853 and with her had 9 children; 3 sons, though only the third, Henry, survived beyond infancy, and 6 daughters, one of whom died in infancy:

* Geoffrey George Cubitt (born 31 May 1854, died 6 June 1855)
* Thomas Edmund Wilfred Cubitt (born 5 August 1859, died 17 May 1865)
* Henry Cubitt (born 14 March 1867, died 27 October 1947) - succeeded his father as the 2nd Baron Ashcombe
* Helen Laura Cubitt (died 16 August 1939)
* Mary Agnes Cubitt (died 6 February 1944) - married Rev. Edward Arthur Chichester
* Adelaide Laura Cubitt (died 3 November 1922) - married Richard Anthony Fuller-Maitland
* Mildred Sophia Cubitt (died 9 March 1930) - married George William Tallents
* Mabel Georgina Cubitt (died 5 November 1865)
* Beatrice Hayward Cubitt (died 12 February 1963) - married William Archibald Calvert

He is the maternal great-great grandfather of Queen Camilla, wife of King Charles III.

<text>In Russia, the state provides most education services regulating education through the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. Regional authorities regulate education within their jurisdictions within the prevailing framework of federal laws. Russia&#x27;s expenditure on education has grown from 2.7% of the GDP in 2005 to 4.7% in 2018 but remains below the OECD average of 4.9%.

Before 1990 the course of school training in the Soviet Union lasted 10 years, but at the end of 1990, an 11-year course officially came into operation. Education in state-owned secondary schools is free; &quot;first&quot; tertiary (university level) education is free with reservations: a substantial number of students enroll on full pay. Male and female students have equal shares in all stages of education, except in tertiary education where women lead with 57%.

A 2015 estimate by the United States Central Intelligence Agency puts the literacy rate in Russia at 99.7% (99.7% for men, 99.6% for women). According to a 2016 OECD estimate, 54% of Russia&#x27;s adults (25- to 64-year-olds) have attained tertiary education, giving Russia the second-highest attainment of tertiary education among 35 OECD member countries. 47.7% have completed secondary education (the full 11-year course); 26.5% have completed middle school (9 years) and 8.1% have elementary education (at least 4 years). The highest rates of tertiary education (24.7%) are recorded among women aged 35 to 39 years (compared to 19.5% for men of the same age bracket).

Compared with other OECD countries, Russia has close to average class sizes and some of the shortest instruction hours per year.

In 2014 the Pearson/Economist Intelligence Unit rated Russia&#x27;s education as the 8th-best in Europe and the 13th-best in the world; Russia&#x27;s educational attainment was rated as the 21st-highest in the world, and the students&#x27; cognitive skills as the 9th-highest.

In 2015 the OECD ranked Russian students&#x27; mathematics and science skills as the 34th-best in the world, between Sweden and Iceland.

In 2016 the US company Bloomberg rated Russia&#x27;s higher education as the third-best in the world, measuring the percentage of high-school graduates who go on to attend college, the annual science and engineering graduates as a percentage of all college graduates, and science and engineering graduates as a percentage of the labor force.

In 2014 Russia ranked as the 6th most popular destination for international students.

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative finds that Russia is fulfilling 86.8% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education, based on its level of income.

==Levels of education==
According to the law, the educational system of Russia includes 2 types of education: general and professional.

General education has the following levels:
* Preschool education (level 0 according to the ISCED)
* Primary general education (level 1 according to the ISCED) – the duration of study is 4 years
* Basic general education (level 2 according to the ISCED) – the duration of study is 5 years
* Secondary general education (level 3 according to the ISCED) – the duration of study is 2 years
Furthermore, there is also an additional general education (school-based study groups and clubs).

Professional education has the following levels:
* Training for professions – it is available on the basis of primary general education; the duration of study depends on the particular profession, as a rule, not exceeding several months
* Vocational education – it is available on the basis of basic general education or secondary general education; the duration of study is 3 years (on the basis of secondary general education) or 4 years (on the basis of basic general education; in this case the program includes secondary general education)
* Higher education:
** Bachelor&#x27;s degree – it is available on the basis of secondary general education; the duration of study is 4 years
** Specialist degree – it is available on the basis of secondary general education and only for certain medical and engineering specialties; the duration of study is from 5 to 6 years depending on the particular academic major
** Master&#x27;s degree – it is available for persons who have any academic degree; the duration of study is 2 years
* Postgraduate education (graduate school, residency in medicine, assistantship in the field of art, adjunctura in the field of military science) – it is available for persons who have a specialist degree or master&#x27;s degree; the duration of study is from 2 to 4 years depending on academic discipline
Furthermore, there is also an additional professional education. It is available for graduates of institutions of vocational or higher education.

==Preschool and primary school==


According to the 2002 census, 68% of children (78% urban and 47% rural) aged 5 were enrolled in kindergartens. According to UNESCO data, enrollment in &quot;any&quot; kind of pre-school programme increased from 67% in 1999 to 84% in 2005.

Kindergartens, unlike schools, are regulated by regional and local authorities. The Ministry of Education and Science regulates only a brief preschool preparation program for 5–6-year-old children. In 2004 the government attempted to charge the full cost of kindergartens to the parents; widespread public opposition caused a reversal of policy. Currently, local authorities can legally charge the parents not more than 20% of costs. Twins, children of university students, refugees, Chernobyl veterans, and other protected social groups are entitled to free service.

In 2019, pre-school (or Kindergarten) begins at the age of two months old to six years old.

The Soviet system provided for nearly universal primary (nursery, age 1 to 3) and kindergarten (age 3 to 7) service in urban areas, relieving working mothers from daytime childcare needs. By the 1980s, there were 88,000 preschool institutions; as the secondary-education study load increased and moved from the ten to eleven-year standard, the kindergarten programmes shifted from training basic social skills, or physical abilities, to preparation for entering the school level. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the number decreased to 46,000; kindergarten buildings were sold as real estate, irreversibly rebuilt and converted for office use. At the same time, a minority share of successful state-owned kindergartens, regarded as a vertical lift to quality schooling, flourished throughout the 1990s. Privately owned kindergartens, although in high demand, did not gain a significant share due to administrative pressure; share of children enrolled in private kindergartens dropped from 7% in 1999 to 1% in 2005.

The improvement of the economy after the 1998 crisis, coupled with historical demographic peak, resulted in an increase in birth rate, first recorded in 2005. Large cities encountered shortage of kindergarten vacancies earlier, in 2002. Moscow&#x27;s kindergarten waiting list included 15,000 children; in the much smaller city of Tomsk (population 488,000) it reached 12,000. The city of Moscow instituted specialised &quot;kindergarten commissions&quot; that are tasked with locating empty slots for the children; parents sign their children on the waiting list as soon as they are born. The degree of the problem varies between districts, e.g. Moscow&#x27;s Fili-Davydkovo District (population 78,000) has lost &quot;all&quot; of its kindergartens (residents have to compete for kindergarten slots elsewhere) while Zelenograd claims to have short queue. Independent authors assert that bribes or &quot;donations&quot; for admission to kindergartens compete in amount with university admissions while authorities refute the accusation.

The number of Russian children enrolled in preschool institutions reached 7.44 million in 2020, marking a decrease from the previous year. The birth rate saw a decrease from 2020, after growing in the late 2000s and the early 2010s.

==Secondary school==
===General framework===
There were 59,260 general education schools in 2007–2008 school year, an increase from 58,503 in the previous year. However, prior to 2005–2006, the number of schools was steadily decreasing from 65,899 in 2000–2001. The 2007–2008 number includes 4,965 advanced learning schools specializing in foreign languages, mathematics etc.; 2,347 advanced general-purpose schools, and 1,884 schools for all categories of disabled children; it does &quot;not&quot; include vocational technical school and technicums. Private schools accounted for 0.3% of elementary school enrollment in 2005 and 0.5% in 2005.

According to a 2005 UNESCO report, 96% of the adult population has completed lower secondary schooling and most of them also have an upper secondary education.

Nine-year secondary education in Russia is compulsory since September 1, 2007. Until 2007, it was limited to nine years with grades 10-11 optional; federal subjects of Russia could enforce higher compulsory standard through local legislation within the eleven–year federal programme. Moscow enacted compulsory eleven–year education in 2005, similar legislation existed in Altai Krai, Sakha and Tyumen Oblast. A student of 15 to 18 years of age &quot;may&quot; drop out of school with the approval of his/her parent and local authorities, and without their consent upon reaching age of 18. Expulsion from school for multiple violations disrupting school life is possible starting at the age of 15.

The eleven-year school term is split into elementary (years 1–4), middle (years 5–9), and senior (years 10–11) classes. The absolute majority of children attend full programme schools providing eleven-year education; schools limited to elementary or elementary and middle classes typically exist in rural areas. Of all the 59,260 schools in Russia, 36,248 provide the full eleven-year programme, 10,833 offer nine-year &quot;basic&quot; (elementary and middle) education, and 10,198 only offer elementary education. Their number is disproportionately large compared to their share of students due to lesser class sizes in rural schools. In areas where school capacity is insufficient to teach all students on a normal, morning-to-afternoon, schedule, authorities resort to &quot;double-shift&quot; schools, where two streams of students (&quot;morning shift&quot; and &quot;evening shift&quot;) share the same facility. There were 13,100 &quot;double-shift&quot; and 75 &quot;triple-shift&quot; schools in 2007–2008, compared to 19,201 and 235 in 2000–2001.

Children are accepted to the first year at the age of 6 or 7, depending on the individual development of each child. Until 1990, starting age was set at seven years and schooling lasted ten years for students who were planning to proceed to higher education in Universities. Students who were planning to proceed to technical schools were doing so, as a rule, after the 8th year. The switch from a ten to eleven-year term was motivated by continuously increasing load in middle and senior years. In the 1960s, it resulted in a &quot;conversion&quot; of the fourth year from elementary to middle school. The decrease in elementary schooling led to greater disparity between children entering middle school; to compensate for the &quot;missing&quot; fourth year, elementary schooling was extended with a &quot;zero year&quot; for six-year-olds. This move remains a subject of controversy.

Children of elementary classes are normally separated from other classes within their own floor of a school building. They are taught, ideally, by a single teacher through all four elementary years (except for physical training and, if available, foreign languages); 98.5% of elementary school teachers are women. Their number decreased from 349,000 in 1999 to 317,000 in 2005. Starting from the fifth year, each academic subject is taught by a dedicated subject teacher (80.4% women in 2004, an increase from 75.4% in 1991). Pupil-to-teacher ratio (11:1) is on par with developed European countries. Teachers&#x27; average monthly salaries in 2008 range from 6,200 roubles (200 US dollars) in Mordovia to 21,000 roubles (700 US dollars) in Moscow.

The school year extends from September 1 to the end of May and is divided into four terms. Study programme in schools is fixed; unlike in some Western countries, schoolchildren or their parents have no choice of study subjects. Class load per student (638 hours a year for nine-year-olds, 893 for thirteen-year-olds) is lower than in Chile, Peru or Thailand, and slightly lower than in most states of the United States, although official hours are frequently appended with additional class work. Students are graded on a 5-step scale, ranging in practice from 2 (&quot;unacceptable&quot;) to 5 (&quot;excellent&quot;); 1 is a rarely used sign of extreme failure. Teachers regularly subdivide these grades (i.e. 4+, 5−) in daily use, but term and year results are graded strictly 2, 3, 4 or 5.

Some secondary schools conduct, in addition to the standard programme, an in-depth study of some subjects (schools focused on mathematics, foreign languages, arts, military-related subjects, etc.). These schools are considered more prestigious than the usual secondary schools.

===Vocational training option===

Upon completion of a nine-year program the student has a choice of either completing the remaining two years at normal school, or of a transfer to a specialized professional training school. Historically, those were divided into low-prestige PTUs and better-regarded technicums and medical (nurse level) schools; in the 2000s, many such institutions, if operational, have been renamed as &quot;colleges&quot;. They provide students with a vocational skill qualification and a high school certificate equivalent to 11-year education in a normal school; the programme, due to its work training component, extends over 3 years. In 2007–08 there were 2,800 such institutions with 2,280,000 students. Russian vocational schools, like the Tech Prep schools in the USA, fall out of ISCED classification, thus the enrollment number reported by UNESCO is lower, 1.41 million; the difference is attributed to senior classes of technicums that exceed secondary education standard.

All certificates of secondary education (Maturity Certificate, ), regardless of issuing institution, conform to the same national standard and are considered, at least in law, to be fully equivalent. The state prescribes a minimum (and nearly exhaustive) set of study subjects that must appear in each certificate. In practice, extension of study terms to three years slightly disadvantages vocational schools&#x27; male students who intend to continue: they reach conscription age before graduation or immediately after it, and normally must serve in the army before applying to undergraduate-level institutions.

Although all male pupils are eligible to postpone their conscription to receive higher education, they must be at least signed-up for the admission tests into the university the moment they get the conscription notice from the army. Most military commissariat officials are fairly considerate towards the potential recruits on that matter and usually allow graduates enough time to choose the university and sign-up for admission or enroll there on a paid basis despite the fact that the spring recruiting period has not yet ended by the time most students graduate. All those people may legally be commanded to present themselves to the recruitment centers the next day after graduation.

Males of conscription age that chose not to continue their education at any stage usually get notice from the army within half a year after their education ends, because of the periodic nature of recruitment periods in Russian army.

===Unified state examinations===

Traditionally, the universities and institutes conducted their own admissions tests regardless of the applicants&#x27; school record. There was no uniform measure of graduates&#x27; abilities; marks issued by high schools were perceived as incompatible due to grading variances between schools and regions. In 2003 the Ministry of Education launched the Unified state examination (USE) programme. The set of standardised tests for high school graduates, issued uniformly throughout the country and rated independent of the student&#x27;s schoolmasters, akin to the North American SAT, was supposed to replace entrance exams to state universities. Thus, the reformers reasoned, the USE would empower talented graduates from remote locations to compete for admissions at the universities of their choice, at the same time eliminating admission-related bribery, then estimated at 1 billion US dollars annually. In 2003, 858 university and college workers were indicted for bribery; the admission &quot;fee&quot; in MGIMO allegedly reached 30,000 US dollars.

University heads, notably Moscow State University rector Viktor Sadovnichiy, resisted the change, arguing that their schools cannot survive without charging the applicants with their own entrance hurdles. Nevertheless, the legislators enacted USE in February 2007. In 2008, it was mandatory for the students and optional for the universities; it is fully mandatory since 2009. A few higher education establishments are still allowed to introduce their own entrance tests in addition to USE scoring; such tests must be publicized in advance.

Awarding USE grades involves two stages. In this system, a &quot;primary grade&quot; is the sum of points for completed tasks, with each of the tasks having a maximum number of points allocated to it. The maximum total primary grade varies by subject, so that one might obtain, for instance, a primary grade of 23 out of 37 in mathematics and a primary grade of 43 out of 80 in French. The primary grades are then converted into final or &quot;test grades&quot; by means of a sophisticated statistical calculation, which takes into account the distribution of primary grades among the examinees. This system has been criticized for its lack of transparency.

The first nationwide USE session covering all regions of Russia was held in the summer of 2008. 25.3% students failed the literature test, 23.5% failed mathematics; the highest grades were recorded in French, English and social studies. Twenty thousand students filed objections against their grades; one third of objections were settled in the student&#x27;s favor.

The Basic State Exam is also held after nine years of education, two years before the Unified State Exam.

==Education for the disabled==

===Physical disability===
Children with physical disabilities, depending on the nature and extent of the disability and the availability of local specialized institutions, attend either such institutions or special classes within regular schools. As of 2007, there were 80 schools for the blind and children with poor eyesight; their school term is extended to 12 years and classes are limited to 9–12 pupils per teacher. Education for the deaf is provided by 99 specialized kindergartens and 207 secondary boarding schools; children who were born deaf are admitted to specialized kindergartens as early as possible, ideally from 18 months of age; they are schooled separately from children who lost hearing &quot;after&quot; acquiring basic speech skills. Vocational schools for the working deaf people who have not completed secondary education exist in five cities only. Another wide network of specialist institutions takes care of children with mobility disorders. 60–70% of all children with cerebral palsy are schooled through this channel. Children are admitted to specialised kindergartens at three or four years of age and streamed into narrow specialty groups; the specialisation continues throughout their school term and may extend to thirteen years. The system, however, is not ready to accept children who also display evident developmental disability; they have no other option than home schooling. All graduates of physical disability schools are entitled to the same level of secondary education certificates as normal graduates.

There are 42 specialized vocational training (non-degree) colleges for disabled people; most notable are the School of Music for the Blind in Kursk and the Medical School for the Blind in Kislovodsk. Fully segregated undergraduate education is provided by two colleges: the Institute of Arts for the Disabled (enrollment of 158 students in 2007) and the Social Humanitarian Institute (enrollment of 250 students), both in Moscow. Other institutions provide semi-segregated training (specialized groups within a normal college environment) or declare full disability access of their regular classes. Bauman Moscow State Technical University and Chelyabinsk State University have the highest number of disabled students (170 each, 2007). Bauman University focuses on education for the deaf; the Herzen Pedagogical Institute enroll different groups of physical disability. However, independent studies assert that the universities fail to integrate people with disabilities into their academic and social life.

===Mental disability===

An estimated 20% of children leaving kindergarten fail to adjust to elementary school requirements and are in need of special schooling. Children with delayed development who &quot;may&quot; return to normal schools and study along with normal children are trained at &quot;compensatory classes&quot; within regular schools. The system is intended to prepare these children for normal school at the earliest possible age, closing (compensating) the gap between them and normal students. It is a relatively new development that began in the 1970s and gained national approval in the 1990s.

Persistent but mild mental disabilities that preclude co-education with normal children in the foreseeable future but do not qualify as &quot;moderate, heavy, or severe retardation&quot; require specialized &quot;correction&quot; () boarding schools that extend from 8–9 to 18–21 years of age. Their task is to adapt the person to living in a modern society, rather than to subsequent education.

Children with stronger forms of intellectual disability are, as of 2008, mostly excluded from the education system. Some are trained within severe disability groups of the &quot;correction&quot; boarding schools and orphanages, others are aided only through counseling.

==Tertiary (university level) education==

According to a 2005 UNESCO report, more than half of the Russian adult population has attained a tertiary education, which is twice as high as the OECD average.

As of the 2007–2008 academic year, Russia had 8.1 million students enrolled in all forms of tertiary education (including military and police institutions and postgraduate studies). Foreign students accounted for 5.2% of enrollment, half of whom were from other CIS countries. 6.2 million students were enrolled in 658 state-owned and 450 private civilian university-level institutions licensed by the Ministry of Education; total faculty reached 625 thousands in 2005.

The number of state-owned institutions was rising steadily from 514 in 1990 to 655 in 2002 and remains nearly constant since 2002. The number of private institutions, first reported as 193 in 1995, continues to rise. The trend for consolidation began in 2006 when state universities and colleges of Rostov-on-Don, Taganrog and other southern towns were merged into Southern Federal University, based in Rostov-on-Don; a similar conglomerate was formed in Krasnoyarsk as Siberian Federal University; the third one emerged in Vladivostok as Far Eastern Federal University. Moscow State University and Saint Petersburg State University acquired the &quot;federal university&quot; status in 2007 without further organisational changes.

Andrei Fursenko, Minister of Education, is campaigning for a reduction in number of institutions to weed out diploma mills and substandard colleges; in April 2008 his stance was approved by president Dmitry Medvedev: &quot;This amount, around a thousand universities and two thousands spinoffs, does not exist anywhere else in the world; it may be over the top even for China ... consequences are clear: devaluation of education standard&quot;. Even supporters of the reduction like Yevgeny Yasin admit that the move will strengthen consolidation of academia in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk and devastate the provinces, leaving the federal subjects of Russia without colleges for training local school teachers. For a comparison, the United States has a total of 4,495 Title IV-eligible, degree-granting institutions: 2,774 BA/BSc degree institutions and 1,721 AA/ASc degree institutions.

Financial and visa difficulties have historically made it difficult to obtain higher education abroad for young adults in the post-Soviet era.

===Traditional model===

Unlike the United States or Bologna process model, Russian higher education was traditionally not divided into undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s) and graduate (master&#x27;s) levels. Instead, tertiary education was undertaken in a single stage, typically five or six years in duration, which resulted in a specialist diploma. Specialist diplomas were perceived equal to Western MSc/MA qualification. A specialist graduate needed no further academic qualification to pursue a professional career, with the exception of some (but not all) branches of medical professions that required a post-graduate residency stage. Military college education lasted four years and was ranked as equivalent to &quot;specialist&quot; degree.

Historically, civilian tertiary education was divided between a minority of traditional wide curriculum universities and a larger number of narrow specialisation &quot;institutes&quot; (including art schools). Many of these institutes, such as the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, and the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography, are concentrated primarily in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Institutes whose graduates are in wide demand throughout Russia, such as medical and teachers&#x27; institutes, are spread more evenly across the country. Institutes in geographically specific fields will tend to be situated in areas serving their specialties. Mining and metallurgy institutes are located in ore-rich territories, and maritime and fishing institutes are located in seaport communities.

Legal education in Russia exists both within universities and as standalone law institutes such as the Academic Law University (Russian: Академический правовой университет, АПУ) founded under the auspices of the Institute of State and Law. In the 1990s many technical institutes and new private schools created their own departments of law; as of 2008, law departments trained around 750 thousands students.

In the 1990s the institutes typically renamed themselves &quot;universities&quot;, while retaining their historical narrow specialisation. More recently, a number of these new private &#x27;universities&#x27; have been renamed back to &#x27;institutes&#x27; to reflect their narrower specialization. In these institutes, the student&#x27;s specialisation within a chosen department was fixed upon admission, and moving between different streams within the same department was difficult. Study programmes were (and still are) rigidly fixed for the whole term of study; the students have little choice in planning their academic progress. Mobility between institutions with compatible study programmes was allowed infrequently, usually due to family relocation from town to town.

===Move towards Bologna Process===
Russia is in the process of migrating from its traditional tertiary education model, incompatible with existing Western academic degrees, to a degree structure in line with the Bologna Process model. (Russia co-signed the Bologna Declaration in 2003.) In October 2007 Russia enacted a law that replaces the traditional five-year model of education with a two-tiered approach: a four-year bachelor () degree followed by a two-year master&#x27;s (, &quot;magistr&quot;) degree.

The move has been criticised for its merely formal approach: instead of reshaping their curriculum, universities would simply insert a BSc/BA accreditation in the middle of their standard five or six-year programmes. The job market is generally unaware of the change and critics predict that stand-alone BSc/BA diplomas will not be recognised as &quot;real&quot; university education in the foreseeable future, rendering the degree unnecessary and undesirable without further specialisation. Institutions like MFTI or MIFI have practiced a two-tier breakdown of their &quot;specialist&quot; programmes for decades and switched to Bologna process designations well in advance of the 2007 law, but an absolute majority of their students complete all six years of MSc/MA curriculum, regarding BSc/BA stage as useless in real life.

Student mobility among universities has been traditionally discouraged and thus kept at very low level; there are no signs that formal acceptance of the Bologna Process will help students seeking better education. Finally, while the five-year &quot;specialist&quot; training was previously free to all students, the new MSc/MA stage is not. The shift forces students to pay for what was free to the previous class; the cost is unavoidable because the BSc/BA degree alone is considered useless. Defenders of the Bologna Process argue that the final years of the &quot;specialist&quot; programme were formal and useless: academic schedules were relaxed and undemanding, allowing students to work elsewhere. Cutting the five-year &quot;specialist&quot; programme to a four-year BSc/BA will not decrease the actual academic content of most of these programmes.

==Post-graduate levels==
Postgraduate diploma structure so far retains its unique Soviet pattern established in 1934. The system makes a distinction between &quot;scientific degrees&quot;, evidencing personal postgraduate achievement in scientific research, and related but separate &quot;academic titles&quot;, evidencing personal achievement in university-level education.

There are two successive postgraduate &quot;degrees&quot;: kandidat nauk (&quot;Candidate of science&quot;) and doktor nauk (&quot;Doctor of Science&quot;). Both are a certificate of scientific, rather than academic, achievement, and must be backed up by original/novel scientific work, evidenced by publications in peer-reviewed journals and a dissertation defended in front of senior academic board. The titles are issued by Higher Attestation Commission of the Ministry of Education. A degree is always awarded in one of 23 predetermined fields of science, even if the underlying achievement belongs to different fields. Thus it is possible to defend two degrees of &quot;kandidat&quot; independently, but not simultaneously; a &quot;doktor&quot; in one field may also be a &quot;kandidat&quot; in a different field.

&quot;Kandidat nauk&quot; can be achieved within university environment (when the university is engaged in active research in the chosen field), specialised research facilities or within research and development units in industry. Typical &quot;kandidat nauk&quot; path from admission to diploma takes 2–4 years. The dissertation paper should contain a solution of an existing scientific problem, or a practical proposal with significant economical or military potential. The title is often perceived as equivalent to Western Ph.D., although this may vary depending on the field of study, and may not be seen as such outside of Russia but as a more significant degree.

&quot;Doktor nauk&quot;, the next stage, implies achieving significant scientific output. This title is often equated to the German or Scandinavian habilitation. The dissertation paper should summarize the author&#x27;s research resulting in theoretical statements that are qualified as a new discovery, or solution of an existing problem, or a practical proposal with significant economical or military potential. The road from &quot;kandidat&quot; to &quot;doktor&quot; typically takes 10 years of dedicated research activity; one in four candidates reaches this stage. The system implies that the applicants must work in their research field full-time; however, the degrees in social sciences are routinely awarded to active politicians.

Academic &quot;titles&quot; of &quot;dotsent&quot; and &quot;professor&quot; are issued to active university staff who already achieved degrees of &quot;kandidat&quot; or &quot;doktor&quot;; the rules prescribe minimum residency term, authoring established study textbooks in their chosen field, and mentoring successful postgraduate trainees; special, less formal rules apply to professors of arts.

Military postgraduate education radically falls out of the standard scheme. It includes military academy courses and adjunctura (). Unlike their Western namesakes, Russian military academies are &quot;postgraduate&quot; institutions conducting the advance training career commissioned officer programmes. Passing the course of an academy does not result in an explicitly named degree and enables the graduate to proceed to a certain level of command (equivalent of battalion commander and above). Adjunctura is a military analogue of civilian graduate school, which allow commissioned officers to get academic degree of candidate of military sciences and be appointed to teaching and scientific positions in military educational and scientific research institutions.

==Science outreach==
On 1 June 2021, the Federal Law of 5 April 2021 №85-FZ &quot;On Amendments to the Federal Law &#x27;About education in Russian Federation&#x27;&quot; entered into force. This law establishes the concept of the outreach activity: it is the activity, carrying out outside educational programs, which aims to dissemination of a knowledge and an experience, to formation of a skills, a values, and a competence, in order to intellectual, spiritual and moral, creative, physical, and (or) professional development of individual, and to meet educational needs of individual. The manner, conditions and implementation modalities of outreach activity and also the procedure for the control of such activity regulated by Government of Russia. Outreach activity can be carried out by public and local authorities and natural and juridical persons concluded a contracts with educational institutions in the order determined by Government of Russia.

According to scientists, science popularizers, educationalists, lawyers, this law, in fact, establishes the prior censorship of virtually every ways to share knowledge and conviction, contrary to the articles 19 and 29 of the Constitution of Russia.

== Government propaganda ==

On 21 May 2020, &quot;The Moscow Times&quot; reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin made another effort to introduce &quot;patriotic lessons&quot; for Russian students. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government increased their efforts to introduce &quot;patriotic education&quot; into schools. Education Minister Sergey Kravtsov is one of the architects of the &quot;Important Conversations&quot; lessons, which cover various topics from the Russian government&#x27;s perspective, such as national identity, patriotism, traditional values and world events. The Associated Press reported that some parents were shocked by the militaristic nature of &quot;Important Conversations&quot; lessons, with some comparing them to the &quot;patriotic education&quot; of the former Soviet Union. Some Russian students and their parents have been investigated by the police, or threatened with expulsion, for refusing to attend the &quot;Important Conversations&quot; lessons. Putin hosted an inaugural lesson with selected students in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, on 1 September 2022.

<text>Jonathan Stevens Jackson (born May 11, 1982) is an American actor, musician, and author. He is best known for his role as Lucky Spencer in the television soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1993–1999, 2009–2011, 2015, 2024-), which won him five Daytime Emmy Awards. He is also known for his roles in the films &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; (1999), &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; (2002), &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; (2004), and &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot; (2004), as well as the television series &quot;Nashville&quot; (2012–2018), for which he received a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award nomination.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in Orlando, Florida, the son of Jeanine (née Sharp), an amateur ventriloquist and businesswoman, and Dr. Rick &quot;Ricky Lee&quot; Jackson, a family physician, country musician and Congressional candidate in the state of Washington. Jackson was raised in Battle Ground, Washington, with his brother Richard Lee Jackson, now an actor and musician, and his sister Candice Jackson, now a lawyer, an author, and formerly served as an official in the Trump administration as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic Operations and Outreach in the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U.S. Department of Education, the Office&#x27;s Acting Assistant Secretary from April 2017 to July 2018; and the Deputy General Counsel of the Department of Education from July 2018 to January 2021. Jonathan attended Meadow Glade Elementary School.

In 1991, Jackson&#x27;s family took a trip to Universal Studios Hollywood, where both Richard and Jonathan decided to pursue acting. The brothers took acting lessons in nearby Portland, Oregon, before moving part-time to Burbank, California with their mother in 1993.After doing various commercials, within six months Jackson won a role on the ABC Daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Jackson continued his studies as he worked, graduating high school at age 16.

==Career==

===Acting===
Jackson&#x27;s first notable role was Lucky Spencer on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, a role he first played from 1993 to 1999. Jackson won numerous awards for his work as Lucky. He was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series six times, winning first in 1995, and again in 1998 and 1999, making him the record holder for both nominations and wins for the Younger Actor category. He also won Soap Opera Digest Awards in 1995 and 1999. He was nominated for Young Artist Awards in 1996, 1997 and 1999. He won &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s YoungStar Award in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999 and was nominated in 2000. Jackson also became a popular &quot;teen heartthrob&quot; among fans, featured on fan magazines such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; and garnering many fan clubs and internet fansites. In 1999, he was named one of &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 most beautiful people.

While working at &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Jackson starred in his first feature film &quot;Camp Nowhere&quot;, as Morris &quot;Mud&quot; Himmel in 1994. Also during this time he starred in made-for-television films &quot;Prisoner of Zenda, Inc.&quot; and &quot;The Legend of the Ruby Silver&quot;, and made a guest appearance during Season 5 of the ABC sitcom &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;. In 1999, Jackson filmed &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot; shortly before leaving &quot;General Hospital,&quot; starring opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. &quot;Deep End&quot; director Ulu Grosbard spoke of Jackson as &quot;an enormously gifted actor. He brought a weight and a presence and chemistry with Michelle from the beginning. He&#x27;s only 15 years old and he is a very serious actor who has both concentration and humor.&quot; Pfeiffer added, &quot;When Jonathan and I read together, it was like he was my own son. And we just went at each other in only this way that a mother and son could do. His reading was exhilarating.&quot; Jackson was nominated for YoungStar Awards in 1997 for &quot;Prisoner of Zenda, Inc.&quot; and 1999 for &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot;.

In December 1999, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine reported Jackson was likely to be taking on the role of Anakin Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. However, he was soon dropped from the running, and publications speculated the prior publicity had hurt his chances due to creator George Lucas&#x27; preference for privacy. Jackson continued his film career in 2000 with the independent film &quot;True Rights&quot; and the ABC television movie &quot;Trapped in a Purple Haze&quot;. Jackson also wrote and directed a short film with his brother Richard entitled &quot;Crystal Clear&quot;, which won Best Dramatic Short Film and the Coen Brothers Award for Duo-Filmmaking at the Brooklyn Film Festival. In 2002, Jackson played one of his most well-known film roles as Jesse Tuck in &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot;, which he filmed simultaneously with &quot;Insomnia&quot;. In 2004, Jackson filmed &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot;, and &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;. From 2008 through 2009, he had a recurring role as Kyle Reese in the hit Fox TV show &quot;&quot;, playing the father of John Connor before the show was cancelled.

On September 29, 2009, it was announced that Jackson would return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; on October 27 to reprise the role of Lucky Spencer. In 2011, Jackson won his fourth Daytime Emmy and first Outstanding Supporting Actor Award. On November 7, 2011, it was announced that Jackson had decided to leave &quot;General Hospital&quot; and his final airdate was on December 23, 2011. His character is not planned to be recast or killed off, leaving the door open for Jackson to return with the show in the future. In 2012, Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy and second consecutive win for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. 

In 2012, he got the role of singer-songwriter Avery Barkley in the ABC drama &quot;Nashville&quot;. Along with the rest of the cast, Jackson sang and played the guitar himself on the series.

On June 25, 2024, it was announced Jackson would return to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in the summer for a long run.

===Music===

As a child, Jackson took guitar lessons and taught himself to play the piano. Growing up he had an evolving band with various family members. In 2000, the band included his brother, uncle and father and was named &quot;Scarlet Road&quot;. By 2002, Jackson and his brother Richard had named their group &quot;Jono and the Rock&quot;.

The ensemble morphed into Enation, where Jackson is the frontman, playing guitar, vocals and writing most of the songs. Other band members include Jackson&#x27;s brother Richard (drums), and their friend Jonathan Thatcher (bass, previously of Delirious?)

The band has released several albums and their song &quot;Feel This&quot; became a Top 10 hit on the iTunes national Rock Charts after it was featured on the CW television drama series &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. Enation&#x27;s songs have also been featured on &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;, and &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

As well as performing as singer, guitarist &amp; piano Jackson also wrote the song &quot;The Morning of the Rain&quot; featured on episodes 7 and 19 of the first season of &quot;Nashville&quot;. Enation also landed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 10 (&quot;Live From Nashville&quot; DVD, #9) and have garnered numerous radio and TV appearances including live performances on &quot;The View&quot; and VH1&#x27;s &quot;Big Morning Buzz Live&quot;.

In June 2020, Jackson recorded a song dedicated to the Hilandar and Serbian Orthodox monasteries in Kosovo.

===Books===
In the spring of 2012, Jackson released a book of poetry under the name J. S. Jackson, titled &quot;Book of Solace and Madness.&quot; In June 2012, he discussed his yet-to-be-released book entitled &quot;Acting in the Spirit,&quot; which would discuss the connection between his Eastern Orthodox Christian faith and his acting career. In November 2014, Jackson released &quot;The Mystery of Art: Becoming an Artist in the Image of God&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Family===
At age 20, Jackson married former &quot;General Hospital&quot; actress Lisa Vultaggio on June 21, 2002. Jackson told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Some people thought we were a little young to get married. But we didn&#x27;t see the need to wait. When it&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s right.&quot; The couple moved to Jackson&#x27;s hometown of Battle Ground, Washington, to raise their family. They have three children: Caleb (b. June 21, 2003), Adora (b. 2005), and Titus Gabriel (b. October 7, 2010).

===Religion===
The son of Seventh-day Adventist parents, Jackson was raised as a non-denominational Christian and has always been vocal about his faith. As part of his belief system, as a teen Jackson chose not to drink or do drugs. Jackson was also a proponent of abstinence from premarital sex. Jackson also often thanked God during his award acceptance speeches. While Jackson was working on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, he and his family held a home church in Burbank which various cast members attended, including Jackson&#x27;s future wife Lisa Vultaggio. Jackson explained how his beliefs affected his choice of acting roles in an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 1999, &quot;I won&#x27;t get involved with a movie that&#x27;s a direct slap in the face of God. [...] I&#x27;m an actor, so I have to play people who believe differently than me. I would be willing to play a character that was completely unbelieving and anti-God, just as long as that wasn&#x27;t the message of the whole movie.&quot;

In 2002, Jackson participated in the DKNY-sponsored &quot;What&#x27;s Your Anti-Drug?&quot; campaign, posing for the 2003 calendar featured in &quot;Cosmogirl&quot; magazine, stating that his anti-drug was faith. In 2012, Jackson and his family were baptized into the Eastern Orthodox Church. Jackson cited a trip to Romania and Rome that first brought his attention to learning about the history of Christianity. In his acceptance speech for his 2012 Daytime Emmy Award, he thanked the Holy Trinity as well as the monks on Orthodox monastic enclave Mount Athos. Jackson later explained in an interview, &quot;These people [are] dedicating their lives to prayer, and not just praying for themselves, but truly praying for all of us. And then the thought kind of crossed my mind: with all the destruction, chaos and insanity that goes on in this world, if their prayers weren&#x27;t happening, what would this world be like? I felt, personally, like I just wanted to thank them because I really believe that their prayers mean a lot.&quot;

As of September 18, 2020, &quot;OrthoChristian.com&quot; reports that Jackson had moved to Ireland to help support a new monastery being founded by the Romanian Orthodox Metropolis of Southern and Western Europe. He explains in the interview, &quot;It’s the main reason I moved, I have been praying for years for an Orthodox monastery to be founded in Ireland.&quot;

At the September 28, 2024, annual conference of the Shakespeare Oxford Fellowship he presented The Moral and Spiritual Vision of Edward DeVere, in which he suggests that Greek Orthodox Christianity has much in common with Devere&#x27;s spiritual vision as seen in his letters, poetry, and the works of Shakespeare. In particular he explores the alignment of the thought of John Chrysostom and Baldassare Castiglione with DeVere&#x27;s faith.

<text>Daniel Pauly is a French-born marine biologist, well known for his work in studying human impacts on global fisheries and in 2020 was the most cited fisheries scientist in the world. He is a professor and the project leader of the Sea Around Us initiative at the Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia. He also served as Director of the UBC Fisheries Centre from November 2003 to October 2008.

In February 2023 Pauly was the co-recipient of the 2023 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, with Ussif Rashid Sumaila. The award has been described as the ‘Nobel Prize for the Environment.’

== Biography ==
Pauly was born in Paris, France. He grew up, however, in La Chaux de Fonds, Switzerland in what was called a strange &quot;Dickensian&quot; childhood where he was forced to stay as a live-in servant to a new family. For the first 16 years of his life, Pauly lived an inward life as he was mixed race in an all-white town, finding solace in books/reading and model construction. At 16 he ran away and put himself through high school in Wuppertal, Germany after one year working with disabled people for a local church-run institution. His work led to a scholarship to the University of Kiel.

It was at the University of Kiel where Pauly decided on fisheries biology. He said he wanted to work in the tropics because he felt that he would &quot;fit in&quot; better there. He also wanted to devote his life to an applied job where he could help people.

He did a master&#x27;s degree at Kiel University at Gotthilf Hempel lab on &quot;The ecology and fishery of a small West African lagoon&quot;. Pauly then spent two years conducting trawling surveys as a member of a German-Indonesian project aiming at introducing this relatively new gear. He began to write on tropical fisheries management; later his emphasis switched to global fisheries trends and conservation.

Pauly completed his Ph.D. at Kiel University in Germany supervised by Hempel, in which he established strong relationships between the surface area of gills and the growth of fishes and aquatic (gill-breathing) invertebrates. His dissertation laid the foundation for his Gill-Oxygen Limitation Theory, which he would later develop in more detail.
After his Ph.D., Pauly worked for 15 years at the &quot;International Center for Living and Aquatic Resources Management&quot; (ICLARM), in Manila, Philippines. Early in his career at ICLARM, Pauly worked in the tropics and developed new methods for estimating fish populations. Pauly helped to design, implement, and perfect methods using length-frequency data instead of the age of fish to estimate parameters of fisheries statistics such as growth and mortality.

Later, he helped develop two major projects: ELEFAN and FishBase. ELEFAN (ELectronic Length Frequency ANalysis) made it possible to use length-frequency data to estimate the growth and mortality of fishes. FishBase is an online encyclopedia of fish and fisheries information comprising information on more than 30,000 different species. Both projects received worldwide attention and through multiple upgrades and additions, are still prominent in fisheries biology.

Through the 1990s, Pauly’s work centered on the effects of overfishing. The author of several books and more than 500 scientific papers, Pauly is a prolific writer and communicator. He developed the concept of shifting baselines in 1995 and authored the seminal paper, Fishing down marine food webs, in 1998. For working to protect the environment, he earned a place in the &quot;Scientific American 50&quot; in 2003, the same year &quot;The New York Times&quot; labeled him an &quot;iconoclast&quot;. Pauly won the International Cosmos Prize in 2005, the Volvo Environment Prize in 2006, the Excellence in Ecology Prize and Ted Danson Ocean Hero Award in 2007, the Ramon Margalef Prize in Ecology and Environmental Sciences in 2008, and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2012. In 2015, Pauly received the Peter Benchley Ocean Award for Excellence in Science. In 2016, he was honored in Paris with the Albert Ier Grand Medal in the Science category. In 2017, he received, together with Dirk Zeller as part of the &quot;Sea Around Us&quot; leading team, the Ocean Award in the Science category.

Also in 2017 and specifically on French National Day, he was named Chevalier de la Légion D’Honneur.

Pauly has written several books, including &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Fishes&quot; (Cambridge University Press), &quot;Five Easy Pieces: How Fishing Impacts Marine Ecosystems&quot; (Island Press) and &quot;Gasping Fish and Panting Squids: Oxygen, Temperature and the Growth of Water-Breathing Animals.&quot;

== Views ==
To date, he frequently expresses opinions about public policy. Specifically, he argues that governments should abolish subsidies to fishing fleets and establish marine reserves. He is a member of the Board of Oceana. In a 2009 article written for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Pauly compares today&#x27;s fisheries to a global Ponzi scheme.

<doc id="674917" wikidata="Q3303481" url="?curid=674917" title="Cinnamon Toast Crunch">
<text>Cinnamon Toast Crunch (CTC), known as Croque-Cannelle in French Canada and Curiously Cinnamon in the UK (previously Cinnamon Grahams), and as a variant called Cini Minis in other European and Latin American countries, is a brand of breakfast cereal produced by General Mills in the United States and Cereal Partners under the Nestlé brand in other countries. First produced in 1984, the cereal aims to provide the taste of cinnamon toast in a crunch cereal format. The cereal consists of small squares or rectangles of wheat and rice covered with cinnamon and sugar. The cereal is puffed and when immersed in milk, it makes a &quot;snap&quot; noise, similar to Rice Krispies. In most European countries and North America, the product is sold in boxes, but in Poland, Slovakia and Russia the cereal is sold in bags. The product was originally marketed outside Europe with the mascot of a jolly baker named Wendell. Wendell was replaced as a mascot by the &quot;Crazy Squares&quot;, sentient Cinnamon Toast Crunch squares that often eat each other in commercials. The Crazy Squares were replaced by the similar-looking 2D &quot;Cinnamojis&quot; in the US in 2020, the Crazy Squares are still used in the United Kingdom.

==Histor==

===United States===
Originally, the cereal was plain squares but currently features cinnamon-colored swirling on each piece. It was invented by scientist John Mendesh and General Mills assistant product manager Elisabeth Trach after receiving the idea from an unnamed child in a &quot;give us your best idea for a cereal&quot; radio contest held by General Mills. The child received a set of Hot Wheels toys as a grand prize. Starting in 1985 there were three animated bakers as the mascots, one of which is named Wendell. The other two bakers, known as Bob and Quello, were considerably more youthful in appearance than Wendell. In 1991, the younger bakers were dropped, leaving Wendell as the sole mascot for several years until 2013.

===United Kingdom===
The product was first introduced to the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1998 by Cereal Partners, as Cinnamon Toast Crunch, the same name as the popular North American cereal brand. The name was later changed to Cinnamon Grahams, similar to Golden Grahams, another Nestlé product. The name was once again changed to its current name of Curiously Cinnamon, produced by Cereal Partners under the Nestlé brand.

==Description==

Cinnamon Toast Crunch consists of whole grain wheat and rice squares, which are then coated with a blend of cinnamon and sugar, and fortified with various vitamins and minerals.

One serving of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, equal to ¾ cup (177 mL) or 31 g, has 130 calories (544 kJ), or 170 calories (711 kJ) with ½ cup (118 mL) of skim milk. A single serving has 3 g of total fat, no cholesterol, 220 mg of sodium, and 45 mg of potassium. One serving has 25 g of total carbohydrates with 2 g of dietary fiber and 9 g of sugars with 14 g of other carbohydrates. A single serving also contains 1 g of protein. Cinnamon Toast Crunch was reformulated in an industry-led sugar reduction effort in 2012. The original formulation contained 10 grams per 3/4 cup serving, while the 2012 reformulation (still current ) contains 9 grams sugar per 3/4 cup serving.

==Marketing==
Originally, the three bakers were the mascots and the cereal did not have a slogan. Starting in 1995, it was given the slogan, &quot;The taste you can see.&quot; In 2007, Cinnamon Toast Crunch experimented with a new slogan, &quot;It&#x27;s That Intense&quot;, but switched back after poor reception. In 2009, the slogan became &quot;Crave those crazy squares&quot;. In 2019, the slogan changed to either &quot;Unlock the Cinnaverse&quot; or &quot;Blasted With Cinna-Dust&quot;

In 1997, appealing to adult-oriented programming, a campaign featured the slogan &quot;The adult thing to do&quot;, mostly centering on &quot;adult&quot; things reverting to children&#x27;s, including cereal (for instance, a fictional &quot;adult&quot; cereal named &quot;Health Pellets&quot; is replaced with Cinnamon Toast Crunch). This was changed in 2004 to &quot;Breakfast on a whole other level&quot;, which was replaced with &quot;Crave those crazy squares&quot; in 2009.

==Spin-offs==
There have been at least five offshoots of the cereal:
* &quot;Chocolate Toast Crunch&quot;
* &quot;French Toast Crunch&quot; in 1995 and again in 2015
* &quot;Peanut Butter Toast Crunch&quot; in 2004 and 2013
* &quot;Frosted Toast Crunch&quot; in 2012
* &quot;Sugar Cookie Toast Crunch&quot; for the 2014 holiday season, 2015, 2018, 2023
* &quot;Dulce de Leche Toast Crunch&quot;, 2021
* &quot;Apple Pie Toast Crunch&quot;, 2021
* &quot;Lucky Charms Cinnamon Toast Crunch Mix&quot;, 2022
* Tres Leches Toast Crunch (2023)

French Toast Crunch is shaped like many little French toast slices, reminiscent of the style of Cookie Crisp. It was discontinued in 2006, but made a return in 2015 due to its cult popularity among its fans. Peanut Butter Toast Crunch was a cereal consisting of flakes similar but darker to Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Frosted Toast Crunch resembles Cinnamon Toast Crunch with vanilla coating. This cereal was discontinued by 2006. As another offshoot, Monopoly Cereal was a limited edition product created in April 2003 by General Mills. The cereal was like Cinnamon Toast Crunch but with the addition of marshmallows based on the pieces in the Monopoly game, such as houses and hotels. Sugar Cookie Toast Crunch was like Cinnamon Toast Crunch except with a sugar cookie taste.

In Germany, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Israel, and Poland where a variant of the cereal is known as &quot;Cini Minis&quot;, a strawberry flavoured variant named Erdbeer Minis/Strawberry Minis exists. In Germany and Austria it replaced a previously existing apple flavoured variant called Äpple Minis. This strawberry flavoured variant was later released in the UK as Curiously Strawberry.

In 2018, Cinnamon Toast Crunch Churros were introduced. The cereal has the same cinnamon sugar flavor as the original but is shaped like a mini churro. A chocolate version soon followed, and was introduced in 2021 to the UK as Curiously Cinnamon Churros.

==Shrimp tail contamination incident==
On March 22, 2021, American writer, rapper and podcaster Jensen Karp found what appeared to be discarded shrimp tails in his Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal; his tweets about the incident went viral. Additionally, Karp found a piece of string, &quot;small black pieces&quot; embedded into some pieces of the cereal, and an object which looked like a pea. General Mills then issued a statement on Twitter claiming the tails were &quot;an accumulation of the cinnamon sugar that sometimes can occur when ingredients aren&#x27;t thoroughly blended&quot;. General Mills later claimed they were investigating the case, but that contamination &quot;did not occur at [their] facility&quot;.

The incident was covered internationally by multiple major news outlets, who were critical of the company&#x27;s response.

<text>A singing game is an activity based on a particular verse or rhyme, usually associated with a set of actions and movements. As a collection, they have been studied by folklorists, ethnologists, and psychologists and are seen as important part of childhood culture. The same term is also used for a form of video game that involves singing.

==The study of singing games==
Singing games began to be recorded and studied seriously in the nineteenth century as part of the wider folklore movement. Joseph Strutt&#x27;s &quot;Sports and Pastimes of the People of England&quot; (1801), Robert Chambers’s &quot;Popular Rhymes of Scotland&quot; (1826), James Orchard Halliwell&#x27;s &quot;The Nursery Rhymes of England&quot; (1842) and &quot;Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales&quot; (1849), and G. F. Northal&#x27;s &quot;English Folk Rhymes&quot; (1892) all included singing games. However, the first studies to focus solely on this area were William Wells Newell&#x27;s &quot;Games and Songs of American Children&quot; (1883) and Alice Gomme&#x27;s &quot;The Traditional Games of England, Scotland, and Ireland&quot; (1894-8). Both were considered landmark works in studies conducted on respective sides of the Atlantic. Naturally, these studies tended to include many of the faults associated with the gathering of folklore and folk song examples in the eras studied. They have been criticised for focusing on rural society at the expense of urban, and an obsession with recovering what they considered “authentic” and original, but “disappearing,” verse from adults while disregarding contemporary practice by children. Some of these problems were rectified by the work of Norman Douglas, who produced &quot;London Street Games&quot; in 1916, focusing on the urban working classes.

Perhaps still the most significant works in the field are that of Iona and Peter Opie, who departed from previous practice in Britain; following work by Dorothy Howard in America and Brian Sutton-Smith in New Zealand, they relied on detailed observation of children for their evidence. This resulted in the couples’ works &quot;The Language and Lore of Schoolchildren&quot; (1959), &quot;Children&#x27;s Games in Street and Playground&quot; (1969), and &quot;The Singing Game&quot; (1985). Their extensive studies refuted the idea that the traditions of singing games were disappearing in the face of social and media change, and instead suggested adaptation as well as primary development. Their work was highly influential, and efforts were made to replicate it in a number of locations, including America, where Herbert and Mary Knapp produced &quot;One Potato, Two Potato: the Secret Education of American Children&quot; (1976) and Finland which saw &#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Lore&quot; (1978). Wider anthropological-based studies include Helen Schwartzman&#x27;s &quot;Transformations: The Anthropology of Children&#x27;s Play&quot; (1978).

As investigational evidence changed, so did the methods of recording. Early folklorists like Lady Gomme tended to provide written descriptions of games, lyrics, and occasionally musical notation of tunes. In time, complex symbols were developed to choreograph the body’s movements within the games, but from the late 1970s on there was increasing use of ethnographic film to record the actual practice of games, providing a record of the links between movement and music.

==Origins of singing games==
Early folklorists tended to reflect contemporary theories and beliefs, including the view that singing games were a form of pagan survivalism, which led Alice Gomme to conclude that &quot;London Bridge Is Broken Down&quot; reflected a memory of child sacrifice, or &#x27;devolution&#x27;, which assumed that children&#x27;s songs must have devolved down to children from adult culture and did not allow for innovation by children themselves. The origins of most are obscure and have been evolved by children over many generations.

==Types of games==
The Opies divided singing games into a number of categories, including:
*Matchmaking 
*Wedding Rings 
*Cushion Dances 
*Witch Dances
*Calls of Friendship 
*Eccentric Circles 
*Buffoonery 
*Clapping
*Mimicry

===Starting songs===
Many other children&#x27;s games, that do not themselves involve singing are prefaced by a song. Traditionally there were many calling rhymes, used to assemble players of a game, which is probably the origin of the nursery rhyme &quot;Girls and Boys Come Out To Play&quot;. Singing games are often used as counting out or &#x27;dipping&#x27; games, a means of starting a game by choosing special roles, usually by eliminating all but one player, most famously in rhymes like &quot;Eeny, meeny, miny, moe&quot; and &quot;One potato, two potato&quot;.

===Circle dances===

Some children&#x27;s singing games may have their origins in circle dances, including &quot;Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush&quot;. The simplest, and perhaps the best known, circle dance is &quot;Ring a Ring o&#x27; Roses&quot;.

===Courtship and marriage games===
A number of singing games deal with elements of courtship and marriage, like &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot;, which remained also an adult courtship song, and &quot;Green Grass&quot; and &quot;Three Dukes&quot;, which was largely retained only by children. Perhaps the best known of wedding ring games, where players are chosen for various roles in married life, from a circle is &quot;The Farmer in the Dell&quot;.

===Clapping games===

A clapping game is usually played by two players and involves clapping as accompaniment to a rhyme. Clapping games are found throughout the world and similar games may be known throughout large areas with regional variations. The rhyme helps the players carry out the codas in time.

===Skipping rhymes===

A skipping or jump-rope rhyme, is a form of singing game chanted while using skipping ropes. Such rhymes have been recorded in all cultures where skipping is played. Examples of English-language rhymes have been found going back to at least the seventeenth century. Like most folklore, skipping rhymes tend to be found in many different variations.

===&quot;Catching&quot; games===
In this game, two players make an arch while the others pass through in single file while singing a song. The arch is then lowered at the end of the song to &quot;catch&quot; a player. Perhaps the most common example of such a game involves the song &quot;London Bridge is Falling Down.&quot; A similar game is played to the tune of &quot;Oranges and Lemons.&quot; Similar games exist in other cultures as well. In Japan, for example, similar games are played to the song &quot;Toryanse.&quot; In Mexico, the game is played to the song &quot;La Vibora de La Mar.&quot;

==The role of games==
A variety of roles have been attributed to singing games, including exploring language, allowing acceptable criticism and to regularise and ritualise play and other behaviour. Most singing games tend to be co-operative rather than competitive and communal rather than hierarchical.

==Debates over decline==
From the eighteenth century it has been argued that the culture of singing games is dying out. There is evidence that street games in many European and North American regions are disappearing as children play less in &#x27;unsafe&#x27; traffic-filled roads, and simple games compete with the rise of television, video games and other pastimes; however, detailed observations indicate that they still thrive in the playground. There is evidence that age range has narrowed, with adolescents almost totally abandoning them and the &#x27;guardianship&#x27; of games being left to those aged six to ten years old. Recently Iona Opie has noted that singing games in Britain have become virtually the preserve of girls.

==Video games==

Singing video games pit multiple players against each other, or a single player against previous performances or a set standard. Objectives might include subjectively rated creativity, adherence to a theme, ability to mimic another performer, or objectively rated pitch and note duration. Examples include &quot;Karaoke Revolution&quot;, released by Konami, which measures a player&#x27;s pitch and gives a score based on the player&#x27;s ability to maintain the proper pitch and duration for each note while singing along with a song whose lyrics are displayed on the screen. High scores are saved, so players can compete against each other or previous scores.

<text>Donald O&#x27;Riley Quarrie CD (born 25 February 1951) is a Jamaican former track and field athlete, one of the world&#x27;s top sprinters during the 1970s. At the 1976 Summer Olympics he was the gold medallist in the Olympic 200 meters and silver medallist in the Olympic 100 meters. In all, he competed in five Olympic Games and won four Olympic medals during his career.

He nearly equalled the 200 meters world record in 1971, coming within .03 seconds of the time set by Tommie Smith in 1968. He has a personal best of 19.86 seconds set in Cali, Colombia on 3 August 1971. As of 2024, this remains the track record.

He won 100 metres/200 metres sprint doubles at the 1970 Commonwealth Games, 1971 Pan American Games, and 1974 Commonwealth Games. He was the first male to defend either the 100 m or 200 m title at the Commonwealth Games and a 100 m win at the 1978 Commonwealth Games makes him the only person to have won that title three times. He won nine gold medals in the sprints at the Central American and Caribbean Championships in Athletics from 1971 to 1981.

He has received recognition both on and off the field. He was a five-time winner at the Jamaican Sportsperson of the Year and a statue of him is positioned at the entrance to Jamaica&#x27;s National Stadium. There is also a school (Donald Quarrie High School) that bears his name in Eastern Kingston. Reggae artists have paid respect to his achievements with songs including &quot;Tribute to Donald Quarrie&quot;, one by Joe Gibbs and The Guerrillas and one by Bongo Herman.

==Athletics career==
Quarrie made the Jamaican 100 m team for the 1968 Summer Olympics as a 17-year-old, but he injured himself in training, and could not take part. He moved to the United States and attended the University of Nebraska and later the University of Southern California, where he graduated with a degree in Business and Public Administration. There, his sprinting capabilities gradually increased. At the 1970 Commonwealth Games, Quarrie won the gold medal in both the 100 and 200 m, surprising his more experienced competitors. Anchoring the Jamaican 4 × 100 m relay team, he pocketed a third Commonwealth title.

Quarrie repeated his sprint double the following year at the Pan American Games in Cali and his time in the 200 meters was a hand-timed 19.8. One of the favourites for the upcoming Munich Olympics, Quarrie again suffered from injuries at the Olympic Games. He did compete in the 200 m but had to abandon his 200 m semi-final after pulling a muscle.

In 1974 Quarrie repeated his 1970 performance by grabbing the 100 and 200 m titles at the Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, becoming the first athlete to retain the title in either event. The next season, he again tied the 200 m world record, 19.8. He also tied the 100 m record with a hand-timed mark (9.9) in 1976 at the California Relays at Modesto Junior College, one of only a few athletes to have held these records simultaneously. This time was actually 10.07 seconds.

In 1976 after winning the AAA&#x27;s 100/200 titles Quarrie could finally compete at the Olympics without injuries. He first made the 100 m final, which he led until overtaken by Trinidadian Hasely Crawford. In the 200 m Quarrie led the pack coming out of the turn and held off all challenges to take the title in 20.22.

At the 1978 Commonwealth Games he won his third consecutive 100 m title but was eliminated in the 200 m after a cramp attack. Quarrie&#x27;s participation in his fourth Olympics in Moscow was in doubt after he was involved in a car crash the previous year. He recovered in time to compete but was eliminated in the 100 m semi-finals. His title defense failed in the 200 m but he did make the final and finished third, adding a bronze medal to his collection.

By 1984 Quarrie was no longer among the world&#x27;s best in the individual sprint events and it was therefore no surprise he was eliminated in the heats of the 200 m event at the Los Angeles Olympics. However, he won a fourth Olympic medal with the Jamaican 4x100 m relay team, which finished second behind the United States. His final competitive race was a 200m in London in September 1984, in which he finished 3rd.

As a youth, Bradley played in the 1978 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Kitchener, Ontario.

Brian Bradley&#x27;s NHL debut came in the 1985–86 season with the Calgary Flames, where he saw very limited action (only 5 regular season games and one playoff game), although his first playoff game was during the 1986 Stanley Cup Finals against the Montreal Canadiens. He would spend most of the season with the Moncton Golden Flames (Calgary&#x27;s minor league team), where he was linemates with future superstar Brett Hull.

In 1988, after arriving back from playing with Canadian National Men&#x27;s Hockey Team, where he spent most of the 1986–87 NHL season playing, Bradley was traded to the Vancouver Canucks. During the 1989 playoffs, Bradley would tie rookie Trevor Linden with a team-leading 7 points in seven games. His best regular season totals with the Canucks came in the 1989–90 season when he scored a team respectable 48 points and was awarded The Canucks&#x27; &quot;Most Exciting Player Award&quot; by Canuck fans. He started out the 1990–91 season playing strongly, only to be traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs for mobile defenceman Tom Kurvers.

In 1992, the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning acquired him in the 1992 NHL Expansion Draft, and he would become the team&#x27;s first star. He would score the team&#x27;s first preseason goal against the Minnesota North Stars. He would set personal highs in goals, assists and points before the All-Star Break. At the end of Tampa Bay&#x27;s inaugural season, Bradley led the team with a career high 42 goals and 86 points. He played well enough throughout the season that he also made his NHL All-Star debut. In 1995–96 he set a personal high of 56 assists. That same year the Lightning debuted in the NHL playoffs. The next season (1996–97) Brian Bradley would score the first goal in the history of the Ice Palace arena. Unfortunately, he would be sidelined for most of the 1997-98 season due to a concussion. He would remain with the Lightning until retiring due to chronic injuries on September 23, 1999.

==Post-hockey life==
Bradley is still affiliated with the Lightning&#x27;s organization and makes frequent appearances on Bally Sports Sun television, which broadcasts regular season Lightning games.

On March 29, 2017, Bradley was inducted into the Sports Club of Tampa Bay Hall of Fame as part of the Hall&#x27;s 34th class. Bradley became the third member of the Lightning organization to be inducted. This is Bradley&#x27;s second hall of fame induction in that he is also a member of the Waterloo Region Hall of Fame in his hometown of Kitchener, Ontario.

<text>Cynthia Michele Watros (born September 2, 1968) is an American actress recognized for her roles in both daytime and primetime television. In 1994, she was cast in the regular role of Annie Dutton on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, which earned her the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1998. In 2002, she was cast as Kellie on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot; and in 2005 joined the cast of &quot;Lost&quot; as Libby Smith. Since 2019, Watros has portrayed the role of Nina Reeves on ABC&#x27;s &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

==Early life==
Watros was born in Lake Orion, Michigan. She attended Macomb Community College in Clinton Township, Michigan, and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theatre from Boston University, where she was part of the Professional Actors Training Program.

==Career==
Watros initially became known for her role as Annie Dutton on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; from 1994 to 1998. Her character, a nurse, began as a heroine, but she gained notice and critical acclaim as her character gradually descended into madness. In 1998, Watros won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her role on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. In 1998, she briefly filled in for Jensen Buchanan as Victoria Hudson McKinnon on &quot;Another World&quot; while Buchanan was on maternity leave.

Watros appeared as Erin Fitzpatrick on &quot;Titus&quot; from 2000 to 2002 and gained recognition as a comedic actress, playing the fiancée of the title character. According to the DVD commentary, Erin was intended to be neurotic and socially awkward, but the character was revised a week before the pilot was shot. After &quot;Titus&quot; was canceled, she took on the role of Kellie Newmark on &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, as a replacement for Christa Miller. Watros played the role from 2002 to 2004.

From 2005 to 2006, Watros was a cast member on the ABC series &quot;Lost&quot;, playing psychologist Libby, a member of the &quot;Tailies&quot;, a group of survivors of the plane crash who were in the tail section of the plane (and not seen during Season One). She was a romantic interest to Hurley and was very mysterious showing up in flashbacks.

After her departure from &quot;Lost&quot; in 2006, Watros filmed a pilot for a show titled &quot;My Ex-Life&quot; for CBS. She was slated to play the ex-wife of a character played by Tom Cavanagh. However, the pilot was not chosen by CBS. Watros was also the lead in the 2007 CBS television pilot for &quot;The Rich Inner Life of Penelope Cloud&quot;, a comedy about a former literary genius who, after an awakening, decides to pursue optimism instead of cynicism.

In 2009, Watros filmed a pilot for &quot;Valley Girls&quot;, a spin-off of the CW series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; set in the 1980s, in which she played CeCe Rhodes, the socialite ex-wife of Rick Rhodes, and mother of the series&#x27; protagonists. In a May 2009 episode of the USA series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;, &quot;A Stand-Up Triple&quot;, she guest starred as a mother of three children in the witness protection program. Beginning in April 2010, Watros joined the cast of the TV medical drama &quot;House&quot; for seven episodes as Samantha Carr, one of Dr. James Wilson&#x27;s ex-wives.

Watros appeared in the 2012 indie film, &quot;Electrick Children&quot;. In May 2012, she guest-starred in episode 8.22 of &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. In June 2013, she guest-starred in episode 4.17 of &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;. She played Mary Matrix, coach of the FPS Varsity team in the online series &quot;Video Game High School&quot;. Her character first appears in season two of the series, which started July 2013. Watros starred as Avery Jenning&#x27;s self-obsessed aunt in &quot;Dog with a Blog&quot; on December 6, 2013.

In 2013, Watros joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, but left the show in early 2014; the character was recast. In July 2014, she joined the cast of the MTV series &quot;Finding Carter&quot;.

In 2019, Watros joined the cast of &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Nina Reeves, taking over the role from actress Michelle Stafford, who departed the role to return to the CBS soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;. 

Watros also made a guest appearance in the digital drama series &quot;Misguided&quot;, playing a waitress named Anne, a nod to her role as Annie Dutton on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;.

==Personal life==
 Watros was married to Curtis Gilliland from 1996 to 2020. They have twin daughters, born in 2001.

In 2005, Watros was arrested in Kailua for allegedly driving under the influence of an intoxicant.

In 2008, Watros participated in a USO tour to Iraq, visiting several bases, including COP Callahan in Baghdad&#x27;s East Adamiyah area.

<doc id="674934" wikidata="Q7812185" url="?curid=674934" title="Today (UK newspaper)">
<text>Today was a national newspaper in the United Kingdom that was published between 1986 and 1995.

==History==
&quot;Today&quot;, with the American newspaper &quot;USA Today&quot; as an inspiration, launched on Tuesday 4 March 1986, with the front-page headline, &quot;Second Spy Inside GCHQ&quot;. At 18p (equivalent to p in ), it was a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Express&quot;. It pioneered computer photo-typesetting and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines, letterpress and could only reproduce photographs in black and white. The colour was initially crude, produced on equipment which had no facility for colour proofing, so the first view of the colour was on the finished product. However, it forced the conversion of all UK national newspapers to electronic production and colour printing. The newspaper&#x27;s motto, hung in the newsroom, was &quot;propa truth, not propaganda&quot;.

Launched by regional newspaper entrepreneur Eddy Shah, it was bought by Tiny Rowland&#x27;s conglomerate Lonrho within four months. Shah subsequently launched the short-lived, unsuccessful national tabloid &quot;The Post&quot; in 1988. Alastair Campbell was political editor and his girlfriend, Fiona Millar, was news editor.

Alongside the daily newspaper, a Sunday edition was launched. &quot;Sunday Today&quot; suffered from having three editors in less than a year, and was closed early in 1987 as a cost-saving measure.

The newspaper began a sponsorship of the English Football League at the start of 1986–87, but withdrew after a season. &quot;Today&quot; was sold to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International in 1987. &quot;Today&quot; was based in 70 Vauxhall Bridge Road, Pimlico, London, prior to moving to Wapping.

&quot;Today&quot; ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot; in 1971. The last edition&#x27;s headline was &#x27;Goodbye, it&#x27;s been great to know you&quot;. The editorial said: &quot;Now we are forced into silence by the granite and unforgiving face of the balance sheet&quot;.

Richard Stott was editor when &quot;Today&quot; ceased publication. Other journalists at the close included Peter Prendergast (city editor), Anne Robinson (columnist), Barry Wigmore (US editor, based in New York), Olga Craig, Chris Hutchins, David McMaster (managing editor) and the MP Tony Banks (football correspondent).

==Controversies==
In the immediate aftermath of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the paper showed a fireman carrying the body of a young girl under the headline &quot;In the name of Islam&quot;, however it was found that the bombing had been perpetrated by two anti-government white supremacists.

In 1996, Hugh Grant won damages from News UK over what his lawyers called a &quot;highly defamatory&quot; article in January 1995. The newspaper had falsely claimed that Grant verbally abused a young extra with a &quot;foul-mouthed tongue lashing&quot; on the set of &quot;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Florida&quot; was an &quot;Arkansas&quot;-class monitor in the United States Navy.

&quot;Florida&quot; was ordered on 4 May 1898, and awarded to the Crescent Shipyard, Elizabethport, New Jersey, on 11 October 1898. She was laid down 23 January 1899 and launched 30 November 1901 by Lewis Nixon and Arthur Leopold Busch, a marine engineer who worked at the Crescent Shipyard; sponsored by Miss S. Wood; and commissioned 18 June 1903, with Commander John Charles Frémont Jr., in command. The total cost for the hull, machinery, armor and armament was $1,508,881.84.

So that her name could be used for a new battleship, &quot;Florida&quot; was renamed Tallahassee in 1908 and was later assigned the hull number BM-9 in 1920. She was reclassified as IX-16 in 1921 and sold for scrap the following year.

==Design==
The s had been designed to combine a heavy striking power with easy concealment and negligible target area. They had a displacement of , measured in overall length, with a beam of and a draft of . She was manned by a total crew of 13 officers and 209 men.

&quot;Florida&quot; was powered by two vertical triple expansion engines driving two screw propellers with steam generated by four Mosher fire-tube boilers. The engines in &quot;Florida&quot; were designed to produce with a top speed of , however, on sea trials she was only able to produce with a top speed of . &quot;Florida&quot; was designed to provide a range of at .

The ship was armed with a main battery of two /40 caliber guns, either Mark 3 or Mark 4, in a Mark 4 turret. The secondary battery consisted of four /50 caliber Mark 7 guns along with three 6-pounder guns. The main belt armor was in the middle tapering to at the ends. The gun turrets were between , with barbettes. &quot;Florida&quot; also had a deck.

== Service history ==

Serving with the Coast Squadron, &quot;Florida&quot; trained midshipmen on summer cruises, and operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean waters. She participated in the Presidential Naval Review in Oyster Bay, Long Island, held by Theodore Roosevelt on 3 September 1906, and four days later reported to the Naval Academy for regular service as a practice ship. She was placed in reserve 11 September 1906, but returned to full commission between 7 June and 30 August 1907, for a midshipman cruise, and between 21 May and 19 June 1908 for participation in ordnance experiments. These included testing the then-new superfire concept where turrets were mounted in line with one turret elevated to fire over the other.

On 1 July 1908, &quot;Florida&quot; was renamed USS &quot;Tallahassee&quot; to free the state name for assignment to a battleship. On 1 August 1910, she was placed in commission in reserve and began a regular schedule of ordnance experimentation and occasional duty in the Panama Canal Zone and Norfolk area as a submarine tender. During World War I she served as submarine tender in the Canal Zone, the Virgin Islands, and Bermuda areas and on 30 September 1919, entered Charleston Navy Yard where she was decommissioned on 3 December 1919. &quot;Tallahassee&quot; was assigned to the 6th Naval District as a reserve training ship from 19 February 1920, serving in commissioned status from 3 September 1920 to 24 March 1922.

&quot;Tallahassee&quot; was redesignated as IX-16 on 20 July 1921, and decommissioned for the final time on 24 March 1922. She was sold on 25 July 1922, to Ammunition Products Corporation, of Washington, D.C.

<text>Anavyssos () is a town and a former municipality in East Attica, Greece located in the Athens Riviera. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Saronikos, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 14.478 km2. At the 2021 census it had 6,180 inhabitants.

<doc id="674939" wikidata="Q6698012" url="?curid=674939" title="Lucky Spencer">
<text>Lucky Spencer is a fictional character from the ABC Daytime soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He is the son of Luke (Anthony Geary) and Laura Spencer (Genie Francis). His birth having been announced on-screen in 1985, a ten-year-old Lucky was cast in 1993, played by newcomer at the time, Jonathan Jackson. Jackson left the series in 1999, and the character was played by Jacob Young and later Greg Vaughan, who was let go in 2009 to allow Jackson to reprise the role. Lucky&#x27;s characterization changed throughout the different portrayers; originally a street-smart con artist, Lucky develops an edge during Young&#x27;s tenure and more drastically changes during Vaughan&#x27;s portrayal, as Lucky becomes a struggling police officer. With Jackson&#x27;s reprisal, Lucky begins showing some of the character&#x27;s original quick-witted qualities, but after a series of harrowing storylines, Jackson left the series in December 2011 and the role was not recast. Jackson briefly reprised the role in July 2015, and full-time in 2024. Guy Wilson appeared in several episodes as Lucky in February 2025 when Jackson was unavailable.

As a child, Lucky is known for taking part in the adventures of his parents. As a teenager, he becomes part of the supercouple Lucky Spencer and Elizabeth Webber (played by Rebecca Herbst) while Lucky helps Elizabeth recover after she has been raped. He learns of his parents&#x27; rape incident decades prior, exacerbating his rebellion and independence. Lucky is kidnapped and presumed dead in 1999, and returns brainwashed in 2000. He becomes a police officer in 2003, and faces financial and marital struggles during the following years, as well as prescription drug abuse. Lucky faces a series of tragic events starting in 2010, including Elizabeth&#x27;s affair with his brother Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher), the death of his legal son Jacob Spencer, his father&#x27;s alcoholism, the death of his wife Siobhan McKenna (Erin Chambers) and his own relapse into drug addiction.

Lucky&#x27;s teenage story arcs had social impact; viewers praised the recovery of Elizabeth&#x27;s rape as helping other victims to heal, and the couple&#x27;s innocent relationship aimed to show the option of sexual abstinence to younger viewers. Jackson received numerous accolades for his portrayal of Lucky, including five Daytime Emmy Awards. Young also received a Daytime Emmy Award, while Vaughan was the only portrayer of Lucky to never receive an Emmy nomination.

==Casting==

The role was originated on October 29, 1993, by eleven-year-old Jonathan Jackson. Rumors circulated that Jackson’s contract negotiations were not going well in 1996, and again in 1998, when Jackson responded that he was considering college and had given the series six months notice of his consideration in accordance with his contract. In January 1999, it was reported that the series had worked out a deal, and Jackson stated he had briefly extended his contract to allow the character&#x27;s popular romance to continue. His contract allowed him to leave if he received a feature film role, and Jackson left in April, shooting pre-taped scenes that appeared through late May. Jackson explained to &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;: &quot;I kind of feel that the fact of how much work they&#x27;ve given me this year, at this stage as an actor, they just maxed out quite a bit of what I would do for the show. And I&#x27;m at a better age now to go out. There are more projects for people my age or a little older than there were a few years ago. Hollywood&#x27;s the kind of town where you kinda have to strike while the iron&#x27;s hot.&quot; Jackson&#x27;s manager Tony Monziotti released the statement: &quot;[Jackson] has told &quot;GH&quot; and made it very clear to me that he wants to periodically go back to &quot;GH&quot;. It&#x27;s a question of if the storyline warrants it and they want him to come back; Jonathan would be more than happy to.&quot; In early 2000, Jackson stated he would enjoy reprising the role but his schedule would not allow it. He suggested a short-term return that could coincide with the departure of co-star Rebecca Herbst (who plays Lucky&#x27;s love interest Elizabeth Webber) should she not renew her contract, allowing for periodic returns from the couple later on. Although Herbst expressed interest, the show opted to keep the characters on canvas.

The role was recast with Jacob Young, who had left his role as Rick Forrester on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;. Angela Shapiro, at the time President of ABC Daytime, stated: &quot;It is challenging to cast a character as intense and compelling as Lucky Spencer. We are fortunate to find a young actor with Jacob&#x27;s charisma and talent.&quot; Young assumed the role on February 25, 2000, almost a year after Jackson&#x27;s last appearance, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between characters due to Jackson&#x27;s popularity. Young commented: &quot;At first I was a little bit insecure about (taking the role after Jackson). But now that I&#x27;ve started to think about it, Lucky was such a great character, and Jonathan did such a great job that (fans) wanted him to come back. (Lucky) being in such demand, I think it was great that it opened up and allowed someone else to come in and give this character a shot.&quot; In November 2000, Young guest starred on the FOX network sketch comedy series &quot;MADtv&quot;, making a small cameo appearance as the character. That December, Young announced he would not be renewing his contract, and last appeared on February 10, 2003. He cited a desire to pursue music and film work at the time, later admitting monetary contract disagreements as the reason he left.

Greg Vaughan, who had recently been let go from his role as Diego Guittierez on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, was cast shortly thereafter and first appeared on February 20, 2003. Vaughan later described his screen test to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;: &quot;I was a little bit intimidated. I knew about the character, the foundation of the story. I knew it was a difficult task that I was about to take on.&quot; In July 2009, Vaughan denied rumors that he was being let go or put on recurring status. That September, ABC announced that Vaughan had decided to leave to explore other opportunities, and that Jackson would be reprising the role. However, Vaughan announced via Twitter that it was the network that decided to let him go. Jackson stated upon returning: &quot;It was a tough situation. I was not under any sort of headspace that someone was losing their job; it was that the role was opening up. (...) It was more of a confusing thing for me coming back and not knowing exactly what was going on, on the other end of things.&quot; Vaughan last aired on October 20, 2009, while Jackson first aired on October 27, 2009.

In November 2011, it was announced that Jackson would vacate the role due to the large amount of work he was receiving. &quot;TV Guide&quot; reported that Jackson attempted to negotiate with the network for a lighter schedule and to be repaired with on-screen love interest Herbst (Elizabeth), but was denied on both accounts. Jackson explained: &quot;I love to work hard but I&#x27;ve been at maximum capacity in terms of mental and emotional output for months on end and it has become too difficult. I am extremely thankful that they wanted to give me all those storylines with so much depth, but there&#x27;s just no balance. (...) I have a wife and three kids and other things in life I have to think about. I just knew I couldn&#x27;t sustain the schedule at &quot;GH&quot; and that kind of emotion for much longer. It was just too intense.&quot; Jackson confirmed the character would not die or be recast, and last appeared on December 23, 2011. In June 2015, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; revealed that Jackson would briefly reprise the role of Lucky, to be a part of the exit storyline of actor Anthony Geary.

On June 11, 2024, at the 51st Daytime Emmy Awards, executive producer Frank Valentini teased the return of a &quot;former cast member is coming back. And I think that the audience will go crazy for HIM&quot; to KABC-TV. Eighteen days later, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; announced Jackson would reprise the role of Lucky for a &quot;&quot;long&quot; run.&quot; Jackson returned to set on August 5, 2024, with Lucky returning during the August 23 episode as a series regular. In February 2025, Guy Wilson pinch-hit in the role while Jackson was unavailable.

Lucky Spencer first appears in October 1993, as a ten-year-old that has spent his life on the run from mobster Frank Smith (Mitchell Ryan) with his parents, Luke and Laura Spencer (Anthony Geary and Genie Francis). Smith finds them living in British Columbia, Canada, and Lucky is sent ahead to Port Charles for safety. Lucky is shot and almost paralyzed while following Luke. In August 1994, his sister Lesley Lu &quot;Lulu&quot; Spencer is born, and in 1995, he becomes good friends with Emily Quartermaine (then Amber Tamblyn) and they briefly run away. Lucky struggles with a gambling problem in early 1996 and accumulates a large debt playing poker. Lulu is diagnosed with aplastic anemia, and Lucky is shocked to learn about his half-brother Nikolas Cassadine (then Tyler Christopher), who arrives to donate bone marrow and becomes instant rivals with Lucky. Lucky helps Luke investigate Stefan Cassadine&#x27;s (Stephen Nichols) computer game &quot;Timoria&quot;, and they find his presumed dead grandmother Lesley Webber (Denise Alexander). On Valentine&#x27;s Day 1998, Lucky finds Elizabeth Webber (Rebecca Herbst) after she has been raped and takes care of her. He finds out from Nikolas that Luke raped Laura years ago, and moves out. He lives in a boxcar and eventually in a room above Jason Morgan (Steve Burton)&#x27;s bike shop in exchange for work. Lucky and Elizabeth help Nikolas and Emily catch Emily&#x27;s blackmailer, found to be Elizabeth&#x27;s rapist, and in the process Lucky and Nikolas start to bond. Meanwhile, Lucky and Elizabeth fall in love; they exchange vows in a church on Valentine&#x27;s Day in 1999. In April, Lucky is presumed dead in a fire, but it is revealed he is being held captive by Cesar Faison (Anders Hove), hired by Helena Cassadine (Constance Towers).

In early 2000, Helena lets Lucky (now Young) go and it becomes clear he has been brainwashed. Helena uses the Ice Princess diamond to make Lucky act violently and erases Lucky&#x27;s memories of love for Elizabeth. Elizabeth fakes her death to help Nikolas (then Stephen Martines, credited as Coltin Scott) gain Helena&#x27;s trust, and Lucky&#x27;s visions of her and their love help him break Helena&#x27;s control. They reunite, but he is unable to regain his feelings and in December 2001, Elizabeth stops their wedding when she realizes the truth. They struggle to start over, and Elizabeth breaks up with Lucky after she finds him kissing her sister Sarah Webber (then Sarah Laine). In August 2002, Lucky and Nikolas try to cover up the death of Laura&#x27;s stepfather Rick Webber (Chris Robinson) when they think Luke killed him. When Laura is told she killed Rick, she has a mental breakdown and has to be committed. Luke acts self-destructively and Nikolas takes control of Laura&#x27;s treatment, causing tension between Luke and Lucky (now Vaughan). When Lucky&#x27;s girlfriend Summer Halloway (Brittney Powell) is pushed off a cliff, he joins the police academy to help find evidence. Luke is unhappy that Lucky has become a cop, causing various rifts between them. In February 2004, Lucky almost dies during a fire at the Port Charles Hotel. When Nikolas (reprised by Christopher) is presumed dead in April, Lucky comforts Emily (now Natalia Livingston) and develops romantic feelings she does not return. Lucky is suspended for helping Nikolas when he presumably kills Helena. Lucky finds Helena, who shoots him, putting him into a coma. Luke unplugs his ventilator, causing him to breathe on his own. Meanwhile, Lucky and Elizabeth reconnect. Their financial struggles prompt Elizabeth to become a surrogate mother for Courtney (Alicia Leigh Willis) and Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), upsetting Lucky, but Elizabeth miscarries in September 2005. They marry in October, and Lucky takes on raising Liz&#x27;s son Cameron as his own. Lucky almost dies in a train crash on the way to their honeymoon, and again during an encephalitis outbreak in February 2006. In April, he has a serious back injury while trying to save Elizabeth from Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo). Overcome by his injury, financial trouble and guilt over the death of his partner Jesse Beaudry (Matt Marraccini), Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers and has an affair with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Elizabeth walks in on them, and sleeps with Jason Morgan, becoming pregnant. She lets Lucky believe he is the father to avoid him relapsing. Maxie fakes a pregnancy in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Lucky. Elizabeth divorces Lucky, but they remarry after he completes rehab. In May 2007, Elizabeth gives birth to Jacob Spencer. Her relationship with Jason makes Lucky jealous, and their marriage struggles. Lucky starts dating Jason&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) as they divorce. In November 2007, Lucky discovers the truth about Jake, but agrees to the secret to protect him from Jason&#x27;s dangerous lifestyle. Lucky and Sam break up.

In early 2009, Elizabeth is poisoned by a biotoxin and Lucky stays by her bedside. He is upset to learn in June that Ethan Lovett (Nathan Parsons) is his half brother. When Lucky dates Rebecca Shaw (Natalia Livingston), Nikolas kisses Elizabeth to make them jealous, prompting Lucky and Elizabeth to get back together. Elizabeth is attracted to Nikolas, and sleeps with him the night she accepts Lucky&#x27;s proposal. Meanwhile, Lucky (reprised by Jackson) works with Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) to investigate Franco (James Franco). In early 2010, Lucky finds Nikolas and Elizabeth having sex and eventually berates them. They learn she is pregnant, and Helena Cassadine changes the DNA test to show Nikolas as the father. In July, Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, who is kidnapped by Franco until Lucky finds him. Lucky is approached by Interpol to pose as Irish hitman Ronan O&#x27;Reilly and identify &quot;The Balkan&quot; (Daniel Benzali). Lucky brings Siobhan McKenna (Erin Chambers) home for safety, and asks her to marry him so she can get a green card. In March 2011, Elizabeth finds out Lucky is Aiden&#x27;s father, but keeps it a secret after Jake is killed in a hit-and-run accident. Lucky helps convince Elizabeth to donate Jake&#x27;s kidney to Josslyn Jacks. He finds out Luke hit Jake and accuses him of drunk driving, staging an unsuccessful intervention. Lucky burns down the old Spencer house, accidentally injuring Siobhan. To stop him from drinking, Elizabeth tells Lucky that Aiden is his son. Nikolas briefly plans to take Aiden out of the country before returning him and leaving town. Lucky volunteers for an undercover drug case during which Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) has him injected with drugs. Elizabeth finds Lucky but gets in a car accident that puts Siobhan in the hospital on her way to get him medication. Anthony kills Siobhan and Lucky uses pills when he finds her dead. He struggles to overcome his addiction. Elizabeth tries to reconcile but Lucky goes to Ireland. He receives a mysterious message that Aiden is hurt just in time to get him to the hospital. Elizabeth fakes a breakdown to get Lucky&#x27;s attention, and when Lucky finds out the truth he goes back to Ireland. He recognizes someone, later revealed to be his mother Laura. In 2013, Ethan reveals that Lucky is in Africa, doing volunteer work.

Lucky made a brief return in 2015 as part of Luke Spencer&#x27;s exit.

==Character development==

===Introduction===
Lucky is introduced to the canvas within the much anticipated return of his parents, famed &quot;General Hospital&quot; adventurers and popular supercouple of the 1970–80s, Luke and Laura Spencer. Luke and Laura had been last seen in Texas in December 1984, when Laura announces her pregnancy, and reveal off-screen in August 1985 that they had a son. The series SORAS-aged the child when he is introduced as a ten-year-old in 1993, played by Jackson. Anthony Geary (Luke) and writer Irene Suver helped to create the storyline of the family&#x27;s return, and the network fired most of the &quot;General Hospital&quot; writing team in August 1993 to bring on new head writer, Emmy Award winner Claire Labine. The original introduction story for Lucky was planned to have the child in need of a bone marrow transplant, a story later used on Lucky&#x27;s younger sister Lulu. Instead, the story included high-budget action sequences reminiscent of the couple&#x27;s previous adventures, including explosions, car chases and parachutes. Lucky had spent his life on the run with his parents, and is independent, street-smart and quick-witted. The character is shown to be a product of his parents, exhibiting qualities of both. Jackson later explained to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2009:
Lucky&#x27;s rich life experience for his young age makes him wise beyond his years. He plays cons with his parents and is always able to make a quick get away; in his introduction storyline, he travels from Canada to Port Charles on his own when his parents have to send him ahead for safety. He later is able to stay one step ahead of his parents when he and his friend Emily Quartermaine (then Tamblyn) briefly run away. He has a loving relationship with his unconventional parents, who often treat him as a friend and peer, especially his father. Luke in turn looks to see himself in Lucky, and the two have a very close bond. In 1995, Jackson described to the &quot;Los Angeles Times:&quot; &quot;Lucky lives every boy&#x27;s dream. He has loving parents, a baby sister, a loyal dog, and even a little bit of danger in his life. But with parents like Luke and Laura, he can&#x27;t help but get in on the action.&quot;

===Rebellion===
In 1998, the series chose to revisit the Luke and Laura rape storyline of the 1970s by having the incident revealed to Lucky. The controversial story of Luke raping Laura had quickly been renounced to a seduction at the time, after facing pressure from fans of the newly popular couple. In 1998, Pat Fili-Krushel, then President of Daytime Programming for ABC Daytime, explained to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;What we felt we should investigate is how, as the famous saying goes, the sins of the father are visited on the children.&quot; Head writer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. commented to the Associated Press: &quot;We are going to say, certainly, that the son is dealing with rape in a much better way, a much more appropriate way, and a much healthier way, than the father did.&quot;

In the story, Lucky comes across Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) after she has been raped, and confides his upset to his father before his hostile half-brother Nikolas Cassadine (then Christopher) reveals to him that Luke had raped Laura years prior. The betrayal Lucky feels from having the truth kept from him has a drastic impact on the character, especially because of how close he had been with his parents. Having moved around often, their relationship had become more like best friends than parent-child. Lucky struggles to understand his parents&#x27; actions. Jackson described Lucky in 1999 as: &quot;a black-and-white personality. He either loves or hates people. He doesn&#x27;t know about balance.&quot; Lucky&#x27;s relationship with each of his parents suffers; he thinks his mother is in denial about her attack, and is even more angry with his father for keeping the secret while Lucky was coping with Elizabeth&#x27;s assault. Lucky moves out and his independence grows further as he crashes at various places around Port Charles while holding odd jobs and continuing his schoolwork. As a result of the ordeal, honesty becomes important to Lucky; Jackson explained to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in December 1998: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t want to do what his parents did as far as keeping secrets from each other and lying. He&#x27;s pretty set on doing things differently when it comes to the decisions he makes in his life.&quot;

Lucky and Luke start a slow process of reconciling when Luke kidnaps Lucky to an abandoned cabin and Lucky watches Luke distressfully dream of the rape while suffering from a delirious fever following a wolf trap accident. Lucky&#x27;s relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas&#x27;s father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky&#x27;s estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told &quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot;: &quot;Lucky&#x27;s been trying to change the way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That&#x27;s part of the process – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He&#x27;s trying to find his own Spencer.&quot; The former enemies become friends, a sign of Lucky&#x27;s growth of character. Actress Genie Francis (Laura) explained to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in April 1999: &quot;It&#x27;s huge, absolutely huge. (It&#x27;s) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [Laura] with his big heart and his maturity.&quot; In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each. Guza explained: &quot;They still have a ways to go, but the important thing is they&#x27;re making the inroads now. (...) I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the final resolution between them, but they&#x27;re well on their way toward it.&quot;

===Relationship with Elizabeth Webber===
In 1998, Lucky enters into a relationship with Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) that affects his character throughout the years. Jackson explained to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; that prior to being paired with Elizabeth, the series had been hesitant to do a romantic storyline with his young character. He stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a real tricky thing, especially with me growing up on the show. I mean, I was 11 when I started, so there&#x27;s a lot of people watching who almost feel like parents. They&#x27;re sensitive about who I get interested in. I think it&#x27;s really cool to see everyone respond so positively toward [Herbst] and toward the characters being together.&quot; Lucky and Elizabeth first bond when Lucky finds Elizabeth after she has been raped. He protectively cares for her, and as their on-screen relationship gradually progresses to friendship and innocent romance, the characters&#x27; off-screen popularity made them known as a supercouple. Dealing with Elizabeth&#x27;s rape becomes more complicated for Lucky when he learns of the rape between his parents; he fears that he could have inherited violent sexual behaviors from his father, and could hurt Elizabeth. Elizabeth helps him deal with his fears, as well as his fallout with his parents.

Jackson explained that Lucky and Elizabeth&#x27;s mutual unfortunate life circumstances were a major factor in their growing relationship, stating: &quot;They automatically had a chance to prove to each other that they were going to be there through some of the worst stuff. And they passed.&quot; Jackson also felt that the couple&#x27;s relationship was crucial to Lucky&#x27;s growth and acceptance of his parents, stating to &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot; in 1999: &quot;I think it was through that relationship and that love that Lucky obtained a sense of peace that made him want to mend things with his parents more. I don&#x27;t think he would have done it otherwise.&quot; When Jackson left the series in April 1999, Lucky and Elizabeth&#x27;s teenage romance ends as Lucky is presumed dead in a fire. The couple attempts reconciliation from 2000 to 2002 during Jacob Young&#x27;s tenure, and reunites in 2005 while Greg Vaughan played the role. Lucky and Elizabeth have an on-and-off relationship throughout the years that includes marriages, infidelity and children. Herbst explained portraying the relationship through different actors to &quot;Comcast&quot; in 2010: &quot;The characters are still the same. Each individual actor chose to play him a little differently. You just roll with it. Each relationship was different. They all had their uniqueness.&quot;

===Edge===
After Jackson left the series in April 1999, the character was kept off-screen for almost a year before Young took over the role upon Lucky’s return in February 2000. Young commented on his new character: &quot;I like Lucky&#x27;s mystique. He&#x27;s just very cool, relaxed. He never oversteps his boundaries. I’m planning to give my own perspective to this.&quot; The series explained the character&#x27;s absence and staged death as a kidnapping by Cesar Faison (Hove) and Helena Cassadine (Towers). It is soon apparent upon his return that Lucky has been brainwashed; Guza explained the change in character that would be seen in Lucky&#x27;s reunion with his parents: &quot;The kid doesn&#x27;t at all react the way we expected. This time he&#x27;s been away he&#x27;s obviously changed a great deal, into a different person emotionally. His whole relationship to his parents is confusing. It&#x27;s a different Lucky, in many ways.&quot; The mind control continues after Lucky is released; Helena makes him act erratically and violently, hurting his father and forgetting his memories of love for Elizabeth. The ordeal leaves an impression on Lucky after it is over; the writers used the opportunity to develop an edge to the character. The series promoted Lucky as a &quot;rebel&quot; in its teen-focused summer advertising campaign in 2000. Young filmed commercials where he stated in character: &quot;Rules? I don&#x27;t play that game.&quot; Young explained the change in character to entertainment journalist Candace Havens in 2000:

Lucky maintains his edgier nature as his relationship with Elizabeth falls apart as a result of Helena&#x27;s damage, and later on as he deals with his mother&#x27;s mental breakdown and catatonia. &quot;TVSource Magazine&quot; reflected in 2009 on Lucky&#x27;s character during Young&#x27;s tenure: &quot;The brainwashing eventually wore off, but the character never really gelled with the brave, strong, compassionate and loyal son of Luke Spencer that Jackson had created.&quot;

===Adulthood===
Vaughan assumed the role in 2003. He was a visually older actor than Young and Jackson, and Lucky&#x27;s storylines grew to become more adult as well. In 2009, Vaughan reflected that fans “embraced me more as Lucky being the man, instead of the child.” The year Vaughan started, Lucky starts a career in law enforcement when he joins the police academy in order to become involved in the murder investigation of his girlfriend Summer Halloway (Powell). This was a confusing character change for viewers, as Lucky had grown up emulating his parents and their cons, sharing in his father&#x27;s distaste for law enforcement. Becoming a cop puts Lucky and his father Luke on opposite sides of the law, a contributing factor to the tension seen between them in forthcoming years. Other adult issues Lucky faces include financial struggles and marriage. In 2005, Lucky is repaired with Elizabeth and becomes the stepfather to her son Cameron. Vaughan told &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in 2005:
During Vaughan&#x27;s tenure, Lucky also made a drastic character change away from his previously known quick thinking and street smarts, seen both in his police work and personal life. By 2009, Abby West of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Lucky was &quot;a character who&#x27;s been written as earnest (he&#x27;s Johnny Law to his father&#x27;s rebel) if not the brightest bulb&quot;, while Leslie Gray Streeter of &quot;The Palm Beach Post&quot; called him &quot;everybody&#x27;s favorite cute punching bag.&quot; The character&#x27;s misfortune escalates in 2006, when Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers following the stress of a back injury, his medical bills and his guilt over the death of his partner. Adding to his stress, his pride is often hurt when Elizabeth is saved from peril by Jason Morgan (Burton) rather than him, adding stress to their marriage. His addiction leads to an affair with Maxie Jones (Storms), who supplies him pills and fakes a pregnancy in an attempt to make him stay with her. Elizabeth finds out about the affair and sleeps with Jason, becoming pregnant and telling Lucky he is the father. The series of unfortunate storylines led Steeler to state that the writers &quot;made [Lucky] a dull stooge whose woman would rather be with anyone else but him&quot;, while &quot;TVSource Magazine&quot; called Lucky &quot;Port Charles&#x27; bumbling police detective who just can&#x27;t catch a break&quot;.

Lucky&#x27;s relationship with Elizabeth falls apart due to their financial problems, Lucky’s addiction, their infidelity, and Lucky&#x27;s discovery in 2007 that Elizabeth&#x27;s son Jake is Jason&#x27;s son. Meanwhile, Lucky&#x27;s misfortune continues as his best friend Emily Quartermaine (then Livingston) is murdered the same night his father has a heart attack. Vaughan described Lucky&#x27;s state of mind to the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; in 2007: “Words cannot define the rage and the fury. This beautiful thing, that has completely altered his life and given it new meaning, is a lie. (...) He&#x27;s bitter. He&#x27;s also in a very weak place, emotionally and physically.” Accompanying the fallout of Lucky and Elizabeth&#x27;s marriage, Jason&#x27;s jealous ex-girlfriend Sam McCall (Monaco) manipulates Lucky into a relationship with her as revenge on Elizabeth, although her feelings eventually turn genuine. Monaco described the pairing to &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; in 2008: &quot;Sam and Lucky&#x27;s romance was nice. It was sweet. It was friendly. It was innocent. I mean, gosh, Sam did do a lot of manipulating and crap (to land Lucky), but he was teaching her a lot.&quot;

During Vaughan&#x27;s tenure, Lucky becomes more of a backburner character with minimal story arcs that center around him. During budget cuts in 2009, Vaughan addressed rumors by stating, “I haven&#x27;t been put on recurring status – but it feels like it!”

===Jackson&#x27;s return===
Jackson returned to the role in October 2009, and viewers wondered if Lucky would regain original character traits that had changed over the years and different actors. Jackson stated that he had not seen the other actors&#x27; portrayal of Lucky and was basing his reprisal on his experience of creating the role. He told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;:

Jackson said that he was not concerned or focused on the events in Lucky&#x27;s life while he was gone, stating: “You can&#x27;t act information and you can&#x27;t act history (...) That&#x27;s what happened and that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s gone through, and that&#x27;s that.” Jackson felt the heart and soul of the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.

When asked about the now strained relationship between Lucky and Luke, Jackson stated: “Tony [Geary] and I have had some great scenes that feel like re-establishing something. Again, I did not watch the other versions of Lucky, but for me it&#x27;s picking up where I left off ten years ago, but now as an adult. There is a lot of interesting chemistry going on there.” The history between Jackson and Geary helped the on-screen relationship become more dynamic. Jackson&#x27;s return also saw the relationship between Lucky and Jason change. Although Lucky does not abandon the police force, the previously black-and-white cop works hand-in-hand with the mob enforcer in attempts to take down both &quot;The Balkan&quot; (Benzali) and Franco (James Franco). Lucky becomes stuck between the two sides of the law. Jackson explained to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; in 2009: &quot;I think my instincts towards him being a detective (include) ambiguity. Growing up as Luke&#x27;s son, and given Luke&#x27;s ties to the mob, Lucky&#x27;s seen the world from both sides. I don&#x27;t think that Lucky sees it as black and white. There are shades of gray.&quot; In 2010, when asked if Lucky would become more “Luke-like” now that he was back in the role, Jackson replied: “I am hoping that is where they go with it. Lucky has been doing a lot of that straight cop stuff. I think if we can show the wild side of him that resembles Luke that will be nice.” He commented in a 2011 interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that he would like Lucky and Luke to work a con again, stating: &quot;Lucky feels the most free and like himself when he&#x27;s doing stuff like that. They&#x27;ve had Luke and Lucky pitted against each other for a while, so it&#x27;d be nice to pair them up.&quot;

===Tragedy===
When Jackson returned to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is having an affair with his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky&#x27;s remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to &quot;Comcast&quot;: &quot;I truly believe that [Elizabeth] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It&#x27;s hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she&#x27;s very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That&#x27;s kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life.&quot; When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website &quot;Zap2it&quot; described that Lucky: &quot;generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson&#x27;s trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin&#x27; hearts off-kilter.&quot; Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: &quot;Jonathan actually seemed like one more step and he was going to take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at me like he did.&quot; Jones from &quot;Zap2it&quot; stated that in the confrontation scenes: &quot;Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young&#x27;s and most recently, Greg Vaughan&#x27;s. Now Lucky seems like a whole person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties.&quot; Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky&#x27;s position:
In a separate interview, Jackson stated that while on the surface Lucky may not want the child to be his, deep down he thinks a part of the character does. Elizabeth hopes Lucky is the father, thinking it is the only way she can salvage their relationship, and has a difficult time coming to terms with Lucky not wanting her anymore. After Lucky finds her suffering from hypothermia in the church where they said their vows as teenagers, and later has to talk her down off the roof of the hospital, she is sent to Shadybrook sanitarium. This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: &quot;The crisis that&#x27;s going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don&#x27;t have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky up to say, &#x27;I need to get my stuff together because I need to be present for those kids.&#x27;&quot; Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, and they believe Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test. Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship. Still feeling lost, Lucky accepts an undercover assignment to pose as an Irish hitman named Ronan O&#x27;Reilly, coincidentally his doppelgänger. Lucky works to take down &quot;The Balkan&quot;, and meets Siobhan McKenna (Chambers), who initially puts an end to his romantic bad luck streak. They face trouble when Siobhan is blackmailed by The Balkan and hides it from Lucky, who is sensitive to betrayal after Elizabeth&#x27;s affair. They eventually plan a green card marriage so that she can stay in the country with him. During their first ceremony, Lucky learns his son Jake has been in a hit-and-run accident, that eventually renders him braindead. Jake&#x27;s death sets another string of tragic events in motion. Lucky finds out his father was the driver, and accuses Luke of driving drunk. Lucky is adamant that his father is an alcoholic, but Luke refutes that Lucky wants to blame the alcohol so that he does not have to blame him. Lucky eventually stages an intervention, which only angers Luke. Lucky tracks Luke down to the brothel where Luke grew up, but when Luke tells Lucky that it liberated him to kill Jake, Lucky leaves. Distraught, he burns down his childhood home, accidentally injuring Siobhan. Elizabeth finds Lucky and tells him that he is Aiden&#x27;s father, stopping Lucky from drinking. In May 2011, Jackson spoke of the unending turmoil in Lucky&#x27;s life:

Lucky&#x27;s life did not subside; he volunteers for an undercover drug case, and is injected with drugs under the orders of Anthony Zacchara (Weitz). He spends a night hallucinating, and although Elizabeth finds him and eventually gets him medication, she meanwhile gets in a car accident that puts Lucky&#x27;s wife Siobhan in the hospital. Anthony murders Siobhan, and her death is the last straw for Lucky, who willingly takes pills. Lucky struggles but stops his drug use. He denies Elizabeth&#x27;s attempts to reconcile and leaves town in December 2011.

Jackson stated leaving his children during Christmas was one piece of unfinished business Lucky had, as well as not having gone on any adventures with his family. Anthony Geary agreed, telling &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot;: &quot;That was a major production mistake, and a terrible waste. The whole family was primed for a great adventure together. The audience would have loved it, and it would have been completely consistent with our family history. Sometimes they miss the most obvious story ideas. It&#x27;s frustrating.&quot; Geary added that father and son were left in a bitter place when Lucky abruptly left town, lacking any resolution after Jake&#x27;s death and the intervention. When asked in 2012 to describe Lucky after his departure, Jackson explained to &quot;CT Post&quot;: &quot;He has a dark side, but he&#x27;s a really good soul. He&#x27;s more tortured than villainous. He&#x27;s had drug abuse, lost a child, been through a lot.&quot;

==Reception==
In 2023, Charlie Mason from &quot;Soaps She Knows&quot; placed Lucky at #16 on his ranked list of &quot;General Hospital’s 40+ Greatest Characters of All Time&quot;, commenting that &quot;A do-right guy in a do-wrong town, Luke’s halo-clad son was destined to suffer — and man, did he, through his own “death,” drug addiction, adultery and, in the end, the demolition of his relationship with true love Elizabeth Webber… at least for now.&quot;

===Introduction===
The introduction of Lucky, paired with Luke and Laura&#x27;s reintroduction, was met with some cynicism; Georgia Dullea of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; did not approve of the show&#x27;s decision to let go of other popular characters in order to introduce the family. Dullea also accused the series of using Lucky, an attractive child character, as an effort to get fans to care for Luke and Laura as much as they did during the height of the couple&#x27;s popularity. However, ratings rose after the family appeared, and fans responded positively. Jackson&#x27;s portrayal of Lucky was also welcomed and received praise from critics. Allison Waldman of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; reflected in 2008: &quot;Jonathan came onto the show with huge expectations thrust upon him. He was Luke and Laura&#x27;s son, Lucas Lorenzo Spencer, Jr. – Lucky. He had to be up to speed in scenes with Genie Francis and Anthony Geary. (...) Jonathan was perfect right out of the gate; he looked, sounded and acted like he&#x27;d be Luke&#x27;s kid. He was sensitive like Laura, too, not just a smart ass kid.&quot; In 1995, Jackson won his first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series and his first Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Child Actor. He was nominated for Young Artist Awards in 1996, 1997 and 1999. He won &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;&#x27;s YoungStar Award in 1995, 1997, 1998 and 1999, and was nominated in 2000. He again won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Younger Actor in 1998 and 1999, making him the record holder for the Younger Actor category, both with three wins and with six nominations. Jackson won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Younger Lead Actor in 1999. During his teenage years as Lucky, Jackson became a popular &quot;teen heartthrob&quot; among fans, featured on fan magazines such as &quot;Tiger Beat&quot; and garnering many fan clubs and internet fansites.

===Romance===

During Jackson&#x27;s first stint as Lucky, the character&#x27;s relationship with Elizabeth Webber (Herbst) was called a supercouple, compared to Lucky&#x27;s parents Luke and Laura. The characters first became popular during the storyline of Elizabeth&#x27;s rape in 1998, a storyline that received critical acclaim. Viewers wrote to the series praising the story and how it helped rape victims to heal. The storyline won &quot;General Hospital&quot; a SHINE Award (Sexual Health IN Entertainment) in 1998. Fans also responded to Jackson&#x27;s performance; Robyn Flans of &quot;Soap Opera Magazine&quot; stated in 1998: &quot;Jonathan&#x27;s sensitive portrayal of a young man experiencing the awakening of his own male stirrings while horrified by this hideous act of violence has been magnificent, and you have an amazing character – one that Jackson manipulates to perfection.&quot; Lucky and Elizabeth&#x27;s romantic relationship took place gradually as result of the rape, and viewers liked the slow pacing that made the relationship honest and innocent, something unique among soap opera couples at the time. Each character dealing with personal issues, the couple&#x27;s first kiss happened months into the relationship, and was anticipated and celebrated by fans. The series used the popular teen characters as an opportunity to reach young viewers with a social message through Lucky and Elizabeth&#x27;s decision to abstain from sex. Executive producer at the time Wendy Riche explained her desire to show the decisions and pressures teenagers face, stating to &quot;Soap Opera Weekly&quot;: &quot;We have the opportunity with these beloved characters who have struggled together and who have loved together and who are exploring sexuality together to reach an audience that doesn&#x27;t really want to be preached to, but wants to feel it.&quot; Herbst and Jackson&#x27;s popularity continued after Jackson&#x27;s April 1999 departure; that July they were voted number one actor, actress and couple by fans of &quot;Soaps In Depth&quot;.

===Recasts===
When Jackson left the role in 1999, a recast was opposed by viewers and costars. When Jackson&#x27;s departure had previously been rumored in 1996, Anthony Geary (Luke) told &quot;TV Guide&quot; that he &quot;went to (the &quot;GH&quot; powers) and said, &#x27;If we lose him, then let&#x27;s kill Lucky.&#x27; Jonathan is too much a part of us to replace him.&quot; Geary repeated these sentiments when Jackson confirmed leaving in 1999. When a recast was rumored in early 2000, Jackson stated: &quot;When all the actors who are going to be working with the character don&#x27;t want it, it&#x27;s kind of too bad that they still do it. But I don&#x27;t really get surprised with a lot of things that they do.&quot; The role was recast with Jacob Young, and by the time he appeared on-screen in February 2000, the character had been off-screen for almost a year, speculated to be an attempt to ease the transition between actors due to Jackson&#x27;s popularity. Young was able to become accepted by fans; in 2001, Candace Havens wrote in &quot;The Free Lance–Star&quot;: &quot;His hard work has paid off and many fans can&#x27;t even remember there was ever someone else in the role.&quot; Young was named Sexiest Soap Star by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 2001. In 2002, Young won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor. Greg Vaughan, who took over the role from 2003 to 2009, was the only portrayer of Lucky not to be nominated for an Emmy award. However, Vaughan did have a fan following. He was chosen by ABC Daytime and SOAPnet to participate in their 2008 Hot Guys Calendar, featuring popular male costars from ABC soap operas. At the start of 2008, &quot;Zap2it&quot; named Vaughan No. 6 on their Top 10 Most Improved list, stating: &quot;The gorgeous Mr. Vaughan plays angry and sexy very well. Thank goodness we&#x27;re getting to see it.&quot; During Vaughan&#x27;s tenure, Lucky entered into a relationship with Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) that was popular with fans. &quot;Zap2it&quot; named them No. 6 on their list of Top Couples of 2007, and tied them for No. 3 in 2008 along with entangled couple Elizabeth (Herbst) and Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), stating: &quot;[Lucky and Sam were] conceived out of a revenge plot, yet quickly surprised fans and execs alike with their instant chemistry. Is the Quad in for another partner-switching shake-up in 2009?&quot; When Vaughan left in 2009, he reflected on his reception: &quot;I am grateful as to how the fans embraced me, whether they liked me or not. It was my job to win them over and I did that in due time.&quot; Some felt Vaughan was not a good fit for the character. In April 2008, Allison Waldman of &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; named Jackson as one of the top ten actors to make an impact on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, stating: &quot;He&#x27;s still the real Lucky to many people, even though two other actors have subsequently played the part.&quot;

===Jackson&#x27;s reprisal===
When Jackson was hired to reprise the role in 2009, his return was highly anticipated, but accompanied by controversy as Vaughan was let go in order to bring Jackson back. Fans had a bittersweet reaction to the switch. The network promoted Jackson&#x27;s return with the phrase, &quot;Elizabeth&#x27;s first love is back!&quot;, which angered some of Vaughan&#x27;s fans. However, ratings rose the week Jackson returned, and his performance was well received. Jackson was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2010, only having been with the show for three months of 2009. Jackson&#x27;s return changed the dynamic of the Elizabeth and Nikolas affair storyline, which had a negative reception from fans who thought it did not align with the history between Herbst and Jackson. The scenes in early 2010 where Lucky confronts Elizabeth and Nikolas about their affair received praise. That April, &quot;We Love Soaps&quot; named Jackson No. 26 of the top 50 Greatest Soap Actors, Damon L. Jacobs commenting: &quot;From that first scene as Lucky in the Canadian diner, to his recent scenes of betrayal railing against Elizabeth and Nikolas, Jonathan adds a profound depth and spiritual gravity to the scripted words that is far beyond his years. His piercing bloodshot eyes shoot daggers far more deadly than Sonny&#x27;s guns, and his smile encapsulates all that was celebrated about Luke and Laura&#x27;s connection.&quot; Michael Logan of &quot;TV Guide&quot; named Jackson the best actor of 2010, referencing the affair confrontation when stating:
Jackson submitted those scenes for the 38th Daytime Emmy Awards, where he won his fourth Daytime Emmy Award and first win as Outstanding Supporting Actor. The scenes were compared to classics such as Judith Light&#x27;s performance of Karen Wolek&#x27;s courtroom confession scene on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and Kim Zimmer’s performance of Reva Shayne&#x27;s fountain scene on &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s on-screen chemistry with Erin Chambers (Siobhan) also had a positive reception at the end of 2010. However the following year they were rated the No. 6 Worst Soap Opera Couple of 2011 by &quot;Zap2it&quot;, who stated: &quot;We spent 2011 desperately clinging to those few early memories, as Siobhan transformed from an appealing character into a shrill, insecure harpy (...) Try as Jackson and Chambers might, the actors were unable to salvage an ounce of their prior appeal as a couple.&quot; On the other hand, the entertainment website named Jackson No. 3 of the Top 10 Male Entertainers that year. Jackson had a range of emotional work in 2011 that received acclaim, including the scenes following the death of Lucky&#x27;s son Jake, a storyline met by criticism by some fans. In 2012, Jackson won his fifth Daytime Emmy Award for his scenes where Lucky tells Luke that Luke was the driver that hit Jake and confronts him about his drinking. When Jackson was nominated, &quot;On-Air On-Soaps&quot; stated:
In 2024, Michael Fairman named Jackson&#x27;s return as his &quot;Worst Return&quot; for his &quot;Best and Worst in Soaps 2024&quot; listing. In his write-up, Fairman called out the writer&#x27;s material, believing they &quot;could not have set up his return worse&quot;. He also noted how the character spent weeks &quot;lamenting whether he should just go back to Africa, and it all came off as wishy-washy, deadbeat dad syndrome.&quot; In conclusion, Fairman noted his hope for a &quot;major story&quot; for Jackson in the role.

<doc id="674950" wikidata="Q2255221" url="?curid=674950" title="Elocution">
<text>Elocution is the study of formal speaking in pronunciation, grammar, style, and tone as well as the idea and practice of effective speech and its forms. It stems from the idea that while communication is symbolic, sounds are final and compelling. 

Elocution emerged in England in the 18th and 19th centuries and in the United States during the 19th century. It benefited men and women in different ways; the overall concept was to teach both how to become better, more persuasive speakers, standardize errors in spoken and written English, and the beginnings of the formulation of argument were discussed.

==History==
In Western classical rhetoric, elocution was one of the five core disciplines of pronunciation, which was the art of delivering speeches. Orators were trained not only on proper diction, but on the proper use of gestures, stance, and dress. There was a movement in the eighteenth century to standardize English writing and speaking and elocution was a part of this movement, with the help of Sheridan and Walker. (Another area of rhetoric, elocutio, was unrelated to &quot;elocution&quot; and, instead, concerned the style of writing proper to discourse.)

Elocution emerged as a formal discipline during the eighteenth century. One of its important figures was Thomas Sheridan, actor and father of Richard Brinsley Sheridan. Thomas Sheridan&#x27;s lectures on elocution, collected in &quot;Lectures on Elocution&quot; (1762) and his &quot;Lectures on Reading&quot; (1775), provided directions for marking and reading aloud passages from literature. Another actor, John Walker, published his two-volume &quot;Elements of Elocution&quot; in 1781, which provided detailed instruction on voice control, gestures, pronunciation, and emphasis. Sheridan had a lot of ground to cover with having to be one of the first to establish great ideas about this subject, speaking more vaguely on subjects, but promising to explain them further. While Walker&#x27;s approach was an attempt to put in place rules and a system on the correct form of elocution. 

One reason these books gained traction was that both authors took a scientific approach and made rhetorically-built arguments in a time period where manual-styled, scientific, how-to books were popular. Including these were &quot;over four hundred editions&quot; of grammar and &quot;two hundred fifteen editions&quot; of dictionary books that became available to the public in the 1700s, &quot;five times more ... after 1750&quot; than prior. This was because education held a heavier weight in social status so therefore upper-class, higher educated people were reading these books as well as whoever else wanted to have the appearance of more gentleman or lady-like class than they may have been from.

With the publication of these works and similar ones, elocution gained wider public interest. While training on proper speaking had been an important part of private education for many centuries, the rise in the nineteenth century of a middle class in Western countries (and the corresponding rise of public education) led to great interest in the teaching of elocution, and it became a staple of the school curriculum. American students of elocution drew selections from what were popularly deemed &quot;Speakers.&quot; By the end of the century, several Speaker texts circulated throughout the United States, including McGuffey&#x27;s &quot;New Juvenile Speaker&quot;, the &quot;Manual of Elocution and Reading&quot;, the &quot;Star Speaker&quot;, and the popular &quot;Delsarte Speaker&quot;. Some of these texts even included pictorial depictions of body movements and gestures to augment written descriptions.

The era of the elocution movement, defined by the likes of Sheridan and Walker, evolved in the early and mid-1800s into what is called the scientific movement of elocution, defined in the early period by James Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Philosophy of the Human Voice&quot; (1827) and Richard Whately&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Rhetoric&quot; (1828), and in the later period by Alexander Melville Bell&#x27;s &quot;A New Elucidation of Principles of Elocution&quot; (1849) and &quot;Visible Speech&quot; (1867).

The once-popular female-dominated genre of elocution set to musical accompaniment in the United States is the subject of a 2017 book by Marian Wilson Kimber.

In a 2020 article, &quot;&#x27;The Artful Woman&#x27;: Mrs. Ellis and the Domestication of Elocution&quot;, Don Paul Abbott writes about Sarah Stickney Ellis and her work &quot;Young Ladies Reader&quot; (1845) and its impact on women&#x27;s lives in the nineteenth century. Ellis&#x27; work, as well as others that were published around the same time, had compilations of other authors&#x27; works. Ellis had intended her work to be for other women, therefore she compiled a number of women&#x27;s writings in her work, as did other authors more or less dependent on specific ones. This was still during a time when it was well believed that women and men lived in &quot;separate spheres&quot;. 

Ellis did not go the lengths that Sheridan and Walker did when it came to developing theories and rules for elocution but she made it clear through her writing that she believed that the spoken word was powerful and mastering it &quot;deserves the attention&quot; of ladies all around. She comes to this idea of &quot;The Artful Woman&quot;, a concept of a lady who is able to persuade others, specifically mentioning her husband. According to Abbott, Ellis believes that she had empowered women in their own sphere, so much so he argues in his journal article that it is possible she delayed women stepping &quot;from the parlor to the podium&quot;.

== Modern elocution ==
Jason Munsell, a communications and speech professor, theorizes that part of elocution is strategic movement and visuals. This is suggested due to a major portion of communication occurring digitally. In his journal article from 2011, he wrote that the writings of elocution during the mid-nineteenth century aided women in becoming rhetorically empowered. Munsell, when examining a bulletin from the time period, makes an argument that elocution may have been the beginning of the rhetoric concept of Literary theory, &quot;The bulletin also explained that the function of elocution was to discover possible meanings of a reading, to learn how to express those meanings, then to discover the intended purpose.&quot;

<doc id="674952" wikidata="Q1600361" url="?curid=674952" title="Area codes 519, 226, 548, and 382">
<text>Area codes 519, 226, 548, and 382 are overlay telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for most of southwestern Ontario.

Area code 519 was the initial code of the numbering plan area (NPA). It was created in 1953 from the western portion of area code 416 and the southwestern portion of 613. The numbering plan area is mostly bounded by area code 905, except for Simcoe County which is bordered by 705. Area code 226 was added to the numbering plan area in 2006, and 548 was added in 2015. In 2023, the overlay was expanded again with the addition of area code 382.

The primary incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) in the overlay complex is Bell Canada, with numerous other small independent companies that covered vast tracts of rural Ontario. Since competition for service was mandated in 1997, numerous competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) have also started serving the region.

==History==
Area code 519 was created in 1953 by a split of two numbering plan areas (NPAs), from the western portion of 416 and the southwestern portion of 613. In 1957, parts of 519 and 613 formed area code 705.
An exhaustion study for area code 519 in the 1990s resulted in a recommendation to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to add a second area code, 226, to the numbering plan area. In 1992, an overlay relief plan was approved (&quot;Telecom Decision CRTC 2002-25&quot;). Although it primarily accepted the industry proposal, the CRTC required a permissive dialling period of four months, with consistent network announcements to consumers, instead of the proposed two-month period. On April 15, 2003, the committee recommended delaying the introduction of the 226 area code from February 19, 2005, to October 21, 2006, primarily as a result of updated forecasts of the exhaustion projections.

In a second overlay expansion, area code 548 was added to the overlay, effective June 4, 2015.

Canadian Numbering Administrator (CNA) advised the CRTC on October 12, 2011, that based on the rate of expansion the numbering system would again be exhausted by January 2017. The CRTC in response developed a relief plan (&quot;Telecom Decision CRTC 2012-655&quot;) which set the framework for addressing the exhaustion and oversee the addition of an additional overlay number. Area code 382 was reserved as a fourth code for the region with an in-service date of June 17, 2023.

The numbering plan area covers a wide area (over 36,000 km2), and no single municipality controlling a majority of the available numbers.

While the implementation of 548 had the effect of allocating a total of over 23 million numbers to a region of 2.6 million people, overlays have become the preferred method of relief in Canada and the United States. Canada does not use telephone number pooling as a relief measure. Each CLEC is allocated blocks of 10,000 numbers (corresponding to a single three-digit prefix) for every rate centre where it offers service, even in the smallest hamlets. While most rate centres do not need nearly that many numbers, once a central office code is allocated to a carrier and rate centre, it cannot be relocated.

<text>FanDuel Sports Network Sun is an American regional sports network owned by Main Street Sports Group (formerly Diamond Sports Group) and operated as an affiliate of FanDuel Sports Network. The channel broadcasts local coverage of professional, collegiate and sporting events in the state of Florida, with a focus on professional sports teams based in Miami, Tampa and Orlando. FanDuel Sports Network Sun and sister regional sports network FanDuel Sports Network Florida are headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with studios located in Tampa.

FanDuel Sports Network is available on cable providers throughout Florida; it is also available nationwide on satellite via DirecTV.

==History==

The channel launched on March 4, 1988, as Sunshine Network, originally serving as an affiliate of Prime Network. The network was formed as a joint-venture of 11 cable companies and Home Sports Entertainment. Later that year, Sunshine would obtain rights to broadcast the Orlando Magic in their inaugural season. In 1992, the network would also secure rights to another new team, the Tampa Bay Lightning. In its early years, the network also aired some public affairs programming in addition to sports.

Because Florida did not have a Major League Baseball team at the time, the network featured games from multiple teams including Rangers, Astros, Tigers, Orioles, and Twins, along with college sports from UCF, Florida State, Stetson and Jacksonville Universities. In 1993, Sunshine gained rights to the Florida Marlins expansion team. In 1997, half of the 70 game schedule was moved to rival SportsChannel Florida (which at the time was owned by Marlins&#x27; owner Wayne Huizenga). The following season, the entire schedule was moved to SportsChannel.

In 1996, News Corporation, which formed a sports division for the Fox Broadcasting Company in 1994 with the acquisition of the television rights to the National Football Conference of the National Football League, entered into a joint venture with TCI spinoff Liberty Media and rebranded that company&#x27;s Prime Network affiliates under the &quot;Fox Sports Net&quot; banner. Sunshine Network was the only Fox Sports Net owned-and-operated charter outlet that did not rebrand under that name when it and the other Prime outlets relaunched as Fox Sports Net on November 1, 1996. Liberty Media (which at this point owned 49% of the network) proposed Fox Sports Sunshine as a new name for the network, but ultimately the rest of the owners did not approve it. In early 2000, Fox Sports Net programming moved from Sunshine to the newly rebranded Fox Sports Net Florida.


Sunshine Network changed its name to Sun Sports on January 18, 2005, in order to reflect its sports-focused programming. Sun Sports and Fox Sports Florida were spun off with the rest of the Fox Sports Networks and most of News Corporation&#x27;s other U.S. entertainment properties into 21st Century Fox in July 2013. On October 4, 2015, Sun Sports changed its name to Fox Sports Sun (FSSUN).

On December 14, 2017, as part of a merger between both companies, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports Networks from 21st Century Fox, including Fox Sports Sun and sister network Fox Sports Florida. However, on June 27, 2018, the Justice Department ordered their divestment under antitrust grounds, citing Disney&#x27;s ownership of ESPN. On May 3, 2019, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios (through their joint venture, Diamond Holdings) bought Fox Sports Networks from The Walt Disney Company for $10.6 billion. The deal closed on August 22, 2019. On November 17, 2020, Sinclair announced an agreement with casino operator Bally&#x27;s Corporation to serve as a new naming rights partner for the FSN channels. Sinclair announced the new Bally Sports branding for the channels on January 27, 2021. On March 31, 2021, coinciding with the 2021 Major League Baseball season, Fox Sports Sun and sister network Fox Sports Florida were rebranded as Bally Sports Sun and Bally Sports Florida, resulting in 18 other Regional Sports Networks renamed Bally Sports in their respective regions. The first live sports event on Bally Sports Sun was at 7 PM featuring the Miami Heat at the Indiana Pacers. The game was preceded with the &quot;Heat Live&quot; pregame show.

On March 14, 2023, Diamond Sports filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.]

On May 1st, 2024, Comcast halted Bally Sports Sun programming.

On October 16, 2024, it was revealed in a court filing that Diamond had reached a new sponsorship agreement with FanDuel Group, under which it intends to rebrand Bally Sports as the FanDuel Sports Network; on October 18, 2024, Diamond officially announced the rebranding, which will take effect October 21. Under the agreement, FanDuel will have the option to take a minority equity stake of up to 5% once Diamond Sports exits bankruptcy. The branding will be downplayed within programming related to high school sports.

==Programming==
FanDuel Sports Network Sun holds the regional cable television rights to the NBA&#x27;s Miami Heat, the NHL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Lightning, and the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball. In addition, FanDuel Sports Network Sun offers insider programming for the Florida Gators and Florida State Seminoles.

FanDuel Sports Network Sun maintains separate feeds for individual regions of the state, with feeds for Miami (covering South Florida), Tampa (covering western Florida) and Orlando (covering northern and central Florida). The separation of broadcast zones for the channel is mostly due to the defined broadcast territories set by the National Basketball Association for the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat, and by the National Hockey League for the Tampa Bay Lightning. Programming seen in each broadcasting zone is common in most areas, and includes a mix of programs supplied by Bally Sports and some original programming exclusive to FanDuel Sports Network Sun and FanDuel Sports Network Florida. Due to the naming rights deal with FanDuel, select programming from FanDuel TV is included in the schedule.

FanDuel Sports Network Sun is also home to outdoor programming, highlighted by extensive salt and fresh water fishing programs such as the Chevy Florida Insider Fishing Report and Sportsman&#x27;s Adventures.

===Former Programming===
From 2003 to 2004, the network aired Major League Wrestling&#x27;s (MLW) taped weekly professional wrestling show MLW Underground TV which featured taped matches from MLW&#x27;s past events.

=== Programming rights with FanDuel Sports Network Florida ===
FanDuel Sports Network Sun shares the broadcast rights to the aforementioned professional sports teams with FanDuel Sports Network Florida. As the two regional networks are commonly owned, events from any team/conference in which FDSN Sun and FDSN Florida broadcasts are able to air on either channel depending on the start time of each team&#x27;s respective games (particularly with the Marlins and Rays, since both teams routinely play at concurring start times).

The two channels do not focus on one region of Florida (although it was long rumored since the two came under common ownership that FDSN Sun would carry only teams from the Orlando and Tampa Bay areas, while FDSN Florida would carry Miami-area teams), but simply distribute games in accordance with each team&#x27;s territorial rights, with both cable channels maintaining joint exclusivity over regional broadcasts of Lightning, Heat, Marlins, Rays and the Magic, while Bally Sports Florida maintains exclusive regional rights to NHL games involving the Miami-based Florida Panthers.

In 2010, the Miami Marlins moved all of their Major League Baseball games to then Fox Sports Florida, while the Tampa Bay Rays began carrying all their games on then Sun Sports. Prior to 2009, some Rays games were available on broadcast television stations in the state via a network made up of the state&#x27;s Ion Television stations.

<doc id="674956" wikidata="Q2135883" url="?curid=674956" title="Red Abbey, Cork">
<text>The Red Abbey in Cork, Ireland was a 14th-century Augustinian abbey which took its name from the reddish sandstone used in construction. Today all that remains of the structure is the central bell tower of the abbey church, which is one of the last remaining visible structures dating to the medieval walled town of Cork.

==History==

The Red Abbey was built in Cork in either the late 13th or early 14th centuries, though it was definitely in existence sometime before 1306. It was founded by a member of the De Courcey family. Despite being dissolved in 1541, it was occupied by the friars until at least the rebellion of 1641, and possibly as late as 1700.

The abbey tower was used by John Churchill (later the Duke of Marlborough) as a vantage point and battery during the Siege of Cork in 1690. The siege sought to suppress an uprising in the city and its association with the expelled Catholic King of England, James II.

In the eighteenth century, the Augustinian friars established a new friary in Fishamble Lane, and the Red Abbey was turned over to use as a sugar refinery. However, a fire in the refinery destroyed much of the abbey&#x27;s structure in 1799.

The remains of the monastery were excavated in 1977. Fragmented human bones, pottery spanning from medieval up to the 19th century was uncovered, along with approximately 300 pieces of lead shot. All that remains today of the structure is the bell tower of the abbey&#x27;s church. The tower is designated as a national monument and maintained by Cork City Council.

==Notable people==
* William Tirry (1609–1654), a friar of the abbey&#x27;s Augustinian order who was executed following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and beatified in 1992 as one of the Irish Catholic Martyrs.

<text>San Pablo Casacuarán is a small town located in the southern region of the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Commonly known just as Casacuarán, it stands on the road connecting the cities of Yuriria, Santiago Maravatio and Salvatierra. Every January the town has a celebration of San Pablo on January 25. The celebration goes from January 18–25 with a huge procession down main street from the top to the bottom of the town on its last day. The celebration consists of folkloric dance presentations and many shows and award ceremonies. There is also a huge carnival that goes on for the days of the fiesta; on the last two days of the celebration there are jaripeos (rodeos).

== Demographics ==
A census conducted in the year 2000 shows there is a population of 3,398.

== Geography ==

<doc id="674962" wikidata="Q1195972" url="?curid=674962" title="Page table">
<text>A page table is a data structure used by a virtual memory system in a computer to store mappings between virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses are used by the program executed by the accessing process, while physical addresses are used by the hardware, or more specifically, by the random-access memory (RAM) subsystem. The page table is a key component of virtual address translation that is necessary to access data in memory. The page table is set up by the computer&#x27;s operating system, and may be read and written during the virtual address translation process by the memory management unit or by low-level system software or firmware.

== Role of the page table ==
In operating systems that use virtual memory, every process is given the impression that it is working with large, contiguous sections of memory. Physically, the memory of each process may be dispersed across different areas of physical memory, or may have been moved (paged out) to secondary storage, typically to a hard disk drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD).

When a process requests access to data in its memory, it is the responsibility of the operating system to map the virtual address provided by the process to the physical address of the actual memory where that data is stored. The page table is where mappings of virtual addresses to physical addresses are stored, with each mapping also known as a &quot;page table entry&quot; (PTE).

== The translation process ==
The memory management unit (MMU) inside the CPU stores a cache of recently used mappings from the operating system&#x27;s page table. This is called the translation lookaside buffer (TLB), which is an associative cache.

When a virtual address needs to be translated into a physical address, the TLB is searched first. If a match is found, which is known as a &quot;TLB hit&quot;, the physical address is returned and memory access can continue. However, if there is no match, which is called a &quot;TLB miss&quot;, the MMU, the system firmware, or the operating system&#x27;s TLB miss handler will typically look up the address mapping in the page table to see whether a mapping exists, which is called a &quot;page walk&quot;. If one exists, it is written back to the TLB, which must be done because the hardware accesses memory through the TLB in a virtual memory system, and the faulting instruction is restarted, which may happen in parallel as well. The subsequent translation will result in a TLB hit, and the memory access will continue.

== Translation failures ==
The page table lookup may fail, triggering a page fault, for two reasons: 
* The lookup may fail if there is no translation available for the virtual address, meaning that virtual address is invalid. This will typically occur because of a programming error, and the operating system must take some action to deal with the problem. On modern operating systems, it will cause a segmentation fault signal being sent to the offending program.
* The lookup may also fail if the page is currently not resident in physical memory. This will occur if the requested page has been moved out of physical memory to make room for another page. In this case the page is paged out to a secondary store located on a medium such as a hard disk drive (this secondary store, or &quot;backing store&quot;, is often called a &quot;swap partition&quot; if it is a disk partition, or a &quot;swap file&quot;, &quot;swapfile&quot; or &quot;page file&quot; if it is a file). When this happens the page needs to be taken from disk and put back into physical memory. A similar mechanism is used for memory-mapped files, which are mapped to virtual memory and loaded to physical memory on demand.

When physical memory is not full this is a simple operation; the page is written back into physical memory, the page table and TLB are updated, and the instruction is restarted. However, when physical memory is full, one or more pages in physical memory will need to be paged out to make room for the requested page. The page table needs to be updated to mark that the pages that were previously in physical memory are no longer there, and to mark that the page that was on disk is now in physical memory. The TLB also needs to be updated, including removal of the paged-out page from it, and the instruction restarted. Which page to page out is the subject of page replacement algorithms.

Some MMUs trigger a page fault for other reasons, whether or not the page is currently resident in physical memory and mapped into the virtual address space of a process:
* Attempting to write when the page table has the read-only bit set causes a page fault. This is a normal part of many operating system&#x27;s implementation of copy-on-write; it may also occur when a write is done to a location from which the process is allowed to read but to which it is not allowed to write, in which case a signal is delivered to the process.
* Attempting to execute code when the page table has the NX bit (no-execute bit) set in the page table causes a page fault. This can be used by an operating system, in combination with the read-only bit, to provide a Write XOR Execute feature that stops some kinds of exploits.

== Frame table data ==
The simplest page table systems often maintain a frame table and a page table. The frame table holds information about which frames are mapped. In more advanced systems, the frame table can also hold information about which address space a page belongs to, statistics information, or other background information.

== Page table data ==

The page table is an array of page table entries.

=== Page table entry ===

Each page table entry (PTE) holds the mapping between a virtual address of a page and the address of a physical frame. There is also auxiliary information about the page such as a present bit, a dirty or modified bit, address space or process ID information, amongst others.

Secondary storage, such as a hard disk drive, can be used to augment physical memory. Pages can be paged in and out of physical memory and the disk. The present bit can indicate what pages are currently present in physical memory or are on disk, and can indicate how to treat these different pages, i.e. whether to load a page from disk and page another page in physical memory out.

The dirty bit allows for a performance optimization. A page on disk that is paged in to physical memory, then read from, and subsequently paged out again does not need to be written back to disk, since the page has not changed. However, if the page was written to after it is paged in, its dirty bit will be set, indicating that the page must be written back to the backing store. This strategy requires that the backing store retain a copy of the page after it is paged in to memory. When a dirty bit is not used, the backing store need only be as large as the instantaneous total size of all paged-out pages at any moment. When a dirty bit is used, at all times some pages will exist in both physical memory and the backing store.

In operating systems that are not single address space operating systems, address space or process ID information is necessary so the virtual memory management system knows what pages to associate to what process. Two processes may use two identical virtual addresses for different purposes. The page table must supply different virtual memory mappings for the two processes. This can be done by assigning the two processes distinct address map identifiers, or by using process IDs. Associating process IDs with virtual memory pages can also aid in selection of pages to page out, as pages associated with inactive processes, particularly processes whose code pages have been paged out, are less likely to be needed immediately than pages belonging to active processes.

As an alternative to tagging page table entries with process-unique identifiers, the page table itself may occupy a different virtual-memory page for each process so that the page table becomes a part of the process context. In such an implementation, the process&#x27;s page table can be paged out whenever the process is no longer resident in memory.

== Page table types ==
There are several types of page tables, which are optimized for different requirements. Essentially, a bare-bones page table must store the virtual address, the physical address that is &quot;under&quot; this virtual address, and possibly some address space information.

=== Inverted page tables ===
An &quot;inverted page table&quot; (IPT) is best thought of as an off-chip extension of the TLB which uses normal system RAM. Unlike a true page table, it is not necessarily able to hold all current mappings. The operating system must be prepared to handle misses, just as it would with a MIPS-style software-filled TLB.

The IPT combines a page table and a &quot;frame table&quot; into one data structure. At its core is a fixed-size table with the number of rows equal to the number of frames in memory. If there are 4,000 frames, the inverted page table has 4,000 rows. For each row there is an entry for the virtual page number (VPN), the physical page number (not the physical address), some other data and a means for creating a collision chain, as we will see later.

Searching through all entries of the core IPT structure is inefficient, and a hash table may be used to map virtual addresses (and address space/PID information if need be) to an index in the IPT - this is where the collision chain is used. This hash table is known as a &quot;hash anchor table&quot;. The hashing function is not generally optimized for coverage - raw speed is more desirable. Of course, hash tables experience collisions. Due to this chosen hashing function, we may experience a lot of collisions in usage, so for each entry in the table the VPN is provided to check if it is the searched entry or a collision.

In searching for a mapping, the hash anchor table is used. If no entry exists, a page fault occurs. Otherwise, the entry is found. Depending on the architecture, the entry may be placed in the TLB again and the memory reference is restarted, or the collision chain may be followed until it has been exhausted and a page fault occurs.

A virtual address in this schema could be split into two, the first half being a virtual page number and the second half being the offset in that page.

A major problem with this design is poor cache locality caused by the hash function. Tree-based designs avoid this by placing the page table entries for adjacent pages in adjacent locations, but an inverted page table destroys spatial locality of reference by scattering entries all over. An operating system may minimize the size of the hash table to reduce this problem, with the trade-off being an increased miss rate.

There is normally one hash table, contiguous in physical memory, shared by all processes. A per-process identifier is used to disambiguate the pages of different processes from each other. It is somewhat slow to remove the page table entries of a given process; the OS may avoid reusing per-process identifier values to delay facing this. Alternatively, per-process hash tables may be used, but they are impractical because of memory fragmentation, which requires the tables to be pre-allocated.

Inverted page tables are used for example on the PowerPC, the UltraSPARC and the IA-64 architecture.

=== Multilevel page tables ===

The inverted page table keeps a listing of mappings installed for all frames in physical memory. However, this could be quite wasteful. Instead of doing so, we could create a page table structure that contains mappings for virtual pages. It is done by keeping several page tables that cover a certain block of virtual memory. For example, we can create smaller 1024-entry 4 KB pages that cover 4 MB of virtual memory.

This is useful since often the top-most parts and bottom-most parts of virtual memory are used in running a process - the top is often used for text and data segments while the bottom for stack, with free memory in between. The multilevel page table may keep a few of the smaller page tables to cover just the top and bottom parts of memory and create new ones only when strictly necessary.

Now, each of these smaller page tables are linked together by a master page table, effectively creating a tree data structure. There need not be only two levels, but possibly multiple ones. For example, a virtual address in this schema could be split into three parts: the index in the root page table, the index in the sub-page table, and the offset in that page.

Multilevel page tables are also referred to as &quot;hierarchical page tables&quot;.

=== Virtualized page tables ===
It was mentioned that creating a page table structure that contained mappings for every virtual page in the virtual address space could end up being wasteful. But, we can get around the excessive space concerns by putting the page table in virtual memory, and letting the virtual memory system manage the memory for the page table.

However, part of this linear page table structure must always stay resident in physical memory in order to prevent circular page faults and look for a key part of the page table that is not present in the page table.

=== Nested page tables ===
Nested page tables can be implemented to increase the performance of hardware virtualization. By providing hardware support for page-table virtualization, the need to emulate is greatly reduced. For x86 virtualization the current choices are Intel&#x27;s Extended Page Table feature and AMD&#x27;s Rapid Virtualization Indexing feature.

<doc id="674969" wikidata="Q945313" url="?curid=674969" title="Cassone">
<text>A cassone (plural &quot;cassoni&quot;) or marriage chest is a rich and showy Italian type of chest, which may be inlaid or carved, prepared with gesso ground then painted and gilded. &quot;Pastiglia&quot; was decoration in low relief carved or moulded in gesso, and was very widely used. The cassone (&quot;large chest&quot;) was one of the trophy furnishings of rich merchants and aristocrats in Italian culture, from the Late Middle Ages onward. The cassone was the most important piece of furniture of that time. It was given to a bride and placed in the bridal suite. It would be given to the bride during the wedding, and it was the bride&#x27;s parents&#x27; contribution to the wedding.

There are in fact a variety of different terms used in contemporary records for chests, and the attempts by modern scholars to distinguish between them remain speculative, and all decorated chests are today usually called &quot;cassoni&quot;, which was probably not the case at the time. For example, a &quot;forziere&quot; probably denoted a decorated chest with a lock.

Since a cassone contained the personal goods of the bride, it was a natural vehicle for painted decoration commemorating the marriage in heraldry and, when figural painted panels began to be included in the decor from the early &quot;quattrocento&quot;, flattering allegory. The side panels offered a flat surface for a suitable painting, with subjects drawn from courtly romance or, much less often, religious subjects. By the 15th century subjects from classical mythology or history became the most popular. Great Florentine artists of the 15th century were called upon to decorate &quot;cassoni&quot;, though as Vasari complains, by his time in the 16th century, artists thought such work beneath them. Some Tuscan artists in Siena and Florence specialized in such cassone panels, which were preserved as autonomous works of art by 19th century collectors and dealers, who sometimes discarded the cassone itself. From the late 1850s, neo-Renaissance cassoni were confected for dealers like William Blundell Spence, Stefano Bardini or Elia Volpi in order to present surviving cassone panels to clients in a more &quot;authentic&quot; and glamorous presentation.

A typical place for such a cassone was in a chamber at the foot of a bed that was enclosed in curtains. Such a situation is a familiar setting for depictions of the Annunciation or the Visitation of St. Anne to the Virgin Mary. A cassone was largely immovable. In a culture where chairs were reserved for important personages, often pillows scattered upon the floor of a chamber provided informal seating, and a cassone could provide both a backrest and a table surface. The symbolic &quot;humility&quot; that modern scholars read into Annunciations where the Virgin sits reading upon the floor, perhaps underestimates this familiar mode of seating.

At the end of the 15th century, a new classicising style arose, and early Renaissance cassoni of central and northern Italy were carved and partly gilded, and given classical décor, with panels flanked by fluted corner pilasters, under friezes and cornices, or with sculptural panels in high or low relief. Some early to mid-sixteenth-century cassoni drew their inspiration from Roman sarcophagi (&quot;illustration, right&quot;). By the mid-sixteenth century Giorgio Vasari could remark on the old-fashioned cassoni with painted scenes, examples of which could be seen in the palazzi of Florentine families.

A cassone that has been provided with a high panelled back and sometimes a footrest, for both hieratic and practical reasons, becomes a &quot;cassapanca&quot; (&quot;chest-bench&quot;). &quot;Cassapanche&quot; were immovably fixed in the main public room of a palazzo, the &quot;sala&quot; or &quot;salone.&quot; They were part of the &quot;immobili&quot; (&quot;unmoveables&quot;), perhaps even more than the removable glazed window casements, and might be left in place, even if the palazzo passed to another family.

In the east part of Emilia Romagna, the &quot;cassone&quot; term is also used to describe a local food, which is a round flat bread cooked on a special pan called &quot;testo&quot;.

<text>Sacavém (; ) is a city and former civil parish in the municipality of Loures, Lisbon District, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Sacavém e Prior Velho. It is a few kilometers north-east of the Portuguese capital, Lisbon. The civil parish covers an area of , and included as of 2001 census a resident population of 17,659 inhabitants. The region is known for its famous ceramics industry.

== History ==

Due to its strategic location, at the intersection of several roads from the north and east connecting to Lisbon, Sacavém was an important settlement during periods of Portuguese History, with some evidence extending back to pre-history. The Portuguese historian Pinho Leal wrote, in his chorography &quot;Portugal Antigo &amp; Moderno&quot; (&quot;Ancient &amp; Modern Portugal&quot;), that &quot;Sacavém is incontestably a very old settlement, and already existed in the time of the Romans&quot;. The oldest-known references date back to the Neolithic and Chalcolithic: three polished stone axes were discovered from the Bronze Age, and in the mid-1980s, excavations in the historical centre of the city revealed a cave with similar artifacts from this period.

By the first century, Sacavém was already crossed by two major Roman roads that connected the region with the interior of the Iberian Peninsula:
* &quot;Via XV&quot;, connecting &quot;Olissipona&quot; (Lisbon) and &quot;Emerita Augusta&quot; (Mérida), by way of the important administrative centre of &quot;Scalabicastrum&quot;, today Santarém; and
* &quot;Via XVI&quot;, which connected &quot;Olissipona&quot; to &quot;Bracara Augusta&quot; (Braga), capital of the &quot;Conventus bracarensis&quot; in the province of &quot;Gallaecia&quot;).
Remnants of these two Roman &quot;viæ&quot; still exist under the modern roads &quot;Rua do António Ricardo Rodrigues&quot; and &quot;Rua do José Luís de Morais&quot; (the town&#x27;s two main streets during the Middle Ages, which connected the upper and lower districts of Sacavém). Even during this period Sacavém was an important river-crossing; the Romans built a bridge that remained active until the 17th century (according to several sources, such as Francisco de Holanda or Miguel Leitão de Andrade). This bridge was a natural continuation of the roads and connected Sacavém with the northern river bank; therefore indirectly included in the famous Antonine Itinerary. The parish&#x27;s coat-of-arms includes a symbolic depiction of the Roman bridge. Also in the vicinity, an epigraphic inscription is said to have existed (nowadays unknown), but referred to in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum). Various epigraphs have suggested that this totem identified the Roman magisterial administration of the rural locality.

The Roman colony, which was centred on the bridge, was eventually succeeded by barbarians from south-eastern peninsula. The Alans were the first to occupy these lands (but left few remnants), and later the Visigoths, who constructed a chapel dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres&quot;, on the sight of the medieval-era Chapel of &quot;Nossa Senhora da Vitória&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Victory&quot;).

===Moorish rule===
After 711, the Moors occupied the Iberian peninsula; Lisbon () is taken in 716 by Berbers under the command of Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa (who received the governorship of Al-Andalus, in the name of the Umayyad Caliphate of Damascus), who also captured the region of Sacavém. Much like other areas of the Al-Garb Al-Andalus (much of ancient Roman Lusitania), the peoples under Moorish dominion became bi-lingual, while maintaining their Christian faith (not converting until much later). In Sacavém the community that circled the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Prazeres maintained their faith and culture (under the bishop of Lisbon), something that was possible due to the religious tolerance of the invaders to the &quot;Ahl al-Kitāb&quot; (or &quot;People of the Book&quot;). It is likely that the medieval tower in Sacavém de Cima, in the &quot;Largo do Terreirinho&quot;, fronting the Chapel of &quot;Senhora da Saúde&quot; (in the historic centre of the settlement) originated during this Muslim period, when the local Christians were required to pay jizya.

The modern name &quot;Sacavém&quot; might have come from the Arabic language; for many years experts believed that it came from the word &quot;šagabi&quot; (&quot;next&quot; or &quot;in the neighbourhood&quot; – in this case, of Lisbon, an important city even during Moorish period) latinised to &quot;sacabis, -is&quot;, becoming &quot;sacabem&quot; in the accusative case, and hence, by phonetic modifications during the centuries, &quot;Sacavém&quot;. Recent investigations, from Arabic sources (namely Yaqut&#x27;s &quot; Mu&#x27;jam Al-Buldan&quot;), indicate that the Muslims used the word &quot;Šaqabān&quot; (), incredibly similar to the modern Portuguese pronunciation.

During Al-Andalus, Sacavém was considered a &quot;qarya&quot; (one of the settlements of al-Ušbuna), but it was administratively integrated into the larger settlement (geographically limited by the Roman &quot;conventus&quot;), which was governed by the military governor in Cordova, later by the emirs (756–929) and caliphs (929–1031) that governed Al-Andalus. Various seditions against the Umayyad Caliphate rose-up in the emirs and caliphates of Al-Garb Al-Andalus; the revolts of Ibn Marwan of Mérida/Badajoz or Umār ibn Hafsūn of Bobastro corresponds to a period of weak central government, when the Al Garb was a nominal extension of the Caliphate, an autonomous principality with its seat in Batalyaws (Badajoz).

It was in the period of turmoil preceding the fall of the Caliphates (in 1031) that Sacavém was integrated into the Kingdom of Badajoz (except for a decade around 1020 when it was a part of al-Ušbuna, under ʿAbd al-ʿAziz ibn Sabūr and ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Sabūr (sons of Sabūr al-Saqlabi, a Slavic serf who sparked a revolt in against Caliph Al-Hakam II). This would last until the Aftasids conquered the region. In 1093, in a trade for aid against the Almoravids (from the Maghreb), the emir of Badajoz ceded to the &quot;imperator totius Hispaniæ&quot; Alfonso VI of León and Castile the castles of al-Ušbuna and aš-Šantaryin (Santarém), along with the territory of Sacavém. But the regions return to Christianity lasted for a short time; in 1095, with the advance of the Almoravid forces, led by Yusuf ibn Tashfin, Count Raymond of Galicia was defeated in battle, resulting in the Arab-Christian frontier advancing from the Tagus River to the Mondego. By 1144, the Al-Garb led by Ibn Qasi revolted against the Almoravids. Although the Almoravids were dominant in the first few years, they were in decline when Afonso I of Portugal definitively captured Lisbon (al-Ušbuna) in October 1147.

===Middle Ages===

According to an old legend, it was near the bank of the Trancão that the mythical battle of Sacavém river took place, between King Afonso I of Portugal and the Moors, in October 1147. The tradition (fixed probably in the 16th century) says that the Moorish people had gathered around 5,000 men from all Estremadura (Alenquer, Óbidos, Tomar, Torres Novas and Torres Vedras) to fight against only 1,500 Christians, but the latter defeated the Muslims in a large blood bath, with this wondrous victory personally attributed to the intervention of the Holy Virgin, which brought many Christians speaking strange languages (this is, the crusades that took Lisbon that same year).

The legend says also that the Moorish leader Bezai Zaide had even converted to Christianity and became the first priest at the &quot;Chapel of Our Lady of Martyrs&quot; () that Afonso Henriques ordered to be built just a few days after the clash. On the other hand, the first Portuguese monarch had also ordered the rebuilding of the old Visigoth &quot;Chapel of Our Lady of Pleasures&quot; (), ruined during the Moorish rule (although Christian faith in Al-Andalus was allowed by the emirs against the payment of a tribute). This church was dedicated to &quot;Our Lady of Victory&quot; (), and became the seat of the ecclesiastical parish.

However, the first documented mention of Sacavém is in 1191 (forty-four years after the conquest), in a paper signed by King Sancho I of Portugal.

Pinho Leal reported that in the 12th century Sacavém was a parish with 900 houses, but this number is, however, is regarded today as too high for that time. During the 13th century, it seems that in Sacavém there existed an important Jewish community, living in a ghetto outside the parish.

In 1288, the priest of Sacavém was one of the signatories of a letter requesting that the Pope Nicholas IV install a university in Lisbon.

At the end of the 14th century, king Ferdinand I of Portugal donated Sacavém to his wife Leonor Telles de Menezes. Although the place belonged at that time thus to the sphere of influence of the queen-consort, it supported the later King John I of Portugal in his struggle for power. Therefore, after his triumph in 1385, Sacavém was administratively included in Lisbon, but donated to the major supporter of the new king, Nuno Álvares Pereira. Later, by the wedding of his daughter to the first Duke of Braganza, Sacavém became a property of the powerful House of Braganza.

São João da Talha, until then known as &quot;Sacavém Extra-Muros&quot; (&quot;Sacavém outside the walls&quot;) became an independent parish, split from Sacavém in 1387.

In the Late Middle Ages, several chronicles (such as those of Duarte Nunes de Leão and Rui de Pina) mentioned Sacavém. These two chroniclers stated that the royal family, before the conquest of Ceuta in 1415, fled to Sacavém, in order to escape from the plague that arose in Lisbon. There the queen-consort Philippa of Lancaster died of the plague, her body was carried to Batalha Monastery where her remains were buried. However, another chronicler, Gomes Eanes de Zurara reports that the royal family fled to Odivelas (and therefore not to Sacavém), and that the queen died there.

===The Modern Era===
The Fort of Sacavém was built in 1892 as the easternmost of a line of forts designed to circle Lisbon, known as the &quot;Entrenched Field of Lisbon&quot; (&quot;Campo Entrincheirado de Lisboa&quot;). It now houses important government archives. Taking advantage of its proximity to the River Tagus and opportunities presented by the opening of a railway line to the north of Lisbon, Sacavém became an important area for Portugal&#x27;s industrial development from the middle of the 19th century. The first significant factory, the &quot;Fábrica da Loiça&quot;, produced crockery and ceramics. Now closed, it is now celebrated at the Ceramics Museum of Sacavém, which also has a documentation centre covering the industrial development of the town.

Sacavém was the site of Portugal&#x27;s first fatal aviation accident on June 13, 1913. Giovanni Manio lost control of his Blériot monoplane at 450 feet during a display flight, being thrown from the cockpit and fatally striking his propeller before he hit the ground. The plane was written off.

== Geography ==

Sacavém is located in the eastern part of Loures municipality, bordering the parishes of Unhos (northwest), Camarate (west), Prior Velho (southwest), Portela (south) as well as Moscavide (southeast). To the east lies the Tagus River, and to north the Trancão River (formerly known as &quot;Sacavém River&quot;), separating Sacavém from Bobadela parish. The &quot;Ribeira do Prior Velho&quot;, also flows through the city crossing it in underground channels.

The parish&#x27;s terrain is relatively flat. The northern bank of the Tagus is approximately at sea level, while the border of Sacavém with the parishes of Camarate and Unhos is above the sea. However, there are several hills such as &quot;Monte Cintra&quot; and &quot;Monte do Convento&quot; (both reaching about in height).

Traditionally, Sacavém has been divided in two areas:
* &quot;Sacavém de Cima&quot; (&quot;Upper Sacavém&quot;), comprising the historical center of the town, around the &quot;Capela de Nossa Senhora da Saúde e de Santo André&quot; (&quot;Chapel of Our Lady of Health and Saint Andrew&quot;);
* &quot;Sacavém de Baixo&quot; (&quot;Lower Sacavém&quot;), near the bank of the Trancão River, where the parochial Church and the old monastery of the Order of Poor Clares are situated.

In the last few decades, besides these two urban areas, new urban agglomerations have emerged, such as &quot;Courela do Foguete&quot;, &quot;Fonte Perra&quot;, &quot;Olival Covo&quot;, &quot;Quinta do Património&quot; and &quot;Real Forte&quot;, as well as &quot;Terraços da Ponte&quot;. The latter area replaced the old and much degraded &quot;Quinta do Mocho&quot; zone, which was the centre an African emigrant community, from the former Portuguese colonies, that returned to Portugal after the Carnation Revolution in 1974, and whom lived in poor conditions, over the past three decades.

==Architecture==
The parish of Sacavém is region of several nationally and regionally recognizable architectural monuments, although many are not classified as architecturally significant under the auspices of the IGESPAR designations. Many of these structures include buildings dating back to the Baroque and late medieval period of Portuguese growth.

===Civic===
* Arch of Largo do Olaio (); an 18th- and 19th-century entrance to the Cabrias family estate;
* Barrio of Quinta da Vitória ()
* Residence Largo Pedro Gomes Junior (); 18th-century residence with dependencies within walls, adapted for bourgeois use;
* Residence Quinta de São José (), a residence located on the grounds of the São José estate, with ceilings of painted wood and silars of figurative azueljo;
* Residence Praça da Republica, No.18–21 (), a striking salmon-colored residence designed in the 20th century;
* Residence Praceta D. João I (), the ruins of a large signeurial house, in an advance state of ruin, but dating to the 19th or early 20th century;
* Residence Rua Tenente Possidónio Coelho, No.14–18 (), another 20th-century two-storey residence, integrated into a concentrated urban environment;

===Religious===
* Convent of the Poor Clares and Church of Nossa Senhora da Purificação (), the Mannerist architecture devoted originally to the monastery of the Poor Clares Xabreganas, and later operated by the Ministry of War, before being plans were established to convert the spaces into commercial and leisure services, a civic centre and local &quot;Junta de Freguesia&quot;;

<doc id="674979" wikidata="Q870060" url="?curid=674979" title="Cryptex">
<text>The word cryptex is a neologism coined by the author Dan Brown for his 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, denoting a portable used to hide secret messages. It is a word formed from Greek &quot;kryptós&quot;, &quot;hidden, secret&quot; and Latin &quot;codex&quot;; &quot;an apt title for this device&quot; since it uses &quot;the science of &quot;cryptology&quot; to protect information written on the contained scroll or &quot;codex&quot;&quot; (p. 199 of the novel). The first physical cryptex was created by Justin Kirk Nevins in 2004.

== Design and function ==
The (first) cryptex featured in the novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is described as a stone cylinder comprising &quot;five doughnut-sized disks of marble [that] had been stacked and affixed to one another within a delicate brass framework&quot;; end caps make it impossible to see inside the hollow cylinder. Each of the disks is carved with the entire alphabet and can be rotated independently of the others to create different letter-alignment combinations, including but not limited to words, initialisms, and anagrams. Although it is not clear whether the alphabet in question preserves the U/V and/or I/J distinctions and/or includes the letter W, when only the alignment of the disks with respect to each other is considered, the number of potential combinations is between 234 (279,841) and 264 (456,976); if the mechanism treats combinations having the same disk alignment but different degrees of rotation around the cylinder&#x27;s long axis as distinct, as does a multiple-wheel combination lock or slot machine employing an indicator bar along which the specified numbers are to be aligned, this number rises to between 235 (6,436,343) and 265 (11,881,376).

The cryptex works &quot;much like a bicycle&#x27;s combination lock&quot;, and if one arranges the disks to spell out the correct password, &quot;the tumblers inside align, and the entire cylinder slides apart&quot; (p. 200). In the inner compartment of the cryptex, secret information can be hidden, written on a scroll of thin papyrus (sometimes inside another smaller cryptex) wrapped around a fragile vial of vinegar as a security measure: if one does not know the password but tries to force the cryptex open, the vial will break and the vinegar will dissolve the papyrus before it can be read.

==In popular culture==
* In Season 4, episode 14 of the TV series &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Ron helps Ben open a cryptex that Leslie has given him in an elaborate Valentine&#x27;s Day scavenger hunt.
* In &quot;The Brothers Grimoire&quot;, a second-season episode of the American TV series &quot;Witches of East End&quot;, Dash and Killian inherit a cryptex from their mother.
* On the NBC American reality series &quot;Treasure Hunters&quot;, nested cryptex were among the puzzles that challenged contestants, and were used in the finale.
* In &quot;Phased and Confused&quot;, a season 3 episode of the American TV series &quot;Eureka&quot;, a nearly-unbreakable cryptex is the key to a hidden underground bunker.
* In episode 88 of the South Korean variety show &quot;Running Man&quot;, the cast members must find clues attached to other staff members to open their cryptex.
* In &quot;Down the Rabbit Hole&quot;, a fourth season episode of the American TV series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, depicts a sword with a cryptex under its hilt.
* In &quot;The Blame Game&quot;, a Season 8 episode of the American TV series &quot;Castle&quot;, one of the puzzles the characters need to solve involves a cryptex.
* In &quot;Valley of the Wolves&quot;, the head of the mafia has a cryptex to store his diary narrating his actions and political connections.
* The Wii version of &quot;Tomb Raider: Anniversary&quot; features cryptex puzzles that Lara Croft must solve to activate certain mechanisms. The solution to each cryptex puzzle can be found in its vicinity. When Lara makes a rubbing of the puzzle, the player is given a limited number of disk rotations to reproduce the solution before the cryptex resets. In more difficult puzzles, rotating one disk will cause one or more disks to rotate simultaneously.
* The 2009 first-person shooter &quot;The Conduit&quot; features hidden &quot;pyramid lock&quot; puzzles that function like cryptexes, which can be solved to open secret weapon caches. They resemble the Eye of Providence with three incomplete concentric rings directly above it that must be rotated such that none of them overlap with the symbol&#x27;s pyramid. In more difficult pyramid lock puzzles, rotating one ring in a certain direction may cause one or two other rings to rotate simultaneously.
* In series 9, episode 6 of the British comedy panel game show &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, comedian Rose Matafeo presents a cryptex as her offering for the prize category &quot;The Thing That, If You Found It In a Field, You&#x27;d Be Most Pleased About&quot;.

<text>Nizza (also Barbera d&#x27;Asti Superiore Nizza before 2014) is a DOCG red Italian wine produced in the northern Italian region of Piedmont. It is made from the Barbera grape, and the zone of production is limited to the &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) of Agliano Terme, Belveglio, Bruno, Calamandrana, Castel Boglione, Castelnuovo Belbo, Castelnuovo Calcea, Castel Rocchero, Cortiglione, Incisa Scapaccino, Moasca, Mombaruzzo, Mombercelli, Nizza Monferrato, Rocchetta Palafea, San Marzano Oliveto, Vaglio Serra and Vinchio within the province of Asti. In this area Barbera is the leading grape variety grown, because the pedoclimatic conditions here are particularly favourable for its ripening.

The zone of production is centered on the town of Nizza Monferrato, from which the wine derives its name.

==History==

Nizza was promoted to DOCG status in 2014. Before that date it had been a &quot;Superiore&quot; subzone of the Barbera d&#x27;Asti DOCG.

==DOCG regulations==

Nizza production rules specify:
* Grape composition: 100% Barbera
* Maximum yield: 7 tonnes/ha
* Minimum alcohol: 13% (13.5% if a single vineyard is named on the label)
* Minimum barrel aging: 6 months (or 12 months for wine labelled &#x27;Riserva&#x27;)
* Minimum total aging: 18 months (or 30 months for wine labelled &#x27;Riserva&#x27;)

==Environment==

Nizza vines are sun-demanding and normally occupy the best-exposed slopes that face from southeast to west; the valleys are excluded. The production area is the focus of the so-called Tertiary Piedmont Basin, a hilly region that originated from the lifting of the seabed during the late Tertiary epoch; the soils are calcareous, of medium depth, and characterized by sandy-clay marls and stratified sandstones.

<text>Phil of the Future is an American science fiction comedy television series that originally aired on Disney Channel from June 18, 2004, to August 19, 2006, for two seasons. The series was created by Douglas Tuber and Tim Maile and produced by 2121 Productions. It follows a family from the future that gets stranded in the 21st century when their time machine breaks down.

==Characters==
===Main===
*Philip &quot;Phil&quot; Rupert Diffy (Ricky Ullman) (born 2107) is the main character in the series. He is a freshman in Season 1 and sophomore in Season 2, at H.G. Wells Junior/Senior High School. He seems to be the most &quot;in tune&quot; with how things work in this century. Phil frequently has to make up excuses to hide the fact that he is from the future. He is the best friend and later boyfriend of Keely Teslow. Phil is two years older than Pim.
*Pimilla &quot;Pim&quot; Nicole Diffy (Amy Bruckner) (born 2109) is Phil&#x27;s younger sister by two years. She is a 7th (Season 1) / 8th (Season 2) grader at H.G. Wells Junior/Senior High. Pim is a mischievous girl who is constantly up to no good and is even prone to megalomania. Pim is especially known for liking to pull pranks on people, mainly on Phil, Debbie Berwick, and Vice Principal Hackett. In the second season, she hangs out with a young boy named &quot;Li&#x27;l Danny&quot; Dawkins. She also tries to avoid Debbie Berwick and Candida. Repeatedly in the show, she looks for ways to dominate the world and universe. Though Pim often causes trouble for Phil and has a tough attitude, she cares about her brother, but keeps it hidden most of the time.
*Lloyd Diffy (Craig Anton) (born 2074) is Phil and Pim&#x27;s goofy dad, who is working on repairing the time machine. He was an engineer in 2121, and loves &quot;older music.&quot; He is paranoid about the government (and Vice Principal Hackett) figuring out that his family and he are from the future. During the Diffys&#x27; stay, Lloyd and Curtis get jobs at the Mantis hardware store. Lloyd is two years older than Barb.
*Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Diffy (Lise Simms) (née Speckle; born 2076) is Phil and Pim&#x27;s mom. She is very interested in how things work in this century. Unlike other mothers, though, Barbara seems to let her kids figure things out on their own. She loves to cook the old fashioned way; however, her food usually ends up with something being wrong, because in 2121 they spray food out of a can. Promotional material described her as having an artificial body, but this was never seen in the series. She forces Pim to be friends with Debbie, though Pim hates Debbie. Her maiden name is revealed in the episode &quot;Not So Great-Great-Grandpa.&quot;
*Keely Teslow (Alyson Michalka) (born March 1990) is Phil&#x27;s best friend and later girlfriend. She is the only person who knows Phil and his family are from the future. Keely is an energetic and bubbly girl who aspires to be a news reporter. She starts to harbor romantic feelings for Phil during Season 2. She sometimes uses Phil&#x27;s gadgets as a shortcut for schoolwork. She is notable on the show for her numerous hairstyles and colorful clothes. In the later episodes of the series, she hosts her own daily news program on the school&#x27;s closed-circuit television broadcasting system. In the episode &quot;The Giggle,&quot; she gets to look ahead at her own future and learns that she does, in fact, become a successful news reporter. It is also noted that she is wearing a wedding ring, but turns down the chance to see who her husband is. In the final episode, Phil and Keely finally reveal their feelings for each other and start dating after being voted &quot;Cutest Couple&quot; by their school. However, shortly after they begin dating, Pim helps Lloyd finally repair the time machine, and their relationship comes to an end as Phil returns to 2121.

===Recurring===
*Curtis (J. P. Manoux) (born around 30,000 BC) is a caveman (Cro-Magnon, as mentioned in the episode &quot;Dinner Time&quot;) who stowed away in the Diffys&#x27; time machine when they went back to visit the Stone Age. The Diffys struggle to make Curtis seem like a normal person, and often pretends that he is Phil&#x27;s uncle. Throughout the series, he learns more English.
*Vice Principal Neil Hackett (J.P. Manoux) (born 1969) is the Vice Principal at Phil, Keely, and Pim&#x27;s school, H.G. Wells Junior/Senior High School. In the school, he is also Phil&#x27;s teacher in science and Pim&#x27;s teacher in history. He is often found snooping around the Diffys&#x27; house as he tries to figure out where they are really from, though he believes they are aliens. He is the main antagonist of the series. Other than Keely, he is the only person to find out that Phil and his family are from the future. This is short lived however as The Diffys travel back in time before they ever told him.

====Season 1====
*Deborah Hortence &quot;Debbie&quot; Berwick (Kay Panabaker) (born 1990) is the complete opposite of Pim and she has a very happy attitude towards life. She hardly ever gets mad and is very nice. Debbie also considers Pim to be her best friend. Because of this, Pim likes to take advantage of Debbie&#x27;s good-natured personality. She lives with her grandma and teaches a yoga class. Her other friends are Neckbrace Lana and Silent Judy. Debbie used to date Bradley until Pim broke them up by changing Debbie&#x27;s personality but Debbie went back to normal. Debbie enjoys singing and is in the school band. She was written out of the show after Season 1. It was revealed in the Halloween special that she was a &quot;happy&quot; cyborg made by a cyborg-making company. She was intended to only do good and be always happy, until finally having a malfunction and turning evil and attempting to &quot;nicely&quot; enslave the world (starting from her schoolmates) into baking cupcakes for charity. At the episode&#x27;s conclusion, Phil was forced to melt her. She appeared afterwards in the episode &quot;Neander-Phil&quot;.
*Bradley Benjamin Farmer (Rory Thost) is Pim&#x27;s rival in Season 1. He is made fun of his short height (constantly being called a munchkin by Pim). He dated Debbie but Pim broke them up and he became infatuated with Pim.
*Neckbrace Lana (Carlie Westerman) is a girl who did the school news and was in Pim&#x27;s grade. She and Pim hated each other. She always wears a neckbrace, as she had pinched a nerve at some time in the past.
*Tia Deanna Fedichelli (Brenda Song) is Keely&#x27;s best friend. She is popular and friendly. She also seems to be rich. Though she can be spoiled and snobby sometimes, she is friendly and described as the girl next door by Phil; replaced by Via in Season 2, due to Brenda Song leaving the show to star in &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot;.
*Seth Wosmer (Evan Peters) is the nerdy friend of Phil, Keely, and Tia. He is a member of the H.G. Wells billiards team, and the first student at the school to befriend Phil. His role was replaced by the more suave Owen in Season 2.
*Ms. Guinevere Winston (Suzanne Krull) is a second-grade teacher in Season 1 (whose writing class Phil had to attend in the episode &quot;Tanner&quot;), as well as Pim&#x27;s teacher.
*Tanner Kirkpatrick (Chris Hunter) is a crush of Keely&#x27;s in the episode &quot;Your Cheatin&#x27; Heart&quot; and was in the show most of the season. Phil seems to dislike him and sometimes cracks jokes about him and vice-versa, especially after Phil caught him cheating on Keely.

====Season 2====
*Candida (Spencer Locke) is the &quot;mean&quot; girl that excludes Pim and insults her by frequently referring to her as &quot;Pim-ple.&quot; She is referred to as one of the &quot;fashion zombies&quot; by Pim.
*Li&#x27;l Danny Dawkins (Brandon Smith) has a crush on Pim and always gets involved with her antics. Pim does not seem to show affection for him, with the exception of when they danced at the dance in the episode &quot;Get Ready to Go-Go.&quot;
*Joel Messerschmitt (Joel Brooks) is Phil and Keely&#x27;s teacher who takes pleasure in giving extremely difficult assignments that most of his students will fail. He has a sister named Bettina (also played by Brooks) and a nephew, Nathan (Josh Flitter), who both shockingly carry the same family trait of having a mustache. He reveals in the episode &quot;The Gile&quot; that his parents were acrobats.
*Owen (Michael Mitchell) is Phil&#x27;s friend who replaced Seth. He is not that smart and is laid-back, also constantly trying to hit on girls (though he never succeeds).
*Olivia (&quot;Via&quot;) (Juliet Holland-Rose) is a girl from England who transferred because her father is in the military. She became friends with Keely after Tia moved. In the episode &quot;Get Ready to Go-Go,&quot; Phil went to a Sadie Hawkins dance with her, after a near-miss in returning to the future ruined his plans to go with Keely.

<doc id="675000" wikidata="Q7102059" url="?curid=675000" title="Organized Crime Control Act of 1970">
<text>== Lead ==
On October 15, 1970, Congress enacted the Organized Crime Control Act in response to rising apprehensions from government officials and the American public over increasing crime rates and the proliferatetion of organized crime activity in the U.S. The Organized Crime Control Act was passed in the 91st United States Congress, which, at the time, had a democratic majority in both chambers and collaborated with “tough on crime” Republican President Richard Nixon. The Organized Crime Control Act is a comprehensive, anti-crime reform bill designed to combat the evident rise of organized crime in American society.

== Background ==
The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 was a major crime reform bill. Its main purpose was to create new tools and legislation that the federal government could utilize to eradicate organized crime. Senator John M. McLellan played a pivotal role in conducting congressional investigations to uncover organized crime&#x27;s role and ascertain whether the status quo laws were effective tools to address organized crime. Before 1969, in response to these congressional investigations, government officials concluded that the tools were inadequate to address and eradicate the proliferation of the mafia, organized crime, and its infiltration in American society. Federal jurisdiction was restricted in combating organized crime, the evidence-gathering process had shortcomings, and the legislation at the time obstructed efforts to expose crime leaders. Government leaders also realized that local and state governments required more funding and leadership by the federal government to help combat organized crime. Reform efforts established things like witness immunity to help uncover leaders in organized crime and made local illegal gambling a federal crime. In comprehensively reforming legislation, leaders were able to diligently investigate and punish organized crime.

== Legislative History ==
On January 10, 1969, veteran crime fighter and law advocate Senator John L. McLellan introduced President-endorsed Bill S. 30 containing 9 titles dedicated to curbing organized crime in America. The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Laws and Procedures began a hearing on March 18, 1969. The bill was later introduced in the House of Representatives on April 1, 1969, and the Senate&#x27;s Committee on the Judiciary conducted multiple hearings between August and December 1969, which resulted in a committee report on December 18, 1969. The bill was later reintroduced in the House of Representatives on January 21, 1970, while getting debated in the Senate, which resulted in its passage on January 23, 1970, with a roll-call vote of 73-1. The House&#x27;s subcommittee No. 5 began conducting hearings on May 20, 1970, and the House&#x27;s Committee on Rules and Judiciary created reports in the consequent months. On October 7, 1970, the 12-title bill S. 30, titled “The Organized Crime Control Act of 1970,” was debated, amended, and passed in the House of Representatives with a roll-call vote of 341-26. On October 12, 1970, both chambers of Congress reconciled their differences to align the bill, and President Richard Nixon signed the bill into law on October 15, 1970.

== Main Provisions ==
Title I—Special Grand Jury. This title authorizes special grand juries to convene as ordered by the Attorney General for periods of up to 36 months. These special grand juries convened under the oversight of a federal district court to return indictments and issue grand jury reports concerning governmental misconduct, legislative or executive recommendations, or organized crime.

Title II—General Immunity. This title authorizes legislative, administrative, and judicial entities to grant witnesses immunity from prosecution predicated on their testimony but not from all prosecution for any act mentioned in their testimony.

Title III—Recaltritant Witnesses. The title authorized the detention or confinement of recalcitrant witnesses linked to organized crime for a maximum of 18 months or until they comply with court orders, and without bail until compliance is achieved.

Title VIII—Syndicated Gambling. This title declared it illegal for individuals to violate state law, especially by corrupting public servants, to support an &quot;illegal gambling business.&quot; An illegal gambling business employs at least five employees, operates for over thirty days, or produces $2,000 in gross income in a single day, and it violates state or local laws.

Title IX—Racketeer Influenced And Corrupt Organizations. This title declared it a crime to utilize income obtained through organized crime to acquire, begin, or operate a business that engages in interstate commerce, and it prescribed the use of forfeiture, devices, and special investigative procedures against such crimes.

Title X—Dangerous Special Offender Sentencing. This title authorizes a federal judge to increase sentences up to 30 years for dangerous adult special offenders.

<doc id="675008" wikidata="Q6938169" url="?curid=675008" title="Murderkill River">
<text>The Murderkill River is a river flowing to Delaware Bay in central Delaware in the United States. It is approximately long and drains an area of on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

The Murderkill flows for its entire length in southern Kent County. It rises just west of Felton and flows generally east-northeastwardly, through Killen Pond (site of Killens Pond State Park) and Coursey Pond, under Carpenters Bridge, and past Frederica to Bowers, where it enters Delaware Bay about 0.5 miles (1 km) south of the mouth of the St. Jones River. The Murderkill River is tidally influenced from its mouth upstream to just past Frederica, and is considered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to be navigable for the lower 10 miles (16 km) of its course.

According to 2002 data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, 55% of the area of the Murderkill River&#x27;s watershed is occupied by agricultural uses; 17% is forested; 14% is urban; 9% is wetland; and 2% is water.

== Origin of name ==
One description of the river&#x27;s naming was recorded in 1945 by George R. Stewart, but is now considered to be a folk tale:

Dick Carter, Chair of the Delaware Heritage Commission, states that the name of Murderkill River is taken from the original Dutch for Mother River. Mother is moeder in Middle Dutch, and river is Kille. Later, under British rule, the word &quot;River&quot; was added to the waterway&#x27;s name, effectively making it &quot;mother river river.&quot; The term &quot;kill&quot; is used in areas of Dutch influence in the Netherlands&#x27; former North American colony of New Netherland, primarily the Hudson and Delaware Valleys to describe a creek, river, tidal inlet, strait, or arm of the, sea such as Bronx Kill in New York and Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania.

Delaware&#x27;s creeks and rivers are slow-moving and there is deep mud associated with marshy rivers. Dutch &quot;modder&quot; = mud, a false cognate to &quot;mother.&quot; Modder Kill = Muddy Creek or Muddy River. The word is still used in Dutch, such as this Dutch video of a tractor stuck in mud (&quot;vast in de modder&quot;).

Also, in New York there is Muddy Kill, with a clear connection to the older Dutch name.

== Variant names ==
According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Murderkill River has also been known historically as:
*Mordare Kijhlen (Swedish)
*Mother Creek
*Mother Kill
*Motherkill
*Motherkiln Creek
*Mothers Creek
*Murder Kill Creek
*Murther Creek
*Murtherkill

<text>Pietro Paolo Mennea (; 28 June 1952 – 21 March 2013), nicknamed (&quot;the Arrow of the South&quot;), was an Italian sprinter and politician. He was most successful in the 200m event, winning a gold medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and setting a world record at 19.72 seconds in September 1979. This record stood for almost 17 years – the longest duration in the event history – and is still the European record. He is the only male sprinter who has qualified at four consecutive 200 metres Olympic finals: from 1972 to 1984.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mennea, who was born in Barletta, in the Italian region of Puglia, started his long international athletic career in 1968 when he took part in a junior race in Termoli and he was registered in &quot;AVIS Barletta&quot; club; in 1971, he won the first of his 14 Italian outdoor titles in the 100 and 200 m. He went on to win two indoor titles in 60 m and 400 m, along with five Mediterranean Games gold medals in 100 m and 200 m. He competed at the European Championships with a third place in the 4 × 100 m relay. He made his Olympic debut at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, where he made the final of the 200 m, his strongest event. He finished in third place, behind Valeri Borzov and Larry Black. Three more consecutive Olympic 200 metre finals would follow later in his career, the longest run ever in this event.

At the 1974 European Championships, Mennea claimed the 200 m gold in front of his home crowd in Rome, while also placing second behind Borzov in the 100 m and the 4 × 100 m. After some poor performances in the 1976 Olympic season, Mennea decided to skip the Olympics, but when the Italian public protested Mennea went to Montreal. He finished fourth in the 200 m and sixth in the 4 × 100 m relay. In 1977, he finished second in the world cup 200, where a photo finish separated him from Clancy Edwards of the United States. He successfully defended his European 200 m title in 1978 but displayed his capabilities in the 100 metres by also winning that event in Prague.

===200 metres world record===
In 1979, Mennea placed first in the 100 metres and second in the 200 m behind Allan Wells of Great Britain in the European Cup. Later in the year, aged 27, he took part in the World University Games, which were held on the high-altitude track of Mexico City. On 12 September 1979, he won the 200 metres with a time of 19.72. His time set a new world record, beating Tommie Smith&#x27;s time of 19.83 set on the same track in the 1968 Summer Olympics. The record held for almost seventeen years before Michael Johnson broke it at the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials. As of November 2020, only seventeen athletes have recorded a better time over 200 metres than Mennea. His time stands as the current European record. He also held the low-altitude world record, 19.96, from 1980 to 1983, set in his home town of Barletta. On 17 August 1980, Mennea became the first sprinter to run under 20 seconds for the 200 metres three times.

===Olympic champion===
Entering the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Mennea was a clear favourite for the Olympic gold, in part because of the United States boycott of the Moscow Olympics. In the 200 metre final, Mennea faced reigning champion Don Quarrie and 100 metre champion Allan Wells. Mennea drew the outer most lane with Wells in lane 7 to his inside. Wells got out to a blistering fast start and closed on Mennea within the first 50 m. They approached the straight with Wells more than a two-metre lead on Mennea with Quarrie in second and Silvio Leonard, hampered by his lane 1 draw, in fourth. However, in the straight Mennea gained ground and passed Quarrie and Leonard and at the very end of the race, just beating Wells, winning the gold by a mere 0.02 seconds. Later in the games, he was the anchor man on the Italian bronze medal winning 4 × 400 relay team. He also competed in the 100 metres, reaching the semi-finals.

===Last years===
In 1983, in Cassino, he clocked a manual 14.8 seconds in 150 metres, a world best time that he held until it was bettered by Usain Bolt in Manchester in 2009. Mennea, known in Italy as the (&quot;the Arrow of the South&quot;), then announced his retirement, allowing himself more time for his studies. However, he came back from retirement soon and won a bronze medal in the 200 m at the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki. A year later, he competed in his fourth consecutive Olympic 200 m final, becoming the first person to do so. The defending champion finished in seventh, and retired from athletics for a second time afterwards. Again, Mennea made a comeback, and competed in his fifth Olympics in Seoul, where he was the flag bearer: he qualified for the quarterfinals of the 200 m, but he decided to withdraw from the competition and did not take part into the next round.

Mennea admitted that he had used human growth hormone once during the last year of his career. In an interview to an Italian newspaper in 1987 he told that in 1984, during the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, an American physiotherapist proposed a doping treatment to him. Back in Italy he tried two injections of human growth hormone but the crisis of conscience he got was so important that it induced him to retire from activity: &quot;I realized that in my life I was looking for everything, except for that.&quot; Although the usage of the substance is banned in modern-day competition, it was not banned at the time by the IAAF.

===After athletics===
After his athletic career, Mennea worked as a lawyer and a sports agent. He was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004 elected on the list of The Democrats, but failed in his attempt to be re-elected. He also lobbied for independent doping testing.

===Death===
Mennea died on 21 March 2013, in a Rome hospital from pancreatic cancer. He was sixty years old. On the day of his death, the Italian Railways announced that the new superfast train Frecciarossa ETR 1000, entering service in 2014, would carry his name.

<text>Mirko Rački (13 October 1879 – 21 August 1982) was a Croatian painter.

Rački was born in Novi Marof, and graduated from the Teacher&#x27;s Academy in Zagreb. He then went to the private art school of Heinrich Strehblow in Vienna, then studied at the Academy in Prague under Vlaho Bukovac and in Vienna under W. Unger. He lived in Munich from 1907 to 1914, then in Rome, Geneva, Zagreb, and finally in Split.

His most productive period was when he lived outside Croatia, but he was in permanent contact with Croatian artists (Izidor Kršnjavi and Ivan Meštrović), and during those times he worked in the spirit of the Vienna Secession. In 1941 Rački was admitted into the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Rački&#x27;s most important collection of work is connected to Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; and he was occupied with these motifs until the end of his life.

Some his works were published in the collector&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; from 1934 in Bergamo. A retrospective exhibition was held in 1970 in Zagreb.

<text>Karosta is a former Russian Imperial and Soviet naval base on the Baltic Sea, which today is a neighbourhood in Liepāja, Latvia.

== History ==
The naval base was originally constructed in 1890-1906 for Tsar Alexander III of Russia, and named Порт Императора Александра III. Built on the bare coast it consisted of a large man-made harbour including a large breakwater and inland submarine base.

During Latvian independence after World War I, the base was called Kara osta (&quot;War Port&quot; in Latvian), later shortened to Karaosta and Karosta (Кароста in Russian).

It was a closed military area and army town during the Soviet period, serving as a base for the Soviet Baltic Fleet. It was inaccessible to the civilians of neighbouring Liepāja.

When the Soviet Union military left Latvia in 1994 after the restoration of Latvian independence, Karosta became largely uninhabited and most structures fell to ruin. In late 1990s, the area was troubled by high unemployment, street crime and drug problems. It is today a neighbourhood in the northern outskirts of Liepāja in Latvia, occupying a third of the area of the city.

== Today ==
Today, Karosta is a popular place for tourists and artists, who are attracted to its historical sights, such as the scenic seascapes with partially blasted fortresses on the Baltic shore. The K@2 Artists center was established in 2000 and acts as a frame for many cultural activities by local and foreign artists who come to Karosta for art projects and to get inspiration from Karosta’s nature, buildings, ruins, and people.

The army headquarters include czar-era mansions used by admirals, a palace for the czar (reportedly only used once), an impressive Russian Orthodox Naval Cathedral, as well as underground bunkers and abandoned storehouses. Soviet-era buildings include many rows of block housing. At its height Karosta was home to over 20,000 people.

Karosta military prison has now been converted into a museum (open May - September) and it is possible to spend the night in the guardhouse, processed as a prisoner would have been.

<doc id="675044" wikidata="Q1755178" url="?curid=675044" title="USS Florida (SSGN-728)">
<text>USS &quot;Florida&quot; (SSBN-728/SSGN-728), an cruise missile submarine, is the sixth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the U.S. state of Florida. She was commissioned with the hull designation of SSBN-728; with her conversion to a cruise missile submarine, from a ballistic missile submarine, she was re-designated SSGN-728.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build her was awarded to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation in Groton, Connecticut, on 28 February 1975 and her keel was laid down on the bicentennial of the United States independence, 4 July 1976. The boat was unnamed at the keel-laying ceremony.

The initial boat&#x27;s crew formed the precommissioning unit on 8 July 1980. The first duty watches were stationed on 14 February 1981 to support the operational control transfer of engineering systems to boat&#x27;s force control. The Secretary of the Navy finally named her on 19 January 1981.

&quot;Florida&quot; was launched on 14 November 1981 sponsored by Mrs. Marcia M. Carlucci, wife of then Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci. The reactor was initially taken critical on 13 November 1982; the boat went into service and the crew moved onboard on 21 January 1983. &quot;Florida&quot; commenced initial builders&#x27; sea trials on 21 February 1983 and was subsequently delivered to the Navy on 17 May 1983, 43 days ahead of schedule. She was commissioned on 18 June 1983, with Captain William L. Powell in command of the Blue Crew and Captain George R. Sterner in command of the Gold Crew.

==Operational history==
Both crews successfully completed the demonstration and shakedown operations, each culminated by the successful launch of a Trident C-4 missile. &quot;Florida&quot; transited the Panama Canal in February and arrived in Bangor, Washington on 25 March 1984. She completed her first strategic deterrent patrol on 25 July 1984.

As of November 2002, &quot;Florida&quot; had successfully completed 61 strategic deterrent patrols. She won the Battle E in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1999, and 2002. In 1991, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award. In 1997, &quot;Florida&quot;″s skipper, Commander Michael J. Alfonso, was relieved of command &quot;because he had been unable to foster an effective command team so necessary to the success of the U.S. submarine force.&quot;

&quot;Florida&quot;″s command history for 1997 states: 

===Conversion to SSGN===

&quot;Florida&quot; entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard in July 2003 to undergo a refueling and conversion from an SSBN to an SSGN. &quot;Florida&quot; completed her conversion in April 2006 and is homeported in Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia. On 25 May 2006 she had a return to service ceremony at Naval Station Mayport, Florida. Ms. Carlucci was the boat&#x27;s sponsor for her recommissioning in Mayport in May 2006.

===Operation Odyssey Dawn===
On 19 March 2011, in conjunction with other U.S. Navy and Royal Navy warships and submarines, &quot;Florida&quot; fired scores of Tomahawk missiles at Libyan air defense targets as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. The Tomahawk missile strikes allowed British, French, and allied warplanes to begin enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya, preventing Muammar Gaddafi from using his air force to attack rebels in his country. This was the first combat action for the &quot; Florida&quot; or any other &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarine. During Operation Odyssey Dawn, &quot;Florida&quot; launched 93 Tomahawk missiles, with 90 effective, out of her total magazine of about 160 missiles.

Of the four &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGNs in the U.S. Navy, &quot;Florida&quot; was the only one that was available for use in &quot;Operation Odyssey Dawn&quot; since she was the only one that had been assigned to cruise the Mediterranean Sea. Some other Tomahawk missiles were fired by American surface ships and by a few Royal Navy nuclear submarines.

On 28 June 2010, &quot;Florida&quot; was one of three &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines involved in a US response to Chinese missile testing in the contested East China Sea. &quot;Florida&quot;, , and all surfaced simultaneously in the waters of the British Indian Ocean Territory, the Philippines, and the Republic of Korea respectively.

===2023===
&quot;Florida&quot; was sent to the Persian Gulf in autumn 2023, during the Israel-Hamas war. Earlier that year in April, the Navy reported that &quot;Florida&quot; was one of two &quot;Ohio&quot;-class SSGNs, cruising through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea, while operating in the Middle East.

==Awards==
On 15 February 2013, &quot;Florida&quot;″s crew was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation having &quot;distinguished itself in action against the enemy&quot; during Operation Odyssey Dawn in 2011.

<doc id="675049" wikidata="Q721259" url="?curid=675049" title="Thomas Scott (Orangeman)">
<text>Thomas Scott (1 January 1842 – 4 March 1870) was an Irish Protestant who emigrated to Canada in 1863. While working as a labourer on the &quot;Dawson Road Project&quot;, he moved on to Winnipeg where he met John Christian Schultz and fell under the influence of the Canadian Party. His political involvement in the Red River Settlement from then on led to his capture at Fort Garry where he was held hostage with others. On 4 March 1870 Scott was marched out of Fort Garry&#x27;s east gate and was executed on the wall by the provisional government of the Red River Settlement led by Louis Riel.

Scott&#x27;s execution led to the Wolseley Expedition – a military force said to be sent to protect Canada from American annexation, but widely believed to confront Riel and the Métis at the Red River Settlement, authorized by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald. Scott&#x27;s execution highlights a time of severe conflict between settlers and the Métis in Canadian history. His execution led to the exile of Riel and to Riel&#x27;s own execution for treason in 1885.

== Life ==

Little is known of Scott&#x27;s early years. He was born in the Clandeboye area of County Down, in what is today Northern Ireland in 1842. Raised as a Presbyterian, he became an active Orangeman. Scott emigrated to Ontario in 1863. On his arrival at Red River, he worked as a labourer on the &quot;Dawson Road&quot; project, connecting the Red River and Lake Superior. He took part in a strike in 1869, for which he was fired and convicted of aggravated assault. Scott then moved to Winnipeg, where he met John Christian Schultz and became a supporter of the Canadian Party. Scott backed the annexation of the Red River Settlement to Canada, and the rest of his life revolved around this conflict.

== Role in the Red River Rebellion ==

During the Red River Rebellion, Scott was first arrested and imprisoned in December 1869 at Upper Fort Garry by Louis Riel and his men along with the party of 45 who had fortified themselves in Schultz&#x27;s store and warehouse in a challenge to the authority of The National Committee of the Metis of the Red River led by Louis Riel. Thomas Scott escaped Upper Fort Garry in January 1870, as did John Christian Schultz and Charles Mair. In February, Scott alongside several hundred armed volunteers amassed at Kildonan Presbyterian Church and school planning to attack Upper Fort Garry to release the prisoners still being held there. Summarily, Riel released the prisoners, and the rescue party was dispersed. Scott and several volunteers marched to Portage la Prairie but passed too close to Fort Garry, where Scott was captured and imprisoned by Riel&#x27;s garrison once again. Mair and Schultz travelled through the United States to Ontario to urge the government for an extensive military expedition to the Red River Settlement.

Scott suffered severe diarrhea during his second incarceration, which had a negative effect on both Scott and his captors. During his captivity, Scott was extraordinarily difficult, opinionated, and verbally abusive and refused to acknowledge his captors&#x27; legal authority. Thomas had an altercation with a group of guards that injured him so severely that Riel had him locked into another cell with a stronger lock, partly for his own safety. Scott&#x27;s fellow prisoners had asked that he be removed due to his obnoxious behaviour while in captivity. He was eventually tried and executed for committing insubordination.

== Trial and execution ==

While in jail, Scott became a nuisance as he caused trouble with the guards and made attempts at escaping. 
He was then brought in front of a court where they found him guilty of defying the authority of the Provisional Government, fighting with guards, and slandering the name of Louis Riel.
One of the issues in determining the character of Thomas Scott is a lack of unbiased evidence. An example would be his trial which was held in-camera by a small number of Métis and without any outside observers. An eye-witness to this trial, Nolin, testified later that Scott was not present for the accusations of the charges against him nor for any evidence to support these accusations. These accusations plus their evidence (coming partially from Louis Riel) were later summarised in English by Riel and presented to Scott. Louis Riel himself described the behaviour of Scott that led to his execution not once but multiple times over many years. However, the charges against Scott that were put forth by his contemporaries in 1870 were not the same as those allegations levelled against Scott in later years by Riel and then by others. In other words, as the years progressed, the accusations became more and more detailed and Scott became a more villainous character. Some of these elaborations entered the oral tradition of the Metis.
Scott was not alone in being sentenced to death, but the other sentences were never carried out. On 4 March 1870, unlike the other members of his group, he faced the firing squad. His execution was watched by 100 bystanders. Many eyewitnesses disagree on multiple aspects of Scott&#x27;s execution from disagreement on his last words and actions to the manner of his death. What is agreed upon is that he was shot while blindfolded by a firing squad against the east side gate of Upper Fort Garry. It was reported that Scott was kneeling in the snow praying fervently up until he was shot. Other witnesses reported that he had been yelling wildly that his execution was unjust and that his execution was murder. The weapons that were used by the firing squad were ordinary hunting weapons (supposedly muskets) and it was observed that the men who shot these guns were intoxicated. At the time of fire, the men in the firing squad stood 60 metres away from Scott. It was also debated whether or not Scott died immediately when shot by the firing squad.

Métis leader John Bruce claimed that only two bullets from the firing squad actually hit Scott, wounding him once in the left shoulder, and once in the upper chest. A man came forward and discharged his pistol close to Scott&#x27;s head, but the bullet only penetrated the upper part of the left cheek and came out somewhere near the cartilage of the nose. Still not dead, Scott was placed in a makeshift coffin, from which he was later reported to cry:
:&quot;For God&#x27;s sake take me out of here or kill me.&quot;
John Bruce said that he was left there to die of his injuries.

A similar account was reported by Reverend George Young, who was told by Major George Robinson that Scott was confined to a roughly made coffin on the presumption that he had died when shot on by the firing squad. Robinson said that five hours later he and Riel entered the room where Scott&#x27;s coffin was being kept and heard Scott beg for death. Robinson fled the room, Riel closed the door and, a few moments later, Robinson heard a shot and presumed that Scott was then dead. This account was cast into suspicion, though, as Riel had fired Robinson as the editor of &quot;New Nation&quot; on 19 March 1870, so it remains unclear whether or not these accounts are based in fact or acted to defame Riel in retaliation for Robinson&#x27;s dismissal.

Upon Scott&#x27;s death, George Young forwarded Thomas Scott&#x27;s documents to his brother Hugh. These documents included Scott&#x27;s commendatory letters and certificates of good character written by Presbyterian minister of whose church Scott had been connected to in Ireland. Additionally his life savings were sent to his brother. It has been suspected that because it was a such substantial amount ($103.50), that this money might have indicated an immoral lifestyle.

Despite all claims regarding the death of Thomas Scott, many observers and testimonies differ in the conditions that Scott had died - details such as whether or not he wore a blindfold, if Riel was present during the execution, and if Scott had actually survived first being shot. With all these details differing and no concrete evidence available that suggests an accurate depiction of the events, there is much to wonder about the legitimacy of Thomas Scott&#x27;s death and the resulting impacts that shaped Manitoba. In summary, the events that indirectly built Manitoba are interpretations and cannot be proven.

It is not known where Scott&#x27;s body was laid to rest. In 1870, the supposed burial site of Thomas Scott was revisited by a party of men led by Young. The purpose of this expedition was to bring his body back to Ontario. The party found the reported site of his burial just outside the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company store, dug down. There they discovered the fruit tree box that was meant to be Scott&#x27;s coffin. The box was discovered partially open and measuring in length. No body was found once the box was opened. The box contained only dirt and shavings of some sort. The length of the box has thrown into question whether Scott had ever been buried at that site. He was tall and would not have fit into this makeshift coffin which had been said to have been nailed shut. Later, John Bruce claimed that Elzéar Goulet, one of Riel&#x27;s men who had allegedly disposed of the body, had told him that a week after Scott&#x27;s execution a hole had been cut in the ice of German Creek about a quarter of a mile from the mouth of the River La Seine. Scott&#x27;s body was brought to this site and tied in heavy chains and then sunk into the water. Another theory is that his body was taken out of the coffin by a Fenian Winnipegger, the proprietor of the Red Saloon, under whose floor it was buried. Years later, when the site of the business was torn up for road construction, a skeleton was found. Some suggest that the skeleton belonged to Thomas Scott.

== Significance of his death ==

While relatively unknown during his lifetime, once news of Scott&#x27;s death made it to Ontario he was regarded as a martyr by the English-speaking, Protestant population. At the time, the term &quot;Orangeman&quot; could refer to a Protestant Ulsterman who belonged the Orange Order (established in 1795 to defend the British sovereign and the Protestant religion), or was anti-Catholic. Many Orange Orders claimed Scott, but there is no evidence that he ever claimed the Orange Order. Despite the massive reaction of the Canada First movement, there is no evidence, even in the Metis-inspired versions, of Scott harbouring anti-Catholic sentiment. With opinions divided along ethnic lines during the century following Scott&#x27;s death, English-speaking historians have depicted the execution of Thomas Scott as the murder of an innocent victim despite Scott&#x27;s involvement in the death of Norbert Parisien and his reputation for violence. His execution was used to explain Louis Riel&#x27;s fall from federally recognized politics. It was held that Riel could not be dealt with legitimately because Ontario considered him a murderer. Additionally, the marginalization of Métis peoples in Canada was justified by the Anglo-Canadians&#x27; memory of a brutal murder dealt to one of their own.

In contrast, French Canadians and sympathizers have emphasized Scott&#x27;s problematic behaviour. Historian Lyle Dick said that Scott&#x27;s martyrdom created a &quot;rallying symbol&quot; for expansionists who wanted the armed force be sent to the Northwest. This fostered higher recruitment rates for the Red River Expedition and hastened its dispatch. Upon learning about Scott&#x27;s death, the Canadian government dispatched the Wolseley Expedition to Fort Garry from Ontario to seize the fort and force Louis Riel, now branded a murderer, to flee the settlement. Scott&#x27;s religious affiliation to the Orange Order had repercussions in Ontario as well. The Toronto &quot;Globe&quot; had published an article that stated Scott was cruelly murdered by the enemies of the Queen, country and religion.

Some sources say Scott&#x27;s execution turned the Red River Settlement against the leadership of Louis Riel. On 14 April 1870, Macdonald had written to the Earl of Carnarvon that Thomas Scott&#x27;s men were calling for retribution against Riel for the unjust murder of Scott. The Scott incident also complicated negotiations with the provisional Red River government and Ontario. The &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; passed shortly after Scott&#x27;s death, creating the province of Manitoba.

== Memorials and portrayals of Scott in Canada ==

The Thomas Scott Memorial Orange Hall was constructed in 1902 and stood on Princess Street in Winnipeg until its demolition in 2020. The hall was named in commemoration of Scott.
Thomas Scott and his execution is portrayed in sources by many historians controversially. As mentioned, there is plenty of speculation of his behavior in prison, the event of his execution and the way in which he died and was laid to rest. In Louis Riel (comics), Chester Brown portrays Scott as a nuisance. According to Brown, Scott was aggravating, insulting, and rude while imprisoned in Fort Garry. These qualities are supposedly what may have led to his execution. In the George Bloomfield directed movie, Riel (film), Thomas Scott&#x27;s trial and execution is briefly portrayed. He is depicted as loud and uses offensive words such as &quot;savage.&quot; He is only depicted in this way however, after he is convicted and led to his execution.

Bumsted, a specialist on the topic of the Red River Rebellion, also discusses many popular portrayals of Thomas Scott in his work, &quot;Thomas Scott&#x27;s Body: And Other Essays on Early Manitoba History.&quot; It is important to note that even Bumsted stresses that many stories may have been elaborated on. According to Bumsted, Louis Riel explains Scott&#x27;s execution for two reasons. First, Scott&#x27;s negative behavior and actions while in prison, as described by many other historians. Second, Scott is portrayed simply as a pawn being played in a bigger political game. Historians who expand on the behavioral issues claim that both the guards and other captors were aggravated by Scott&#x27;s words and actions. He is said to have been threatening towards Riel and the guards and used constant obscene language. It is argued in some works that these behaviors are typical of captives who believe they are held unjustly, which Scott certainty believed. Also mentioned earlier, Scott is reported to have suffered diarrhea. It is commonly said by historians that this would have caused him aggravation, resulting in his negative behavior. The diarrhea combined with the annoying behavior however, is argued to have been reason to execute Scott as he was too much to deal with. Bumsted also discusses Scott&#x27;s portrayal as a &quot;ringleader&quot; in a labour strike against Dawson Road superintendent John Snow, leading to justification for execution. Scott is also portrayed as a heavy drinker and a &quot;barroom brawler.&quot; Contradictory, Scott is also portrayed in some works as being quiet and inoffensive, just powerful and determined. His execution in these stories is portrayed as being a factor of a personal animosity between him and Riel. This animosity is depicted in many different versions ranging from Scott offending Riel by telling him to move out of his way on the street, to a rivalry over love for the same women. This version has Scott rescuing a Metisse named Marie from a flood. Scott subsequently protected Marie from Riel and his &quot;clumsy&quot; courtship of her. This led to a hatred of Scott by Riel, causing him to want him executed.

According to Bumsted, the only thing commonly agreed throughout these depictions is that Scott&#x27;s execution was a political mistake by Louis Riel and the Métis.

<text>The State University System of Florida (SUSF or SUS) is a system of twelve public universities in the U.S. state of Florida. As of 2018, over 341,000 students were enrolled in Florida&#x27;s state universities. Together with the Florida College System, which includes Florida&#x27;s 28 community colleges and state colleges, it is part of Florida&#x27;s system of public higher education. The system, headquartered in Tallahassee, is overseen by a chancellor and governed by the Florida Board of Governors.

The Florida Board of Governors was created in 2003 to centralize the administration of the State University System of Florida. Previously, Florida&#x27;s State University System had been governed by the Florida Board of Regents (1965–2001) and the Florida Board of Control (1905–1965).

==History and governance==
Prior to 1905, Florida&#x27;s state institutions were governed by a Board of Education and even earlier variations thereof, reaching back to the Florida Constitution of 1838 wherein higher education and normal education was established, based on grants of land from the U.S. Congress. From 1905 to 1965, the few universities in the system were governed by the Florida Board of Control. The Board of Control was replaced by the Florida Board of Regents in 1965, to accommodate the growing university system.

The Board of Regents governed until it was disbanded by the Florida Legislature in 2001, and its authority was divided between the Florida Board of Education (which was given some authority over all levels of public education in the state), and appointed university boards of trustees, which operated independently for each separate institution. In 2002, Floridians led by U.S. senator Bob Graham passed an amendment to the Florida Constitution establishing a new statewide governing body, the Florida Board of Governors.

<text>Reviers () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region, in northwestern France. It lies 4 km south of Courseulles-sur-Mer and 15 kn northwest of Caen. It lies at the confluence of the rivers Seulles and Mue. There is bridge west of Reviers, crossing the Seulles, on the principal road (D176) connecting to Colombiers-sur-Seulles, and a bridge in Reviers, crossing the Mue, on the principal road (D35), connecting east to Tailleville.

==History: D-Day==
Reviers was the object of one tactical engagement, on D-Day, it to secure the bridge over La Mue. Additionally, in securing the village, the headquarters of two German units, of 716 Infantrie-Division, that caused much havoc with the Canadians on D-Day, were taken. The Regina Rifle Regiment (7 CIB Assault), landing its second wave on NAN Green at 08h55, saw &#x27;D&#x27; Company, (OC Major J.V. Love - KIA 06.06.44) after fighting through town, reduced to forty-nine men, re-organized and set out to Reviers, at 09h30, tasked to seize the bridge over the Mue River.

In making an exit east of Courseulles-sur-Mer, bypassing the fight for WN30, the Canadians first encountered remnants of a platoon (Züg) of Kompanie 2. /Pz.Jg-Abt 716., with three 7.5 cm Pak 40, in an open field emplacement, on Les Champs des Fers, it much weakened by the Naval Beach Drenching Fire Programme. Driving south, Kompanie 2./ Ost-Bataillon 441., positioned southeast of Courseulles-sur-Mer, at Les Rotys, attempted to block their movement. Much weakened, also by the Naval Beach Drenching Fire Programme, elements of the Kompanie 2, had &#x27;left&#x27; their positions, ordered to join Kompanie 8. / II 736., at Les Ruines St Ursin, east of Reviers.

&#x27;D&#x27; Company, The Regina Rifle Regiment, now approaching from the North, down The D170, arrived in Reviers at 11h00 and the ‘bridge was reported clear at 12h15&#x27;, without damage to the village. With &#x27;C&#x27; Company and Battalion Headquarters (The Regina Rifle Regiment) arriving at 15h00, reorganized, it and the battalion moved south, remaining West of la Mue. At 19h00, coming up from Courseulles, ‘A’ Company was ordered to remain in Reviers to guard the approaches to the town and the bridge.

Needing to be close to their District Sector Defence Commander, KVU-Gr. Seulles - Kdr Hauptmann Deptolla (Kdr Bataillon II. / 736.) Gefechtsstand: Château de Tailleville at WN 23, in Reviers, east of the Seulles, were located two German headquarters.

* Gefechtsstand Stab: Northeast of Reviers - GHQ Heeres-schwere-Artillerie-Abteilung 989. (Heeresgruppe-Reserve, Attached to 716 Inf-Div) having command over three batteries, deployed Southwest of Basly (Moved to Bénouville), at Amblie (East of The Seulles), and its third East of Creully.
* Gefechtsstand Stab: Kompanie 2. (StuG) / Panzerjäger-Abtielung 716., having command over three platoons (Zug) deployed at Graye-sur-Mer: Hameau de la Valette, Courseulles-sur-Mer: Champs des Fers, and Berniers-sur-Mer: Les Perruques. Kompanie 2./ Panzerjäger-Abteilung 716., was ordered established on 25 Dec 43, to consist of three platoons (Zug): x2 with three 7.5 cm ATk guns each, and x1 with two 8.8 cm ATk guns. to be deployed consistent with the Division Commanders direction.

Note 1. The Bridge over la Seulles (depicted on maps as: Pont de Reviers) was secured by 1st Bn - The Canadian Scottish Regiment on 06.06.1944, without damage.

<doc id="675082" wikidata="Q661092" url="?curid=675082" title="Russell Cave National Monument">
<text>Russell Cave National Monument is a U.S. national monument in northeastern Alabama, United States, close to the city of Bridgeport. The monument was established on May 11, 1961, when 310 acres (1.3 km2) of land were donated by the National Geographic Society to the American people. It is now administered and maintained by the National Park Service. The national monument was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966.

Russell Cave has an exceptionally large main entrance, which was used for thousands of years as a shelter by cultures of prehistoric Indians, from around 6500 BCE, the period of earliest-known human settlement in the southeastern United States, to 1650 CE and the period of European colonization. It is believed to have primarily served as a seasonal winter shelter. The people relied on the surrounding forest to gather produce and hunt for game and fish, stone and game for tools, and wood fuel for fires. Guided tours of the shelter area are available.

With a mapped length of 7.2 miles (11.6 km), Russell Cave is the third-longest mapped cave in Alabama. It is ranked 90th on the United States Long Cave List, and is listed as number 314 on the World Long Cave List. Caving is no longer allowed inside the cave. The grounds offer trails for walking, and the area is a station on the North Alabama Birding Trail.

==Geology==
The rock from which Russell Cave was carved was formed over 300 million years ago at the bottom of an inland sea covering the region. Due to continental drift, the area that is now northeast Alabama was located very close to the Equator at the time this limestone was forming. This area is now located in a temperate climate, but 300 million years ago, it was a shallow, tropical sea. Carbonaceous deposits of skeletons and shells were slowly transformed into limestone. Rainwater, mildly acidic from atmospheric carbon dioxide, slowly dissolved a portion of the limestone rock, resulting in the formation of the cave. About 9,000 to 12,000 years ago, the collapse of a cavern roof beneath a hillside near Doran&#x27;s Cove created a sinkhole and exposed Russell Cave.

Until shortly before the first occupation by Native Americans, the cavern was uninhabitable due to the large stream that occupied the entirety of the cavern. A rockfall from the cavern roof diverted the stream to one side, however, exposing a portion of the cave floor. The first occupants lived on this irregular floor of rock slabs. Debris from occupants and deposits falling from the ceiling slowly raised the floor. The floor ultimately was raised an additional 7–8 ft (2.0 to 2.5 m) and up to 30 ft (9.0 m) near the upper entrance. In the 1960s, after the cave had been excavated, the United States Bureau of Mines installed 15-ft-long (4.5 m) bolts as supports to prevent additional collapses of limestone rock.

The cave mouth faces to the east, preventing the ingress of cold north and northwest winds and allowing in the morning sun. According to a published cave map, the cave has five entrances in addition to the main entrance. Three of the entrances are referred to as canoe entrances, while the other two are named the picnic and pig entrances.

A natural spring flows into the cave and travels underground for 1.5 mi (2.5 km) before joining Widow&#x27;s Creek, and ultimately the Tennessee River.

==History==

===Archaic period (before 1000 BCE)===
Pieces of the history of thousands of years of prehistoric humans have been revealed at this archeological site. Chipped flint points and charcoal from campfires provide evidence that occupation of Russell Cave began nearly 10,000 years ago by Native Americans in the southeastern Archaic period. The charcoal remains of the first fires in the cavern date to between 6550 and 6145 BCE, based on radiocarbon dating. As the people were hunter-gatherers, they likely occupied the cave only during the autumn and winter seasons, when they needed more shelter. According to John Griffin, the issue of seasonality (during what season or seasons the cave was used) remains to be determined. Evidence indicating occupation in autumn and winter include deer bones and passenger pigeon remains. The presence of shellfish artifacts clouds the determination somewhat, as shellfish would have been easier to procure during periods of dry weather in midspring and late summer. However, William J. Clench has suggested that the occupants may have brought mussels and snails to store in nearby bodies of water (Dry Creek and/or Crownover Springs) for use as needed including in autumn or winter. Based on the existing information, Griffin is &quot;strongly inclined&quot; to view Russell Cave as a place of winter occupancy.

In addition to serving as a shelter (presumably for several related families totaling 15 to 30 individuals), the cave would have provided a constant source of water as temperatures in the protected area remained above freezing. The cave&#x27;s occupancy was limited by individuals&#x27; need for mobility and by how much the land could support the people. The surrounding hardwood forest and nearby Tennessee River served as sources of food throughout the year. The food sources would have included aquatic animals (fish, turtles, shellfish), birds (including wild turkey), and small mammals (squirrels, raccoons, rabbits, gray foxes, skunks, bobcats, porcupines, and peccaries) taken in hunting. The women would gather and process a variety of nuts (including acorns), seeds, and roots. Larger animals such as deer and black bears were also commonly hunted by the men when the seasons permitted. Griffin has stated that the dominant animal food sources for these occupants were deer and turkey.

As gatherers, these occupants also would have consumed fruits and berries, although these plant foods may have been scarce or unavailable during the seasons of cave occupancy. Generally speaking, hunter-gathers relied more heavily on plant foods than they did animals. Indirect evidence of gathering includes pits for storage of nuts and seeds, mortars and pestles for breaking up shells and grinding nuts, and nut stones.

Goosefoot, genus&quot; Chenopodium&quot;, is a small flowering plant with edible seeds that may have been cultivated in small gardens. The evidence for this is uncertain, however. Related uncertainty exists in the timeframe for such cultivation (believed to be during Archaic or Woodland periods).

These early cave dwellers were efficient consumers of game. The women roasted or stewed the flesh. They cured and softened the hides or skins, and made pieces into clothing. Bones were shaped into tools.

The chief weapon of these occupants was a short spear (tipped with a stone point), which was propelled by an atlatl (throwing stick). The points were chipped from chert, which occurs as nodules and veins in limestone near the cave.

Chert was also used to fashion knives and scrapers. The people made awls and needles from the bones. They were used in the production of clothing from hides or manufacturing of baskets. Small pieces of bone were also used to make fish hooks. No ornamental works have been found in this layer of deposits.

Other items, such as baskets and articles fashioned from wood, and hides, were probably produced, but have not been preserved by the soil.

===Woodland period (1000 BCE to 500 CE)===
Around 1000 BCE, the implements of the Native Americans occupying Russell Cave underwent a dramatic change. Pottery appears for the first time. Smaller weapon points indicate that the bow and arrow had replaced the atlatl and spear. Tools fashioned from bone were more refined. Other domestic implements provide the first evidence of gardening at the site. Additionally, bone and shell appear in ornamental artifacts. Evident throughout the Woodland period is an increase in the amount of hunting at the expense of other activities. During this period, the cave clearly had become simply a hunting camp. In the seasons away from the cave, the natives probably joined other groups at summer villages larger than those of the Archaic period.

These changes occurred in groups throughout the Eastern United States and marked the beginning of the Woodland period. During this period, the people built earthwork burial mounds, the population increased, and trade became important.

Changes in the shape and style of artifacts at Russell Cave during the Woodland period serve as a basis for identifying cultural subdivisions within the period. For example, early pottery of the period is decorated with fabric impressions, while later pottery is decorated with impressions made by carved wooden paddles.

===Mississippian period (after 500 CE)===
After the close of the Woodland period (around 500 CE), Native Americans made less and less use of Russell Cave. Occasionally, small parties of hunters left objects distinct from those of the Woodland-period occupants. These visitors (known as mound builders of the Mississippian culture) came from permanent villages. These had successfully developed agriculture on the rich river bottomlands of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and their tributaries. They build large complexes of earthwork mounds to express their religious and political concepts. The last occupants of the cave departed around 1000 CE.

===Historic period===
Centuries later, Cherokee Indians occupied this part of the Tennessee Valley. They and the subsequent European settlers made little use of the cave. Due to the establishment of permanent settlements, locations such as Russell Cave were used only sporadically by Native Americans, usually as stopovers for hunting and trading parties. Few objects that they left were found very close to the surface. The only modern historical artifact found at the site was a metal fish hook.

The expedition of Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto passed within 100 mi (160 km) of Russell Cave in 1540.

===Recent history===
Russell Cave was named after Colonel Thomas Russell, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War from North Carolina, who owned the property at the time when maps of the area were drawn. The surrounding land, called Doran&#x27;s Cove, is named after Major James Doran, Russell&#x27;s brother-in-law and the original owner of the land. Following excavation and reporting in 1956, the land was purchased by the National Geographic Society and donated to the American people. The area was designated as a national monument in 1961 during the presidency of John F. Kennedy.

Russell Cave provides the most thorough artifact records of any prehistoric culture in the southeast. Archeological field surveys have uncovered evidence of the cave&#x27;s occupants. Around two tons of artifacts have been recovered from the site. These discoveries include charcoal from fires, bones of animals (as remains of hunted game and as bone tools), spear and arrow points, sherds of pottery, and the remains of several adults and children buried at the site. The bodies, ranging in age from infant to 50 years, were buried in shallow pits in the cave floor and were not accompanied by artifacts.

The first relics were discovered in 1953 when four members from the Tennessee Archeological Society and University of Chattanooga began digging in the cave. This first excavation reached a depth of 6 ft (1.8 m).

Upon realizing the extent and importance of the site, they contacted the Smithsonian Institution, which conducted three seasons (1956–1958) of archeological digs in cooperation with the National Geographic Society. They reached a depth of more than 32 ft (9.8 m). An additional excavation was performed in 1962 by the National Park Service to a depth of 10.5 ft (3.2 m). This final excavation completed the archeological record and established an on-site exhibit.

Analysis of the distribution of the artifacts among functional categories (fabricating and processing tools, domestic implements, weapons) using an experimental technique proposed by Howard Winters reveals that the ratio of nonweapon artifacts to weapons was very low. This is indicative of a hunting camp with lack of permanent occupancy. The picture of prehistoric life gained from Russell Cave is necessarily incomplete, due to the incomplete nature of archeological records and because Russell Cave represents only a portion of the annual lifecycle of the inhabitants.

==Biology==
Studies of historical geology and paleobotany have shown that the flora and fauna of the Eastern Forest Region remained essentially unchanged for thousands of years. This began to change after the arrival of European-American settlers in the early 19th century. They removed trees for timber and to open land for subsistence and commercial farming.

The cave is populated by both the brown bat and northern long-eared bat. The cave stream contains fish known as sculpin. Snakes of the surrounding area include the copperhead, timber rattlesnake, rat snake, and kingsnake. Over 115 species of birds have been identified by researchers at Russell Cave, which is located along the North Alabama Birding Trail. Although the site is now south of the southern boundary of the porcupine range, their bones have been found in digs at the earliest occupational levels. The peccary, also hunted by former occupants, is no longer found in this region.

==Visitation==
Russell Cave National Monument is located at 3729 County Road 98, Bridgeport, Alabama 35740. The site is open year-round, seven days a week (closed on New Year&#x27;s Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day). Hours of operation are 8:00 am to 4:30 pm Central Time. No fees are charged to enter the park or tour the cave.

A diverse range of attractions is available to visitors of Russell Cave National Monument.

===Gilbert H. Grosvenor Visitor Center===
In the center, guests can view museum exhibits, watch documentary films about the lifestyles of prehistoric peoples, or purchase items from the gift shop or bookstore.

The visitor center at Russell Cave National Monument is named after Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor, the editor of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; from 1903 to 1954, and president of the National Geographic Society from 1920 to 1954. The visitor center was dedicated in 1967.

===Cave shelter===
Guided tours of the cave shelter are conducted by National Park Service Interpretative Rangers. The cave shelter includes the areas that were occupied by the prehistoric groups and features a diorama depicting activities of the occupants. The cave shelter is located about 300 yd (310 m) from the visitor center. It is accessed via by an elevated wooden boardwalk.

===Russell Cave===
Russell Cave is one of the most extensive cave systems in Alabama, with more than 7 mi (11 km) of mapped passageways. Due to the discovery of several rare species (including a species of scorpion that exists nowhere else in the world), recreational caving is no longer allowed.

===Walking trails===
Russell Cave National Monument offers visitors two trails: the Nature Trail, a 0.6-mile (.95 km) paved trail, and the Backcountry Trail, a 1.2-mile (1.9-km) dirt trail. Both trails provide good opportunities to observe the forest, wildflowers, and Montague Mountain. Points along the trails feature plants that were used by Native Americans for food, tools, and other daily necessities.

===Native American Festival===
Each year during the first weekend in May, the Russell Cave National Monument hosts a Native American Festival, which includes performances of storytelling, dancing, and Native American flute playing. A historical reenactment of a Cherokee encampment is conducted. At this event and at other times throughout the year, demonstrations of Native American lifestyles and weaponry are conducted. Weapons demonstrations include flintknapping to produce points (arrowheads), use of the atlatl for spear throwing, and use of a bow and arrow. Other demonstrations feature wood carving, handbuilding of pottery, and fire building.

===North Alabama Birding Trail===
Russell Cave National Monument is Site 44 on the Northeastern Loop of the North Alabama Birding Trail. The North Alabama Birding Trail is not a &quot;trail&quot; in the traditional sense of the word, but a series of mostly roadside stops throughout North Alabama that have been selected for their birdwatching characteristics.

Although many types of birds are present, this site is known for its tanagers (summer tanager and scarlet tanager) and the yellow-billed cuckoo. During migration, almost any species of eastern warbler and vireo can be spotted in the park. The prime seasons for watching the songbirds are spring, summer, and autumn.

<text>The Institute of Heraldry, officially The Institute of Heraldry, Department of the Army, is an activity of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army solely responsible for furnishing heraldic services to the President of the United States and all federal government agencies. Title 18 of the United States Code, Chapter 33, Section 704 and Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 507 permit the institute to issue directives on how military insignia are displayed, the criteria for issuance, and how insignia will be worn on military uniforms.

The activities of The Institute of Heraldry encompass research, design, development, standardization, quality control, and other services relating to official symbolic items—seals, decorations, medals, insignia, badges, flags, and other items awarded to or authorized for official wear or display by federal government personnel and agencies. Limited research and information services concerning official symbolic items are also provided to the general public. The Institute of Heraldry is located at 9325 Gunston Road, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, a military installation in the U.S. Army Military District of Washington. The institute employs 22 Department of the Army civilians.

== History ==
=== Heraldic Program Office (1919–1960) ===
Heraldic and other military symbols have been used by the U.S. Armed Forces and federal government agencies since the beginning of the American Revolution. However, there was no coordinated military heraldry program until 1919, when an office within the War Department General Staff was established to approve and coordinate coats of arms and insignia of army organizations. In 1924, formal staff responsibility for specific military designs was delegated to the Quartermaster General of the Army. As the needs for symbolism by the military services and the federal government expanded, the scope of the services furnished by the Quartermaster General evolved into the Heraldic Program Office. The expansion of the army during World War II, and the subsequent increased interest in symbolism, contributed to the growth of the Heraldic Program Office. It was further expanded by , approved September 1957, , which delineated the authority of the Secretary of the Army to furnish heraldic services to military departments and other branches of the federal government.

=== The Institute of Heraldry (1960–present) ===

Department of the Army General Order No. 29, dated 10 August 1960, placed The Institute of Heraldry under the control of the Quartermaster General of the Army, effective 1 September 1960. The Adjutant General assumed responsibility of the institute in 1962, when the Office of the Quartermaster General ceased to exist because the Army reorganized. In 1987, another realignment subordinated the institute to the U.S. Total Army Personnel Command (present-day U.S. Army Human Resources Command). In April 1994, The institute moved from Cameron Station to Fort Belvoir, Virginia. In October 2004, another realignment assigned responsibility for the institute to the Office of the Administrative Assistant to the Secretary of the Army, Headquarters, Department of the Army.

<text>Rocquencourt () is a former commune in the Yvelines department in the Île-de-France in north-central France. On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune Le Chesnay-Rocquencourt. It is about north-west of Versailles and west of center Paris.

The commune is mainly known as the location of a research unit of INRIA (in the Domaine de Voluceau, formerly Camp Voluceau, used by SHAPE) as well as a freeway exchange known as the Rocquencourt Triangle (&quot;triangle de Rocquencourt&quot;, junction of the A12 autoroute and the A13 autoroute), which is often mentioned in traffic news.

==History==
On 1 July 1815, Napoleon&#x27;s Grande Armée fought its last battle in Rocquencourt and Le Chesnay. After the defeat of Waterloo on 18 June 1815, Grouchy&#x27;s army withdrew to Paris via Namur and Dinant, reaching Paris on 29 June, a few days before the Prussians, who camped at Versailles.

While negotiating the final armistice, Exelmans was ordered to attack the Prussians at Versailles on 1 July 1815. Under attack the Prussians retreated from Versailles and headed east, but were blocked by the French at Vélizy. They failed to re-enter Versailles and headed for Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Their first squadron came under fire at the entrance of Rocquencourt and attempted to escape through the fields. They were forced into a small, narrow street in Le Chesnay and killed or captured. However, the main body of the Prussian army succeeded in reaching Saint-Germain. (From Presentation of Rocquencourt.)

<doc id="675126" wikidata="Q150880" url="?curid=675126" title="DFB-Pokal">
<text>The DFB-Pokal (), also known as the German Cup in English, is a German knockout football cup competition held annually by the German Football Association (DFB). Sixty-four teams participate in the competition, including all clubs from the Bundesliga and the 2. Bundesliga along with the four best teams from the 3. Liga. It is considered the second-most important club title in German football after the Bundesliga championship. Taking place from August until May, the winner qualifies for the DFL-Supercup and the UEFA Europa League unless the winner already qualifies for the UEFA Champions League in the Bundesliga.

The competition was founded in 1935, then called the &quot;Tschammer-Pokal&quot;. The first titleholders were 1. FC Nürnberg. In 1937, Schalke 04 were the first team to win the double. The Tschammer-Pokal was suspended in 1944 due to World War II and disbanded following the demise of Nazi Germany. In 1952–53, the cup was reinstated in West Germany as the &quot;DFB-Pokal&quot;, named after the DFB, and was won by Rot-Weiss Essen. (FDGB-Pokal, the East German equivalent, started in 1949 and operated through the 1991 season, when it merged with the DFB-Pokal).

Bayern Munich have won a record 20 titles. The current holders are Bayer Leverkusen, who beat 1. FC Kaiserslautern 1–0 in the 2024 final to win their second title. Fortuna Düsseldorf hold the record for most consecutive tournament game wins (18) between 1978 and 1981, winning the cup in 1979 and 1980.

==Format==

The competition format has varied considerably since the inception of the &quot;Tschammer-Pokal&quot; in 1935.

===Participation===
The DFB-Pokal begins with a round of 64 teams. The 36 teams of the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, along with the top four finishers of the 3. Liga are automatically qualified for the tournament. Of the remaining slots, 21 are given to the cup winners of the regional football associations, the &quot;Verbandspokale&quot;. The three remaining slots are given to the three regional associations with the most men&#x27;s teams. They may assign the slot as they see fit but usually give it to the runner-up in the association cup. 

As every team taking part in the German football league system is entitled to participate in local tournaments which qualify for the association cups, every team can, in principle, compete in the DFB-Pokal. The only exception is that reserve teams (e.g. Bayern Munich II) are ineligible to enter.

===Seeding===
For the first round, the 64 teams are split into two pots of 32. One pot contains the 18 teams from the previous season of the Bundesliga and the top 14 teams from the previous season of the 2. Bundesliga. The other pot contains the bottom 4 teams from the previous season of the 2. Bundesliga, the top 4 teams from the previous season of the 3. Liga, and the 24 amateur teams that qualified through regional football tournaments. Teams from one pot are drawn against teams from the other pot. Since 1982, teams from the pot containing amateur teams have played the game at home.

For the second round, the teams are again divided into two pots according to the same principles. Depending on the results of the first round, the pots might not be equal in terms of numbers. Teams from one pot are drawn against teams from the other pot until one pot is empty. The remaining teams are then drawn against each other, with the team first drawn playing the game at home.

For the remaining rounds, other than the final, the teams are drawn from one pot. Since 1985, the final has been held in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin.

===Match rules===
Extra time will be played if the scores are level after 90 minutes, with a penalty shootout following if needed.

==History==

Historically, the number of participants in the main tournament has varied between four from 1956 until 1960, and 128 from 1973 through 1982, resulting in tournaments of two to seven rounds. Since the inception of the Bundesliga in 1963, all clubs from the Bundesliga are automatically qualified for the DFB-Pokal, as are all clubs from the 2. Bundesliga since its inception in 1974. Reserve sides, for most of the time, were allowed to participate in the DFB-Pokal, but have been excluded since 2008.

The final has been held at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin every season since 1985. Before 1985, the host of the final was determined on short notice. In the decision, the German Football Association took into consideration that, due to the political situation between West Germany and East Germany, Berlin was not chosen to be a venue for the UEFA Euro 1988.

Originally, the cup games were held over two 45 minute halves with two 15 minute overtime periods in case of a draw. If the score was still level after 120 minutes, the game was replayed with the home field right reversed. In the 1939 &quot;Tschammer-Pokal,&quot; the semi-final between Waldhof Mannheim and Wacker Wien was played to a draw three times before the game was decided by lot. The German Football Association decided to hold a penalty shootout if the replay was another draw after a similar situation arose in the 1970 cup, when the match between Alemannia Aachen and Werder Bremen had to be decided by lot after two draws.
In 1971–72 and 1972–73, the matches were held over two legs. The second leg was extended by two additional 15-minute overtime periods if the aggregate was a draw after both legs. In case the extension brought no decision, a penalty shootout was held.

In 1977, the final (between 1. FC Köln and Hertha BSC) had to be replayed, leading to great logistical difficulties. In the aftermath, the DFB opted not to replay cup finals in the future, instead holding a penalty shootout after extra time. Eventually, this change was extended to all cup games in 1991.

===International qualification===
Since 1960, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. If the cup winner had already qualified for the European Club Champions Cup, the losing finalist moved into the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup instead. Following the abolition of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1999, the winner of the DFB-Pokal qualified for the UEFA Cup (known as the UEFA Europa League since 2009). If the DFB-Pokal winner, or both finalists, qualify through the Bundesliga for European cup competitions, the best placed team of the Bundesliga not already qualified for at least the Europa League receives the spot.

===Tschammerpokal===
The first German cup was held in 1935. It was then called &quot;von Tschammer und Osten Pokal&quot;, or &quot;Tschammerpokal&quot; for short, named after &quot;Reichssportführer&quot; (Sports Chief of the Reich) Hans von Tschammer und Osten. The first final was contested between the two most successful clubs of that era, 1. FC Nürnberg and Schalke 04, with Nürnberg winning 2–0. After the last &quot;Tschammerpokal&quot; was held in 1943, the cup was not held for almost ten years, being re-introduced by the German Football Association (DFB) in 1952 under its current name, &quot;DFB-Pokal&quot;. In 1965, the original trophy, &quot;Goldfasanen-Pokal&quot;, was replaced by the trophy which is still awarded today, because the original reminded DFB president Peco Bauwens of the Nazi era.

===Giant killing===
Originally, the DFB-Pokal was a competition open to clubs from the top divisions of German football only. This continued after the establishment of the Bundesliga in 1963. Semi-professional and amateur clubs could only enter the competition from 1974 onwards, when it was enlarged. Up until 2008, only the top two divisions of German football, the Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, were fully professional but from 2008, with the establishment of the 3. Liga, the third tier also became fully professional.

From the start, the new match ups between Bundesliga and amateurs (most usually third division clubs) became a source of surprises. Hamburger SV&#x27;s second round loss to VfB Eppingen in 1974 was often titled the &quot;mother of all cup upsets&quot; (), the first instance of an amateur side knocking out a Bundesliga club. It took until 1990 for a fourth division side to achieve the same, when SpVgg Fürth took Borussia Dortmund out of the competition. Further milestones were the reserve side of Hertha BSC, Hertha BSC II, reaching the cup final in 1993, a first for a third division club and a reserve team. In 1997, Eintracht Trier proved too strong for both the UEFA Cup and Champions League winners, knocking Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund out of the competition. In 2000, 1. FC Magdeburg became the first fourth division side to eliminate two Bundesliga clubs in one season. Hannover 96, then playing in the 2. Bundesliga, became cup winners after eliminating several Bundesliga teams in the process. Kickers Offenbach won all matches including the semi-final as a 2. Bundesliga team, but were promoted to the Bundesliga a week before they won the cup final.

Surprise results in the cup attract strong media coverage in Germany and, at times, abroad. When TSV Vestenbergsgreuth eliminated Bayern Munich in 1994, who were then coached by the Italian Giovanni Trapattoni, Italian sports daily reported on its front page &quot;Club di dilettanti elimina Trapattoni&quot; (&quot;Amateur club eliminate Trapattoni&quot;).

==Records==

Having won 20 titles, Bayern Munich has been the most successful team in the cup since they won their fourth title in 1969. Fortuna Düsseldorf established a record for consecutive German Cup match victories (18 straight victories between 1978 and 1981, taking the trophy in 1979 and 1980). Werder Bremen has won the most consecutive home games (37 between 1988 and 2019). Bayern Munich has won the most consecutive away games (33 between 2009 and 2020). Schalke 04 holds the record for the biggest win in a DFB-Pokal final, winning 5–0 against 1. FC Kaiserslautern in 1972 and 5–0 against MSV Duisburg in 2011.

==East German Cup (1949–91)==
East Germany also had its own national cup: the FDGB Cup, the cup of the &quot;Freie Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund&quot;, the association of the East German trade unions. It was introduced in 1949 and awarded annually until 1991, after German reunification in 1990 led to the merger of the two German football leagues.

==Women&#x27;s German Cup==
Since 1981, women&#x27;s football clubs have competed for the DFB-Pokal Frauen. An East German women&#x27;s cup was also held from 1987 to 1991.

<doc id="675127" wikidata="Q844462" url="?curid=675127" title="Ryes">
<text>Ryes () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Population==
==Administration==
Ryes was the seat of the former canton of Ryes, which included 25 communes. Since 2015, it is part of the canton of Bayeux.

==Toponymy==

In 1060, Ryes was mentioned under the name Rigia.

The ancient forms of its name are apparently related to the French word &quot;raie&quot; (Old French &quot;roie&quot;), deriving from the Gallo-Roman &quot;rica&quot;, from the Gallic word &quot;Rica&quot; meaning a &quot;furrow&quot;: cf. Middle Gallic &quot;Rych&quot;, meaning a &quot;groove&quot;, and Old Breton &quot;rec&quot; (modern Breton &quot;rec&#x27;h&quot;), meaning a &quot;tear&quot;. The word occurred throughout the Gallo-Roman region and is attested in Low Latin in the forms &quot;riga&quot;, &quot;rega&quot; and &quot;rige&quot; (FEW volume 10, pp. 393–394).

==History==

Lord Hubert of Ryes welcomed Duke William during his struggle with his rebellious barons. He then saved William by sending him to Falaise escorted by his three sons while Hubert sent the rebellious barons in another direction.

On 1 July 1899, a 60 cm gauge shortline railroad between Courseulles and Bayeux was opened by Railways Calvados. The same day, a branch starting from Ryes to Arromanches also entered service. The main line and the branch were decommissioned from the network on 29 September 1932.

<doc id="675128" wikidata="Q2823943" url="?curid=675128" title="Adam Everett">
<text>Jeffery Adam Everett (born February 5, 1977) is an American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played college baseball for both the NC State Wolfpack and South Carolina Gamecocks. He was drafted in the first round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft and established himself for his defensive prowess as the starting shortstop for the Houston Astros in 2003. Everett continued his involvement in baseball as a roving infield instructor for the Astros minor league system, and was named bench coach for the Astros on September 1, 2014.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
The Chicago Cubs drafted Everett in the fourth round (91st overall) of the 1995 Major League Baseball draft out of Harrison High School. He did not sign with the team, and he was later selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first round (12th overall) of the 1998 draft.

During the 1998 and 1999 seasons, Everett played for the Single-A Lowell Spinners and Double-A Trenton Thunder before he was traded to the Houston Astros for outfielder Carl Everett on December 14, 1999.

In 2000, he played 126 games for the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs, where he batted .245 with five home runs and 37 RBI. Taking a break from minor league baseball, he traveled to Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he helped the US team capture the gold medal.

===Houston Astros===
Everett made his Major League debut on August 30, 2001 against the Cincinnati Reds, appearing as a defensive replacement at shortstop in the ninth inning. He scored his first run against the San Francisco Giants on September 18 to tie the game at 2–2 in the ninth inning. He appeared in nine games for the Astros that season, going 0-for-3 with one run scored and a stolen base. In 114 games with New Orleans, he batted .249 with five home runs and 40 RBI.

In 2002, Everett appeared in 40 games for the Astros, batting .193 with 4 RBI. With New Orleans, he hit .275 with two home runs and 25 RBI in 88 games. He was called up again in 2003 and played 128 games for the Astros, batting .256 with eight home runs and 51 RBI. On August 6, Everett hit the first ever inside-the-park home run at Minute Maid Park against the New York Mets. On July 9, he hit his first career grand slam against the Cincinnati Reds.

Everett finished second in the 2004 National League All-Star balloting for shortstops behind the St. Louis Cardinals&#x27; Édgar Rentería.

In 2005, Everett hit .248 with a career-high 11 home runs and 54 RBI in 152 games. He helped the Astros reached the World Series, where he went 1-for-15 as the Astros were swept in four games by the Chicago White Sox.

Everett was honored with a Fielding Bible Award as the best fielding MLB shortstop in 2006. According to Baseball-Reference.com, he posted a defensive wins above replacement of 4.1, which was the highest recorded mark in the majors that year. Everett also led the majors in total zone runs with 40, the highest for any position in baseball since 1952. However, Omar Vizquel won the Gold Glove at shortstop for 2006, based on voting from coaches and managers.

On April 9, 2007, Everett became the all-time shortstop home run leader for the Houston Astros, hitting his 34th career home run.

On June 14, 2007, Everett was involved in a collision with left fielder Carlos Lee while chasing down a fly ball, and was diagnosed with a fractured fibula. He missed three months with the injury, and returned to action in September for three games. In 66 games, Everett batted .232 with two home runs and 15 RBI.

===Minnesota Twins===
On December 12, 2007, Everett was not offered a contract renewal by the Astros, who had recently traded for shortstop Miguel Tejada. He signed a one-year, $2.8 million contract with the Minnesota Twins the next day. He played in 48 games with the Twins, batting .213 with two home runs and 20 RBI.

===Detroit Tigers===
On December 15, 2008, Everett signed a one-year deal with the Detroit Tigers worth $1 million plus incentives. He played in 118 games, batting .238 with three home runs and 44 RBI. On December 7, 2009, Everett signed another one-year deal with Detroit, worth $1.55 million.

On June 6, 2010, the Tigers designated Everett for assignment, replacing him with rookie shortstop Danny Worth. Everett was released by the Tigers on June 15.

===Cleveland Indians===
On December 16, 2010, Everett signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians with an invitation to spring training. On March 28, 2011, it was announced that he had earned a place on the Indians&#x27; roster as a utility infielder. He was designated for assignment on June 27 and released on June 30.

===Retirement===
Everett retired on January 13, 2012, and was hired by the Indians front office to be a special assistant to baseball operations. In 2014, Everett returned to the Houston Astros as a roving infield instructor for the minor league system. On September 1, 2014, Everett was named the bench coach for the major league team.

<text>Molecular physics is the study of the physical properties of molecules and molecular dynamics. The field overlaps significantly with physical chemistry, chemical physics, and quantum chemistry. It is often considered as a sub-field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. Research groups studying molecular physics are typically designated as one of these other fields. Molecular physics addresses phenomena due to both molecular structure and individual atomic processes within molecules. Like atomic physics, it relies on a combination of classical and quantum mechanics to describe interactions between electromagnetic radiation and matter. Experiments in the field often rely heavily on techniques borrowed from atomic physics, such as spectroscopy and scattering.

== Molecular structure ==

In a molecule, both the electrons and nuclei experience similar-scale forces from the Coulomb interaction. However, the nuclei remain at nearly fixed locations in the molecule while the electrons move significantly. This picture of a molecule is based on the idea that nucleons are much heavier than electrons, so will move much less in response to the same force. Neutron scattering experiments on molecules have been used to verify this description.

=== Molecular energy levels and spectra ===

When atoms join into molecules, their inner electrons remain bound to their original nucleus while the outer valence electrons are distributed around the molecule. The charge distribution of these valence electrons determines the electronic energy level of a molecule, and can be described by molecular orbital theory, which closely follows the atomic orbital theory used for single atoms. Assuming that the momenta of the electrons are on the order of &quot;ħ&quot;/&quot;a&quot; (where &quot;ħ&quot; is the reduced Planck constant and &quot;a&quot; is the average internuclear distance within a molecule, ~ 1 Å), the magnitude of the energy spacing for electronic states can be estimated at a few electron volts. This is the case for most low-lying molecular energy states, and corresponds to transitions in the visible and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition to the electronic energy levels shared with atoms, molecules have additional quantized energy levels corresponding to vibrational and rotational states. Vibrational energy levels refer to motion of the nuclei about their equilibrium positions in the molecule. The approximate energy spacing of these levels can be estimated by treating each nucleus as a quantum harmonic oscillator in the potential produced by the molecule, and comparing its associated frequency to that of an electron experiencing the same potential. The result is an energy spacing about 100× smaller than that for electronic levels. In agreement with this estimate, vibrational spectra show transitions in the near infrared (about ). Finally, rotational energy states describe semi-rigid rotation of the entire molecule and produce transition wavelengths in the far infrared and microwave regions (about 100-10,000 μm in wavelength). These are the smallest energy spacings, and their size can be understood by comparing the energy of a diatomic molecule with internuclear spacing ~ 1 Å to the energy of a valence electron (estimated above as ~ &quot;ħ&quot;/&quot;a&quot;).

Actual molecular spectra also show transitions which simultaneously couple electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. For example, transitions involving both rotational and vibrational states are often referred to as rotational-vibrational or rovibrational transitions. Vibronic transitions combine electronic and vibrational transitions, and rovibronic transitions combine electronic, rotational, and vibrational transitions. Due to the very different frequencies associated with each type of transition, the wavelengths associated with these mixed transitions vary across the electromagnetic spectrum.

== Experiments ==

In general, the goals of molecular physics experiments are to characterize shape and size, electric and magnetic properties, internal energy levels, and ionization and dissociation energies for molecules. In terms of shape and size, rotational spectra and vibrational spectra allow for the determination of molecular moments of inertia, which allows for calculations of internuclear distances in molecules. X-ray diffraction allows determination of internuclear spacing directly, especially for molecules containing heavy elements. All branches of spectroscopy contribute to determination of molecular energy levels due to the wide range of applicable energies (ultraviolet to microwave regimes).

=== Current research ===

Within atomic, molecular, and optical physics, there are numerous studies using molecules to verify fundamental constants and probe for physics beyond the Standard Model. Certain molecular structures are predicted to be sensitive to new physics phenomena, such as parity and time-reversal violation. Molecules are also considered a potential future platform for trapped ion quantum computing, as their more complex energy level structure could facilitate higher efficiency encoding of quantum information than individual atoms. From a chemical physics perspective, intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution experiments use vibrational spectra to determine how energy is redistributed between different quantum states of a vibrationally excited molecule.

<text>The Apalachicola River is a river, approximately long, in the state of Florida. The river&#x27;s large watershed, known as the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint (ACF) River Basin, drains an area of approximately into the Gulf of Mexico. The distance to its farthest head waters (as the Chattahoochee River) in northeast Georgia is approximately . Its name comes from Apalachicola Province, an association of Native American towns located on what is now the Chattahoochee River. The Spanish included what is now called the Chattahoochee River as part of one river, calling all of it from its origins in the southern Appalachian foothills down to the Gulf of Mexico the &quot;Apalachicola&quot;.

==Description==
The river is formed on the state line between Florida and Georgia, near the town of Chattahoochee, Florida, approximately northeast of Panama City, by the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers. The actual confluence is contained within the Lake Seminole reservoir formed by the Jim Woodruff Dam. It flows generally south through the forests of the Florida Panhandle, past Bristol. In northern Gulf County, it receives the Chipola River from the west. It flows into Apalachicola Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, at Apalachicola, Florida. The lower of the river is surrounded by extensive swamps and wetlands, except at the coast.

The watershed contains nationally significant forests, with some of the highest biological diversity east of the Mississippi River and rivaling that of the Great Smoky Mountains. It has significant areas of temperate deciduous forest as well as longleaf pine landscapes and flatwoods. Flooded areas have significant tracts of floodplain forest. All of these southeastern forest types were devastated by logging between 1880 and 1920, and the Apalachicola contains some of the finest remaining examples of old growth forest in the southeast. The endangered tree species Florida torreya is endemic to the region; it clings to forested slopes and bluffs in Torreya State Park along the east bank of the river. The highest point within the watershed is Blood Mountain at , near the headwaters of the Chattahoochee River.

Where the river enters the Gulf of Mexico, it creates a rich array of wetlands varying in salinity. These include tidal marshes and seagrass meadows. Over of this diverse delta complex are included within the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve. There are also dunes with coastal grasslands and interdunal swales.
The basin of the Apalachicola River is also noted for its Tupelo honey, a high-quality monofloral honey, which is produced wherever the tupelo trees bloom in the southeastern United States. In a good harvest year, the value of the tupelo honey crop produced by a group of specialized Florida beekeepers approaches $900,000 each spring.

During Florida&#x27;s British colonial period, the river formed the boundary between East Florida and West Florida. Geologically, the river links the coastal plain and Gulf Coast with the Appalachian Mountains.

Some of the remaining important areas of natural habitat along the river include Apalachicola National Forest, Torreya State Park, The Nature Conservancy Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve, Tates Hell State Forest, and Apalachicola River Wildlife and Environmental Area, as well as the Apalachicola River Water Management Area. It has been suggested that this watershed should be nationally ranked and appreciated as being as significant as the Everglades or Great Smoky Mountains. To raise awareness about the importance of preserving the natural state of the river and its inhabitants, Florida film producer Elam Stoltzfus highlighted this system in a 2006 documentary broadcast on PBS.

The river forms the boundary between the Eastern and Central time zones in Florida, until it reaches the Jackson River. Thereafter, the Jackson River, which flows to the Gulf of Mexico, is the time zone boundary.

<text>Sir Anthony Denny (16 January 1501 – 10 September 1549) was Groom of the Stool to King Henry VIII of England, thus his closest courtier and confidant. In 1539 he was appointed a gentleman of the privy chamber and was its most prominent member in King Henry&#x27;s last years, having together with his brother-in-law, John Gates, charge of the &quot;dry stamp&quot; of the King&#x27;s signature, and attended the King on his deathbed. He was a member of the Reformist circle that offset the conservative religious influence of Bishop Gardiner. He was a wealthy man, having acquired several manors and former religious sites distributed by the Court of Augmentations after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. 
==Life==
Anthony Denny was the second son of Sir Edmund Denny (d. 22 December 1520), a Baron of the Exchequer, by his second wife, Mary Troutbeck, the daughter and coheir of Robert Troutbeck of Bridge Trafford in Cheshire. He had an elder brother, Sir Thomas Denny, of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, who married Elizabeth Monoux, the daughter of Sir George Monoux, Lord Mayor of London, as well as two younger brothers and ten sisters, including Martha.

Denny was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and tradition asserts, at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was first a servant of the courtier Francis Bryan, and joined the king&#x27;s household in 1533 as a groom of the privy chamber. He was appointed keeper of Whitehall Palace in January 1536. Jane Seymour gave him a brooch. He was made Yeoman of the Robes in September 1537.

He was present at the wedding of Henry VIII to Catherine Parr in the Queen&#x27;s Privy Closet at Hampton Court on 12 July 1543. In 1544, he joined Henry&#x27;s military expedition to France. He was knighted at the capture of Boulogne in 1544. He became Groom of the Stool in October 1546. He oversaw the use and maintenance of the king&#x27;s close stool.

In 1547, he was elected knight of the shire (MP) for Hertfordshire. By 1548, he was keeper of the Palace of Westminster.

Along with Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, John Dudley, Viscount Lisle, and Sir William Paget, Denny helped to finalise King Henry VIII&#x27;s will upon his deathbed in 1547. Denny specifically argued to the King on several occasions against the removal of Bishop Gardiner from the will. Denny was himself the man to tell King Henry of his coming death, advising the old King &quot;to prepare for his final agony&quot;. His position gave him both the power to control who saw King Henry VIII in his last years (in which he spent much time in the Privy Chambers), and the power to influence, through his personal relationship with the ageing King. Along with Sir William Paget, the Principal Secretary, Denny is suspected of having fixed the choosing of the &quot;Progressive&quot; appeals, headed by Edward Seymour.

In 1549, during the Seymour affair, Denny was sent to Hatfield House to arrest the Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s cofferer Thomas Parry and his sister-in-law Kat Ashley. Denny joined the forces raised against Kett&#x27;s Rebellion in August 1549.

He died on 10 September 1549. Denny is buried without surviving stone memorials at St. Mary parish church at Cheshunt, the family seat in Hertfordshire.

==Marriage and family==
In 1525, Denny married Joan Champernowne, the daughter of Sir Philip Champernowne, and the close friend of King Henry VIII&#x27;s wife, Catherine Parr. She is thought to have been the sister of Kat Ashley, governess of the Lady Elizabeth. They had 12 children, including:
* Henry Denny, Dean of Chester (d. 24 March 1574). He married, firstly, Honory Grey, daughter of William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton and Mary Somerset. Their son was Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich. His second wife was Elizabeth Grey, by whom he had a son, who died unmarried.
* Edward Denny (soldier) (1547–1599), who married Margaret Edgcumbe, daughter of Sir Piers Edgcumbe (1536 - c. 1607).
* Mary Denny, who married Thomas Astley of Writtle, one of the grooms of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth I.
Three of his sons, who were also reformers, exiled themselves from England under Mary I of England.

<doc id="675137" wikidata="Q390945" url="?curid=675137" title="Agate Fossil Beds National Monument">
<text>Agate Fossil Beds National Monument is a U.S. National Monument near Harrison, Nebraska. The main features of the monument are a valley of the Niobrara River and the fossils found on Carnegie Hill and University Hill.

The area largely consists of grass-covered plains. Plants on the site include prairie sandreed, blue grama, little bluestem and needle and thread grass, and the wildflowers lupin, spiderwort, western wallflower and sunflowers.

== History ==
Originally the Agate Springs Ranch, a working cattle ranch, was owned by Capt. James Cook. The monument&#x27;s museum collection also contains more than 500 artifacts from the Cook Collection of Plains Indians artifacts.

The national monument was authorized on June 5, 1965, but was not established until June 14, 1997. The Harold J. Cook Homestead (Bone Cabin Complex) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Agate Fossil Beds is maintained by the National Park Service.

== Paleontology ==
The site is best known for a large number of well-preserved Miocene fossils, many of which were found at dig sites on Carnegie and University Hills. Fossils from the Harrison Formation and Anderson Ranch Formation, which date to the Arikareean in the North American land mammal classification, about 20 to 16.3 million years ago, are among some of the best specimens of Miocene mammals.

Species found in Agate include:
* &quot;Miohippus&quot;, &quot;Merychippus&quot; and &quot;Parahippus&quot;, ancestors of the modern day horse.
* &quot;Diceratherium&quot;, two-horned rhinoceros.
* &quot;Menoceras&quot;, pony-sized rhinoceros, the most common animal found in the fossil beds.
* &quot;Daphoenodon&quot; and &quot;Ysengrinia&quot;, two types of mid-sized bear dogs.
* &quot;Promerycochoerus&quot;, a semiaquatic hippo-like oreodont.
* &quot;Daeodon&quot;, the largest Entelodont (giant pig-like ungulate).
* &quot;Stenomylus&quot;, gazelle-like camelids.
* &quot;Oxydactylus&quot;, giraffe-like camelids.
* &quot;Palaeocastor&quot;, land beavers that dug large corkscrew-shaped burrows (&quot;Daemonelix&quot;).
* &quot;Moropus&quot;, a chalicothere which are relatives of rhinos and horses.
* &quot;Merychyus&quot;, a sheep-like oreodont.
* &quot;Syndyoceras&quot;, antelope-like mammal and extinct relatives of artiodactyls.

<doc id="675150" wikidata="Q419607" url="?curid=675150" title="2004 Monaco Grand Prix">
<text>The 2004 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2004) was a Formula One motor race held on 23 May 2004, at the Circuit de Monaco, contested over 77 laps. It was Race 6 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship. The race was won by Renault driver Jarno Trulli; his only victory in Formula One. BAR driver, Jenson Button finished in second position, one second behind Trulli and Rubens Barrichello took the third and final podium spot for Ferrari.

In fine conditions Trulli beat Button to the first corner off the grid, and the fast starting Takuma Sato beat Kimi Räikkönen and Michael Schumacher to fourth place before retiring at the end of the second lap. On lap three the safety car was deployed due to a collision between David Coulthard and Giancarlo Fisichella, with the race resuming on lap seven. The two Renault drivers, Trulli and Fernando Alonso remained close together at the front of the race until the pit stops which briefly saw Michael Schumacher lead the race. Alonso retired after crashing trying to lap Ralf Schumacher, and a second safety car period ensued. After briefly leading, Michael Schumacher retired behind the safety car following a collision with Juan Pablo Montoya, who subsequently finished fourth. Schumacher&#x27;s retirement elevated Button to second, and Trulli to the lead. Button subsequently reduced Trulli&#x27;s lead, and the pair raced closely until the finish.

The race was Trulli&#x27;s sole victory of his F1 career. The retirement of Michael Schumacher, the defending Drivers&#x27; Champion, brought to an end his run of five successive victories from the inaugural race of the season. Despite his retirement, Schumacher departed Monaco as the points leader, ahead of Barrichello and Button. Trulli&#x27;s victory placed him ten points ahead of his teammate Alonso. Ferrari maintained their lead in the Constructors&#x27; Championship, 36 points ahead of Renault and 48 ahead of BAR, with 12 races of the season remaining.

==Report==

===Practice and qualifying===

Four practice sessions were held before the qualifying session, two on the Thursday before the race, and two on Saturday morning before the qualifying session. The driver&#x27;s championship leader, the Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher, was fastest in all four practice sessions, and in the final session set a record lap time for the Monaco circuit, of 1:14.014. Schumacher&#x27;s record time was set in response to a fast lap time from Jarno Trulli. The Jaguar driver Mark Webber suffered an engine failure in the final practice session, and for changing his engine suffered an automatic 10 place grid penalty for the subsequent qualifying session, a penalty also suffered by Ralf Schumacher, for an engine failure in the first practice session.

The Bridgestone tyres used by Schumacher were inferior to the Michelin tyres used by the Renault, BAR and Williams teams at the Monaco weekend. In the weeks before the Monaco race Bridgestone had worked with the Ferrari team on tyres that could perform a fast single lap during qualifying and the opening laps of the race. Schumacher had set his fast practice times on soft tyres, but after his tyres had struggled on a slippery track, Schumacher and the other Bridgestone teams returned to hard tyres.

===Qualifying===

Michael Schumacher had won pole at four of the last five races. In recent years the Monaco Grand Prix had rarely been won from pole position, the last winner from pole before 2004 had been Mika Häkkinen at the 1998 Monaco Grand Prix and Michael Schumacher at the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix.

The first four fastest times in qualifying were set by cars with Michelin tyres. The Sauber team decided to use the soft Bridgestone tyre and their performance had suffered, with their drivers qualifying 10th and 16th.

Renault driver Jarno Trulli set his pole time of 1m13.985s, it was the fastest ever recorded around the Monaco circuit, and was the first pole position of his career. His time was 0.411 faster than the next driver. Trulli had previously started on the front row at Monaco in 2000. Of his first pole Trulli said that &quot;I&#x27;m pretty impressed over my lap time because I couldn&#x27;t believe I lapped under the 14s...I put in a very impressive lap. In Monaco, being on pole, which is something I have chased for such a long time, I&#x27;m so pleased.&quot;

BAR driver Jenson Button started the race alongside Trulli on the front row, although Williams driver Ralf Schumacher had qualified second, he was demoted to twelfth for changing his engine. Ralf Schumacher had qualified on pole at Monaco at the previous year&#x27;s race. Trulli&#x27;s Renault teammate Fernando Alonso qualified third, with Michael Schumacher eventually qualified fifth. Michael Schumacher was moved to fourth following his brother Ralf&#x27;s demotion. Takuma Sato qualified seventh after a fast time in the first sector of the circuit, but a driving error damaged his chances of a quick lap.

Following the qualifying session, a mini-bus carrying the session&#x27;s three fastest drivers was hit by a car. No one was hurt in the incident. Trulli described the accident as &quot;...a big surprise...Maybe they thought we had not taken enough risks already on the track. But I don&#x27;t think so. Not during qualifying in Monte Carlo.&quot;

===Race===
The race began with Trulli on pole and BAR&#x27;s Jenson Button behind; Renault&#x27;s Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher occupied the second row. After two aborted starts (Olivier Panis stalled his Toyota and Trulli&#x27;s Renault leaked coolant onto the track) the parade lap began; Panis stalled again and started the race from the pits. As the race began, BAR&#x27;s Takuma Sato made an excellent start, moving from eighth to fourth in seconds. Presently Sato&#x27;s engine began smoking; on the third lap, it exploded spectacularly and released an enormous cloud of smoke, in which Sauber&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella collided with McLaren’s David Coulthard and overturned. Both drivers were unhurt but out of the race, as was Sato.

Out came the yellow flags, and the race proceeded under the safety car until the eighth lap, at which point Alonso fought Trulli for the lead, followed by Button. When the race restarted, Juan Pablo Montoya moved past Rubens Barrichello to take sixth position, and Trulli set three consecutive fastest laps, but was only able to increase his lead to 1.2 seconds over Alonso. The leaders began their first pit stops on lap 18, and by Michael Schumacher&#x27;s stop on lap 26, Trulli led from Alonso, with Schumacher now in third ahead of both Kimi Räikkönen and Button.

On lap 28, Räikkönen retired with mechanical troubles, joining Jaguar&#x27;s Christian Klien and Mark Webber, as well as Jordan&#x27;s Giorgio Pantano and Minardi&#x27;s Gianmaria Bruni on the sidelines.
In an attempt to lap Ralf Schumacher, who was down in 11th position, Alonso tried to pass him offline around the outside in the tunnel and crashed heavily. Alonso was enraged by this incident, and publicly accused Ralf of dangerous driving. The safety car was immediately deployed, and all of the front-runners (except Michael Schumacher and Montoya) took the opportunity to pit. While following the safety car, Schumacher locked his left front tyre in the tunnel in an apparent attempt to generate heat in his brake pads and discs ahead of the restart. Montoya, directly behind, moved to the inside trying to avoid running into the back of Schumacher. However, as Schumacher continued there was no space between his car and the barrier for Montoya&#x27;s and he clipped Montoya&#x27;s left front tyre with his right rear, spun sideways and hit the barriers. This accident ended Schumacher&#x27;s hopes for a sixth consecutive victory and a perfect season. Upon investigations, the stewards declined to apportion blame to either driver.

As the order settled down towards the end of the race, Trulli led from Button, with Barrichello in third. The top three were a lap in front of the rest of the field, and the only drivers with a chance of winning the race. Barrichello needed to pit with 22 laps remaining, and rejoined too far behind the top two in order to make a challenge. From then on, it was a straight fight between Trulli and Button, but the Circuit de Monaco is notoriously the hardest circuit to make a passing move on. Therefore, Button having no chance of passing, Trulli took the win by close to half a second.

Following what would turn out to be the only Grand Prix win of his Formula One career, Trulli was left literally speechless during interviews, having teammate Alonso conduct interviews on his behalf.

Jaguar unveiled a special Monaco livery to promote the new &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; film. The car&#x27;s airbox and red-painted nose feature the movie&#x27;s logo, and the car&#x27;s nose features a diamond worth $300.000 owned by jewelry brand Steinmetz. Klien crashed into the guardrails at the Loews hairpin on the first lap. When Jaguar personnel arrived at the crash site, the diamond was gone.

==Thursday drivers==
The bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Thursday. These drivers drove on Thursday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

<doc id="675151" wikidata="Q17012239" url="?curid=675151" title="List of rivers of the Americas by coastline">
<text>This list of rivers of the Americas by coastline includes the major coastal rivers of the Americas arranged by country. A link to a map of rivers with known coordinates is listed at right. The ocean coasts are demarcated as follows: 
*Arctic Ocean coast (including Hudson Bay) from Cape Prince of Wales east to Cape Chidley
*Atlantic Ocean coast from Cape Chidley south to Cape Virgins
*Pacific Ocean coast from Cape Prince of Wales south to Cape Virgins
*Endorheic basin coast (drainage basins not reaching oceans)

This is a counterpart to the primarily alphabetical List of rivers of the Americas and other lists of rivers of countries, although only rivers which reach the ocean are included here, not tributaries.

==Arctic Ocean coast==

In the Americas, only the United States, Canada, and Greenland have rivers on the Arctic Ocean coast. Greenland is surrounded by the Barents Sea (part of the Arctic Ocean), the Greenland Sea (often described as part of the Arctic Ocean), Baffin Bay to the west (marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean), the Labrador Sea to the south (part of the Arctic Ocean), and directly to the Arctic Ocean to the north. The following is a list of rivers flowing into the Arctic Ocean. The province and country where the mouth is located are included.

==Atlantic Ocean coast==

The Atlantic Ocean has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs and seas. These include the Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, part of the Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Labrador Sea, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Norwegian Sea, almost all of the Scotia Sea, and other tributary water bodies. Including these marginal seas the coast line of the Atlantic measures compared to for the Pacific.

The rivers in the following sections flow into the Atlantic Ocean, unless indicated otherwise. The rivers of Cuba and several other countries flow into the Caribbean Sea which connects to the Atlantic Ocean. Some rivers also flow into the Gulf of Mexico before the water reaches the main Atlantic Ocean. A few of the major, notable rivers flowing into the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico are included below.

<doc id="675157" wikidata="Q1423403" url="?curid=675157" title="Seversky P-35">
<text>The Seversky P-35 is an American fighter aircraft built by the Seversky Aircraft Company in the late 1930s. A contemporary of the Hawker Hurricane and Messerschmitt Bf 109, the P-35 was the first single-seat fighter in United States Army Air Corps to feature all-metal construction, retractable landing gear, and an enclosed cockpit.

==Design and development==
The origins of the P-35 can be traced back to the Seversky SEV-3 three-seat amphibian, designed by Alexander Kartveli, Seversky&#x27;s chief designer and Seversky&#x27;s first aircraft. The SEV-3 first flew in June 1933 and was developed into the Seversky BT-8 basic trainer, 30 of which were ordered by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) in 1935. This proved grossly underpowered and was quickly replaced by the North American BT-9.

The second prototype SEV-3 was completed as a two-seat fighter derivative, the SEV-2XP. It was powered by a 735 hp (548 kW) Wright R-1820 radial engine, had fixed landing gear in aerodynamic spats and was armed with one .50 in (12.7 mm) and one .30 in (7.62 mm) forward-firing machine guns plus an additional .30 in (7.62 mm) gun for rear defence.

When the USAAC announced a competition for a new single-seat fighter in 1935, Seversky sent the SEV-2XP, confident it would win despite being a two-seater. However, the aircraft was damaged on 18 June 1935 during its transit to the fly-offs at Wright Field. To compete with the Curtiss Model 75, a single-seat aircraft with retractable undercarriage, Seversky rebuilt the aircraft into the single seat SEV-1XP, replacing the SEV-2XP&#x27;s fixed landing gear with a retractable undercarriage where the mainwheels retracted backwards into the wing, and an 850 hp (634 kW) R-1820-G5 replacing the -F3 of the SEV-2XP. The SEV-1XP was delivered to Wright Field on 15 August for evaluation, which was generally successful, although the Cyclone failed to deliver its rated power and the SEV-1XP only reached 289 mph (465 km/h) rather than the 300 mph (483 km/h) predicted by Seversky.

Protests from Curtiss led to the formal flyoff between the fighters to be delayed until April 1936. The delay was used by both Seversky and Curtiss to improve their aircraft, while allowing additional fighters from Vought (the Vought V-141) and Consolidated with a single seat version of the PB-2. The SEV-1XP was re-engined again, with a two-row Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-9 &quot;Twin Wasp&quot; replacing the Cyclone and a modified vertical stabilizer fitted, becoming the SEV-7.

The P&amp;W also failed to deliver its rated power as it put out only , and top speed was again well below 300 mph. While more expensive than the Curtiss and Vought designs, the Seversky was a clear winner of the Air Corps&#x27; competition, with an order for 77 P-35 fighters and spare parts equivalent to eight airplanes being placed on 16 June 1936 at a cost of $1,636,250. Modifications from SEV-1XP to production P-35 standard included partial instead of complete mainwheel fairings and seven degrees of dihedral to the outer wing panels.

The first production P-35 was delivered to the USAAC in May 1937, preceded by a company owned pre-production aircraft and demonstrator, the AP-1. Only 76 P-35s were built, delivery being completed in August 1938, with the 77th aircraft finished as the prototype XP-41. When it wanted further fighters in 1937, the Air Corps, who were unhappy with both the slow delivery of the P-35, and sale of 2PA two-seat aircraft to the Japanese Navy, ordered 210 Curtiss P-36s.

Also in 1937, a P-35 with naval equipment was supplied to the United States Navy for a design competition to replace the Navy&#x27;s biplane fighters with an all-metal monoplane. Contrary to usual Navy practice, the single test aircraft was operated under civil aircraft registration as &quot;NX1254&quot; and was not assigned a formal Navy serial number nor a type designation, and was instead operated as the NF-1, a company designation standing for &quot;Naval Fighter One&quot;. The prototype competed against the Brewster F2A and Grumman F4F, but was found unsatisfactory, with the F2A being ordered into production. According to some sources, the type designation of FN was assigned to the Seversky under the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system, but others claim this is in error.

Seversky continued to develop the design with the hope of selling more aircraft both to the Air Corps and to civil and export customers. It modified the prototype SEV-1XP as a single seat racer, the S-1 entering it into the 1937 Bendix Trophy, where it finished in fourth place. The competition was won by the S-2 (registration number NR70Y), a similar aircraft built for Frank Fuller of the Fuller Paint Company. S-2 also won the Bendix Trophy in 1939 and placed second in 1938. The aircraft was used to portray the &quot;Drake Bullet&quot; in the 1938 film &quot;Test Pilot&quot;.

Another civil aircraft was the DS, (or Doolittle Special), a single seater for James Doolittle, employed at the time by the Shell Oil Company, while the AP-7 was another racer, powered by a 1,200 hp (895 kW) R-1830 engine and used by Jacqueline Cochran to win the 1938 Bendix Trophy race and to set a women&#x27;s air speed record. Seversky entered two aircraft based on the P-35 in a 1938 competition for a new fighter for the Air Corps. One was the XP-41 (which had the company designation AP-4D, which was a P-35 with a 1,200 hp (895 kW) R-1830-9 engine fitted with a two-stage supercharger) and the AP-4, which had a turbo-supercharger mounted in the belly of a deeper fuselage. The Air Corps preferred the AP-4D, which was ordered into production as the P-43 Lancer.

Aiming to increase sales, Alexander P. de Seversky personally took a demonstrator on a tour of Europe in early 1939. As a result of this demonstration, Sweden ordered 15 EP-106 fighters on 29 June 1939, a development of the P-35 powered by a 1,050 hp (783 kW) R-1830-45, which improved performance by over 25 mph (40 km/h) and armed with two 7.9 mm (.311 in) machine guns in the cowl and two 13.2 mm (.52 in) machine guns in the wings. A second order for 45 EP-106s was placed on 11 October 1939, with a third order for 60 aircraft, placed on 6 January 1940, although by this time Seversky had been thrown out of the company bearing his name by the board of directors, with the company renaming itself Republic Aviation. The Swedish Air Force designated them J 9.

===Two-seat versions===

Seversky also built a two-seater, the 2PA. Evolved in parallel with the P-35, the 2PA was a two-seat fighter and fighter-bomber with a fundamentally similar airframe and offered with either a similar undercarriage to that of the single-seater as the 2PA-L (Land) or with an amphibious float undercarriage as the 2PA-A (Amphibian). Dubbed &quot;Convoy Fighter&quot; by the manufacturer, the 2PA was powered by a Wright R-1820-G2 or G3 Cyclone nine-cylinder radial engine, the former rated at 1,000 hp for take-off and the latter at 875 hp. Armament comprised two wing-mounted 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm Browning guns, one 7.62 mm Browning on a flexible mount in the rear cockpit, plus two forward-firing fuselage-mounted 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm Browning guns. Provision was made for a bomb load of up to 227 kg (500 lb) on internal wing racks. One 2PA-A and one 2PA-L were procured by the Soviet Union in March 1938, one with conventional landing gear and one with floats, along with the manufacturing license, but it appears that the Soviets never put it into production. In what proved to be an unpopular move for Seversky, 20 2PA-B3s were sold to the Japanese Navy, which briefly employed them in the Second Sino-Japanese War as Navy Type S Two-Seat Fighter or A8V-1 (Allied codename &quot;Dick&quot;). The Japanese were unimpressed with the aircraft and eventually relegated two of them to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper as &quot;hacks.&quot; Sweden ordered 52 2PAs (Swedish designation B 6), able to carry 1,350 lb (612 kg) of bombs, but received only two prior to the U.S. embargo directed to combatants. The remaining 50 were appropriated by the USAAC, re-armed with 0.30 in and 0.50 in machine guns, and used as advanced trainers named AT-12 Guardsman.

==Operational history==
===United States Army Air Corps===
The first P-35s were delivered to the 1st Pursuit Group (27th, 71st and 94th PS) stationed at Selfridge Field in Michigan. The aircraft used a wet wing to save weight and ground personnel quickly learned about the persistent fuel leaks. The P-35&#x27;s performance was poor even by contemporary standards and, although USAAC aviators appreciated the aircraft&#x27;s ruggedness, it was already obsolete by the time deliveries were finished in 1938.

On 18 June 1940, United States declared an embargo against exporting weapons to any nation other than the United Kingdom. Optimistically, Republic continued to manufacture EP-106s which, by the 24 October 1940 order, 60 were taken over by the USAAC as the P-35A. The aircraft were re-armed to American standards with a pair of 0.50 in machine guns that fired through the propeller, but retained the Swedish specification of a 0.30 in machine gun mounted in each wing. Flight instruments were metric, and both their labeling and flight manuals written in Swedish. Of these, three aircraft were kept in United States as instructional airframes for mechanics. Six P-35As were delivered to Ecuador to form the first combat unit, the &quot;Escuadrilla de Caza&quot;.

===Philippine Army Air Corps===

The remainder were sent to the Far East Air Force in the Philippines beginning in February 1941. Eventually all pilots of the three pursuit squadrons on Luzon transitioned to the P-35A from the P-26. About 10 of these were lost in accidents. The P-35s were used primarily as gunnery trainers by all three squadrons because of a critical shortage of .50-caliber ammunition in the Far East Air Force, placing a strain on the engines of all the aircraft since no replacement engines were available. In October 1941, the P-35s were earmarked for transfer to the Philippine Army Air Corps after sufficient Curtiss P-40 Warhawks were received by the FEAF.

In November 1941, after the 3rd and 17th PS received new P-40E aircraft, most of their P-35As were passed to two newly arrived squadrons attached to the group, the 21st and 34th PS, with the latter receiving most. The 21st PS received its P-40Es on the eve of war and transferred its few P-35s to the 34th Pursuit Squadron, which then had nearly a full squadron. It then fought with them in the futile defense of the islands in December 1941, initially at Del Carmen Airfield. They were hopelessly outclassed by the Japanese fighters. Lack of armor and self-sealing fuel tanks made the aircraft extremely vulnerable (12 P-35As were destroyed and six damaged by a Japanese strafing attack on Del Carmen Airfield on 10 December) and by 12 December 1941, only eight P-35As were still in flying condition. However, also on 10 December 1941, a P-35A of the 34th Pursuit Squadron piloted by 1st Lt. Samuel H. Marrett is credited with the sinking of Japanese minesweeper W-10 during the Japanese invasion of Vigan in northern Luzon. Marrett made multiple strafing runs against &quot;W-10&quot;, until the ship blew up. The explosion was so powerful it tore a wing off of Marrett&#x27;s P-35, causing him to crash into the sea.
In late December 1941, most of the remaining strength of the Army Air Force in the Philippines was evacuated to airfields on the Bataan Peninsula. On 2 January 1942, five surviving P-35As attempted to fly from Pilar Field to Bataan Airfield, but two were hit by anti-aircraft fire, with one crashing and the second returning to Pilar where it was wrecked on landing. On 11 January, the two remaining P-35s evacuated to Del Monte Airfield on Mindanao, carrying several unit personnel in their baggage compartments. On 4 April, they returned briefly to Bataan to evacuate other personnel, and one was lost crash-landing on Cebu on 10 April. The sole surviving P-35 was turned over to Capt. Ramon Zosa of the PAAC on 30 April, and flew its last sortie out of Del Monte Airfield, accompanying a P-40 on a strafing attack of Japanese landings at Macajalar Bay on 3 May 1942.

===Sweden===
The Swedish Air Force received 60 J 9s in the spring-summer 1940. The aircraft were operated alongside other units assigned to the Svea Air Force Wing (F 8) protecting Stockholm, replacing the obsolete Gloster Gladiators. Swedish J 9s served with Flygvapnet as a fighter until 1946. Later, 10 aircraft were equipped with cameras but retained their J 9 fighter designation and, in addition, a number of others were used for liaison and general flight training. The last seven J 9 aircraft remained in service until September 1952.

Writing mainly in Urdu, he produced 22 collections of short stories, a novel, five series of radio plays, three collections of essays and two collections of personal sketches. His best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. He is best known for his stories about the partition of India, which he opposed, immediately following independence in 1947. Manto&#x27;s most notable work has been archived by Rekhta.

Manto was tried six times for alleged obscenity in his writings; thrice before 1947 in British India, and thrice after independence in 1947 in Pakistan, but was never convicted. He is acknowledged as one of the finest 20th-century Urdu writers and is the subject of two biographical films: the 2015 film &quot;Manto&quot;, directed by Sarmad Khoosat and the 2018 film &quot;Manto&quot;, directed by Nandita Das.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Saadat Hassan Manto was born in Paproudi village of Samrala, in the Ludhiana district of the Punjab in a Muslim family of barristers on 11 May 1912. He belonged to a Kashmiri trading family that had settled in Amritsar in the early nineteenth century and taken up the legal profession. His father, Khwaja Ghulam Hasan, was a session judge of a local court. His mother, Sardar Begum had a Pathan ancestry and was the second wife of his father. Ethnically a Kashmiri he was proud of his roots. In a letter to Pandit Nehru he suggested that being &#x27;beautiful&#x27; was the second meaning of being &#x27;Kashmiri&#x27;.

===Education and early career===
He received his early education at a Muslim High School at Amritsar where he twice failed his matriculation examination. In 1931 he took admission at the Hindu Sabha College but dropped out after first year due to poor results.

The big turning point in his life came in 1933, at age 21, when he met Abdul Bari Alig, a scholar and polemic writer who encouraged him to find his true talents and read Russian and French authors. Bari also encouraged Manto to translate Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;The Last Day of a Condemned Man&quot; into Urdu which was later published by Urdu Book Stall, Lahore as &quot;Sarguzasht-e-Aseer&quot; (A Prisoner&#x27;s Story). He then translated Oscar Wilde’s &quot;Vera&quot; into Urdu in 1934. He published his first original story in Urdu, &quot;Tamasha&quot; (Spectacle) under a pseudonym in Abdul Bari Alig&#x27;s Urdu newspaper &quot;Khalq&quot; (Creation). It was based on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. During this period he contributed to the daily newspaper &quot;Musawat&quot;, (Equality) and &quot;Ehsan&quot; (Kindness), both published from Amritsar. He also edited and translated Russian and French stories for the journals &quot;Alamgir&quot; and &quot;Humayun&quot;. On Bari&#x27;s encouragement these Russian stories were then published in Lahore under the title, &quot;Rusi Afsanay&quot; (Russian Stories). The collection included stories from Tolstoy, Gorky and Chekhov and two of Manto&#x27;s original stories, &quot;Tamasha&quot; (Spectacle) and &quot;Mahigir&quot; (Fisherman).

This heightened enthusiasm pushed Manto to pursue graduation at Aligarh Muslim University, which he joined in July 1934, and soon got associated with the literary circle who would later become members of the Indian Progressive Writers&#x27; Association (IPWA). It was here that he met writer Ali Sardar Jafri and found a new spurt in his writing. His second story, &quot;Inqlaab Pasand&quot;, was published in Aligarh magazine in March 1935. His education at Aligarh was cut short when nine months into joining the university he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He spent the next three months at a sanatorium at Batote in Kashmir to regain his health and then returned home to Amritsar.

After a brief stay in Amritsar, Manto moved to Lahore in search of employment and joined the newspaper &quot;Paras&quot; (Philosopher&#x27;s Stone). In 1936, at Lahore, he published his first collection of original short stories &quot;Atish Paray&quot; (Nuggets of Fire).

In late 1936, he moved to Bombay when he received an invitation to edit the weekly &quot;Mussawir&quot; (Painter).

===Career in Bombay (1937-1941)===
In Bombay, Manto started his work as an editor of &quot;Mussawir&quot; along with Nazir Ludhianvi and the magazine &quot;Samaj&quot; (Society). He also started to write dialogues and scripts for the Hindi film industry, working first for the Imperial Film Company and then for Saroj Movietone. His films during this period include the 1940 film &quot;Apni Nagariya&quot;. He wrote many radio plays including &quot;Ao Radio Sunen&quot; (Come, Let&#x27;s Listen to Radio) and &quot;Qalopatrah ki maut&quot; (Cleopatra&#x27;s Death). In Bombay, he also came in contact with Progressive Writers&#x27; Association and became friendly with progressive writers like Krishan Chander, Rajinder Singh Bedi and Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi.

In 1940 he published his second collection of short stories &quot;Manto Ke Afsanay&quot; (Stories of Manto) from Lahore.

In August 1940 he was dismissed from the editorship of &quot;Musawwir&quot; and started working for another magazine called &quot;Karwan&quot; (Caravan) at a lower salary. Dissatisfied in his work, he applied to Krishan Chander for a job with All India Radio in Delhi. Subsequently he moved to Delhi in January 1941 and accepted the job of writing for Urdu Service of All India Radio.

===In Delhi (1941-1942)===
Manto joined All India Radio in early 1941 and became acquainted with many writers working there such as Chiragh Hasan Hasrat, Akhtar Hussain Raipuri, Ansar Nasiri, Mahmud Nizami, Meeraji and Upendranath Ashk.

This proved to be his most productive period as in the next eighteen months he published over four collections of radio plays, &quot;Aao&quot; (Come), &quot;Manto ke Drame&quot; (Manto&#x27;s Dramas), &quot;Janaze&quot; (Funerals) and &quot;Teen Auraten&quot; (Three women). He continued to write short stories and his next short story collection &quot;Dhuan&quot; (Smoke) was soon out followed by his first collection of topical essays, &quot;Manto ke Mazamin&quot;. This period culminated with the publication of his mixed collection &quot;Afsane aur Dramey&quot; in 1943. Meanwhile, due to growing differences with his colleagues at All India Radio, he left his job and returned to Bombay in July 1942 and again started working with the film industry.

===Return to Bombay (1942-1948)===
Manto returned to Bombay in July 1942 and rejoined as the editor of &quot;Musawwir&quot;. During this time, he associated with his Aligarh friend Shaheed Latif and his wife Ismat Chughtai. In 1932, on Latif&#x27;s invitation he joined the Filmistan studio. Here he also formed friendship with Ashok Kumar and entered his best phase in screenwriting giving films like &quot;Aatth Din&quot;, &quot;Chal Chal Re Naujawan&quot; and &quot;Mirza Ghalib&quot;, which was finally released in 1954. He also wrote &quot;Shikari&quot;. Some of his short stories also came from this phase including Kaali Shalwar (1941), Dhuan (1941) and Bu (1945), which was published in Qaumi Jang (Bombay) in February 1945. Another highlight of his second phase in Bombay was the publication of a collection of his stories, Chugad, which also included the story &#x27;Babu Gopinath&#x27;. Dissatisfied with the people at Filmistan, he joined the Bombay Talkies in 1947, after the partition of India.

=== Migration to Pakistan ===

As a resident of Bombay, Manto had intended to stay in India after partition. In 1948, his wife and children went to Lahore to visit their relatives and friends. During this time, as stories of the atrocities of partition riots reached him, in the midst of occasional communal riots in Bombay itself, he decided to migrate to Pakistan, and left for it by ship. He stayed a few days in Karachi, finally settling at Lahore with his family. Manto and his family thus found themselves as &quot;muhajirs&quot; (refugees from India) and were among the millions of Muslims who left present-day India for the new Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan.

=== Life in Lahore ===

When Manto arrived in Lahore from Bombay, he associated with several intellectuals at Lahore&#x27;s Pak Tea House. According to one commentator: &quot;There was absolutely no external influence and people would share their opinions on any subject without fear even during the military dictators&#x27; regimes.&quot; In Lahore, Manto lived with his wife and family in an apartment in Lakshmi Building located in Lahore&#x27;s famous Lakshmi Chowk (where many Film Distributors had offices) at the juncture of McLeod Road and Abbott Road. Lakshmi Building no longer exists as such but only its front or facade has been renovated and still faces McLeod Road. Lakshmi Building was abandoned during the partition riots of 1947-48 in Lahore. The mansion is currently dilapidated and uninhabited, though its façade still exists, renovated and painted.
 Later on, when Manto&#x27;s financial situation went from bad to worse, he and his family moved in with his wife Mrs. Safia Manto&#x27;s extended family. This was Manto&#x27;s extended family as well including his relatives Film Director Masud Pervaiz and Cricket Commentator Hamid Jalal. Manto, Safia Manto and their three daughters all lived with their extended family in a large apartment in the posh LAKSHMI MANSION, an Apartment Complex situated between Hall Road and Beadon Road which had a circular enclosed green space with a Peepal Tree where the other Apartment residents included Mani Shankar Ayyar and the renowned Lahore jeweller Girdhari Lal. The three storied building was built by Lala Lajpat Rai&#x27;s Lakshmi insurance company in 1938, inaugurated by Sarojini Naidu, and was at one time the residence of K.Santhanam, an eminent lawyer. Lakshmi Mansion still exists in Lahore and was never abandoned. Later residents have included a former Speaker of Pakistan&#x27;s National Assembly and Pakistan Peoples Party stalwart Malik Meraj Khalid.

=== Death ===

Manto had suffered public trials for writing obscene literature in the newly created and increasingly Islamized Pakistan. Sessions Judge Munir presided over Manto&#x27;s last trial in Lahore and he is the infamous judge who later became Justice Munir, Chief Justice of Pakistan Supreme Court and who invented the Doctrine of Necessity alias Nazria e Zaroorat in later years to buttress martial law in Pakistan. In this trial in Lahore against Manto, Faiz Ahmad Faiz, M.D. Taseer and many literary celebrities testified in favor of Manto. Manto&#x27;s trial ended with a warning from Sessions Judge Munir that he was being let off easy with just a fine but would be sent to jail for many years if he did not stop writing his provocative short stories. So, Manto could not write his novel and cutting edge short stories. Manto sank into depression. He tried to alleviate his depression with alcohol and this started affecting his liver and led to cirrhosis of liver with him vomiting blood. His wife and relatives tried admitting him into Lahore Mental Asylum on Jail Road, Lahore which was the rehab clinic for alcoholics at that time. This treatment did not work. Manto returned to Lakshami Mansions, Beadon Road near Mall Road. Soon he had become increasingly alcoholic, which eventually led to cirrhosis of the liver. He died on 18 January 1955, at Lakshami Mansions, Lahore. His death was attributed to the effects of alcoholism.

Manto is buried in Miani Saheb graveyard in Lahore. In 1954 he composed his own epitaph: Here lies Saadat Hasan Manto. With him lie buried all the arts and mysteries of short story writing . . . Under tons of earth he lies, wondering who of the two is the greater short story writer: God or he.

However, on the insistence of his family it was replaced by an alternative epitaph on his grave, which was also authored by him, inspired by a couplet from Ghalib:This is the grave of the grave of Saadat Hasan Manto, who still thinks his name was not the repeated word on the tablet of time.”

==Personal life==
On 26 April 1939, Manto married Safia Begum. Their first child Arif died at a young age in April 1941 in Delhi. Later they had three daughters Nighat Manto, Nuzhat Manto and Nusrat Manto. His daughter Nighat Bashir still lives at Lakshami Mansions, Beadon Road where Manto breathed his last.

==Writings==
Manto chronicled the chaos that prevailed, during and after the Partition of India in 1947. Manto strongly opposed the partition of India, which he saw as an &quot;overwhelming tragedy&quot; and &quot;maddeningly senseless&quot;. He started his literary career translating the works of Victor Hugo, Oscar Wilde and Russian writers such as Chekhov and Gorky. His first story was &quot;Tamasha&quot;, based on the Jallianwala Bagh massacre at Amritsar. Though his earlier works, influenced by the progressive writers of his times, showed a marked leftist and socialist leanings, his later work progressively became stark in portraying the darkness of the human psyche, as humanist values progressively declined around the Partition.

His final works, which grew from the social climate and his own financial struggles, reflected an innate sense of human impotency towards darkness and contained satire that verged on dark comedy, as seen in his final work, Toba Tek Singh. It not only showed the influence of his own demons, but also that of the collective madness that he saw in the ensuing decade of his life. To add to it, his numerous court cases and societal rebukes deepened his cynical view of society, from which he felt isolated.
No part of human existence remained untouched or taboo for him, he sincerely brought out stories of prostitutes and pimps alike, just as he highlighted the subversive sexual slavery of the women of his times. To many contemporary women writers, his language portrayed reality and provided them with the dignity they long deserved. He is still known for his scathing insight into human behaviour as well as revelation of the macabre animalistic nature of the enraged people, that stands out amidst the brevity of his prose.

At least one commentator compares Saadat Hasan Manto to D. H. Lawrence, partly because he wrote about taboos of Indo-Pakistani Society. His concerns on the socio-political issues, from local to global are revealed in his series, Letters to Uncle Sam, and those to Pandit Nehru. On his writing he often commented, &quot;If you find my stories dirty, the society you are living in is dirty. With my stories, I only expose the truth&quot;.

== Controversies ==
=== Conservative critique: charge for obscenity ===
Manto faced trial for obscenity in his writings, three times in British India before 1947 (‘Dhuan’, ‘Bu’ and ‘Kali Shalwar’) and three times in Pakistan after 1947 (‘Khol Do’, ‘Thanda Gosht’ and ‘Upar Neeche Darmiyaan’) under section 292 of the &quot;Indian Penal Code &quot; (by the British Government) and the &quot;Pakistan Penal Code &quot;in Pakistan&#x27;s early years. He was fined only in one case. Regarding the charges of obscenity he opined, &quot;I am not a pornographer but a story writer&quot;.

=== Progressive critique: migration to Pakistan ===
While the conservative or right-wing section of the society criticised him on moral grounds, the progressives or Marxists and leftists criticised him for ideological reasons, namely for his migration to Pakistan and embrace of Pakistani nationalism, Manto then being championed by traditional minded literary critics such as Hasan Askari and Mumtaz Shirin.

==Legacy==

=== Awards ===
On 14 August 2012 which is Pakistan&#x27;s Independence Day, Saadat Hasan Manto was posthumously awarded the Nishan-e-Imtiaz award (Distinguished Service to Pakistan Award) by the Government of Pakistan.

=== Film, theatre, and literature ===
Manto was a writer whose life story became a subject of intense discussion and introspection. During the last two decades, many stage productions were done to present his character in conflict with the harsh socio-economic realities of the post-partition era. Danish Iqbal&#x27;s stage Play &quot;Ek Kutte Ki Kahani&quot; presented Manto in a new perspective on occasion of his birth centenary.

In 2015, Pakistani actor and director Sarmad Khoosat made and released a movie, &quot;Manto&quot;, based on the life of Manto. In 2018, the British Broadcasting Corporation named the work Toba Tek Singh among the 100 stories that shaped the world, alongside works by authors like Homer and Virginia Woolf.

The 2018 film &quot;Manto&quot;, made by Nandita Das and starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui, is a Bollywood film based on the life of Manto.

=== Other Media ===
On 18 January 2005, the fiftieth anniversary of his death, Manto was commemorated on a Pakistani postage stamp. 

On 11 May 2020, Google celebrated his 108th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="675172" wikidata="Q451727" url="?curid=675172" title="Charles Bell">
<text>Sir Charles Bell (12 November 177428 April 1842) was a Scottish surgeon, anatomist, physiologist, neurologist, artist, and philosophical theologian. He is noted for discovering the difference between sensory nerves and motor nerves in the spinal cord. He is also noted for describing Bell&#x27;s palsy.

His three older brothers included Robert Bell (1757–1816) a Writer to the Signet, John Bell (1763–1820), also a noted surgeon and writer; and the advocate George Joseph Bell (1770–1843) who became a professor of law at the University of Edinburgh and a principal clerk at the Court of Session.

==Early life and education==

Charles Bell was born in Edinburgh on 12 November 1774, as the fourth son of the Reverend William Bell, a clergyman of the Episcopal Church of Scotland. Charles&#x27;s father died in 1779 when he was five years old, so his mother had a unique influence on his early life, teaching him how to read and write. In addition to this, his mother also helped Charles&#x27;s natural artistic ability by paying for his regular drawing and painting lessons from David Allan, a well-known Scottish painter. Charles Bell grew up in Edinburgh, and attended the prestigious High School (1784–88). Although he was not a particularly good student, Charles decided to follow in his brother John&#x27;s footsteps and enter a medical career. In 1792, Charles Bell enrolled at the University of Edinburgh and began assisting his brother John as a surgical apprentice. While at the university, Bell attended the lectures of Dugald Stewart on spiritual philosophy. These lectures had a considerable impact on Bell, for some of Stewart&#x27;s teachings can be traced in Bell&#x27;s later works in a passage on his &quot;Treatise on the Hand&quot;. In addition to classes on anatomy, Bell took a course on the art of drawing to refine his artistic skill. At the university he was also a member of the Royal Medical Society as a student and spoke at the Society&#x27;s centenary celebrations in 1837.

In 1798, Bell graduated from the University of Edinburgh and soon after was admitted to the Edinburgh College of Surgeons where he taught anatomy and operated at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. While developing his talents as a surgeon, Bell&#x27;s interests forayed into a field combining anatomy and art. His inherent talent as an artist came to the fore when he helped his brother complete a four-volume work called &quot;The Anatomy of the Human Body&quot;. Charles Bell completely wrote and illustrated volumes 3 and 4 in 1803 and published his own set of illustrations in a &quot;System of Dissections&quot; in 1798 and 1799. Furthermore, Bell used his clinical experience and artistic eye to develop the hobby of modeling interesting medical cases in wax. He proceeded to accumulate an extensive collection that he dubbed his Museum of Anatomy, some items of which can still be seen today at Surgeon&#x27;s Hall.

Charles Bell&#x27;s stay in Edinburgh did not last long due to an infamous feud between John Bell and two faculty members at the University of Edinburgh: Alexander Monro Secundus and John Gregory. John Gregory was the chairman of the Royal Infirmary and had declared that only six full-time surgical staff members would be appointed to work at the infirmary. The Bell brothers were not selected and thus barred from practicing medicine at the Royal Infirmary. Charles Bell, who was not directly involved in his brother&#x27;s feuds, attempted to make a deal with the faculty of the University of Edinburgh by offering the university one hundred guineas and his Museum of Anatomy in exchange for allowing him to observe and sketch the operations performed at the Royal Infirmary, but this deal was rejected.

== Professional career ==
In 1804, Charles Bell left for London and in 1805 had established himself in the city by buying a house on Leicester Street. From this house Bell taught classes in anatomy and surgery for medical students, doctors, and artists. In 1809, Bell was among a number of civilian surgeons who volunteered to attend to the many thousands of ill and wounded soldiers who had retreated to Corunna, and 6 years later he again voluntarily attended to the ill and wounded in the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo. Regrettably, of Bell&#x27;s 12 amputation cases, only one man survived. In addition to the amputation surgeries, Bell was quite fascinated by musket-ball injuries and in 1814, he published a &quot;Dissertation on Gunshot Wounds&quot;. A number of his illustrations of the wounds are displayed in the hall of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh.

In 1811, Charles Bell married Marion Shaw. Using money from his wife&#x27;s dowry, Bell purchased a share of the Great Windmill Street School of Anatomy which had been founded by the anatomist William Hunter. Bell transferred his practice from his house to the Windmill Street School Bell ended up teaching students and conducting his own research until 1824. In 1813–14, he was appointed as a member of the London College of Surgeons and as a surgeon at the Middlesex Hospital.

In addition to his domestic pursuits, Bell also served as a military surgeon, making elaborate recordings of neurological injuries at the Royal Hospital Haslar and famously documenting his experiences at Waterloo in 1815. For three consecutive days and nights, he operated on French soldiers in the Gens d&#x27;Armerie Hospital. The condition of the French soldiers was quite poor, and thus many of his patients died shortly after he operated on them. Dr Robert Knox, who was one of Bell&#x27;s surgical assistants at Brussels, was critical of Bell&#x27;s surgical skills and commented rather negatively on Bell&#x27;s surgical abilities; (the mortality rate of amputations carried out by Bell ran at about 90%).

Bell was instrumental in the creation of the Middlesex Hospital Medical School, and became, in 1824, the first professor of Anatomy and Surgery of the College of Surgeons in London. In that same year Bell sold his collection of over 3,000 wax preparations to the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh for £3000.

In 1829, the Windmill Street School of Anatomy was incorporated into the new King&#x27;s College London. Bell was invited to be its first professor of physiology, and helped establish the Medical School at the University of London, gave the inaugural address when it formally opened, and even helped contribute to the requirements of its certification program. Bell&#x27;s stay at the Medical School did not last long and he resigned from his chair due to differences of opinion with the academic staff. For the next seven years, Bell gave clinical lectures at the Middlesex Hospital and in 1835 he accepted the position of the Chair of Surgery at the University of Edinburgh following the premature death of Prof John William Turner.

He was made a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1833.

Bell died at Hallow Park near Worcester in the Midlands, while travelling from Edinburgh to London, in 1842.

He is buried in Hallow Churchyard near Worcester.

==Honours and awards==
Bell was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 8 June 1807, on the nomination of Robert Jameson, William Wright and Thomas Macknight. He served as a Councillor of the RSE from 1836 to 1839.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London on 16 November 1826, and awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s gold medal for his numerous discoveries in science. Bell was knighted into the Guelphic Order of Hanover in 1831. Like Sir Richard Owen, he was also elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==Works==

Charles Bell was a prolific author who combined his anatomical knowledge with his artistic eye to produce a number of highly detailed and beautifully illustrated books. In 1799, Bell published his first work &quot;&quot;A System of Dissections, explaining the Anatomy of the Human Body, the manner of displaying Parts and their Varieties in Disease&quot;. His second work was the completion of his brother&#x27;s four-volume set of &quot;The Anatomy of the Human Body&quot; in 1803. In that same year, Bell published his three series of engravings titled &quot;Engravings of the Arteries&quot;, &quot;Engravings of the Brain&quot;, and &quot;Engravings of the Nerves&quot;.&quot; These sets of engravings consisted of intricate and detailed anatomical diagrams accompanied with labels and a brief description of their functionality in the human body and were published as an educational tool for aspiring medical students. The &quot;Engravings of the Brain&quot; are of particular importance for this marked Bell&#x27;s first published attempt at fully elucidating the organization of the nervous system. In his introduction to the work, Bell comments on the ambiguous nature of the brain and its inner workings, a topic that would hold his interest for the remainder of his life.

In 1806, with his eye on a teaching post at the Royal Academy, Bell published his &quot;Essays on The Anatomy of Expression in Painting&quot; (1806), later re-published as &quot;Essays on The Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression&quot; in 1824. In this work, Bell followed the principles of natural theology, asserting the existence of a uniquely human system of facial muscles in the service of a human species with a unique relationship to the Creator, ideals which paralleled with those of William Paley. After the failure of his application (Sir Thomas Lawrence, later President of the Royal Academy, described Bell as &quot;lacking in temper, modesty and judgement&quot;), Bell turned his attentions to the nervous system.

Bell published detailed studies of the nervous system in 1811, in his privately circulated book &quot;An Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain&quot;. In this book, Bell described his idea of the different nervous tracts connecting with different parts of brain and thus leading to different functionality. His experiments to investigate this consisted of cutting open the spinal cord of a rabbit and touching different columns of the cord. He found that an irritation of the anterior columns led to a convulsion of the muscles, while an irritation of the posterior columns had no visible effect. These experiments led Bell to declare that he was the first to distinguish between sensory and motor nerves. While this essay is considered by many to be the founding stone of clinical neurology, it was not well received by Bell&#x27;s peers. His experimentation was criticized and the idea that he presented of the anterior and posterior roots being connected to the cerebrum and cerebellum respectively, was rejected. Furthermore, Bell&#x27;s &quot;original&quot; essay of 1811 did not actually contain a clear description of motor and sensory nerve roots as Bell later claimed, and he seems to have issued subsequent incorrectly dated revisions with subtle textual alterations.

Despite this lukewarm response, Charles Bell continued to study the anatomy of the human brain and laid his focus upon the nerves connected to it. In 1821, Bell published the &quot;On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some Experiments on Their Structure and Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System&quot; in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. This paper held Bell&#x27;s most famous discovery, that the facial nerve or seventh cranial nerve is a nerve of muscular action. This was quite an important discovery because surgeons would often cut this nerve as an attempted cure for facial neuralgia, but this would often render the patient with a unilateral paralysis of the facial muscles, now known as Bell&#x27;s Palsy. Due to this publication, Charles Bell is regarded as one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with clinical practice.

Bell&#x27;s studies on emotional expression played a catalytic role in the development of Darwin&#x27;s considerations of the origins of human emotional life; and, while he rejected Bell&#x27;s theological arguments, Darwin very much agreed with Bell&#x27;s emphasis on the expressive role of the muscles of respiration. Darwin detailed these opinions in his &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot; (1872), written with the active collaboration of the psychiatrist James Crichton-Browne. 
Bell was one of the first physicians to combine the scientific study of neuroanatomy with clinical practice. In 1821, he described in the trajectory of the facial nerve and a disease, Bell&#x27;s Palsy which led to the unilateral paralysis of facial muscles, in one of the classics of neurology, a paper delivered to the Royal Society entitled &quot;On the Nerves: Giving an Account of some Experiments on Their Structure and Functions, Which Lead to a New Arrangement of the System.&quot;

Bell also combined his many artistic, scientific, literary and teaching talents in a number of wax preparations and detailed anatomical and surgical illustrations, paintings and engravings in his several books on these subjects, such as in his book &quot;Illustrations of the Great Operations of Surgery: Trepan, Hernia, Amputation, Aneurism, and Lithotomy&quot; (1821). He wrote also the first treatise on notions of anatomy and physiology of facial expression for painters and illustrators, titled &quot;Essays on the Anatomy of Expression in Painting&quot; (1806).

In 1829, Francis Egerton, the eighth Earl of Bridgewater, died and in his will, he left a large sum of money to the President of the Royal Society of London. The will stipulated that the money was to be used to write, print, and publish one thousand copies of a work on the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God. The President of the Royal Society, Davies Gilbert appointed eight gentlemen to write separate treatises on the subject. In 1833, he published the fourth Bridgewater Treatise, &quot;The Hand: Its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as Evincing Design&quot;. Charles Bell published four editions of &quot;The Hand&quot;. In the first few chapters, Bell organizes his treatise as an early textbook of comparative anatomy. The book is full of pictures where Bell compares &quot;hands&quot; of different organisms ranging from human hands, chimpanzee paws, and fish feelers. After the first few chapters, Bell orients his treatise around the significance of the hand and its importance in its use in anatomy. He emphasizes that the hand is as important as the eye in the field of surgery and that it must be trained.

==Legacy==
A number of discoveries received his name:
* Bell&#x27;s (external respiratory) nerve: The long thoracic nerve.
* Bell&#x27;s palsy: a unilateral idiopathic paralysis of facial muscles due to a lesion of the facial nerve.
* Bell&#x27;s phenomenon: A normal defense mechanism—upward and outward movement of the eye which occurs when an individual closes their eyes forcibly. It can be appreciated clinically in a patient with paralysis of the orbicularis oculi (e.g. Guillain–Barré syndrome or Bell&#x27;s palsy), as the eyelid remains elevated when the patient tries to close the eye.
* Bell&#x27;s spasm: Involuntary twitching of the facial muscles.
* Bell–Magendie law or Bell&#x27;s Law: States that the anterior branch of spinal nerve roots contain only motor fibers and the posterior roots contain only sensory fibers.

Charles Bell House, part of University College London, is used for teaching and research in surgery.
