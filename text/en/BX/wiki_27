<text>was a Japanese general who served during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. He was the commanding general of the 32nd Army, which fought in the Battle of Okinawa during the final stages of the war. Ushijima&#x27;s troops were defeated, and at the end of the battle he committed suicide.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Ushijima was born in Kagoshima city, where his father had been a samurai in the service of Satsuma Domain and later a career officer in the early Imperial Japanese Army. He was the fourth son, and one of his elder brothers served as governor of Ibaraki Prefecture. The family relocated to Tokyo, but when his father died shortly after Ushijima was born, his mother moved the family back to Kagoshima. He graduated from school with honors and decided to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps for a military career. Ushijima graduated from the 20th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1908 with honors, and was noted for his mastery of the &quot;Jigen-ryū&quot; school of Japanese swordsmanship. He graduated from the 28th class of the Army Staff College in 1916, where his classmates included Tomoyuki Yamashita and Shizuichi Tanaka.

In August 1918, Ushijima was assigned to the staff of the Japanese Expeditionary Force based at Vladivostok during the Siberian Intervention against Bolshevik forces during the Russian Civil War, where his duty was to coordinate the dispatch of troops and to arrange transportation of supplies. He was promoted to captain later that year. On his return to Japan, he was awarded the Order of the Golden Kite, 5th class.

In April 1919, Ushijima served as commander of the 4th Guards Regiment and became an instructor at the Army Infantry School in August 1920. When he was promoted to major in 1924, he took command of the IJA 43rd Infantry Battalion. In April 1925, he was assigned to his alma mater, Daiichi Kagoshima Junior High School as part of an experiment conducted by the Minister of the Army, Kazunari Ugaki to provide basic military education to students at universities, junior high schools, and normal schools nationwide. Ushijima stayed in this position for three years.　

In 1928, Ushijima was promoted to lieutenant colonel and commander of the IJA 23rd Infantry Regiment. In 1930, he became chief-of-staff of Shimonoseki Fortress, and in 1932 became commandant of the elite Army&#x27;s Toyama School, and was promoted to colonel. Around this time, young officers were increasingly influenced by the ultra right-wing writings of Kita Ikki, often talked about politics, but Ushijima strongly instructed instructors and students to concentrate on military service and publicly denounced Kita Ikka.

From 1933 to 1936, Ushijima served in administrative postings within the Army Ministry. During this time, political factionalism within the army was at its worst and Ushijima strove to avoid association with any faction. At the time of the February 26 incident in 1936, he was away in China on a business trip, and returned only after the rebellion was suppressed. However, he was selected to command the disgraced IJA 1st Infantry Regiment, which was sent to northern Manchukuo as punishment for its role in the uprising.

===World War II===

With the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ushijima was promoted to major general and appointed commander of the IJA 36th Infantry Brigade, which consisted of the Miyakonojō-based IJA 23rd Infantry Regiment and the Kagoshima-based IJA 45th Infantry Regiment. The 36th Brigade departed Kagoshima in early August 1937 and took up positions at the Shanhai Pass in northern China.

He was ordered by General Hisao Tani of the IJA 6th Division to advance and destroy the three divisions of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s elite Chinese 14th Army, which were threatening Japanese positions near Badaling. Although greatly outnumbered, Ushijima fought a series of battles from August 30 through September 13, breaking through the Chinese lines, and reaching the outskirts of Shijiazhuang by October 14, albeit with heavy casualties. Ushijima was noted for leading from the front lines, regardless of the personal risk.

The IJA 36th Brigade then assisted in breaking the deadlock in Shanghai and captured a large number of Chinese soldiers and their weapons fleeing the city for Nanjing. In December, the brigade captured Wuhu, where it overwintered. From July 1938, the brigade participated in the Battle of Wuhan.

In March 1939, he was ordered back to Japan and was promoted to lieutenant general in August. In December, he was given command of the IJA 11th Division and assigned to garrison duty in Hulin, Manchukuo, on the Soviet border. he returned to Japan in October 1941 as Commandant of the Non-Commissioned Officers Academy.

The attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941 caught Ushijima by surprise and he was vocal in his opposition to war with the United States, which he felt would only prolong the war in China and would weaken Japan against what he perceived to be Japan&#x27;s true enemy, the Soviet Union. He was removed from his position in April 1942 for fear that he would influence his students and subordinates with ideas contrary to official government policy. However, Ushijima was reinstated instead as commandant of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, largely at the recommendation of Kenji Doihara and Otozō Yamada, who shared his misgivings about the Pacific War. Ushijima felt that students at the Army Academy had become arrogant and &quot;drunk with a sense of victory&quot; after the fall of Singapore, and warned his students that the abundant natural resources and industrial capacity of the United States should not be underestimated.

Ushijima&#x27;s warnings were prophetic, and despite his stated desire to remain an educator, he was ordered to take command of the newly formed 120,000 man 32nd Army, charged with the defense of the Ryukyu Islands against American invasion.

His predecessor, Masao Watanabe, had begun to implement a plan to evacuate the civilian population of Okinawa to mainland Japan or Taiwan. Ushijima&#x27;s arrival with a large number of reinforcements made the evacuation more difficult as many civilians gained a false sense of security, while the &quot;Tsushima Maru&quot; incident, in which over 1600 civilians, many of them children, perished on an evacuation vessel sunk by an American submarine, caused a panic. Nevertheless, Ushijima managed to evacuate 80,000 people from Okinawa and about 30,000 people from the Yaeyama Islands prior to the American invasion.

However, he was less successful in his efforts to evacuate the remainder of the civilian population to the largely uninhabited northern half of the island due to lack of food supplies, malaria, and the need to conscript many able-bodied civilians to assist in the construction of trenches, bunkers and other defensive works, including his command headquarters in a network of tunnels under Shuri Castle in Naha. Ushijima was promoted to full general on June 20.

Ushijima led a skillful defense of the island based on a defense in depth as planned by his chief of staff, Colonel Hiromichi Yahara; however, he was constantly undermined by insubordination by his second in command, General Isamu Cho, who was pursuing a more aggressive policy encouraged by the Army General Staff in Tokyo for mass attacks against the invading American forces. After an offensive action urged by Cho led to a near massacre of the attacking Japanese troops by superior American firepower, and the turning of the Shuri Line by the American forces, he led a successful withdrawal of his troops to the extreme south of the island.

This defensive line lacked the carefully prepared underground defenses of the Shuri Line, and became a fragmented grouping of isolated defensive positions. Ushijima and Cho retreated to Hill 89 at the south coast. The command and control of the remnants of the 32nd Army soon quickly deteriorated as communication with the last defensive positions was cut. Record numbers of Japanese prisoners surrendered; many were Okinawan volunteers or conscripts.

Ushijima refused a plea via leaflets dropped on Japanese positions on the 11 June from the American General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. to surrender.

===Death===
By middle June the 32nd Army was effectively reduced to occupying two strongpoints, one beneath Kunishi Ridge and the other, the command headquarters inside Hill 89.

Realizing that the end of the battle was fast approaching Ushijima pledged in a farewell message to the Imperial headquarters that he would direct a final last stand “in which I will apologize to the emperor with my own death.”
On the 18 June he directed his troops to make their way in small groups through enemy lines and join guerrilla groups in northern Okinawa. He then followed it with his final order:
 “My beloved Soldiers;
You have fought courageously for nearly three months. You have discharged your duty. Your bravery and loyalty brighten the future.

The battlefield is now in such chaos that all communications have ceased. It is impossible for me to command you. Every man in these fortifications will follow his superior officer’s order and fight to the end for the sake of the motherland.

This is my final order.

Farewell”
General Cho added a postscript on the order, in red ink ”Do not suffer the shame of being taken prisoner. You will live for eternity.”

Ushijima and Cho had decided to commit Seppuku (ritual suicide) and on the night of their planned departure held a banquet in the cave housing the command post with a large meal prepared by Ushijima&#x27;s cook, Tetsuo Nakamutam, which was complemented with plenty of sake and Cho&#x27;s remaining stock of captured Black &amp; White Scotch whisky.

Later in the early hours of 22 June the staff in the command post lined up to pay their respects to Ushijima who was attired in his full dress uniform and Cho who wore a white kimono. Cho volunteered to go first and lead the way, &quot;as the way may be dark,” but Ushijima insisted on going first. The men made their way onto an outside ledge overlooking the ocean, on which a white cloth had been laid over a quilt. Handed a knife by an aide Ushijima shouted and made a deep vertical cut in his bared abdomen before Captain Sakaguchi (who was regarded as a master swordsman) decapitated him with his sword. Cho followed Ushijima and the bodies of both men were buried by three orderlies in shallow graves.

Their deaths were witnessed by Yahara, who was the most senior officer captured by American forces. Yahara had asked Ushijima for permission to commit suicide, but the general refused his request, saying, &quot;If you die there will be no one left who knows the truth about the battle of Okinawa. Bear the temporary shame but endure it. This is an order from your army commander.&quot; Yahara later authored a book entitled &quot;The Battle for Okinawa&quot;, describing Ushijima&#x27;s last moments.

The bodies of Ushijima, and Cho, were buried under U.S. military auspices on 27 June 1945 near the cave where they died in the last hours of fighting on Okinawa. &quot;The bodies of the two Japanese generals were lowered into graves almost above their cave headquarters which was sealed during the American flag service.&quot;

Ushijima was described as a humane man who discouraged his senior officers from striking his subordinates and who disliked displays of anger because he considered it a base emotion. American historian Hanson W. Baldwin regarded Ushijima as the greatest Japanese general of the Pacific War.

<text>El Sendero Luminoso is the name of a big wall climbing bolted route at El Potrero Chico, Nuevo León, Mexico that rises over 1500 ft (~450 m) up the front side of El Toro mountain. It is one of the hardest big wall routes in the area and 11 of its 15 pitches are graded at over . The route was established by Jeff Jackson, Kurt Smith, and Pete Peacock and is graded 5.12+ V overall.

On January 15, 2014, Alex Honnold became the first person to free solo the route, taking just over three hours. On November 27, 2019, the American rock climber Brad Gobright fell approximately 300 meters to his death while descending from the route with his climbing partner, Aidan Jacobson, who fell between 20 and 30 meters but survived.

<doc id="667010" wikidata="Q3367104" url="?curid=667010" title="Genesis of the Daleks">
<text>Genesis of the Daleks is the fourth serial of the twelfth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was written by Terry Nation and directed by David Maloney, and originally broadcast in six weekly parts from 8 March to 12 April 1975 on BBC1. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Fourth Doctor and his human travelling companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan are directed by the Time Lords to the planet Skaro at the time of the Daleks&#x27; creation to prevent them from becoming the dominant race in the universe.

It was originally commissioned under producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks, who believed that the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures, and encouraged him to explore the origin of the Daleks. The story introduces the Daleks&#x27; creator Davros, who had a unique visual design. The script was handed to Letts and Dicks&#x27; successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone. Nation, having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis, further explored the theme in &quot;Genesis&quot;. It also addresses the moral issues that come with time travel and genocide.

The story was filmed over January and February 1975, with some location filming in a quarry in Betchworth. &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; premiered with 10.7 million viewers and concluded five weeks later with 9.1 million, with the least-watched episode being Part Three with 8.5 million viewers. Since its broadcast it has been widely praised as one of the series&#x27; best.

==Plot==
The Doctor and his companions are intercepted by the Time Lords, who instruct the Doctor to interfere with the creation of the Daleks; and given a Time Ring to return them to his TARDIS when the mission is complete.

The three find themselves on the planet of Skaro. A generations-long war between the Thals and the Kaleds has left the planet inhospitable; except for their two domes. An attack separates them; Sarah meets the Mutos, mutated exiles of both sides, but then are all captured by the Thals. The Doctor and Harry are captured by the Kaleds, their possessions confiscated, and are taken to a bunker to meet the scientific and military elite, including the lead scientist Davros, who unveils the &quot;Mark III travel machine&quot;, or &quot;Dalek&quot;. Ronson, one of the scientists, secretly tells the Doctor that Davros&#x27; experiments are unethical, and the Doctor convinces the leadership to halt them. Learning of Ronson&#x27;s actions, Davros covertly provides the Thal leaders a chemical formula that can weaken the Kaled dome.

The Doctor and Harry reach the Thal dome and rescue Sarah. A missile strikes the Kaled dome, killing all those not in the bunker; it is revealed that Davros gave the details to the Thals so that he could dispose of those Kaleds who opposed him. Davros accuses Ronson of being the traitor, orders the Daleks to kill him, and convinces the leadership to have his Daleks attack the Thals. The attack kills many Thals; the Doctor, his companions, and the survivors make their way to the bunker and the Doctor instructs them to find a way to destroy it while he and his companions go inside.

Davros captures the Doctor; the other scientists, now aware of his plans, free the Doctor, who then rigs the Dalek incubation room with explosives. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, he hesitates, questioning whether he has the right to make that decision.

He is relieved to learn that Davros has agreed to allow a vote on the project. The Doctor recovers the Time Ring; as the vote is called, the Daleks return and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape, while the Doctor returns to set off the explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes before the Thal and Mutos&#x27; bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks, who then refuse to take orders from a non-Dalek, and seemingly exterminate Davros. While he suspects he has only managed to set back Dalek evolution somewhat, the Doctor considers his mission complete: out of the Daleks&#x27; evil, good will always arise to challenge them. He and his companions say goodbye to the survivors and use the Time Ring to return to the TARDIS.

===Conception and writing===
When planning stories for season 12, producer Barry Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks felt that it was time for Terry Nation to return to the series and write another Dalek adventure. Letts and Dicks enjoyed the script Nation sent in, but found it too &quot;reminiscent&quot; of many of his previous Dalek stories. The two suggested that Nation instead write an origin story for the Daleks, originally titled &quot;Daleks – Genesis of Terror&quot;. The serial was commissioned on 1 April 1974, and the scripts accepted on 22 July. The stories lined up for the season were handed over to Letts and Dicks&#x27; successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and script editor Robert Holmes, with whom &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; gained a darker tone. Holmes was not a fan of frequent appearances by the Daleks, and only allowed the story because it explored their origins. In an aim to make the series more adult, Hinchcliffe wanted the story to be &quot;pacy&quot; and make the Daleks appear more powerful. In a 2006 interview, Dicks said that he does not believe the story would have been much different if he and Letts had been in charge, though he remarked he would have added some lighter moments to soften the &quot;grim&quot; tone. Director David Maloney stated that the images of war at the beginning of the serial were intended to create atmosphere, and he had no intention of losing the younger audience.

The production of &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; saw several changes from the script. Maloney altered the opening scene to show the soldiers gunned down by machine guns in slow motion. Nation was displeased with the change, and Maloney later felt that the violent addition was &quot;a bit much&quot;. Hinchcliffe and Maloney were not keen on the Doctor&#x27;s original meeting with the Time Lord, which took place in a lush garden, and changed it to the Skaro war-zone which they felt more appropriate. The Thal soldiers were originally supposed to be boys aged 15 or 16 to illustrate the youth of those fighting in the war, but this was later changed to make them appear more mature. In the &quot;Genesis of Terror&quot; script, Sarah Jane becomes ill in the third episode from radiation poisoning, and Bettan was a male who was introduced in the fourth episode. Part Five originally had more action in the Dalek incubator room and ended with the Doctor&#x27;s question of whether he had the right to destroy them.

===Casting and costumes===
Maloney cast John Franklyn-Robbins as the Time Lord because he had worked with him before and intended his character to resemble Death in &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. Hilary Minster, who played a Thal soldier, had also played a Thal in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973). Minster had been considered for the role of Mogran. Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; (1970) and Professor Whitaker in &quot;Invasion of the Dinosaurs&quot; (1974). Stephen Yardley, who played the Muto Sevrin, later appeared in &quot;Vengeance on Varos&quot; (1985). During filming of &quot;Genesis&quot;, Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in costume and asked for a job; because of his costume, they assumed he was a tramp from the street. Dennis Chinnery, who played Gharman, had previously been seen in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1965) and would later appear in &quot;The Twin Dilemma&quot; (1984).

The character of Davros was designed by Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a &quot;spokesperson&quot; for the Daleks as he felt it was &quot;boring&quot; listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with a small body and a large &quot;green, dome-like head&quot; which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros&#x27; mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher&#x27;s face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. The cast and crew regarded Davros&#x27; effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros&#x27; Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the &quot;disorienting&quot; situation and be able to express himself without using his whole face. Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes in the top of the bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue. Stuntman and actor Terry Walsh appeared uncredited in several roles.

===Filming and effects===
&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; was the last serial of the twelfth season to be filmed, after &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;. As Sarah Jane had been filmed in &quot;Revenge&quot; wearing a combat costume, it was added into &quot;Genesis&quot; that the Doctor would hand her the outfit, into which she changes by the next scene. The story was mainly filmed in January 1975, with some studio recording carried into February. Location filming for the serial took place at Betchworth quarry in Surrey, which represented the landscape of Skaro. Having had trouble with the Daleks on location in &quot;Planet of the Daleks&quot; (1973), Maloney scheduled shooting so that they only appeared in studio scenes. The three active Dalek props used in the serial were originals from the 1960s, and their wear was covered by new paint. Five &quot;dummy&quot; Daleks which could not be operated were also used. Hinchcliffe wanted the Daleks to appear more powerful, and intended to achieve this through low angles and lighting. Duncan Brown, who was responsible for studio lighting, used colours and dark lighting to make the Daleks seem as if they were &quot;emerging from the shadows&quot; and to suggest rather than show the world created to viewers.

The same model was used for both the Kaled and the Thal domes. The gas attack in Part One was achieved through dry ice and green lighting. Some of the Thal guns were re-used props from the First Doctor (William Hartnell) serial &quot;Galaxy 4&quot; (1965). The electric trolley used by the Kaleds in Part One worked in tests, but collapsed when Baker and Marter boarded it. The creature Harry and the Doctor glimpse at the end of Part Two was mainly a reused Ice Warrior costume, while the Thal rocket ship was a reused model from &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (1970). During the filming of Part Two, Miles and Chinnery had trouble fitting the gun on the Dalek. As a result, the scene had to be filmed in two takes, bridged with a reaction shot of the Doctor. Part Two is unusual in that it is one of the very few episodes not to begin with a reprise, and also the first to end in a freeze frame. A stunt double for Elisabeth Sladen was hired for Sarah&#x27;s fall from the scaffolding, but Maloney discovered that she would be falling eight feet, while Sladen had fallen ten feet in rehearsals. Maloney ultimately decided to conclude the episode with a freeze frame ending. Maloney would use the freeze frame technique again, most notably with &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. The third episode overran its 25-minute limit and rather than cut material out the cliffhanger was changed from Davros&#x27; speech to the Doctor being electrocuted. The music for the serial was recorded on 3 March 1975 and the dubbing finished the day before Part One aired.

==Themes and analysis==

Nation, who grew up during World War II, intentionally based the Daleks on the Nazis, and this episode contains many deliberate parallels. The Kaleds dress in uniforms reminiscent of the Nazis and display &quot;fascist salutes&quot;. The Kaleds look to &quot;keep [their] race pure&quot; by banishing the Thals and Mutos. Cast and crew members described it as a &quot;warning to the world&quot; about the danger of allowing authoritarianism to take over. Davros has been likened to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler several times, while physical comparisons have also been drawn between the appearance of Nyder and SS chief Heinrich Himmler; aside from the resemblance, both wear similar uniforms and spectacles. As production of the third episode began, the producers decided to play down some of the Nazi symbolism, and took away Nyder&#x27;s Iron Cross. It briefly reappears in a later scene that was filmed in the first recording block.

Ed Webb and Mark Wardecker, in a paper in &quot;Doctor Who and Philosophy&quot;, interpreted the Dalek history shown in &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; as a warning that &quot;scientists will be the one to bring about the ultimate destruction, the ultimate evil, and &quot;deliberately&quot; so&quot;. They also commented that the serial showed that the Daleks were evil by design, rather than evolution. Davros represents a mad scientist who creates a monster that then consumes him. Sarah Honeychurch and Niall Burr, in the same book, wrote that the corruption of the Daleks showed that creatures should not be created with &quot;such limited moral reasoning,&quot; and that in our world we cannot &quot;impose our own personal human standards on everybody else&quot;.

&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; also displays a battle between good and evil. Letts enjoyed the fact that the story did not have clear heroes and villains, but rather a conflict of principle. The discussion between the Doctor and Davros about the hypothetical viral weapon demonstrates this. Hinchcliffe described it as the &quot;hero meets antihero&quot; moment, with the two engaged in &quot;intellectual grappling&quot;. The episode also presents the &quot;moral dilemma&quot; of whether the Doctor should destroy the Daleks, resulting in the famous &quot;Have I the right?&quot; scene. The Doctor&#x27;s comparison to knowingly killing a child who would grow up to be a dictator shows how the Doctor&#x27;s ethics are influenced by his non-linear experience of time. He considers the good things that may come out of the Daleks, such as that &quot;many future worlds would become allies&quot;. The Doctor&#x27;s conclusion that he does not have the right is an example of utilitarian reasoning, and a &quot;duty-based ethical&quot; position. Sladen recalled that Baker took the scene very seriously, almost &quot;agonising&quot; over the dialogue.

Comparisons to other stories have been drawn. The Time Lord who appears at the story&#x27;s beginning is intentionally costumed to resemble Death in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;. Gareth Roberts has compared this character to the ghost of Hamlet&#x27;s father, setting the protagonist (the Doctor) on a violent mission with which he has moral qualms. Martin Wiggins, senior lecturer and fellow at the Shakespeare Institute at Stratford-upon-Avon, suggests that the Doctor&#x27;s indecision about destroying the Dalek embryos in the &quot;have I the right?&quot; scene is derived from &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==

&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; was first broadcast in six weekly parts from 8 March to 12 April 1975. Viewership varied from 8 to 10 million; Parts One and Two were watched by audiences of 10.7 and 10.5 million, Parts Three and Four were watched by audiences of 8.5 and 8.8 million, and Parts Five and Six were watched by audiences of 9.8 and 9.1 million. Audience Appreciation Indexes were taken for the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth episodes, scoring 57, 58, 57, and 56 respectively.

At the time of broadcast, there were some complaints about the level of violence portrayed. Mary Whitehouse, of the National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association, complained that &quot;Genesis&quot; contained &quot;tea-time brutality for tots&quot;. Scenes objected to included the depictions of war and Nyder hitting the Doctor. David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker, in their &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot; (1998), recorded a positive reaction from fans in regards to creativity and Davros, though one writer noted the ending did not satisfyingly close the story. The BBC&#x27;s Audience Research Report concluded, &quot;A little more complex than some &quot;Doctor Who&quot; adventures, perhaps, and with underlying questions of conscience, the serial had been &#x27;different&#x27; it was occasionally felt and, although dismissed in some quarters as far-fetched, long drawn-out, confused and/or predictable, had provided acceptable escapist entertainment for the majority.&quot; Howe and Walker themselves described the serial as &quot;well-written and full of new ideas, while still remaining true to the Daleks&#x27; roots by effectively equating them with the Nazis&quot;, and particularly praised the production values, pacing, and moral dilemma. They considered it to have a few minor flaws, namely Harry being attacked by a giant clam, some &quot;duff&quot; cliffhangers, and &quot;many of the scientist characters serve no other purpose than to act as Dalek-fodder&quot;.

In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded the serial a full five stars and hailed it as &quot;Terry Nation&#x27;s finest hour for the series&quot;, suggesting that Davros was &quot;the greatest villain in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; history&quot;. He was also positive towards Dudley Simpson&#x27;s score and Davros&#x27;s allies, who were &quot;impeccably written and played&quot; from Nyder to Gharman, but was disappointed that Harry did not have much to do. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer Christopher Bahn noted that it contradicted some aspects of &quot;The Daleks&quot; but that it &quot;[hit] the emotional target dead-on&quot;. He particularly praised Davros and Skaro, but considered the &quot;major problem&quot; with the portrayal of the Daleks was that &quot;we&#x27;re not given any choice but to view them as psychopathic murderers&quot;, and the Doctor came across as a &quot;catastrophically incompetent secret agent&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s Stuart Galbraith gave &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; four out of five stars, calling it a &quot;real fan-pleaser&quot; and writing that Wisher was &quot;superb&quot; as Davros. While noting that the story &quot;is mostly concerned with action and suspense, which it does rather well&quot;, he wrote that it &quot;isn&#x27;t especially original&quot; as it dealt with common time-travel issues, despite doing it in &quot;intelligent ways&quot;. In 2009, &quot;SFX&quot; listed the scene where the Daleks receive their first blaster as the thirteenth scariest moment of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The magazine also named the scene where Harry is attacked by a giant clam as one of the silliest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; moments, noting &quot;even the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories have the occasional dropped stitch&quot;. Charlie Jane Anders of io9, in a 2010 article, listed the cliffhanger of Episode Four – in which the Doctor is forced to tell Davros how the Daleks will be defeated in the future – as one of the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cliffhangers.

Writing for BFI Screenonline, James Donohue thought &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; &quot;shows the series developing a more complex appreciation of the moral issues surrounding being a monster&quot;, but &quot;the plot contrives to prevent the Doctor from having to make the difficult decision himself anyway. He delays Davros&#x27; plans, but he does not change the future. Lacking the courage to answer the questions it raises, &quot;Genesis&quot; shows how challenging, and how infuriating, children&#x27;s TV can be.&quot;

===Legacy===
&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; is one of the most widely known serials of the original run as it was repeated often. It was edited into an 85-minute omnibus version and broadcast on BBC1 at 3:00 pm on 27 December 1975, attracting 7.6 million viewers, and also was repeated in two edited 45-minute episodes as part of the &quot;Doctor Who and the Monsters&quot; on 26 July and 2 August 1982, which attracted audiences of 4.9 and 5 million. It was then repeated in its original serial form on BBC Two in 1993 (averaging 2.2 million viewers) and 2000 (averaging 1 to 1.5 million). In a 1998 poll of readers of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, over 2500 voters placed &quot;Genesis&quot; at the top of a poll to find the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories of all time. In the magazine&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Mighty 200&quot; poll, asking readers to rank all of the then-made 200 stories, &quot;Genesis&quot; came in third place, behind &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; (1984) and &quot;Blink&quot; (2007). In a 2014 poll, the magazine&#x27;s readers again placed the episode in third place. In 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; one of the ten greatest episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; is the first example in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; of &quot;outright revisionism&quot;; the creation story of the Daleks is very different from that established in &quot;The Daleks&quot; (1963), where it was said they evolved from creatures known as Dals, who were once similar to the Thals. Here, the Dals from the original story are changed to Kaleds. &quot;The Official Doctor Who and the Daleks Book&quot;, co-authored by Terry Nation, suggested that &quot;The Daleks&quot; took place during the Daleks&#x27; 1000-year hibernation following &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;, and that the Daleks seen in that story were the descendants of Kaled mutants who had sought refuge in the destroyed Kaled city and discovered Davros&#x27; prototypes and notes. Russell T Davies, who revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005, suggested that the origins of the Time War, a conflict between the Time Lords and the Daleks which contributed to the storyline of the new series, began with the Time Lords&#x27; attempted genocide of the Daleks in &quot;Genesis&quot;.

Davros is resurrected in &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; (1979), played by David Gooderson, and appears in the remaining three Dalek stories of the classic series played by Terry Molloy. He has also appeared in the revived series since &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;/&quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008), played by Julian Bleach. In &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2015), footage from the episode is used with its plot based on the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s moral issue if one has the right to kill a child if they knew &quot;that child would grow up totally evil.&quot; Davros&#x27; early life is additionally covered in the 2006 Big Finish Productions four-part audio series &quot;I, Davros&quot;, which saw Miles reprising his role as Nyder in the fourth episode, &quot;Guilt&quot;.

<text>Andrew Cunningham (8 June 1910 – 14 June 2010) was a political figure and union leader in North East England. Born in Durham, he was jailed for his role in the Poulson scandal of 1974. He lived most of his life in Chester-le-Street.

At the height of his career in 1971 he held the following positions:

*Member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party
*Chairman of the Chester-le-Street and the Northern Region Executive of the Labour Party
*Head of the Northern District of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW) (the biggest union in the north-east, succeeding John Yarwood MBE)
*Alderman of Durham County Council
*Member of the Chester-le-Street town council
*Chairman of Durham Police Authority
*Chairman of Newcastle Airport Consultative Committee
*Member of the Northumbrian River Authority
*Member of the Peterlee New Town Development Corporation
*Member of the Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority

His role with the GMWU in particular gave him considerable influence, via the Trade Union block vote, in the selection of Labour Party parliamentary candidates. The Poulson scandal also destroyed the careers of T. Dan Smith and the Conservative Home Secretary, Reginald Maudling. Cunningham was sentenced to five years imprisonment, reduced to three on appeal. He was paroled from Ford Open Prison in June 1976.

He was the father of Labour politician Jack Cunningham and two other children.

<text>Rachael Domenica Ray (born August 25, 1968) is an American cook, television personality, businesswoman, and author. She hosted the syndicated daily talk and lifestyle program &quot;Rachael Ray&quot;. Other programs to her credit include &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot;, &quot;Rachael Ray&#x27;s Tasty Travels&quot;, &quot;$40 a Day&quot;, &quot;Rachael Ray&#x27;s Week in a Day&quot;, and the reality format shows &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot; and &quot;Rachael Ray&#x27;s Kids Cook-Off&quot;. Ray has written several cookbooks based on the &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; concept, and launched a magazine, &quot;Every Day with Rachael Ray&quot;, in 2006. Ray&#x27;s television shows have won three Daytime Emmy Awards. Ray also played herself in the Netflix revival of Gilmore Girls in 2016.

==Early life and career==
===Early life===
Rachael Domenica Ray was born in Glens Falls, New York, the daughter of Elsa Providenza Scuderi and James Claude Ray. Her mother&#x27;s ancestry is Sicilian and her father is French, Scottish, and Welsh.

When Ray was eight, her family moved to Lake George, New York. Her mother managed restaurants in New York&#x27;s Capital District, including the Lake George Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant, located near the former Gaslight Village amusement park, which attracted many entertainers. Ray also briefly worked at Sutton&#x27;s Marketplace in Queensbury, New York, and later offered to do commercials for the business. She would continue to promote the establishment, especially their cider donuts and grilled raisin bread. She graduated from Lake George Junior/Senior High School.

In 1995, Ray moved to New York City. She worked first at the Macy&#x27;s Marketplace candy counter. When Macy&#x27;s tried to promote her to a buyer in accessories, she moved to Agata &amp; Valentina, a specialty foods store.

===1996–2004===
Moving back to the Adirondacks, Ray managed Mister Brown&#x27;s Pub at The Sagamore, a hotel on Lake George. From there, she became a buyer at Cowan &amp; Lobel, a gourmet market in Albany. Ray credits the concept of &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; to her experience working at the store, where she met people who were reluctant to cook. She taught a course in which she showed how to make meals in less than 30 minutes.

In the early 2000s, Ray came to Price Chopper Supermarkets with an idea to hold some cooking classes for shoppers and perform food demos in stores. During her time working for the chain, she also wrote her first cookbook, &quot;30 Minute Meals.
With the success of her &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; classes, WRGB, the local CBS-TV affiliate, asked her to appear in a weekly segment on their newscasts. This, along with a public radio broadcast and the publication of her first book, led to a &quot;Today&quot; show spot and her first Food Network contract in 2001.

Rachael Ray was the host of the TV show &quot;$40 a Day&quot; for three seasons (77 episodes) from 2002 to 2005. She would travel to various destinations and attempt to eat three meals for $40 a day.

===2004–2017===
Ray, who favors a &quot;quick and easy&quot; cooking style, teaches many simple recipes that she says can be completed in 30 minutes or less, although critics claim her concept does not include preparation time.

Ray says her Sicilian maternal grandfather, Emmanuel Scuderi, and her Cajun ancestry both exert strong influences on her cooking. She uses ingredients such as fresh herbs, garlic, and chicken stock to boost flavors, and believes measuring &quot;takes away from the creative, hands-on process of cooking.&quot; She, instead, favors approximations such as &quot;half a palmful&quot; or &quot;two-pan swirl.&quot;
To critics of her shortcut techniques, Ray responds, &quot;I have no formal anything. I&#x27;m completely unqualified for any job I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; She has also repeatedly said, &quot;I&#x27;m not a chef.&quot;

On her television programs, she has used catchphrases such as &quot;E-V-O-O&quot; (extra-virgin olive oil), &quot;yum-o&quot;, &quot;G.B.&quot; (garbage bowl), &quot;Oh my gravy!&quot;, &quot;delish,&quot; &quot;entréetizer&quot; (entrée-sized appetizer), &quot;stoup&quot; (cross between a soup and stew), and &quot;choup&quot; (thicker than a soup but thinner than a chowder). In 2007, &quot;The Oxford American College Dictionary&quot; announced the addition of the term &quot;EVOO&quot;, short for extra-virgin olive oil, which Ray had helped to popularize, and credited her with coining the phrase.

One of Ray&#x27;s specialties is burgers. She has devoted one of her published works to the topic, &quot;The Book of Burger&quot;.

===Other works===
====Television====
Ray hosted &quot;30 Minute Meals&quot; on Food Network for 11 seasons from 2001 to 2012, as well as a revival of the series starting in 2019.

In 2005, she signed a deal to host a syndicated daytime TV talk show. The show, &quot;Rachael Ray,&quot; premiered on September 18, 2006, and aired until May 24, 2023. Recurrent appearances on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; were used to fuel the launch, much as Dr. Phil&#x27;s show was spun off based on his own frequent visits to &quot;Oprah&quot;. The show tapes in New York City. In coordination with the syndication announcement, Ray said, &quot;People know me for my love of food, but I have so much more I want to share&quot;.

On January 12, 2008, Ray&#x27;s television series &quot;Rachael&#x27;s Vacation&quot; premiered on the Food Network. The show was a five-part food travelogue shot in various European countries.

In 2008, Ray became a television executive producer of a short-lived Latin cooking show on the Food Network, called &quot;Viva Daisy!&quot;, starring Daisy Martínez.

Rachael Ray&#x27;s Week in a Day is a 2010 reality television cooking series hosted by Rachael Ray.

In January 2012, Ray and Guy Fieri were team captains in the Food Network reality series &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;.

In 2016, Ray guest-starred in the second episode of &quot;Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life&quot;, a miniseries revival of &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, as a fictionalized version of herself.

In 2019, Ray fulfilled a long-time goal of voicing a cartoon character when she voiced a character on the Nick Jr. Channel program &quot;Butterbean&#x27;s Café&quot;.

In 2023, Ray announced that she would be ending her talk show after its 17th season, and she will launch her new production company, &quot;Free Food Studios.&quot;

In 2024, Ray and her show were featured in the final episode of the show &quot;The Curse&quot;. Ray played herself on the show, with her guests being Vincent Pastore as himself, and Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder as their fictional characters Whitney and Asher Siegel.

====Magazines====
In 2003, Ray posed for the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;FHM.&quot; Though she was not nude in any of the photos, this drew criticism so harsh, not least of which from Ray&#x27;s own mother, that in a March 2, 2009 ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; interview she gave to Cynthia McFadden, an ABC News correspondent, Ray defended her decision to pose in the magazine. The interview quoted her as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d do it again tomorrow.&quot;

The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association launched Ray&#x27;s magazine &quot;Every Day with Rachael Ray&quot; on October 25, 2005. The magazine featured seven issues in 2006 and increased to 10 issues in 2007. In October 2011, Meredith Corporation acquired the magazine.

====Product endorsements====

In November 2006, Ray became a spokeswoman for Nabisco crackers. She appears in commercials and on boxes for the many Nabisco products. Many boxes with Ray&#x27;s picture have her recipes.

In February 2007, WestPoint Home launched sheets, blankets, and coverlets designed by Ray. Within six months, WestPoint expanded Ray&#x27;s bed and bath line to include the &quot;Moppine,&quot; a two-in-one dish towel/oven mitt, as Ray is often seen with a kitchen towel over her shoulder that doubles for her as an ersatz mitt.

In March 2007, the Dunkin&#x27; Donuts company announced Ray as its celebrity endorser, mainly of its coffee, since she had denied being able to make coffee herself. As part of a promotional campaign, Ray describes the company&#x27;s coffee as &quot;fantabulous.&quot;

In May 2007, Ray&#x27;s recipes were made available on AT&amp;T cellular phones via the &quot;Rachael Ray Recipes on the Run&quot; feature.

In July 2008, Rachael Ray&#x27;s &quot;Nutrish&quot; pet food was introduced. The dog foods are created from recipes Ray developed for her pit bull, &quot;Isaboo&quot;. All proceeds from the sale of these products go to Rachael&#x27;s Rescue, a charity which Ray organized specifically to provide assistance for at-risk animals.

In December 2016, PulteGroup started Rachael Ray Home Collection for their interior design division. The furniture it markets is all of Ray&#x27;s own design.

==Personal life==
On September 24, 2005, in Montalcino, Tuscany, Italy, Ray married John M. Cusimano. Ray&#x27;s main residence is located in Lake Luzerne, New York. She also owns a Manhattan Greenwich Village apartment which is located near the studio. The Lake Luzerne home was destroyed in a fire on August 9, 2020. The next day, a director of emergency services with the county stated that there were no injuries to Ray or her family.

In June 2009, Ray stated that &quot;hard work was too much for her to be a [mother]&quot;.

===Charitable work===
In 2006, Ray launched the Yum-O! nonprofit organization. Its mission is to &quot;empower kids and their families to develop healthy relationships with food and cooking. This goal is achieved by teaching families to cook, feeding hungry kids, and funding cooking education.&quot;

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ray joined with the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America to support a charity in Ukraine, the Unbroken National Rehabilitation Center in Lviv with projects and programs related to food and children.

<doc id="667018" wikidata="Q440066" url="?curid=667018" title="Sergio García">
<text>Sergio García Fernández (; born 9 January 1980) is a Spanish professional golfer. He turned professional in 1999 and played on the European Tour and PGA Tour prior to joining LIV Golf in 2022. García has won 36 international tournaments as a professional, most notably the 2008 Players Championship and the 2017 Masters Tournament. García was also the Chairman of Spanish football team CF Borriol.

García has spent much of his career in the top 10 of the Official World Golf Ranking, including over 300 weeks in the top 10 between 2000 and 2009, and over 450 weeks in the top 10 in total. He reached his highest career ranking, second, after winning the HSBC Champions tournament in November 2008. García has achieved career earnings of more than US$43 million. As a player, he is noted for strong iron play and accuracy. In the Ryder Cup, he competed in ten of the eleven matches playing during his professional career cumulatively earning a record 28.5 points during those matches.

==Early years and amateur career==
García began playing golf at the age of three and was taught by his father, Victor, who is a club professional. García won his club championship at age 12. Four years later, he set a record as the youngest player to make the cut at a European Tour event, the 1995 Turespaña Open Mediterrania. This record was broken by amateur Jason Hak in November 2008 at the UBS Hong Kong Open, beating García&#x27;s record by 107 days. In 1995, García became the youngest player to win the European Amateur. He followed that with a win in the Boys Amateur Championship in 1997. He won a professional tournament, the 1997 Catalan Open, as an amateur.

Garcia was part of the Spanish teams winning the European Boys&#x27; Team Championship in 1996 and 1997. In 1998, he won The Amateur Championship at Muirfield and reached the semi-finals of the U.S. Amateur. He also finished second in the 1998 Argentine Open, being the low amateur, and winning the Pereira Iraola Cup.

==Professional career==
García turned professional in 1999 after shooting the lowest amateur score in the 1999 Masters Tournament. His first title on the European Tour came in his sixth start as a professional, in July 1999 at the Irish Open. He first achieved worldwide prominence with a duel against Tiger Woods in the 1999 PGA Championship, where he eventually finished second, losing by one stroke. Late in the final round, García with his ball up against a tree trunk in the right rough on the 16th hole, and the green hidden from view, he swung hard with his eyes shut and hit a low curving fade that ran up onto the green. As the shot traveled, he sprinted madly into the fairway and then scissor-kick jumped to see the result. Shortly afterwards he became the youngest player ever to compete in the Ryder Cup. In 2002, during a practice round, García made an albatross (double eagle) on the par-5 second hole at the Masters, one of the few players to have ever done so. On the hole at the Augusta National Golf Club, he holed a 2-iron following a drive.

When García first turned professional, he had an unorthodox swing with a circular loop and long large lag, and this method drew comparisons to Ben Hogan, one of the best players of all time. But during the 2003 season, he worked towards making his swing more conventional, but has largely kept his original method. In his early years, he repeatedly gripped, released, and regripped his hands on the club handle before finally taking a shot. This &quot;waggle&quot; habit created a stir, especially at the 2002 U.S. Open when some spectators shouted out, &quot;Hit the ball, Sergio!&quot;, and some people audibly counted the number of regrips into the twenties. Since then he has eliminated the habit. Responding to criticism of his swing, he said, &quot;My swing works for me, so why should I change it? I prefer to have a natural swing and play well rather than a perfect swing and not be able to play good.&quot;

===PGA Tour titles===

At the age of 21, García won his first PGA Tour event at the 2001 MasterCard Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas, and then won again at the Buick Classic in New York the same year. He was the youngest Tour winner since Tiger Woods in 1996 at age 20. In 2002, García won the Mercedes Championships in early January, and in 2004, he won the EDS Byron Nelson Championship and the Buick Classic for the second time. His sixth PGA Tour victory came at the 2005 Booz Allen Classic. As of October 2020, he has eleven PGA Tour victories, including the 2017 Masters Tournament. He also plays a limited schedule on the European Tour, where he has 16 tour level victories to his name.

===Ryder Cup star===
García has been a member of every European Ryder Cup team since 1999, with the exception of 2010 and 2023, and has a career record at the Ryder Cup of 25–13–7 (). He has been in six winning sides and his singles win in 2018 made him the all-time Ryder Cup points leader, with 25 points in 9 appearances, overtaking Nick Faldo&#x27;s 25 points in 11 appearances. By winning three of his four matches at Whistling Straits in 2021, he extended this record to 28 points, and also surpassed Faldo as the player with the most individual match victories, with 25.

In the 2006 Ryder Cup, at the K Club in Republic of Ireland, García won both his fourball and foursome matches (with José María Olazábal and Luke Donald, respectively) on day one, beating David Toms and Brett Wetterich in the fourballs and Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk in the foursomes. On day two, he paired up with Olazábal again, who won both their matches against Phil Mickelson and Chris DiMarco in both the foursomes and fourballs. Going into the final day in the singles, García was heavily tipped to be the second person to win all their matches in one Ryder Cup; however, Stewart Cink beat him 4 and 3. Europe won the cup again, with 18 points to the United States&#x27; 9 points. At the 2020 Ryder Cup, Garcia won the inaugural Nicklaus-Jacklin Award for the European team. It is an award given to the player whose teamwork, sportsmanship, performance and decisions epitomized the spirit of the Ryder Cup.

===2007: Near-miss at the Open Championship===
In March 2007, García received criticism for a spitting incident at the WGC-CA Championship. During his third round García spat into the bottom of the cup on the 13th green after three-putting for bogey. After missing the cut in the first two major championships of 2007, García came close to winning The Open Championship – his favourite of the four majors – at Carnoustie Golf Links in Scotland. He held the lead after each one of the first three rounds and carried a three-shot lead over Steve Stricker and a six-shot lead over the rest of the field into the start of the fourth day.

At an early stage of the last round, García had extended his lead to four shots, but bogeys at the 5th, 7th, and 8th holes brought him back to the field. On the final challenging hole, he needed a par to win, but failed to get up and down from the greenside bunker. The last putt on the 18th hole on Sunday, from about , would have given him his first professional major. He missed it by a fraction and faced a four-hole playoff with Pádraig Harrington that he eventually lost by one stroke.

In his post-round news conference, García seemed to suggest that bad breaks had cost him the Open championship. During the playoff, on the long par-3 16th hole, his tee shot hit the flagstick but then bounced from the pin, off the green, and García could not convert for birdie. &quot;It&#x27;s not the first time, unfortunately&quot;, he stated. &quot;I don&#x27;t know... I&#x27;m playing against a lot of guys out there, more than the field.&quot; In the 2007 PGA Championship, he was disqualified after signing an incorrect scorecard after the third round.

===2008: Victory at the Players Championship and near-miss at the PGA Championship===

On 11 May 2008, García won The Players Championship on the PGA Tour in a sudden-death playoff against Paul Goydos. The playoff began at the par-3 17th, where Goydos hit a pitching wedge that ballooned and fell inches short of the island green and into the water, while García played a sand wedge to within four feet (1.3 m) of the hole. Goydos made double bogey while García made par for the win.

At the 2008 PGA Championship, played over the South Course of Oakland Hills Country Club near Detroit, García narrowly missed out on winning his first professional major championship yet again. Like at the 2007 Open Championship, Pádraig Harrington was able to erase a García lead on the back nine to take the title. García finished two strokes back for his second runner-up finish at the PGA Championship. His most serious mistake during the final round was misjudging his second shot on the 16th, playing into a strong wind, which found the water in front of the par-4 hole&#x27;s green, costing him sole ownership of the lead. Regarding another near-miss in a major championship, García stated, &quot;I felt like I responded well, and he was obviously very good on the back nine, and things just happened his way.&quot;

On 26 October 2008, he won his first European Tour title in over three years, at the first playing of the Castelló Masters Costa Azahar at his home course, the Club de Campo del Mediterráneo in Castellón, Spain. With this win, he rose to a career high of third in the Official World Golf Rankings. He dedicated the victory to compatriot Seve Ballesteros, who was recovering from multiple operations from the brain tumor that would ultimately claim Ballesteros&#x27; life. He won the 2008 HSBC Champions, the opening event on the 2009 European Tour season on 9 November 2008 in a playoff over Oliver Wilson. This win notched him up to a career high second in the Official World Golf Rankings, replacing Phil Mickelson in that spot, who had coincidentally won the HSBC Champions in 2007. García earned more money than any other golfer in 2008, earning $6,979,959 in 26 events.

===2009–2010: Slump in form, competitive break===
After his success in 2008, García had a very disappointing season in 2009, rarely contending and finished ranked 74th on the PGA Tour money list. He had more success on the European Tour where he finished tenth in the inaugural Race to Dubai. His slump continued into 2010, and after missing the cut at the US PGA Championship, García announced he was taking a break from golf and would miss the 2010 Ryder Cup. He also dropped out of the top 50 of the Official World Golf Rankings. Struggles with the putter were the primary cause of his slump, since his ballstriking remained among the best in the world. On 29 August 2010, European captain Colin Montgomerie announced that García would be his fourth vice captain for the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor.

===2011–2012: Return to form===
García returned to competitive play in late 2010 with a new putting grip and this produced better results for him on the greens during tournaments in 2011. After 36 holes, he was near the lead in both the 2011 Transitions Championship and the 2011 Byron Nelson Championship, but both times faded on the weekend to fall out of contention.

García had to withdraw from qualifying for the 2011 Open Championship because of an infected finger. He had originally planned against qualifying for the 2011 U.S. Open, where he was outside the top-50 in the OWGR and was not guaranteed automatic entry. He eventually earned a spot in the U.S. Open after being one of the top four at a qualifying tournament near Memphis. García played well in all four rounds of the U.S. Open, ending in a tie for seventh place at five-under par 279. García finished tied for ninth place in The 2011 Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s. This was his 17th career top-10 finish in a major.

In late June 2011, García almost broke his winless streak dating back to 2008, when he lost at the fifth sudden-death playoff hole to fellow Spaniard Pablo Larrazábal at the BMW International Open. García led the tournament after the 11th hole of the final round with a stunning stretch of holes, which saw him produce three birdies and two eagles in six holes, from holes six to eleven. However his charge to the finish was derailed by four bogeys in five holes, leaving him needing a birdie at the last to make the playoff. In the playoff, both players made consecutive birdies at the first two extra holes (both par 5s) before parring holes three and four (both par 3s). At the fifth extra hole, García had a eagle putt for the victory, but ran the effort four feet (1.3 m) past the hole. The resulting putt lipped out, allowing Larrazábal to hole a two-foot birdie putt for the victory.

García&#x27;s runner-up finish at the BMW International Open ensured qualification for the 2011 Open Championship at Royal St George&#x27;s, through the current form money list exemption. García went on to finish tied for 9th place at the Open Championship, his best finish for four years. He continued the run at the 2011 PGA Championship where he finished in a tie for 12th place, extending his streak to 50 consecutive majors played, the longest streak among active players. In October 2011, García ended a three-year title drought with back-to-back wins in his home country at the Castelló Masters and the Andalucía Masters. García won the Castelló Masters in dominant fashion, with a final score of 27-under-par, 11 strokes ahead of the field. It was the joint third highest victory margin on the European Tour, beaten only by Tiger Woods&#x27; 15 stroke victory at the 2000 U.S. Open and Ernie Els&#x27; 13 stroke win at the 2005 BMW Asian Open. After the win, García dedicated it to the late Seve Ballesteros, stating &quot;That was for Seve.&quot;

The following week, García won the Andalucía Masters, played at the Club de Golf Valderrama, arguably regarded as one of the toughest golf courses on the European Tour. He edged out fellow countryman Miguel Ángel Jiménez by one shot after a tense final round. Following his back-to-back wins, García moved back into the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking. In August 2012, García ended a four-year title drought on the PGA Tour by winning the Wyndham Championship. In doing so, García also secured his place on the 2012 Ryder Cup team. In December 2012, García fired a final round 61 to win the Iskandar Johor Open on the Asian Tour.

===2013: Controversy===

While tied for the lead at the 2013 Players Championship, García hit three balls into the water on the 17th and 18th holes, finishing quadruple-bogey, double-bogey. He finished tied for eighth place. After the tournament ended, García and Tiger Woods (who won the tournament) had a public feud over an incident that occurred during the third round. Two weeks later, at a European Tour players dinner, García was asked about meeting with Woods at the U.S. Open, to which he responded, &quot;We&#x27;ll have him &#x27;round every night. We will serve fried chicken.&quot; The remark was seen as racist. García issued a statement later that night apologizing and then issued another apology the next day, saying that his comments were &quot;totally stupid and out of place.&quot;

===2014–2016===
In January 2014, García won the Commercial Bank Qatar Masters after defeating Mikko Ilonen in a playoff. The win put him back in the world top 10. In July 2014, García finished joint runner-up at the 2014 Open Championship, two strokes behind Rory McIlroy. This was the second time García had finished as a runner-up at The Open Championship and fourth time in a major championship, having still yet to break through. García began the final round seven strokes behind McIlroy, but got to within two after an eagle on the 10th hole. However his challenge was ended when he left his second shot in the bunker at the par three 15th which he would bogey to fall three behind with three to play. This finish moved García back inside the world&#x27;s top five in the world rankings.

The biggest result of García&#x27;s 2015 season was at the 2015 Players Championship; where he tied Rickie Fowler and Kevin Kisner at 12 under par after 72 holes. He was then eliminated after the three-hole playoff, after finishing two strokes behind Fowler and Kisner. Fowler would go on to win in sudden-death. On the Asian Tour, he won the Ho Tram Open in Phước Thuận, Vietnam, beating Lin Wen-tang, Himmat Rai and Thaworn Wiratchant in a four-way playoff.

As the year before at The Players Championship, García came very close to another win on the PGA Tour at The Honda Classic. In a final round showdown with Adam Scott, where the pair started the final round level, the Aussie prevailed by one shot. In May, García won his second AT&amp;T Byron Nelson championship in a playoff over Brooks Koepka. The win was his first on the PGA Tour since 2012 and his ninth career victory, tying Seve Ballesteros for most by a Spanish-born player.

===2017: Major championship win===
In February 2017, García completed a wire-to-wire victory at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic for his first European Tour title in over three years. The victory was García&#x27;s 12th of his European Tour career, as he finished three strokes ahead of Henrik Stenson. The victory moved García back inside the top-10 and after the win García said &quot;Hopefully it will be the beginning of a great year.&quot;

====2017 Masters win====
On 9 April 2017, in his 74th major championship, García broke through and won the Masters Tournament with victory on the first sudden-death playoff hole against Justin Rose. García became the third Spanish player to win the Masters, after Seve Ballesteros and José María Olazábal. The victory also came on what would have been Ballesteros&#x27; 60th birthday.

García shot rounds of 71-69-70 over the first three rounds to enter the final round at six-under par and in the co-lead with Rose, who played together in the final group. This represented García&#x27;s second career 54-hole lead/co-lead at a major championship, after the 2007 Open Championship. García began the final round strongly, with two birdies on his opening three holes and he forged a three shot lead early on. Rose came back though and following bogeys on the 10th and 11th for García, Rose opened up a two shot lead.

The 13th hole was then pivotal, as García scrambled a par and Rose missed a short birdie putt to keep the gap at two shots. García would then birdie the next hole and eagle the par five 15th to tie Rose with three holes remaining. They then both hit their tee shots at the 16th close, but only Rose converted, to again lead by one. Rose however would make a mistake at the 17th, leading to a dropped shot and meaning both players were tied going up the 72nd hole. Both players hit their approach shots close on the 18th green, but Rose burnt the lip with his birdie putt. García had a five-foot putt to win the tournament in regulation play but missed it right resulting in a playoff as both players finished level on 9-under-par after 72 holes.

Playing the 18th hole again, Rose hit his tee shot into the pine straw, meaning his second shot was blocked off by trees, so could only advance his ball 50 yards or so. He played his third to a similar area of the green he had during regulation play. García fired his approach to within twelve feet. Rose&#x27;s putt for par then missed on the left side of the hole, leaving García with two putts for the win. He only needed one, as he holed his birdie putt for his only major championship.

====Rest of 2017====
On 9 October 2017, it was announced that García had parted ways with TaylorMade after 15 years with the equipment brand.

Two weeks later, he won the Andalucía Valderrama Masters. Along with the Omega Dubai Desert Classic and the Masters, it was the first time he had recorded three wins in a single European Tour season. A few days after his win, he spoke about the rising tensions in Spain after the Catalan independence debate, calling on the country to &#x27;be more together&#x27;.

Ahead of the season-ending DP World Tour Championship, Dubai in November, García dropped a huge hint that he was on the verge of signing an equipment deal with Callaway Golf Company after playing a full set of the brand&#x27;s clubs in Dubai.

Following his three-win season, García was named European Tour Golfer of the Year in December.

===2018===
On 21 January 2018, García played a bogey-free 27 holes to win the Asian Tour&#x27;s SMBC Singapore Open by five strokes over Satoshi Kodaira and Shaun Norris. García shot four-under on the back nine to close out a third-round 66, then posted a closing three-under 68 in his final round.

==== 2018 Masters ====
On 5 April 2018, in the first round of the 2018 Masters Tournament, García tied the record for most strokes on a hole in Masters history, shooting a 13 on the 15th hole. García ultimately missed the cut at the 2018 Masters Tournament and failed to defend his title after shooting 81–78.

==== Rest of 2018 ====
García was a member of the 2018 Ryder Cup winning European team at Le Golf National outside of Paris, France on 28–30 September 2018. He went 3–1–0 and won his singles match against Rickie Fowler (2 and 1). European captain Thomas Bjørn made García a captain&#x27;s pick notwithstanding García&#x27;s inconsistent play for much of 2018, but was chosen for his passion and record in the Ryder Cup.
On 22 October 2018, García successfully defended his Andalucía Valderrama Masters hosted by the Sergio García Foundation title after wrapping up a comfortable four-shot victory at Real Club Valderrama in Spain.

===2019===
In February 2019, García was disqualified from the Saudi International tournament on the European Tour for damaging five greens deliberately in anger during his third round.

In March 2019, García was involved in another controversy at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play. García and Matt Kuchar were locked in a quarterfinal duel when things went awry at the par-3 seventh hole. Trailing Kuchar by one, García missed a seven-footer for par to win the hole, his ball coming to rest an inch or two away from the cup. García went after his putt and gave it a quick-rake, and the ball lipped out. Due to the Spaniard&#x27;s swiftness, Kuchar did not have a chance to concede the putt. As such, García lost the hole. Kuchar told the official he wanted to give García the putt, but that cannot be done retroactively. García eventually lost 2 up to Kuchar, who went on to play in the finals of the event.

In April 2019, García missed the cut at the Masters after shooting 73–75, which was won by Tiger Woods, and the missed cut was his 6th straight in a major championship, the longest such streak in his career.

In July 2019, García was again mired in controversy after throwing his driver at his caddie at the final round of the 2019 Open Championship after a poor drive at the fifth hole at Royal Portrush. Later that month, footage emerged of García gouging the teebox after a poor drive on the 16th hole, while competing at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational event in Memphis.

In September 2019, García won the KLM Open in Amsterdam with a one-shot win over teenage Danish golfer Nicolai Højgaard. This was his sixteenth European Tour win.

===2020===
In January 2020, speaking ahead of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, García revealed that he had ended his association with Callaway after just two years together.

In October 2020, García won the Sanderson Farms Championship in Mississippi. He has now won PGA Tour events in three separate decades.

====Tennis debut====
Also in October 2020, it was announced that García would partner Amer Delić in a semi-professional doubles tournament to be held in Austin, Texas. The pair lost their opening match at the Men&#x27;s UTR Pro Tennis event.

===2022===
In May, while competing at the Wells Fargo Championship on the PGA Tour, García had a verbal altercation with a rules official while attempting to find his ball. García became heated after being told it took too long to find his ball, leading to him shouting &quot;A couple more weeks, and I won&#x27;t have to deal with you anymore&quot;. This led to speculation that Garcia would join the Saudi Arabia-led LIV Golf Invitational Series. García resigned from the PGA Tour and was then suspended from its future tournaments after he began to play in the first LIV Golf tournament.

===2023===
Having joined LIV, García was subject to fines and suspension from the European Tour for playing without a conflicting event release. After those sanctions were upheld by an independent arbitrator, in May 2023, the European Tour announced that he had resigned his membership of the tour.

==Personal life==
In July 2017, García married Golf Channel reporter Angela Akins, the daughter of Marty Akins. His sister Mar is married to the footballer Pablo Hernández. Until June 2018, he was also the president and chairman of his hometown football club CF Borriol, for whom he occasionally played in the Tercera División. He maintains residences in Austin, Texas, Orlando, Florida, Borriol, and Crans-Montana.

On 14 March 2018, García became a father. He named his daughter Azalea, after the famed flowers of Augusta National Golf Club and the nickname for the par-5 13th hole where García made par to move ahead and help claim his only major championship. They had son Enzo in April 2020.

García is also an avid Real Madrid supporter and was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico (between Real and archrival FC Barcelona) at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu wearing his green jacket after his Masters victory.

<text>The follis (plural &quot;folles&quot;; , , Fels) was a type of coin in the Roman and Byzantine traditions.

==Roman coin==

The term &quot;follis&quot; is used for a large bronze Roman coin denomination introduced by Diocletian in about 294. The term &quot;nummus&quot; is now thought to be the actual ancient term, but usage of &quot;nummus&quot; has not caught on. At first the follis weighed about 10 grams and was about 4% silver, with a thin layer of silver on the surface. Over the next decades it declined both in size and in silver content.

The word &quot;follis&quot; means bag (usually made of leather) in Latin, and there is evidence that this term was used in antiquity for a sealed bag containing a specific amount of coinage. It has also been suggested that the coin was named Follis because of the ancient Greek word &quot;φολίς&quot; meaning a thin layer of metal (&quot;cf.&quot; Latin &quot;&quot;, &quot;leaf&quot;) which covers the surface of various objects, since originally, this coin had a thin layer of silver on top. The &#x27;follis&#x27; of Diocletian, despite efforts to enforce prices with the Edict on Maximum Prices (301), was revalued and reduced as time passed. By the time of Constantine the Great, it was smaller and barely contained any silver. A series of Constantinian bronzes was introduced in the mid-4th century, although the specific denominations are unclear and debated by historians and numismatists. They are referred to as AE1, AE2, AE3 and AE4, with the first being the largest (near 27 mm) and the last the smallest (averaging 15 mm) in diameter. Namely:
===Discoveries===

Large hoards of folles have been discovered all across the Roman empire. For example, in Seaton Down, Devon, England, near the site of a second- to third-century Roman villa and fortifications, 22,888 &quot;folles&quot; were found in 2013. Fourth century &quot;folles&quot; represent the largest category of coin finds in the United Kingdom. Between 30,000 and 50,000 exceptionally well-preserved &quot;folles&quot; from the first half of the fourth century were discovered in the sea near the north-east shore of Sardinia in 2023.

==Byzantine coin==
The term &quot;follis&quot; is used for the large bronze coin denomination (40 nummi) introduced in 498, with the coinage reform of Anastasius, which included a series of bronze denominations with their values marked in Greek numerals. 

The fals (a corruption of &quot;follis&quot;) was a bronze coin issued by the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates beginning in the late 8th century, initially as imitations of the Byzantine follis.

<text>The fals (, plural &quot;fulus&quot;) was a medieval copper coin first produced by the Umayyad Caliphate (661–750) beginning in the late 7th century. The name of the coin is derived from the &quot;follis&quot;, a Roman and later Byzantine copper coin. As common with most Islamic coinage, the fals was aniconic and usually featured ornate Arabic script on both sides. Various copper fals were produced until the 19th century. Their weight varied, from one gram to ten grams or more.

The term is still used in modern spoken Arabic for money, but pronounced &#x27;fils&#x27;. The plural form &quot;fulus&quot; فلوس is used in contemporary dialects of Arabic (e.g. Egyptian, Iraqi) as a general term for &quot;money&quot;. The French term &quot;flouze&quot; is borrowed from Arabic. It is also absorbed into Malay language through the word &quot;fulus&quot; .

==In popular culture==

* The Malay derivant &quot;fulus&quot; was used as basis for naming the fictional setting of Metrofulus in the 2006 Malaysian superhero film &quot;Cicakman&quot;.

<text>Indian filter coffee is a coffee drink made by mixing hot milk and sugar with the infusion obtained by percolation brewing of finely ground coffee powder with chicory in a traditional Indian filter. It has been described as &quot;hot, strong, sweet and topped with bubbly froth&quot; and is known as &quot;filter kaapi&quot; in India. 

==History==


Until the 17th century, coffee was grown only in Arabia and exported in roasted or baked form. Taking raw coffee beans out of the country was prohibited to protect the Arabian coffee monopoly. According to a legend, Indian Sufi Baba Budan discovered coffee on a pilgrimage to Mecca. He smuggled seven raw coffee beans back to India and planted them in the hills of Chikmagalur in present-day Karnataka.The favorable conditions enabled the coffee plants to thrive in the hills, which were later named Baba Budangiri (&#x27;Baba Budan Hills&#x27;). The British Indian government became very interested in the coffee, and established large plantations in Coorg (present-day Kodagu). Budan&#x27;s original coffee plants are purported to be the ancestors of most of the world&#x27;s coffee trees today.

==Ingredients==

Traditionally, Indian filter coffee is made with Plantation A washed arabica or Peaberry coffee beans. The beans are dark roasted, ground, and blended with chicory, with the coffee constituting 80-90% and the chicory 10-20% of the mixture. The chicory&#x27;s slight bitterness contributes to the flavor of Indian filter coffee.

Traditionally, jaggery or honey were used as sweeteners, but white sugar has been used since the mid-1900s.

==Preparation==
Indian filter coffee is prepared by first bringing water to a boil. A special cylindrical filter is used in the preparation of the coffee. The filter has two metal cups that assemble one over the other. The filter coffee powder is first added to the upper cup on top of the perforated chamber and then compressed with a pressing disc. The boiled water is then poured over the disc and filter. The upper cup is then secured with the lid, and the coffee is allowed to brew. This process allows the water to extract more flavor from the coffee, resulting in a more robust and stronger flavor compared to Western drip coffee.

Once the collector containing the brew is detached, the brew can be combined with hot milk. Sugar may also be added to the filter coffee.

<text>Meg Tilly (born Margaret Elizabeth Chan on February 14, 1960) is an American-Canadian actress and writer.

For her role in the 1985 film &quot;Agnes of God&quot;, she won a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her other film roles include &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983), &quot;The Big Chill&quot; (1983), &quot;Masquerade&quot; (1988), and &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989). For her role in the television series &quot;Bomb Girls&quot; (2012–13), she won the 2013 Canadian Screen Award for Best Lead Actress in a Drama Series.

Tilly has also written multiple novels, including &quot;Porcupine&quot; (2007), which was a finalist for the Sheila A. Egoff Children&#x27;s Literature Prize.

==Early life==
Tilly was born on February 14, 1960, in Long Beach, California, to Patricia Ann (née Tilly), a Canadian teacher, and businessman Harry Chan. Her father was Chinese-American, while her mother was of Irish and Finnish descent. She is the younger sister of actress Jennifer Tilly.

Following her parents&#x27; divorce when she was three, Tilly was raised by her mother and stepfather, John Ward, on rural Texada Island in British Columbia, Canada. She later said that Ward was a violent pedophile. At the age of 12, Tilly started taking dance lessons, in part to avoid her stepfather, and in a few years had developed into a gifted ballerina.

Tilly attended Esquimalt High School in Esquimalt, British Columbia, and also Chief Sealth International High School in Seattle, Washington, where she is listed among its alumni. After graduating from high school, Tilly left home and moved to the United States to pursue a career as a professional dancer. In New York City she studied with Madame Darvash and Melissa Hayden on full scholarship. She joined the Connecticut Ballet Company. She made her screen debut (somewhat ironically) as a dancer in Alan Parker&#x27;s 1980 musical drama &quot;Fame&quot;, despite the fact that Tilly&#x27;s dance career had been halted in 1979, when a dance partner dropped her, leading to a serious back injury.

==Career==
===Acting===
Forced to give up dancing because of complications stemming from her back injury, Tilly moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career as an actress and studied acting under Peggy Feury.

<text>Station identification (ident, network ID, channel ID or [[bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]]) is the practice of radio and television stations and networks identifying themselves on-air, typically by means of a call sign or brand name (sometimes known, particularly in the United States, as a &quot;sounder&quot; or &quot;stinger&quot;, more generally as a station or network ID). This may be to satisfy requirements of licensing authorities, a form of branding, or a combination of both. As such, it is closely related to production logos, used in television and cinema alike.

Station identification used to be done regularly by an announcer at the halfway point during the presentation of a television program, or in between programs.

==Asia==
In Southeast Asia, idents are known as a &quot;montage&quot; in Thailand and the Malay world (except Indonesia, known as &quot;station ID&quot;, terminology shared with the Philippines), and as an &quot;interlude&quot; in Cambodia and Vietnam.

===Indonesia===
Television channels owned by Media Nusantara Citra (RCTI since 2016, both MNCTV and GTV since 2012 as well as iNews since 2018 except by its regional branches), by Trans Media (both Trans TV and Trans7 since 2016), and ANTV (since 2015) no longer air station identifications anymore, although several channels such as NET., BTV, CNN Indonesia, Trans TV, and Trans7 are still airing idents irregularly.

===Philippines===
Station identifications in the Philippines differ from the vernacular meaning in most of the world. They describe what would be referred to as imaging campaigns elsewhere for their national networks, and vary considerably in length, up to twenty-five minutes. These include music video-like presentations representing the season they are meant for, including &quot;tag-init&quot; (summer season), &quot;tag-ulan&quot; (rainy season), &quot;tagtuyo&quot; (dry season) and Christmas Season.

==Europe==
Broadcast stations in Europe do not identify by a callsign (with the digital age, most networks share one or two metropolitan transmitting facilities within a certain region, making identification of the actual transmitter superfluous), however most networks use a brand based on their common channel number. A form of station identification clip is played between programmes, traditionally incorporating the channel&#x27;s logo, and accompanied by a continuity announcer that introduces the next programme (and promotes other programmes). These identifiers evolved from mainly being mechanical models (such as the BBC globe), to becoming more advanced through the evolution of CGI during the 1980s. From the 1960s to the 1990s, most broadcasters only used a single identifier, sometimes using special variations for holidays and special events. In the present day, most broadcasters use a set of multiple identifiers built around a particular theme or branding element, often based on the channel&#x27;s current overall look.

Prior to 1988, the two existing channels in the Netherlands, Nederland 1 and Nederland 2, used only the idents of the broadcasters airing on them. With the creation of Nederland 3, all three channels started using their own idents.

===United Kingdom===

Prior to 1 January 1988, each programme on ITV would be preceded by the identifier of the regional company that had produced the show (known as a frontcap), and this would be broadcast throughout the network, in other words by all companies showing the programme. The programme frontcap was preceded by station identification and continuity announcements from the viewer&#x27;s local region. It meant that viewers across the country would see a Yorkshire Television logo and hear the corresponding fanfare before &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; and Scottish Television idents before &quot;Take the High Road&quot;. In consequence, most ITV-produced series shown abroad would also be preceded by the producing company&#x27;s logo – for example, PBS presentations of &quot;Upstairs, Downstairs&quot; featured the London Weekend Television logo and fanfare before the start of the programme. Beginning in 1988, these were largely replaced by endcaps.

Since the consolidation of the ITV network in the early 2000s, regional continuity announcements have generally disappeared, with STV being the only notable exceptions. UTV continued using local continuity announcements even under the ownership of ITV, although in 2020 they were suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, and staff cutbacks were made with the Belfast studio. ITV later eventually made these changes permanent, and the local announcers were let go in November 2020.

==North America==
===Mexico===
The Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión enacted in 2014 does not include a requirement for regular on-air station identification. However, many stations continue to air twice an hour their call letters (in Spanish) along with their city of license, as was required previously under Article 76 of the Ley Federal de Radio y Televisión.

===United States===
The United States&#x27; Federal Communications Commission (FCC) enforces specific requirements for identification that must be followed by all terrestrial radio and television stations. Stations must, when they sign on, sign off, and as close to the top of each hour as feasibly possible (such as within a &quot;natural break&quot; in programming, like a commercial break), present a visual (television) or aural (radio) station identification that contains, at minimum, the station&#x27;s callsign, followed by its designated city of license. As a courtesy, top-of-hour identifications may also contain additional information, such as frequencies and a declaration of the station&#x27;s ownership. Only the name of the licensee, the station&#x27;s frequency or channel number as stated on its license, and/or network affiliations, may be inserted between the call letters and station location. An example of declared ownership on KTLA in Los Angeles during the late 1970s were the local announcer invoking then-station owner Golden West Broadcasters (&quot;Golden West Broadcasters-Channel 5, KTLA Los Angeles&quot;). For many years, many television stations demonstrate the station identification for other reasons, including delivering public service announcements, addressing community bulletin boards, or whenever a station experiences technical difficulties.

Stations which broadcast on additional full- or low-powered signals must also identify them all every hour. However, stations licensed as translators must be identified in their own right only three times per day: once between 7 and 9 a.m., 12:55 and 1:05 p.m., and 4 and 6 p.m. FCC rules specify that additional communities a station serves may also be listed in a legal ID, but the official city of license must always be listed first. The advent of broadcast automation has made it much easier for broadcasters to ensure compliance with identification rules. Many television stations and radio stations may have their identifications prerecorded or programmed to play automatically at the appropriate times. It may also be monetized into an advertisement, with the station placing the required text into a quick ad spot where an advertiser such as a law firm sponsors a program with their slogan said.

====Radio====
On radio, the top-of-hour ID must contain the full, legal call sign (including any relevant suffixes, particularly &quot;FM&quot;) as assigned by the FCC, followed immediately by the station&#x27;s community of license. The call letters must be spoken individually; even if the call letters are pronounced as a word for branding purposes (such as WHAM in Rochester, New York, which is spoken as &quot;Wham&quot;), the legal ID must still spell out the individual letters. An example of a proper spoken radio station identification in the United States would be &quot;WMAS-FM Enfield Springfield&quot; or &quot;WLAN-FM Lancaster&quot;. Often, these identifications may be artificially pitch shifted to be faster, to fit in more advertising or promotion within the sequence.

The FCC also allows that: &quot;the name of the licensee, the station&#x27;s frequency, the station&#x27;s channel number, as stated on the station&#x27;s license, and/or the station&#x27;s network affiliation may be inserted between the call letters and station location&quot;.

====Television====
On television, station identification may occur in either a visual format or aural. As no audio announcement of the call sign is necessary if the information appears on screen, often the identification is fulfilled by incorporating it into a short promo for a program the station airs (such as a syndicated or network program, or a preview of an upcoming newscast), the title sequence of the station&#x27;s newscasts, or automatically cued as a digital on-screen graphic briefly displayed at the required time. The identification can even be monetized as part of a regular commercial, with the text appearing in small type on the bottom of the screen (for instance, a law firm can sponsor a court show and directly lead into the beginning of a program with proper station identification, along with their ad). Translators are required to be identified and listed daily at 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. local time.

FCC rules developed for analog television required that translators identify themselves individually. The transition to digital television made this a more challenging rule to implement technically and economically.

In a 2004 order the FCC suspended identification requirements for LPTV and translator stations:

Although we recognize the value of the ITU provisions for station identification, we conclude that we cannot at this time establish identification requirements for digital LPTV and TV translator stations, nor do we believe it would be appropriate to attempt to &quot;bootstrap&quot; our current analog identification requirements for digital station operations. The record in this proceeding lacks sufficient technical and cost information from which to develop standards for this purpose. We do not wish to impose requirements that could now be cost prohibitive for licensees of translator and LPTV stations, thereby discouraging their conversion to digital operation.
As of July 2022, the FCC is proposing to reinstate identification requirements for LPTV and translator stations.

The advent of digital television originally made it necessary for stations simulcasting both their analog and digital on the same channel to include both call signs in all identifications. Both stations have the same base callsigns, with the only difference being the analog ending in &quot;-TV&quot; and digital ending in &quot;-DT&quot; (originally &quot;-HD&quot;). Low-power stations identify with the designator &quot;-LD&quot;. After the June 2009 digital transition, stations had a one time opportunity offered by the FCC to either retain the -DT designation on their digital signal, or move over the analog calls with either the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix or no suffix if so identified. Additionally, a station could add the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix to their calls for standardization purposes among broadcast groups, even if those calls were not shared by an AM or FM radio station. PSIP also continuously carries the station&#x27;s ID digitally encoded.

====Digital subchannels====
Digital subchannels usually identify themselves in one of two ways, with a limit of seven characters in the PSIP tag:
* By first providing the call letters, followed by the main channel number, and then the subchannel broken up by either a dot or a dash. For example, &quot;WXXX 2.3&quot; or &quot;WXXX 2–3&quot;.
* The station may identify the channel as a certain stream by placing the subchannel number after the &quot;-DT&quot; designation within the callsign, as in &quot;WXXX-DT3&quot; for that station&#x27;s third subchannel.

In addition, subchannels which carry weather information – such as those carrying a still of their weather radar, AccuWeather, or a weather feed created by the station itself – may identify that channel via their PSIP flag with the non-standard &quot;WX&quot; suffix, as in &quot;WXXX-WX&quot;, though they must be identified by their subchannel number in on-air identifications. Some subchannels may also display only the name of the network it is affiliated with in the PSIP flag rather than the station&#x27;s calls.

The former two standards are voluntary and interchangeable, and the station can choose to identify all the channels by only the base callsign, although they are encouraged to differentiate each channel from the primary channel (or for LP/Class A analog-only stations digitally airing as a subchannel on a sister or LMA partner station). The primary channel usually does not use a .1/-1 or -DT1 suffix to identify itself beyond some PBS member stations such as the stations of Milwaukee PBS, and minor broadcasters which sell subchannel space to other broadcasters for their own brokered programming. More robust electronic program guide data provided by a smart TV manufacturer or system (such as Roku&#x27;s backend TV firmware) via a broadband connection can be provided outside the PSIP stream to identify the station, but is not considered a legal station identification on its own.

====Identification on other types of signals====
In the United States, the policy on radio identification depends on the service. Station identification is usually done in the station&#x27;s standard mode of operation, though the FCC considers Morse code identification to be universally acceptable no matter what mode the station is operating in.

Low-power (Part 15 in the U.S.) stations do not always identify, being unlicensed (this would be essentially impossible for small FM transmitters for consumer use, such as those used to broadcast music from an MP3 player to a car radio), but those that run as community-based radio stations (including college stations using carrier current) usually do. Station identification in that case usually consists of the station&#x27;s name, frequency, and a slogan; unlicensed stations are not allowed to use formal call signs.

International shortwave broadcasters usually do not use callsigns, instead giving the name of the service and the location of the home office, and occasionally the frequencies that the current broadcast is being transmitted on. There are a few exceptions, particularly in the United States, the time station WWV being a prime example.

Amateur radio requires the call sign to be stated at the end of a communication and every ten minutes during (some hams use countdown clocks to remind them to identify); modes such as packet radio and fast-scan television often have a provision for automatic identification, either including it as part of a digital data stream or overlaying it over an analog picture. Repeaters are often designed to automatically transmit the repeater&#x27;s callsign, usually in Morse code. The requirements for the United States are covered in Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 97.119.

Land mobile two-way (including public safety and business mobile) require station identifications by call sign. In the case of the GMRS service, this is to be done by each station in a similar manner to the amateur practice, though the time limit is fifteen minutes. Repeater systems used in both the land mobile and amateur radio services often have provisions for announcing the repeater&#x27;s call sign, either in voice or Morse code.

Citizen&#x27;s Band radio no longer maintains a requirement for station or transmission identification, but operators are &quot;encouraged to identify&quot; transmissions using one of the following: a previously assigned callsign, &quot;K&quot; prefix followed by operator initials and residence zip code, operator&#x27;s name, or &quot;organizational description including name and any applicable operator unit number.&quot; The use of a &quot;handle&quot; (nickname) is encouraged by CB rule 17 only in conjunction with these methods, not by itself. Most CB operators prefer to use self-assigned handles reflecting some aspect of their personality; it is generally considered a breach of CB etiquette to use real names, even that of the user.

Family Radio Service and Multi-Use Radio Service have no station identification requirement, though groups of individual users have their own procedures, such as using license plates or informal callsigns (some groups within the Boy Scouts of America, for example, use the troop number followed by the scout&#x27;s initials as a callsign).

Wi-Fi access points are not required by law to identify (they are unlicensed transmitters) but the Wi-Fi standards include provision for an identifier called an SSID, which is transmitted as a routine part of Wi-Fi network traffic. However, since a number of standard Wi-Fi channels are shared with the amateur radio spectrum, amateur radio-operated High Speed Multimedia (HSMM), or &quot;hinternet&quot;, access points usually use the call sign of the control operator as the SSID, this suffices as proper station identification for the access point being operated as an amateur radio transceiver.

=====Digital broadcasting and FM translators for AM stations=====
With the advent of digital radio, station identification becomes more complicated, because more than one audio stream can be part of the same station. Stations broadcasting HD Radio feeds identify by their stream channel, and unlike television, the HD1 channel (which in the vast majority of cases, carries the same program as the analog signal) is included in the identification (for example, &quot;WXSS-HD1, Wauwatosa/Milwaukee&quot;, &quot;98.3, WZRL-HD1, Plainfield-Indianapolis&quot; or &quot;WCBS-FM-HD1, New York City&quot;). AM stations which simulcast via an FM HD subchannel identify both the main stream and the HD stream, and if broadcasting in HD Radio format in AM, also list that as part of the identification (for example, &quot;WISN HD, Milwaukee, and WRNW-HD2, Milwaukee&quot;, or &quot;WINS and WINS-FM-HD1, New York&quot;). The same is done for AM stations airing on an FM translator, though the identification is flexible on whether the AM station or translator is mentioned first; for instance, WCLB in Sheboygan, Wisconsin (before taking on an agreement in January 2024 to simulcast WGXI) preferred to brand using the FM translator rather than their maligned AM signal, thus their identification was said as &quot;107.3 FM, W297CK, and 950 AM, WCLB, Sheboygan&quot;.

The FCC clarified what is required in these cases:

§ 73.1201 Station Identification.

 (b) Content.
 (1) Official station identification shall consist of the station&#x27;s call letters immediately followed by the community or communities specified in its license as the station&#x27;s location; Provided, That the name of the licensee, the station&#x27;s frequency, the station&#x27;s channel number, as stated on the station&#x27;s license, and/or the station&#x27;s network affiliation may be inserted between the call letters and station location. DTV stations, or DAB Stations, choosing to include the station&#x27;s channel number in the station identification must use the station&#x27;s major channel number and may distinguish multicast program streams. For example, a DTV station with major channel number 26 may use 26.1 to identify an HDTV program service and 26.2 to identify an SDTV program service. A radio station operating in DAB hybrid mode or extended hybrid mode shall identify its digital signal, including any free multicast audio programming streams, in a manner that appropriately alerts its audience to the fact that it is listening to a digital audio broadcast. No other insertion between the station&#x27;s call letters and the community or communities specified in its license is permissible.
==Oceania==
===Australia===
Station identification in Australia is not limited to the designated common or on-air name of the station or network affiliation, both for radio and television.

A radio station may have call letters related to its town or district name, and the company name; for example, Charters Towers, Queensland station 4CHT and Ceduna Community Radio Inc&#x27;s 5CCR in Ceduna, South Australia. The station may have a name-callsign completely different from its licensed callsign, such as Wollongong, New South Wales station 2UUL, which is branded on-air as &quot;Wave FM&quot;.

A television station usually associates with its network; for example, the Regional Television Queensland station RTQ is known as WIN Television (itself associated with the larger Nine Network), and WIN&#x27;s original station at Wollongong bears the callsign WIN.

==Digital on-screen graphics and teletext==
Teletext, an information service provided by many broadcasters, provides station or network identification in many countries worldwide. As almost all modern sets can display this information, it is a simple matter of checking teletext if the identity of the station is not clear. Some broadcasters do not provide a teletext service, and there is no specific requirement or standard for station identification in it. While teletext is widespread in Europe and is closely associated with the PAL television system worldwide, it was non-existent in North America during the analog television era, in which the NTSC standard was used. However, digital television standards generally include station identification.

A common worldwide practice is to use a small overlay graphic known as a Digital on-screen graphic (DOG), &quot;bug&quot; or watermark created by a character generator in the corner of the screen, showing the logo of the channel. While not a substitute for proper station identification, this makes it easy to identify the station at a glance. VH1 originated the practice in the United States around 1993, with most other cable networks following until most started using them in the early 2000s.

Amateur television operators (and also, news channels in other countries) often use a lower third or bug containing their callsign in lieu of voice identification. This is an accepted practice in the United States and United Kingdom.

<text>An electoral (congressional, legislative, etc.) district, sometimes called a constituency, riding, or ward, is a geographical portion of a political unit, such as a country, state or province, city, or administrative region, created to provide the voters therein with representation in a legislature or other polity. That legislative body, the state&#x27;s constitution, or a body established for that purpose determines each district&#x27;s boundaries and whether each will be represented by a single member or multiple members. Generally, only voters (&quot;constituents&quot;) who reside within the district are permitted to vote in an election held there. The district representative or representatives may be elected by single-winner first-past-the-post system, a multi-winner proportional representative system, or another voting method. 

The district members may be selected by a direct election under wide adult enfranchisement, an indirect election, or direct election using another form of suffrage.

==Terminology==


The names for electoral districts vary across countries and, occasionally, for the office being elected. The term &quot;constituency&quot; is commonly used to refer to an electoral district, especially in British English, but it can also refer to the body of eligible voters or all the residents of the represented area or only those who voted for a certain candidate.

In American English, the term &quot;congressional district&quot; is used.

In Canadian English, the term &quot;electoral district&quot; is used officially, but are colloquially known as a &quot;riding&quot; or &quot;constituency&quot;. In some parts of Canada, &quot;constituency&quot; is used for provincial districts and &quot;riding&quot; for federal districts. In colloquial Canadian French, they are called (&quot;counties&quot;), while &quot;circonscriptions &quot; is the legal term.

In Australian and New Zealander English, electoral districts are called &quot;electorates&quot;, while the term &quot;electorate&quot; refers specifically to the entire body of voters.

In India, electoral districts are referred to as &quot;Nirvācan Kṣetra&quot; () in Hindi, which can be translated to English as &quot;electoral area&quot; though the official English translation for the term is &quot;constituency&quot;. The term &quot;Nirvācan Kṣetra&quot; is used while referring to an electoral district in general irrespective of the legislature. When referring to a particular legislative constituency, it is simply referred to as &quot;Kṣetra&quot; along with the name of the legislature, in Hindi (e.g. &#x27;Lok Sabha Kshetra&#x27; for a Lok Sabha constituency). Electoral districts for buli municipal or other local bodies are called &quot;wards&quot;.

Local electoral districts are sometimes called &quot;wards&quot;, a term also used for administrative subdivisions of a municipality. However, in the Republic of Ireland, voting districts are called local electoral areas.

==District magnitude==
&quot;District magnitude&quot; refers to the number of seats assigned to each district, and in conjunction with number of districts, determines the number of district seats to be filled in an election. Staggered terms are sometimes used to reduce the number of seats up for election at any one time, when district magnitude is more than one. 

The term &quot;District magnitude&quot; was first used by the American political scientist Douglas W. Rae in his 1967 dissertation &quot;The Political Consequences of Electoral Laws&quot;.

The district magnitude affects the ease or difficulty to be elected, as the effective threshold, or &quot;de facto&quot; threshold, decreases in proportion as the district magnitude increases, unless a non-proportional or pro-landslide election system is used such as general ticket voting.

The effect of varying district magnitude explains Duverger&#x27;s observation that single-winner contests tend to produce two-party systems, and proportional representation (PR) methods tend to produce multi-party systems. where multi-member districts are used, threshold &quot;de facto&quot; stays high if seats are filled by general ticket or other pro-landslide party block system (rarely used nationwide nowadays).

Duverger drew a correlation between proportional representation and multi-party systems ( fragmentation). But many counter-examples exist, as PR methods combined with small-sized multi-member constituencies, of DM of less than 5 for example, sometimes produces a low number of effective parties. Malta, which uses DM-5 districts but where there are only two major parties, is an example of divergence from Duverger&#x27;s rule. (Meanwhile, systems that use First-past-the-post system  election system sometimes elect members of five different parties depending on local conditions in the multitude of separate micro-battles across a country.)

Contests with district magnitude of 1 mostly use plurality voting in &quot;single-member districts&quot; (First-past-the-post voting) but instant-runoff voting is used in other cases. In both systems each voter has one vote.

District magnitude is larger than 1 where multiple members are elected (plural districts), and such districts have available a wide variety of election methods. Such districts usually use one of these systems: plurality block voting (where voter may cast as many votes as the number of seats to be filled), list proportional representation, single transferable vote elections (where each voter casts just one transferable vote). Limited voting and single non-transferable vote is sometimes used but less often. In other cases, each seat in the multi-seat district is filled through a separate contest, usually through first past the post. 

In STV elections DM normally range from 2 to 10 members in a district. But 21 are elected in a single contest conducted through STV in New South Wales (Australia). 

In list PR systems DM may exceed 100, but in many cases the average DM under list PR is only about 14.

District magnitude is maximized where:
* jurisdictions with a single electoral district for the whole elected body (at-large voting). This includes the legislatures of: the Netherlands (1 district for population 13 million and 150 seats), Mozambique (13 million, 250 seats), Serbia (7 million, 250 seats), Israel (10 million, 120 seats), Slovakia (4 million, 150 seats), and Moldova (3 million, 101 seats). In each of these cases, it takes less than a percentage point of the nation&#x27;s electorate to capture a seat. 
* systems use a two-tier form of party-list proportional representation, using both local multi-member constituencies (of various district magnitudes and seat-to-vote disproportions), and national leveling seats, when the nationwide results have priority (Mixed-Member Proportional). That is the case in Scandinavia: Sweden (population 6.5 million, 349 seats, 29 districts, see national apportionment of MP seats in the Riksdag article), Denmark (4 million, 179 seats, 12 districts), Norway (4 million, 169 seats, 19 districts), and Iceland (0.2 million, 63 seats, six districts). 
* systems use a two-tier form of party-list proportional representation, using both local single-member districts, and national leveling seats, when the nationwide results have priority (Mixed-Member Proportional). New Zealand uses such an MMP system. 
* systems use a three-tier form of party-list proportional representation, using both local single-member districts, and state and national leveling seats, to produce proportional rep in each state and nationwide based on party votes cast by voters (Mixed-Member Proportional). From 2017 to 2023, Germany&#x27;s Bundestag also allocated additional members to make up for overhang seat won by parties, single-member-district seats won by parties who were not actually proportionally due them. After 2023, a party may take only as many seats as its proportion of the second vote (party vote) allows, and if it elects too many single-member-district seats, they are disallowed, and allocated to another party.

DM is moderate where districts break up the electorate or where relatively few members overall are elected, even if the election is held at-large.

District magnitude may be set at an equal number of seats in each district. Examples include: all districts of the Northern Ireland Assembly elect 5 members (6 members prior to 2017); all those of the Parliament of Malta elect 5 MPs. Chile, between 1989 and 2013, used a method called binomial voting, which assigned 2 MPs to each district.

In many cases, however, multi-member constituencies correspond to already existing jurisdictions (regions, districts, wards, cities, counties, states or provinces), which creates differences in district magnitude from district to district:
*Republic of Ireland for the Dáil Éireann: 3-, 4-, and 5-member districts. (STV is used)
*Hong Kong for half of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong: 5- to 9-member districts.
*The New Hampshire House of Representatives: 1- to 10-member districts (Plurality block voting is used).
*South Africa 27 million registered voters and 400 seats (with 200 filled in nine provincial-wide districts using party lists, and 200 elected according to PR. Provincial representation in the National Assembly, elected in province-wide districts, ranges from 5 seats in the Northern Cape to 48 seats in Gauteng.

Proportional representation in a district elects multiple members representing a variety of opinion, and therefore relatively few votes are wasted. Where the intent is to avoid the waste of votes, ranked voting and transferable voters are used in addition to the election of multiple members. A quota, a set proportion of votes as a minimum, assures the election of a candidate and allows surplus votes to go to where they might be useful. In such elections, a large proportion of votes are used to elect someone.

The quota is often set as the inverse of the district magnitude plus one, plus one, the Droop quota. Droop is the mathematical minimum whereby no more can be elected than there are seats to be filled, if all the successful candidates were to receive quota. (Such calculation is rendered un-necessary if even one vote is exhausted or rejected during the count process.) 

In a STV contest, a candidate that accrues Droop quota is certain of being elected. STV is intended to avoid waste of votes by the use of transferable votes, but even in STV, if the rules permit voters not to rank all the candidates or prevent them from ranking all the candidates, some votes are declared exhausted, as well at the end votes are not necessarily transferred even if the candidate is elected or declared defeated. Thus it is common for one or two members in a district to be elected without attaining Droop, but still they are seen to be the most-popular at that point in the count.

But where party list PR is used, the Hare quota (the natural electoral threshold) is often used. For instance, in a system that uses party vote tallies to allocate seats, a party with ten percent of the vote will win a seat in a 10-member district as its 10 percent of the vote means it is due one seat of the ten. Thus, a threshold of ten percent in a ten-seat district is equivalent to a Hare quota. That same party will not win a seat in a 5-member district.

In systems where a noticeable number of votes are wasted, such as Single non-transferable voting or in Instant-runoff voting especially if voters are prohibited from ranking all candidates, you will see candidates win with less than Hare or even Droop. 

Larger district magnitudes means larger districts, so reduces the possibility and practice of gerrymandering, Gerrymandering is the practice of partisan redistricting by means of creating imbalances in the make-up of the district map, made easier by a multitude of micro-small districts. 

A larger district magnitude also means fewer wasted votes, and less room for such maneuvers. As well, a fair voting system in the district contests also means that gerrymandering is ineffective because each party gets its fair share of seats however districts are drawn, at least theoretically.

Multiple-member contests sometimes use plurality block voting, which allows the single largest group to take all the district seats. Each voter having just one vote in a multi-member district, Single voting, a component of most party-list proportional representation methods as well as single non-transferable vote and single transferable vote, prevents such a landslide.

=== Minorities ===
Large district magnitude assists in the inclusion of minorities.

Single-winner plurality elections (and other elections with lower district magnitudes) are known to limit the representation of minorities. In the mid-19th century, John Stuart Mill endorsed proportional representation (PR) and STV precisely due to this shortcoming.

With smaller district magnitudes, producing representation of demographic minorities scattered across the country may be achieved by:
* women: some gender quotas compel registered parties to a certain gender ratio between the candidates they put forward in single-seat districts. Zippered or gender-balanced party lists can be forced where multiple-member districts are used. Gender quotas can also be an internal policy, as the one used by the Labour Party since 1995 (see all-women shortlist).
* ethnic groups: 
** Singapore requires one team member (at least) to be of a different race from the others. This is the system of the numerically dominant group representation constituencies.
** in the United States, the Supreme Court ruled that districts should be drawn to create a number of minority-majority districts proportional to the minority population of the area (see majority minority in the United States). This is an implicit, not explicit requirement, based on zoning. 
** in New Zealand, the Māori electorates have been in use for over a century so that voters of Māori extraction can elect their own MPs; contrary to the US&#x27;s solution, the Māori electorates overlap the generic electorates. And unlike the US, the distinction between ethnicities is explicit.

Large district magnitudes increase the chance for diverse walks of life and minority groups to be elected. However, it is not synonymous with proportional representation. If a district allocates seats based on &quot;general ticket voting&quot;, it prevents the district&#x27;s multiple members from being mixed and balanced. Where list PR is used in the district, a closed list PR method gives the party machine, not the voters, the power to arrange the candidates on the party list. In this case, a large district magnitude helps minorities only if the party machine of any party chooses to include them or if the minority group has its own party. In a multi-member district where general ticket voting is not used, there is a natural impetus for a party to open itself to minority voters, if they have enough numbers to be significant, due to the competitive environment produced by the electoral system.

==Apportionment and redistricting==

&quot;Apportionment&quot; is the process of allocating a number of representatives to different regions, such as states or provinces. Apportionment changes are often accompanied by &quot;redistricting&quot;, the redrawing of electoral district boundaries to accommodate the new number of representatives. This redrawing is necessary under single-member district systems, as each new representative requires their own district. Multi-member systems, however, vary depending on other rules. Ireland, for example, redraws its electoral districts after every census while Belgium uses its existing administrative boundaries for electoral districts and instead modifies the number of representatives allotted to each. Israel and the Netherlands are among the few countries that avoid the need for apportionment entirely by electing legislators at-large.

Apportionment is generally done on the basis of population. Seats in the United States House of Representatives, for instance, are reapportioned to individual states every 10 years following a census, with some states that have grown in population gaining seats. By contrast, seats in the Cantonal Council of Zürich are reapportioned in every election based on the number of votes cast in each district, which is only made possible by use of multi-member districts, and the House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by contrast, is apportioned without regard to population; the three major ethnic groups – Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats – each get exactly five members. &quot;Malapportionment&quot; occurs when voters are under- or over-represented due to variation in district population.

In some places, geographical area is allowed to affect apportionment, with rural areas with sparse populations allocated more seats per elector: for example in Iceland, the Falkland Islands, Scottish islands, and (partly) in US Senate elections.

=== Gerrymandering ===

&quot;Gerrymandering&quot; is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for political gain. By creating a few &quot;forfeit&quot; districts where opposing candidates win overwhelmingly, gerrymandering politicians can manufacture more, but narrower, wins for themselves and their party. Gerrymandering relies on the wasted-vote effect, effectively concentrating wasted votes among opponents while minimizing wasted votes among supporters. Consequently, gerrymandering is typically done under voting systems using single-member districts, which have more wasted votes.

While much more difficult, gerrymandering can also be done under proportional-voting systems when districts elect very few seats. By making three-member districts in regions where a particular group has a slight majority, for instance, gerrymandering politicians can obtain 2/3 of that district&#x27;s seats. Similarly, by making four-member districts in regions where the same group has slightly less than a majority, gerrymandering politicians can still secure exactly half of the seats.

However, any possible gerrymandering that theoretically could occur would be much less effective because minority groups can still elect at least one representative if they make up a significant percentage of the population (e.g. 20–25%), compared to single-member districts where 40–49% of the voters can be essentially shut out from any representation.

==Swing seats and safe seats==

Sometimes, particularly under non-proportional or winner-takes-all voting systems, elections can be prone to landslide victories. As the result in each district is not related to votes cast elsewhere and may not reflect a party&#x27;s national popularity, a candidate can often be elected with the support of only a minority of votes, leaving the majority of votes cast wasted, and thus a moderate winning vote of say just 34 percent repeated in several swing seats can be enough to create a landslide increase in seats won by a government.

The district-by-district basis of &#x27;First past the post voting&#x27; elections means that parties will usually categorise and target various districts by whether they are likely to be held with ease, or winnable by extra campaigning, or written off as a foregone loss hardly worth fighting for.

A &quot;safe seat&quot; is one that is regarded as very unlikely to be won by a rival politician based on the constituency&#x27;s past voting record or polling results. 

Conversely, a marginal seat or &quot;swing seat&quot; is one that could easily swing either way, and may even have changed hands frequently in recent decades - the party that currently holds it may have only won it by a slender margin and a party that wants to win it may be able to take it away from its present holder with little effort. In United Kingdom general elections and United States presidential and congressional elections, the voting in a relatively small number of swing seats usually determines the outcome of the entire election. Parties aspire to hold as many safe seats as possible, and high-level politicians, such as prime ministers, prefer to stand in safe seats. 

In large multi-party systems like India, a small shift in election results, sometimes caused by swing votes, can lead to no party taking a majority of seats, causing a hung assembly. This may arise from a significant number of seats going to smaller regional parties instead of the larger national parties which are the main competitors at the national or state level, as was the situation in the Lok Sabha (Lower house of the Parliament of India) during the 1990s.

==Constituency work==
Elected representatives may spend much of the time serving the needs or demands of individual &quot;constituents&quot;, meaning either voters or residents of their district. This is more common in assemblies with many single-member or small districts than those with fewer, larger districts. In a looser sense, corporations and other such organizations can be referred to as constituents, if they have a significant presence in an area.

Many assemblies allow free postage (through franking privilege or prepaid envelopes) from a representative to a constituent, and often free telecommunications. Caseworkers may be employed by representatives to assist constituents with problems. Members of the U.S. Congress (both Representatives and Senators) working in Washington, D.C., have a governmentally staffed district office to aid in constituent services. Many state legislatures have followed suit. Likewise, British MPs use their Parliamentary staffing allowance to appoint staff for constituency casework. Client politics and pork barrel politics are associated with constituency work.

==Special constituencies with additional membership requirements==

In some elected assemblies, some or all constituencies may group voters based on some criterion other than, or in addition to, the location they live. Examples include:
* By ethnic groups: Communal constituencies in Fiji; reserved seats in India for Anglo-Indians and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes; Māori electorates in New Zealand.
* By qualification: University constituency in Ireland and formerly the United Kingdom, functional constituency in Hong Kong.
* By residence outside the country: Overseas constituencies in France and Italy.

== Voting without constituencies ==
Not all democratic political systems use separate districts or other electoral subdivisions to conduct elections. Israel, for instance, conducts parliamentary elections as a single district. The 26 electoral districts in Italy and the 20 in the Netherlands have a role in the actual election, but no role whatsoever in the division of the seats. Ukraine elected half of the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) in this way in the elections in October 2012.

<text>In mathematics, an antimatroid is a formal system that describes processes in which a set is built up by including elements one at a time, and in which an element, once available for inclusion, remains available until it is included. Antimatroids are commonly axiomatized in two equivalent ways, either as a set system modeling the possible states of such a process, or as a formal language modeling the different sequences in which elements may be included.
Dilworth (1940) was the first to study antimatroids, using yet another axiomatization based on lattice theory, and they have been frequently rediscovered in other contexts.

The axioms defining antimatroids as set systems are very similar to those of matroids, but whereas matroids are defined by an &quot;exchange axiom&quot;, antimatroids are defined instead by an &quot;anti-exchange axiom&quot;, from which their name derives.
Antimatroids can be viewed as a special case of greedoids and of semimodular lattices, and as a generalization of partial orders and of distributive lattices. 
Antimatroids are equivalent, by complementation, to convex geometries, a combinatorial abstraction of convex sets in geometry.

Antimatroids have been applied to model precedence constraints in scheduling problems, potential event sequences in simulations, task planning in artificial intelligence, and the states of knowledge of human learners.

== Definitions ==
An antimatroid can be defined as a finite family formula_1 of finite sets, called &quot;feasible sets&quot;, with the following two properties:
* The union of any two feasible sets is also feasible. That is, formula_1 is closed under unions.
* If formula_3 is a nonempty feasible set, then formula_3 contains an element formula_5 for which formula_6 (the set formed by removing formula_5 from formula_3) is also feasible. That is, formula_1 is an accessible set system.

Antimatroids also have an equivalent definition as a formal language, that is, as a set of strings defined from a finite alphabet of symbols. A string that belongs to this set is called a &quot;word&quot; of the language. A language formula_10 defining an antimatroid must satisfy the following properties:
* Every symbol of the alphabet occurs in at least one word of formula_10.
* Each word of formula_10 contains at most one copy of each symbol. A language with this property is called &quot;normal&quot;.
* Every prefix of a word in formula_10 is also in formula_10. A language with this property is called &quot;hereditary&quot;.
* If formula_3 and formula_16 are words in formula_10, and formula_3 contains at least one symbol that is not in formula_16, then there is a symbol formula_5 in formula_3 such that the concatenation formula_22 is another word in formula_10.

The equivalence of these two forms of definition can be seen as follows. If formula_10 is an antimatroid defined as a formal language, then the sets of symbols in words of formula_10 form an accessible union-closed set system. It is accessible by the hereditary property of strings, and it can be shown to be union-closed by repeated application of the concatenation property of strings. In the other direction, from an accessible union-closed set system formula_1, the language of normal strings whose prefixes all have sets of symbols belonging to formula_1 meets the requirements for a formal language to be an antimatroid. These two transformations are the inverses of each other: transforming a formal language into a set family and back, or vice versa, produces the same system. Thus, these two definitions lead to mathematically equivalent classes of objects.

==Examples==
The following systems provide examples of antimatroids:

;Chain antimatroids
:The prefixes of a single string, and the sets of symbols in these prefixes, form an antimatroid. For instance the chain antimatroid defined by the string formula_28 has as its formal language the set of strings formula_29 (where formula_30 denotes the empty string) and as its family of feasible sets the family formula_31
;Poset antimatroids
:The lower sets of a finite partially ordered set form an antimatroid, with the full-length words of the antimatroid forming the linear extensions of the partial order. By Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem for distributive lattices, the feasible sets in a poset antimatroid (ordered by set inclusion) form a distributive lattice, and all distributive lattices can be formed in this way. Thus, antimatroids can be seen as generalizations of distributive lattices. A chain antimatroid is the special case of a poset antimatroid for a total order.
;Shelling antimatroids
:A &quot;shelling sequence&quot; of a finite set formula_32 of points in the Euclidean plane or a higher-dimensional Euclidean space is formed by repeatedly removing vertices of the convex hull. The feasible sets of the antimatroid formed by these sequences are the intersections of formula_32 with the complement of a convex set.
;Perfect elimination
:A &quot;perfect elimination ordering&quot; of a chordal graph is an ordering of its vertices such that, for each vertex formula_34, the neighbors of formula_34 that occur later than formula_34 in the ordering form a clique. The prefixes of perfect elimination orderings of a chordal graph form an antimatroid.
;Chip-firing games
:Chip-firing games such as the abelian sandpile model are defined by a directed graph together with a system of &quot;chips&quot; placed on its vertices. Whenever the number of chips on a vertex formula_34 is at least as large as the number of edges out of formula_34, it is possible to &quot;fire&quot; formula_34, moving one chip to each neighboring vertex. The event that formula_34 fires for the formula_41th time can only happen if it has already fired formula_42 times and accumulated formula_43 total chips. These conditions do not depend on the ordering of previous firings, and remain true until formula_34 fires, so any given graph and initial placement of chips for which the system terminates defines an antimatroid on the pairs formula_45. A consequence of the antimatroid property of these systems is that, for a given initial state, the number of times each vertex fires and the eventual stable state of the system do not depend on the firing order.

==Paths and basic words==
In the set theoretic axiomatization of an antimatroid there are certain special sets called &quot;paths&quot; that determine the whole antimatroid, in the sense that the sets of the antimatroid are exactly the unions of paths. If formula_3 is any feasible set of the antimatroid, an element formula_5 that can be removed from formula_3 to form another feasible set is called an &quot;endpoint&quot; of formula_3, and a feasible set that has only one endpoint is called a &quot;path&quot; of the antimatroid. The family of paths can be partially ordered by set inclusion, forming the &quot;path poset&quot; of the antimatroid.

For every feasible set formula_3 in the antimatroid, and every element formula_5 of formula_3, one may find a path subset of formula_3 for which formula_5 is an endpoint: to do so, remove one at a time elements other than formula_5 until no such removal leaves a feasible subset. Therefore, each feasible set in an antimatroid is the union of its path subsets. If formula_3 is not a path, each subset in this union is a proper subset of formula_3. But, if formula_3 is itself a path with endpoint formula_5, each proper subset of formula_3 that belongs to the antimatroid excludes formula_5. Therefore, the paths of an antimatroid are exactly the feasible sets that do not equal the unions of their proper feasible subsets. Equivalently, a given family of sets formula_62 forms the family of paths of an antimatroid if and only if, for each formula_3 in formula_62, the union of subsets of formula_3 in formula_62 has one fewer element than formula_3 itself. If so, formula_1 itself is the family of unions of subsets of formula_62.

In the formal language formalization of an antimatroid, the longest strings are called &quot;basic words&quot;. Each basic word forms a permutation of the whole alphabet. If formula_70 is the set of basic words, formula_10 can be defined from formula_70 as the set of prefixes of words in formula_70.

==Convex geometries==

If formula_1 is the set system defining an antimatroid, with formula_32 equal to the union of the sets in formula_1, then the family of sets
formula_77
complementary to the sets in formula_1 is sometimes called a convex geometry and the sets in formula_79 are called convex sets. For instance, in a shelling antimatroid, the convex sets are intersections of the given point set with convex subsets of Euclidean space. The set system defining a convex geometry must be closed under intersections. For any set formula_3 in formula_79 that is not equal to formula_32 there must be an element formula_5 not in formula_3 that can be added to formula_3 to form another set in formula_79.

A convex geometry can also be defined in terms of a closure operator formula_87 that maps any subset of formula_32 to its minimal closed superset. To be a closure operator, formula_87 should have the following properties:
* formula_90: the closure of the empty set is empty.
* For every subset formula_3 of formula_32, formula_3 is a subset of formula_94 and formula_95.
* Whenever formula_96, formula_94 is a subset of formula_98.
The family of closed sets resulting from a closure operation of this type is necessarily closed under intersections, but might not be a convex geometry. The closure operators that define convex geometries also satisfy an additional anti-exchange axiom:
*If formula_3 is a subset of formula_32, and formula_101 and formula_102 are distinct elements of formula_32 that do not belong to formula_94, but formula_102 does belong to formula_106, then formula_101 does not belong to formula_108.
A closure operation satisfying this axiom is called an anti-exchange closure. If formula_3 is a closed set in an anti-exchange closure, then the anti-exchange axiom determines a partial order on the elements not belonging to formula_3, where formula_111 in the partial order when formula_5 belongs to formula_106. If formula_5 is a minimal element of this partial order, then formula_115 is closed. That is, the family of closed sets of an anti-exchange closure has the property that for any set other than the universal set there is an element formula_5 that can be added to it to produce another closed set. This property is complementary to the accessibility property of antimatroids, and the fact that intersections of closed sets are closed is complementary to the property that unions of feasible sets in an antimatroid are feasible. Therefore, the complements of the closed sets of any anti-exchange closure form an antimatroid.

The undirected graphs in which the convex sets (subsets of vertices that contain all shortest paths between vertices in the subset) form a convex geometry are exactly the Ptolemaic graphs.

==Join-distributive lattices==
Every two feasible sets of an antimatroid have a unique least upper bound (their union) and a unique greatest lower bound (the union of the sets in the antimatroid that are contained in both of them). Therefore, the feasible sets of an antimatroid, partially ordered by set inclusion, form a lattice. Various important features of an antimatroid can be interpreted in lattice-theoretic terms; for instance the paths of an antimatroid are the join-irreducible elements of the corresponding lattice, and the basic words of the antimatroid correspond to maximal chains in the lattice. The lattices that arise from antimatroids in this way generalize the finite distributive lattices, and can be characterized in several different ways.

*The description originally considered by concerns meet-irreducible elements of the lattice. For each element formula_5 of an antimatroid, there exists a unique maximal feasible set formula_118 that does not contain formula_5: formula_118 can be constructed as the union of all feasible sets not containing formula_5. This set formula_118 is automatically meet-irreducible, meaning that it is not the meet of any two larger lattice elements. This is true because every feasible superset of formula_118 contains formula_5, and the same is therefore also true of every intersection of feasible supersets. Every element of an arbitrary lattice can be decomposed as a meet of meet-irreducible sets, often in multiple ways, but in the lattice corresponding to an antimatroid each element formula_16 has a unique minimal family of meet-irreducible sets whose meet is formula_16; this family consists of the sets formula_118 for the elements formula_5 such that formula_129 is feasible. That is, the lattice has &quot;unique meet-irreducible decompositions&quot;.
*A second characterization concerns the &quot;intervals&quot; in the lattice, the sublattices defined by a pair of lattice elements formula_111 consisting of all lattice elements formula_102 with formula_132. An interval is atomistic if every element in it is the join of atoms (the minimal elements above the bottom element formula_5), and it is Boolean if it is isomorphic to the lattice of all subsets of a finite set. For an antimatroid, every interval that is atomistic is also boolean.
*Thirdly, the lattices arising from antimatroids are semimodular lattices, lattices that satisfy the &quot;upper semimodular law&quot; that for every two elements formula_5 and formula_101, if formula_101 covers formula_137 then formula_138 covers formula_5. Translating this condition into the feasible sets of an antimatroid, if a feasible set formula_140 has only one element not belonging to another feasible set formula_141 then that one element may be added to formula_141 to form another set in the antimatroid. Additionally, the lattice of an antimatroid has the &quot;meet-semidistributive property&quot;: for all lattice elements formula_5, formula_101, and formula_102, if formula_137 and formula_147 equal each other then they also both equal formula_148. A semimodular and meet-semidistributive lattice is called a &quot;join-distributive lattice&quot;.

These three characterizations are equivalent: any lattice with unique meet-irreducible decompositions has boolean atomistic intervals and is join-distributive, any lattice with boolean atomistic intervals has unique meet-irreducible decompositions and is join-distributive, and any join-distributive lattice has unique meet-irreducible decompositions and boolean atomistic intervals. Thus, we may refer to a lattice with any of these three properties as join-distributive. Any antimatroid gives rise to a finite join-distributive lattice, and any finite join-distributive lattice comes from an antimatroid in this way. Another equivalent characterization of finite join-distributive lattices is that they are graded (any two maximal chains have the same length), and the length of a maximal chain equals the number of meet-irreducible elements of the lattice. The antimatroid representing a finite join-distributive lattice can be recovered from the lattice: the elements of the antimatroid can be taken to be the meet-irreducible elements of the lattice, and the feasible set corresponding to any element formula_5 of the lattice consists of the set of meet-irreducible elements formula_101 such that formula_101 is not greater than or equal to formula_5 in the lattice.

This representation of any finite join-distributive lattice as an accessible family of sets closed under unions (that is, as an antimatroid) may be viewed as an analogue of Birkhoff&#x27;s representation theorem under which any finite distributive lattice has a representation as a family of sets closed under unions and intersections.

==Supersolvable antimatroids==
Motivated by a problem of defining partial orders on the elements of a Coxeter group, studied antimatroids which are also supersolvable lattices. A supersolvable antimatroid is defined by a totally ordered collection of elements, and a family of sets of these elements. The family must include the empty set. Additionally, it must have the property that if two sets formula_153 and formula_70 belong to the family, if the set-theoretic difference formula_155 is nonempty, and if formula_5 is the smallest element of formula_155, then formula_158 also belongs to the family. As Armstrong observes, any family of sets of this type forms an antimatroid. Armstrong also provides a lattice-theoretic characterization of the antimatroids that this construction can form.

==Join operation and convex dimension==
If formula_159 and formula_160 are two antimatroids, both described as a family of sets over the same universe of elements, then another antimatroid, the &quot;join&quot; of formula_159 and formula_160, can be formed as follows:
formula_163
This is a different operation than the join considered in the lattice-theoretic characterizations of antimatroids: it combines two antimatroids to form another antimatroid, rather than combining two sets in an antimatroid to form another set.
The family of all antimatroids over the same universe forms a semilattice with this join operation.

Joins are closely related to a closure operation that maps formal languages to antimatroids, where the closure of a language formula_10 is the intersection of all antimatroids containing formula_10 as a sublanguage. This closure has as its feasible sets the unions of prefixes of strings in formula_10. In terms of this closure operation, the join is the closure of the union of the languages of formula_159 and formula_160. Every antimatroid can be represented as a join of a family of chain antimatroids, or equivalently as the closure of a set of basic words; the &quot;convex dimension&quot; of an antimatroid formula_159 is the minimum number of chain antimatroids (or equivalently the minimum number of basic words) in such a representation. If formula_170 is a family of chain antimatroids whose basic words all belong to formula_159, then formula_170 generates formula_159 if and only if the feasible sets of formula_170 include all paths of formula_159. The paths of formula_159 belonging to a single chain antimatroid must form a chain in the path poset of formula_159, so the convex dimension of an antimatroid equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the path poset, which by Dilworth&#x27;s theorem equals the width of the path poset.

If one has a representation of an antimatroid as the closure of a set of formula_178 basic words, then this representation can be used to map the feasible sets of the antimatroid to points in formula_178-dimensional Euclidean space: assign one coordinate per basic word formula_180, and make the coordinate value of a feasible set formula_3 be the length of the longest prefix of formula_180 that is a subset of formula_3. With this embedding, formula_3 is a subset of another feasible set formula_16 if and only if the coordinates for formula_3 are all less than or equal to the corresponding coordinates of formula_16. Therefore, the order dimension of the inclusion ordering of the feasible sets is at most equal to the convex dimension of the antimatroid. However, in general these two dimensions may be very different: there exist antimatroids with order dimension three but with arbitrarily large convex dimension.

==Enumeration==
The number of possible antimatroids on a set of elements grows rapidly with the number of elements in the set. For sets of one, two, three, etc. elements, the number of distinct antimatroids is
formula_188

==Applications==
Both the precedence and release time constraints in the standard notation for theoretic scheduling problems may be modeled by antimatroids. use antimatroids to generalize a greedy algorithm of Eugene Lawler for optimally solving single-processor scheduling problems with precedence constraints in which the goal is to minimize the maximum penalty incurred by the late scheduling of a task.

 use antimatroids to model the ordering of events in discrete event simulation systems.

 uses antimatroids to model progress towards a goal in artificial intelligence planning problems.

In Optimality Theory, a mathematical model for the development of natural language based on optimization under constraints, grammars are logically equivalent to antimatroids.

In mathematical psychology, antimatroids have been used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he or she might be able to solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of problems. In this context antimatroids have also been called &quot;learning spaces&quot; and &quot;well-graded knowledge spaces&quot;.

<text>Navahodads were a roots rock band formed in 1995 by singer-songwriter and guitarist, Brendan Kibble, previously of The Bam Balams with Karl Bergersen on bass, Tim Denny on drums and Michael Maunsell on lead guitar. The Navahodads released two albums, &quot;Mumbo Gumbo&quot; (1995) and &quot;Madame Mojo&#x27;s&quot; (1998). The band&#x27;s sound was described as Texas R&amp;B, swamp rock, soul, and rock.

Interest generated by their first album saw them tour Spain in 1996. For the tour they released a Spanish only single, &quot;If It&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; (Don&#x27;t Bother Knockin&#x27;)&quot;, on the Spanish label Louie Records.
The band split up in 2003 when Kibble moved to the United States. The band had recorded an album&#x27;s worth of new material in 2003, which to date remains unreleased. A critic summarised, &quot;Imagine Buddy Guy on a road trip, swinging by Tony Joe White&#x27;s place, calling on Doug Sahm, and they all go to party in New Orleans...that&#x27;s the vibe of the Navahodads.&quot;

<text>Agave maculata (synonym &quot;Manfreda maculosa&quot;), commonly known as the Texas tuberose or spice lily, is a species of &quot;Agave&quot; that is endemic to southern Texas and northeastern Mexico.

==Description==
The Texas tuberose is acaulescent, meaning the stem is extremely short. The fleshy silvery-green leaves are covered with purple spots and in low light situations may lay flat on the ground. In a drought, the leaves may wither, leaving little or nothing visible above ground. Sufficient precipitation yields an inflorescence tall in the period April–September. The new flower stalks (inflorescences) are fed on by small mammals, javelina, deer, and feral pigs, which can end the flowering effort for that season. The leaves are fed on by these as well, especially during droughts, weakening and killing the plants.

The flowers open and change colors over 3–4 days of life, from white to pink to dark red. The inferior ovaries turn from green to purple to black as they mature as seedpods.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Agave maculata&quot; was first described by Eduard von Regel in 1856. Later, in 1859, William Hooker described the same species as &quot;Agave maculosa&quot;. It was under this synonym that it was transferred to the genus &quot;Manfreda&quot; and then the genus &quot;Polianthes&quot; (both now included in &quot;Agave&quot;), but Regel&#x27;s epithet is the oldest and so has priority.

==Ecology==
Texas tuberose is the primary host plant for the caterpillars of the rare manfreda giant-skipper or aloe skipper (&quot;Stallingsia maculosus&quot; (= &quot;Stallingsia smithi&quot;)). A reduction in the &quot;A. maculata&quot; population could threaten the existence of the butterflies.

<text>Dimboola is a town in the Shire of Hindmarsh in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, Australia, 334 kilometres north-west of Melbourne.

==History==
Situated on the Wimmera River, Dimboola was previously known as &#x27;Nine Creeks&#x27;. Following a survey conducted in late 1862 by contractor Frederick Smith of Ararat, a plan for a township in the County of Dimboola was proposed. It was first recognised as being a township when mentioned in the April 1863 edition of the &quot;Government Gazette&quot;.

Before the arrival of white people into the district, the Aboriginal people called the area Watchegatcheca which had the meaning &#x27;Wattle Tree and White Cockatoos&#x27;. The name &#x27;Dimboola&#x27; has generally been accepted to have come from the Sinhalese word &quot;dimbula&quot; meaning &#x27;Land of Figs&#x27;. The name came from the District Surveyor of the time John George Winchester Wilmot, who had previously lived in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The relationship of the name to this area is suggested to have come from &#x27;Upper Regions Station&#x27; where an abundance of fruit trees grew in the garden, many of which were figs.

The Post Office opened on 3 April 1863, but was known as Nine Creeks until 1869.

The Dimboola Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 January 1983.

Dimboola&#x27;s economy is predominantly rural, with wheat, sheep and timber being traditionally important. There have been recent forays into emu and alpaca rearing and olive plantations.

Paintings of Dimboola landscapes by noted Australian painter Sidney Nolan, who was stationed in the area while on army duty in World War II, can be found in the National Gallery of Victoria. Dimboola is also the setting of the play (and subsequent film) &quot;Dimboola&quot; by Jack Hibberd.

Distinguished Australian-British physicist Richard Dalitz was born in Dimboola, as was World War II nursing matron Olive Dorothy Paschke.

<text>Irpin (, ) is a city on the Irpin River in Bucha Raion, Kyiv Oblast, northern Ukraine. It is located next to the capital Kyiv. Irpin hosts the administration of Irpin urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The city has a population of 

The city has a railway station built in 1899. In 2022, it received the title Hero City of Ukraine.

In the battle of Irpin during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, 70% of the city was damaged. As of June 25, 2023, the city&#x27;s mayor reported that most people had already returned: &quot;Yes, we have already returned 85% of the entire city&#x27;s population. In addition, we have received almost 25,000 internally displaced persons, mostly from the east.&quot;

== History ==
In the 17th century on the site of Irpin were the villages of Romanivka and khutir Liubka. In the 19th century Severynivka village, and khutirs Rudnia and Stoianka appeared.

Irpin was formed in 1899 as a passing loop, during construction of the Kyiv–Kovel railway line. Railway workers founded the town near the railway road along with other localities such as Bucha and Vorzel. The city&#x27;s name (along with the settlement of Vorzel) was chosen due to its location on the Irpin River.

From 26 July 1941, right after the Battle of Kyiv, it was occupied by the Wehrmacht until November 1943, when Kyiv was recaptured. Most of its Jewish population were murdered in either Babi Yar or other massacres by the Nazis.

In 1956, Irpin&#x27;s status was changed to that of a &quot;city of raion (district) subordination,&quot; subordinate to the Kyiv-Sviatoshyn Raion (district).

On 30 December 1962, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian SSR issued a decree changing the status of Irpin to that of a &quot;city of oblast subordination,&quot; thus being directly subordinate to the oblast authorities rather than the city administration housed within the city. Also mentioned within the decree were the inclusion of the urban-type settlements of Bucha (a city since 2007), Vorzel, Hostomel, and Kotsiubynske within the city limits.

Until 18 July 2020, Irpin was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and the center of Irpin Municipality, which also included the urban-type settlement of Hostomel, Kotsiubynske, and Vorzel. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven, Irpin Municipality was merged into Bucha Raion.
=== 2022 Russian invasion ===
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Irpin became the site of a battlefield engagement during the Kyiv offensive. Russian forces took the Hostomel Airport in the north of the city to facilitate an advance southwards, around Kyiv. The city was shelled by Russian artillery while the Ukrainians were able to repel and destroy multiple forces attempting to move into the town. According to Human Rights Watch, on March 6, 2022, Russian forces bombarded an intersection on a road of Irpin which was used by civilians to flee. As of 24 March 2022, 80% of the city was recaptured from Russian occupants by Ukrainian Armed Forces. On 28 March, Mayor Oleksandr Markushyn announced that all of Irpin was fully recovered by the Ukrainian forces. On March 30, the mayor of Irpin said that the Russian military had killed more than 300 civilians and 50 servicemen in the city.

On 31 August 2022, the Declaration on Cooperation was signed in Irpin by the National Republican Army and Russian Volunteer Corps in an aim to overthrow the regime of Vladimir Putin.

On 24 August 2023, the was opened under a collaborative project by Lithuania and Taiwan.

== Economy ==
There are 22 industrial manufacturers operating in the Irpin region. The city has close to one thousand enterprises of various forms of ownership. The most notable are Peremoha Industrial Complex of Irpin (bricks, reinforced concrete components, heat insulation and sound proofing materials), Irpinmash (gears for agricultural industry), Perun Trading Firm (books), KATECH-electro Private Commercial and Manufacturing Company (cabling and wiring products), Irpintorfmash factory (construction materials), and a furniture factory, just to name some.

The agricultural sector of Irpin provides the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, with potatoes and other vegetables.

The city is also a health resort area known for its recreational facilities.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2001 Ukrainian census, Irpin had a population of 100,390 inhabitants, making it the second-largest city in the entire Kyiv Oblast after Bila Tserkva. The population is overwhelmingly Ukrainian, yet sizeable Russian, Belarusian, Polish and Moldovan minorities reside in the city. The exact ethnic composition was as follows:
== Sport ==
The city has a well developed sports infrastructure. At some point it used to host several professional football clubs, among which are Dynamo Irpin (later known as FC Ros Bila Tserkva), Nafkom-Akademiya (later known as FC Nafkom Brovary), and others.

In the summer of 2016 a newly built small city stadium was opened in the city.

There is also a sports school, a football academy, and several other sports organizations such as a rugby club. A number of sports events are conducted regularly at the city&#x27;s stadium.

<text>The Irpin or Irpen (; ) is a river in Ukraine, a right tributary of the Dnieper River. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . Irpin city is one of the urban settlements beside the river.

The original confluence of the Irpin and the Dnieper is beneath the surface of the Kyiv Reservoir, which was formed by the dam for the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant in the mid-1960s. A second dam, immediately south of the village of , was built to stop the reservoir from inundating more of the Irpin river basin. The Irpin reaches the dam 6.5–7 meters below the level of the reservoir and electrical pumps raise it into the reservoir.

The lands around the Irpin were the heartland of Kyivan Rus, and the chronicles mention the river in connection with several important historic events, such as the Battle on the Irpin River of 1321 in which the Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas (Gedemin) allegedly gained control over the lands of what is now central Ukraine. The river also defended Kyiv from German invasion during World War II.

Prior to the creation of Soviet-era dams, the Irpin basin was a biodiverse wetland. 

In 2022, during the first two days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Armed Forces destroyed the three lower bridges over the river, north-west of Kyiv, to hinder the Russian advance on the city. The bridges were at the village of Demydiv (near Kyiv Reservoir) and two at Irpin city. Ukrainian troops also opened the Kozarovychi dam on the second day of the invasion, to flood the Irpin basin, including houses in Demydiv. The flooding effectively created a shallow lake that prevented Russian vehicles from advancing across it. Russian shelling later damaged the dam, which made it more difficult for the Ukrainians to drain the area after the Russians had withdrawn.

Ecologists argue that the dams should not be rebuilt and that the wetland should be protected and restored.

<text>This article lists baronetcies, whether extant, extinct, dormant (D), unproven (U), under review (R) or forfeit, in the baronetages of England, Nova Scotia, Great Britain, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

The holders of some of the baronetcies listed on the lists have died but in each case, up to the present, no person has proved succession and thus been placed upon the Official Roll of the Baronetage. Those that are marked with a &quot;D&quot; in the last column are regarded as being dormant since, although heirs are known to exist, succession has not been proved within a period of five years from the death of the holder.

A baronetcy becomes extinct when heirs cannot be traced and are believed not to exist. In this case, it should not be listed on the Official Roll but would be re-activated should an heir subsequently emerge.

The Royal Warrant of Edward VII of 8 February 1910 states &quot;no person whose name is not entered on the Official Roll shall be received as a Baronet, or shall be addressed or mentioned by that title in any civil or military Commission, Letters Patent or other official document&quot;.

The lists below are not corroborated by The Standing Council of the Baronetage, the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department or the Home Office. In addition, only the first is complete; the other five do not at the moment list all extinct baronetcies.

<text>Poodle Hat is the eleventh studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on May 20, 2003. It was the fifth studio album self-produced by Yankovic. The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop of the early-2000s. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Couch Potato&quot;, is a parody of &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; by Eminem. The single failed to chart, although the album&#x27;s song &quot;eBay&quot; (a parody of &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; by Backstreet Boys) eventually peaked at 15 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in 2007.

The album featured five parodies. Aside from the aforementioned &quot;Couch Potato&quot; and &quot;eBay&quot;, the album also spoofs &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; by Nelly, &quot;Complicated&quot; by Avril Lavigne, and &quot;Piano Man&quot; by Billy Joel. The album includes six original songs, featuring many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations of existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Ben Folds, Beck, and Frank Zappa. A polka medley of popular songs was also included on the album. A music video for the song &quot;Couch Potato&quot; was planned but was cancelled due to objections by Eminem.

&quot;Poodle Hat&quot; was released as an Enhanced CD, meaning that when the disc is placed in a computer, bonus content (including alternate song mixes, short videos, and photo galleries) is viewable. The album met with mixed reviews from critics; some felt that the album represented an artistic misstep for Yankovic, whereas others enjoyed its skewering of early 2000s popular culture. The album peaked at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also peaked at number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Comedy Albums chart, making it the first of Yankovic&#x27;s records to earn a position on said chart.

==Production==
===Originals===

On March 25, 2002, recording for &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; officially began. By mid-2002, six originals—&quot;Hardware Store&quot;, &quot;Party at the Leper Colony&quot;, &quot;Wanna B Ur Lovr&quot;, &quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot;, &quot;Bob&quot;, and &quot;Genius in France&quot;—had been recorded. 

The album&#x27;s first original song is &quot;Hardware Store&quot;, a list song that, as the title suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store and describes the items that can be purchased there with excruciating detail. The song was originally intended to be a pastiche, or &quot;style parody&quot;, of another (unspecified) artist, but during recording sessions it evolved into an original composition. In a GQ interview, Yankovic opted not to reveal the identity of the original parodied musical artist, explaining that if he did, the factoid would end up as a Wikipedia entry.

&quot;Party at the Leper Colony&quot; is a dance song set in a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, lampooning common English idioms by taking them literally, often to a grotesque degree, as the characters with leprosy lose body parts throughout the song (e.g. &quot;Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let&#x27;s give &#x27;em a hand&quot;). &quot;Wanna B Ur Lovr&quot;, a pastiche of &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song&#x27;s title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the &quot;song is actually intended to sound like &quot;me&quot; trying to sound like &quot;Beck&quot; trying to sound like Prince&quot; [emphasis in original].

&quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot; emulates the style of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song &quot;amplifies the noxious self-absorption of the American character to hilarious extremes&quot; by describing a narrator who, upon hearing about a number of horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;: &quot;Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So he came in and knocked it out. I think that&#x27;s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad at me for that.&quot;

&quot;Bob&quot; is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song&#x27;s first line is &quot;I, man, am regal—a German am I&quot;, which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song&#x27;s lyrics &quot;sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan&#x27;s nasal whine.&quot; The album&#x27;s closer, &quot;Genius in France&quot;, emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa&#x27;s son, Dweezil performed the song&#x27;s intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.

===Parodies and polka===
On March 21, 2003, Yankovic began working on the album&#x27;s parody songs, as well as the record&#x27;s polka medley. The album opens with the parody &quot;Couch Potato&quot;, a play on Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;, the critically acclaimed single from the film &quot;8 Mile&quot; (2002). In Yankovic&#x27;s version, the singer describes his obsession with watching television; the song references many TV shows, as well as cable and network channels. Prior to recording &quot;Couch Potato&quot;, Yankovic researched television so that his resulting parody would be accurate. He noted, &quot;If I&#x27;m writing a song about TV, I&#x27;ll spend a lot of time watching TV. I&#x27;ll study &quot;TV Guide&quot;, I&#x27;ll look at articles about television, and I&#x27;ll try to make sure I&#x27;m giving every show its fair do . I can also spend all day watching TV and convince myself that I&#x27;m working, because I&#x27;m doing research.&quot;

The album&#x27;s second parody, &quot;Trash Day&quot;, is a parody of &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; by Nelly. In this song, the narrator discusses the filthiness of his house and bemoans the titular day wherein people place their garbage outside of their living quarters to be picked up by a waste collector and brought to a landfill. &quot;A Complicated Song&quot; is a spoof of &quot;Complicated&quot; by Avril Lavigne. The song is composed of three vignettes: in the first, the singer laments that he is constipated, in the second, he discovers that he and his girlfriend are related, and in the third, he expresses regret that he was recently decapitated. &quot;Ode to a Super Hero&quot; is a play on Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;Piano Man&quot;, and recounts the plot of the 2002 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film.

The album&#x27;s final parody is &quot;eBay&quot;, based on &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator describes a variety of obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, &quot;I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn&#x27;t want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I probably should have done a video because it would have been one of my biggest hits.&quot; Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic&#x27;s most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.

&quot;Angry White Boy Polka&quot;, a medley of popular hit songs set to a polka beat, was recorded at the same time as the album&#x27;s parodies. Yankovic explained, &quot;[The medley] is a reflection on what songs I think would sound most ridiculous done as a polka [...] and for the [...] album, it reflected a genre of music that I thought probably would benefit from getting a polka treatment.&quot;

==Artwork and packaging==
The cover of the CD depicts Yankovic with a poodle on his head, standing in a crowded subway car. The poodle in question was Yankovic&#x27;s own dog, Bela. Before deciding on the final shot of his poodle, Yankovic and his production crew tried a setup that featured Bela urinating on his head, but Yankovic later admitted, &quot;It was more disgusting than funny.&quot; In regards to the people standing behind him in the subway car, Yankovic specified via the &quot;Ask Al&quot; Q&amp;A on his website:

Well, let&#x27;s see... the guy with the poodle on his head would be me. The very pregnant woman with the sunglasses is my wife Suzanne. The guy in the surgical scrubs is my friend Joel Miller. The woman in the foreground with her legs crossed is my first-cousin-once-removed Tammy (who also played Queen Amidala in my video for &quot;The Saga Begins&quot;). Uh Jeff, the guy that screens my fan mail, is the guy wearing the NY Yankees cap way in the back. Steve Jay&#x27;s son Ian is the really tall blond bicycle messenger. Tracy Berna, one of the writers for &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, is the waitress with the beehive hair-do. The Boy Scout is Dylan Bostick, the oldest son of one of Suzanne&#x27;s oldest friends. Bermuda&#x27;s wife Leslie is in there too. Plus there&#x27;s my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, my electrician, a couple from my church, the owner of my favorite ice cream shop, my aunt&#x27;s boyfriend... I think we got maybe 2 or 3 people from the casting office, but the overwhelming majority were friends and family members that just wanted to come to the shoot.

The album was released on an Enhanced CD, and when the CD is placed into a computer, bonus content is made available. This content includes several of Yankovic&#x27;s real home videos and his commentary on them, as well as synchronized lyrics and instrumental or acoustic versions of some songs. A photo gallery is also included.

==Music video controversy==

A music video for &quot;Couch Potato&quot; was to be shot shortly after the album&#x27;s release, but Eminem denied Yankovic permission to shoot it. Yankovic told the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 2003: 

We were already in pre-production. We believed that it was just a formality, that Eminem just wanted to hear the final mix of the song... And then we got a phone call saying he was not going to give permission for a video. We were devastated [...] I certainly don&#x27;t have any bad feelings toward Eminem. He was gracious enough to let us use the song on the album—and we use &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; in the &quot;Angry White Boy Polka&quot; medley, too. But this is the first album I&#x27;ve ever released without an accompanying video.

According to Yankovic, Eminem worried that a parody of his video might &quot;detract from his legacy [and] that [...] would somehow make people take him less seriously as an important hip-hop artist&quot;. Musicologist Lily Hirsch noted that, while race was not mentioned by either party, the powerful visual impression of a Weird Al video could have undermined Eminem&#x27;s efforts to be seen as a serious rap artist instead of a &quot;wigger&quot;.

Yankovic was rather upset that a video for &quot;Couch Potato&quot; would not be made, as he felt that it would have been &quot;the best video that [he had] ever done&quot;. Yankovic later revealed that the video would have taken on the form of a &quot;&#x27;patchwork quilt&#x27; montage spoofing the most famous scenes from Eminem&#x27;s videos.&quot; Yankovic mocked the situation on his 2003 &quot;Al TV&quot; special where he staged a mock interview with the rapper using footage from a real Eminem interview on MTV News. Eminem said, &quot;I believe in... artistic expression.&quot; Yankovic countered with, &quot;So you think, for example if somebody wanted to do, oh, I don&#x27;t know, a parody of somebody else&#x27;s video, they should be able to... artistically express themselves and just do it?&quot; Eminem was shown at a loss for words. Eminem later discussed the mock interview in the book &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, wherein he claimed to have taken the jab in good fun:

Weird Al also got me. He made a video, did a fake interview with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, and put it up on the Internet. He&#x27;s a very funny motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have to sit back and say, &quot;Oh, he got me.&quot; It&#x27;s something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you&#x27;ve got to be able to take it.

So that the album would not be without a video, a quick one for &quot;Bob&quot; was shot, which references the promotional clip of Dylan&#x27;s song, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, which was shot for the 1967 D. A. Pennebaker documentary &quot;Dont Look Back&quot;. It was used on the tour and for the 2003 edition of &quot;Al TV&quot;. The video for &quot;Bob&quot; was subsequently released on &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection&quot; DVD (2003).

==Critical reception==

The album received mixed reviews from music critics. Evan Serpick of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; awarded the album a &quot;B&quot;. While he felt that &quot;Couch Potato&quot; was, musically, up to par with Eminem&#x27;s original, he noted, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine today&#x27;s tough tykes choosing&quot; to listen to the somewhat tame parody. Serpick also felt that the Nelly and Avril Lavigne parodies were &quot;full of noisome effects and clownish voices that would make even the widest eyes roll.&quot; He ended his review by praising the album&#x27;s polka medley, saying it &quot;exposes the songs for the pretentious rock babble they are.&quot;

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic claimed that the album was evidence that &quot;pop culture [was] ahead of Weird Al&quot;. He felt that many of songs belied an inherent misconception of youth culture on the part of Yankovic, and that with &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;, the artist was &quot;offering generalizations about a culture he doesn&#x27;t understand&quot;. But while he claimed that the record &quot;stumbles over the obviousness and awfulness of its parodies&quot;, Erlewine enjoyed &quot;Hardware Store&quot;, &quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot;, and &quot;Genius in France&quot; (for being &quot;complicated&quot; and &quot;intricate&quot;; a &quot;sensitive piano pop tune with a good send-up of narcissistic lyrics and nice, layered vocal harmonies&quot;; and &quot;the most ambitious and weirdest thing here, which counts for a lot,&quot; respectively).

The writers of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; awarded the album two stars, denoting a record that is &quot;fair to poor&quot; and that &quot;fall[s] below an artist&#x27;s established standard&quot;. A review of the album by &quot;Billboard&quot;, however, praised the album, noting that it &quot;crackles with amusing parodies&quot;, proving that Yankovic is &quot;a sharp observer of the world—and that&#x27;s what makes [him] such an enduring, compelling figure.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Poodle Hat&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. This made it his first Grammy Award win since 1988, when his video for &quot;Fat&quot; won for Best Concept Music Video. Part of the reason for this dearth of awards was because, from 1993 until 2003, the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album had been changed to &quot;Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Comedy&quot;—meaning that Yankovic&#x27;s musical comedy records were not eligible for nomination.

==Commercial performance==
Upon its release, &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; charted domestically at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also charted at number 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Internet Albums. &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; has not been certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making it one of only a handful of &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic albums to not receive the honor. Nathan Rabin, in &quot;Weird Al: The Book&quot; (2012), argues that this is because &quot;Couch Potato&quot; never had a music video, resulting in the album stumbling commercially.

Although no official singles were released from the album, the song &quot;eBay&quot; nevertheless charted at number 15 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart (which, in effect, corresponds to 115 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart).

In late 2013, Yankovic sued his label, Volcano, and its parent company, Sony Music, for unpaid publishing royalties from several of his albums and singles, including &quot;Poodle Hat&quot;. Yankovic claimed thatdespite the album&#x27;s successhe never earned royalties from the record. The initial lawsuit was for $5 million; Yankovic won the lawsuit and was awarded an undisclosed sum of money from Sony.

<text>Slivovitz is a fruit spirit (or fruit brandy) made from damson plums, often referred to as plum spirit (or plum brandy). Slivovitz is produced in Central and Southeastern Europe, both commercially and privately. Primary producers include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Greece, Hungary, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. In the Balkans, slivovitz is considered a kind of &quot;rakia&quot;. In Hungary it is considered a kind of pálinka, but in Romania and Moldova it is considered pălincă, similar to țuică. In Czechia, Slovakia, Galicia, and Carpathian-Ruthenia it is considered Pálenka. UNESCO put it in a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists in 2022 on request of the country of geographic origin Serbia.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;slivovitz&quot; derives from Proto-Slavic &#x27;plum&#x27; (, or &quot;slíva&quot;, , /шљива, or ) with the diminutive suffix (; &quot;-ice&quot; in Czech). Distilled spirits from different fruits are named similarly. For example, Czech &#x27;apricot&#x27; → &#x27;apricot spirit&#x27;; &#x27;peach&#x27; → &#x27;peach spirit&#x27;. Other names include slivovitza, slivovitsa, șliboviță, šljivovica, śliwowica, Schlivowitz, slivovice, slivovica, or slivovka.

==Production and consumption==
The primary producers are Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia.

===Regional names===
Following the claims of several nations to the protected designation of origin, in October 2007 the European Union went for a compromise solution, leaving &quot;slivovitz&quot; as a generic name, and granting individual nations the right to protect the origin with their own adjective.

In respective languages, &quot;slivovitz&quot; () is known as: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , шљивовица; ; ; ; and .

Identical or similar spirits are also produced in Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, the United States, and regional names include generic &quot;plum spirit&quot;, &quot;Pflümli&quot;, &quot;Damassine&quot; or &quot;eau-de-vie de &quot;.

===Distilling process===
Only Damson plums may be used as the base fruit for distillation. Before the production process, the plums may be slightly pressed or otherwise disrupted to speed up the fermentation process, but without damaging their ground kernels; yeast, starch, and sugar may be added to the juice. The mixture is then allowed to ferment. There may be one or more distillation stages, depending on the desired final product or region of production, and aging is common to enhance the distillate&#x27;s finer flavours.

Some producers have obtained a Hechsher certifying that it is kosher for Passover, and thus suitable for consumption during the festival when grain-based liquors are forbidden.

Some modern production techniques, such as those used by Clear Creek in Oregon, omit the use of the pits in fermentation to create a less acerbic or bitter taste.

Imitation slivovitz is made by flavouring spirits with prune juice and artificial oil of bitter almonds.

==History, by country==
===Bulgaria===
In Bulgaria, the &quot;Troyan plum spirit&quot; (Troyanska Slivova) has been distilled in the Troyan Monastery by the monks since the founding of the monastery in the 14th century. The original recipe included 40 herbs, and was passed through the centuries from abbot to abbot. In 1894, the Monastery&#x27;s spirit was presented at a spirits competition in Antwerp, Belgium, where it won a bronze medal. Some of its distinguishing characteristics include that it is made of a plum variety that only grows in the Troyan region, an old variety the locals call &quot;Madzharkini plums&quot;, very juicy and aromatic whose stone, unlike the Teteven plums, is easily removed from the fruit; it is distilled in a vessel with a capacity of 80 to 120 litres; and only the best of the harvest is distilled. It is considered best distilled to an alcohol level between 39 and 41 degrees. Some celebrities who have tasted Troyan plum spirit are Pope John Paul II and former US President Bill Clinton. Patriarch Maxim of Bulgaria celebrated his 95th birthday in 2009 in the Sofia Metropolitanate with Troyan plum spirit.

In 2007, in cooperation with the Bulgarian government, the Czech distillery &quot;Rudolf Jelinek&quot; protected the brands &quot;Troyanska slivova&quot; and &quot;Tetevenska slivova&quot; in the EU. That same year, this distillery, the largest European manufacturer of fruit distillates, bought a majority share in the largest Bulgarian slivovitsa vinery &quot;Vinprom-Troyan&quot;, after having bought, half a year earlier, the second largest &quot;Destila Teteven&quot;. However, the Czechs reduced the alcohol content to pay less duty. The production of &quot;Vinprom-Troyan&quot; is mainly for export. For the past 18 years, Troyan has had a special holiday: &quot;The Festival of Plum&quot;. This holiday is celebrated at the end of September in Troyan and in the village of Oreshak, where the Troyan Monastery is located. The plum has always been an essential produce in this region. Since the beginning of the 20th century, plums have been made into marmalades, pesto, dried prunes, and pulps, all of which were exported into Western Europe.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia &quot;slivovice&quot;, or &quot; slivovica&quot;, respectively (as well as other fruit-based distilled alcoholic drinks) due to the somewhat symbolic status of the Moravian &quot;national&quot; drink is strongly presented in local traditions, culture and pop culture like in proverbs, songs, TV shows and movies.

&quot;Slivovice&quot; is primarily produced in the southern and eastern provinces of Moravia and in Vysočina, where the country retains its rural character. Although not legal, traditional moonshine home distilleries are very common across the Moravian countryside, nonetheless, the majority of private production moved to certified local community-owned distilleries to prevent errors during the distillation process (leading to concentration of toxic methanol). Certified production also allows state authorities to collect respective taxes (based on the proof of the alcohol in the final product), however tax-reliefs for limited private and non-commercial production of the drink exist. The usual proof of private-produced &quot;slivovice&quot; is over 50% of alcohol in the final product, commercially available mass-produced slivovice is proofed less.

&quot;Slivovice&quot; is mostly served in small shot glass known locally as &quot;panák&quot; (literally: a dummy),&quot;baňa&quot; (variation of the word shot/bang in dialects of southeastern Moravia), &quot;&quot;kalíšek&quot; (colloquial for a small cup) or &quot;&quot;štamprle&quot; (from German &quot;&quot;das Stamperl&quot;, a little glass). Keeping slivovice cold helps to reduce the effects of high proof or not ideal taste; however, the drink is not to be served on the rocks. The only accurate way to drink slivovice is a shot glass. To enjoy the aroma and taste of the original fruit it is better and more common to drink &quot;slivovice&quot; served at room temperature.

===Poland===
The mountainous region of southern Poland has a long tradition of making slivovitz. Historically it has been distilled by local Goral highlanders and not necessarily given any particular brand names. One of the more recognised of such products is Śliwowica łącka associated with the town of Łącko. However, due to the fact that it is made without any specific control and brand ownership it has declined in quality, especially in recent years.

Slivovitz was also distilled in large quantities by the Jewish community of Poland before the Second World War. As a popular Passover alcohol, slivovitz had a strong standing among the traditional Jewish-Orthodox communities. State-owned distillers tried to reintroduce the slivovitz based on Jewish traditions in the form of &quot;Pejsachówka&quot;. After 1989, Pejsachówka had disappeared from the market. Polish distillers continue to produce Śliwowica Paschalna and Śliwowica Strykowska (Strykover Slivovitz), which are both certified as kosher.

===Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia and Slovenia===
Šljivovica (, ) is the national drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and the plum is the national fruit. Šljivovica has a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO).
Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and are a part of numerous traditional customs. A Serbian meal sometimes starts or ends with plum products and šljivovica is served as an apéritif. A saying goes that the best place to build a house is where a plum tree grows the best. Traditionally, šljivovica (commonly referred to as &quot;rakija&quot;) is connected to a Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.). It is used in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration, Slava. It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of Šumadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and šljivovica. In 2004, over 400 000 litres of šljivovica was produced in Serbia. In 2017, Serbia was the 5th largest producer of plums and sloes in the world.

After legal disputes, following the compromise of 2007 &quot;Serbian Slivovitz&quot; ( / &quot;Srpska šljivovica&quot;) became Serbia&#x27;s first certified national brand.

Šljivovica is consumed either directly from a leather-wrapped round bottle, or chilled in a shot glass called &quot;čokanjčić&quot; (plural: &quot;čokanjčići&quot;). There is also a town in Zlatibor, called Šljivovica. A popular print in Serbia depicts a moustached peasant wearing the &quot;šubara&quot; (fur hat), drinking šljivovica from a leather-wrapped bottle, with the motto: &quot;Fuck the Coca, fuck the pizza, all we need is šljivovica&quot;.

In 2021, Serbia&#x27;s šljivovica was added to the United Nations Intangible Cultural Heritage List as a &quot;cherished tradition to be preserved by humanity&quot;.

In Slovenia it is known as &quot;slivovka&quot;.

<text>Redistricting in the United States is the process of drawing electoral district boundaries. For the United States House of Representatives, and state legislatures, redistricting occurs after each ten-year census.

The U.S. Constitution in Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 provides for proportional representation in the House of Representatives. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 required that the number of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives be kept at a constant 435, and a 1941 act made the reapportionment among the states by population automatic after every decennial census. Reapportionment occurs at the federal level followed by redistricting at the state level. According to , Article I, Section 4 left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish congressional districts; however, such decisions are subject to judicial review. In most states redistricting is subject to political maneuvering, but some state legislatures have created independent commissions.

The Uniform Congressional District Act (enacted in 1967) requires that representatives be elected from single-member districts. When a state has a single representative, that district will be state-wide.

Gerrymandering in the redistricting process has been a problem since the early days of the republic. In recent years, critics have argued that redistricting has been used to neutralize minority voting power. Supporters say it enhances electoral competitiveness.

==Legislative representatives==
===Federal===


Six states have a single representative in the United States House of Representatives, because of their low populations. These are Alaska, Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. These states do not need redistricting for the House and elect members on a state-wide at-large basis.

In 25 states, the state legislature has primary responsibility for creating a redistricting plan, in many cases subject to approval by the state governor. To reduce the role that legislative politics might play, thirteen states (Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington) determine congressional redistricting by an independent or bipartisan redistricting commission. Five states: Maine, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia give independent bodies authority to propose redistricting plans, but preserve the role of legislatures to approve them. Arkansas has a commission composed of its governor, attorney general, and secretary of state.

By law, the forty-four states with more than one representative must redistrict after each decennial census to account for population shifts within the state as well as (when necessary) to add or remove congressional districts. Federal law (including the Constitution) does not prevent states from redistricting at any time between censuses, up to and including redistricting prior to each congressional election, provided such redistricting conforms to various federal laws. However, &quot;mid-decade&quot; redistricting proposals (such as what occurred in 2003 in Texas) have typically been highly controversial. Because of this, many states prohibit mid-decade redistricting, although this is more prevalent for state legislative redistricting than for congressional redistricting. Some also link it to a specific year or to the decennial census. It is unclear to what extent mid-decade redistricting would be legal in those states.

Apart from mid-decade redistricting initiated by state legislatures (as happened in Texas), both federal and state courts can also order the redistricting of certain maps between-censuses (because said maps were ruled unconstitutional or against federal law, for example). Examples of this are the redistricting that occurred between the 2016 and 2018 elections in Pennsylvania or the redistricting that occurred in North Carolina.

===State===
State constitutions and laws also mandate which body has responsibility over drawing the state legislature boundaries. In addition, those municipal governments that are elected on a district basis (as opposed to an at-large basis) also redistrict.

===Redistricting criteria===
The Reapportionment Act of 1929 did not state any size and population requirements for congressional districts, last stated in the Apportionment Act of 1911, since the 1911 Act was still in force. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the 1911 Act was no longer in force even though Congress never repealed it. The previous apportionment acts required districts be contiguous, compact, and equally populated.

Each state can set its own standards for congressional and legislative districts. In addition to equalizing the population of districts and complying with federal requirements, criteria may include attempting to create compact, contiguous districts, trying to keep political units and communities within a single district, and avoiding the drawing of boundaries for purposes of partisan advantage or incumbent protection.

Redistricting may follow other criteria depending on state and local laws:
# compactness
# contiguity
# equal population
# preservation of existing political communities
# partisan fairness
# racial fairness

==Gerrymandering==

Gerrymandering, the practice of drawing district boundaries to achieve political advantage for legislators, involves the manipulation of district boundaries to leave out, or include, specific populations in a particular district to ensure a legislator&#x27;s reelection or to advantage their party.

In states where the legislature (or another body where a partisan majority is possible) is in charge of redistricting, the possibility of gerrymandering (the deliberate manipulation of political boundaries for electoral advantage, usually of incumbents or a specific political party) often makes the process very politically contentious, especially when the majorities of the two houses of the legislature, or the legislature and the governor, are from different parties.

Partisan domination of state legislatures and improved technology to design contiguous districts that pack opponents into as few districts as possible have led to district maps which are skewed towards one party. Consequently, many states including Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Wisconsin have succeeded in reducing or effectively eliminating competition for most House seats in those states. Some states, including New Jersey and New York, protect incumbents of both parties, reducing the number of competitive districts.

The state and federal court systems are often involved in resolving disputes over congressional and legislative redistricting when gridlock prevents redistricting in a timely manner. In addition, those disadvantaged by a proposed redistricting plan may challenge it in state and federal courts. Justice Department approval (which is known as pre-clearance) was formerly required under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in certain states that have had a history of racial barriers to voting. The Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on the Pennsylvania redistricting effectively allows elected officials to select their constituents by eliminating most of the grounds for constituents to challenge district lines.

== Other redistricting reforms ==
In addition to the establishments of redistricting commissions in multiple states, proposals have been fielded to draft interstate compacts between states on congressional redistricting. These have been proposed in the legislatures of Maryland and Illinois since the 2010s in order to reduce redistricting-related litigation, prevent partisan &quot;arms races&quot; over reapportionment and partisan gerrymandering, and reduce perceptions of nonpartisan redistricting as unilateral disarmament. To date, no such compacts have been approved by legislature or referendum.

<doc id="667114" wikidata="Q648194" url="?curid=667114" title="Euribor">
<text>The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) is a daily reference rate, published by the European Money Markets Institute, based on the averaged interest rates at which Eurozone banks borrow unsecured funds from counterparties in the euro wholesale money market (before only in the interbank market). Prior to 2015, the rate was published by the European Banking Federation.

==Scope==
Euribors are used as a reference rate for euro-denominated forward rate agreements, short-term interest rate futures contracts and interest rate swaps, in very much the same way as LIBORs are commonly used for Sterling and US dollar-denominated instruments. They thus provide the basis for some of the world&#x27;s most liquid and active interest rate markets.

Domestic reference rates, like Paris&#x27;s PIBOR, Frankfurt&#x27;s FIBOR, and Helsinki&#x27;s Helibor merged into Euribor on EMU day on 1 January 1999.

Euribor should be distinguished from the less commonly used &quot;Euro LIBOR&quot; rates set in London by 16 major banks.

== Fallback ==

The EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011) requires entities that use a benchmark to have robust plans in place to manage the possibility of a benchmark undergoing substantial changes or ceasing to exist. Where feasible and appropriate, such plans should nominate one or more fallback rates.

To facilitate the drafting of such plans for entities using Euribor® rates, the European Money Markets Institute has developed Efterm, a forward-looking fallback rate based on available market data related to Dealer-to-Dealer and Dealer-to-Client OIS Swaps and futures that reference the European Central Bank&#x27;s Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR).

==Technical features==
:&quot;Official reference: EURIBOR Technical features&quot;
A representative panel of banks provide daily quotes of the rate, rounded to two decimal places, that each Panel Bank believes one prime bank is quoting to another prime bank for interbank term deposits within the Euro zone, for maturity ranging from one week to one year. Every Panel Bank is required to directly input its data no later than 11:00 a.m. (CET) on each day that the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross-Settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET) is open. At 11:02 a.m. (CET), GRSS (Global Rate Set Systems) will instantaneously publish the reference rate on Refinitiv (ex. Reuters), Bloomberg and a number of other information providers which will then be made available to all their subscribers.
The published rate is a rounded, truncated mean of the quoted rates: the highest and lowest 15% of quotes are eliminated, the remainder are averaged and the result is rounded to 3 decimal places.
Euribor rates are &quot;spot&quot; rates, i.e. for a start two working days after measurement day. Like US money-market rates, they are &quot;Actual/360&quot;, i.e. calculated with an exact daycount over a 360-day year.
Euribor was first published on 30 December 1998 for value 4 January 1999.

==Panel banks==

===Current banks===

===Former banks===
==Euribor-based derivatives==

===Euribor futures===
EUR Euribor futures are traded on Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and on Eurex.

They were previously also traded on CurveGlobal, part of the London Stock Exchange Group, which has closed down operations in January 2022.

===Interest rate swaps===
Interest rate swaps based on Euribor rates currently trade in money markets for maturities up to 50 years. A &quot;five-year Euribor&quot; will be in fact referring to the 5-year swap rate vs 6-month Euribor. &quot;Euribor + &quot;x&quot; basis points&quot;, when talking about a bond, will mean that the bond&#x27;s cash flows have to be discounted on the swaps&#x27; zero-coupon yield curve shifted by &quot;x&quot; basis points in order to equal the bond&#x27;s actual market price.

==€STR==
The other widely used reference rate in the euro-zone is €STR, published by the European Central Bank.

<text>Eonia (Euro Overnight Index Average) was computed as a weighted average of all overnight unsecured lending transactions in the interbank market, undertaken in the European Union and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries by a Panel of banks (the same as for Euribor) subject to the Eonia Code of Conduct.

It was reported on an ACT/360 day count convention and displayed to three decimal places. &quot;Overnight&quot; means from one TARGET day (i.e. day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system is open) to the next.

&quot;Eonia reference rates&quot; were calculated by the European Central Bank, based on all overnight interbank assets created before the close of RTGS systems at 6pm CET, and published through GRSS (Global Rate Set Systems) every day before 7pm CET. It can be found under the ISIN identifier EU0009659945.

EONIA was replaced by the Euro Short-Term Rate (€STR), published by the ECB since 2nd of October 2019.

<doc id="667124" wikidata="Q5128310" url="?curid=667124" title="Classical Prose Movement">
<text>The Classical Prose Movement (), which emerged during Tang dynasty and the Song dynasty in China, advocated for clarity and precision in writing, as opposed to the florid &quot;pianwen&quot; () or parallel prose style that had dominated since the Han dynasty. Parallel prose was characterized by a rigid structure and came to be criticized for being overly ornate at the expense of content.

The goal of the classical prose stylists was to capture the spirit of pre-Han prose, allowing for the free expression of ideas and effective communication. They incorporated elements of colloquial language to make their writings more direct and accessible. The movement also had political and religious aspects, as Confucian scholars tried to combat the influence of Taoism and Buddhism on the imperial court and among the commoners. Additionally, some proponents viewed it as an effective tool to expose the reality of corruption and weakness in the central government.

The most distinguished writers of the Classical Prose Movement were known as the Eight Masters of the Tang and Song.

== Tang Dynasty ==

Parallel prose initiated in the Pre-Qin era, flourished during the Southern and Northern dynasties, and reached its peak in the early Tang dynasty. However, the excessive elaboration of its rules, vocabulary, and allusions became a hindrance to effective communication. Therefore, classical prose in a less restrained format became high in demand. 

Another motivation for writing style revolution was triggered by the social-political turmoil following the An Lushan Rebellion. Reform-minded literati-officials seek to repair and renew the empire that suffered multiple crisis including a weak central government plagued by regional warlords, corrupted bureaucrats, poverty of the commoners, and prevalent practice of Buddhism and Taoism which weakened the economy. They believe that the tool of revival was the knowledge and practical application of classical Confucian ideologies, with prose writing serving as the vehicle for the reformist message.

The first distinguished stylists of the movement were Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan of the ninth-century, who were not only accomplished writers but also eminent theorists, providing the foundation of the movement. Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan established several principles for prose writing. They believed that prose writing should serve as a vehicle for expressing ideas and arguments effectively, rather than merely showcasing rhetorical skill. Additionally, they encouraged writers to study the classics extensively, not only the Confucian classics but also literary texts from other philosophers and authors, to enrich their content and form. While they valued the study of classical works, they also emphasized the importance of innovation, advising against mechanical imitation of the classics. Furthermore, they believed that authors should cultivate their inner selves, allowing their writings to be infused with character and emotion. 

Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan were prolific prose writers who collectively produced around 800 works spanning a wide range of genres, including political essays, letters, petitions, prefaces, biographies, eulogies, epitaphs, fables, travelogues, and novellas. Han Yu&#x27;s prose works feature innovative vocabulary, concise and vivid expressions, sharp commentary, and compelling arguments. His writing is rich with emotion and personal characters, flowing like rushing rapids. Liu Zongyuan was best known for his landscape travelogues, in which he rediscovered natural scenery overlooked by the masses. Through his poetic lens, ordinary landscapes were reimagined and transformed by his expressive writing.

After the deaths of Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan, the Classical Prose Movement experienced a decline. Some of their students adopted archaic language that hindered comprehension, while others neglected the importance of crafting well-structured essays. By the late Tang dynasty, the reformist spirit had diminished among scholars, and pianwen (parallel prose) regained prominence as the predominant literary style.

Furthermore, the government only allowed the use of &quot;pianwen&quot; for official use, so those who want to be officials had to learn that style. 

== Song dynasty ==
The theme was revisited by Song dynasty scholar official Fan Zhongyan, as part of the political and social reform initiatives he advocated for. The Confucian reformers held that prose writing, particularly writings required for civil service examinations, shall focus on statecraft and Confucian Classics, instead of euphonious composition. Fan&#x27;s promotion of the &quot;ancient style&quot; served both political and ethical grounds, as he believed scholar officials with moral cultivation and administrative skills will improve government efficiency and commoner&#x27;s lives. As such, the lettered class shall shift their focus from floridity to the substance of what they write. 

Ouyang Xiu, a younger associate and avid follower of Fan Zhongyan, developed into a literary giant and leader in reviving the ancient style. Ouyang and his literary friends carried over the spirit of classical prose to poetry, and further to a larger effort to reform writing and learning in general, so that writing would be a vehicle for purpose and reflection, rather than a display of talent. Ouyang followed the Tang pioneers Han Yu and Liu Zongyuan for their &quot;talents&quot; and &quot;natural flow&quot; in prose writing, but skipped the &quot;obscure&quot; and &quot;strange&quot; elements contained in their prose work. In his own unofficial writing practice of letters, prefaces, accounts, and grave inscriptions, Ouyang &quot;cultivated a highly personal tone&quot; and incorporated an extensive range of &quot;subjects, moods, and themes&quot;. To &quot;write naturally&quot; was a piece of advice he offered to younger writers, and the principle he followed through in his prose creation.

As a policy maker, Ouyang was well known for his directives in the 1057 imperial examination, where candidates writing in the ancient prose style were selected over candidates using the euphuistic or Imperial Academy style. Several of the passing candidates would turn into prominent literary figures, including Su Shi, Su Xun, and Zeng Gong.

<text>Limonium is a genus of about 600 flowering plant species. Members are also known as sea-lavender, statice, caspia or marsh-rosemary. Despite their common names, species are not related to the lavenders or to rosemary. They are instead in Plumbaginaceae, the plumbago or leadwort family.
The generic name is from the Latin &#x27;, used by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] for a wild plant and is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek&#x27; (, &#x27;meadow&#x27;).

==Distribution==
The genus has a subcosmopolitan distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, North America and Australia. By far the greatest diversity (over 100 species) is in the area stretching from the Canary Islands east through the Mediterranean region to central Asia; for comparison, North America only has three native &quot;Limonium&quot; species.

==Description==
Sea-lavenders normally grow as herbaceous perennial plants, growing 10–70 cm tall from a rhizome; a few (mainly from the Canary Islands) are woody shrubs up to 2 metres tall. Many species flourish in saline soils, and are therefore common near coasts and in salt marshes, and also on saline, gypsum and alkaline soils in continental interiors.

The leaves are simple, entire to lobed, and from 1–30 cm long and 0.5–10 cm broad; most of the leaves are produced in a dense basal rosette, with the flowering stems bearing only small brown scale-leaves (bracts). The flowers are produced on a branched panicle or corymb, the individual flowers are small (4–10 mm long) with a five-lobed calyx and corolla, and five stamens; the flower colour is pink or violet to purple in most species, white or yellow in a few. Many of the species are apomictic. The fruit is a small capsule containing a single seed, partly enclosed by the persistent calyx.

==Features==
Several species are popular garden flowers; they are generally known to gardeners as &quot;statices&quot;. They are grown both for their flowers and for the appearance of the calyx, which remains on the plant after the true flowers have fallen, and are known as &quot;everlasting flowers&quot;.

==Species==

There are about 600 species in the genus, many of them local endemic species with a very restricted range. Species not given a common name here are generally referred to simply as &quot;sea-lavender&quot;, &quot;statice,&quot; or &quot;marsh-rosemary&quot;.

<text>The Mullica River is a river in southern New Jersey in the United States. The Mullica was once known as the &quot;Little Egg Harbor River&quot;.

The river provides one of the principal drainages into the Atlantic Ocean of the extensive Pinelands. Its estuary on Great Bay is considered one of the least-disturbed marine wetlands habitats in the northeastern United States.

In 2022, the Mullica River Fire consumed an estimated of the related Wharton State Forest.

== Course ==
The Mullica rises in central Camden County, near Berlin, on the southeastern fringes of the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia. It flows generally east-southeast across the state, crossing the Wharton State Forest and forming most of the boundary between Atlantic and Burlington County. Near The Forks, where it receives the Batsto River, the Mullica broadens into a navigable river approximately long, stretching east-southeast and emptying into Great Bay approximately north of Atlantic City. It becomes brackish below the bridge at Green Bank. Approximately upstream from its mouth on Great Bay, it receives the estuary of the Wading River from the north. Approximately upstream from its mouth, it receives the Bass River from the north. The watershed drained by the river and its tributaries measures approximately 568 square miles, and is composed primarily of pine forests and scrub habitat.

The estuary is crossed by the Garden State Parkway and US 9 near its mouth. The lower reaches of the river form an extensive wetlands area, which is protected on its southern bank as the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge.

== Wildlife ==
The Mullica River is noted as a spawning ground for striped bass. Blueback herring make a spring spawning run up the river and its tributaries. Freshwater portions are also home to healthy populations of white catfish, pickerel, white perch, crappie, white sucker, and largemouth bass. Brackish and saltwater portions of the river are inhabited by weakfish, winter flounder, bluefish, American eel, and summer flounder. Blue claw crabs are prevalent in the lower reaches of the river and in tributaries flowing through the surrounding salt marshes. These tidal creeks also support populations of the northern diamondback terrapin, which is listed by the federal government as a species of special concern.

The river also provides a habitat for a broad assortment of nesting and migratory birds. Species of note include the common tern, black skimmer, laughing gull, piping plover, least tern, great black-backed gull, osprey, great egret, black-crowned night heron, clapper rail, Virginia rail, merlin, and marsh wren, among others. Canada geese, American black ducks, mallards, tundra swans, northern pintails, and other migratory birds are often observed in the river estuary.

== Name ==
The river is named after Eric Pålsson Mullica, early Swedish settler (with Finnish ancestry) born in 1636 who founded a homestead on the river after moving there from the vicinity of Philadelphia. The settlement was located about 15 miles (24 km) upstream from the mouth near present-day Lower Bank. For many years it was known as the Little Egg Harbor River (&#x27;Little&#x27; to disambiguate it from the Great Egg Harbor River to its south); before European colonization, the Lenape called it the Amintonck.

<text>Criminal Law is a 1988 American legal thriller film directed by Martin Campbell and starring Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon. It received generally negative reviews.

==Plot==
Gary Oldman plays Ben Chase, a young defense attorney whose success is built on his willingness to manipulate the judicial system for the benefit of his clients. In spite of his career success as an attorney, Ben is starting to show signs of serious alcoholism. When he successfully defends Martin Thiel, the scion of a wealthy, prominent family, against a murder charge, the game turns on him.
Martin lures Ben to the scene of another murder and retains Ben to defend him, even before he is charged. Knowing his client is guilty, Ben struggles at last with the reality of his ethics, until he resolves to oppose Martin secretly, hoping he will incriminate himself.

As Martin&#x27;s ultimate plan unfolds, both he and Ben will be forced to reexamine everything they hold to be true.

==Cast==
* Gary Oldman as Ben Chase
* Kevin Bacon as Martin Thiel
* Tess Harper as Lt. Detective Jean Stillwell
* Karen Young as Ellen Falkner
* Joe Don Baker as Detective Carl Mesel
* Sean McCann as Jacob Fischer
* Ron Lea as Gary Hull
* Michael Sinelnikoff as Professor Clemens
* Elizabeth Shepherd as Dr. Sybil Thiel

==Reception==
Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;&quot;Criminal Law&quot; is a textbook example of a movie going wrong before our very eyes, because of the curious failure of the filmmakers to realize that you can toy with an audience only so long before the audience grows resentful... It&#x27;s a shame such good performances were lost by the runaway use of gimmicks.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; commended the work of Oldman and Bacon, but criticized the story&#x27;s &quot;ill-defined pretensions as an essay on the American legal system and a herky-jerky continuity that&#x27;s fatiguing instead of tingling&quot;.

Kevin Thomas felt that &quot;Criminal Law&quot; &quot;proceeds from one weakness to another&quot;, but described Oldman as &quot;electrifying&quot;.

Peter Travers was less impressed by Oldman&#x27;s performance, writing: &quot;Oldman is a powerhouse. Just catch him in &quot;Sid and Nancy&quot; or &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;. But what&#x27;s a British actor doing playing a Harvard attorney in a Boston-based movie shot in Montreal? Flailing about like a drowning man, that&#x27;s what. Oldman&#x27;s [accent is] laughably in-and-out.&quot; He had additional criticism for the film&#x27;s &quot;overwrought script&quot; and lack of logic and subtlety.

Slightly more favorable was Linda Rasmussen of AllMovie, who wrote that Oldman &quot;gives an excellent performance&quot;, described Bacon as &quot;intriguing and ambiguous&quot;, and praised the direction and action sequences. She concluded: &quot;&quot;Criminal Law&quot;, if not taken very seriously and with more than a grain of salt, can be entertaining, but it fails miserably when compared to accurate, exciting legal thrillers such as &quot;Primal Fear&quot;.
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 33% based on reviews from 9 critics, with an average score of 4.6/10.

==Controversy==
Canadian serial killer Paul Bernardo, nicknamed “The Schoolgirl Killer” by the press and one of Canada&#x27;s worst violent offenders, wanted to change his surname and that of his ex-wife and then-accomplice Karla Homolka to Thiel, after the film&#x27;s primary antagonist.

<text>Shortening is any fat that is a solid at room temperature and is used to make crumbly pastry and other food products.
The idea of shortening dates back to at least the 18th century, well before the invention of modern, shelf-stable vegetable shortening. In the earlier centuries, lard was the primary ingredient used to shorten dough. The reason it is called shortening is that it makes the resulting food crumbly, or to behave as if it had short fibers. Solid fat prevents cross-linking between gluten molecules. This cross-linking would give dough elasticity, so it could be stretched into longer pieces. In pastries such as cake, which should not be elastic, shortening is used to produce the desired texture.

==History and market==

Originally shortening was synonymous with lard, but with the invention of margarine from beef tallow by French chemist Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès in 1869, margarine also came to be included in the term. Since the invention of hydrogenated vegetable oil in the early 20th century, &quot;shortening&quot; has come almost exclusively to mean hydrogenated vegetable oil. Modern margarine is made mainly of refined seed oil and water, and may also contain milk. Vegetable shortening shares many properties with lard: both are semi-solid fats with a higher smoke point than butter and margarine. They contain less water and are thus less prone to splattering, making them safer for frying. Lard and shortening have a higher fat content compared to about 80% for butter and margarine. Cake margarines and shortenings tend to contain a few percent of monoglycerides whereas other margarines typically have less. Such &quot;high ratio shortenings&quot; blend better with hydrophilic ingredients such as starches and sugar.

Hydrogenation of organic substances was first developed by the French chemist Paul Sabatier in 1897, and in 1901 the German chemist Wilhelm Normann developed the hydrogenation of fats, which he patented in 1902. In 1907, a German chemist, Edwin Cuno Kayser, moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, the home town of soap manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble. He had worked for British soap manufacturer Joseph Crosfield and Sons and was well acquainted with Normann&#x27;s process, as Crosfield and Sons owned the British rights to Normann&#x27;s patent. Soon after arriving, Kayser made a business deal with Procter &amp; Gamble, and presented the company with two processes to hydrogenate cottonseed oil, with the intent of creating a raw material for soap. Another inventor by the name of Wallace McCaw in Macon, Georgia also played a role in the invention of shortening. In 1905 McCaw patented a process in which he could turn inexpensive and commercially useless cottonseeds into imitation lard and soap. Later in 1909, Procter &amp; Gamble hired McCaw and purchased his patents along with the patents of other scientists working on partial hydrogenation which later helped in the development of &quot;shortening&quot;. Since the product looked like lard, Procter &amp; Gamble instead began selling it as a vegetable fat for cooking purposes in June 1911, calling it &quot;Crisco&quot;, a modification of the phrase &quot;crystallized cottonseed oil&quot;.
While similar to lard, vegetable shortening was much cheaper to produce. Shortening also required no refrigeration, which further lowered its costs and increased its appeal in a time when refrigerators were rare. Shortening was also more neutral in flavor than butter and lard which gave it a unique advantage when cooking. With these advantages, plus an intensive advertisement campaign by Procter &amp; Gamble, Crisco quickly gained popularity in American households. The company targeted mothers by presenting shortening as a more economical and cleaner way of preparing meals. Procter &amp; Gamble played into the neutral flavor of shortening as well as the high smoke point. As a result, they claimed that the natural flavors of the meal would shine through and be free of black particles and unruly smells common with other fats. Procter &amp; Gamble also advertised how economical it was to use shortening, often advertising cheap recipes incorporating shortening to appeal to frugal mothers. As food production became increasingly industrialized and manufacturers sought low-cost raw materials, the use of vegetable shortening also became common in the food industry. In addition, vast US government-financed surpluses of cottonseed oil, corn oil, and soybeans also helped create a market in low-cost vegetable shortening.

Crisco, owned by The J.M. Smucker Company since 2002, remains the best-known brand of shortening in the US, nowadays consisting of a blend of partially and fully hydrogenated soybean and palm oils. In Ireland and the UK, Trex is a popular brand, while in Australia, Copha is popular, made primarily from coconut oil.

==Shortened dough==
A short dough is one that is crumbly or mealy. The opposite of a short dough is a &quot;long&quot; dough, one that stretches.

Vegetable shortening (or butter, or other solid fats) can produce both types of dough; the difference is in technique. To produce a short dough, which is commonly used for tarts, the shortening is cut into the flour with a food processor, a pastry blender, a pair of table knives, fingers, or other utensil until the resulting mixture has a fine, cornmeal-like texture. For a long dough, the shortening is cut in only until the pea-sized crumbs are formed, or even larger lumps may be included. After cutting in the fat, the liquid (if any) is added and the dough is shaped for baking.

Neither short dough nor long flake dough are considered to be creamed or stirred batters.

==Health concerns and reformulation==
In the early 21st century, vegetable shortening became the subject of some health concerns due to its traditional formulation from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils that contain trans fat, a type not found in significant amounts in any naturally occurring food, that have been linked to a number of adverse health effects. Consequently, a low trans fat variant of US brand Crisco was introduced in 2004. In January 2007, all Crisco products were reformulated to contain less than one gram of trans fat per serving, and the separately marketed trans-fat-free version introduced in 2004 was consequently discontinued. In 2018, the FDA issued a ban on partially hydrogenated oils, forcing Procter &amp; Gamble to reformulate their shortening. As of October 2024 Crisco contains fully hydrogenated palm oil instead of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in order to comply with FDA regulations. However, fully hydrogenated oils are hard and waxy which has resulted in Crisco mixing their shortening with soybean oils as well as more palm oil. As a result, the new Crisco formula which is heavily dependent upon palm oil is controversial due to the environmental impact of palm oil on rainforests as large areas of rainforest must be cleared. In 2006, UK brand Cookeen was also reformulated to remove trans fats.

Instead of using fully hydrogenated oils to replace partially hydrogenated oils in food, a possible alternative could be the use of plant sterols, as highlighted by the work of Prof J Ralph Blanchfield. His research in food science indicates that plant sterols could be used in products like shortening to lower the risk of coronary heart disease by inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol in the small intestine.

<doc id="667159" wikidata="Q3504500" url="?curid=667159" title="E. K. Nayanar">
<text>Erambala Krishnan Nayanar (9 December 191919 May 2004) was an Indian politician who served as the 9th chief minister of Kerala from 1980 to 1981, 1987 to 1991 and again from 1996 to 2001. He served in that position for a total of 10 years, 11 months and 22 days, thus making him the longest-served Chief Minister of Kerala. He was a senior leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

== Early life ==
Nayanar was born in an aristocratic Nair family in Kalliasseri, Kannur district on 9 December 1919, as the second son of Govindan Nambiar and Narayani Amma. Despite his father, Govindan Nambiar, being a believer in the feudalism, Nayanar took to the national movement of the time at a very young age under the influence of his cousin, K.P.R. Gopalan. Nayanar was influenced by the events following the admission of a Dalit girl to local school under the leadership of K.P.R. Gopalan. Nayanar was a participant in student movements in the Malabar region as a part of Balasangham and consequently dropped out of school. He also faced severe opposition from his father. He was drawn towards the socialist ideology guided by leaders like P. Krishna Pillai. Nayanar famously helped in the establishment of a library and named it Shri Harshan Library, after Harshan, a member of the oppressed caste who was tortured to death at the Kannur Central Jail for his participation in the national movement.

==Political life==
=== Pre-Independence ===
Nayanar was an Indian National Congress member then he joined the Communist Party of India in 1939 at the age of 20. As a youth leader, Nayanar organized several movements. He led the forty-six-day-long Aaron Mill workers&#x27; protest against the dismissal of thirty workers by the mill management in 1940. He was jailed for six months as a consequence. Nayanar was one of the organizers of Morazha rally on 15 September 1940 in protest of rising prices. Two policemen were killed in the rally and Nayanar went into hiding for six years without knowing that he was not one of the accused. He also organized peasant uprisings in Kayyur. A policeman was stoned by protesters and subsequently died in Kayyur. Communist leaders were actively pursued by police following the incident, forcing Nayanar to go into hiding in forest areas in Eleri. Later on, as Chief Minister, he set up a Government College in the area in 1981. The college was renamed to E.K. Nayanar Memorial Government college. While in hiding in Travancore, he worked as a journalist for Kerala Kaumudi.

=== Post-Independence ===
After Independence, cases against Nayanar were dropped. He continued working actively for Communist Party of India. He was elected Kannur taluk secretary in 1948. He again was forced to go into hiding following &#x27;Calcutta Thesis&#x27; proclamation that lead to banning Communist Party in India. During the Sino-Indian War, Nayanar was accused of being pro-China and was imprisoned in 1964 under the Preventive Detention Act. He was the secretary of Kozhikode district committee of the united CPI from 1956 to 1964.

Nayanar was also one of the 32 CPI national council members who walked out and formed CPI(M) in 1964. He was a central committee member of the CPI(M) from the 7th Congress in 1964. He served as the Secretary of the Kerala State Committee of the CPI(M) from 1972 to 1980 and again from 1992 to 1996. He was elected to the Polit Bureau at the 14th Congress in 1992.

=== Legislative career ===
In 1967, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Palakkad. He became an MLA for the first time from Irikkur legislative assembly in 1974. Since then, he has been elected as an MLA five more times (twice each from Malampuzha (1980 and 1982) and Thrikkarippur (1987 and 1991) and once from Thalasseri (1996)), losing only once.

==Chief Minister of Kerala==
=== Electoral History as the leader of LDF===
===First term (1980 - 1982)===

The 1980 election saw the formation of two pre-poll alliances, viz. LDF and UDF, most of whose constituent parties were part of the erstwhile United Front. CPI(M)-led LDF to win the election, after winning 93 seats altogether. E. K. Nayanar was sworn in as the Chief Minister on 26 March 1980 Nayanar was sworn in as the Chief Minister of Kerala on 26 March 1980 for the first time in 1980. He formed government with the support of Congress (A) under A. K. Antony and Kerala Congress under K. M. Mani. But both the parties left for United Democratic Front (UDF) coalition and the Government was dissolved on 20 October 1981. He served as the leader of the opposition from 1981 to 1987.

===Second term (1987 - 1991)===
In the 1987 election under the leadership of Nayanar LDF secured a decisive majority in the assembly securing 78 seats. The UDF won 61 seats. Nayanar became the chief Minister for a second time in 1987. But he did not complete his term of five years as CPI(M) decided to contest elections early in 1991 assuming political climate to be favourable. But the left lost the elections and Nayanar became the leader of the opposition yet again. He resigned from that post the very next year when he was chosen as the Kerala state secretary of the CPI(M) and was succeeded by V. S. Achuthanandan as the opposition leader.

===Third term (1996 - 2001)===

In the 1996 election, LDF secured a decisive majority in the assembly securing 80 seats. Nayanar initially had not contested the 1996 assembly elections but as V. S. Achuthanandan who was projected as the Chief Ministerial candidate lost in Mararikkulam. A faction in the party wanted Susheela Gopalan to be the Chief Minister, but when the matter was put to vote in the state secretariat, Nayanar was selected to be the CM. He contested and won by-elections in Thalasseri.
He is revered and respected by both the LDF and UDF for his contributions for the development of the state.

===Achievements===
Nayanar introduced several reforms during his tenures as Chief Minister like The Kerala Coir workers Welfare Fund Act, 1987, The Kerala Khadi Workers Welfare Fund Act, 1989, The Kerala Abkari Workers Welfare Fund Act, 1989, The Kerala Construction Workers Welfare Fund Act, 1989 and the Kerala Ration Dealer&#x27;s Welfare Fund Act, 1998. In 1996, the new LDF government led by EK Nayanar made People&#x27;s Planning Campaign. The government commissioned a staggering 33% of its money to local governments like the panchayats, municipalities and corporations. The campaign thus allowed for the provision of a three-tier system of power in panchayats and a one tier system in urban areas, and also helped local people to determine and implement their own development priorities. This helped make the government more effective, more inclusive and moreover people-centric. Decentralisation was implemented.

The Total Literacy Campaign (TLC) in Kerala was a landmark initiative that aimed to eradicate illiteracy and promote universal literacy. The campaign was launched on January 26, 1989 by Nayanar in Ernakulam district and later expanded statewide. The campaign, supported by the government and civil society, played a pivotal role in Kerala becoming India&#x27;s first fully literate state in April 18, 1991 within 2 years.
Nayanar visited the Apple facility in the Silicon Valley, United States in 1989. This led to form Techopark, India&#x27;s first IT park and still remains the largest in India. Nayanar laid the foundation stone on 1990. Technopark came into being on 28 July 1990, after it was registered under the Travancore Cochin Scientific and Charitable Societies Act. As of 2020, the IT park employs 70,000 people and provide indirect employment to lakhs.

In 1998, Kutumbashree, a movement for the empowerment of women, was launched by the Nayanar Government. Today, Kudumbashree is Kerala&#x27;s 43 lakh women community network, which is spread across 941 Panchayats. Kudumbashree is always the most ignored pillar of the Kerala Model. In 1989, EK Nayanar started the total literacy campaign, leading to a declaration in April 1991 that Kerala was the first totally literate state in the country.
In 1996, Nayanar took over as chairman of the Cochin International Airport (CIAL) project. The construction picked up momentum during this period and Nayanar ensured that the airport project received special attention from the State Government and gave his unstinted support to CIAL. By 1997, substantial land was taken into CIAL possession through negotiated settlements. On 25 May 1999 in the presence of then President of India, K. R. Narayanan inaugurated the airport.
The Kannur International Airport project was conceived in 1996 when Nayanar was the Chief Minister of Kerala. Nayanar was instrumental for the establishment of Kannur University. The university was inaugurated on 2 March 1996 by Nayanar. The objective of the Kannur University Act, 1996 was to establish in the state of Kerala a teaching, residential and affiliating university to provide for the development of higher education in Kasargod and Kannur revenue Districts and the Mananthavady Taluk of Wayanad District.
The government led by Nayanar ideated the Kochi Metro Project in 1999. The cabinet meeting held on 21 July 1999, of the then LDF government, assigned Rail India Technological and Economic Services (RITES) for the feasibility study for a metro rapid transport system in Kochi. The techno-economic feasibility study for a Metro Rapid Transit System in Kochi was completed in 1999, which was begun in the same year, by Rail India Technological and Economic Services (RITES). The techno-feasibility study report was submitted to the state government in 1999.

== Literary works ==
Nayanar has authored several works in both English and Malayalam. He was also an occasional poet. A few notable works are:
#&quot;Olivukala Smrithkal&quot;: Memories of Hideout Days &gt; 
# &quot;Doha Diary&quot;

<text>Donna Shea, better known as Scarlet Rivera is an American violinist. She is best known for her work with Bob Dylan, in particular on his 1976 album &quot;Desire&quot; and as part of the Rolling Thunder Revue.

== Life and career==
Born Donna Shea in Joliet, Illinois, Rivera was privately trained in classical violin and studied at the Mannes School of Music.

Bob Dylan is said to have discovered Rivera in New York City before the rehearsal for his 1975 Rolling Thunder Revue tour. While being driven in his limousine around Greenwich Village, Dylan spotted Rivera walking with her violin case. Dylan stopped to converse with Rivera and invited her to his rehearsal studio where she spent the afternoon playing along with several of his new songs. &quot;If I had crossed the street seconds earlier,&quot; said Rivera in 2012, &quot;it never would have happened.&quot; After a session with her, Dylan invited Rivera to play on the Rolling Thunder Revue tour. She played an important role in Dylan&#x27;s studio album &quot;Desire&quot;.

In 1977, Rivera released her self-titled debut LP for Warner Bros. Records. According to &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, the album was regarded by some as &quot;the worst record of the year&quot;. Lindsay Planer from AllMusic praised the album, saying that Rivera &quot;has consistently found specific and viable places for the violin in rock&quot;.

Rivera has recorded multiple albums as a composer in numerous styles, instrumental, new-age, Celtic and world music. She has performed in the US, Europe and Japan with her Celtic group. Rivera was a soloist with the Duke Ellington Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and the Carnival of Venice.

She has also appeared on albums by Tracy Chapman, (&quot;Crossroads&quot;), Keb Mo&#x27;, (&quot;The Door&quot;), Dee Dee Bridgewater (&quot;Just Family&quot;), David Johansen, (&quot;David Johansen&quot;), and Indigo Girls.

In recent years Rivera has recorded new age, instrumental, world, and Celtic music. She has also toured in Japan with the US-based South American group Ritual with Uruguayans Federico Ramos and Eduardo Marquez del Signore. She recorded the album &quot;Celtic Mist&quot; which was released in Japan. She also played violin on the 2014 album &quot;After the Fall&quot;, by UK-based Dodson and Fogg.

She was a special guest artist in the band in &quot;Joni 75: A Birthday Celebration&quot;, a birthday concert held in honor of Joni Mitchell on November 7, 2018, in Los Angeles and also in the concert with Brandi Carlile for Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; album in October 2019.

Rivera was featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2019 pseudo-documentary film &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story&quot; and attended the premiere in New York in June 2019.

Rivera released the EP &quot;All of Me&quot; in April 2020 on Bright Sun Records, singing her own songs.

In May 2021, to celebrate Bob Dylan&#x27;s 80th birthday, Rivera, along with Nine Mile Station, released a new version of &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Paul Zollo, a writer for &quot;American Songwriter&quot; said that &quot;Her presence of sound and spirit lifts this &#x27;Hurricane&#x27; into a higher realm. The reverence she has for the song and its songwriter shines in the purity and passion of her playing.&quot;

She continues to be an active recording artist, performer and composer, and is currently working on an album &quot;Celtic Magic&quot; to be released later in 2022.

== Personal life ==
Rivera is of Irish-Sicilian ancestry. She was married in 1991 to the British session keyboardist Tommy Eyre. The marriage lasted until his death in 2001.

<text>A camera phone is a mobile phone that is able to capture photographs and often record video using one or more built-in digital cameras. It can also send the resulting image wirelessly and conveniently. The first commercial phone with a color camera was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. While cameras in mobile phones used to be supplementary, they have been a major selling point of mobile phones since the 2010s.

Most camera phones are smaller and simpler than the separate digital cameras. In the smartphone era, the steady sales increase of camera phones caused point-and-shoot camera sales to peak about 2010, and decline thereafter. The concurrent improvement of smartphone camera technology and its other multifunctional benefits have led to it gradually replacing compact point-and-shoot cameras.

Most modern smartphones only have a menu choice to start a camera application program and an on-screen button to activate the shutter. Some also have a separate camera button for quickness and convenience. A few, such as the 2009 Samsung i8000 Omnia II or S8000 Jet, have a two-level shutter button as in dedicated digital cameras. Some camera phones are designed to resemble separate low-end digital compact cameras in appearance and, to some degree, in features and picture quality, and are branded as both mobile phones and cameras—an example being the 2013 Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom.

The principal advantages of camera phones are cost and compactness; indeed, for a user who carries a mobile phone anyway, the addition is negligible. Smartphones that are camera phones may run mobile applications to add capabilities such as geotagging and image stitching. Also, modern smartphones can use their touch screens to direct their cameras to focus on a particular object in the field of view, giving even an inexperienced user a degree of focus control exceeded only by seasoned photographers using manual focus. However, the touch screen, being a general-purpose control, lacks the agility of a separate camera&#x27;s dedicated buttons and dial(s).

Starting in the mid-2010s, some advanced camera phones featured optical image stabilisation (OIS), larger sensors, bright lenses, 4K video, and even optical zoom, for which a few used a physical zoom lens. Multiple lenses and multi-shot night modes are also familiar. Since the late 2010s, high-end smartphones typically have multiple lenses with different functions to make more use of a device&#x27;s limited physical space. Common lens functions include an ultrawide sensor, a telephoto sensor, a macro sensor, and a depth sensor. Some phone cameras have a label that indicates the lens manufacturer, megapixel count, or features such as autofocus or zoom ability for emphasis, including the Samsung Omnia II or S8000 Jet (2009) and Galaxy S II (2011) and S20 (2020), Sony Xperia Z1 (2013) and some successors, and Nokia Lumia 1020 (2013).

== Technology ==
Mobile phone cameras typically feature CMOS active-pixel image sensors (CMOS sensors) due to largely reduced power consumption compared to charge-coupled device (CCD) type cameras. Some use CMOS back-illuminated sensors, which use even less energy, at a higher price than CMOS and CCD.

The usual fixed-focus lenses and smaller sensors limit performance in poor lighting. Lacking a physical shutter, some have a long shutter lag. Photoflash by the typical internal LED source illuminates less intensely over a much longer exposure time than a flash strobe, and none has a hot shoe for attaching an external flash. Optical zoom and tripod screws are rare, and some also lack a USB connection or a removable memory card. Most have Bluetooth and WiFi and can make geotagged photographs. Some of the more expensive camera phones have only a few of these technical disadvantages, but with bigger image sensors (a few are up to 1&quot;, such as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-CM1), their capabilities approach those of low-end point-and-shoot cameras. The few hybrid camera phones, such as Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom and K Zoom, were equipped with real optical zoom lenses.


As camera phone technology has progressed, lens design has evolved from a simple double Gauss or Cooke triplet to many molded plastic aspheric lens elements made with varying dispersion and refractive indexes. Some phone cameras also apply distortion (optics), vignetting, and various optical aberration corrections to the image before it is compressed into a JPEG format.

Optical image stabilization allows longer exposures without blurring, despite trembling. The earliest known smartphone to feature it on the rear camera is in late 2012 on the Nokia Lumia 920, and the first known front camera to feature one is on the HTC 10 from early 2016.

Few smartphones, such as LG initially with the 2014 G3, are equipped with a time-of-flight camera with infrared laser beam assisted auto focus. A thermal imaging camera has initially been implemented in 2016 on the Caterpillar S60.

High dynamic range imaging merges multiple images with different exposure values for a balanced brightness across the image and was first implemented in early 2010s smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy S III and iPhone 5. The earliest known smartphone to feature high dynamic range filming is the Sony Xperia Z, 2013, where frames are arrayed by changing the exposure every two lines of pixels to create a spatially varying exposure (&quot;SVE&quot;).

As of 2019, high-end camera phones can produce video with up to 4K resolution at 60 frames per second for smoothness.

=== Zooming ===

Most camera phones have a digital zoom feature, which may allow zooming without quality loss if a lower resolution than the highest image sensor resolution is selected, as it makes use of image sensors&#x27; spare resolution. For example, at twice digital zoom, only a quarter of the image sensor resolution is available. A few have optical zoom, and several have a few cameras with different fields of view, combined with digital zoom as a hybrid zoom feature. For example, the Huawei P30 Pro uses a periscope 5x telephoto camera with up to 10x digital zoom, resulting in 50x hybrid zoom. An external camera can be added, coupled wirelessly to the phone by Wi-Fi. They are compatible with most smartphones. Windows Phones can be configured to operate as a camera even if the phone is asleep.

=== Physical location ===
When viewed vertically from behind, the rear camera module on some mobile phones is located in the top center, while other mobile phones have cameras located in the upper left corner. The latter has benefits in terms of ergonomy due to the lower likelihood of covering and soiling the lens when held horizontally, as well as more efficient packing of tight physical device space due to neighbouring components not having to be built around the lens.

=== Audio recording ===
Mobile phones with multiple microphones usually allow video recording with stereo audio. Samsung, Sony, and HTC initially implemented it in 2012 on their Samsung Galaxy S3, Sony Xperia S, and HTC One X. Apple implemented stereo audio starting with the 2018 iPhone Xs family and iPhone XR.

=== Low light photography ===
In the past, manufacturers of mobile phone cameras had to compromise between the amount of detail they could capture in good light and the brightness of images in low light. With pixel binning, both have been accomplished with the same image sensor.

=== Multimedia Messaging Service ===

Camera phones can share pictures almost instantly and automatically via a sharing infrastructure integrated with the carrier network. Early developers, including Philippe Kahn, envisioned a technology that would enable service providers to &quot;collect a fee every time anyone snaps a photo&quot;. The resulting technologies, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) and Sha-Mail, were developed in parallel to and in competition with open Internet-based mobile communication provided by GPRS and later 3G networks.

The first commercial camera phone, complete with infrastructure, was the J-SH04, made by Sharp Corporation; it had an integrated CCD sensor, with the Sha-Mail (Picture-Mail in Japanese) infrastructure developed in collaboration with Kahn&#x27;s LightSurf venture, and marketed from 2001 by J-Phone in Japan today owned by Softbank. It was also the world&#x27;s first cellular mobile camera phone. The first commercial deployment in North America of camera phones was in 2004. The Sprint wireless carriers deployed over one million camera phones manufactured by Sanyo and launched by the PictureMail infrastructure (Sha-Mail in English) developed and managed by LightSurf.

While early phones had Internet connectivity, working web browsers, and email programs, the phone menu offered no way of including a photo in an email or uploading it to a website. Connecting cables or removable media that would enable the local transfer of pictures were also usually missing. Modern smartphones have almost unlimited connectivity and transfer options with photograph attachment features.

=== External camera ===

During 2003 (as camera phones were gaining popularity), in Europe some phones without cameras had support for MMS and external cameras that could be connected with a small cable or directly to the data port at the base of the phone. The external cameras were comparable in quality to those fitted on regular camera phones at the time, typically offering VGA resolution.

One of these examples was the Nokia Fun Camera (model number PT-3) announced together with the Nokia 3100 in June 2003. The idea was for it to be used on devices without a built-in camera (connected via the Pop-Port interface) and be able to transfer images taken on the camera (VGA resolution and a flash) directly to the phone to be stored or sent via MMS.

In 2013-2014, Sony and other manufacturers announced add-on camera modules for smartphones called lens-style cameras. They have larger sensors and lenses than those in a camera phone but lack a viewfinder, display, and most controls. They can be mounted to an Android or iOS phone or tablet and use its display and controls. Lens-style cameras include:
* Sony SmartShot QX series, announced and released in mid-2013. They include the DSC-QX100/B, the large Sony ILCE-QX1, and the small Sony DSC-QX30.
* Kodak PixPro smart lens camera series, announced in 2014.
* The DxO ONE is a small camera that attaches to an Apple iPhone or iPad using the Lightning connector port.
* Vivicam smart lens camera series from Vivitar/Sakar, announced in 2014.
* HTC RE HTC also announced an external camera module for smartphones, which can capture 16 MP still shots and Full HD videos. The RE Module is also waterproof and dustproof, so it can be used in a variety of conditions.

External cameras for thermal imaging also became available in late 2014.

Microscope attachments were available from several manufacturers in 2019, as were adapters for connecting an astronomical telescope.

=== Limitations ===
* Mobile phone form factors are small. They lack space for a large image sensor and dedicated knobs and buttons for easier ergonomy. 
* There is no space for an optical zoom lens, with the exception of hybrid camera smartphones such as the Samsung Galaxy K Zoom and S4 Zoom. Some smartphones are equipped with additional lenses to simulate optical zooming.
* Controls work by a touchscreen menu system. The photographer must look at the menu instead of looking at the target.
* Dedicated cameras have a compartment housing the memory card and battery. For most it is easily accessible by hand, allowing uninterrupted operation when storage or energy is exhausted (hot swapping). Meanwhile, the battery can be charged externally. Most mobile phones have a non-replaceable battery and many lack a memory card slot entirely. Others have a memory card slot inside a tray, requiring a tool for access.
* Mobile phone operating systems are not able to boot immediately like the firmwares of dedicated digital cameras/camcorders, and are prone to interference from processes running in the background.
* Dedicated digital cameras, even low-budget ones, are typically equipped with a photoflash capacitor-discharging Xenon flash, larger and by far more powerful than LED lamps found on mobile phones.
* Due to the default orientation of mobile phones being vertical, inexperienced users might intuitively be encouraged to film vertically, making a portrait mode poorly suited to the usual horizontal screens used at home.
* Due to their comparatively thin form factor, smartphones are typically unable to stand upright on their own and must be leaned, whereas dedicated digital cameras and camcorders typically have a flat bottom that lets them stand upright.
* Smartphones lack dedicated, stable tripod mounts and can only be mounted through a less stable device that grips the unit&#x27;s edges.

== Software ==
Users may use bundled camera software or install alternative software. Bundled software may be optimized by the vendor for performance, whereas alternative software may offer functionality and controls and customization missing in bundled software.

The graphical user interface typically features a virtual on-screen shutter button located towards the usual home button and charging port side, a thumbnail previewing the last photo, and some status icons that may display settings such as selected resolution, scene mode, stabilization, flash, and a battery indicator. The camera software may indicate the estimated number of remaining photographs until exhausted space, the current video file size, and remaining space storage while recording, as done on early-2010s Samsung smartphones. Shortcuts to settings in the camera viewfinder may be customizable.
In September 2013, Apple introduced a camera viewfinder layout with iOS 7 that would be implemented by several other major vendors towards the late 2010s. This layout has a circular and usually solid-colour shutter button and a camera mode selector using perpendicular text and separate camera modes for photo and video. Vendors that have ditched their layout to implement variations of Apple&#x27;s layout include Samsung, Huawei, LG, OnePlus, Xiaomi, and UleFone.

There may be an option to utilize volume keys for photo, video, or zoom. Specific objects can usually be focused on by tapping on the viewfinder, and exposure may adjust accordingly; there may be an option to capture a photo with each tap.

Exposure value may be adjustable by swiping vertically after tapping to focus or through a separate menu option. It may be possible to lock focus and exposure by holding the touch for a short time, and exposure value may remain adjustable in this state. These gestures may be available while filming and for the front camera.

Retaining focus has also in the past through holding the virtual shutter button. Another common use of holding the shutter button is burst shot, where multiple photos are captured in quick succession, with varying resolutions, speeds, and sequential limits among devices, and possibly with an option to adjust between speed and resolution.

Shutter lag varies depending on computing speed, software implementation, and environmental brightness. A shutter animation such as skeuomorphic aperture diaphragm blades or a simple short black-out may be featured. A haptic (vibration) feedback may be used to signify a captured photograph, which is of use when holding the smartphone in an angle with poor visibility of the screen.

Lock screens typically allow the user to launch the camera without unlocking to prevent missing moments. This may be implemented through an icon swiped away from. Launching from anywhere may be possible through double-press of power/stand-by or home button, or a dedicated shutter button if present. Pictures taken and videos recorded since the launching of the camera can usually be reviewed without unlocking the phone, while unlocking the phone is necessary to view earlier media.

Camera software on more recent and higher-end smartphones (e.g., Samsung since 2015) allows for more manual control of parameters such as exposure and focus. This was first featured in 2013 on the camera-centric Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom and Nokia Lumia 1020, but was later expanded among smartphones. Few smartphones&#x27; bundled camera software, such as that of the LG V10 features an image histogram, a feature known from higher-end dedicated cameras.

=== Video recording ===
Video recording may be implemented as a separate camera mode, or merged on the first viewfinder page as done since the Samsung Galaxy S4 until the S9. Specific resolutions may be implemented as separate camera mode, like Sony has done with 4K (2160p) on the Xperia Z2.

During video recording, it may be possible to capture still photos, possibly with a higher resolution than the video itself. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S4 captures still photos during video recording at 9.6 Megapixels, which is the largest 16:9 aspect ratio crop of the 13-Megapixel 4:3 image sensor.

Parameters adjustable during video recording may include flashlight illumination, focus, exposure, light sensitivity (ISO), and white balance. Some settings may only be adjustable while idle and locked while filming, such as light sensitivity and exposure on the Samsung Galaxy S7.

Recording time may be limited by software to fixed durations at specific resolutions, after which recording can be restarted. For example, 2160p (4K) recording is capped to five minutes on Samsung flagship smartphones released before 2016, ten minutes on the Galaxy Note 7, four minutes on the Galaxy Alpha, and six minutes on the HTC One M9. The camera software may temporarily disable recording while a high device temperature is detected.

&quot;Slow motion&quot; (high frame rate) video may be stored as real-time video which retains the original image sensor frame rate and audio track, or slowed down and muted. While the latter allows slow-motion playback on older video player software which lacks playback speed control, the former can act both as real-time video and as slow-motion video, and is preferable for editing as the playback speed and duration indicated in the video editor are real-life equivalent.

=== Settings menu ===
Camera settings may appear as a menu on top of an active viewfinder in the background, or as a separate page, the former of which allows returning to the viewfinder immediately without having to wait for it to initiate again. The settings may appear as a grid or a list. On Apple iOS, some camera settings such as video resolution are located separately in the system settings, outside the camera application.

The range of selectable resolution levels for photos and videos varies among camera software. There may be settings for frame rate and bit rate, as on the LG V10, where they are implemented independently within a supported pixel rate (product of resolution and frame rate).

When the selected photo or video resolution is below that of the image sensor, digital zooming may allow limited magnification without quality loss by cropping into the image sensor&#x27;s spare resolution. This is known as &quot;lossless digital zoom&quot;. Zooming is typically implemented through pinch and may additionally be controllable through a slider. On early-2010s Samsung Galaxy smartphones, a square visualizes the magnification.

=== Files and directories ===
Like dedicated (&quot;stand-alone&quot;) digital cameras, mobile phone camera software usually stores pictures and video files in a directory called codice_1 in the internal memory, with numbered or dated file names. The former prevents missing out files during file transfers and facilitates counting files, whereas the latter facilitates searching files by date/time, regardless of file attribute resets during transfer and possible lack of in-file metadata date/time information .

Some can store this media in external memory (secure digital card or USB on the go pen drive).

=== Image format and mode ===
Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format. Since the mid-2010s, some high-end camera phones have a RAW photography feature, HDR, and &quot;Bokeh mode&quot;. Phones with Android 5.0 Lollipop and later versions can install phone apps that provide similar features.

Since iOS 11 (HEIC), Android 8 (Oreo) (HEIF), Android 10 (HEIC) and Android 12 (AVIF), HEIC and AVIF compression formats in HEIF container format are available. HEIC support on Android requires hardware support.

=== Other functionality ===
;Capturing in both directions
The ability to take photographs and film from both front and rear cameras simultaneously was first implemented in 2013 on the Samsung Galaxy S4, where the two video tracks are stored picture-in-picture. An implementation with separate video tracks within a file or separate video files is not known yet.

;Voice commands
Voice commands were first featured in 2012 on the camera software of the Samsung Galaxy S3, and the ability to take a photo after a short countdown initiated by hand gesture was first featured in 2015 on the Galaxy S6.

;Camera controls
Camera software may allow locking and unlocking touch input using the power button to prevent accidentally exiting or otherwise undesirably interfering with the viewfinder while recording video or keeping the camera idle in pocket for quicker access.

Camera software may have an option for automatically capturing a photograph or video when launched.

;&quot;Live photo&quot; / &quot;Motion photo&quot;
Some smartphones since the mid-2010s have the ability to attach short videos surrounding or following the moment to a photo. Apple has branded this feature as &quot;live photo&quot;, and Samsung as &quot;motion photo&quot;.

;Remote viewfinder
A &quot;remote viewfinder&quot; feature has been implemented into few smartphones&#x27; camera software (Samsung Galaxy S4, S4 Zoom, Note 3, S5, K Zoom, Alpha), where the viewfinder and camera controls are cast to a supported device through WiFi Direct.

;High dynamic range (HDR)
High-dynamic-range imaging, also referred to as &quot;rich tone&quot;, keeps brightness across the image within a visible range. Camera software may have an option for turning HDR off, to avoid possible shutter lag and ghosting. Some software allows retaining both HDR and non-HDR variants of the same photo. HDR may be supported for panorama shots and video recording, if supported by the image sensor.

;Visual effects and low light
The camera effects introduced by Samsung on the Galaxy S3 or S4 including &quot;best photo&quot; which automatically picks a photo and &quot;drama shot&quot; for multiplying moving objects and &quot;eraser&quot; which can remove moving objects, were merged to &quot;shot &amp; more&quot; on the Galaxy S5, allowing retrospectively applying them to a burst of eight images stored in a single file.

In 2014, HTC implemented several visual effect features as part of their dual-camera setup on the One M8, including weather, 3D tilting, and focus adjustment after capture, branded &quot;uFocus&quot;. The last was branded &quot;Selective Focus&quot; by Samsung, additionally with the &quot;pan focus&quot; option to make the entire depth of field appear in focus.

Huawei has branded a dedicated camera feature for prolonged exposure &quot;light painting&quot;, as the long exposure time allows creating trails of objects that emit light. A &quot;handheld night shot&quot; mode tries compositing a picture as clear as possible from many frames captured in a dark environment throughout several seconds. The user is instructed to hold the unit as steady as possible.

;Object tracking
The earliest known smartphone to feature an autofocus with the ability from dedicated camcorders to track objects is the Galaxy S6.

;Augumented reality
Starting in 2013 on the Xperia Z1, Sony experimented with real-time augmented reality camera effects such as floating text, virtual plants, volcano, and a dinosaur walking in the scenery. Apple later did similarly in 2017 with the iPhone X.

;Artificial intelligence
An artificial intelligence that notifies of flaws after each photograph such as blinking eyes, misfocus, blur, and shake, was first implemented in 2018 on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9. Later phones from other manufacturers have more advanced AI features.

== History ==
The camera phone, like many complex systems, is the result of converging and enabling technologies. Compared to digital cameras, a consumer-viable camera in a mobile phone would require far less power and a higher level of camera electronics integration to permit the miniaturization.

The active pixel sensor (APS) was developed in 1985. While the first camera phones (e.g. J-SH04) successfully marketed by J-Phone in Japan used charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors rather than CMOS sensors, more than 90% of camera phones sold today use CMOS image sensor technology.

Another important enabling factor was advances in data compression, due to the impractically high memory and bandwidth requirements of uncompressed media. The most important compression algorithm is the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique that was first proposed by Nasir Ahmed while he was working at the University of Texas in 1972. Camera phones were enabled by DCT-based compression standards, including the H.26x and MPEG video coding standards introduced from 1988 onwards, and the JPEG image compression standard introduced in 1992.

===Experiments===
There were several early videophones and cameras that included communication capability. Some devices experimented with the integration of the device to communicate wirelessly with the Internet, which would allow instant media sharing with anyone anywhere. The DELTIS VC-1100 by Japanese company Olympus was the world&#x27;s first digital camera with cellular phone transmission capability, revealed in the early 1990s and released in 1994. In 1995, Apple experimented with the Apple Videophone/PDA. There was also a digital camera with a cellular phone designed by Shosaku Kawashima of Canon in Japan in May 1997. In Japan, two competing projects were run by Sharp and Kyocera in 1997. Both had cell phones with integrated cameras. However, the Kyocera system was designed as a peer-to-peer video phone as opposed to the Sharp project, which was initially focused on sharing instant pictures. That was made possible when the Sharp devices was coupled to the Sha-mail infrastructure designed in collaboration with American technologist Kahn. The Kyocera team was led by Kazumi Saburi. In 1995, work by James Greenwold of Bureau Of Technical Services, in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, was developing a pocket video camera for surveillance purposes. By 1999, the Tardis recorder was in prototype and being used by the government. Bureau Of Technical Services advanced further by the patent No. 6,845,215,B1 on &quot;Body-Carryable, digital Storage medium, Audio/Video recording Assembly&quot;.

A camera phone was patented by Kari-Pekka Wilska, Reijo Paajanen, Mikko Terho and Jari Hämäläinen, four employees at Nokia, in 1994. Their patent application was filed with the Finnish Patent and Registration Office on May 19, 1994, followed by several filings around the world making it a global family of patent applications. The patent application specifically described the combination as either a separate digital camera connected to a cell phone or as an integrated system with both sub-systems combined in a single unit. Their patent application design included all of the basic functions camera phones implemented for many years: the capture, storage, and display of digital images and the means to transmit the images over the radio frequency channel. On August 12, 1998, the United Kingdom granted patent GB 2289555B and on July 30, 2002, the USPTO granted US Patent 6427078B1 based on the original Finnish Patent and Registration Office application to Wilska, Paajanen, Terho and Hämäläinen.
On June 11, 1997, Philippe Kahn instantly shared the first pictures from the maternity ward where his daughter Sophie was born. In the hospital waiting room he devised a way to connect his laptop to his digital camera and to his cell phone for transmission to his home computer. This improvised system transmitted his pictures to more than 2,000 family, friends and associates around the world. Kahn&#x27;s improvised connections augured the birth of instant visual communications. Kahn&#x27;s cell phone transmission is the first known publicly shared picture via a cell phone. &quot;The Birth of the Camera Phone&quot; is a four minute short that reenacts the situation that Philippe Kahn was in.

===Commercialization===

The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999. It was called a &quot;mobile videophone&quot; at the time, and had a 110,000-pixel front-facing camera. It stored up to 20 JPEG digital images, which could be sent over e-mail, or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan&#x27;s Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) cellular network. The Samsung SCH-V200, released in South Korea in June 2000, was also one of the first phones with a built-in camera. It had a TFT liquid-crystal display (LCD) and stored up to 20 digital photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. However, it could not send the resulting image over the telephone function, but required a computer connection to access photos. The first mass-market camera phone was the J-SH04, a Sharp J-Phone model sold in Japan in November 2000. It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication.
Cameras on cell phones proved popular right from the start, as indicated by the J-Phone in Japan having had more than half of its subscribers using cell phone cameras in two years. The world soon followed. In 2003, more camera phones were sold worldwide than stand-alone digital cameras largely due to growth in Japan and Korea. In 2005, Nokia became the world&#x27;s most sold digital camera brand. In 2006, half of the world&#x27;s mobile phones had a built-in camera. In 2006, Thuraya released the first satellite phone with an integrated camera. The Thuraya SG-2520 was manufactured by Korean company APSI and ran Windows CE. In 2008, Nokia sold more camera phones than Kodak sold film-based simple cameras, thus becoming the biggest manufacturer of any kind of camera. In 2010, the worldwide number of camera phones totaled more than a billion. Since 2010, most mobile phones, even the cheapest ones, are being sold with a camera. High-end camera phones usually had a relatively good lens and high resolution.

Higher resolution camera phones started to appear in the 2010s. 12-megapixel camera phones have been produced by at least two companies. To highlight the capabilities of the Nokia N8 (Big CMOS Sensor) camera, Nokia created a short film, &quot;The Commuter&quot;, in October 2010. The seven-minute film was shot entirely on the phone&#x27;s 720p camera. A 14-megapixel smartphone with 3× optical zoom was announced in late 2010. In 2011, the first phones with dual rear cameras were released to the market but failed to gain traction. Originally, dual rear cameras were implemented as a way to capture 3D content, which was something that electronics manufacturers were pushing back then. Several years later, the release of the iPhone 7 would popularize this concept, but instead using the second lens as a wide angle lens. 
In 2012, Nokia announced Nokia 808 PureView. It features a 41-megapixel 1/1.2-inch sensor and a high-resolution f/2.4 Zeiss all-aspherical one-group lens. It also features Nokia&#x27;s PureView Pro technology, a pixel oversampling technique that reduces an image taken at full resolution into a lower resolution picture, thus achieving higher definition and light sensitivity, and enables lossless zoom. In mid-2013, Nokia announced the Nokia Lumia 1020. In 2014, the HTC One M8 introduced the concept of having a camera as a depth sensor. In late 2016, Apple introduced the iPhone 7 Plus, one of the phones to popularize a dual camera setup. The iPhone 7 Plus included a main 12 MP camera along with a 12 MP telephoto camera which allowed for 2x optical zoom and Portrait Mode for the first time in a smartphone. In early 2018 Huawei released a new flagship phone, the Huawei P20 Pro, with the first triple camera lens setup. Making up its three sensors (co-engineered with Leica) are a 40 megapixel RGB lens, a 20 megapixel monochrome lens, and an 8 megapixel telephoto lens. Some features on the Huawei P20 Pro include 3x optical zoom, and 960 fps slow motion. In late 2018, Samsung released a new mid-range smartphone, the Galaxy A9 (2018) with the world&#x27;s first quad camera setup. The quadruple camera setup features a primary 24 MP f/1.7 sensor for normal photography, an ultra-wide 8 MP f/2.4 sensor with a 120 degrees viewing angle, a telephoto 10 MP f/2.4 with 2x optical zoom and a 5 MP depth sensor for effects such as b`okeh. Nokia 9 PureView was released in 2019 featuring penta-lens camera system.
In 2019, Samsung Electronics announced the Galaxy A80, which has only rear cameras. When the user wants to take a selfie, the cameras automatically slide out of the back and rotate towards the user. This is known as a pop-up camera, and it allows smartphone displays to cover the entire front of the phone body without a notch or a punch hole on the top of the screen. Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, OnePlus, and other manufacturers adopted a system where the camera &quot;pops&quot; out of the phone&#x27;s body. Also in 2019, Samsung developed and began commercialization of 64 and 108-megapixel cameras for phones. The 108 MP sensor was developed in cooperation with Chinese electronics company Xiaomi and both sensors are capable of pixel binning, which combines the signals of 4 or 9 pixels, and makes the 4 or 9 pixels act as a single, larger pixel. A larger pixel can capture more light (resulting in a higher ISO rating and lower image noise). Furthermore, under display cameras are being developed, which would be placed under a special display, allowing the camera to see through it, such as in the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.

==Manufacturers==

Major manufacturers of cameras for phones include Sony, Toshiba, ST Micro, Sharp, Omnivision, and Aptina (Now part of ON Semiconductor).

== Social impact ==


Personal photography allows people to capture and construct personal and group memory, maintain social relationships as well as express their identity. The hundreds of millions
of camera phones sold every year provide the same opportunities, yet these functions are altered and allow for a different user experience. As mobile phones are constantly carried, they allow for capturing moments at any time. Mobile communication also allows for immediate transmission of content (for example via Multimedia Messaging Services), which cannot be reversed or regulated. Brooke Knight observes that &quot;the carrying of an external, non-integrated camera (like a DSLR) always changes the role of the wearer at an event, from participant to photographer&quot;. The camera phone user, on the other hand, can remain a participant in whatever moment they photograph. Photos taken on a camera phone serve to prove the physical presence of the photographer. The immediacy of sharing and the liveness that comes with it allows the photographs shared through camera phones to emphasize their indexing of the photographer.

While phones have been found useful by tourists and for other common civilian purposes, as they are cheap, convenient, and portable; they have also posed controversy, as they enable secret photography. A user may pretend to be simply talking on the phone or browsing the internet, drawing no suspicion while photographing a person or place in non-public areas where photography is restricted, or against that person&#x27;s wishes. Camera phones have enabled everyone to exercise freedom of speech by quickly communicating to others what they see with their own eyes. In most democratic free countries, there are no restrictions against photography in public and thus camera phones enable new forms of citizen journalism, fine art photography, and recording one&#x27;s life experiences for facebooking or blogging.

Camera phones have also been very useful to street photographers and social documentary photographers as they enable them to take pictures of strangers in the street without them noticing, thus allowing the artist/photographer to get close to subjects and take more lively photos. While most people are suspect of secret photography, artists who do street photography (like Henri Cartier-Bresson did), photojournalists and photographers documenting people in public (like the photographers who documented the Great Depression in 1930s America) must often work unnoticed as their subjects are often unwilling to be photographed or are not aware of legitimate uses of secret photography like those photos that end up in fine art galleries and journalism.

As a network-connected device, megapixel camera phones are playing significant roles in crime prevention, journalism and business applications as well as individual uses. They can also be used for activities such as voyeurism, invasion of privacy, and copyright infringement. Because they can be used to share media almost immediately, they are a potent personal content creation tool.

Camera phones limit the &quot;right to be let alone&quot;, since this recording tool is always present. A security bug can allow attackers to spy on users through a phone camera.

In January 2007, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced a plan to encourage people to use their camera phones to capture crimes happening in progress or dangerous situations and send them to emergency responders. The program enables people to send their images or video directly to 911. The service went live in 2020.

Camera phones have also been used to discreetly take photographs in museums, performance halls, and other places where photography is prohibited. However, as sharing can be instantaneous, even if the action is discovered, it is too late, as the image is already out of reach, unlike a photo taken by a digital camera that only stores images locally for later transfer. However, as the newer digital cameras support Wi-Fi, a photographer can perform photography with a DSLR and instantly post the photo on the internet through the mobile phone&#x27;s Wi-Fi and 3G capabilities.

Apart from street photographers and social documentary photographers or cinematographers, camera phones have also been used successfully by war photographers. The small size of the camera phone allows a war photographer to secretly film the men and women who fight in a war, without them realizing that they have been photographed, thus the camera phone allows the war photographer to document wars while maintaining their safety.

In 2010, in Ireland the annual &quot;RTÉ 60 second short award&quot; was won by 15-year-old Laura Gaynor, who made her winning cartoon, &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; on her Sony Ericsson C510 camera phone. In 2012, director and writer Eddie Brown Jr. made the reality thriller &quot;Camera Phone&quot;, one of the first commercial produced movies using camera phones as the story&#x27;s perspective. The film is a reenactment of an actual case, and the names were changed to protect those involved. Some modern camera phones (in 2013–2014) have big sensors, thus allowing a street photographer or any other kind of photographer to take photos of similar quality to a semi-professional camera.

== Camera as an interaction device ==
The cameras of smartphones are used as input devices in numerous research projects and commercial applications. A commercially successful example is the use of QR codes attached to physical objects. QR codes can be sensed by the phone using its camera and provide an according link to related digital content, usually a URL. Another approach is using camera images to recognize objects. Content-based image analysis is used to recognize physical objects such as advertisement posters to provide information about the object. Hybrid approaches use a combination of un-obtrusive visual markers and image analysis. An example is to estimate the pose of the camera phone to create a real-time overlay for a 3D paper globe.

Some smartphones can provide an augmented reality overlay for 2D objects and to recognize multiple objects on the phone using a stripped down object recognition algorithm as well as using GPS and compass. A few can translate text from a foreign language.

Auto-geotagging can show where a picture is taken, promoting interactions and allowing a photo to be mapped with others for comparison.

Most Smartphones are equipped with a front-facing camera. It faces towards the user for purposes like self-portraiture (coll. &quot;selfies&quot;), video blogging (&quot;vlogging&quot;), and for video conferencing. A mobile phone&#x27;s front-facing camera is typically of lower resolution and quality as compared to its rear camera due to its smaller sensor size. One counter-example for resolution is the HTC One M8, where the front camera has five megapixels, one more than the rear camera.

== Laws ==

Camera phones, or more specifically, widespread use of such phones as cameras by the general public, has increased exposure to laws relating to public and private photography. The laws that relate to other types of cameras also apply to camera phones. There are no special laws for camera phones. Enforcing bans on camera phones has proven nearly impossible. They are small and numerous and their use is easy to hide or disguise, making it hard for law enforcement and security personnel to detect or stop use. Total bans on camera phones would also raise questions about freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, since camera phone ban would prevent a citizen or a journalist (or a citizen journalist) from communicating to others a newsworthy event that could be captured with a camera phone.

From time to time, organizations and places have prohibited or restricted the use of camera phones and other cameras because of the privacy, security, and copyright issues they pose. Such places include the Pentagon, federal and state courts, museums, schools, theaters, and local fitness clubs. Saudi Arabia, in April 2004, banned the sale of camera phones nationwide for a time before reallowing their sale in December 2004 (although pilgrims on the Hajj were allowed to bring in camera phones). There is the occasional anecdote of camera phones linked to industrial espionage and the activities of paparazzi (which are legal but often controversial), as well as some hacking into wireless operators&#x27; network.

== Notable events involving camera phones ==
* The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was the first global news event where the majority of the first day news footage was no longer provided by professional news crews, but rather by citizen journalists, using primarily camera phones.
* On November 17, 2006, during a performance at the Laugh Factory comedy club, comedian Michael Richards was recorded responding to hecklers with racial slurs by a member of the audience using a camera phone. The video was widely circulated in television and internet news broadcasts.
* On December 30, 2006, the execution of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was recorded by a video camera phone, and made widely available on the Internet. A guard was arrested a few days later.
* Camera phone video and photographs taken in the immediate aftermath of the 7 July 2005 London bombings were featured worldwide. CNN executive Jonathan Klein predicts camera phone footage will be increasingly used by news organizations.
* Camera phone digital images helped to spread the 2009 Iranian election protests.
* Camera phones recorded the BART Police shooting of Oscar Grant.

== Camera phone photography ==
Photography produced specifically with phone cameras has become an art form in its own right. Work in this genre is sometimes referred to with the blend word &quot;iPhoneography&quot; (whether for photographs taken with an iPhone, or any brand of smart phone). The movement, though already a few years old, became mainstream with the advent of the iPhone and its App Store which provided better, easier, and more creative tools for people to shoot, process, and share their work.

Reportedly, the first gallery exhibition to feature iPhoneography exclusively opened on June 30, 2010: &quot;Pixels at an Exhibition&quot; was held in Berkeley, California, organized and curated by Knox Bronson and Rae Douglass. Around the same time, the photographer Damon Winter used Hipstamatic to make photos of the war in Afghanistan. A collection of these was published November 21, 2010, in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in a series titled &quot;A Grunt&#x27;s Life&quot;, earning an international award (3rd) sponsored by RJI, Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute. Also in Afghanistan, in 2011, photojournalist David Guttenfelder used an iPhone and the Polarize application. In 2013, &quot;National Geographic&quot; published a photo feature in which phoneographer Jim Richardson used his iPhone 5s to photograph the Scottish Highlands.

== Camera phone filmmaking ==
Since smartphones were equipped with video cameras, they came to be widely used for videography, and filmmakers gradually became interested in their capabilities. Mobile filmmaking is developing its own aesthetics due to its compactness, portability and its technological limitations that are being overcome every day by new implementations.

In this modern era, filmmakers all over the world take advantage of mobile phones&#x27; video recording abilities. Experimental works with the first generation mobile phones include &quot;New Love Meetings&quot; from 2005, a documentary film from Netherlands directed by Barbara Seghezzi and Marcello Mencarini, &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t Anybody Tell Me It Would Become This Bad in Afghanistan&quot; from 2007, the first narrative film shot with a mobile phone directed by Cyrus Frisch, &quot;SMS Sugar Man&quot; from 2008, a narrative film from South Africa by Aryan Kaganof, &quot;Veenavaadanam&quot; from 2008, the first Indian documentary film in the Malayalam language by Sathish Kalathil, and &quot;Jalachhayam&quot; from 2010, the first Indian narrative film in Malayalam, also by Sathish Kalathil.

High pixel smartphones are sometimes used as the main camera for mainstream films. Examples for films shot on smartphones include &quot;Hooked Up&quot; from Spain in 2013 by Pablo Larcuen, &quot;To Jennifer&quot; from the United States in 2013 by James Cullen Bressack, &quot;Tangerine&quot; from the United States in 2015 by Sean Baker, &quot;9 Rides&quot; from United States in 2015 by Matthew A. Cherry, &quot;Unsane&quot; from the United States in 2018 by Steven Soderbergh, &quot;High Flying Bird&quot; from the United States in 2019 by Steven Soderbergh, &quot;I WeirDo&quot; from Taiwan in 2020 by Liao Ming-yi, and &quot;Banger&quot; by Adam Sedlak from the Czech Republic in 2022.

<text>Ent Air Force Base was a United States Air Force base located in the Knob Hill neighborhood of Colorado Springs, Colorado. A tent city, established in 1943 during construction of the base, was initially commanded by Major General Uzal Girard Ent (1900–1948), for whom the base is named. The base was opened in 1951.

From 1957 to 1963, the base was the site of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which subsequently moved to the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. The base became the Ent Annex to the Cheyenne Mountain facility in 1975. The base was closed in 1976. The site later became the location of the United States Olympic Training Center, which was completed in July 1978.

==Background==
The first Air Defense Command was established on 26 February 1940, by the War Department. On 2 March 1940, it was put under the First Army Commander. It managed air defense within four geographic air districts. It was inactivated in mid-1944 when the threat of air attack seemed minimal.

With the beginning of the Cold War, American defense experts and political leaders began planning and implementing a defensive air shield, which they believed was necessary to defend against a possible attack by long-range, manned Soviet bombers. The Air Defense Command was established 21 March 1946 and the major command was established at Mitchel Field (later Mitchel Air Force Base) in New York on 27 March 1946, which was commanded by Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer.

By the time of the United States Air Force creation in 1947, as a separate service, it was widely acknowledged the Air Force would be the center point of this defensive effort. The Air Force established the Continental Air Command under both the Air Defense Command and Tactical Air Command on 1 December 1948, at which time Commanding General Gordon P. Saville (later Major General) took command. The Air Defense Command was inactivated as a major command on 1 July 1950. The Air Defense Command was reconstituted by the United States Air Force 1 January 1951, to protect the United States air space, with two geographically based organizations. The portion of the country east of the 103rd meridian was managed by the Eastern Air Defense Force (also First Air Force territory). The command for the Western Air Defense Force (also Second Air Force territory) was at Ent Air Force Base. The functions included an early warning system to identify and respond to impending air attacks, including fighter interception. Subordinate Air Force commands were given responsibility to protect the various regions of the United States.

==Colorado Springs Tent Camp==

The Colorado Springs Tent Camp was the headquarters for the Second Air Force beginning early June 1943. It was moved from Fort George Wright in the state of Washington to the more central location within the western half of the United States—the Second Air Force territory. The tent city was used for soldiers who worked on the conversion of the National Methodist Sanatorium for military use and construction of additional buildings for the base. Beginning in 1943, the Second Air Force was commanded by Major General Uzal Girard Ent who became the Commanding General after having been the Chief of Staff. Ent retired due to disability in the line of duty, due to injuries he sustained in a B-25 crash in October 1944 during takeoff. He died on 5 March 1948. Major General Robert B. Williams became the commanding officer of the Second Air Force in October 1944; he retired 1 July 1946.

The facility became inactive when the 15th Air Force headquarters was assigned to March Air Force Base in November 1949. There were discussions about the city taking over the now unused property, but in November 1950, it was announced that the base was to become the headquarters for the Air Defense Command.

==Air Force Base==

===Air Defense Command===

On 1 January 1951, the Air Defense Command was reestablished at Mitchel Air Force Base, under the command of Commanding General Ennis Whitehead, later lieutenant general. One week later the command was moved to Colorado Springs. The Ent Air Force Base, named for Major General Uzal Girard Ent, opened on 8 January 1951. The Air Defense Command (ADC) inherited 21 fighter squadrons from Continental Air Command (CONAD) and 37 Air National Guard (ANG) fighter squadrons assigned an M-Day air defense mission. It was also assigned four Air Divisions (Defense). General Benjamin W. Chidlaw was the base commander beginning 29 July 1951 and commander of the Air Defense Command from 25 August 1951 and until 31 May 1955.

The Senate appropriated an additional $3 million for expansion of the base in September 1951. The Peterson Air Force Base, which became inactive in 1949 when the 15th Air Force was moved to the March Air Force Base, was activated when the Ent Air Force Base opened. At the same time, the 4600th Air Base Group was activated to provide support for Ent. The funding was part of a military expansion initiative for the Ent Air Force Base, Fort Carson, and Peterson Air Force Base, all in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Much of the construction at Ent was for additional residential facilities. The Air Defense Command began 24-hour Ground Observer Corps operations on 14 July 1952. Starting September 1953, the base was the headquarters for the Army Anti-Aircraft Command.

Information about potential hostile aircraft from radar sites around the country was forwarded to a regional clearinghouse, like Otis Air National Guard Base, and then to ADC headquarters at Ent Air Force Base. It was then plotted on the world&#x27;s largest Plexiglas board. Enemy bombers progress was tracked on the board using grease pencils. If there was a potential threat, interceptor aircraft were scrambled to the target. Because this process was cumbersome, it made a rapid response unattainable. An automated command and control system, Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE), based upon the Whirlwind II (AN/FSQ-7) computer was implemented to process ground radar and other sources for an immediate view of potential threats in the 1950s. There was an operational plan for a SAGE implementation for Ent by 7 March 1955.

A modern concrete block Combat Operations Center (COC) became operational at the base on 15 May 1954. 1 September of that year, the Continental Air Defense Command (CONAD) was activated as a joint command at Ent AFB:
* Air Defense Command was the United States Air Force component command
* Army Antiaircraft Command was the Army component
* Naval Forces CONAD was the Navy component (NAVFORCONAD), established at Ent. CONAD forces were committed to the Contiguous Radar Coverage System and of augmentation forces for all services made available during emergency periods.

The Colorado Springs Chamber of Commerce purchased 8.1 acres of land and donated it to the Ent Air Force Base, making it a permanent installation on 31 July 1954. In September of that year, the base became the headquarters of Continental Air Defense Command. More than $19 million was targeted in 1955 for further military expansion in the area, including the Fort Carson, the Ent Air Force Base, and the development of the Air Force Academy.

On 15 January 1956, General Earle E. Partridge, CINCONAD, directed his staff to begin preliminary planning for a Combat Operations Center to be located underground. Partridge believed his present above ground center, located on Ent Air Force Base was too small to manage the growing air defense system and was highly vulnerable to sabotage or attack. Partridge was made commander in 1955, was the driving force behind the creation of the Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. He requested an underground facility in December 1956.

Continental Air Command (CONAD) and the Air Defense Command (ADC) formally separated in 1956. Partridge was relieved of his command of CONAD and Lt. General Joseph H. Atkinson assumed control of ADC.

The &quot;Interceptor&quot; magazine was produced by the Air Defense Command at the Ent Air Force Base by 1959 and then the Aerospace Defense Command into the mid-1970s.

===NORAD===
The North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) was established and activated at the base on 12 September 1957. This command is an international organization, taking operational control of Canadian Air Defense Command air defense units and United States Air Defense Command air defense units. The first NORAD Agreement was drafted. Partridge was Commander-in-Chief, CONAD also became commander of NORAD. Royal Canadian Air Force Air Marshal Roy Slemon became deputy commander, NORAD. The official agreement between the two countries was signed 12 May 1958.

In 1958, the base put $36,904,558 into the Colorado Springs economy in the form of pay to 3,639 military and 1,222 civilian personnel and dependents allowances, which was more than $7 million more than the previous year. These numbers exclude individuals that work for 15 U.S. industries—such as Boeing and Lockheed Aircraft—on Ent. Due to improvements in radar technology, the Ground Observer Corps was inactivated on 31 July 1959.

The NORAD commander issued instructions on 21 April 1961, concerning the 425L command and control computer system operational philosophy, including use by NORAD and component personnel, NORAD entry to sufficiently enable him to evaluate indications presented, the requirements for human judgment in determining the
validity of individual system indications, and identification of data as to source system.

===Cheyenne Mountain transition===

Excavation began for NORAD Command Operations Center (COC) in Cheyenne Mountain on 18 May 1961. The official ground breaking ceremony was held 16 June 1961 at the construction site of the new NORAD Combat Operations Center. Generals Lee (ADC) and Laurence S. Kuter (NORAD) simultaneously set off symbolic dynamite charges. Estimated cost of the combat operations center construction and equipment was $66 million.

===Ent Annex===

The 9th Aerospace Defense Division was activated at Ent Air Force Base on 15 July 1961. It was the
first large military space organization in the western world. The first Aerospace Surveillance and Control Squadron were assigned to the 9 ADD.

The Air Defense Command&#x27;s SPACETRACK Center and NORAD&#x27;s Space Detection and Tracking System (SPADATS) Center merged to form the Space Defense Center. It was moved from Ent AFB to the newly completed Cheyenne Mountain Combat Operations Center and was activated on 3 September 1965.

A Major General was assigned as the first Director of the Combat Operations Center as recommended by the Cheyenne Mountain Complex Task Force Study Report on 1 October 1965. This established a separate Battle Staff organization. The Director was responsible directly to CINCNORAD for tactical matters and the Joint Chiefs of
Staff for all others. CINCNORAD transferred Combat Operations Center operations from Ent Air Force Base to Cheyenne Mountain and declared the 425L command and control system fully operational 20 April 1966. On 20 May 1966, the NORAD Attack Warning System became operational. The Space Defense Center and the Combat Operations Center achieved Full Operational Capability on 6 February 1967. The total cost was $142.4 million.

The Fourteenth Aerospace Force was activated on 1 Jul 1968, at Ent AFB, Colorado. It inherited the staff and mission of the 9th Aerospace Defense Division, which was discontinued. The First Aerospace Control Squadron was then reassigned to the 14th Aerospace Force.

The Air Defense Command was re-designated as the Aerospace Defense Command on 15 January 1968. The Continental Air Defense Command and Aerospace Defense Command headquarters began consolidation and streamlining on 1 July 1973.

The Department of Defense announced plans for cutbacks in air defense forces showing increasing emphasis on ballistic missile attack warning and decreasing emphasis on bomber defense on 4 February 1974. The Continental Air Defense Command de-established on 30 June 1974.

==Inactivation==
The US Army Air Defense command, a component command of the North American Air Defense Command and Continental Air Command, was inactivated at Ent AFB, Colorado on 4 January 1975.

The 14th Aerospace Force, Ent AFB, Colorado was inactivated and its personnel and units (missile and space surveillance) were reassigned to HQ ADCOM and ADCOM divisions and the Alaskan ADCOM Region on 1 October 1976.
Ent Air Force Base was declared excess. In December 1976, personnel were moved to Peterson Air Force Base and the Chidlaw Building, near downtown Colorado Springs. The Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated on 31 March 1980.

<doc id="667170" wikidata="Q116761507" url="?curid=667170" title="Code completion">
<text>Code completion is an autocompletion feature in many integrated development environments (IDEs) that speeds up the process of coding applications by fixing common mistakes and suggesting lines of code. This usually happens through popups while typing, querying parameters of functions, and query hints related to syntax errors. Modern code completion software typically uses generative artificial intelligence systems to predict lines of code. Code completion and related tools serve as documentation and disambiguation for variable names, functions, and methods, using static analysis.

The feature appears in many programming environments. Implementations include IntelliSense in Visual Studio Code. The term was originally popularized as &quot;picklist&quot; and some implementations still refer to it as such.

==Overview==

Intelligent code completion, which is similar to other autocompletion systems, is a convenient way to access descriptions of functions—and in particular their parameter lists. The feature speeds up software development by reducing keyboard input and the necessity for name memorization. It also allows for users to refer less frequently to external documentation, as interactive documentation on many symbols (i.e. variables and functions) in the active scope appears dynamically in the form of tooltips.

Intelligent code completion uses an automatically generated in-memory database of classes, variable names, and other constructs that given computer code defines or references. The &quot;classic&quot; implementation of IntelliSense works by detecting &quot;marker characters&quot; such as periods (or other separator characters, depending on the language). When the user types one of these characters immediately after the name of an entity having one or more accessible members (such as contained variables or functions), IntelliSense suggests matches in a pop-up dialog. The user can either accept the suggestion by typing a statement-completion character ( or ) or a language-specific marker (such as the semicolon for C++), or continue typing the name. Over time, IntelliSense determines which variable or function the user most likely needs. IntelliSense also displays a short description of a function in the pop-up window—depending on the amount of documentation in the function&#x27;s source code.

The feature also lets users select from a number of overloaded functions in languages that support object-oriented programming. Some code editing software provide intelligent code completion through a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.

==History==
Research on intelligent code completion began in 1957, with spelling checkers for bitmap images of cursive writing and special applications to find records in databases despite incorrect entries. In 1961, Les Earnest, who headed the research on this budding technology, saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10,000 acceptable words. Ralph Gorin, a graduate student under Earnest at the time, created the first true spell-check program written as an application (rather than research) for general English text. SPELL, for the DEC PDP-10 at Stanford University&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), was published in February 1971. Gorin wrote the program in assembly for faster action; he made it by searching a word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent-letter transpositions, and presenting them to the user. Gorin made SPELL publicly accessible, as was done with most SAIL programs, and it soon spread around the world via the then-new ARPANET, about a decade before personal computers came into general use. SPELL and its algorithms and data structures inspired the Unix program Ispell.

==Support in editors and IDEs==
=== Visual Studio ===
IntelliSense is Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of code completion, best known in Visual Studio. It was first introduced as a feature of a mainstream Microsoft product in 1996 building on many already invented concepts of code completion and syntax checking, with the Visual Basic 5.0 Control Creation Edition, which was essentially a publicly available prototype for Visual Basic 5.0. Initially, Visual Basic IDE was the primary &quot;test bed&quot; for the technology, but IntelliSense was incorporated into Visual FoxPro and Visual C++ in the Visual Studio 97 timeframe (one revision after first seen in Visual Basic). Because it was based on the introspection capabilities of COM, the Visual Basic versions of IntelliSense were always more robust and complete than the 5.0 and 6.0 (97 and 98 in the Visual Studio naming sequence) versions of Visual C++, which did not have the benefit of being entirely based on COM. These shortcomings (criticized by many VC++ developers since the 97 release) have been largely corrected in the .NET product lines. For example, one of the most requested capabilities missing from the pre-.NET products was support for templates, which is now fully implemented.

IntelliSense has entered a new phase of development with the unified Visual Studio.NET environment first released in 2001, augmented by the more powerful introspection and code documentation capabilities provided by the .NET framework. IntelliSense is now supported by the Visual Studio editors for C++, C#, J#, Visual Basic, XML, HTML and XSLT among others. As of Visual Studio 2005, IntelliSense is now activated by default when the user begins to type, instead of requiring marker characters (though this behavior can be turned off). The IDE has the capability of inferring a greater amount of context based on what the developer is typing, to the point that basic language constructs such as and are also included in the choice list. In 2017 Microsoft announced IntelliCode, which uses machine learning to infer exactly which language or library feature is likely to be intended at every keystroke. Initially available as an extension for C# only, it is expected to be built in to future releases of Visual Studio.

Visual Studio 2022 includes artificial-intelligence features, such as GitHub Copilot, which can automatically suggest entire lines of code based on surrounding context.

Other Microsoft products that incorporate IntelliSense include Expression Web, FrontPage 2003, Small Basic, the Visual Basic for Applications IDEs in the Microsoft Office products, Visual Studio Code and many others. SQL Server 2008 Management Studio has autocomplete for the SQL syntax.

=== Eclipse ===
The Eclipse IDE has code completion tools that come packaged with the program. It includes notable support for Java, C++, and JavaScript code authoring.
The Code Recommenders Eclipse project used to provide powerful intelligent completion, but due to lack of resources, was dropped in Eclipse 2018–12, and then archived in July 2019.

===Vim===

Vim Intellisense is an advanced code completion system for the Vim editor.

== Example ==

Assume a C++ application being edited in Visual Studio has a class with some member functions:
class Foo {
 public:
 void bar();
 void foo_bar(char c, int n);


When the developer references this class in source code, e.g.:
Foo foo;
foo.
as soon as the user types the period after &quot;codice_1&quot;, IntelliSense automatically lists all the available member functions (i.e. codice_2 and codice_3) and all the available member attributes (private and protected members can be identified by a padlock picture beside their names). The user can then select one by using the arrow keys and hitting a completion character when the correct member function is highlighted. When available, IntelliSense displays a short description of the member function as given in the source code documentation.

IntelliSense goes further by indicating the required parameters in another pop-up window as the user fills in the parameters. As the user types a variable name, the feature also makes suggestions to complete the variable as they are typed. IntelliSense continues to show parameters, highlighting the pertinent one, as the user types.

The user can &quot;force&quot; IntelliSense to show its pop-up list without context by using or . In Visual Studio this displays the entire application domain object model available to the developer.

<doc id="667175" wikidata="Q1509647" url="?curid=667175" title="Hermitian adjoint">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in operator theory, each linear operator formula_1 on an inner product space defines a Hermitian adjoint (or adjoint) operator formula_2 on that space according to the rule

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the inner product on the vector space.

The adjoint may also be called the Hermitian conjugate or simply the Hermitian after Charles Hermite. It is often denoted by in fields like physics, especially when used in conjunction with bra–ket notation in quantum mechanics. In finite dimensions where operators can be represented by matrices, the Hermitian adjoint is given by the conjugate transpose (also known as the Hermitian transpose).

The above definition of an adjoint operator extends verbatim to bounded linear operators on Hilbert spaces formula_5. The definition has been further extended to include unbounded &quot;densely defined&quot; operators, whose domain is topologically dense in, but not necessarily equal to, formula_6

== Informal definition ==

Consider a linear map formula_7 between Hilbert spaces. Without taking care of any details, the adjoint operator is the (in most cases uniquely defined) linear operator formula_8 fulfilling 
:formula_9

where formula_10 is the inner product in the Hilbert space formula_11, which is linear in the first coordinate and conjugate linear in the second coordinate. Note the special case where both Hilbert spaces are identical and formula_12 is an operator on that Hilbert space.

When one trades the inner product for the dual pairing, one can define the adjoint, also called the transpose, of an operator formula_13, where formula_14 are Banach spaces with corresponding norms formula_15. Here (again not considering any technicalities), its adjoint operator is defined as formula_16 with
:formula_17

i.e., formula_18 for formula_19.

The above definition in the Hilbert space setting is really just an application of the Banach space case when one identifies a Hilbert space with its dual (via the Riesz representation theorem). Then it is only natural that we can also obtain the adjoint of an operator formula_20, where formula_5 is a Hilbert space and formula_22 is a Banach space. The dual is then defined as formula_23 with formula_24 such that 
:formula_25

== Definition for unbounded operators between Banach spaces ==
Let formula_26 be Banach spaces. Suppose formula_27 and formula_28, and suppose that formula_12 is a (possibly unbounded) linear operator which is densely defined (i.e., formula_30 is dense in formula_22). Then its adjoint operator formula_2 is defined as follows. The domain is
:formula_33

Now for arbitrary but fixed formula_34 we set formula_35 with formula_36. By choice of formula_37 and definition of formula_38, f is (uniformly) continuous on formula_30 as formula_40. Then by the Hahn–Banach theorem, or alternatively through extension by continuity, this yields an extension of formula_41, called formula_42, defined on all of formula_22. This technicality is necessary to later obtain formula_2 as an operator formula_45 instead of formula_46 Remark also that this does not mean that formula_12 can be extended on all of formula_22 but the extension only worked for specific elements formula_49.

Now, we can define the adjoint of formula_12 as
:formula_51

The fundamental defining identity is thus

:formula_52 for formula_53

== Definition for bounded operators between Hilbert spaces ==
Suppose is a complex Hilbert space, with inner product formula_54. Consider a continuous linear operator (for linear operators, continuity is equivalent to being a bounded operator). Then the adjoint of is the continuous linear operator satisfying

: formula_55

Existence and uniqueness of this operator follows from the Riesz representation theorem.

This can be seen as a generalization of the &quot;adjoint&quot; matrix of a square matrix which has a similar property involving the standard complex inner product.

== Properties ==
The following properties of the Hermitian adjoint of bounded operators are immediate:
# Involutivity: 
# If is invertible, then so is , with formula_56
# Conjugate linearity:
#* , where denotes the complex conjugate of the complex number 
# &quot;Anti-distributivity&quot;: 

If we define the operator norm of by
:formula_57

then
:formula_58

Moreover,
:formula_59

One says that a norm that satisfies this condition behaves like a &quot;largest value&quot;, extrapolating from the case of self-adjoint operators.

The set of bounded linear operators on a complex Hilbert space together with the adjoint operation and the operator norm form the prototype of a C*-algebra.

== Adjoint of densely defined unbounded operators between Hilbert spaces ==
===Definition===
Let the inner product formula_60 be linear in the &quot;first&quot; argument. A densely defined operator from a complex Hilbert space to itself is a linear operator whose domain is a dense linear subspace of and whose values lie in . By definition, the domain of its adjoint is the set of all for which there is a satisfying
: formula_61

Owing to the density of formula_30 and Riesz representation theorem, formula_63 is uniquely defined, and, by definition, formula_64

Properties 1.–5. hold with appropriate clauses about domains and codomains. For instance, the last property now states that is an extension of if , and are densely defined operators.

===ker A=(im A)===
For every formula_65 the linear functional formula_66 is identically zero, and hence formula_67

Conversely, the assumption that formula_68 causes the functional formula_69 to be identically zero. Since the functional is obviously bounded, the definition of formula_2 assures that formula_71 The fact that, for every formula_72 formula_73 shows that formula_74 given that formula_30 is dense.

This property shows that formula_76 is a topologically closed subspace even when formula_38 is not.

===Geometric interpretation===
If formula_78 and formula_79 are Hilbert spaces, then formula_80 is a Hilbert space with the inner product

:formula_81

where formula_82 and formula_83

Let formula_84 be the symplectic mapping, i.e. formula_85 Then the graph
:formula_86
of formula_87 is the orthogonal complement of formula_88
:formula_89

The assertion follows from the equivalences

:formula_90

and

:formula_91

====Corollaries====
=====A is closed=====
An operator formula_12 is &quot;closed&quot; if the graph formula_93 is topologically closed in formula_94 The graph formula_95 of the adjoint operator formula_2 is the orthogonal complement of a subspace, and therefore is closed.

=====A is densely defined ⇔ A is closable=====
An operator formula_12 is &quot;closable&quot; if the topological closure formula_98 of the graph formula_93 is the graph of a function. Since formula_100 is a (closed) linear subspace, the word &quot;function&quot; may be replaced with &quot;linear operator&quot;. For the same reason, formula_12 is closable if and only if formula_102 unless formula_103

The adjoint formula_87 is densely defined if and only if formula_12 is closable. This follows from the fact that, for every formula_106

:formula_107

which, in turn, is proven through the following chain of equivalencies:
:formula_108

=====A = A=====
The &quot;closure&quot; formula_109 of an operator formula_12 is the operator whose graph is formula_111 if this graph represents a function. As above, the word &quot;function&quot; may be replaced with &quot;operator&quot;. Furthermore, formula_112 meaning that formula_113

To prove this, observe that formula_114 i.e. formula_115 for every formula_116 Indeed,
:formula_117
In particular, for every formula_118 and every subspace formula_119 formula_120 if and only if formula_121 Thus, formula_122 and formula_123 Substituting formula_124 obtain formula_125

=====A = (A)=====
For a closable operator formula_126 formula_127 meaning that formula_128 Indeed,
:formula_129

===Counterexample where the adjoint is not densely defined===
Let formula_130 where formula_131 is the linear measure. Select a measurable, bounded, non-identically zero function formula_132 and pick formula_133 Define

:formula_134

It follows that formula_135 The subspace formula_30 contains all the formula_137 functions with compact support. Since formula_138 formula_12 is densely defined. For every formula_140 and formula_141

:formula_142

Thus, formula_143 The definition of adjoint operator requires that formula_144 Since formula_132 this is only possible if formula_146 For this reason, formula_147 Hence, formula_2 is not densely defined and is identically zero on formula_149 As a result, formula_12 is not closable and has no second adjoint formula_151

== Hermitian operators==
A bounded operator is called Hermitian or self-adjoint if
:formula_152

which is equivalent to
:formula_153

In some sense, these operators play the role of the real numbers (being equal to their own &quot;complex conjugate&quot;) and form a real vector space. They serve as the model of real-valued observables in quantum mechanics. See the article on self-adjoint operators for a full treatment.

== Adjoints of conjugate-linear operators ==
For a conjugate-linear operator the definition of adjoint needs to be adjusted in order to compensate for the complex conjugation. An adjoint operator of the conjugate-linear operator on a complex Hilbert space is an conjugate-linear operator with the property:

: formula_154

== Other adjoints ==
The equation
: formula_155

is formally similar to the defining properties of pairs of adjoint functors in category theory, and this is where adjoint functors got their name from.

<text>Typing is the process of writing or inputting text by pressing keys on a typewriter, computer keyboard, mobile phone, or calculator. It can be distinguished from other means of text input, such as handwriting and speech recognition. Text can be in the form of letters, numbers and other symbols. The world&#x27;s first typist was Lillian Sholes from Wisconsin in the United States, the daughter of Christopher Latham Sholes, who invented the first practical typewriter.

User interface features such as spell checker and autocomplete serve to facilitate and speed up typing and to prevent or correct errors the typist may make.

==Techniques==

===Hunt and peck===
Hunt and peck (&quot;two-fingered typing&quot;) is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight. Although good accuracy may be achieved, the use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from the keys, and any typing errors that are made may not be noticed immediately. Due to the fact that only a few fingers are used in this technique, this also means that the fingers are forced to move a much greater distance.
===Touch typing===

In this technique, the typist keeps their eyes on the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists rest their wrist down, rather than lifting up and typing (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome ). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.

Many touch typists also use keyboard shortcuts when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the key plus the key to save a document as they type, or the key plus the key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the key plus the to copy and the key and the key to paste, and the key and the key to cut. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes.

===Hybrid===
There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style &quot;hunt and peck&quot; and touch typing. For example, many &quot;hunt and peck&quot; typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3–6 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.

One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists. According to the study, &quot;The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.&quot; To quote Prof. Dr. Anna Feit: &quot;We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average.&quot;

===Thumbing===
A late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is &quot;thumbing&quot; or thumb typing. This can be accomplished using either only one thumb or both the thumbs, with more proficient typists reaching speeds of 100 words per minute. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other repetitive strain injury.

==Words per minute==

Words per minute (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in recruitment. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, &quot;brown&quot; counts as one word, but &quot;mozzarella&quot; counts as two.

The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an Afrikaans-speaking operator in Cape Town can be compared with a French-speaking operator in Paris.

Today, even Written Chinese can be typed very quickly using the combination of a software prediction system and by typing their sounds in Pinyin. Such prediction software even allows typing short-hand forms while producing complete characters. For example, the phrase &quot;nǐ chī le ma&quot; (你吃了吗) meaning &quot;Have you eaten yet?&quot; can be typed with just 4 strokes: &quot;nclm&quot;.

===Alphanumeric entry===
In one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition. In the same study, when the group was divided into &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; groups, the average speeds were 40 wpm, 35 wpm, and 23 wpm respectively. An average professional typist reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm. Two-finger typists, sometimes also referred to as &quot;hunt and peck&quot; typists, commonly reach sustained speeds of about 37 wpm for memorized text and 27 wpm when copying text, but in bursts may be able to reach speeds of 60 to 70 wpm. From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.

A less common measure of the speed of a typist, CPM is used to identify the number of characters typed per minute. This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person&#x27;s typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (pages per minute).

216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an IBM electric using the QWERTY keyboard layout. 
The Associated Press reported Barbara Blackburn achieving a speed of 194 wpm in October 1984 using the MasterType typing game. In a January 1985 story in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Blackburn said she had recently reached 196 wpm. During her &quot;Late Night&quot; appearance on January 24, 1985, she claimed to have achieved 170 wpm on minute tests, and 200 wpm using a computer. In May 1985, &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; reported that Blackburn said she had &quot;attained speeds of 212 words a minute for a brief time&quot; using an Apple computer keyboard and the Dvorak layout.

The recent emergence of several competitive typing websites has allowed fast typists on computer keyboards to emerge along with new records, though many of these are unverifiable. Some notable, records include 255 wpm on a one-minute, random-word test by a user under the username slekap and occasionally bailey, 213 wpm on a 1-hour, random-word test by Joshua Hu, 221 wpm average on 10 random quotes by Joshua Hu, and first place in the 2020 Ultimate Typing Championship by Anthony Ermollin based on an average of 180.88 wpm on texts of various lengths. All of their records were set on the QWERTY keyboard layout.

The current fastest typist is 17 year old who goes by the username &quot;MythicalRocket&quot;, with a speed of 305 WPM for 15 seconds using QWERTY.

Using a personalized interface, physicist Stephen Hawking, who suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, managed to type 15 wpm with a switch and adapted software created by Walt Woltosz. Due to a slowdown of his motor skills, his interface was upgraded with an infrared camera that detected &quot;twitches in the cheek muscle under the eye.&quot; His typing speed decreased to approximately one word per minute in the later part of his life.

===Numeric entry===
The numeric entry, or 10-key, speed is a measure of one&#x27;s ability to manipulate a numeric keypad. Generally, it is measured in keystrokes per hour (KPH).

==Text-entry research==
===Error analysis===
With the introduction of computers and word-processors, there has been a change in how text-entry is performed. In the past, using a typewriter, speed was measured with a stopwatch and errors were tallied by hand. With the current technology, document preparation is more about using word-processors as a composition aid, changing the meaning of error rate and how it is measured. Research performed by R. William Soukoreff and I. Scott MacKenzie, has led to a discovery of the application of a well-known algorithm. Through the use of this algorithm and accompanying analysis technique, two statistics were used, &quot;minimum string distance error rate&quot; (MSD error rate) and &quot;keystrokes per character&quot; (KSPC). The two advantages of this technique include:

*Participants are allowed to enter text naturally, since they may commit errors and correct them.
*The identification of errors and generation of error rate statistics is easy to automate.

====Deconstructing the text input process====
Through analysis of keystrokes, the keystrokes of the input stream were divided into four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following

*The two classes Correct and Incorrect Not Fixed comprise all of the characters in transcribed text. 
*Fixes (F) keystrokes are easy to identify, and include keystrokes such as backspace, delete, cursor movements, and modifier keys.
*Incorrect Fixed (IF) keystrokes are found in the input stream, but not the transcribed text, and are not editing keys.

Using these classes, the Minimum String Distance Error Rate and the Key Strokes per Character statistics can both be calculated.

====Minimum string distance error rate====
The minimum string distance (MSD) is the number of &quot;primitives&quot; which is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into another. The following equation was found for the MSD Error Rate.

&quot;MSD Error Rate&quot; = formula_1

====Key strokes per character (KSPC)====
With the minimum string distance error, errors that are corrected do not appear in the transcribed text. The following example shows why this can be an important class of errors to consider:

&quot;Presented Text&quot;: the quick brown
&quot;Input Stream&quot;: the quix&lt;-ck brown
&quot;Transcribed Text&quot;: the quick brown

In the above example, the incorrect character (&#x27;x&#x27;) was deleted with a backspace (&#x27;&lt;-&#x27;). Since these errors do not appear in the transcribed text, the MSD error rate is 0%. That is the purpose of the key strokes per character (KSPC) statistic.

&quot;KSPC&quot; = formula_2

There are some shortcomings of the KSPC statistic, such as:

* High KSPC values can be related to either many errors which were corrected, or few errors which were not corrected; however, there is no way to distinguish the two.
* KSPC depends on the text input method, and cannot be used to meaningfully compare two different input methods, such as a QWERTY keyboard and a multi-tap device.
* There is no obvious way to combine KSPC and MSD into an overall error rate, even though they have an inverse relationship.

====Further metrics====
Using the classes described above, further metrics were defined by R. William Soukoreff and I.Scott MacKenzie:

&quot;Error correction efficiency&quot; refers to the ease with which the participant performed error correction.
* &quot;Correction Efficiency&quot; = IF/F
&quot;Participant conscientiousness&quot; is the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of error, which helps distinguish perfectionists from apathetic participants.
* &quot;Participant Conscientiousness&quot; = IF / (IF + INF)
If C represents the amount of useful information transferred, INF, IF, and F represent the proportion of bandwidth wasted.
* &quot;Utilized Bandwidth&quot; = C / (C + INF + IF + F)
* &quot;Wasted Bandwidth&quot; = (INF + IF + F)/ (C + INF + IF + F)

====Total error rate====
The classes described also provide an intuitive definition of total error rate:

* &quot;Total Error Rate&quot; = ((INF + IF)/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%
* &quot;Not Corrected Error Rate&quot; = (INF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%
* &quot;Corrected Error Rate&quot; = (IF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%

Since these three error rates are ratios, they are comparable between different devices, something that cannot be done with the KSPC statistic, which is device dependent.

===Tools for text entry research===
Currently, two tools are publicly available for text entry researchers to record text entry performance metrics. The first is TEMA that runs only on the Android (operating system). The second is WebTEM that runs on any device with a modern Web browser, and works with almost all text entry technique.

==Keystroke dynamics==
Keystroke dynamics, or &quot;typing dynamics&quot;, is the obtaining of detailed timing information that describes exactly when each key was pressed and when it was released as a person is typing at a computer keyboard for biometric identification, similar to speaker recognition. Data needed to analyze keystroke dynamics is obtained by keystroke logging.

The behavioral biometric of Keystroke Dynamics uses the manner and rhythm in which an individual types characters on a keyboard or keypad.

<doc id="667188" wikidata="Q360187" url="?curid=667188" title="Adobe Fireworks">
<text>Adobe Fireworks (formerly Macromedia Fireworks) was a bitmap and vector graphics editor, which Adobe acquired in 2005. Fireworks was made for web designers for rapidly creating website prototypes and application interfaces. Its features included slices, which are segments of an image that are converted to HTML elements, and the ability to add hotspots, which are segments of an image that are converted to hyperlinks. It was designed to integrate with other Adobe products such as Adobe Dreamweaver and Adobe Flash. It was available as either a standalone product or bundled with Adobe Creative Suite. Older versions were bundled with Macromedia Studio. Adobe discontinued Fireworks in 2013, citing the increasing overlap in functionality with its other products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Edge.

==User interface==
Fireworks&#x27; user interface is consistent with the rest of Adobe Creative Suite, similar to that of Adobe Photoshop. On macOS, it is possible to display the application in multiple document interface mode or the standard viewing mode where all toolbars float freely on the screen.

==Features==

===Hierarchical layers===
All the layers can be accessed from the Layers panel. Layers may be wider or taller than the image itself. However, the final image is produced by hiding those areas that exit the image boundary.

===Smart guides===
Fireworks support &quot;guides&quot;, horizontal or vertical lines that act like a real-world ruler to help drawing, content placement and image composition. A user may place one or more guides on the image at any time and use it as a visual aid. For instance a guide is useful when a piece of text must be placed in line with another graphical item. Additionally, the user may enable the &quot;snap&quot; feature of the Fireworks, which causes objects (pieces of image, text or layers) drag to the vicinity of a guide to snap to it.

The &quot;smart guides&quot; however, are not placed by users. They are areas of the image that may interest the user such as the image boundaries, middle of the image or general boundaries of another object. When a user drags an object, Fireworks tries to guess what the user intends to do with the object and draws temporary visual and placement aids. This feature was added with the release of CS4.

===Symbols===
Reusable elements can be designated as &quot;symbols&quot; and placed at multiple pages or on the same page. When the master symbol is edited, Fireworks propagates the change to all instances of that symbol.

===9-slice scaling===
This feature ensures that rounded rectangles maintain their roundness when transformed depending on where the guides are placed. CS4 has this feature exposed as a tool. With this feature introduced in the CS3 version, its usage was limited to symbols.

===Image optimization===
Fireworks were created specifically for web production. Since not every user may be in possession of a fast Internet connection, it is in the best interest of the web developers to optimize the size of their digital contents. In terms of image compression, Fireworks has a better compression rate than Photoshop with JPEG, PNG and GIF images.

===Adobe Creative Suite integration===
Fireworks understands the Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator file formats (codice_1 and codice_2 files) as well as Encapsulated PostScript format (codice_3 files).

=== Export ===
Fireworks can export images to multiple file formats including PNG, JPEG, GIF, Animated GIF, TIFF, SWF, BMP, WBMP and PDF. It can also export to SVG (with the help of a free Export extension) and FXG 2.0. Fireworks can export to HTML by converting slices to HTML elements.

===States===
Previously known as &quot;frames&quot;, &quot;states&quot; are used for animation purposes. They are also used for defining behaviors in cases of symbol buttons like Up, Down, Over (changing the visual style of buttons on click, release, and hover with the mouse).

<doc id="667189" wikidata="Q1700964" url="?curid=667189" title="John Markoff">
<text>John Gregory Markoff (born October 24, 1949) is a journalist best known for his work covering technology at &quot;The New York Times&quot; for 28 years until his retirement in 2016, and a book and series of articles about the 1990s pursuit and capture of hacker Kevin Mitnick.

== Biography ==
Markoff was born in Oakland, California, and grew up in Palo Alto, California. He graduated from Whitman College, Walla Walla, Washington, with a B.A. in sociology in 1971. Additionally he received an M.A. in sociology from the University of Oregon in 1976.

After leaving graduate school, he returned to California where he began writing for Pacific News Service, an alternative news syndicate based in San Francisco. He freelanced for a number of publications including &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot; and &quot;Saturday Review&quot;. In 1981 he became part of the original staff of the computer industry weekly &quot;InfoWorld&quot;. In 1984 he became an editor at &quot;Byte Magazine&quot; and in 1985 he left to become a reporter in the business section of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, where he wrote about Silicon Valley.

In 1988 he moved to New York to write for the business section of the &quot;New York Times&quot;. In November 1988 he reported that Robert Tappan Morris, son of National Security Agency cryptographer Robert Morris, was the author of what would become known as the Internet worm.

In December 1993 he wrote an early article about the World Wide Web, referring to it as a &quot;map to the buried treasures of the Information Age.&quot;

===Markoff and Kevin Mitnick===
On July 4, 1994, he wrote an article about Kevin Mitnick, who was then a fugitive from a number of law enforcement agencies. He wrote several more pieces detailing Mitnick&#x27;s capture. Markoff also co-wrote, with Tsutomu Shimomura, the book &quot;Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America&#x27;s Most Wanted Computer Outlaw&quot; about the chase.

Markoff&#x27;s writing about Mitnick was the subject of criticism by Mitnick supporters and unaffiliated parties who maintained that Markoff&#x27;s accounts exaggerated or even invented Mitnick&#x27;s activities and successes. Markoff was also accused by Jonathan Littman of journalistic impropriety and of over-hyping Mitnick&#x27;s actual crimes. Littman published a more sympathetic account of Mitnick&#x27;s time as a fugitive in his own book on the incident, &quot;The Fugitive Game&quot;.
Markoff stood by his reporting.

The book later became a film that was released direct to video in the United States. The film went much further, with Markoff himself stating to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; in 2000, &quot;I thought it was a fundamentally dishonest movie.&quot; Mitnick stated that he settled a lawsuit with distributor Miramax over the film for an undisclosed sum.

===Post-Mitnick===
After Mitnick, Markoff continued to write about technology, focusing at times on wireless networking, writing early stories about non-line-of-sight broadband wireless, phased-array antennas, and multiple-in, multiple-out (MIMO) antenna systems to enhance Wi-Fi. He covered Jim Gillogly&#x27;s 1999 break of the first three sections of the CIA&#x27;s Kryptos cipher , and writes regularly about semiconductors and supercomputers as well. He wrote the first two articles describing Admiral John Poindexter&#x27;s return to government and the creation of the Total Information Awareness project. He shared the 2005 Gerald Loeb Award in the Deadline Writing category for the story &quot;End of an Era&quot;. In 2009 he moved from the Business/Tech section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; to the Science section.

Markoff contributed to the &quot;New York Times&quot; staff entry that received the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting. The series of 10 articles explored the business practices of Apple and other technology companies. He retired from his full-time position with &quot;The New York Times&quot; on December 1, 2016. He continues to work as a freelance journalist for the &quot;Times&quot; and other organizations and volunteers at the Computer History Museum. He is an affiliated fellow of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence.

Markoff is interviewed in &quot;Do You Trust This Computer?&quot;, a 2018 documentary on artificial intelligence.

<text>Command history is a feature in many operating system shells, computer algebra programs, and other software that allows the user to recall, edit and rerun previous commands. 

Command line history was added to Unix in Bill Joy&#x27;s C shell of 1978; Joy took inspiration from an earlier implementation in Interlisp. It quickly became popular because it made the C shell fast and easy to use. History has since become a standard feature in other shells, including ksh, Bash and Microsoft&#x27;s cmd.exe. History addressed two important scenarios:

# Executing the same command or a short sequence of commands over and over. An example might be a developer frequently compiling and running a program.
# Correcting mistakes or rerunning a command with only a small modification.

In Joy&#x27;s original C shell, the user could refer to a previous command by typing an exclamation, codice_1, followed by additional characters to specify a particular command, only certain words, or to edit it in some way before pasting it back into the command line. For example:

:codice_2 meant the entire previous command.
:codice_3 meant just the last word of the previous command.
:codice_4 meant the command that started with &quot;abc&quot;.

The usual implementation today is to combine history with command-line editing. The cursor keys are used to navigate up and down through the history list and left or right to anyplace on the line, where the user can simply type a desired change. But some implementations are menu-based: The user presses a certain function key which displays a menu of recent commands, which the user can select one by typing a number.

Some implementation such as Bash support to record command history to a file (codice_5 command).

<text>William Beckwith McInnes (18 May 1889 – 9 November 1939) was an Australian portrait painter, winner of the Archibald Prize seven times for his traditional style paintings. He was acting-director at the National Gallery of Victoria and an instructor in its art school.

==Early life==
McInnes was born in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne, to Malcolm McInnes and his wife Alice Agnes, née Beckwith. Despite lack of family artistic tradition, he was keen to draw from the time he could hold a pencil. In 1903, at 14 years of age, he enrolled in the drawing school of the National Gallery of Victoria under Frederick McCubbin. Later he moved up to the painting school under Lindsay Bernard Hall.

==Artistic career==
He won his first prizes for drawing the figure from life, and for painting a head from life, and shared the prize for a landscape in 1908.

Soon afterwards McInnes held a successful show of his paintings at the Melbourne Athenaeum Gallery in conjunction with F. R. Crozier, which was followed in 1911 by a journey to Europe where he did much landscape painting and made acquaintance with the masterpieces of Rembrandt, Velasquez and Raeburn.

McInnes was represented in London at the exhibition of the Royal Institute of Painters in oils in 1913.

He returned to Melbourne in the same year, where a one-man show was held at the Athenaeum gallery and nearly everything was sold. In 1916 he acted as locum tenens for Frederick McCubbin, master of the school of drawing at the National Gallery of Victoria, during McCubbin&#x27;s six months&#x27; leave of absence. McInnes was temporarily appointed to the position in 1918 after McCubbin&#x27;s death, and in 1920 he was permanently appointed.

In 1921, he won the first Archibald Prizes for portraiture. He went on to win the award a total of seven times.

McInnes revisited Europe in 1925 and found he was in great demand as a portrait painter. For many years he was unable to spare time to do landscape work. In 1927 he was commissioned by the Federal government to depict the opening of the first parliament in Canberra by the Duke of York. In 1928 he exhibited with the Royal Academy, and in 1933 he visited England again to paint the Duke of York (later King George VI).

In the following year when Bernard Hall left for England as adviser for the Felton bequest, McInnes was appointed acting-director of the National Gallery of Victoria, and on Hall&#x27;s death, was appointed head of the painting school. In 1937 McInnes became an invited foundation member of, and exhibited with, Robert Menzies&#x27; anti-modernist organisation, the Australian Academy of Art.

Amongst the many portraits by McInnes were those of the surgeons Archibald Watson and Wood Jones.

McInnes&#x27; artwork is featured at the Art Gallery of South Australia and the Art Gallery of NSW. In addition, McInnes has painted a variety of important people in Australian history including officials and aristocratic families.

==Late life==
McInnes suffered from an imperfect heart all his life. On 30 November 1937 around midnight the car he was driving struck and killed a pedestrian, James Lowrey, on Brunswick Street in Fitzroy. At the inquest evidence was brought forward that a drug (Luminal) he was taking for the condition could have affected his driving and been responsible for his staggering and not remembering details of the accident. He was not convicted of any offence.

His general health became affected and in July 1939 he resigned his position as master of the National Gallery art school. He died on 9 November 1939. He married Violet Muriel Musgrave in 1915, a capable flower painter, who survived him with four sons and two daughters.

==McInnes&#x27; Archibald Prize winners==
* 1921 - &quot;Desbrowe Annear&quot;
* 1922 - &quot;Professor Harrison Moore&quot;
* 1923 - &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot;

<doc id="667194" wikidata="Q692720" url="?curid=667194" title="American Gigolo">
<text>American Gigolo is a 1980 American neo-noir crime drama film written and directed by Paul Schrader, and starring Richard Gere and Lauren Hutton. It tells the story of a high-priced escort in Los Angeles (Gere) who becomes romantically involved with a prominent politician&#x27;s wife (Hutton), while simultaneously becoming the prime suspect in a murder case.

The film established Gere as a leading man, and was one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to include frontal male nudity from its main star. It is also notable for its Golden Globe–nominated musical score, composed by Giorgio Moroder, and number-one single &quot;Call Me&quot; by Blondie. Schrader considers it one of four similar films, which he calls &quot;double bookends&quot;: &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, bookended by &quot;Light Sleeper&quot;, and &quot;American Gigolo&quot; bookended by &quot;The Walker&quot;.

==Plot==
Julian Kay is a male escort in Los Angeles whose clientele are upper-class women. His job supports and requires an expensive taste in cars and clothes, and affords him a luxury Westwood apartment. He is blatantly materialistic, as he strives to merit inclusion into the class of people who make up his clientele. He takes pleasure in his work from being able to sexually satisfy women, offering and selling his body to women.

Julian&#x27;s procurer, Anne, sends him on an assignment with a wealthy old widow, Mrs. Dobrun, who is visiting town. Afterwards, he goes to the hotel bar and meets Michelle Stratton, a California state senator&#x27;s wife, who becomes obsessed with him. Julian&#x27;s pimp Leon sends him to Palm Springs on a &quot;substitute&quot; assignment to the house of Mr. Rheiman, a wealthy financier. Rheiman asks Julian to have sado-masochistic sex with his wife Judy while he is watching them. The next day, Julian berates Leon for sending him to a &quot;rough trick&quot; and makes it clear he declines kinky or gay assignments. Leon warns Julian that the wealthy, older women he serves will turn on him and discard him without a second thought.

As Julian begins to have a relationship with Michelle, he learns that Judy Rheiman has been murdered. Los Angeles Police Department Detective Sunday identifies Julian as the prime suspect. Though Julian was with Lisa Williams, another client, on the night of the murder, she protects her marriage by not providing an alibi for Julian.

Julian discovers evidence about the murder. He realizes that he is being framed and grows increasingly desperate. His clothes become rumpled, he goes unshaven and drives a cheap rental car (after painstakingly searching his Mercedes and finding Judy&#x27;s jewelry that was planted in it to frame him). He neglects to pick up an important client for Anne that he had been scheduled to escort, angering Anne and causing her to shun him. Julian warns Michelle that he is in trouble and, hoping to protect her, he tells her to leave him alone.

Julian concludes that Leon and Rheiman are the ones trying to frame him, and that one of Leon&#x27;s other gigolos was the murderer. Julian goes to confront Leon, telling him the truth and trying to clear his name. Leon refuses to help him and remains implacable. In a fit of rage, Julian pushes Leon from the apartment balcony; although Julian immediately regrets his action and tries to save him, Leon nevertheless falls to his death. With no one to help him, Julian ends up in jail, helplessly awaiting trial for Judy&#x27;s murder. Michelle reconciles with Julian by telling the police that she was with Julian the night of Judy&#x27;s murder, sacrificing her reputation and marriage to save him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Paul Schrader first conceived of the idea for the film while teaching screenwriting at UCLA&#x27;s film and television department. The script was one of five screenplays Schrader wrote in 1976. Schrader commented, &quot;The character in ″&quot;Taxi Driver&quot;″ was compulsively nonsexual. The character in ″&quot;American Gigolo&quot;″ is compulsively sexual. He is a man who receives his identity by giving sexual pleasure but has no concept of receiving sexual pleasure.&quot;

John Travolta was originally attached to the lead role, with his casting announced by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in January 1978. Travolta was provided a wardrobe by Giorgio Armani and appeared in a photo spread for the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; announcing his participation. The following year, Travolta dropped out of the production to deal with his mother&#x27;s death and father&#x27;s illness.

In Travolta&#x27;s absence, Barry Diller of Paramount Pictures offered the part of Julian Kay to Christopher Reeve, but Reeve turned down the million-dollar offer. Chevy Chase was also offered the role but declined. Schrader offered the part to his first choice, Richard Gere, who accepted. Gere was cast two weeks before shooting began. In 2012, Gere said he was drawn to the role partly because of its gay subtext, commenting,

This is not the only role Travolta turned down only to be taken by Gere: it had happened with &quot;Days of Heaven&quot; (1978) and occurred again when Travolta was offered the lead in &quot;An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; (1982) and &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002). Gere&#x27;s brief nude scenes marked the first time a major Hollywood actor was frontally nude in a film. According to Gere, the nudity was not in the original script.

Julie Christie was originally cast in the role of Michelle Stratton but her departure was precipitated by Gere&#x27;s replacement of Travolta. By the time Gere was cast, Lauren Hutton had already been hired. Meryl Streep was also offered the part of Michelle but declined because she did not like the tone of the film. Glenn Close also auditioned for a role when Travolta was still attached.

Schrader called &quot;Pickpocket&quot; (1959) by the French director Robert Bresson an influence on the film; the composition of the final shot pays homage to that film, as does the final dialogue. Schrader later provided an introduction to the Criterion Collection DVD of &quot;Pickpocket&quot;. On the film&#x27;s ending, Schrader writes: &quot;At the end of &quot;American Gigolo&quot;, I wanted to perversely plunge my lizardy protagonist into icy Bressonian waters, so I lifted the ending of &quot;Pickpocket&quot; and gave it to Julian Kay. A grace note as unwarranted as Christ&#x27;s promise to the thief on the cross&quot;. Schrader re-visited many of the themes of &quot;American Gigolo&quot; in his 2007 film &quot;The Walker&quot; and says the idea for that film came about while wondering what would have become of the Julian Kay character.

The film is widely credited to have established the Giorgio Armani brand in Hollywood because the Italian designer&#x27;s clothes are featured prominently in Julian Kay&#x27;s wardrobe. When Gere replaced Travolta as Julian, the designer&#x27;s team had to make new clothing for him as Travolta is tall, a few inches taller than Gere.

Filming began on February 13, 1979, and lasted until April 1979.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s musical score was composed by Giorgio Moroder, who was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. The main theme song of the film is &quot;Call Me&quot; performed by Blondie. The song was written by Moroder and Blondie vocalist Debbie Harry, and became a huge worldwide success in 1980. It peaked at number one in several countries including the US and the UK, and became the highest-selling single of 1980 in the United States. In 1981, the song was also nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Moroder and Harry further shared a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

==Reception==
Roger Ebert gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing, &quot;The whole movie has a winning sadness about it; take away the story&#x27;s sensational aspects and what you have is a study in loneliness.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; also awarded 3.5 stars out of 4 and called it &quot;an honest, compelling drama that sheds a little light in some beguilingly dark places.&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in a negative review that writer-director Schrader &quot;is awfully good at establishing inarticulate, unknowing, self-deluding characters, but he&#x27;s much less effective when it comes to shepherding these characters through the contingencies of the melodrama that is supposed to ennoble them or, at least, to reveal their unsuspected moral resources.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; faulted the film for an &quot;evasiveness at its core&quot;, finding a &quot;moral and emotional ambivalence&quot; in Gere&#x27;s character &quot;which makes caring about his predicament and ultimate fate difficult.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also negative, calling the film &quot;such an improbable tissue of fantasies and dime-novel borrowings that from moment to moment it seems to be making fun of itself, although the joke is disguised perfectly.&quot; Roger Angell of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the film &quot;presents a humorless, &quot;Penthouse&quot; kind of sex, all dolled up with expensive &#x27;real&#x27; settings, foreign cars, hi-fi sets, and designer clothes, but barely alive at its glum, soft core.&quot;

==Television series==
In October 2014, Jerry Bruckheimer announced plans to adapt the film into a television series. In October 2016, it was announced that Neil LaBute will write the series for Showtime. On June 15, 2021, Showtime gave production series order consists of ten episodes. David Hollander will be writing, directing, and showrunning the series. He is also expected to executive produce alongside Jerry Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman, and KristieAnne Reed. Jon Bernthal, Rosie O’Donnell, Lizzie Brocheré, and Leland Orser were cast in starring roles while Wayne Brady was cast to guest star.

<text>Robert Conrad Khayat (born April 18, 1938) is an American former academic administrator and football player who was the 15th chancellor of the University of Mississippi. He played football professionally as a placekicker, guard, and center for the Washington Redskins of the National Football League (NFL).

Khayat played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels and was selected in the sixth round of the 1960 NFL draft. He played for the Washington for three seasons, earning a Pro Bowl selection in 1960. After his football career, Khayat became a lawyer. He was appointed chancellor of the University of Mississippi in 1995.

==Early years==
Khayat was born in Moss Point, Mississippi, to Lebanese parents. His family attended a Methodist church where they sat in the back due to racial discrimination. He attended Moss Point High School and the University of Mississippi. He received both Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from the University of Mississippi. He also played football for the Ole Miss Rebels football team from 1957 to 1959. He also received an LL.M. degree from Yale University.

==Professional football career==
Khayat was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the 1960 NFL draft. He was then traded to the Washington Redskins along with lineman Fran O&#x27;Brien in April 1960 for veteran kicker Sam Baker. 

Khayat played for the Redskins during the 1960, 1962, and 1963 seasons. Following the 1960 season, he was named to the Pro Bowl squad. He appeared in a total of 40 NFL games and kicked 38 field goals and 90 extra points.

His brother Eddie Khayat also played and coached in the NFL.

==Later years==
Khayat later became a lawyer and taught law at the University of Mississippi School of Law.

He was appointed chancellor in 1995. In one of his first acts as chancellor, Khayat arranged for a $5.4 million gift from Jim and Sally Barksdale to establish an honors college at the university. In 1996, with enrollment declining, Khayat retained the public relations firm, Burson-Marsteller, to conduct a survey of public perception — including university symbols. When The New York Times reported on the review, which included the Confederate Flag and other Old South symbols, a media frenzy ensued.

On January 6, 2009, Khayat announced his retirement effective June 30, 2009. He was succeeded by Daniel Jones on June 15, 2009.

Khayat&#x27;s memoir, The Education of a Lifetime, was published on September 10, 2013.

<doc id="667199" wikidata="Q2358173" url="?curid=667199" title="Studebaker-Packard Hawk series">
<text>The Studebaker-Packard Hawk series were cars produced by the merged Studebaker-Packard corporation between 1956 and 1964. All but the 1958 Packard Hawk were badged Studebaker. Described by the company as &quot;family sports cars&quot;, they were all two-door, four-seat coupes and hardtops. They were an evolution of the long wheelbase (120&quot;) 1953 C/K models designed by Robert Bourke, lead designer with the Raymond Loewy Agency. The 1962 redesign as the GT Hawk was by another famed stylist, Brooks Stevens.

The precursor of the Hawks was the 1955 Studebaker Speedster, a special edition hardtop based on the Studebaker President with stainless steel trim above the rear window, usually fog lights on the front bumper, deluxe leather interior, a special dash and unique two tone paint combinations. The success of the Speedster led to the expanded line of 1956 Hawks as a competitor to the Ford Thunderbird and the Oldsmobile Starfire.

The four-model Hawk range launched in 1956, mirrored the engine and trim levels of the sedans. There were two coupes; the Flight Hawk was a base model powered by Champion&#x27;s obsolete and underpowered flathead straight-6 enlarged to 185.6 cubic inch; the Power Hawk used Studebaker&#x27;s mid-level OHV 259 cu. in. with either 2-bbl or with a 4-bbl in (4.7 L) V8 from the Commander; there were two hardtops; the Sky Hawk shared the larger OHV 289 in3 V8 and luxury trim with the Studebaker President, and Studebaker Golden Hawk, which stood at the top of the range. The Golden Hawk, fitted with Packard&#x27;s powerful big-block 352 cubic inch 275 hp (5.8 L) V8, was the best all-around high performance car of 1956. Some feel by installing the largest V8 in the smallest lightest body, Studebaker created the first muscle car eight years before the GTO. It had the second highest power-to-weight ratio of any American production car. Contemporary road tests verified the Golden Hawk was faster/quicker in the 1/4 mile than the Corvette, Thunderbird and Chrysler 300B. In top speed, only the Chrysler 300B could equal it.

By 1956, Studebaker-Packard&#x27;s financial condition had deteriorated to the point where there was no choice but to discontinue all manufacturing in the Packard facilities. Packard&#x27;s Detroit factory and Utica proving grounds were closed. In a stop-gap effort to buy time for the development and financing of an all-new Packard, and to honor existing dealer contracts, a 1957 Packard that was merely a dressed up Studebaker President went into production at Studebaker&#x27;s factory in South Bend. As Packard&#x27;s V8 was no longer being produced, the new Packard as well as the 1957 Golden Hawk were fitted with Studebaker&#x27;s largest 289 in3 V8, equipped with a McCulloch supercharger to produce the same rated power output as the 1956 Packard V8. The range was simplified; the Sky Hawk was discontinued as too close to the Golden Hawk, while the two lowest models were replaced with a single Silver Hawk model, available with either the Champion straight-6 or 259 cubic inch (4.2 L) V8. 1958 saw a restyled and re-badged luxury version of the Golden Hawk sold as the Packard Hawk. 

Studebaker sales continued a rapid decline in 1957-58, so for 1959 Studebaker-Packard discontinued the hardtop Golden Hawk, all Packards, and the Studebaker sedans; the Silver Hawk coupe was the only holdover left alongside the new Studebaker Lark range. It was a make-or-break year, but Studebaker&#x27;s big gamble paid off; the smaller-appearing Lark was actually just the six-year-old sedans with a shorter wheelbase and abbreviated front and rear sheetmetal, but it was in the right place at the right time, a car the market wanted. The Silver Hawk served as a useful showroom draw, and it was continued; since it was the only Hawk model left, it was renamed simply the Studebaker Hawk and continued under that name through the end of 1961.

For the 1962 model year, Brooks Stevens restyled the GT Hawk and it was launched as the Gran Turismo Hawk. Its styling was well received, and sold relatively well for 1962. By 1963, Studebaker sales were in an irreversible death spiral. Even though the 1964 Super Hawk, available with an optional R2 supercharged engine, 4-speed transmission, TwinTraction limited-slip differential, front disc brakes and a sport suspension, was the best Hawk ever, production was ended with the rest of Studebaker&#x27;s US production in December 1963.</text><links>

<text>A touchscreen (or touch screen) is a type of display that can detect touch input from a user. It consists of both an input device (a touch panel) and an output device (a visual display). The touch panel is typically layered on the top of the electronic visual display of a device. Touchscreens are commonly found in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other electronic devices. The display is often an LCD, AMOLED or OLED display.

A user can give input or control the information processing system through simple or multi-touch gestures by touching the screen with a special stylus or one or more fingers. Some touchscreens use ordinary or specially coated gloves to work, while others may only work using a special stylus or pen. The user can use the touchscreen to react to what is displayed and, if the software allows, to control how it is displayed; for example, zooming to increase the text size.

A touchscreen enables the user to interact directly with what is displayed, instead of using a mouse, touchpad, or other such devices (other than a stylus, which is optional for most modern touchscreens).

Touchscreens are common in devices such as smartphones, handheld game consoles, and personal computers. They are common in point-of-sale (POS) systems, automated teller machines (ATMs), electronic voting machines, and automobile infotainment systems and controls. They can also be attached to computers or, as terminals, to networks. They play a prominent role in the design of digital appliances such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and some e-readers. Touchscreens are important in educational settings such as classrooms or on college campuses.

The popularity of smartphones, tablets, and many types of information appliances has driven the demand and acceptance of common touchscreens for portable and functional electronics. Touchscreens are found in the medical field, heavy industry, automated teller machines (ATMs), and kiosks such as museum displays or room automation, where keyboard and mouse systems do not allow a suitably intuitive, rapid, or accurate interaction by the user with the display&#x27;s content.

Historically, the touchscreen sensor and its accompanying controller-based firmware have been made available by a wide array of after-market system integrators, and not by display, chip, or motherboard manufacturers. Display manufacturers and chip manufacturers have acknowledged the trend toward acceptance of touchscreens as a user interface component and have begun to integrate touchscreens into the fundamental design of their products.

==History==

One predecessor of the modern touchscreen includes stylus based systems.

1946 DIRECT LIGHT PEN - A patent was filed by Philco Company for a stylus designed for sports telecasting which, when placed against an intermediate cathode-ray tube (CRT) display would amplify and add to the original signal. Effectively, this was used for temporarily drawing arrows or circles onto a live television broadcast, as described in .

1962 OPTICAL - The first version of a touchscreen which operated independently of the light produced from the screen was patented by AT&amp;T Corporation . This touchscreen utilized a matrix of collimated lights shining orthogonally across the touch surface. When a beam is interrupted by a stylus, the photodetectors which no longer are receiving a signal can be used to determine where the interruption is. Later iterations of matrix based touchscreens built upon this by adding more emitters and detectors to improve resolution, pulsing emitters to improve optical signal to noise ratio, and a nonorthogonal matrix to remove shadow readings when using multi-touch.

1963 INDIRECT LIGHT PEN - Later inventions built upon this system to free telewriting styli from their mechanical bindings. By transcribing what a user draws onto a computer, it could be saved for future use. See .

1965 CAPACITANCE AND RESISTANCE - The first finger driven touchscreen was developed by Eric Johnson, of the Royal Radar Establishment located in Malvern, England, who described his work on capacitive touchscreens in a short article published in 1965 and then more fully—with photographs and diagrams—in an article published in 1967.

MID-60s ULTRASONIC CURTAIN - Another precursor of touchscreens, an ultrasonic-curtain-based pointing device in front of a terminal display, had been developed by a team around at Telefunken for an air traffic control system. In 1970, this evolved into a device named &quot;Touchinput-&quot; (&quot;touch input facility&quot;) for the SIG 50 terminal utilizing a conductively coated glass screen in front of the display. This was patented in 1971 and the patent was granted a couple of years later. The same team had already invented and marketed the mouse RKS 100-86 for the SIG 100-86 a couple of years earlier.

1968 CAPACITANCE - The application of touch technology for air traffic control was described in an article published in 1968. Frank Beck and Bent Stumpe, engineers from CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research), developed a transparent touchscreen in the early 1970s, based on Stumpe&#x27;s work at a television factory in the early 1960s. Then manufactured by CERN, and shortly after by industry partners, it was put to use in 1973.

1972 OPTICAL - A group at the University of Illinois filed for a patent on an optical touchscreen that became a standard part of the Magnavox Plato IV Student Terminal and thousands were built for this purpose. These touchscreens had a crossed array of 16×16 infrared position sensors, each composed of an LED on one edge of the screen and a matched phototransistor on the other edge, all mounted in front of a monochrome plasma display panel. This arrangement could sense any fingertip-sized opaque object in close proximity to the screen.

1973 MULTI-TOUCH CAPACITANCE - In 1973, Beck and Stumpe published another article describing their capacitive touchscreen. This indicated that it was capable of multi-touch but this feature was purposely inhibited, presumably as this was not considered useful at the time (&quot;A...variable...called BUT changes value from zero to five when a button is touched. The touching of other buttons would give other non-zero values of BUT but this is protected against by software&quot; (Page 6, section 2.6). &quot;Actual contact between a finger and the capacitor is prevented by a thin sheet of plastic&quot; (Page 3, section 2.3). At that time Projected capacitance had not yet been invented.

1977 RESISTIVE - An American company, Elographics – in partnership with Siemens – began work on developing a transparent implementation of an existing opaque touchpad technology, U.S. patent  3,911,215, October 7, 1975, which had been developed by Elographics&#x27; founder George Samuel Hurst. The resulting resistive technology touch screen was first shown on the World&#x27;s Fair at Knoxville in 1982.

1982 MULTI-TOUCH CAMERA - Multi-touch technology began in 1982, when the University of Toronto&#x27;s Input Research Group developed the first human-input multi-touch system, using a frosted-glass panel with a camera placed behind the glass.

1983 OPTICAL - An optical touchscreen was used on the HP-150 starting in 1983. The HP 150 was one of the world&#x27;s earliest commercial touchscreen computers. HP mounted their infrared transmitters and receivers around the bezel of a 9-inch Sony cathode ray tube (CRT).

1983 MULTI-TOUCH FORCE SENSING TOUCHSCREEN - Bob Boie of AT&amp;T Bell Labs, used capacitance to track the mechanical changes in thickness of a soft, deformable overlay membrane when one or more physical objects interact with it; the flexible surface being easily replaced, if damaged by these objects. The patent states &quot;the tactile sensor arrangements may be utilized as a touch screen&quot;. 

Many derivative sources retrospectively describe Boie as making a major advancement with his touchscreen technology; but no evidence has been found that a rugged multi-touch capacitive touchscreen, that could sense through a rigid, protective overlay - the sort later required for a mobile phone, was ever developed or patented by Boie. Many of these citations rely on anecdotal evidence from Bill Buxton of Bell Labs. However, Bill Buxton did not have much luck getting his hands on this technology. As he states in the citation: &quot;Our assumption (false, as it turned out) was that the Boie technology would become available to us in the near future. Around 1990 I took a group from Xerox to see this technology it [sic] since I felt that it would be appropriate for the user interface of our large document processors. This did not work out&quot;. 

UP TO 1984 CAPACITANCE - Although, as cited earlier, Johnson is credited with developing the first finger operated capacitive and resistive touchscreens in 1965, these worked by directly touching wires across the front of the screen.
Stumpe and Beck developed a self-capacitance touchscreen in 1972, and a mutual capacitance touchscreen in 1977. Both these devices could only sense the finger by direct touch or through a thin insulating film. This was 11 microns thick according to Stumpe&#x27;s 1977 report.

1984 TOUCHPAD - Fujitsu released a touch pad for the Micro 16 to accommodate the complexity of kanji characters, which were stored as tiled graphics.

1986 GRAPHIC TABLET - A graphic touch tablet was released for the Sega AI Computer.

EARLY 80s EVALUATION FOR AIRCRAFT - Touch-sensitive control-display units (CDUs) were evaluated for commercial aircraft flight decks in the early 1980s. Initial research showed that a touch interface would reduce pilot workload as the crew could then select waypoints, functions and actions, rather than be &quot;head down&quot; typing latitudes, longitudes, and waypoint codes on a keyboard. An effective integration of this technology was aimed at helping flight crews maintain a high level of situational awareness of all major aspects of the vehicle operations including the flight path, the functioning of various aircraft systems, and moment-to-moment human interactions.

EARLY 80s EVALUATION FOR CARS - also, in the early 1980s, General Motors tasked its Delco Electronics division with a project aimed at replacing an automobile&#x27;s non-essential functions (i.e. other than throttle, transmission, braking, and steering) from mechanical or electro-mechanical systems with solid state alternatives wherever possible. The finished device was dubbed the ECC for &quot;Electronic Control Center&quot;, a digital computer and software control system hardwired to various peripheral sensors, servomechanisms, solenoids, antenna and a monochrome CRT touchscreen that functioned both as display and sole method of input. The ECC replaced the traditional mechanical stereo, fan, heater and air conditioner controls and displays, and was capable of providing very detailed and specific information about the vehicle&#x27;s cumulative and current operating status in real time. The ECC was standard equipment on the 1985–1989 Buick Riviera and later the 1988–1989 Buick Reatta, but was unpopular with consumers—partly due to the technophobia of some traditional Buick customers, but mostly because of costly technical problems suffered by the ECC&#x27;s touchscreen which would render climate control or stereo operation impossible.

1985 GRAPHIC TABLET - Sega released the Terebi Oekaki, also known as the Sega Graphic Board, for the SG-1000 video game console and SC-3000 home computer. It consisted of a plastic pen and a plastic board with a transparent window where pen presses are detected. It was used primarily with a drawing software application.

1985 MULTI-TOUCH CAPACITANCE - The University of Toronto group, including Bill Buxton, developed a multi-touch tablet that used capacitance rather than bulky camera-based optical sensing systems (see History of multi-touch).

1985 USED FOR POINT OF SALE - The first commercially available graphical point-of-sale (POS) software was demonstrated on the 16-bit Atari 520ST color computer. It featured a color touchscreen widget-driven interface. The ViewTouch POS software was first shown by its developer, Gene Mosher, at the Atari Computer demonstration area of the Fall COMDEX expo in 1986.

1987 CAPACITANCE TOUCH KEYS - Casio launched the Casio PB-1000 pocket computer with a touchscreen consisting of a 4×4 matrix, resulting in 16 touch areas in its small LCD graphic screen.

1988 SELECT ON &quot;LIFT-OFF&quot; - Touchscreens had a bad reputation of being imprecise until 1988. Most user-interface books would state that touchscreen selections were limited to targets larger than the average finger. At the time, selections were done in such a way that a target was selected as soon as the finger came over it, and the corresponding action was performed immediately. Errors were common, due to parallax or calibration problems, leading to user frustration. &quot;Lift-off strategy&quot; was introduced by researchers at the University of Maryland Human–Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL). As users touch the screen, feedback is provided as to what will be selected: users can adjust the position of the finger, and the action takes place only when the finger is lifted off the screen. This allowed the selection of small targets, down to a single pixel on a 640×480 Video Graphics Array (VGA) screen (a standard of that time).

1988 WORLD EXPO - From April to October 1988, the city of Brisbane, Australia hosted Expo 88, whose theme was “leisure in the age of technology”. To support the event and provide information to expo visitors, Telecom Australia (now Telstra) erected 8 kiosks around the expo site with a total of 56 touch screen information consoles, being specially modified Sony Videotex Workstations. Each system was also equipped with a videodisc player, speakers, and a 20 MB hard drive. In order to keep up-to-date information during the event, the database of visitor information was updated and remotely transferred to the computer terminals each night. Using the touch screens, visitors were able to find information about the exposition’s rides, attractions, performances, facilities, and the surrounding areas. Visitors could also select between information displayed in English and Japanese; a reflection of Australia’s overseas tourist market in the 1980s. It is worth noting that Telecom’s Expo Info system was based on an earlier system employed at Expo 86 in Vancouver, Canada.

1990 SINGLE AND MULTI-TOUCH GESTURES - Sears et al. (1990) gave a review of academic research on single and multi-touch human–computer interaction of the time, describing gestures such as rotating knobs, adjusting sliders, and swiping the screen to activate a switch (or a U-shaped gesture for a toggle switch). The HCIL team developed and studied small touchscreen keyboards (including a study that showed users could type at 25 on a touchscreen keyboard), aiding their introduction on mobile devices. They also designed and implemented multi-touch gestures such as selecting a range of a line, connecting objects, and a &quot;tap-click&quot; gesture to select while maintaining location with another finger.

1990 TOUCHSCREEN SLIDER AND TOGGLE SWITCHES - HCIL demonstrated a touchscreen slider, which was later cited as prior art in the lock screen patent litigation between Apple and other touchscreen mobile phone vendors (in relation to ).

1991 INERTIAL CONTROL - From 1991 to 1992, the Sun Star7 prototype PDA implemented a touchscreen with inertial scrolling.

1993 CAPACITANCE MOUSE / KEYPAD - Bob Boie of AT&amp;T Bell Labs, patented a simple mouse or keypad that capacitively sensed just one finger through a thin insulator. Although not claimed or even mentioned in the patent, this technology could potentially have been used as a capacitance touchscreen.

1993 FIRST RESISTIVE TOUCHSCREEN PHONE - IBM released the IBM Simon, which is the first touchscreen phone.

EARLY 90s ABANDONED GAME CONTROLLER - An early attempt at a handheld game console with touchscreen controls was Sega&#x27;s intended successor to the Game Gear, though the device was ultimately shelved and never released due to the expensive cost of touchscreen technology in the early 1990s.

1994 FIRST WIRE BASED PROJECTED CAPACITANCE - Stumpe and Beck&#x27;s touchscreens (1972/1977 - already cited), used opaque conductive copper tracks that obscured about 50% of the screen (80 micron track / 80 micron space). The advent of projected capacitance in 1984, however, with its improved sensing capability, indicated that most of these tracks could be eliminated. This proved to be so, and led to the invention of a wire based touchscreen in 1994, where one 25 micron diameter, insulation coated wire replaced about 30 of these 80 micron wide tracks, and could also accurately sense fingers through thick glass. Screen masking, caused by the copper, was reduced from 50% to less than 0.5%.

The use of fine wire meant that very large touchscreens, several meters wide, could be plotted onto a thin polyester support film with a simple x/y pen plotter, eliminating the need for expensive and complicated sputter coating, laser ablation, screen printing or etching. The resulting, incredibly flexible, touchscreen film, less than 100 microns thick, could be attached by static or non-setting weak adhesive to one side of a sheet of glass, for sensing through that glass. Early versions of this device were controlled by the PIC16C54 microchip.

1994 FIRST PUB GAME WITH TOUCHSCREEN - Appearing in pubs in 1994, JPM&#x27;s Monopoly SWP (skill with prizes) was the first machine to use touch screen technology instead of buttons (see Quiz machine / History). It used a 14 inch version of this newly invented wire based projected capacitance touchscreen and had 64 sensing areas - the wiring pattern being similar to that shown in the lower diagram. The zig-zag pattern was introduced to minimize visual reflections and prevent Moire interference between the wires and the monitor line scans. About 600 of these were sold for this purpose, retailing at £50 apiece, which was very cheap for the time. Working through very thick glass made it ideal for operation in a &quot;hostile&quot; environment, such as a pub. Although reflected light from the copper wires was noticeable under certain lighting conditions, this problem was eliminated by using tinted glass. The reflection issue was later resolved by using finer (10 micron diameter), dark coated wires. Throughout the following decade JPM continued to use touchscreens for many other games such as &quot;Cluedo&quot; and &quot;Who wants to be a Millionaire&quot;.

1998 PROJECTED CAPACITANCE LICENSES - This technology was licensed four years later to Romag Glass Products - later to become Zytronic Displays, and Visual Planet in 2003 (see page 4).

2004 MOBILE MULTI-TOUCH PROJECTED CAPACITANCE PATENT - Apple patents its multi-touch capacitive touchscreen for mobile devices.

2004 VIDEO GAMES WITH TOUCHSCREENS - Touchscreens were not popularly used for video games until the release of the Nintendo DS in 2004.

2007 MOBILE PHONE WITH CAPACITANCE - The first mobile phone with a capacitive touchscreen was LG Prada, released in May 2007 (which was before the first iPhone released). By 2009, touchscreen-enabled mobile phones were becoming trendy and quickly gaining popularity in both basic and advanced devices. In Quarter-4 2009 for the first time, a majority of smartphones (i.e. not all mobile phones) shipped with touchscreens over non-touch.

2013 RESISTIVE VERSUS PROJECTED CAPACITANCE SALES - In 2007, 93% of touchscreens shipped were resistive and only 4% were projected capacitance. In 2013, 3% of touchscreens shipped were resistive and 96% were projected capacitance (see page 5).

2015 FORCE SENSING TOUCHSCREENS - Until recently, most consumer touchscreens could only sense one point of contact at a time, and few have had the capability to sense how hard one is touching. This has changed with the commercialization of multi-touch technology, and the Apple Watch being released with a force-sensitive display in April 2015.


2015 BISTATE PROJECTED CAPACITANCE - When used as a Projected Capacitance touchscreen, in mutual capacitance mode, diagonal wiring requires each I/O line to be capable of switching between two states (bistate), an output some of the time and an input at other times. I/Os are inputs most of the time, but, once every scan, one of the I/Os has to take its turn at being an output, the remaining input I/Os sensing any signals it generates. The I/O lines, therefore, may have to change from input to output, and vice versa, many times a second. 
This new design won an Electronics Weekly Elektra Award in 2017.

2021 FIRST &quot;INFINITELY WIDE&quot; TOUCHSCREEN PATENT - With standard x/y array touchscreens, the length of the horizontal sensing elements increases as the width of the touchscreen increases. Eventually, a limit is hit where the resistance gets so great that the touchscreen can no longer function properly. 

The patent describes how the use of diagonal elements ensures that the length of any element never exceeds 1.414 times the height formula_1 of the touchscreen, no matter how wide it is. This could be reduced to 1.15 times the height, if opposing diagonal elements intersect at 60 degrees instead of 90 degrees. The elongated touchscreen could be controlled by a single processor, or the distant ends could be controlled totally independently by different processors, linked by a synchronizing processor in the overlapping middle section. The number of unique intersections could be increased by allowing individual sensing elements to run in two opposing directions - as shown in the diagram.

==Technologies==

There are a number of touchscreen technologies, with different methods of sensing touch.

===Resistive===

A resistive touchscreen panel is composed of several thin layers, the most important of which are two transparent electrically resistive layers facing each other with a thin gap between them. The top layer (the layer that is touched) has a coating on the underside surface; just beneath it is a similar resistive layer on top of its substrate. One layer has conductive connections along its sides, while the other along the top and bottom. A voltage is applied to one layer and sensed by the other. When an object, such as a fingertip or stylus tip, presses down onto the outer surface, the two layers touch to become connected at that point. The panel then behaves as a pair of voltage dividers, one axis at a time. By rapidly switching between each layer, the position of pressure on the screen can be detected.

Resistive touch is used in restaurants, factories, and hospitals due to its high tolerance for liquids and contaminants. A major benefit of resistive-touch technology is its low cost. Additionally, they may be used with gloves on, or by using anything rigid as a finger substitute, as only sufficient pressure is necessary for the touch to be sensed. Disadvantages include the need to press down, and a risk of damage by sharp objects. Resistive touchscreens also suffer from poorer contrast, due to having additional reflections (i.e. glare) from the layers of material placed over the screen. This type of touchscreen has been used by Nintendo in the DS family, the 3DS family, and the Wii U GamePad.

Due to their simple structure, with very few inputs, resistive touchscreens are mainly used for single touch operation, although some two touch versions (often described as multi-touch) are available. However, there are some true multi-touch resistive touchscreens available. These need many more inputs, and rely on x/y multiplexing to keep the I/O count down.

One example of a true multi-touch resistive touchscreen can detect 10 fingers at the same time. This has 80 I/O connections. These are possibly split 34 x inputs / 46 y outputs, forming a standard 3:4 aspect ratio touchscreen with 1564 x/y intersecting touch sensing nodes.

Tri-state multiplexing could have been used instead of x/y multiplexing. This would have reduced the I/O count from 80 to 60 while creating 1770 unique touch sensing nodes, with no need for a bezel, and with all inputs coming from just one edge.

===Surface acoustic wave===
Surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology uses ultrasonic waves that pass over the touchscreen panel. When the panel is touched, a portion of the wave is absorbed. The change in ultrasonic waves is processed by the controller to determine the position of the touch event. Surface acoustic wave touchscreen panels can be damaged by outside elements. Contaminants on the surface can also interfere with the functionality of the touchscreen.

SAW devices have a wide range of applications, including delay lines, filters, correlators and DC to DC converters.

===Capacitive touchscreen===


A capacitive touchscreen panel consists of an insulator, such as glass, coated with a transparent conductor, such as indium tin oxide (ITO). As the human body is also an electrical conductor, touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen&#x27;s electrostatic field, measurable as a change in capacitance. Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is then sent to the controller for processing. Some touchscreens use silver instead of ITO, as ITO causes several environmental problems due to the use of indium. The controller is typically a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip, which in turn usually sends the signals to a CMOS digital signal processor (DSP) for processing.

Unlike a resistive touchscreen, some capacitive touchscreens cannot be used to detect a finger through electrically insulating material, such as gloves. This disadvantage especially affects usability in consumer electronics, such as touch tablet PCs and capacitive smartphones in cold weather when people may be wearing gloves. It can be overcome with a special capacitive stylus, or a special-application glove with an embroidered patch of conductive thread allowing electrical contact with the user&#x27;s fingertip.

A low-quality switching-mode power supply unit with an accordingly unstable, noisy voltage may temporarily interfere with the precision, accuracy and sensitivity of capacitive touch screens.

Some capacitive display manufacturers continue to develop thinner and more accurate touchscreens. Those for mobile devices are now being produced with &#x27;in-cell&#x27; technology, such as in Samsung&#x27;s Super AMOLED screens, that eliminates a layer by building the capacitors inside the display itself. This type of touchscreen reduces the visible distance between the user&#x27;s finger and what the user is touching on the screen, reducing the thickness and weight of the display, which is desirable in smartphones.

A simple parallel-plate capacitor has two conductors separated by a dielectric layer. Most of the energy in this system is concentrated directly between the plates. Some of the energy spills over into the area outside the plates, and the electric field lines associated with this effect are called fringing fields. Part of the challenge of making a practical capacitive sensor is to design a set of printed circuit traces which direct fringing fields into an active sensing area accessible to a user. A parallel-plate capacitor is not a good choice for such a sensor pattern. Placing a finger near fringing electric fields adds conductive surface area to the capacitive system. The additional charge storage capacity added by the finger is known as finger capacitance, or CF. The capacitance of the sensor without a finger present is known as parasitic capacitance, or CP.

====Surface capacitance====
In this basic technology, only one side of the insulator is coated with a conductive layer. A small voltage is applied to the layer, resulting in a uniform electrostatic field. When a conductor, such as a human finger, touches the uncoated surface, a capacitor is dynamically formed. The sensor&#x27;s controller can determine the location of the touch indirectly from the change in the capacitance as measured from the four corners of the panel. As it has no moving parts, it is moderately durable but has limited resolution, is prone to false signals from parasitic capacitive coupling, and needs calibration during manufacture. It is therefore most often used in simple applications such as industrial controls and kiosks.

Although some standard capacitance detection methods are projective, in the sense that they can be used to detect a finger through a non-conductive surface, they are very sensitive to fluctuations in temperature, which expand or contract the sensing plates, causing fluctuations in the capacitance of these plates. These fluctuations result in a lot of background noise, so a strong finger signal is required for accurate detection. This limits applications to those where the finger directly touches the sensing element or is sensed through a relatively thin non-conductive surface.

====Projected capacitance====
Projected capacitive touch (PCT; also PCAP) technology is a variant of capacitive touch technology but where sensitivity to touch, accuracy, resolution and speed of touch have been greatly improved by the use of a simple form of artificial intelligence. This intelligent processing enables finger sensing to be projected, accurately and reliably, through very thick glass and even double glazing.

Projected capacitance is a method for accurately detecting and tracking a particular variable, or group of variables (such as finger(s)), by: a) using a simple form of artificial intelligence to develop a profile of the capacitance changing effects expected for that variable, b) specifically looking for such changes, and c) eliminating measured capacitance changes that do not match this profile, attributable to global variables (such as temperature/humidity, dirt build-up, electrical noise), and local variables (such as rain drops, partial shade and hands/elbows). Capacitance sensors may be discrete - possibly (but not necessarily) in a regular array, or they may be multiplexed.

Assumptions.

In practice, various assumptions are made, such as: - a) fingers will not be touching the screen at &quot;power-up&quot;, b) a finger will not be on the same spot for more than a fixed period of time, and c) fingers will not be touching everywhere at the same time.

a) If a finger IS touching the screen at &quot;power-up&quot;, then, as soon as it is removed a large &quot;anti-touch&quot; capacitance change will be detected. This signals to the processor to reset the touch thresholds and store new &quot;no touch&quot; values for each input.

b) Long-term drift compensation is used to gradually raise or lower these thresholds (trending eventually to &quot;no-touch&quot;). This compensates for global changes in temperature and humidity. It also eliminates the possibility of any position appearing to be touched for too long, due to some &quot;non-finger&quot; event. This might be caused, for example, by a wet leaf landing on, and sticking to the screen.

c) When a decision is to be made about the validity of one or more touches, then, assumption c) means that the average value, of changes measured for some of the inputs with the smallest change, can be used to &quot;offset&quot; the touch thresholds of the inputs in contention. This minimizes the influence of hands and arms.

By these and other means, the processor is constantly fine tuning the touch thresholds, and tweaking the touch sensitivity of each input. This enables very small changes, caused only by fingers, to be accurately detected through thick overlays, or several centimeters of air.

When a conductive object, such as a finger, comes into contact with a PCT panel, it distorts the local electrostatic field at that point. This is measurable as a change in capacitance. If a finger bridges the gap between two of the &quot;tracks&quot;, the charge field is further interrupted and detected by the controller. The capacitance can be changed and measured at every individual point on the grid. This system is able to accurately track touches.

Due to the top layer of a PCT being glass, it is sturdier than less-expensive resistive touch technology.
Unlike traditional capacitive touch technology, it is possible for a PCT system to sense a passive stylus or gloved fingers.

Moisture on the surface of the panel, high humidity, or collected dust are not a problem, especially with &#x27;fine wire&#x27; based touchscreens due to the fact that wire based touchscreens have a very low &#x27;parasitic&#x27; capacitance, and there is a greater distance between neighboring conductors. Projected capacitance has &quot;long term drift compensation&quot; built in. This minimizes the effects of slowly changing environmental factors, such as the build-up of dirt and effects caused by changes in the weather. Drops of rain have little effect, but flowing water, and especially flowing sea water (due to its electrical conductivity), can cause short term issues.

A high frequency (RF) signal, possibly from 100 kHz to 1 MHz, is imposed on one track at a time, and appropriate capacitance measurements are taken ( as described later in this article). This process is repeated until all the tracks have been sampled.

Conductive tracks are often transparent, one example being Indium tin oxide (ITO), a transparent electrical conductor, but these conductive tracks can be made of very fine, non-transparent metal mesh or individual fine wires.

====Projected capacitance touchscreen layout.====


Layout can vary depending on whether a single finger is to be detected or multiple fingers.

In order to detect many fingers at the same time, some modern PCT touch screens are composed of thousands of discrete keys, each key being linked individually to the edge of the touch screen. This is enabled by etching an electrode grid pattern in a transparent conductive coating on one side of a sheet of glass or plastic.
To reduce the number of input tracks, most PCT touch screens use multiplexing. This enables, for example, 100 (n) discrete key inputs to be reduced to 20 formula_2 when using x/y multiplexing, or 15 formula_3 if using bistate multiplexing or tri-state multiplexing.

Capacitance multiplexing requires a grid of intersecting, but electrically isolated conductive tracks. This can be achieved in many different ways. One way is by creating parallel conductive tracks on one side of a plastic film, and similar parallel tracks on the other side, orientated at 90 degrees to the first side.

Another way is to etch tracks on separate sheets of glass, and join these sheets, with tracks at right angles to each other, face to face using a thin non-conductive, adhesive interlayer.
A simple alternative is to embed an x/y or diagonal grid of very fine, insulation coated conductive wires in a thin polyester film. This film can then be attached to one side of a sheet of glass, for operation through the glass.

Touch resolution and the number of fingers that can be detected simultaneously is determined by the number of cross-over points (x * y). If x + y = n, then the maximum possible number of cross-overs is (n/2)2.

==== Mutual capacitance ====
An electrical signal, imposed on one electrical conductor, can be capacitively &quot;sensed&quot; by another electrical conductor that is in very close proximity, but electrically isolated—a feature that is exploited in mutual capacitance touchscreens. In a mutual capacitive sensor array, the &quot;mutual&quot; crossing of one electrical conductor with another electrical conductor, but with no direct electrical contact, forms a capacitor (see touchscreen#Construction).

High frequency voltage pulses are applied to these conductors, one at a time. These pulses capacitively couple to every conductor that intersects it.

Bringing a finger or conductive stylus close to the surface of the sensor changes the local electrostatic field, which in turn reduces the capacitance between these intersecting conductors. Any significant change in the strength of the signal sensed is used to determine if a finger is present or not at an intersection.

The capacitance change at every intersection on the grid can be measured to accurately determine one or more touch locations.
Mutual capacitance allows multi-touch operation where multiple fingers, palms or styli can be accurately tracked at the same time.The greater the number of intersections, the better the touch resolution and the more independent fingers that can be detected.
 This indicates a distinct advantage of diagonal wiring over standard x/y wiring, since diagonal wiring creates nearly twice the number of intersections.

A 30 i/o, 16×14 x/y array, for example, would have 224 of these intersections / capacitors, and a 30 i/o diagonal lattice array could have 435 intersections.

Each trace of an x/y mutual capacitance array only has one function, it is either an input or an output. The horizontal traces may be transmitters while the vertical traces are sensors, or vice versa.

The traces in a diagonal mutual capacitance array, however, have to continuously change their functionality, &quot;on the fly&quot;, by a process called bi-state multiplexing or Tri-state multiplexing. Some of the time a trace will be an output, at another time it will be an input or &quot;grounded&quot;. A &quot;look-up&quot; table can be used to simplify this process. By slightly distorting the conductors in a &quot;n&quot; I/O diagonal matrix, the equivalent of a (n-1) by (n/2) array is formed. After address decoding, this can then be processed as a standard x/y array.

==== Self-capacitance ====
Self-capacitance sensors can have the same X/Y or diagonal grid layout as mutual capacitance sensors, but, with self-capacitance all the traces usually operate independently, with no interaction between different traces. Along with several other methods, the extra capacitive load of a finger on a trace electrode may be measured by a current meter, or by the change in frequency of an RC oscillator.

Traces are sensed, one after the other until all the traces have been sensed. A finger may be detected anywhere along the whole length of a trace (even &quot;off-screen&quot;), but there is no indication where the finger is along that trace. If, however, a finger is also detected along another intersecting trace, then it is assumed that the finger position is at the intersection of the two traces. This allows for the speedy and accurate detection of a single finger.

There is, however, ambiguity if more than one finger is to be detected. Two fingers may have four possible detection positions, only two of which are true, the other two being &quot;ghosts.&quot; However, by selectively de-sensitizing any touch-points in contention, conflicting results are easily resolved. This enables self-capacitance to be used for two touch operation.

Although mutual capacitance is simpler for multi-touch, multi-touch can be achieved using self-capacitance.

If the trace being sensed is intersected by another trace that has a &quot;desensitizing&quot; signal on it, then that intersection is insensitive to touch. By imposing such a &quot;desensitizing&quot; signal on all the intersecting traces, except one, along the trace being sensed, then just a short length of that trace will be sensitive to touch. By selecting a sequence of these sensing sections along the trace, it is possible to determine the accurate position of multiple fingers along the one trace. This process can then be repeated for all the other traces until the whole screen has been scanned.

Self-capacitive touch screen layers are used on mobile phones such as the Sony Xperia Sola, the Samsung Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S5, and Galaxy Alpha.

Self-capacitance is far more sensitive than mutual capacitance and is mainly used for single touch, simple gesturing and proximity sensing where the finger does not even have to touch the glass surface. Mutual capacitance is mainly used for multitouch applications. Many touchscreen manufacturers use both self and mutual capacitance technologies in the same product, thereby combining their individual benefits.

====Self-capacitance vs. mutual capacitance====

When using a 16 x 14 X/Y array to determine the position of a single finger by self-capacitance, 30 (i.e. 16 + 14) capacitance measurements are required. The finger being determined to be at the intersection of the strongest of the 16 x measurements and the strongest of the 14 y measurements. However, when using mutual capacitance, every intersection may have to be measured, making a total of 224 (i.e. 16 x 14) capacitance measurements. In this example, therefore, mutual capacitance requires nearly 7 times as many measurements as self-capacitance to detect the position of a finger.
Many applications, such as selecting items from a list or menu, require just one finger, and self-capacitance is eminently suitable for such applications, due to the relatively low processing load, simpler processing method, the ability to sense through thick dielectric materials or air, and the possibility of reducing the number of inputs required, through repeat track layouts.
For many other applications, however, such as for expanding / contracting items on the screen and for other gestures, two or more fingers need to be tracked.

Two fingers can be detected and tracked accurately using self-capacitance, but this does involve a few extra calculations, and 4 extra capacitance measurements to eliminate the 2 &quot;ghost&quot; positions. One method is to undertake a full self-capacitance scan, to detect the 4 ambiguous finger positions, then use just 4 targeted mutual capacitance measurements to discover which two of the 4 positions are valid and which 2 are not. This gives a total of 34 measurements—still far less than the 224 required when using mutual capacitance alone.

With 3 fingers, 9 disambiguations are required; with 4 fingers, 16 disambiguations etc.

With more fingers, it may be decided that the process of disambiguation is too unwieldy. If sufficient processing power is available, the switch can then be made to full mutual capacitance scanning.

====Use of stylus on capacitive screens====
Capacitive touchscreens do not necessarily need to be operated by a finger, but until recently the special styli required could be quite expensive to purchase. The cost of this technology has fallen greatly in recent years and capacitive styli are now widely available for a nominal charge, and often given away free with mobile accessories. These consist of an electrically conductive shaft with a soft conductive rubber tip, thereby resistively connecting the fingers to the tip of the stylus.

===Infrared grid===
An infrared touchscreen uses an array of X-Y infrared LED and photodetector pairs around the edges of the screen to detect a disruption in the pattern of LED beams. These LED beams cross each other in vertical and horizontal patterns. This helps the sensors pick up the exact location of the touch. A major benefit of such a system is that it can detect essentially any opaque object including a finger, gloved finger, stylus or pen. It is generally used in outdoor applications and POS systems that cannot rely on a conductor (such as a bare finger) to activate the touchscreen. Unlike capacitive touchscreens, infrared touchscreens do not require any patterning on the glass which increases durability and optical clarity of the overall system. Infrared touchscreens are sensitive to dirt and dust that can interfere with the infrared beams, and suffer from parallax in curved surfaces and accidental press when the user hovers a finger over the screen while searching for the item to be selected.

===Infrared acrylic projection===
A translucent acrylic sheet is used as a rear-projection screen to display information. The edges of the acrylic sheet are illuminated by infrared LEDs, and infrared cameras are focused on the back of the sheet. Objects placed on the sheet are detectable by the cameras. When the sheet is touched by the user, frustrated total internal reflection results in leakage of infrared light which peaks at the points of maximum pressure, indicating the user&#x27;s touch location. Microsoft&#x27;s PixelSense tablets use this technology.

===Optical imaging===
Optical touchscreens are a relatively modern development in touchscreen technology, in which two or more image sensors (such as CMOS sensors) are placed around the edges (mostly the corners) of the screen. Infrared backlights are placed in the sensor&#x27;s field of view on the opposite side of the screen. A touch blocks some lights from the sensors, and the location and size of the touching object can be calculated (see visual hull). This technology is growing in popularity due to its scalability, versatility, and affordability for larger touchscreens.

===Dispersive signal technology===
Introduced in 2002 by 3M, this system detects a touch by using sensors to measure the piezoelectricity in the glass. Complex algorithms interpret this information and provide the actual location of the touch. The technology is unaffected by dust and other outside elements, including scratches. Since there is no need for additional elements on screen, it also claims to provide excellent optical clarity. Any object can be used to generate touch events, including gloved fingers. A downside is that after the initial touch, the system cannot detect a motionless finger. However, for the same reason, resting objects do not disrupt touch recognition.

===Acoustic pulse recognition===
The key to this technology is that a touch at any one position on the surface generates a sound wave in the substrate which then produces a unique combined signal as measured by three or more tiny transducers attached to the edges of the touchscreen. The digitized signal is compared to a list corresponding to every position on the surface, determining the touch location. A moving touch is tracked by rapid repetition of this process. Extraneous and ambient sounds are ignored since they do not match any stored sound profile. The technology differs from other sound-based technologies by using a simple look-up method rather than expensive signal-processing hardware. As with the dispersive signal technology system, a motionless finger cannot be detected after the initial touch. However, for the same reason, the touch recognition is not disrupted by any resting objects. The technology was created by SoundTouch Ltd in the early 2000s, as described by the patent family EP1852772, and introduced to the market by Tyco International&#x27;s Elo division in 2006 as Acoustic Pulse Recognition. The touchscreen used by Elo is made of ordinary glass, giving good durability and optical clarity. The technology usually retains accuracy with scratches and dust on the screen. The technology is also well suited to displays that are physically larger.

==Construction==
There are several principal ways to build a touchscreen. The key goals are to recognize one or more fingers touching a display, to interpret the command that this represents, and to communicate the command to the appropriate application.

Multi-touch projected capacitance screens


A very simple, low cost way to make a multi-touch projected capacitance touchscreen, is to sandwich an x/y or diagonal matrix of fine, insulation coated copper or tungsten wires between two layers of clear polyester film. This creates an array of proximity sensing micro-capacitors. One of these micro-capacitors every 10 to 15 mm is probably sufficient spacing if fingers are relatively widely spaced apart, but very high discrimination multi-touch may need a micro-capacitor every 5 or 6 mm. A similar system can be used for ultra-high resolution sensing, such as fingerprint sensing. Fingerprint sensors require a micro-capacitor spacing of about 44 to 50 microns.

The touchscreens can be manufactured at home, using readily available tools and materials, or it can be done industrially.

First, a &quot;continuous-trace&quot; wiring pattern is generated using a simple CAD system.

The wire is threaded through a plotter pen and plotted directly, as one continuous wire, onto a thin sheet of adhesive coated, clear polyester film (such as &quot;window film&quot;), using a standard, low cost x/y pen plotter. After plotting, the single wire is gently cut into individual sections with a sharp scalpel, taking care not to damage the film.

A second identical polyester film is laminated over the first film. The resulting touchscreen film is then trimmed to shape, and a connector is retro-fitted.

The end product is extremely flexible, being about 75 microns thick (about the thickness of a human hair). It can even be creased without loss of functionality.

The film can be mounted on, or behind non-conducting (or slightly conducting) surfaces. Usually, it is mounted behind a sheet of glass up to 12 mm thick (or more), for sensing through the glass.

This method is suitable for a wide range of touchscreen sizes from very small to several meters wide - or even wider, if using a diagonally wired matrix.

The end product is environmentally friendly as it uses recyclable polyester, and minute quantities of copper wire. The film could even have a second life as another product, such as drawing film, or wrapping film. Unlike some other touchscreen technologies, no complex processes or rare materials are used.

For non-touchscreen applications, other plastics (e.g. vinyl or ABS) may be used. The film can be blow molded or heat formed into complex three dimensional shapes, such as bottles, globes or car dashboards. Alternatively, the wires can be embedded in thick plastic such as fiber glass or carbon fiber body panels.

Single touch resistive touchscreens

In the resistive approach, which used to be the most popular technique, there are typically four layers:

* Top polyester-coated layer with a transparent metallic-conductive coating on the bottom.
* Adhesive spacer
* Glass layer coated with a transparent metallic-conductive coating on the top
* Adhesive layer on the backside of the glass for mounting.

When a user touches the surface, the system records the change in the electric current that flows through the display.

Dispersive signal

Dispersive signal technology measures the piezoelectric effect—the voltage generated when mechanical force is applied to a material that occurs chemically when a strengthened glass substrate is touched.

Infrared

There are two infrared-based approaches. In one, an array of sensors detects a finger touching or almost touching the display, thereby interrupting infrared light beams projected over the screen. In the other, bottom-mounted infrared cameras record heat from screen touches.

In each case, the system determines the intended command based on the controls showing on the screen at the time and the location of the touch.

==Development==
The development of multi-touch screens facilitated the tracking of more than one finger on the screen; thus, operations that require more than one finger are possible. These devices also allow multiple users to interact with the touchscreen simultaneously.

With the growing use of touchscreens, the cost of touchscreen technology is routinely absorbed into the products that incorporate it and is nearly eliminated. Touchscreen technology has demonstrated reliability and is found in airplanes, automobiles, gaming consoles, machine control systems, appliances, and handheld display devices including cellphones; the touchscreen market for mobile devices was projected to produce US$5 billion by 2009.

The ability to accurately point on the screen itself is also advancing with the emerging graphics tablet-screen hybrids. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) plays a major role in this innovation due its high piezoelectric properties, which allow the tablet to sense pressure, making such things as digital painting behave more like paper and pencil.

TapSense, announced in October 2011, allows touchscreens to distinguish what part of the hand was used for input, such as the fingertip, knuckle and fingernail. This could be used in a variety of ways, for example, to copy and paste, to capitalize letters, to activate different drawing modes, etc.

==Ergonomics and usage==

===Touchscreen enable===
For touchscreens to be effective input devices, users must be able to accurately select targets and avoid accidental selection of adjacent targets. The design of touchscreen interfaces should reflect technical capabilities of the system, ergonomics, cognitive psychology and human physiology.

Guidelines for touchscreen designs were first developed in the 2000s, based on early research and actual use of older systems, typically using infrared grids—which were highly dependent on the size of the user&#x27;s fingers. These guidelines are less relevant for the bulk of modern touch devices which use capacitive or resistive touch technology.

From the mid-2000s, makers of operating systems for smartphones have promulgated standards, but these vary between manufacturers, and allow for significant variation in size based on technology changes, so are unsuitable from a human factors perspective.

Much more important is the accuracy humans have in selecting targets with their finger or a pen stylus. The accuracy of user selection varies by position on the screen: users are most accurate at the center, less so at the left and right edges, and least accurate at the top edge and especially the bottom edge. The R95 accuracy (required radius for 95% target accuracy) varies from in the center to in the lower corners. Users are subconsciously aware of this, and take more time to select targets which are smaller or at the edges or corners of the touchscreen.

This user inaccuracy is a result of parallax, visual acuity and the speed of the feedback loop between the eyes and fingers. The precision of the human finger alone is much, much higher than this, so when assistive technologies are provided—such as on-screen magnifiers—users can move their finger (once in contact with the screen) with precision as small as 0.1 mm (0.004 in).

===Hand position, digit used and switching===
Users of handheld and portable touchscreen devices hold them in a variety of ways, and routinely change their method of holding and selection to suit the position and type of input. There are four basic types of handheld interaction:
* Holding at least in part with both hands, tapping with a single thumb
* Holding with two hands and tapping with both thumbs
* Holding with one hand, tapping with the finger (or rarely, thumb) of another hand
* Holding the device in one hand, and tapping with the thumb from that same hand

Use rates vary widely. While two-thumb tapping is encountered rarely (1–3%) for many general interactions, it is used for 41% of typing interaction.

In addition, devices are often placed on surfaces (desks or tables) and tablets especially are used in stands. The user may point, select or gesture in these cases with their finger or thumb, and vary use of these methods.

===Combined with haptics===
Touchscreens are often used with haptic response systems. A common example of this technology is the vibratory feedback provided when a button on the touchscreen is tapped. Haptics are used to improve the user&#x27;s experience with touchscreens by providing simulated tactile feedback, and can be designed to react immediately, partly countering on-screen response latency. Research from the University of Glasgow (Brewster, Chohan, and Brown, 2007; and more recently Hogan) demonstrates that touchscreen users reduce input errors (by 20%), increase input speed (by 20%), and lower their cognitive load (by 40%) when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback. On top of this, a study conducted in 2013 by Boston College explored the effects that touchscreens haptic stimulation had on triggering psychological ownership of a product. Their research concluded that a touchscreens ability to incorporate high amounts of haptic involvement resulted in customers feeling more endowment to the products they were designing or buying. The study also reported that consumers using a touchscreen were willing to accept a higher price point for the items they were purchasing.

===Customer service===
Touchscreen technology has become integrated into many aspects of customer service industry in the 21st century. The restaurant industry is a good example of touchscreen implementation into this domain. Chain restaurants such as Taco Bell, Panera Bread, and McDonald&#x27;s offer touchscreens as an option when customers are ordering items off the menu. While the addition of touchscreens is a development for this industry, customers may choose to bypass the touchscreen and order from a traditional cashier. To take this a step further, a restaurant in Bangalore has attempted to completely automate the ordering process. Customers sit down to a table embedded with touchscreens and order off an extensive menu. Once the order is placed it is sent electronically to the kitchen. These types of touchscreens fit under the Point of Sale (POS) systems mentioned in the lead section.

===&quot;Gorilla arm&quot;===

Extended use of gestural interfaces without the ability of the user to rest their arm is referred to as &quot;gorilla arm&quot;. It can result in fatigue, and even repetitive stress injury when routinely used in a work setting. Certain early pen-based interfaces required the operator to work in this position for much of the workday. Allowing the user to rest their hand or arm on the input device or a frame around it is a solution for this in many contexts. This phenomenon is often cited as an example of movements to be minimized by proper ergonomic design.

Unsupported touchscreens are still fairly common in applications such as ATMs and data kiosks, but are not an issue as the typical user only engages for brief and widely spaced periods.

===Fingerprints===
Touchscreens can suffer from the problem of fingerprints on the display. This can be mitigated by the use of materials with optical coatings designed to reduce the visible effects of fingerprint oils. Most modern smartphones have oleophobic coatings, which lessen the amount of oil residue. Another option is to install a matte-finish anti-glare screen protector, which creates a slightly roughened surface that does not easily retain smudges.

===Glove touch===
Capacitive touchscreens rarely work when the user wears gloves. The thickness of the glove and the material they are made of play a significant role on that and the ability of a touchscreen to pick up a touch.

Some devices have a mode which increases the sensitivity of the touchscreen. This allows the touchscreen to be used more reliably with gloves, but can also result in unreliable and phantom inputs. However, thin gloves such as medical gloves are thin enough for users to wear when using touchscreens; mostly applicable to medical technology and machines.

<doc id="667214" wikidata="Q11645907" url="?curid=667214" title="List of Major League Baseball retired numbers">
<text>Major League Baseball (MLB) and its participating clubs have retired various uniform numbers over the course of time, ensuring that those numbers are never worn again and thus will always be associated with particular players or managers of note. The use of numbers on uniforms to better identify one player from another, and hence to boost sales of scorecards, was tried briefly by the Cleveland Indians of 1916, but this failed. The first team to permanently adopt the practice was the New York Yankees of 1929. By 1932, all 16 major league clubs were issuing numbers, and by 1937, the leagues passed rules requiring it.

The Yankees&#x27; original approach was to simply assign the numbers 1 through 8 to the regular starting lineup in their normal batting order. Hence, Babe Ruth wore number 3 and Lou Gehrig number 4. The first major leaguer whose number was retired was Gehrig, in July 1939, following his retirement due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which became popularly known in the United States as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease.

Since then, over 150 other people have had their numbers retired, some with more than one team. This includes managers and coaches, as MLB is the only one of the major North American professional leagues in which the coaching staff wear the same uniforms as players. Three numbers have been retired in honor of people not directly involved on the playing field – all three for team executives. Some of the game&#x27;s early stars, such as Ty Cobb and Christy Mathewson, retired before numbers came into usage. Teams often celebrate their retired numbers and other honored people by hanging banners with the numbers and names. Early stars, as well as honored non-players, will often have numberless banners hanging along with the retired numbers. Because fewer and fewer players stay with one team long enough to warrant their number being retired, some players believe that getting their number retired is a greater honor than going into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Ron Santo, upon his number 10 being retired by the Chicago Cubs on the last day of the 2003 regular season, enthusiastically told the Wrigley Field crowd as his #10 flag was hoisted, &quot;This is &quot;my&quot; Hall of Fame!&quot; However, Santo would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in July 2012, nearly two years after his death, after being voted in by the Veterans Committee.

==List of all-time retired numbers==


==List of pending number retirements==
==Former retired numbers==
It is very rare for a team to reissue a retired number, and usually requires a special circumstance, such as the person for whom the number was retired returning to the team in a player, coach or manager role. Harold Baines provides one example of this when he returned to the White Sox multiple times. The White Sox also re-issued Luis Aparicio&#x27;s number 11, with his permission, to fellow countryman Omar Vizquel in 2010–11.

In cases of franchise relocation, the handling of existing retired numbers is at the discretion of team management. The team may decide to continue honoring the retired numbers (as did the San Francisco Giants), or it may choose to make a &quot;fresh start&quot; and reissue the numbers (as the Washington Nationals have done).

The Cincinnati Reds returned Willard Hershberger&#x27;s number 5 to circulation two years after his death. Cincinnati later re-retired the number to honor Johnny Bench.

When the Florida Marlins moved to their current stadium, LoanDepot Park, and were rebranded as the Miami Marlins, the number 5, which had been retired for the team&#x27;s late first president Carl Barger, was returned to circulation because player Logan Morrison requested permission to wear the number to honor his father.


==Retired in honor of multiple players==
The following numbers have been retired in honor of multiple players:
* Chicago Cubs, #31: retired in 2009 for Fergie Jenkins and Greg Maddux
* Cincinnati Reds, #5: retired in 1940 for Willard Hershberger who had died by suicide during the season; returned to service in 1942; retired in 1984 for Johnny Bench
* Montreal Expos, #10: retired for Rusty Staub in 1993; ceremony to honor #10 for Andre Dawson was held in 1997
* New York Yankees, #8: retired in 1972 for Bill Dickey and Yogi Berra
* St. Louis Cardinals, #42: retired in 1997 by all teams in MLB for Jackie Robinson; ceremony to honor #42 for Bruce Sutter was held in 2006
* New York Yankees, #42: retired in 1997 by all teams in MLB for Jackie Robinson (players already wearing the number could continue to do so by special arrangement); ceremony to honor #42 for Mariano Rivera was held in 2013
* Oakland Athletics, #34: retired for Rollie Fingers in 1993; ceremony to honor #34 for Dave Stewart was held in 2022.

==Retired by multiple teams==
A handful of players who had notable careers for multiple teams have had their numbers retired by each team.
* Frank Robinson&#x27;s #20 was retired by the Reds, Orioles and the then-Indians.
* Rod Carew&#x27;s #29 was retired by the Twins and Angels.
* Hank Aaron&#x27;s #44 was retired by the Braves and Brewers.
* Reggie Jackson had his #9 retired by the Athletics, and his #44 retired by the Yankees.
* Rollie Fingers&#x27; #34 was retired by the Athletics and Brewers.
* Carlton Fisk had his #27 retired by the Red Sox, and his #72 retired by the White Sox.
* Greg Maddux&#x27;s #31 was retired by the Cubs and Braves.
* Nolan Ryan had his #30 retired by the Angels, while his #34 is retired by the Astros and Rangers.
* Wade Boggs&#x27;s #12 was retired by the then-Devil Rays, and his #26 is retired by the Red Sox.
* Roy Halladay&#x27;s #32 was retired by the Blue Jays, and his #34 is retired by the Phillies.
* Jackie Robinson’s #42 has been retired by every team in MLB, due to him breaking the color barrier in baseball.
* Gil Hodges&#x27; #14 was retired by the Mets and Dodgers.
* Willie Mays&#x27; #24 was retired by the Giants and Mets.

Excluding Jackie Robinson, only Frank Robinson and Nolan Ryan have had their number(s) retired by three teams. Managers Casey Stengel and Sparky Anderson have also had numbers retired by two teams. Stengel&#x27;s #37 was retired by the Yankees and Mets. Anderson&#x27;s #10 was retired by the Reds, and his #11 was retired by the Tigers.

== Alternative methods of recognition ==

A number of teams have formal or informal policies of only retiring numbers of players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, although there is no league-wide uniformity and teams sometimes break their own guidelines. As an alternative to retiring numbers, many teams have established other means of honoring former players, such as team-specific Halls of Fame (Angels, Astros, Athletics, Braves, Brewers, Cardinals, Guardians, Mariners, Mets, Orioles, Padres, Rangers, Reds, Red Sox, and Twins) or Walls of Fame (Giants and Phillies), a Ring of Honor (Nationals) or Level of Excellence (Blue Jays). In addition, several teams have kept certain numbers out of circulation since a player left, but have not formally retired them. The Rangers introduced a third means of honoring former players while preparing to open their current home of Globe Life Field in 2020. In December 2019, a few months before the park&#x27;s opening, the team announced that all of its retired numbers would be incorporated into the park&#x27;s posted dimensions.

The Montreal Expos franchise retired jerseys in honor of four players, but returned the numbers to use upon moving to Washington, D.C., to begin play as the Washington Nationals in 2005, becoming the only MLB team with no retired numbers other than Jackie Robinson&#x27;s No. 42. In 2010, the Nationals established a &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; which as of 2022 includes three of those Expos players (Gary Carter, Andre Dawson, and Tim Raines), along with the Expos&#x27; last and Nationals&#x27; first manager, Frank Robinson; Nationals players Iván Rodríguez, Jayson Werth, and Ryan Zimmerman; original Washington Senators (1901–1960) players Joe Cronin, Rick Ferrell, Goose Goslin, Bucky Harris, Walter Johnson, Heinie Manush, Sam Rice, Harmon Killebrew, and Early Wynn, as well as owner Clark Griffith; expansion Washington Senators (1961–1971) player Frank Howard; and Homestead Grays players Cool Papa Bell, Ray Brown, Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Cumberland Posey, and Jud Wilson. The Nationals retired their first number, Ryan Zimmerman&#x27;s No. 11, on June 18, 2022.

The Miami Marlins had previously retired #5 in honor of their first team president, the late Carl Barger, but returned it to use entering the 2012 season when they relocated to the venue now known as LoanDepot Park. As of 2024, they are the only franchise with no retired numbers (aside from Jackie Robinson&#x27;s).

In August 2024, the Minnesota Twins retired the letter W as a tribute to their origin as the Washington Senators during the 100-year anniversary of the Senators&#x27; World Series-winning team.

=== Numbers kept out of circulation ===
Some teams have not formally retired certain numbers, but nonetheless kept them out of circulation. For example, the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; current policy is only to retire the numbers of longtime club members if they are inducted into the Hall of Fame; the lone exception was longtime Dodger player and coach Jim Gilliam, whose #19 was retired when he died of a cerebral hemorrhage during the Dodgers&#x27; 1978 postseason run. Nevertheless, the Dodgers informally kept Fernando Valenzuela&#x27;s #34 out of circulation since he last played for the team in 1990. In 2023, the Dodgers announced that his number would be officially retired.

The San Francisco Giants are currently keeping four numbers; Tim Lincecum&#x27;s #55, Buster Posey&#x27;s #28, Madison Bumgarner&#x27;s #40, and former manager Bruce Bochy&#x27;s #15, out of circulation.

The New York Yankees have not issued CC Sabathia&#x27;s #52 since he retired in 2019.

The Cincinnati Reds took Joey Votto&#x27;s #19 out of circulation after his departure from the team in 2023 and official retirement in 2024.

The Miami Marlins have not issued José Fernández’s #16 since his death in September 2016.

The Milwaukee Brewers have not issued Jim Gantner’s #17 or Ryan Braun&#x27;s #8 since their retirements.

The Toronto Blue Jays have not issued Jose Bautista&#x27;s #19 since his departure from the team in 2017, except in 2019 when Alen Hanson briefly wore the number.

The Chicago Cubs have not issued Anthony Rizzo&#x27;s #44 since his trade from the team in 2021.

The Kansas City Royals have not issued Alex Gordon&#x27;s #4 since his retirement in 2020.

The Colorado Rockies have not issued Nolan Arenado&#x27;s #28 since his trade from the team in 2021.

The Seattle Mariners have kept Jay Buhner&#x27;s #19 out of circulation since his retirement in 2001, as well as #51 for both Randy Johnson and Ichiro Suzuki.

The Arizona Diamondbacks have not issued Paul Goldschmidt&#x27;s #44 since his trade from the team in 2018.

The Chicago White Sox have not issued hitting coach Charley Lau&#x27;s #6 since his death in 1984, except to Lau disciple Walt Hriniak, who was the White Sox hitting coach from 1989-1995. The White Sox have also not issued Ozzie Guillén&#x27;s #13 since leaving as the team&#x27;s manager in 2011.

On Opening Day of the 2012 season, the New York Mets unveiled a memorial &quot;Kid 8&quot; logo to honor the late Gary Carter. Although no Met has worn the number 8 since Carter&#x27;s election to the Hall of Fame, it is not retired. The Mets have also not issued #5 since the retirement of David Wright or #48 since the departure of Jacob deGrom.

The Baltimore Orioles have not re-issued numbers 7, 44, and 46 since the passing of Cal Ripken Sr., Elrod Hendricks, and Mike Flanagan respectively. The team has placed a moratorium on the three numbers in their honors. However, in 2024, Craig Kimbrel became the first Oriole to wear 46 since Flanagan&#x27;s death in 2011, and Jackson Holliday was given permission by the Ripken family to wear #7 ahead of his major league debut in April.

The Boston Red Sox have not re-issued uniform numbers 21 (Roger Clemens), 33 (Jason Varitek) and 49 (Tim Wakefield) since those players left the Red Sox or ended their careers. Varitek later reclaimed #33 upon joining the Red Sox coaching staff.

The St. Louis Cardinals did not reissue Albert Pujols&#x27;s #5 from his first departure after the 2011 season until his return to the team in 2022. Since both his and Yadier Molina&#x27;s retirements at the end of that season, the Cardinals have again kept the number out of circulation. Adam Wainwright&#x27;s #50 was also taken out of circulation after his 2023 retirement.

After Darryl Kile&#x27;s death in 2002, the teams he played for (Colorado Rockies, Houston Astros, and St. Louis Cardinals) took his #57 out of circulation. The Cardinals first re-issued the number in 2021 Spring Training, to pitcher Zack Thompson. Fan favorite Willie McGee has not had his #51 issued since he retired in 1999 except for when Bud Smith wore the number in 2001.

The Philadelphia Phillies are currently keeping three numbers; Chase Utley&#x27;s #26, Jimmy Rollins&#x27; #11, and Ryan Howard&#x27;s #6, out of circulation.

The Colorado Rockies have not re-issued Carlos Gonzalez&#x27;s #5 since he left the team after 2018.

The Tampa Bay Rays have not re-issued Evan Longoria&#x27;s #3 since he left the team after 2017.

The Washington Nationals have not issued Max Scherzer&#x27;s #31 since his trade from the team in 2021, or Stephen Strasburg&#x27;s #37 since his final appearance in 2022 and then official retirement in 2024.

The Detroit Tigers have not re-issued Justin Verlander&#x27;s #35 since his trade to the Astros in 2017. The Tigers also took Miguel Cabrera&#x27;s #24 out of circulation following his 2023 retirement.

The Los Angeles Angels have not re-issued Nick Adenhart&#x27;s #34, after he was killed in a car accident on April 9, 2009, except for Noah Syndergaard, who requested and received the number when he joined the team in 2022. He stated that he wanted to wear his old Mets’ number as a tribute to Adenhart. The Angels have also not re-issued Tim Salmon&#x27;s #15 since his retirement at the end of the 2006 season or Tyler Skaggs #45 since he died on July 1, 2019, although it is not in use anymore. For the remainder of the 2019 season, they put 45 on the mound instead of the sponsor.

== Number retired by Major League Baseball ==

Normally the individual clubs are responsible for retiring numbers. On April 15, 1997, Major League Baseball took the unusual move of retiring a number for all teams. On the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson breaking the baseball color line, his number 42 was retired throughout the majors, at the order of Commissioner Bud Selig. This meant that no future player on any major league team could wear number 42, although players wearing #42 at the time were allowed to continue wearing it (Mariano Rivera was the last active player to be grandfathered in, retiring after the 2013 season).

Starting in the 2007 season, the 60th anniversary of Robinson&#x27;s Major League debut, players and coaches have all worn the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson on Jackie Robinson Day, April 15.

There is a lobby to have uniform #21 retired in all of baseball to honor Roberto Clemente.

==Similar honors==

===Players who pre-date uniform numbers===
Four teams have honored players who played before the advent of uniform numbers by placing their names among those of players whose numbers have been retired:
*Philadelphia Phillies: Grover Cleveland Alexander, Chuck Klein; both are denoted with a stylized &quot;P&quot; at Citizens Bank Park (Klein had various numbers in the later years of his career, but never wore one consistently)
*Detroit Tigers: Ty Cobb, Mickey Cochrane, Sam Crawford, Harry Heilmann, Hughie Jennings, George Kell, Heinie Manush; Cobb&#x27;s name is displayed on the left-field wall of Comerica Park along with the players whose numbers have been retired; the others have their names displayed on the right-field wall (Cochrane actually wore #3 for the Tigers, and Kell wore three different numbers, but the Tigers have not retired these numbers), along with former manager Sparky Anderson. The Tigers eventually retired #3, but that was for Alan Trammell, not Cochrane. 
*San Francisco (New York) Giants: Christy Mathewson and John McGraw; both are denoted with &quot;NY&quot; and their names at Oracle Park
*St. Louis Cardinals: Rogers Hornsby, denoted with an &quot;SL&quot; and his name at Busch Stadium

===Broadcasters===
*Bob Murphy and Ralph Kiner – New York Mets; The radio booth at both Shea Stadium and Citi Field are named for the beloved, late Murphy. The television booth at Citi Field is named for Kiner, who continued to broadcast some home games for the Mets until his death in early 2014. In addition, a special memorial logo honoring Kiner, depicting a microphone along with his name and the years 1922–2014, was displayed at Citi Field on the left field wall adjacent to, but not as a part of, the Mets&#x27; retired numbers, from 2014 to 2016. In the 2016 Mets yearbook, a sidebar in an article on Mike Piazza&#x27;s upcoming number retirement implies that Kiner has been &quot;retired&quot; a la William A. Shea. This was reinforced when the Mets&#x27; retired numbers were moved to the roof facade during the 2016 season to accommodate Mike Piazza&#x27;s #31; Kiner&#x27;s &quot;number&quot; was placed adjacent to the Shea and Jackie Robinson numbers, no longer separated from the others. 
*Jack Buck – St. Louis Cardinals; honored with a drawing of a microphone on the wall with the retired numbers.
*Lon Simmons, Russ Hodges, and Jon Miller – San Francisco Giants; honored with stylized old-style radio microphone displayed in place of a number.
*Marty Brennaman, Waite Hoyt, and Joe Nuxhall – Cincinnati Reds; honored with microphones by the broadcast booth.
*Jerry Coleman – San Diego Padres; a &quot;star on the wall&quot; in reference to his trademark phrase &quot;You can hang a star on that one!&quot; The star is painted in gold on the front of the press box down the right field line, accompanied by Coleman&#x27;s name in white. Upon Coleman&#x27;s death in 2014, the broadcast booth at Petco Park was named in his honor.
*Harry Kalas and Richie Ashburn – Philadelphia Phillies; At Citizens Bank Park, the restaurant built into the base of the main scoreboard is named &quot;Harry the K&#x27;s&quot; in Kalas&#x27;s honor. After Kalas&#x27;s death, the Phillies&#x27; TV-broadcast booth was renamed &quot;The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth&quot;. It is directly next to the radio-broadcast booth, which is named &quot;The Richie &#x27;Whitey&#x27; Ashburn Broadcast Booth&quot;. They both also have statues at Citizens Bank Park (though Ashburn is in uniform for his statue).
*Ernie Harwell – Detroit Tigers; honored with his name alongside the retired players on the Left-Centerfield Brick wall in Comerica Park and a statue &amp; portrait at the stadium&#x27;s front entrance. Honored with the Media Center named after him also.
*Bob Uecker – &quot;50 Years in Baseball&quot; along with Uecker&#x27;s name is next to the Brewers retired numbers at American Family Field.
*Tom Cheek – Toronto Blue Jays; honored with a spot on the Rogers Centre&#x27;s &quot;Level of Excellence&quot; bearing his name and, in place of a jersey number, 4,306 – his streak of consecutive regular-season broadcasts.
*Harry Caray and Jack Brickhouse – Chicago Cubs: Caray is remembered inside and outside of Wrigley Field. A statue of him leading the crowd in &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; is near the bleacher entrance (originally at the corner of Addison Street and Sheffield Avenue), and a caricature of him adorns his former WGN-TV broadcast booth. Brickhouse&#x27;s catch phrase, &quot;Hey hey!&quot; is memorialized in large red letters on each foul pole. (Brickhouse also has a statue on Michigan Avenue.)
*Dave Niehaus – Seattle Mariners; the press box at T-Mobile Park was renamed the &quot;Dave Niehaus Media Center&quot; on April 8, 2011, prior to the Mariners&#x27; home opener against the Cleveland Indians. In addition, a part of First Avenue NW outside the stadium was renamed Dave Niehaus Way, and the wall in deep right-center field also has a microphone with a Dave Niehaus graphic. There is the Dave Niehaus Statue on the Main Concourse at Section 105.
*Vin Scully – Los Angeles Dodgers; in 2001, the Dodgers honored Scully by naming the press box at Dodger Stadium the &quot;Vin Scully Press Box&quot;. However, on January 29, 2016, the Los Angeles City Council in a unanimous vote, renamed Elysian Park Avenue to Vin Scully Avenue, changing the address of Dodger Stadium to 1000 Vin Scully Ave.
*Arch McDonald and Bob Wolff - Washington Senators: MacDonald and Wolff&#x27;s names are on the Washington Nationals&#x27; Ring of Honor at Nationals Park.
*Bill King – Oakland Athletics; The Athletics named their broadcast facilities the &quot;Bill King Broadcast Booth&quot; after King&#x27;s death in 2005.

===Owners and contributors===
*The initials of the late San Diego Padres owner Ray Kroc are painted in gold on the front of the pressbox down the right field line, accompanied by his name in white.
*The initials of the late Boston Red Sox owners Tom and Jean Yawkey are rendered in Morse code and painted in white on the manual scoreboard on Fenway Park&#x27;s Green Monster.
*Charles Bronfman was inducted into the Expos Hall of Fame as its inaugural member in 1993, and a circular patch placed on the right field wall with his name, the number 83, which he used to wear during spring training, and the words &quot;FONDATEUR / FOUNDER&quot;.
*On April 8, 2008, the final opening day at Shea Stadium, the New York Mets unveiled a &quot;Shea&quot; logo which was displayed on the left-field fence next to the team&#x27;s retired numbers. The stadium was named for William Shea, a prominent lawyer who was responsible for the return of National League baseball to New York.
*Walter A. Haas Jr., honorary jersey retired (with stylized Old English &quot;A&quot; in place of a number) in 1995, located in right field. Owner of the Oakland Athletics from 1980 until 1995. Haas purchased the team from Charles O. Finley in 1980, saving the team from potentially moving out of the area.
*At the start of the 2007 season, the Kansas City Royals designated Seat #9 in Section 127, Row C at Kauffman Stadium as the &quot;Buck O&#x27;Neil Legacy Seat&quot; in honor of Negro leagues legend and Royals scout Buck O&#x27;Neil. During each home game, the Royals honor a fan who exemplifies O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s spirit of humanitarianism and community service by inviting that fan to sit in the Buck O&#x27;Neil Legacy Seat.
*Paul Beeston and Pat Gillick, the Toronto Blue Jays&#x27;s former president and general manager, respectively, have been inducted into the team&#x27;s Level of Excellence, alongside the team&#x27;s retired numbers. In addition, a Baseball Hall of Fame banner for Gillick hangs in the Rogers Centre rafters.
*A statue of former Arlington, Texas mayor Tom Vandergriff is located at Vandergriff Plaza at Globe Life Park alongside those of former Texas Rangers Nolan Ryan and Iván Rodríguez, both of whom had their numbers retired. Vandergriff was responsible for bringing Major League Baseball to the Dallas–Fort Worth area.
*The New York Yankees&#x27; spring training facility, George M. Steinbrenner Field is named in honor of late Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
*Walter O&#x27;Malley, honorary jersey retired with the &quot;LA&quot; Dodgers logo in place of number in 2024, in the Ring of Honor at Dodger Stadium. Owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1951 to 1979 who moved the team from Brooklyn to the West Coast.

<text>The chancellor of the University of Mississippi is the chief administrator of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. The position was previously referred to as &quot;president&quot; until chancellor Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard suggested the change in 1858.

Chancellor John Davis Williams, who served during the Ole Miss riot of 1962 and most of the civil rights movement, attempted to remain neutral, stating &quot;My business is to educate the students sent to me.&quot;

<doc id="667227" wikidata="Q3836782" url="?curid=667227" title="Lord Randall">
<text>&quot;Lord Randall&quot;, or &quot;Lord Randal&quot;, () is an Anglo-Scottish border ballad consisting of dialogue between a young Lord and his mother. Similar ballads can be found across Europe in many languages, including Danish, German, Magyar, Irish, Swedish, and Wendish.
 Italian variants are usually titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Poisoned Man&quot;) or &quot;Il testamento dell&#x27;avvelenato&quot; (&quot;The Poisoned Man&#x27;s Will&quot;), the earliest known version being a 1629 setting by Camillo il Bianchino, in Verona. Under the title &quot;Croodlin Doo&quot; Robert Chambers published a version in his &quot;Scottish Ballads&quot; (1829) page 324.

==Summary==
Lord Randall returns home to his mother after visiting his lover. Randall explains that his lover gave him a dinner of eels boiled in broo and that his hunting dogs died after eating the scraps of the meal, leading his mother to realize that he has been poisoned. In some variants, Randall dictates his last will and testament in readiness for his impending death, dividing his possessions among family members and wishing damnation on his lover. Her motive for poisoning him is never discussed.

== Traditional recordings ==
Many traditional versions of the ballad survived long enough to be recorded by folklorists and ethnomusicologists.

Most traditional English versions are called &quot;Henry, My Son&quot;. Dorset traveller Caroline Hughes sang a version to Peter Kennedy in 1968 and another to Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger in the early 1960s which can be heard online on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. Fred Jordan of Ludlow, Shropshire also sang &quot;Henry, My Son&quot; to Mike Yates in 1964 and Gwilym Davies in 1994. Louisa Hooper of Somerset, England (sister of the traditional singer Lucy White) was recorded singing a version entitled &quot;Lord Rendal&quot; by the BBC and Douglas Cleverdon in 1942.

James Madison Carpenter recorded many Scottish versions between 1929 and 1935, which can also be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website. Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing recorded &quot;Lord Rendal&quot;, the Somerset version arranged by Cecil Sharp, on Vocalion A-0167 in the early 1920s. Scottish singer Betsy Miller sang her traditional version with her famous son Ewan MacColl to Alan Lomax in 1953 and on the 1960 album &quot;A Garland Of Scots Folksong&quot;. Scottish traveller Jeannie Robertson had her version entitled &quot;Lord Donald&quot; recorded by Peter Kennedy in 1953 and again by the BBC in 1963, and her nephew Stanley Robertson was later recorded singing the same version, the audio of which is available on the Tobar an Dualchais website.

The Irish traditional singer Elizabeth Cronin was recorded several times singing a version called Lord Rendal. The Irish sean nós singer Joe Heaney sang an Irish language version titled &quot;Amhrán na hEascainne&quot; (&quot;Song of the Eel&quot;).

Several Appalachian musicians recorded the ballad; Jean Ritchie sang the Ritchie family version on the album &quot;Jean Ritchie: Ballads from her Appalachian Family Tradition,&quot; whilst Frank Proffitt was recorded singing another traditional version in 1961. The ballad was also collected extensively throughout the rest of America.

==Cultural uses==
Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; novel &quot;Strong Poison&quot; uses part of the ballad for a title, and has it as epigraph. In 1962, Bob Dylan modeled his song &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s A-Gonna Fall&quot; on &quot;Lord Randall&quot;, introducing each verse with variants of the introductory lines to each verse of &quot;Lord Randall&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s ballad is often interpreted as a reaction to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Dylan himself disclaimed this as an oversimplification, and in reality, Dylan first publicly performed the song a month before the crisis.

<doc id="667231" wikidata="Q314210" url="?curid=667231" title="Tao Yuanming">
<text>Tao Yuanming (365–427), also known as Tao Qian, courtesy name Yuanliang (元亮), was a Chinese poet and politician. He was one of the best-known poets who lived during the Six Dynasties period. Tao Yuanming spent much of his life in reclusion, living in the countryside, farming, reading, drinking wine, receiving the occasional guest, and writing poems in which he reflected on the pleasures and difficulties of life and his decision to withdraw from civil service. Tao&#x27;s simple and direct style was somewhat at odds with the norms for literary writing in his time. In the Tang dynasty, he was well known as a recluse. During the Northern Song dynasty, influential literati figures such as Su Shi declared him a paragon of authenticity and spontaneity in poetry, predicting that he would achieve lasting literary fame. But Tao&#x27;s inclusion in the 6th-century literary anthology &quot;Wen Xuan&quot; implies he began to gain fame in his own era, at least in his birth area. Tao is now regarded as the foremost representative of Fields and Gardens poetry. He found inspiration in the beauty and serenity of the natural world. He is depicted in Jin Guliang&#x27;s &quot;Wu Shuang Pu&quot;.

==Names==
In the middle of his life, Tao changed his name (keeping his family name) from Tao Yuanming () to Tao Qian (). &quot;Master of the Five Willows&quot;, another name he used when quite young, seems to be a sobriquet of his own invention. There is a surviving autobiographical essay from his youth in which Tao uses &quot;Five Willows&quot; to allude to himself. After this, he refers to himself in his earlier writings as &quot;Yuanming&quot;; but it is thought that with the Eastern Jin dynasty&#x27;s demise in 420, he began to call himself &quot;Qian&quot;, meaning &quot;hiding&quot;, to signify his final withdrawal into the quiet life in the country and decision to avoid participation in the political scene. &quot;Tao Qian&quot; could also be translated &quot;Recluse Tao&quot;, but this does not imply an eremitic lifestyle or extreme asceticism but rather a comfortable dwelling with family, friends, neighbors, musical instruments, wine, a nice library, and the beautiful scenery of a mountain farm—Tao Qing&#x27;s compensation for giving up the lifestyle of Tao Yuanming, government servant.

The names Yuanliang (), Shenming (), and Quanming () are all associated with Tao Yuanming. Some of this results from a naming taboo during the Tang dynasty, specifically that the characters for an emperor&#x27;s name were impermissible to use either to write or even to casually pronounce. This taboo required the substitution of similar characters or words. As the &quot;High Founder&quot; of the Tang dynasty (posthumously titled Emperor Gaozu of Tang) had the personal name Li Yuan, the &quot;yuan&quot; () character became taboo. Since this was the same as the &quot;yuan&quot; in Yuanming, various authors substituted the synonymous &quot;shen&quot; () for &quot;yuan&quot;—both referring to &quot;depths&quot;.

==Life==
===Ancestry===
Tao Yuanming&#x27;s great-grandfather was the eminent Jin dynasty general and governor Tao Kan (259–334). His grandfather and father both served as government officials, rising to the level of county governor. But the family circumstances into which Tao Yuanming was born were moderate poverty and lack of much political influence. His father died when he was eight years old.

===Personal background===
Tao Yuanming is considered a person of the Eastern Jin dynasty (316/317 – 419/420 CE) who outlived it. The last stable period in Chinese history had been during the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE), which was followed by the various political permutations known as the Three Kingdoms, one of these successor states being Cao Wei, founded and ruled by the Cao clan and briefly reunifying China. The Jin dynasty was founded and controlled by the Sima clan, the leading members of which were known for gaining and retaining power through corruption. This began before Tao Yuanming&#x27;s birth, when Sima Yan usurped the throne of the Cao Wei dynasty&#x27;s monarchal ruler, establishing its headquarters at the western capital of Chang&#x27;an and renaming the kingdom Jin. The dynasty was characterized by nepotism, corrupt politics, civil disorder, and violence. Various other clans vied for power. The Sima fought these as well as each other. The weaknesses inherent in the system culminated in the War of the Eight Princes (291–306), all eight princes being Simas. Immediate subsequent events resulted in certain rebels and bandits overruning the country. Many of these rebels were not ethnic Han Chinese, and they were generally referred to as the Five Barbarians, or &quot;Wu Hu&quot;, one of which was the Xiongnu empire; this event is thus known as the Uprising of the Five Barbarians. The Xiongnu founded their state of Han-Zhao and overthrew remnants of the Jin north of the Yangzi river, capturing and killing the two last Sima rulers of Western Jin, and in the process capturing the ancient capitals Luoyang and Chang&#x27;an. When the territory north of the Yangzi was captured, a prince in the south, Sima Rui, set up a new Jin dynasty state with a capital at Jiankang. This new Jin empire continued the traditions of violence and corruption of its predecessor, and this manifestation of Jin, known as Eastern Jin, was the one in which Tao Yuanming was born and lived most of his life. Control of Eastern Jin was usurped by a series of successors of various clans, and also subject to less successful rebellions by various warlords, while also facing external threats from other states such as Northern Wei, whose dynastic rulers were of the Tuoba (Tabgach) clan of the Xianbei. Eventually the whole Jin state was replaced by Liu Song, in 419/420. This new dynasty was named Song (like the much later, larger dynasty) and was ruled by the Liu family, and was also corrupt and short-lived. Versions of Tao Yuanming&#x27;s biography in the Chinese source material vary as to his name and age during the various historical events of Eastern Jin and Liu Song known from other sources.

===Birth===

Tao Yuanming was born during the Eastern Jin dynasty (317–420), in Chaisang, which is now a district of the city of Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province.

====Year of birth controversy====
Tao Yuanming is generally believed to have been born in the year 365 CE in Chaisang (; modern Jiujiang), an area of great natural beauty. At the time Jiujiang was named Jiangzhou, and had an actively Buddhist governor. This birthdate is confirmed in Tao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, which says he was born &quot;in the third year of the Xingning Reign Period of Emperor Ai&quot;, or Common Era year 365. But there is some uncertainty about this date, and the scholar Yuan Xingpei has argued that Tao was actually born in 352.

====Place of birth====
The name of Tao Yuanming&#x27;s ancestral village, Chaisang, literally means &quot;Mulberry-Bramble&quot;. Nearby sights have included Mountain Lu, Poyang Lake (then known as P&#x27;eng-li), as well as a good selection of natural features.

===Younger years===
Detailed information on Tao Yuanming&#x27;s younger years is not known, but it is safe to say that they were lived in a difficult environment. When he was 18 or 19, both the invasion by the state of Former Qin (ruled by an ethnically &quot;Hu&quot; dynasty) and the events culminating in the Battle of Fei River (383) occurred; after great risk to the existence of Eastern Jin, this, against the odds, resulted in gains of territory north of the Yangzi, while also whetting Eastern Jin appetites for reconquering the former northern territories. Many events occurred during Tao&#x27;s lifetime, including two revolts leading to the usurpation of the throne, and, in his old age, the overthrow of Eastern Jin.

====Incident at Tiger Creek Bridge====

Tao Yuanming&#x27;s birthplace was near Mountain Lu, which became a center of Buddhism and a source of origin for Pure Land Buddhism. According to historical accounts, in the 11th year of Emperor Xiaowu of Jin&#x27;s Taiyuan reign period (386), when Tao Yuanming was 21 years old, Buddhist priest Huiyuan (later considered the First Ancestor of Pure Land Buddhism) came to build the Donglin Monastery and organized the White Lotus Society, or a branch thereof. Many scholars and poets participated in the Huiyuan&#x27;s social circle, centered at the mountain monastery. According to &quot;Stories of Worthy Personages in the Lotus Society&quot; (), Huiyuan never left the monastery, except for one time. The official border of the monastery was known as Tiger Creek (or Tiger Gorge), named for the tigers that inhabited the neighboring hills and over which spanned a bridge. Once, after Tao and another scholar visited, Huiyuan became so wrapped up in conversation with his guests while seeing them out that he did not notice he was leaving the monastery grounds. Upon crossing the Tiger Creek Bridge, the local tigers were so astonished at this departure from the Master&#x27;s practice of never leaving the monastery grounds that they began to roar and howl. Once Huiyuan realized he had breached his practice, all three burst out laughing. This incident later became the subject of the paintings of &quot;Three Laughing Men at Tiger Creek&quot; (; Pinyin: &quot;hǔ xī sān xiào&quot;).

===Government service===
Tao Yuanming did more than ten years of government service, personally involved with the sordid political scene of the times, which he did in five stints. Tao served in both civil and military capacities, making several trips down the Yangzi to the capital Jiankang, then a thriving metropolis and the center of power during the Six Dynasties. The ruins of the old Jiankang walls are in Nanjing. During this period, Tao&#x27;s poems begin to indicate that he was becoming torn between ambition and a desire to retreat into solitude.

====Political background====
Enough is known of the general state of affairs during Tao&#x27;s governmental career to indicate why his service was so miserable for him: Tao served under the two usurpers Huan Xuan and Liu Yu, not to mention the weak Emperor An of Jin.

The future Emperor An (born 382 and personally named Sima Dezong) was a scion of the dynastic ruling family of the Jin empire, the Sima. His father was emperor Xiaowu, who named him crown prince in 387 despite his extreme developmental disabilities (he could not dress himself, speak, or generally communicate). When Xiaowu was murdered in bed by his secondary wife, the Lady Zhang, An was crowned emperor in 397. Acting as regent, actual control of the empire was in the hands of An&#x27;s father&#x27;s younger brother Sima Daozi, who could dress himself and communicate verbally, but nevertheless was not that capable a ruler, with a reputation for feasting and drinking rather than attending to affairs of state, and surrounding himself with flatterers. Various insurrections developed during the span of this corrupt and incompetent government, mostly unsuccessful, a state of affairs that did not change much when Sima Daozi&#x27;s son Sima Yuanxian succeeded as regent (which reportedly happened while Sima Daozi was drunk). Eventually the warlord Huan Xuan consolidated enough power to seize the regency for himself. Huan Xuan was a kleptocrat, who found ways to seize valuable objects or properties he envied. He also had a habit of tyrannically punishing any official who made the slightest mistake or whom he was suspicious of. In 403, Huan had Emperor An abdicate so that he himself could be ruler both in fact and in name, and renamed his empire the Chu dynasty. Shortly thereafter Huan was killed an uprising, in 404/405. The rebels then restored An as emperor and the empire&#x27;s name to Jin. The rebels&#x27; leader was Huan&#x27;s general Liu Yu, who ruled as regent for Emperor An. A typical pattern of external warfare and rebellions from within followed. In 418/419 Liu had an assassin kill An. Liu installed An&#x27;s younger brother Sima Dewen as Emperor Gong of Jin, with Liu retaining the real power. Liu then forced Gong to abdicate, and not long after had him assassinated. Upon Gong&#x27;s abdication, Liu had himself named Emperor Wu of Song, officially ending the Jin dynasty. This is the government in which Tao Yuanming served, and his poems portray his increasing discontent with doing so. Whether he was really inclined to do so is less clear (and he seems to have family reasons for his decision to resign). Nevertheless, after around a decade of service, Tao left the government and returned to his home region.

====Five stints as a government official====
Tao Yuanming&#x27;s first stint in government was as State Officer of Rites, when he was about twenty-nine. He did this in part due to family poverty, and to support his aged parents. However, he had a difficult time of it and returned home. Accounts of Tao&#x27;s second and third government service stints vary somewhat. One source of information is &quot;A Year-by-Year Biography of Tao Yuanming&quot; by Lu Qingli. Tao&#x27;s second stint in government seems to have been working for Huan Xuan. According to Lu, Tao served in the government during the Long&#x27;an years of emperor An, during the time of the Sun En revolt. (Sun En seems to have been a populist magician associated with the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice movement.) Tao would have been about thirty-five years old, and the warlord Huan Xuan had become governor of Tao&#x27;s home province, Jiangzhou. Huan had a plan to coordinate with other warlords (including Liu Yu) to eradicate Sun En. Again according to Lu, Tao Yuanming was the official to go to the imperial capital, Jiankang, and officially submit this proposal to the imperial government. After receiving approval, Huan and associates successfully subdued the rebellion. Then, about three tears later, Huan Xuan and other warlords rebelled, and captured both the capital city and the emperor, An, and thus the imperial power. But by this time Tao Yuanming was working not for Huan but as Defense Strategist (apparently his third stint as a government official), handling paperwork for Liu Yu, the general in charge of defending the Sima-lead imperial government. There was also a fourth stint. When he was about forty, Tao worked for general Liu Jingxuan, who resigned about a year later, and Tao along with him. Tao Yuanming&#x27;s fifth and final stint, as Penze county magistrate (beginning March of the first year of the Yixing regnal year), only lasted about eighty days, as he resigned in August the same year. This was the time period when he wrote his essay &quot;To Return&quot;, in his preface to which he mentions taking the job because having &quot;a house full of little kids&quot;, and goes on to explain why he wants to give up government work and return home. Each stint seems to have lasted no more than a few years, and each time Tao Yuanming seems to have resigned and returned home. Officially, his retirement was due to the sudden death of his younger sister and his need to attend to the funeral rites. Another reason, given by his biographer Xiao Tong, was that Tao was faced with the imminent imposition of an onerous supervisor, whom he was told he &quot;had to treat right&quot;, and which was the occasion of him saying, &quot;I won&#x27;t bow to a bucolic boy for the sake of five pecks of rice.&quot; Subsequently, despite various offers by Liu Yu, after he became emperor, Tao Yuanming refused to return to government service. Of Tao Yuanming&#x27;s career Su Shi describe him as &quot;working for the government when he desired to, without feeling shame in his requests; retiring when he desired to, without thinking himself lofty.&quot;

===Return to the fields===
In the Spring of 405, Tao Yuanming was serving in the army, as aide-de-camp to the local commanding officer. The death of his sister together with his disgust at the corruption and infighting of the Jin Court prompted him to resign. As Tao himself put it, he would not &quot;bow like a servant in return for five pecks of grain&quot; (), a saying which has entered common usage meaning &quot;swallowing one&#x27;s pride in exchange for a meager existence&quot;. &quot;Five pecks of grain&quot; was among other things the specified salary of certain low-rank officials. Certainly Tao Yuanming&#x27;s salary as Penze County Magistrate was far higher than five pecks, so this was a symbolic expression. For the last 22 years of his life, he lived in retirement on his small farmstead.

===Children and family===
Tao Yuanming married two times. His first wife died when he was in his thirties.

Tao Yuanming had five sons. The oldest son was Tao Yan, as mentioned in his letter &quot;A Letter to My Sons Yan, Etc.&quot;, a sort of apology for any hunger or cold which they suffered as a result of following his ideal and conscience and not working for the government anymore. The daughters, if any, were unrecorded (as customary). However, just how this occurred within the chronology of his life is unknown.

===Religious and philosophical influences===
Tao Yuanming&#x27;s works show a certain spiritual side to them. The three main sources of religious/philosophical influence on Tao Yuanming were Confucian, Buddhist, and Taoist.

In his youth, Tao says, &quot;I enjoyed studying the Six Classics.&quot; He mentions this in Title 16 of his &quot;Drinking Poems&quot; series. The Six Classics refers to the fundamental Confucian texts now known as the Five Classics, due to the loss of the &quot;Book of Music&quot;). Tao shows his Taoist influence in various works; for example, through such lines as &quot;I long to return to Nature&quot; from his poem &quot;Returning to Country and Farming&quot;, or his sentiments in his essay &quot;Return&quot;. In these texts, Tao deprecates artificial limits or restrictions in interpersonal relationships, instead expressing the desire for a simple life, with nature taking its course. Also in &quot;Returning to Country and Farming&quot;, Tao Yuanming shows a Buddhist side (although he never formally became a Buddhist): &quot;Life is like an illusion; everything returns to emptiness,&quot; he says, echoing the Buddhist sutras. His ability to absorb and creatively employ the three diverse religions/philosophies leads Florence Chia-ying Yeh to say: &quot;Among the Chinese poets, Tao Yuanming had the greatest perseverance and integrity. His power to persevere was based upon his acceptance and absorption of the essentials of various philosophies, such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. He mastered not only the external words, doctrines, and rituals, but also had a thorough internal understanding and acceptance of the best and most valuable parts of those schools of thought.&quot;

===Death===
His main biographies give Tao Yuanming&#x27;s death as &quot;in the fourth year of the Yuanjia reign period of Emperor Wen&quot;. Thus, Tao Qian is generally but not universally held to have died in 427, which mathematically works out to the age of 63. If, however, he was in fact born in 352, he would instead have been 76 years old when he died.

==Sources==
There are various sources with information about Tao Yuanming. As he lived in the Jin dynasty, he is chronicled in the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;. Since he lived into Liu Song times, he is also chronicled in the &quot;Book of Song&quot;. Tao Yuanming has another biography in the &quot;History of the South&quot;. There is also some information to be found in his preserved works, which were first systematically collected by Xiao Tong, a Liang dynasty prince (princely title Zhaoming), who also included a biography in his book &quot;Wen Xuan&quot;.

==Works and legacy==
Approximately 130 of his works survive, consisting mostly of poems or essays which depict an idyllic pastoral life of farming and drinking.

===Poetry===

Because his poems depict a life of farming and of drinking his homemade wine, he would later be termed &quot;Poet of the Fields&quot;. In Tao Yuanming&#x27;s poems can be found superlative examples of the theme which urges its audience to drop out of official life, move to the country, and take up a cultivated life of wine, poetry, and avoiding people with whom friendship would be unsuitable, but in Tao&#x27;s case this went along with actually engaging in farming. Tao&#x27;s poetry also shows an inclination to fulfillment of duty, such as feeding his family. Tao&#x27;s simple and plain style of expression, reflecting his back-to-basics lifestyle, first became better known as he achieved local fame as a hermit. This was followed gradually by recognition in major anthologies. By the Tang dynasty, Tao was elevated to greatness as a poet&#x27;s poet, revered by Li Bai and Du Fu.

Han poetry, Jian&#x27;an poetry, the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove, and the other earlier Six dynasties poetry foreshadowed some of Tao&#x27;s particular symbolism and the general &quot;returning home to the country&quot; theme, and also somewhat separately show precursory in evolving of poetic form, based on the &quot;yuefu&quot; style which traces its origin to the Han dynasty Music Bureau. An example given of the thematic evolution of one of Tao&#x27;s poetic themes is Zhang Heng&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Field&quot;, written in the Classical Chinese poetry form known as the &quot;fu&quot;, or &quot;rhapsody&quot; style, but Tao&#x27;s own poetry (including his own &quot;Return to the Field&quot; poem) tends to be known for its use of the more purely poetic &quot;shi&quot; which developed as a regular line length form from the literary &quot;yuefu&quot; of the Jian&#x27;an and foreshadows the verse forms favored in Tang poetry, such as &quot;gushi&quot;, or &quot;old-style verse&quot;. Tao&#x27;s poems, prose and their combination of form and theme into his own style broke new ground and became a fondly relied upon historical landmark. Much subsequent Chinese painting and literature would require no more than the mention or image of chrysanthemums by the eastern fence to call to mind Tao Yuanming&#x27;s life and poetry. Later, his poetry and the particular motifs which Tao Yuanming exemplified would prove to importantly influence the innovations of Beat poetry and the 1960s poetry of the United States and Europe. Both in the 20th century and subsequently, Tao Yuanming has come to occupy a position as one of the select group of great world poets.

====Poems====
The following is an extract from a poem Tao wrote, in the year 409, in regard to a traditional Chinese holiday:

&lt;poem&gt;
:Written on the Ninth Day of the Ninth Month of the Year &quot;yi-yu&quot;

:&quot;The myriad transformations&quot;
:&quot; unravel one another&quot;
:&quot;And human life&quot;
:&quot; how should it not be hard?&quot;
:&quot;From ancient times&quot;
:&quot; there was none but had to die,&quot;
:&quot; Remembering this&quot;
:&quot;scorches my very heart.&quot;
:&quot; What is there I can do&quot;
:&quot; to assuage this mood?&quot;
:&quot; Only enjoy myself&quot;
:&quot; drinking my unstrained wine.&quot;
:&quot; I do not know&quot;
:&quot; about a thousand years,&quot;
:&quot; Rather let me make&quot;
:&quot; this morning last forever.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Poem number five of Tao&#x27;s &quot;Drinking Wine&quot; series is translated by Arthur Waley:

&lt;poem&gt;
I built my hut in a zone of human habitation

 my hut in a zone of human habitation,
Yet near me there sounds no noise of horse or coach.
Would you know how that is possible?
A heart that is distant creates a wilderness round it.
I pluck chrysanthemums under the eastern hedge,
Then gaze long at the distant summer hills.
The mountain air is fresh at the dusk of day:
The flying birds two by two return.
In these things there lies a deep meaning;
Yet when we would express it, words suddenly fail us.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Another, from the same source is &quot;Returning to the Fields&quot; (alternatively translated by others as &quot;Return to the Field&quot;):

&lt;poem&gt;
 I was young, I was out of tune with the herd:
My only love was for the hills and mountains.
Unwitting I fell into the Web of the World&#x27;s dust
And was not free until my thirtieth year.
The migrant bird longs for the old wood:
The fish in the tank thinks of its native pool.
I had rescued from wildness a patch of the Southern Moor
And, still rustic, I returned to field and garden.
My ground covers no more than ten acres:
My thatched cottage has eight or nine rooms.
Elms and willows cluster by the eaves:
Peach trees and plum trees grow before the hall.
Hazy, hazy the distant hamlets of men.
Steady the smoke of the half-deserted village,
A dog barks somewhere in the deep lanes,
A cock crows at the top of the mulberry tree.
At gate and courtyard—no murmur of the World&#x27;s dust:
In the empty rooms—leisure and deep stillness.
Long I lived checked by the bars of a cage:
Now I have turned again to Nature and Freedom.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Tao&#x27;s poems greatly influenced the ensuing poetry of the Tang and Song Dynasties. A great admirer of Tao, Du Fu wrote a poem &quot;Oh, Such a Shame&quot; of life in the countryside:

:&quot;Only by wine one&#x27;s heart is lit,&quot;
:&quot;only a poem calms a soul that&#x27;s torn.&quot;
:&quot;You&#x27;d understand me, Tao Qian.&quot;
:&quot;I wish a little sooner I was born!&quot;

===&quot;Peach Blossom Spring&quot;===
Aside from his poems, Tao is also known for his short, influential, and intriguing prose depiction of a land hidden from the outside world called &quot;Peach Blossom Spring&quot; (). The name &quot;Peach Blossom Spring&quot; (, &quot;Tao Hua Yuan&quot;) is now a well known, standard Chinese term for a utopia. This fable recounted by Tao Yuanming begins with a claim that it occurred in the Taiyuan era of the Jin dynasty (376–396). According to the story, a fisher gets lost and discovers a place out of time, but cannot find it again after he leaves and tells of its existence. It is a very influential story.

Tao Yuanming&#x27;s literary legacy also includes his influence on later poets and authors. One example is Song dynasty poet Xin Qiji. Another example is Su Shi&#x27;s composition &quot;Matching Tao&#x27;s Poems&quot;, in which the Song dynasty poet wrote a new poem in response to Tao&#x27;s poems, but used the same rhymes for his lines. Another poet inspired in part by Tao Yuanming was the 16th century Korean poet Yi Hwang.

==Critical appraisal==
Zhong Rong (468–518) described Yuanming&#x27;s literary style as &quot;spare and limpid, with scarcely a surplus word.&quot; In &quot;Poetry Gradings&quot; () Zhong Rong wrote:

[Yuanming&#x27;s] sincerity is true and traditional, his verbalized inspirations supple and relaxed. When one reads his works, the fine character of the poet himself comes to mind. Ordinary men admire his unadorned directness. But such lines of his as &quot;With happy face I pour the spring-brewed wine,&quot; and &quot;The sun sets, no clouds are in the sky,&quot; are pure and refined in the beauty of their air. These are far from being merely the words of a farmer. He is the father of recluse poetry past and present.
Su Shi (1037–1101), one of the major poets of the Song era, said that the only poet he was particularly fond of was Yuanming, who &quot;deeply impressed [him] by what he was as a man.&quot; Su Shi exalted Yuanming&#x27;s &quot;unadorned and yet beautiful, spare and yet ample&quot; poems, and even asserted that &quot;neither Cao Zhi, Liu Zhen, Bao Zhao, Xie Lingyun, Li Bai, nor Du Fu achieves his stature&quot;.

Huang Tingjian (1045–1105), one of the Four Masters of the Song dynasty and a younger friend of Su Shi, said, &quot;“When you’ve just come of age, reading these poems seems like gnawing on withered wood. But reading them after long experience in the world, it seems the decisions of your life were all made in ignorance.”

Lin Yutang (1895–1976) considered Yuanming the perfect example of &quot;the true lover of life&quot;. He praised the harmony and simplicity in Yuanming&#x27;s life as well as in his style, and claimed that he &quot;represents the most perfectly harmonious and well-rounded character in the entire Chinese literary tradition.&quot;

In &quot;Great lives from history&quot; (1988), Frank Northen Magill highlights the &quot;candid beauty&quot; of Yuanming&#x27;s poetry, stating that the &quot;freshness of his images, his homespun but Heaven-aspiring morality, and his steadfast love of rural life shine through the deceptively humble words in which they are expressed, and as a consequence he has long been regarded one of China&#x27;s most accomplished and accessible poets.&quot; He also discusses what makes Yuanming unique as a poet, and why his works were perhaps overlooked by his contemporaries:

It is this fundamental love of simplicity that distinguishes T&#x27;ao Ch&#x27;ien&#x27;s verses from the works of court poets of his time, who utilized obscure allusions and complicated stylistic devices to fashion verses that appealed only to the highly educated. T&#x27;ao Ch&#x27;ien, by way of contrast, seldom made any literary allusions whatsoever, and he wrote for the widest possible audience. As a consequence, he was slighted by his era&#x27;s critics and only fully appreciated by later generations of readers.

<text>The black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) is a seabird species in the gull family Laridae. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Larus tridactylus&quot;. The English name is derived from its call, a shrill &#x27;kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake&#x27;. In North America, this species is known as the black-legged kittiwake to differentiate it from the red-legged kittiwake, but in Europe, where it is the only member of the genus, it is often known just as kittiwake.

==Taxonomy==
The black-legged kittiwake was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed with the gulls in the genus &quot;Larus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Larus tridactylus&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type location as northern Europe but this has been restricted to Great Britain. The black-legged kittiwake is now placed together with the red-legged kittiwake in the genus &quot;Rissa&quot; that was introduced in 1826 by the English naturalist James Stephens. The genus name is from the Icelandic word &quot;rita&quot; for a black-legged kittiwake. The specific &quot;tridactyla&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;tridaktulos&quot; meaning &quot;three-toed&quot;. The English name &quot;kittiwake&quot; is derived from its call, a shrill &#x27;kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake&#x27;.

===Subspecies===
Two subspecies are recognised. These are listed below together with their breeding ranges.
* &quot;R. t. tridactyla&quot; : North Atlantic Ocean, from high Arctic to temperate coasts, in Greenland, Iceland, west and northwest Europe, Svalbard and northwest New Siberian Islands, the Canadian high Arctic (northeast Canada), Gulf of St. Lawrence and Newfoundland (southeast Canada). Unique among the Laridae in having only a very small or even no hind toe.
* &quot;R. t. pollicaris&quot; : North Pacific Ocean, from high Arctic to temperate north coasts, from the northeast New Siberian Islands to Sakhalin, Kamchatka Peninsula, Kuril and Commander Islands (east Russia), the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea islands, and west and southwest Alaska mainland. Hind toe (as the name &quot;pollex&quot;, meaning thumb, suggests) present.
Apart from the hind toe, the two subspecies are almost identical, &quot;R. tridactyla pollicaris&quot; is in general slightly larger than &quot;R. tridactyla tridactyla&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-legged kittiwake is a coastal bird of the arctic to subarctic regions of the world. It can be found all across the northern coasts of the Atlantic, from Canada to Greenland as well as on the Pacific side from Alaska to the coast of Siberia. Black-legged kittiwakes&#x27; wintering range extends further south from the St-Lawrence to the southern coast of New Jersey as well as in China, the Sargasso sea and off the coast of west Africa. There are two subspecies of black-legged kittiwake. &quot;Rissa tridactyla tridactyla&quot; can be found on the Atlantic coast whereas &quot;Rissa tridactyla pollicaris&quot; is found on the Pacific coast.
Out of all the gulls, the kittiwakes are the most pelagic ones, except for perhaps Sabine&#x27;s gull. Kittiwakes are almost exclusively found at sea with the exception of the breeding period, from May to September, where they can be found nesting on the sheerest sea cliffs. They are rarely found inland, though occasional vagrants can turn up far inland, even in central Asia well over a thousand km from the sea. For the rest of the year, kittiwake spend most of their time on the wing out of sight from the coast.

==Description==
=== Adult plumage ===
The adult is in length with a wingspan of and a body mass of . It has a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black, black legs and a yellow bill. Occasional individuals have pinky-grey to reddish legs, inviting confusion with red-legged kittiwake. The inside of their mouth is also a characteristic feature of the species due to its rich red colour. Such red pigmentation is due to carotenoids pigments and vitamin A which have to be acquired through their diet. Studies show that integument colour is associated with male&#x27;s reproductive success. This hypothesis would explain the behaviour of couples greeting each other by opening their mouth and flashing their bright mouth it to their partner while calling. As their Latin name suggests, they only possess three toes since their hind toe is either extremely reduced or completely absent. In winter, the species acquires a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar. The bill also turns a dusky-olive colour.

Kittiwakes are similar to most other gulls in their moulting pattern with one full moult and one partial moult each year. The full moult from summer to winter plumage though is very protracted, beginning as early as late May or June, and continuing through summer until completed by October, or rarely as late as the end of the year. Then in early spring, there is a partial moult (head and body feathers, but not the wing or tail feathers) from winter plumage to summer plumage in March to early April.

=== Juvenile plumage ===
At fledging, the juveniles differ from the adults in having a black &#x27;W&#x27; band across the length of the wings and whiter secondary and primary feathers behind the black &#x27;W&#x27;, a black hind-neck collar and a black terminal band on the tail. They can also be identified due to their solid black bill. This plumage is a hatch-year plumage and will only remain for their first year. Kittiwakes obtain their mature plumage at 4 years old, but will gradually change their juvenile plumage over time until maturity is reached. A second-year juvenile resembles a hatch-year regarding the plumage, though the bill is no longer solid black but instead has a greenish colour. The black marking on the coverts and the tail is still visible. The black marking will only moult during their third year, where the black is no longer present on the coverts, but the grey smudge on the head remains. A third-year bird will also exhibit a small zone of bright yellow/orange at the base of its mostly greenish bill. It is only at four years old that the bill will reach an overall colour of bright yellow and complete its mature plumage.

The old fisherman&#x27;s name of &quot;tarrock&quot; for juvenile kittiwakes is still occasionally used.
=== Calls ===

The kittiwake is named after its call that resembles a long &quot;kit-ti-wake&quot;. Apart from their typical call, kittiwakes have a wide array of calls. Their greeting call is used by the two members of a pair when meeting at the nest after an absence of one or both members. Before and during copulation, the female will often call by making a series of short high pitched &quot;squeak&quot;. This call is also used by the female to beg for food from the male (courtship feeding). When predators are around, the kittiwake alarm call, an &quot;oh oh oh oh&quot; will be heard all across the colony. Kittiwake will call all day for various reasons and will only stop when the sun is down.

=== Similar species ===
The red-legged kittiwake is the only other species in the genus &quot;Rissa&quot; and can be differentiated from its counterpart by its red legs, as the name suggests. The head of the red-legged kittiwake is slightly smaller and bears a shorter bill. The chicks of the Pacific black-legged kittiwake and red-legged kittiwake cannot be distinguished during their youngest downy phase.

Juvenile black-legged kittiwakes can be confused with juvenile little gull and both juvenile and adult Sabine&#x27;s gull, although the kittiwakes&#x27; plumage has broader black &#x27;W&#x27; on the wing, the primaries and a different pattern going across the coverts.

==Behaviour and ecology==
=== Flight ===
Kittiwake are known for their graceful flight. Unlike larger gulls, their flight is light with the wings beating in fast strokes. When looking at them flying around the colony, kittiwakes often look as if they are playing in the wind with their agile flips and loops. Kittiwakes are highly gregarious and therefore are rarely seen flying alone far away from the colony.

===Breeding===

It is a coastal breeding bird around the north Pacific and north Atlantic oceans, found most commonly in North America and Europe. Kittiwakes are colonial nesters that form monogamous pairs and exhibit biparental care, meaning that both take part in nest building, incubation and chick rearing. They tend to nest in large numbers on cliffs by the sea side. It breeds in large colonies on cliffs and is very noisy on the breeding ground. Cliff nesting for gulls occurs only in the &quot;Rissa&quot; species, and the kittiwake is capable of utilizing the very sheerest of vertical cliffs, as is evident in their nesting sites on Staple Island in the outer Farne Islands.

Black-legged kittiwake gulls traditionally preferred nesting on natural cliffs and ledges, and there are historically few instances of kittiwakes nesting on man-made structures. The first nesting on buildings on the River Tyne in Northumberland, UK, began in 1949 at North Shields and then colonised further upstream, with nesting on buildings in central Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead from the early 1960s; by 2020, 1,639 pairs were nesting on buildings along the Tyne (of which 879 pairs on the iconic Tyne Bridge in the heart of Newcastle), with the furthest inland 17 km upriver from the sea. In recent years, some have even been nesting successfully on top of street lights on Newcastle&#x27;s Quayside. A shift in nesting behaviour has also been noted in the coastal areas of Northern Norway.

==== Nesting ====
Kittiwake pairs both participate in building the nest in which the female will lay their eggs. The breeding season begins with nest refurbishment in late March or early April, and egg-laying from late April, and usually ends in August.Building the nest in order to welcome their fragile eggs is a tedious task and requires time and energy. The parents begin with a layer of mud and grass in order to form a platform that will cushion and help to isolate the eggs from the cold ground. A cup is then built around the platform in order to keep the eggs from rolling out of the nest. Finally, the nest is lined with soft and dry material such as moss, grass or seaweed. The nest is solidified by a continuous trampling of the materials by the pair. Throughout this period, the male will do courtship feeding by feeding the female at their nest site. The reasons for such behaviour are not quite understood but many hypotheses have been brought up to explain the phenomenon. Hypothesis such as the &quot;nutrition hypothesis&quot; and the &quot;copulation enhancement hypothesis&quot; have shown evidence that this behaviour evolved either through natural or sexual selection.

==== Eggs and incubation ====

Kittiwakes are single-brooded, meaning that the pair will only reproduce once per year. Egg formation within the female usually takes around 15 days and normal egg clutch size ranges from one to two sub-elliptical eggs, though three eggs clutches are not impossible. The female will lay eggs on alternate days. The egg colour is variable, ranging from white, brownish to turquoise with dark brown speckles. Once the eggs are laid, the parents will take turns and incubate their clutch for an average period of 27 days. In case of egg loss, the female might relay another egg within 15 days after the loss.

==== Chick-rearing ====

Chicks usually hatched through the larger end of the egg using their egg tooth. The egg tooth usually disappear after seven days post-hatching. The alpha and beta chicks tend to hatch 1.3 days apart. Kittiwake are born semi-precocial. The downy young of kittiwakes are white, since they have no need of camouflage from predators, and do not wander from the nest like &quot;Larus&quot; gulls for obvious safety reasons. Regardless of predation, the chicks are most vulnerable within their first week due to their incapacity to properly thermoregulate during that period. Kittiwake chicks also exhibit siblicide, meaning that the first-born chick may kill its sibling in order to avoid competition for food from their parents. If siblicide is to occur, it will most likely occur within the first 10 days of life of the smaller chick, in most cases the last born.

The downy plumage of chicks start to be replaced by the juvenile plumage only five days after hatching and will continue to do so for about 30 days, until the juvenile plumage is complete. It is not long after the completion of their juvenile plumage that the chicks will have their first flight at 34–58 days old. Chicks will come back to the nest for several weeks after hatching and will eventually follow the adults at sea where they spend the winter. Kittiwakes reach sexual maturity at around 4–5 years old.

=== Food and feeding ===
Kittiwakes are primarily pelagic piscivorous birds. Their main food source consists of fish, though it is not unlikely to find invertebrates such as copepods, polychete and squids in their diet, especially when fish is harder to find. Due to their wide range, kittiwake diet is quite variable. In the Gulf of Alaska, their diet is usually composed of Pacific capelin, Pacific herring, Pacific sand land and much more. Kittiwakes of the coast of the United Kingdom, in Europe, rely mostly on sandeels. In 2004, the kittiwake population in the Shetland islands, along with the murre (guillemot) and tern population, completely failed to reproduce successfully due to a collapse in sandeel stock. Like most gulls, kittiwake forage at the surface of the water where they tend to catch their prey while in flight or sitting on the water. Throughout winter, kittiwakes spend all of their time at sea where they forage. Unlike some gull species, they do not scavenge at landfills.

The foraging style of the kittiwakes is often compared to the terns&#x27; foraging strategy due to their frequent hovering and their head diving quickly at the surface of the water. Instances of kittiwakes following whales are also common since they benefit from the fish fragments expelled by these huge marine mammals. Fishers and commercial fishing boats are also the frequent witnesses of big groups of kittiwakes, often mixed with other gull species and terns, hovering around their ship in order to benefit from the scraps rejected in their sewage water or thrown overboard.

There are few studies focussing on their water needs, though they seem to prefer salt water to fresh water. Captive kittiwakes are known to refuse fresh water but will willingly drink salt water.

== Relationship with humans ==
Kittiwakes are a frequent encounter of fisheries in northern regions. Their diet consisting almost exclusively of fish, fishermen tend to seek large aggregation of seabirds since they are often a sign of fish abundance. On the other hand, kittiwake and other seabirds hang around fishing boats or platforms to collect scraps or any fish that might have been left out. Due to the pelagic lifestyle of kittiwakes, they rarely interact with humans on the land, other than occasional sight near the ocean&#x27;s coast.

In New England, the black-legged kittiwake is often called the &quot;winter gull&quot; since its arrival often signals to people that winter is coming.

The city of Tromsø, along with other cities in the far north of Norway, has experienced a remarkable increase in the number of kittiwakes choosing to use city structures as nesting sites. This rise in urban nesting populations has seen the number of pairs increase from 13 in 2017 to over 380 in 2022. Researchers attribute this climate change related breeding failures, along with the absence of natural predators in the city, providing a safer environment for the gulls to breed and raise their young. The increasing nesting population has created challenges, as the gulls produce ammonia-smelling faeces, discolouring buildings and streets, as well as the noise pollution generated by their constant &#x27;kittiwake&#x27; calling.

To address these challenges, innovative measures have been implemented in Tromsø. One such initiative involves the establishment of &quot;Kittiwake hotels&quot;, artificial bird cliff structures built to encourage nesting away from urban facades. The hotels have, along with mitigation measures preventing nesting on the city&#x27;s structures, had success in attracting kittiwakes without having a negative impact on breeding.

=== Population trends ===
Since the 1970s, it has been believed that the global population of black-legged kittiwake has declined of about 40% in only three generations (one generation is in average 12.9 years), putting the species in a dangerous place for the future. The global population is estimated at 14,600,000-15,700,000 individuals and is in constant decline. The individual distribution of kittiwakes across the world varies quite a bit, with Europe representing more than 50% of the world&#x27;s kittiwake and North America representing only 20%. In their recent species assessment, the IUCN Red List pointed out that all but one populations of kittiwakes were in decline, with the exception of the small Canadian arctic population that seems to be increasing at a rate of 1% per year. The last IUCN Red List report in 2017, the species was moved from &quot;least concern&quot; to a &quot;vulnerable&quot; status on a global scale.

=== Threats ===

==== Fisheries ====
Since the kittiwakes are fish specialist and tend to rely on prey species, their reproductive success highly depends on fish availability. Commercial fisheries have been known to have many direct and indirect impacts on their surrounding ecosystem. Direct impacts on the fish species themselves are well known, but the presence of fisheries also has an array of impacts on marine predators that not only rely on the species harvested but also on the &quot;bycatch&quot; species. Fisheries harvesting species such as the sandeel, one of the main food source for kittiwakes in Europe, are known to have a huge impact of the reproductive success of local populations kittiwakes and other seabirds. Long-term research on the effect of food availability on kittiwakes in the Gulf of Alaska showed a direct correlation between food availability and reproductive success, using a supplemental-feeding experiment. Seabirds can also be a direct victim of fisheries. Their tendency to hang around them in hope of a good meal can lead to entanglements in fishing gear, often resulting in death by drowning.

==== Global warming ====
With global warming, the rising of ocean temperature is becoming a serious concern, affecting not only the marine flora and fauna but also the species exploiting the marine environment. Kittiwake are extremely sensitive to variation in food stocks. Such variations can be due to over exploitation, as mentioned above, but can also be due to variations in sea surface temperature. With the rising the sea surface temperature, many fishes, such as sandeels, are negatively affected by a rise in ocean temperature. Studies show that sandeels and many copepods populations are being negatively impacted due to increasing sea surface temperature. Such effect on marine species can have tremendous impact on breeding kittiwakes which rely almost exclusively on pelagic fishes, making food more scarce in a time of high energetic needs.

=== Conservation plan ===
There are still no global conservation plans for the black-legged kittiwake though the species is closely monitored for population trends shifts. There are currently no international legislations regarding this species. However, the black-legged kittiwake is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 that has been ratified by the US, Canada, Mexico, Russia and Japan. As for many gull species, the kittiwake is not a species of special interest for the public, therefore there are no education plans put in place in order to inform and educate people regarding this species.

<text>The British Open is a professional snooker tournament, held as a ranking tournament from 1985. It was not held for 17 years, from the 2004/2005 season until the 2021/2022 season, when it returned to the calendar. The event has had various sponsors and venues over the years. It took place around November each year. Prior to the 1999/2000 season, it was held later in the season. As a result, two tournaments were held in 1999, one for the 1998/1999 season and one for the 1999/2000 season. Since 2022, the tournament&#x27;s trophy is named the Clive Everton Trophy, after the popular commentator.

The reigning champion is Mark Selby who won his first title in 2024. The record for the most titles is held by Englishman Steve Davis with five, one ahead of Scots Stephen Hendry and John Higgins.

== History ==
The tournament began in 1980 as the British Gold Cup in the Assembly Rooms, Derby. It was a sixteen-man invitation event and was played on a round robin basis with the group winners advancing to the semi-finals. The next year Yamaha took over sponsorship and the tournament was renamed the Yamaha Organs Trophy. The next year the tournaments name was changed to International Masters. The top eight of the first round robin stage played in two further groups and the winners advanced to the final. For 1984 the field of the tournament was increased to 27 and nine three-man groups were organised. The winners played in three semi-final groups and the winners played in a three-man round robin final.

After WPBSA decided to increase the number of ranking events in 1984/1985 and Yamaha withdrew its sponsorship the event was renamed the British Open. Dulux was the sponsor of the event between 1985 and 1987. In the next six years the event had four different sponsors: MIM Britannia Unit Trusts in 1988, Anglian Windows in 1989, Pearl Assurance between 1990 and 1992, and Wickes Home Improvements in 1993. In 1990 FA Cup style draws were introduced from the last 32 stage of the event.

In 1994 the tournament was moved to the Plymouth Pavilions. Between 1994 and 2004 the event was sponsored in only three years by Castella in 1995 and 1996, and by Stan James in 2001. The event was moved to the first half of the calendar in 1999/2000. The event than moved to the Telewest Arena in Newcastle for 2001, the Telford International Centre for 2002 and the Brighton Centre for 2003 and 2004. The event was dropped from the calendar in 2005/2006.

There have been ten maximum breaks during the history of the tournament. James Wattana made the first in 1992 in the last 16 against Tony Drago. The second and third came at the qualifying stage of the event. David McDonnell compiled it in the fourth round of the 1995 event against Nic Barrow and Jason Prince in the fifth round of the first 1999 event against Ian Brumby. Graeme Dott made the fourth at the same event in the last 64 against David Roe. The fifth was Stephen Hendry&#x27;s sixth official maximum break, which he compiled in the final of the second 1999 event against Peter Ebdon. The sixth was compiled by John Higgins in 2003 in the last 32 against Michael Judge. The revived 2021 event recorded two maximum breaks. Higgins made one in the first frame of his first round win over Alexander Ursenbacher, while Ali Carter made his during the second frame of his fourth round match against Elliot Slessor. The ninth maximum was made in 2022 by Mark Selby in the third round against Jack Lisowski. The most recent maximum break was compiled in 2024 by Mark Allen in his third round match against Ben Mertens.

<text>In Dubious Battle is a novel by John Steinbeck, written in 1936. The central figure of the story is an activist attempting to organize abused laborers in order to gain fair wages and working conditions.

Prior to publication, Steinbeck wrote in a letter:

This is the first time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had anything to say to anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn&#x27;t be that. I&#x27;ve been living with this thing for some time now. I don&#x27;t know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man&#x27;s eternal, bitter warfare with himself.
==Explanation of the novel&#x27;s title==
The title is a reference to a passage from John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;:

Innumerable force of Spirits armed,
That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,
His utmost power with adverse power opposed
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?
All is not lost—the unconquerable will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield:
And what is else not to be overcome?
==Plot summary==

&quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; deals with a fruit-workers&#x27; strike in a California valley and the attempts of labor unions to organize, lead, and provide for the striking pickers.

Jim Nolan meets Harry Nilson who initiates Jim&#x27;s application process to become the newest member of the Communist Party. Mac &quot;Doc&quot; McLeod, the Party organizer, tells Jim they will go to the Torgas Valley (a composite location) in an attempt to rouse the two thousand fruit pickers against the Growers&#x27; Association, and to encourage the strike to spill over into the cotton fields in Tandale.

Momentum for strike action builds after old Dan breaks two rungs out of a ladder and falls. London becomes chairman of a committee of seven men, while Mac convinces Al Anderson&#x27;s father to loan five acres as a base for the fruit pickers in exchange for them picking his crop for free. Doc Burton is hired by Mac to maintain the sanitation of the strikers&#x27; camp, so as to prevent it from being disbanded by the Red Cross.

The course of the strike is recounted in some detail, including the politics of the local growers, the support by Al through his little luncheonette, the &quot;sweet-talking&quot; of some locals in order to garner food and other help for the pickers, and personal crises and tragedies in individual cases. Mac emerges as a heroic but quite single-minded figure; Jim&#x27;s occasional doubts are presented as well.

Jim joins Sam in a picket as they go after some &#x27;scabs&#x27; in the apple orchard. Sam&#x27;s pickets violently injure them. While out on the road Dakin, the leader of the pickers, is ambushed by a vigilante group at gunpoint. Later, the Anderson barn is burned down by vigilantes. In the aftermath, Jim is killed by a high powered shotgun. As the book ends, Mac is continuing to rouse and motivate the picketers, in spite of seemingly hopeless odds.

==Literary significance and criticism==
On publication, &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Fred T. March compared it to the &quot;genial gusto&quot; of the &quot;picaresque&quot; &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;. He commented that &quot;You would never know that &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; was by the same John Steinbeck if the publishers did not tell you so.&quot; He called it &quot;courageous and desperately honest,&quot; &quot;the best labor and strike novel to come out of our contemporary economic and social unrest,&quot; and &quot;such a novel as Sinclair Lewis at his best might have done had he gone on with his projected labor novel...&quot;

In 1943, with Steinbeck now famous, Carlos Baker &quot;revalued&quot; the novel. He opened by saying &quot;Among Steinbeck&#x27;s best novels, the least known is probably &quot;In Dubious Battle.&quot;&quot; Steinbeck, he said, &quot;is supremely interested in what happens to men&#x27;s minds and hearts when they function, not as responsible, self-governing individuals, but as members of a group... Biologists have a word for this very important problem; they call it bionomics, or ecology.&quot; He said that &quot;Steinbeck&#x27;s bionomic interest is visible in all that he has done, from &quot;Tortilla Flat&quot;, in the middle Thirties, through his semi-biological &quot;Sea of Cortez,&quot; to his latest communiqués as a war correspondent in England.&quot; He characterized &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; as &quot;an attempt to study a typical mid-depression strike in bionomic terms.&quot;

In 1958, critic Alfred Kazin referred to &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot; and &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; as &quot;his most powerful books,&quot; contrasting them with &quot;Cannery Row&quot; and &quot;The Wayward Bus&quot;. President Barack Obama told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that it was his favorite book by Steinbeck.

The novel likely recounts a fruit worker strike that occurred in Tulare County, California.

==Film adaptation==
On January 30, 2015, it was announced that James Franco would direct and star in a film version of the novel. The screenplay was written by Matt Rager and will be produced by AMBI Productions, Rabbit Bandini Productions, and That&#x27;s Hollywood Productions. The film stars Nat Wolff in the lead role, along with Josh Hutcherson, Bryan Cranston, Robert Duvall, Ed Harris, Selena Gomez, and others. Principal photography began on March 19, 2015 in Atlanta and Bostwick, Georgia. Additional footage was shot in orchards West of Yakima, Washington September 27 and 28, 2015. The film was released in theaters in the United States on February 17, 2017.

<text>Franz Kline (May 23, 1910 – May 13, 1962) was an American painter. He is associated with the Abstract Expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Kline, along with other action painters like Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, John Ferren, and Lee Krasner, as well as local poets, dancers, and musicians came to be known as the informal group, the New York School. Although he explored the same innovations to painting as the other artists in this group, Kline&#x27;s work is distinct in itself and has been revered since the 1950s.

==Biography==
Kline was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, a small community in the Coal Region of Northeastern Pennsylvania. When he was seven years old, Kline&#x27;s father killed himself. During his youth, he moved to Lehighton, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Lehighton High School. His mother later remarried and sent him to Girard College, an academy in Philadelphia for fatherless boys. After graduation from high school, Kline studied art at Boston University from 1931 to 1935, then spent a year in England attending the Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. During this time he met his future wife, Elizabeth V. Parsons, a British ballet dancer. She returned to the United States with Kline in 1938.

Upon his return to the country, Kline worked as a designer for a department store in New York state. He then moved to New York City in 1939 and worked for a scenic designer. It was during this time in New York that Kline developed his artistic techniques and gained recognition as a significant artist.

He later taught at a number of institutions, including Black Mountain College in North Carolina and the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. He spent summers from 1956 to 1962 painting in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and died in 1962 in New York City of a rheumatic heart disease, ten days before his 52nd birthday.

==Artistic development==
=== Early work ===
Kline&#x27;s artistic training focused on traditional illustrating and drafting. During the late 1930s and early 1940s Kline worked figuratively, painting landscapes and cityscapes in addition to commissioned portraits and murals. His individual style can be first seen in the mural series &quot;Hot Jazz&quot;, which he painted for the Bleecker Street Tavern in Greenwich Village in 1940.

The series revealed his interest in breaking down representative forms into quick, rudimentary brushstrokes.

The personal style he developed during this time, using simplified forms, became increasingly abstract. Many of the figures he depicted are based on the locomotives, stark landscapes, and large mechanical shapes of his native, coal-mining community in Pennsylvania. This is sometimes only apparent to viewers because the pieces are named after those places and objects, not because they actually look like the subject. With the influence of the contemporary New York art scene, Kline worked further into abstraction and eventually abandoned representationalism. From the late 1940s onward, Kline began generalizing his figurative subjects into lines and planes which fit together much like the works of Cubism of the time.

In 1946, the Lehighton, Pennsylvania, Post of the American Legion commissioned Kline to do a large canvas depicting the town where he had attended high school. The mural &quot;Lehighton&quot; was acquired from the American legion post in 2016 by the Allentown Art Museum in Allentown, Pennsylvania, and is today on permanent exhibition there.
===Later work===
It is widely believed that Kline&#x27;s most recognizable style derived from a suggestion made to him by his friend and creative influence, Willem de Kooning. De Kooning&#x27;s wife Elaine gave a romanticized account of the event, claiming that, in 1948, de Kooning advised an artistically frustrated Kline to project a sketch onto the wall of his studio, using a Bell–Opticon projector. Kline described the projection as such:

&quot;A four by five inch black drawing of a rocking chair...loomed in gigantic black strokes which eradicated any image, the strokes expanding as entities in themselves, unrelated to any entity but that of their own existence.&quot;

As Elaine de Kooning suggests, it was then that Kline dedicated himself to large-scale, abstract works and began developing his personal form of Abstract Expressionism. However, even though Willem de Kooning recalls that Kline delved into abstraction &quot;all of a sudden, he plunged into it&quot;, he also concedes that it took considerable time, stating that &quot;Franz had a vision of something and sometimes it takes quite a while to work it out.&quot; Over the next two years, Kline&#x27;s brushstrokes became completely non-representative, fluid, and dynamic. It was also at this time that Kline began painting only in black and white. He explained how his monochrome palette was meant to depict negative and positive space by saying, &quot;I paint the white as well as the black, and the white is just as important.&quot; His use of black and white is very similar to paintings made by de Kooning and Pollock during the 1940s. There also seem to be references to Japanese calligraphy in Kline&#x27;s black and white paintings, through his exchange with the Japanese avant-garde calligraphy group Bokujinkai and its leader Morita Shiryu, although Kline later denied that connection.

Kline&#x27;s first one-man show took place between October 16 and November 4, 1950, at the Egan Gallery, 63 East 57th Street, and consisted of eleven abstract paintings. Color was a rare element in the paintings: brown underpainting near the bottom of &quot;Nijinsky&quot; and fleeting hints of green in &quot;Leda&quot;. The paintings displayed a variety of compositions and moods, but they all had one defining trait: Kline&#x27;s signature style of black on white. In the early 1950s, his work appeared very much inspired by French painter Pierre Soulages, who had exhibited in Betty Parsons&#x27; gallery in New York in 1949. In the late 1930s in London, Kline had called himself a &quot;black and white man&quot;, but not until the Egan Gallery show had the accuracy of this phase become clear to others. Because of Kline&#x27;s impact and his concrete style, Kline was dubbed the &quot;black and white artist&quot;, a label which stuck with the artist, and by which he would occasionally feel restricted. Kline&#x27;s first one-man show was a pivotal event in Kline&#x27;s career as it marked the virtually simultaneous beginning and end of Kline&#x27;s major invention as an abstract artist. At the age of forty, Kline had secured a personal style which he had already mastered. There were no real ways for Kline to further his investigation; he only had the potential to replicate the style he had already mastered. To move on, there was only one logical direction for Kline to go: back to color, the direction he was headed at the time of his premature death from heart failure.

In the late 1950s, in such paintings as &quot;Requiem&quot; (1958), Kline began experimenting with more complex chiaroscuro instead of focusing on a strict monochromatic palette. Then in 1958, he reintroduced the use of color in his work through colorful accents in his black and white paintings. This exploration back to color-use was still in development when Kline died in 1962. A digital catalogue raisonne on &quot;Franz Kline Paintings, 1950-1962&quot; was recently published by the Hauser &amp; Wirth Institute using the Navigating.art platform.

== Interpretation and legacy ==
Kline is recognized as one of the most important yet problematic artists of the Abstract Expressionist movement in New York. His style is difficult for critics to interpret in relation to his contemporaries. 

Kline&#x27;s paintings are deceptively subtle. While generally his paintings have a spontaneous, and dramatic impact, Kline often closely referred to his compositional drawings. Kline carefully rendered many of his most complex pictures from extensive studies, commonly created on refuse telephone book pages. Unlike his fellow Abstract Expressionists, Kline&#x27;s works were only meant to look like they were done in a moment of inspiration; however, each painting was extensively explored before his housepainter&#x27;s brush touched the canvas.

Kline was also known for avoiding giving meaning to his paintings, unlike his colleagues who would give mystical descriptions of their works. In a catalog of Kline&#x27;s works, art historian Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev writes that &quot;his art both suggests and denies significance and meaning.&quot; Many of his works have been viewed by art historians as indications of a progression towards minimalist painting. They believe that his works hold an objective opacity and frankness that differs from the subjectivity involved with the New York School&#x27;s style. This would make his work more similar to the avant-garde platforms like minimalism that replaced the Abstract Expressionist movement in the 1960s.

Art historian David Anfam notes that artists working during Kline&#x27;s life and after—such as Robert Rauschenberg, Aaron Siskind, Cy Twombly, Mark di Suvero, and Brice Marden—have all called Kline an inspiration.

In 2024, Kline was announced as an inductee into the Luzerne County Arts &amp; Entertainment Hall of Fame.

==Art market==
In 2012, San Francisco financier George R. Roberts sold a nearly wide, untitled black-and-white work from 1957 at Christie&#x27;s, New York. The painting went to a telephone bidder for $36 million, or $40.4 million with fees (Christie&#x27;s guaranteed the seller Robert Mnuchin an undisclosed minimum), a record price for the artist at auction and more than six times the previous record, which was set in 2005 when Christie&#x27;s sold &quot;Crow Dancer&quot; (1958) for $6.4 million.

An early work, &quot;UNTITLED&quot;, from 1940 (of an interior room) was purchased from Sotheby&#x27;s in 1995 by a private collector for $21,850. This early piece helps to define his early phase, before his transformation from a realist painter to a groundbreaking abstract expressionist. The painting&#x27;s bold brushstrokes prefigure the epic black abstraction of his breakthrough style.

In 2018, the Hauser &amp; Wirth Institute in cooperation with the Estate of Franz Kline began preparing the catalogue raisonné &quot;Franz Kline Paintings, 1950–1962&quot;. The project, which presents for the first time an online compendium of Kline&#x27;s oil on canvas works made between 1950 and the artist&#x27;s death in 1962, was completed in 2022.

==Exhibitions==
Kline had his breakthrough show at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1950, and he participated in the 9th Street Art Exhibition the following year. In 1958, he was included in the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s major exhibition, &quot;The New American Painting&quot;, which toured eight European cities. In the decade before his death, his work was included in numerous international exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale (1956, 1960); Documenta, Kassel, West Germany (1959); São Paulo Biennial (1957); and Whitney Annuals and Biennials (1952, 1953, 1955, 1961). The Washington Gallery of Modern Art, Washington, D.C., organized a memorial exhibition (1962). Major monographic exhibitions have also been held at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1968); Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C. (1979); Cincinnati Art Museum, traveling to San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1985); Menil Collection, Houston (1994); Fundació Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona (1994); and Castello di Rivoli, Museo d&#x27;arte contemporanea, Italy (2004).
