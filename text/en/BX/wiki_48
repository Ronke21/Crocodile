<text>John Edward Thompson &quot;Jackie&quot; Milburn (11 May 1924 – 9 October 1988) was an English football player principally associated with Newcastle United and England, though he also spent four seasons at Linfield. He was also known as Wor Jackie (particularly in North East England, a Geordie dialectal, pronounced like “war”, meaning “our”, as in “Our Jackie”).

Cousin to the mother of Jack and Bobby Charlton, Milburn played two trial matches at St James&#x27; Park as a 19-year-old in 1943. In the second of these, he scored six second half goals. Milburn made his competitive debut in the FA Cup in the 1945–46 season and was initially deployed on the left wing as a supplier to Charlie Wayman. However, Wayman was dropped before a 4–0 defeat to eventual winners Charlton Athletic in a 1947 FA Cup semi-final and when he afterwards vowed not to play for United again, manager George Martin made the decision to switch Milburn to centre forward. In his next match, on 18 October 1947, Milburn wore the number nine shirt for the first time and scored a hat-trick.

Milburn&#x27;s subsequent achievements, particularly his two goals which won the 1951 FA Cup Final and his 45-second opener in the 1955 FA Cup Final which was the fastest ever Wembley FA Cup Final goal until it was beaten by Roberto Di Matteo in 1997, brought him national recognition and afforded him iconic status on Tyneside. In total, Milburn played in three FA Cup winning finals for United; 1951, 1952 and 1955. Despite his achievements, Milburn was reportedly a very shy and self-deprecating individual, whose modesty further endeared him to Newcastle United supporters, though according to Tom Finney, this stemmed from an &quot;innate inferiority complex&quot;.

By the time Milburn left Newcastle in 1957, he had become the highest goalscorer in Newcastle United&#x27;s history. He remained so until he was surpassed by Alan Shearer in February 2006. Milburn remains Newcastle&#x27;s second highest goalscorer, having scored 200 competitive goals. Milburn&#x27;s transfer to Linfield in 1957 was almost jeopardised when the Newcastle board demanded a substantial signing fee, and much to the anger of fans, Milburn was not immediately granted a testimonial. His signing for Linfield &quot;added thousands to the gate&quot; and he made 54 appearances, scoring 68 goals in four seasons in all competitions for the club. He was finally granted a testimonial ten years later, in 1967.

Milburn died of lung cancer on 9 October 1988, aged 64. His funeral took place on 13 October, and was attended by over 1,000 mourners at St Nicholas&#x27;s Cathedral in Newcastle. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to watch the cortège pass. A statue of Milburn, costing £35,000 and paid for by donations received from Newcastle United supporters was erected on Newcastle&#x27;s Northumberland Street before it was relocated in 1999 to St James&#x27; Boulevard and then moved again to its present position on Strawberry Place, just outside St James&#x27; Park.

Milburn was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in October 2006. In 2009, Goal.com listed Milburn as 43rd in their list of the top English players of all time.

== Early life ==
Milburn was born on 11 May 1924 in the upstairs flat of his grandparents&#x27; house at 14 Sixth Row in Ashington to Annie (&quot;Nance&quot;) Thompson and Alexander (&quot;Alec&quot;) Milburn. Alexander Milburn was the uncle of four professional footballing brothers - Jack Milburn (born 1908; played for Leeds United and Bradford City), George Milburn (born 1910; played for Leeds United and Chesterfield), Jimmy Milburn (born 1919; played for Leeds United and Bradford City), and Stan Milburn (born 1926; played for Chesterfield, Leicester City and Rochdale), who were brothers of Jack and Bobby Charlton&#x27;s mother Elizabeth &quot;Cissie&quot; Milburn (born 1912).

Alexander Milburn worked as a coal cutter at the nearby colliery. Jackie Milburn later told his son, Jack Jr., that &quot;I used to shiver as he disappeared into that deep shaft leading to the coalface&quot;. When he was eight years old, Milburn was given his first pair of football boots as a Christmas present from his parents and from that point &quot;football dominated his life&quot;. The young Milburn idolised Joe Hulme, and hoped to emulate him. Although an initially confident boy, Milburn recalled an incident where, having already won the sprint, sprint relay, long jump and high jump at his school sports day, his father arrived just in time to see him win the 440 yard race. Exhausted, he collapsed to the floor – a gesture his father mistook for showboating and resulted in him receiving &quot;a real hiding&quot;. Reflecting later, Milburn contended that &quot;maybe my father&#x27;s intentions were the best in the world...but that thrashing laid the foundations for an inferiority complex I&#x27;ve fought all my life to overcome&quot;. When he was twelve, Milburn moved to Hirst East Senior Boys School and was selected to play right-wing for the school football team. His father promised to award him a penny for every goal he scored. He duly earned two pence for scoring twice on his debut in a 6–4 win against Linton School. He was selected for East Northumberland Schools, and he scored in a 3–2 semi-final defeat by Lancashire at Maine Road.

Milburn left school at fourteen and, telling his father that he was too claustrophobic to follow him into coal-mining, he found employment stacking shelves and filling sugar bags on eight-shillings a week, after an abortive spell as a pantry boy in London. In 1939, he attempted to join the Royal Navy but was rejected for being an inch too short. Milburn joined the Ashington Air Training Corps instead. At sixteen, Milburn accepted an apprenticeship as a fitter at a local colliery. This meant that he was not conscripted during the war as &#x27;fitter&#x27; was a reserved occupation.

Milburn, along with his old schoolfriend Ronnie Coulson, began entering local sprint races to earn money, clocking a 9.7 second personal best for the 100 yard dash. In 1940, he entered the Powderhall Sprint and won his first race. Milburn was then instructed to run poorly in the semi-final so to artificially conflate his handicap in the 1941 renewal, where his odds would be higher and he would be better prepared. Milburn duly came last, allegedly with a dozen pennies weighing down his left running shoe, causing him to &quot;run like a lop-sided whippet with three legs&quot;. Milburn continued to play football for the Air Training Corps and, told one afternoon that a scout from Newcastle United was in attendance, he duly scored five in an 8–3 win. When he was told afterwards that the promised scout had failed to arrive, Milburn described it as &quot;a bitter pill to swallow&quot;.

== Playing career ==

===Newcastle United===

====Trial and signing====
Milburn and his Northumberland ATC teammates were invited to St James&#x27; Park by Newcastle United director Wilf Taylor, after a match against Yorkshire ATC in 1943. Milburn, along with his friend and teammate Raymond Poxton, attended United&#x27;s final home game of the season. Milburn was distinctly unimpressed with what he saw, turning to his friend and saying &quot;Raymond, we could play better than this, surely?&quot; Soon after, he responded to an advertisement for trialists published in the North Mail Newspaper by Newcastle United prior to the 1943–44 season. The first trial was held in midweek and Milburn scored two goals in one half, earning an invitation to return on Saturday for a public trial at St James&#x27; and an &#x27;amateur contract&#x27;. He arrived long before the 2pm kick-off with a pair of borrowed football boots wrapped in brown paper, and his lunch – two pies and a bottle of pop. Milburn&#x27;s team of fellow trialists (&#x27;The Stripes&#x27;) played against a Newcastle United First XI featuring Albert Stubbins and Jimmy Gordon (&#x27;The Blues&#x27;). The Stripes trailed 3–0 at half time and Joe Richardson told Milburn: &quot;you&#x27;d better buck your ideas up son, if you want to come here&quot;. Switched to centre forward in the second half, Milburn scored six times as his side won 9–3. The &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; reported that &quot;United&#x27;s second trial proved a triumph for Milburn, the Ashington inside-left, who was signed as an amateur earlier in the week. Milburn, a tall youth, showed a capacity for opportunism. Twice Milburn scored two goals within a minute&quot;.

Newcastle&#x27;s manager, Stan Seymour, was sufficiently impressed by Milburn&#x27;s performance that, according to author Mike Kirkup, he &quot;asked him to sign on the spot&quot;. Milburn, now 19, had been told by his father not to sign anything until he had first shown it to him and so he refused, instead promising to return in due course with a signed professional contract once his father had approved it. Seymour, apparently concerned that news of Miburn&#x27;s trial performance might alert other clubs, decided not to wait and on the Sunday following the trial he arrived, unannounced, on the Milburns&#x27; doorstep in Ashington. Seymour patiently put his case to Milburn&#x27;s father, Alec, explaining that he would be taken on part-time because of his continuing pit work, on thirty shillings a week, plus two shillings and sixpence a game &quot;for his tea&quot;, and the same amount again for his bus fare to and from the ground. At this point, as Milburn Sr. was considering the terms, Seymour reportedly began rubbing two five pound notes together behind his back. The rustling caught Alec&#x27;s attention and persuaded him to allow Jackie to sign. Seymour, elated, invited everyone to the West End Club for a celebratory drink, later exclaiming that &quot;I had secured my finest ever signing for ten quid and a couple of rounds of Newcastle Brown Ale&quot;. Milburn&#x27;s official registration as a Newcastle United player came on 23 August 1938.

====Debut and wartime football====
In 1943, Newcastle were participants in the Northern First Championship as the Football League had been suspended due to the outbreak of the Second World War. Milburn attended his first training session the day after his signing, and immediately impressed his new teammates by out-sprinting Albert Stubbins in a 100-yard dash. Milburn joined the playing squad for United&#x27;s next match against Bradford City at Valley Parade on 28 August 1943. Seymour invited Milburn&#x27;s father to accompany him and Jackie recalled later that this was &quot;to give me confidence on such a momentous day&quot;. Milburn started at inside-forward in the number 10 shirt and later recalled that this was &quot;the most memorable moment of my career, even those Wembley victories can&#x27;t match it. To pull on the black and white jersey for the first time was something special&quot;. Milburn and United were beaten 2–1, with a nervous Milburn heading wide of an open goal in the early moments. The Bradford goals were both scored by half-back Joe Harvey. Milburn, disappointed to have made little impact, was consoled afterwards by Seymour, who assured him &quot;you&#x27;ll be in the side next week&quot;. A return fixture was played against Bradford City at St James&#x27; Park on 4 September 1943 and Milburn scored his first ever goal for United – with a left-footed strike inside the opening two minutes of a 3–2 win. It was Milburn&#x27;s first touch of the match. Milburn later recalled that &quot;the Sunday papers said it was an excellent goal but...I saw the ball in a cluster of players and dashed up and belted it&quot;. Milburn continued to combine his football career with his work at the colliery. As author Roger Hutchinson later explained: &quot;None of those wartime footballers could be counted as full-time professionals during the war&quot;. By the turn of 1943 he had almost completed his apprenticeship at the colliery and was transferred to Woodhorn Colliery. Milburn used to combine his work at Woodhorn with training on two or occasionally three evenings a week, and there were some instances where Milburn would work a double shift on a Friday, so he would be free to play for United on the following Saturday.

As a player, Milburn continued to develop; football historian Paul Joannou described him as &quot;a raw talent who learned the rudiments of professional football rapidly&quot;. Milburn continued to initially play as an inside forward, on either the left or right flank. In the season 1944–45 United finished 35th of 54 teams in the Wartime League. It was in that season that, due to a player shortage, Milburn made two guest appearances for Newcastle&#x27;s local rivals Sunderland. Milburn failed to score in either game. Milburn also made guest appearances for Sheffield United during the season. For the 1945–46 season Milburn was moved to the right-wing to accommodate new signing Charlie Wayman. Milburn publicly declared that he had no qualms with his move, stating that &quot;I must make it quite clear that for the thirty shillings I receive per match...I consider Newcastle have the right to play me in any position&quot;. Alongside the form of Albert Stubbins, the move lead to a marked increase in United&#x27;s goalscoring potency; in their first game together, Milburn and Wayman combined to help Newcastle beat Middlesbrough 8–2 and other wins included beating Bradford City 11–0 and a 9–1 win over Stoke City at St James&#x27; Park Milburn&#x27;s natural pace was well-suited to his new position – &quot;The Journal&quot;&#x27;s sports correspondent Ken McKenzie reported after one performance that &quot;Milburn&#x27;s speed astonished the crowd&quot;, whilst Joannou later reflected that &quot;his pace always troubled opposing full-backs while he could also hit pinpoint crosses&quot;. Milburn continued to score goals himself and finished the season as United&#x27;s second highest scorer with 14 goals, as Newcastle finished 6th in the Northern War League.

In total, Milburn made 95 appearances for Newcastle United in War League matches, scoring 38 goals. These goals do not count for official purposes as War League matches are designated as friendly matches.

====Cup run and promotion (1946–1948)====
United manager Stan Seymour almost entirely rebuilt his Second Division squad during the war so when United played Barnsley at St James&#x27; Park in the third round of the resumed FA Cup on 5 January 1946, Milburn, Bobby Cowell, Charlie Crowe, Joe Harvey and Charlie Wayman were five of nine players making their competitive debut. 60,284 spectators saw Milburn score twice – his first official goals for the club – in a 4–2 win. However, ties were contested over two legs that season and the return leg saw United beaten 3–0 and 4–5 on aggregate.

Competitive league football re-commenced for the 1946–47 season (although Milburn remained a fitter at Hazelrigg Colliery). United began at Millwall on 31 August 1946. United won 4–1, with Milburn and new signing Roy Bentley (2) scoring their first league goals for the club and another added by Stubbins. That was to prove Stubbins&#x27; last United goal as he was transferred to Liverpool on 12 September for £13,000. Stubbins&#x27; replacement, Len Shackleton, scored six on his debut in a 13–0 win on 5 October at St James&#x27; Park against Newport County. Milburn also scored twice in the match. The winning margin (13) remains a Football League record. With Milburn deployed on the right wing supplying crosses for Shackleton and Wayman, United lost only three league games from the start of the season to Christmas Eve 1946 and led the table. However, three consecutive defeats over the Christmas period checked their momentum and during the extremely harsh winter of 1947 Newcastle&#x27;s form noticeably dipped and they fell out of promotion contention. Attention turned instead to the FA Cup. Milburn had been sidelined through injury until late February 1947 but he returned for the 5th round replay at Leicester City and helped United to a 2–1 win. On 1 March 1947, Milburn, playing at outside right, scored Newcastle&#x27;s second goal in a 2–0 quarter final win at Sheffield United. In the semi-final against Charlton Athletic at Elland Road on 29 March United were beaten 4–0 amid reports of significant pre-match dressing-room acrimony. United eventually finished their league campaign in fifth-place. Milburn, who had played on the right flank for almost the entire season, made 27 appearances in all competitions and scored 8 goals.

The 1947–48 season began with a new manager after George Martin took charge after Seymour stepped down. Hutchinson claimed that: &quot;the pressure on United to get out of Division Two was enormous&quot; but they opened the season with a 6–1 win against Plymouth Argyle, with Milburn scoring. Leading scorer Wayman was sold to Southampton in October, leading to a discussion between Martin, Seymour (now a director), Harvey, trainer Norman Smith and Milburn about his replacement:Martin: &quot;Jackie&#x27;s the man&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Smith: &quot;No, keep him at inside-left or on the wing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Harvey: &quot;Aye, he&#x27;s not good enough in the air for centre-forward&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Milburn (violently shaking his head): &quot;They&#x27;re right. I&#x27;m not cut out to lead the attack. I&#x27;m happy where I am&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Martin: &quot;You&#x27;re wrong, all of you. Jackie will make a centre-forward and will get a cap into the bargain!&quot; Milburn, who later described Martin as &quot;one of the most astute managers I&#x27;ve ever met&quot;, reluctantly accepted the decision and he later admitted that the switch &quot;changed my life&quot;. Despite suffering a sleepless night through nerves, in the very next match against Bury, Milburn scored a hat-trick in a 5–3 win. In his next two games Milburn scored three more goals. By January–1948 Milburn&#x27;s goals had helped Newcastle to second place in the league. According to Hutchinson, Luton Town arrived on 3–January &quot;to face 64,931 fans and a Jackie Milburn blitzkrieg&quot;. Milburn scored a hat-trick, prompting the Sunday Sun to write: &quot;Milburn&#x27;s refreshing pace and enterprise dominated proceedings...his speed and abandon encourage high hopes that he will spearhead United to promotion&quot;. Despite defeat at Charlton Athletic in the FA Cup and the controversial sale of Shackleton to Sunderland in February, a Milburn goal to beat Bury 1–0 in March kept Newcastle in third place. United lost just one game from January to the end of the season, conceding just twice at home in that time, and were promoted in second place with a game to spare. Milburn finished the season as top-scorer with 20 goals in 40 matches.

====Playing in the First Division (1948–1950)====
Prior to the start of the 1948–49 season, Milburn was diagnosed at the Royal Victoria Infirmary with external otitis which prevented him from working underground at Hazelrigg, though he continued surface work. On the pitch, according to Joannou, &quot;Milburn went off like a bomb&quot;. He scored in the first home game of the season, for the fourth season running, in a 2–2 draw with Chelsea on 25 August 1948, and then scored five in his next six league matches. Milburn&#x27;s form was such that he won his first England cap on 9 October. Two weeks later, Milburn put a transfer request to the Newcastle board, stating that: &quot;I need to get away from Tyneside as my wife&#x27;s health is suffering&quot;. The request &quot;sent Tyneside into a panic&quot; but was soon withdrawn after an intervention by Stan Seymour. Milburn later explained that he had been swayed by his international colleagues to believe that &quot;big money could be made...outside of soccer if I moved to another club...on reflection, I realised what a foolish young chap I&#x27;d been&quot;. Meanwhile, United were &quot;enjoying themselves back at the top&quot;; on Christmas Eve 1948, Newcastle led the Division One table by a point. However, despite signing Bobby Mitchell and George Robledo in January 1949 and Milburn&#x27;s continued good form (including a hat-trick at Aston Villa in a 3–2 win), United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Bradford Park Avenue and their title hopes were effectively ended when eventual champions Portsmouth left St James&#x27; Park with a 5–0 win on 6 April. Milburn did not play that match due to international duty. Newcastle eventually finished in 4th place and Milburn top-scored again with 19 goals in all competitions.

In the summer of 1949, Newcastle United embarked upon a tour of the United States. The arrival of United, and Milburn especially, was widely reported; the Winnipeg Free Press reported: &quot;Newcastle United is a magic name, a name forever in lights. Jackie Milburn, a pit electrician and the club&#x27;s present centre-forward, is considered the fastest player in English soccer and is of international class.&quot; Milburn lived up to his reputation; in ten matches played United won all ten and Milburn scored 31 goals. The 1949–50 season started poorly with three straight defeats but as Milburn and Robledo began to develop as a partnership, and Harvey and Brennan returned from injury, form and results began to improve. A Milburn goal, and another from George Hannah on his debut helped beat Manchester City 4–2 at St James&#x27; on 17 September 1949. Despite what Hutchinson described as &quot;some promising wins&quot;, including a 4–2 win over Stoke City and a 5–1 win over West Bromwich Albion, with Milburn scoring three in those games, United were unable to fully recover from their poor start though they finished the season in 5th place without ever seriously threatening to challenge for the league title and their interest in the FA Cup was ended by a 4th round defeat at Chelsea in the 4th round. Milburn was top-scorer once more with 18 league and 1 FA Cup goals and, according to Joannou, &quot;he now had become accustomed to the centre-forward&#x27;s trade, looked the part...and had become the countries new rising star&quot;.

====FA Cup glory (1950–1952)====

Milburn put aside the disappointment of the 1950 World Cup by scoring twice to help beat Stoke City in Newcastle&#x27;s opening game of the 1950–51 season. Milburn&#x27;s goalscoring form, which included a hat-trick in a 6–0 win against Huddersfield Town, helped United to a ten-game unbeaten start to the season and took them to the top the table. They were finally beaten at Villa Park 3–0 on 7 October 1950. Milburn missed the match as he sat at Windsor Park as an unused substitute for England. United recovered with four straight wins but when they travelled to White Hart Lane to face second-placed Tottenham Hotspur on 18 November they were beaten 7–0 and manager Martin resigned. He was immediately replaced by Stan Seymour.

On 13 January 1951, Newcastle, at one stage title favourites, were beaten 3–1 at Stamford Bridge and had fallen to fifth in the league, five points from top spot. They then turned their attentions to the FA Cup. Milburn scored one of the four goals which beat Bury in the 3rd round. Bolton Wanderers, inspired by two assists from Nat Lofthouse, led 2–1 early in the second half of the 4th round tie at St James&#x27;. Milburn settled &quot;a terrific meeting&quot; with two second half goals; the first after a sharp turn and shot from 15 yards and the second saw him beat the offside trap to run clear and score. He was denied a hat-trick when a late header struck the bar and rebounded to safety. A Robledo brace and another goal from Milburn helped beat Stoke City 4–2 in the next round and another Milburn strike helped defeat Bristol Rovers 3–1 in a sixth-round replay. In the semi-final against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 10 March at Hillborough, Milburn had a goal ruled out for offside in a tense 0–0 draw. In the replay four days later at Huddersfield, United recovered from a 1–0 deficit to win 2–1 thanks to another Milburn goal and a winner from Brennan after he was put clear by Milburn. Milburn score six goals up to the final and scored in every round played.

United&#x27;s cup run had coincided with a return to good league form and the press responded to Newcastle&#x27;s semi-final win with speculation of a possible league and cup double; they lay fifth in the table, six points behind leaders Tottenham but with three games in-hand. However, when Seymour told his players in the dressing room after the semi-final win: &quot;whatever happens, you fellows who brought us this far will play at Wembley&quot;, he inadvertently encouraged a malaise which destroyed Newcastle&#x27;s title chances. Milburn later said that &quot;quite unconsciously, every man who is going to play in a great match doesn&#x27;t put everything he possesses into ordinary league games before the great day&quot; and he, Taylor and Harvey were just three of the senior players who found themselves &#x27;rested&#x27; in the games prior to the final as Newcastle &quot;tottered from one defeat to another&quot; to end their title chances.

Newcastle&#x27;s form was so poor that by 28 April 1951, the day of the 1951 FA Cup Final, United had been replaced as favourites by their opponents Blackpool, who finished the season in 3rd place, one place higher than United, in Division One. Blackpool were also the popular choice among the public and press, many of whom had christened the fixture &quot;The Matthews Final&quot; hoping to see 36-year-old Stanley Matthews win the FA Cup for the first time. Milburn, annoyed by Blackpool&#x27;s favoured status, later described his determination &quot;to spoil Matthews&#x27; Wembley party&quot;. In the first half of the match, Milburn had a goal ruled out by referee William Ling for handball. Milburn later argued that &quot;he was wrong – I never touched it!&quot; – a claim vindicated by slow-motion replays. The goalless first half was a &quot;disappointing encounter for the neutral&quot; as Blackpool frustrated United and Milburn with a well-drilled offside trap. However, five minutes into the second half Robledo played a through-ball to Milburn who broke the offside trap, raced clear and sidefooted home to put United 1–0 up. Five minutes later, Milburn scored again. After a passing move on the right wing, the ball was played to Ernie Taylor who immediately back-heeled the ball to Milburn 25 yards from goal who in turn hit a first time, left-footed shot into the top corner of the Blackpool net with such force that he fell over in striking it. Milburn&#x27;s second goal was of such quality that Blackpool forward Stan Mortensen held up the restart for several seconds in order to congratulate the scorer and told him &quot;that&#x27;s just about the greatest goal I&#x27;ve ever seen. It deserves to win the cup&quot;. United held on comfortably to win the match 2–0 and Matthews was in no doubt as to why United had won, telling the press afterwards: It was definitely Milburn&#x27;s match! His terrific speed made the first. The second was right out of the world! It was the greatest goal I have ever seen and certainly the finest scored at Wembley. A goal every player dreams about. Milburn&#x27;s brace took his season&#x27;s FA Cup total to 8 goals in 8 games. He also top-scored in the league with 17 goals.

After a fractious pre-season which saw several players sold, United began the 1951–52 season in very good form despite Milburn missing several matches due to pulled leg muscle. In their first four home matches of the season, United scored 20 goals and conceded three. When fit again, Milburn asked to be selected for the reserves so as to not disturb a winning side, later explaining that &quot;I thought it unfair that the forward line should be changed to accommodate me and Mr. Seymour accepted my request&quot;. Milburn returned to the first-team in time to score in the 1–2 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur in the 1951 FA Charity Shield and by 12 January 1952, Milburn had scored 16 league goals which, along with Robledo&#x27;s 26 goals, meant United were in 4th place in Division One (with a game in hand) and once more tipped among the press for a league and cup double. However, United&#x27;s hopes of retaining the FA Cup almost ended in round three when Aston Villa led 0–2 and 1–3 at St James&#x27; Park. Three goals in the last nine minutes of the match gave Newcastle a 4–2 win.

Prior to Milburn scoring his 100th competitive Newcastle goal in a 1–2 defeat at Burnley on 20 January, Milburn had been linked with a move to league champions Tottenham Hotspur. Milburn afterwards pledged his future to United, telling reporters &quot;I object to these stories that have persistently linked me with other clubs. I have never been happier than I am now with Newcastle United, If I leave Newcastle it will happen because they have kicked me out&quot;. Now four points behind Manchester United in the league but with three games in hand, United travelled to White Hart Lane in the 4th round of the FA Cup and beat the champions 3–0. before winning a 5th round tie at Swansea Town 1–0. In contrast to the previous campaign, Milburn had failed to score in the competition prior to a quarter-final meeting with Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 8 March. In a match described by &quot;The People&quot; as &quot;the cup-tie of the decade&quot;, Milburn scored what author Younger later called &quot;a stunning hat-trick&quot; in helping United to a 4–2 win. In their report the following day, the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; exclaimed; &quot;without exaggerating I should say that Milburn turned in one of the best centre-forward displays of all time&quot;. After a 0–0 draw against Blackburn Rovers in the semi-final at Hillsborough, Milburn provided an assist early in the second half of the replay to help Newcastle to a 2–1 victory and a second successive cup final.

However, progress in the FA Cup triggered another collapse in league form. After the victory against Spurs in the 4th round of the cup, United played 16 further league games and accumulated 11 points; &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reporter Arthur Appleton recalled that: &quot;The BBC asked me to record the sound of a Newcastle goal being acclaimed by the crowd. I followed them from match to match and they never scored a goal; they were keeping themselves for Wembley.&quot; United eventually finished in 8th place, 12 points behind champions Manchester United. On 3 May 1952, Newcastle and Milburn travelled to Wembley to play Arsenal in the FA Cup final. In the 24th minute, Arsenal right back Wally Barnes suffered a serious injury after his studs were caught in the Wembley turf. As substitutes were not permitted, the injury meant Arsenal had to play with ten men for the rest of the match. Milburn had a quiet match, though he almost scored with a header which was cleared off the goal line, a goal from Robledo five minutes from time meant Newcastle became the first team in the 20th century to retain the cup.

Milburn scored 25 league goals during the season and was the second highest scorer at the club behind George Robledo.

====Transition and a third cup win: 1952–1955====
Milburn joined his teammates on a tour of South Africa in the summer of 1952, but suffered a series of niggling injuries which limited his appearances to just five of the seventeen games United played, and he also missed the 2–4 defeat to Manchester United in the 1952 FA Charity Shield. Injuries continued to limit his appearances – he didn&#x27;t score a goal until he converted a penalty in a 2–0 win over Manchester City on 27 September 1952.

===Later career===
In June 1957, Milburn left the &quot;Magpies&quot; to join Belfast club Linfield as player-manager at Windsor Park, where he won 9 trophies (including an Irish League title and Irish Cup win), and finished as the league&#x27;s top goalscorer in both the 1957–58 and 1958–59 seasons to become the first non-Irishman to become the Irish League&#x27;s top scorer. When he left Linfield, he dropped down to non-league level, and played for Southern Football League Division One club Yiewsley for two seasons.

After retiring as a player, he went on to briefly manage Ipswich Town, before returning to Tyneside to become a sports journalist for the &quot;News of the World&quot;. According to author Dylan Younger, he also acted as &#x27;an unofficial advisor to Newcastle managers&#x27;, including forming a close relationship with former teammate Joe Harvey. He would work for the &quot;News of the World&quot; for the next 23 years.

In 1967, he was given a belated testimonial match by Newcastle. Milburn had worried that ten years after leaving the club, people would have forgotten, but he needn&#x27;t have worried, as almost 50,000 turned out at St. James&#x27; Park for the match. It featured a host of stars including his cousins, the famous World Cup winning brothers, Jack and Bobby Charlton, and the great Hungarian player Ferenc Puskás.

In 1980, Milburn was the first footballer to be made a Freeman of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne – an honour later also bestowed on former opponent Bobby Robson, and the man who surpassed his Newcastle United goalscoring records, Alan Shearer. He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981, when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the studios of Tyne Tees Television in Newcastle.

== Legacy ==

In 1987, Newcastle United opened their new West Stand at St James&#x27; Park. This was named the &quot;Milburn Stand&quot;, in honour of Jackie.This remains the only stand named after a player at St James&#x27; Park.

Three statues of Milburn were commissioned. One was placed in Station Road in his birthplace Ashington. The funds were raised by the Civic Head, Cllr. Michael George Ferrigon during his term of Office. It now stands at Ashington Leisure Centre in Lintonville Terrace. A second statue of Milburn was unveiled by Laura Milburn on Newcastle&#x27;s Northumberland Street in 1991. It was designed by sculptor Susanna Robinson and cost £35,000. The fee was raised after an appeal by the local newspaper attracted donations from local businesses and Newcastle United supporters. The statue stands high and the inscription reads: &quot;John Edward Thompson Milburn, footballer and gentleman&quot;. It was relocated in 1999 to St James&#x27; Boulevard, and then moved again to its present position on Strawberry Place, just outside St James&#x27; Park.

The whereabouts of the third statue had caused some local consternation in 2011, when the local newspaper recounted a fibreglass statue of Milburn located outside St James&#x27; Park between 1996 and 1998, but which had since vanished. The statue was &#x27;found&#x27; in the garden of the sculptor who had created it, Tom Maley, who had held it after it was returned to him by Newcastle United to cast in bronze – an arrangement which was cancelled when the club was sold to Mike Ashley in 2007.

In 1987, Milburn was voted the &#x27;greatest post-war North East footballer&#x27; by the local press. In 1991, a steam locomotive which had previously hauled coal at Ashington Colliery where Milburn had worked was renamed &quot;Jackie Milburn&quot; in his honour. After a fundraising initiative launched in 2006, by Jack Milburn Jr to restore the locomotive, it was displayed in Milburn&#x27;s hometown again in 2011. In 2006, Milburn was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his contribution to English football. In 2008, Excelsior Academy School in Newcastle&#x27;s West End was assigned the official name &#x27;Milburn School of Sport and Health-related Studies&#x27;. In 2009, Goal.com listed Milburn 43rd in their list of the &#x27;top English players of all time&#x27;. A feature in the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Linfield, listed Milburn as the second greatest player to have ever represented the club. In 2012, a survey by the &quot;Evening Chronicle&quot; placed Milburn first, ahead of Bobby Robson and Catherine Cookson, in their list of &#x27;100 Greatest Geordies&#x27;. Sport Newcastle&#x27;s &#x27;Young Talent&#x27; award is entitled the Wor Jackie Award in honour of Milburn.

He was also the subject of a 53-minute documentary, &quot;A Tribute to Jackie Milburn: Tyneside&#x27;s Favourite Son&quot;, produced by Tyne Tees Television, and later released in 1989 by Video Gems on VHS. It covered his life, times, and career with Newcastle United.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Milburn was staying at a Letchworth hotel with his Newcastle teammates, when he met Laura Blackwood – a silver-service waitress working at the hotel. According to Blackwood, she was serving him breakfast when he &#x27;asked her out&#x27; and they went to the cinema. Three months later, she travelled to the family home in Ashington and Milburn proposed. They married on 16 February 1948 at Willesden Register Office in North London. They had three children – Linda, Betty and Jackie Jr – and six grandchildren.

<doc id="673009" wikidata="Q478445" url="?curid=673009" title="Pont-Farcy">
<text>Pont-Farcy () is a former commune in the Manche department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. Before 1 January 2018, it was part of the Calvados department. On 1 January 2018, it was merged into the commune of Tessy-Bocage.

==History==
Pont-Farcy has its origins in Gallo-Roman times: the town has always been an important crossing place due to its bridge over the River Vire. It was also passed through by the Dukes of Normandy. It is likely that some of the families who settled in Cheshire after 1066 came from the area. Before the 20th century, there is little evidence to suggest the village held much more than peasants; it probably wasn&#x27;t considered a particularly important spot, as Saint-Sever-Calvados was. During the 20th century, the village became a thriving river port, and a tow path for barges starts here and reaches as far as the Baie de Seine and the Normandy landing beaches. The village originally had a railway bridge over the Vire, but this was blown up by the Nazis upon their retreat from the village in 1944. Pont-Farcy was liberated by the American 35th Infantry Division on 2 August 1944.

In the latter half of the 20th century the population has dropped from nearly 1,000 to about 500, although in recent years it has grown slightly. This has a lot to do with the Autoroute which passes just north of the village.

==Population==
Its inhabitants are known as &quot;Farcy-Pontains&quot;.

==Geography==
The village is located on the D307a road, and the nearest sizable villages are Villedieu-les-Poêles to the southwest, Saint-Martin-des-Besaces to the northeast, Tessy-sur-Vire and Saint-Lô to the north, and Sainte-Marie-Outre-l&#x27;Eau, Beaumesnil and Vire to the south.

Pont-Farcy is a small rural village, surrounded by many small hamlets (some of which are no more than a single farm); sizable settlements neighbouring Pont-Farcy are named above. Pont-Farcy has a petrol station, a bar and newsagents, a hotel and restaurant called &quot;Le Coq Hardi&quot;, a church with graveyard and a separate cemetery, the latter of which practices the French custom of naming the living on the tombstones (leaving the year of death blank). There is also a campsite along the banks of the River Vire, with an outdoor pursuits centre from which bikes and canoes can be hired.

==Personalities==
One of the village&#x27;s most famous residents is the Russian-born artist Timur D&#x27;Vatz, who is currently exhibiting in London, Venice, New York City and Paris.

<text>Pont-l&#x27;Évêque () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It is known for Pont-l&#x27;Évêque cheese, a type of soft cheese, the oldest Normandy cheese in production.

==History==
In the summer of 1793, in the wake of the Montagnard seizure of power, the town called on neighboring villages to rise up against those who had imprisoned &quot;the most ardent defenders of true liberty&quot;. The also blamed the Montagnard for the September massacres of the privious year.

During World War II, the town was severely damaged by a two-day battle in August 1944. On 1 January 2019, the former commune of Coudray-Rabut was merged into Pont-l&#x27;Évêque.

The town serves as the setting for Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s story &quot;Un cœur simple&quot; and features heavily in the book &quot;13 - Lucky For Some&quot; which is about the history of the 13th (Lancashire) Parachute Battalion. There are many then and now photographs as well as maps and diagrams of battles that took place in the region.

==Geography and toponymy==
The river Touques flows through Pont-l&#x27;Évêque, which takes its name from a bridge (&quot;pont&quot;) built over the river. Starting in the 10th century, the local bishop (&quot;évêque&quot;) took responsibility for building and repairing the bridges and roads in France. Pont-l&#x27;Évêque thus means &quot;Bishop Bridge&quot;. It was Latinised as &quot;Pons-Episcopi&quot;. Pont-l&#x27;Évêque station has rail connections to Paris, Deauville, Évreux and Lisieux.

<text>A dollhouse or doll&#x27;s house is a toy house made in miniature. Since the early 20th century dollhouses have primarily been the domain of children, but their collection and crafting is also a hobby for many adults. English-speakers in North America commonly use the term &quot;dollhouse&quot;, but in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries the term is &quot;doll&#x27;s house&quot; (or, less commonly, &quot;dolls&#x27; house&quot;). They are often built to put dolls in.

The history of today&#x27;s dollhouses can be traced back about four hundred years to the &quot;baby house&quot; display cases of Europe, which showed idealized interiors. Smaller dollhouses with more realistic exteriors appeared in Europe in the 18th century. Early dollhouses were all handmade, but following the Industrial Revolution and World War II, they were increasingly mass-produced and became more standardized and affordable. Dollhouses can range from simple boxes stacked together used as rooms for play, to multi-million dollar structures displayed in museums.

Contemporary children&#x27;s play dollhouses are mostly on a 1:18 (or 2/3&quot;) scale, while a 1:12 (or 1&quot;) scale is common for dollhouses made for adult collectors.

==History==

Miniature homes, furnished with domestic articles and resident inhabitants, both people and animals, have been made for thousands of years. The earliest known examples were found in the Egyptian tombs of the Old Kingdom, created nearly five thousand years ago. These wooden models of servants, furnishings, boats, livestock and pets placed in the Pyramids almost certainly were made for religious purposes.

The earliest known European dollhouses were the &quot;baby houses&quot; from the 16th century, which consisted of cabinet display cases made up of individual rooms. The term “baby” in baby house is coined from the old English word meaning doll. Dollhouses of this period showed idealized interiors complete with detailed furnishings and accessories. The cabinets were built by hand with architectural details, filled with miniature household items and were solely intended for adults. The baby moniker referred to the scale of the houses rather than the demographic it was aimed at. They were off-limits to children, not because of safety concerns for the child but to protect the dollhouse. Such cabinet houses were trophy collections owned by the few matrons living in the cities of Holland, England and Germany who were wealthy enough to afford them and, fully furnished, were worth the price of a modest full-size house&#x27;s construction.

The earliest known recorded baby house was commissioned from 1557-1558 by Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria.  

Smaller doll houses, such as the Tate house with more realistic exteriors, appeared in Europe in the 18th century. Nuremberg kitchens, a type of single-room dollhouse, date back at least to 1572, when one was given to Dorothea and Anna, the Princesses of Saxony, daughters of Augustus, Elector of Saxony aged five and ten.

The early European dollhouses were each unique, constructed on a custom basis by individual craftsmen. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, factories began mass producing toys, including dollhouses and miniatures suitable for furnishing them. German companies noted for their dollhouses included Christian Hacker, Moritz Gottschalk, Elastolin, and Moritz Reichel. The list of important English companies includes Silber &amp; Fleming, Evans &amp; Cartwright, and Lines Brothers (which became Tri-ang). By the end of the 19th century American dollhouses were being made in the United States by The Bliss Manufacturing Company. In France, the Deauville dollhouses were made by the manufacturer Villard &amp; Weill in the first quarter of the 20th century.

Germany produced the most prized dollhouses and doll house miniatures up until World War I. The doll houses were produced in Nuremberg, Germany; which, since the sixteenth century, was coined as the &#x27;toy city&#x27;. Their baby houses were thought to be the origin for the basic standards of contemporary doll houses. Notable German miniature companies included Märklin, Rock and Graner and others. Their products were not only avidly collected in Central Europe, but regularly exported to Britain and North America. Germany&#x27;s involvement in WWI seriously impeded both production and export. New manufacturers arose in other countries.

France produced the dollhouses known as Deauville Dollhouses. They were made by the VILLARD &amp; WEILL company, mainly between 1905 and 1925. This toys manufacturer won prizes in Sydney, Paris and St Louis World Fairs.

The TynieToy Company of Providence, Rhode Island, made authentic replicas of American antique houses and furniture in a uniform scale beginning in about 1917. Other American companies of the early 20th century were Roger Williams Toys, Tootsietoy, Schoenhut, and the Wisconsin Toy Co. Dollhouse dolls and miniatures were also produced in Japan, mostly by copying original German designs.

After World War II, dollshouses were mass-produced in factories on a much larger scale with less detailed craftsmanship than before. By the 1950s, the typical dollhouse sold commercially was made of painted sheet metal filled with plastic furniture. Such houses cost little enough that the great majority of girls from the developed western countries which were not struggling with rebuilding after World War II could own one.

==Standard scales==

The baby houses of the 17th and 18th centuries, and the toy dollhouses of the 19th and early 20th century rarely had uniform scales, even for the features or contents of any individual house. Although a number of manufacturers made lines of miniature toy furniture in the 19th century, the products were not made to a strict scale.

Children&#x27;s play dollhouses from most of the 20th and 21st centuries are 1:18 or two third inch scale (where 1 foot is represented by 2/3 of an inch). Common brands include Lundby (Sweden), Renwal, Plasco, Marx, Petite Princess, and T. Cohn (all American) and Caroline&#x27;s Home, Barton, Dol-Toi and Tri-ang (English). A few brands use 1:16 or 3/4&quot;-scale.

The most common standard for adult collectors is 1:12 scale, also called 1&quot; or one inch scale (where 1 foot is represented by 1 inch.) Among adult collectors there are also smaller scales which are much more common in the United States than in Britain. 1:24 or half inch scale (1 foot is 1/2&quot;) was popular in Marx dollhouses in the 1950s but only became widely available in collectible houses after 2002, about the same time that even smaller scales became more popular, like 1:48 or quarter inch scale (1 foot is 1/4&quot;) and 1:144 or &quot;dollhouse for a dollhouse&quot; scale. 1/24th scale dolls houses, and those in smaller scales, may be considered as just one species of miniature houses of this size. 1/24th (or the almost indistinguishable 1/25th) is used for a variety of models including display models and what are coming to be known as &#x27;house portraits&#x27;. These typically focus on the exterior detail rather than the rooms inside, though there is no reason why a dolls house should not have a realistic exterior or a house portrait include interior details.

In Germany during the middle part of the 20th century 1:10 scale became popular based on the metric system. Dollhouses coming out of Germany today remain closer in scale to 1:10 than 1:12.

The largest common size for dollhouses is 1:6 which is proportionate for Barbie, Ken, Blythe and other dolls 11-12 inches tall, and furniture and accessories such as Re-Ment.

==Construction==

In the United States, most houses have an open back and a fancy facade, while British houses are more likely to have a hinged front that opens to reveal the rooms.

Children&#x27;s dollhouses during the 20th century have been made from a variety of materials, including metal (tin litho), fibreboard, plastic, and wood. With the exception of Lundby, 1:18 scale furniture for children&#x27;s dollhouses has most often been made of plastic.

Contemporary kit and fully built houses are typically made of plywood or medium-density fiberboard (MDF). Tab-and-slot kits use a thinner plywood and are held together by a system of tabs and slots (plus glue). These houses are usually light-weight and lower cost but often require siding, shingles, or other exterior treatments to look realistic. Kits made from heavier plywood or MDF are held together with nails and glue.

==As a hobby==

The dolls house hobby has two main focuses: construction and/or purchase of dolls houses made by or for adult enthusiasts, and collection of contemporary, vintage or antique dolls houses which were often originally made for children.

=== Dolls houses made by or for adult enthusiasts ===
Dollhouses for hobbyists and collectors are available in different forms, from ready made and decorated houses to kits to custom built houses made to the customer&#x27;s design. Some design and build their own dollhouse. Simpler designs might consist of boxes stacked together and used as rooms. Miniature objects used for decoration inside dollhouses include furniture, interior decorations, dolls and items like books, couches, furniture, wallpaper, and even clocks. Some include functional kitchen appliances to create miniature food. Dollhouses for enthusiasts are available ready made and in kits, but may also be homemade.

Dozens of miniature trade shows are held by various miniature organizations and enthusiasts throughout the year, where artisans and dealers display and sell miniatures. Often, how-to seminars and workshops are part of the show features. Stores that sell miniatures also hold classes. Enthusiasts share images online and use Internet forums, blogs and other online social media to share information about dollhouses and miniatures.

=== Collection of vintage or antique dolls houses ===
Recognition of the value and enjoyment of collecting vintage and antique dolls houses as a hobby is due largely to the publications of two experts, Vivien Greene (1904-2003) in the UK, and Flora Gill Jacobs (1918-2006) in the US. Vivien Greene&#x27;s first book, &quot;English Dolls&#x27; Houses of the 18th and 19th Centuries&quot;, was published in 1955; in the same year, an exhibition of period dolls houses from several countries was held in London. Flora Gill Jacobs&#x27; first book, &quot;A History of Dolls’ Houses&quot;, was published in 1953. Both collectors opened museums dedicated to dolls houses, the Rotunda (1962-1998) in Oxford, England, and the Washington Dolls’ House &amp; Toy Museum (1975-2004), in Washington D.C., US.

Through print publications such as the &quot;International Dolls&#x27; House News&quot; (c 1969-2002) &quot;American Miniaturist&quot;, and &quot;Dolls House and Miniature Scene&quot;, collectors around the world shared photos, tips, queries and information; today, websites, blogs, social media, and online forums allow even more collectors to share their hobby.

==Notable dollhouses==
Anna Köferlin’s (no longer existing) Nuremberg doll house was commissioned in 1631 and was publicly displayed and advertised by Köferlin in the form of original verses composed on broadsheet.

 Surviving Dutch 17th century notable cabinet dollhouses include the Amsterdam, Netherlands 18th century dollhouses of Sara Rothé; one is in the Frans Hals Museum, and one is in the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag; the dollhouse of Petronella de la Court in Centraal Museum, and the dollhouse of Petronella Oortman in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. The Rijksmuseum estimates that Petronella Oortman spent twenty to thirty thousand guilders on her miniature house, which was nearly the price of a real house along one of Amsterdam&#x27;s canals at that time. All these dollhouses shows the linen room (laundry room), kitchen, and bedrooms in great detail.

In Tampere in Finland, the Moomin Museum displays the &quot;Moomin house&quot;, a dollhouse created around the Moomin characters of Tove Jansson. The house was built by Jansson, Tuulikki Pietilä and Pentti Eistola and later donated to the town of Tampere. The museum also contains dozens of roomboxes with Moomin characters, all made by Tuulikki Pietilä. The Dollhouse Museum () in Basel, Switzerland is the largest museum of its kind in Europe.

In Russia, the most famous was made for (1830s, now in the collection of National Pushkin Museum).
In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Uppark Baby-house&quot; (ca. 1730) is on exhibit at Uppark, West Sussex, owned by The National Trust. The &quot;Nostell Priory Baby-house&quot; (ca. 1730) is on exhibit at Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, also owned by The National Trust. &quot;The Tate House&quot; (1760) is on exhibit in the Museum of Childhood in London, England.
Queen Mary&#x27;s Dolls&#x27; House was designed for Queen Mary in 1924 by Sir Edwin Lutyens, a leading architect of the time, and is on display at Windsor Castle. When first put on display it was visited by 1.6 million people in seven months. It is approximately 5&#x27; tall, contains 16 rooms, and required 4 years to construct. The dollhouse has working plumbing and lights and is filled with miniature items of the finest and most modern goods of the period. Writers like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling contributed special books which were written and bound in scale size.

Titania&#x27;s Palace is on display in Egeskov Castle in Denmark, a miniature castle that was hand-built by James Hicks &amp; Sons, Irish Cabinet Makers who were commissioned by Sir Neville Wilkinson from 1907 to 1922. The palace is 4&#x27; 1&quot; tall, contains 18 rooms, and required 15 years to construct. It was built in Ireland but was won by Denmark in a bidding war in 1978 at Sotheby&#x27;s London Auction house. &quot;Tara&#x27;s Palace&quot; is located in the Tara&#x27;s Palace Museum of Childhood in the grounds of Powerscourt Estate near Enniskerry, Ireland. It required 10 years to build, is 4&#x27;6&quot; in height, contains 22 rooms, and was built by Ron McDonnell beginning in 1978 after he failed to secure the return of Titania&#x27;s Palace to Ireland. It is furnished with miniature antiques.

The Stettheimer Dollhouse was constructed in New York City by Carrie Walter Stettheimer between 1916 and 1935. Many contemporary artists made miniatures of their art for the dollhouse, including Marcel Duchamp, Alexander Archipenko, George Bellows, Gaston Lachaise, and Marguerite Zorach. It is 28&quot; high and contains 12 rooms, and is now located at the Museum of the City of New York. The 68 miniature &quot;Thorne Rooms&quot; room boxes, each with a different theme, were designed by Narcissa Niblack Thorne and furniture for them was created by craftsmen in the 1930s and 40s. They are now at the Art Institute of Chicago, Phoenix Art Museum and the Knoxville Museum of Art in Knoxville, Tennessee.

American silent film actress Colleen Moore&#x27;s dollhouse is called the &quot;Fairy Castle&quot;. It is 7&#x27; tall, has twelve rooms, and required 7 years to construct, beginning in 1928. In 2012 dollars, the fairy Castle would cost $7 million and when first put on tour it generated $9 million in revenue over a four-year period. It has been on display since the 1950s at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, Illinois and is visited by an estimated 1.5 million people each year.

The Astolat Dollhouse Castle was inspired by Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s poetry about the Lady of the Lake and built between 1974 and 1987 by miniaturist Elaine Diehl. It was appraised over $7 million in 2006 and at $8.5 million in 2015 primarily because of the upgrade to the interiors and pieces. It is 9&#x27; tall, has 29 rooms and is on display at the Nassau County Museum of Art on Long Island, New York. The Colleen Moore fairy Castle Dollhouse and the Astolat Dollhouse Castle were designed with fixed contiguous exterior walls to create a three-dimensional viewing effect.

== Women and doll houses ==
As interest in doll houses expanded during the seventeenth century, there was also a shift in the gender-oriented organization of the miniature houses towards a more feminine focus. There is a shift of viewing doll houses as a collectible “male-oriented artefact to a female-organized model of domesticity”. Dutch doll houses resembled cabinets with separate compartments of fully furnished rooms than actual houses, which represented the domestic household, “through the inclusion of amply-stocked linen rooms and kitchens”.

<doc id="673013" wikidata="Q3248550" url="?curid=673013" title="Count of Tripoli">
<text>The count of Tripoli was the ruler of the County of Tripoli, a crusader state from 1102 through to 1289. Of the four major crusader states in the Levant, Tripoli was created last.

The history of the counts of Tripoli began with Raymond IV of Toulouse, who led the Siege of Tripoli. The first count was his son Bertrand, who pushed his claim over that of his cousin William II Jordan of Berga and Cerdenya. After the death of Raymond III shortly after the Battle of Hattin, the title of count of Tripoli was passed to the princes of Antioch until the fall of the city in 1289.

Count Raymond IV of Toulouse, one of the leaders of the First Crusade, founded the county in 1102 during a lengthy war with the Banu Ammar emirs of Tripoli (theoretically vassals of the Fatimid caliphs in Cairo). The county gradually grew as the crusaders seized much of their territory and besieged Banu Ammar within Tripoli itself. Raymond died in 1105, leaving his infant son Alfonso-Jordan as his heir, with a cousin, William-Jordan of Cerdenya, as regent. William-Jordan continued the siege of Tripoli until 1109, when the elder son of Raymond, Bertrand arrived in the east, leaving Toulouse to Alfonso-Jordan and his mother, who returned to France. Bertrand and William-Jordan, with mediation from King Baldwin I of Jerusalem, came to an agreement whereby each would keep control of their own conquests. Bertrand captured Tripoli later that year. When William-Jordan died a few months later Bertrand became sole ruler.

The county of Tripoli continued to exist as a vassal state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Count Raymond III, who reigned from 1152 to 1187, was an important figure in the history of the Kingdom to the south due to his close relationship to its kings (his mother Hodierna was a daughter of Baldwin II of Jerusalem) and to his own position as Prince of Galilee through his wife. He acted twice as Regent for the kingdom, first for the young Baldwin IV from 1174 to 1177, and then again for Baldwin V from 1185 to 1186. He also acted as the leader of the local nobility in their opposition to Baldwin IV&#x27;s Courtenay relations with the Knights Templar, Guy of Lusignan, and Reynald of Châtillon. Raymond unsuccessfully argued in favor of peace with Saladin, but, ironically, it was Saladin&#x27;s siege of Raymond&#x27;s Countess in Tiberias that led the Crusader army into Galilee before its defeat at Hattin in 1187. Although Raymond survived the battle, he died soon afterward.

Despite the Muslim leader&#x27;s string of victories, the county avoided being conquered by Saladin. Bohemond IV, second son of Bohemond III of Antioch, succeeded to the Countship upon Raymond&#x27;s death. After Bohemond III died in 1201, the county was in personal union with Antioch for all but three years (1216–1219) until Antioch&#x27;s fall to the Mamluks in 1268. Tripoli survived for a few more years.

The death of the unpopular Count Bohemond VII in 1287 led to a dispute between his heir, his sister Lucia, and the city&#x27;s commune, which put itself under the protection of the Genoese. Eventually, Lucia came to an agreement with the Genoese and the Commune, which displeased the Venetians and the ambitious Bartholomew Embriaco, the Genoese mayor of the city, who called in the Mameluke Sultan Qalawun to their aid. Qalawun razed the city after a siege in 1289, bringing the history of the county to an end.

<doc id="673014" wikidata="Q756868" url="?curid=673014" title="Bali myna">
<text>The Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi), also known as Rothschild&#x27;s mynah, Bali starling, or Bali mynah, locally known as jalak Bali, is a medium-sized (up to long), stocky myna, almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, and black tips on the wings and tail. The bird has blue bare skin around the eyes, greyish legs and a yellow bill. Both sexes are similar. It is critically endangered and in 2020, fewer than 50 adults were assumed to exist in the wild.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The Bali myna was formally described in 1912 by the German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann based on a female specimen collected on the island of Bali in Indonesia. He introduced a new genus &quot;Leucopsar&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Leucopsar rothschildi&quot;. The genus name combines the Ancient greek &quot;leukos&quot; meaning &quot;white&quot; with &quot;psar&quot; meaning &quot;starling&quot;. The specific epithet was chosen to honour Walter Rothschild who had allowed Stresemann to examine birds at his museum in Tring, Hertfordshire, England.
The Bali myna remains the only species placed in the genus &quot;Leucopsar&quot;. It appears to be most closely related to &quot;Sturnia&quot; and the brahminy starling which was initially placed in &quot;Sturnus&quot; then later moved by a study in 2008 to &quot;Sturnia&quot;, as &quot;Sturnus&quot; as delimited was highly paraphyletic.

==Description==
The Bali myna is a medium-large starling around in length. It is almost wholly white with a long, drooping crest, black wing-tips and tail tip. It has a yellow bill with blue bare skin around the eyes and legs. The sexes are similar in appearance but the male has a longer crest than the female. The black-winged myna (&quot;Acridotheres melanopterus&quot;), a similar species, has a shorter crest and a much larger area of black on wings and tail, plus a yellow eye-ring (without feathers) and legs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Bali myna is restricted to the northwest Bali (and its offshore islands) in Indonesia, where it is the island&#x27;s only endemic vertebrate species. In 1991, the bird was designated the faunal emblem of Bali. Featured on the Indonesian 200 rupiah coin, its local name is &quot;jalak Bali&quot; (Balinese script: ᬚᬮᬓ᭄ᬩᬮᬶ).

==Behaviour and ecology==

In its natural habitat it is inconspicuous, using tree tops for cover and–unlike other starlings–usually coming to the ground only to drink or to find nesting materials; this would seem to be an adaptation to its noticeability to predators when out in the open. The Bali mynah often gathers in groups when it is young to better locate food and watch out for predators. The vocalizations are a variety of sharp chattering calls and an emphatic tweet.

The Bali myna&#x27;s diet includes fruit, seeds, worms and insects.

===Breeding===
During the breeding season (the rainy season of Bali), males attract female by calling loudly and bobbing up and down. The birds nest in tree cavities, with the female laying and incubating two or three eggs. Both males and females bring food to the nest for chicks after hatching.

==Status and conservation==
The Bali myna is critically endangered, and the wild population has been close to extinction since at least 1994. As of 2015, less than 100 adults are assumed to exist in the wild, with about 1,000 believed to survive in captivity. The Bali myna is listed in Appendix I of CITES. Trade even in captive-bred specimens is strictly regulated and the species is not generally available legally to private individuals. However, experienced aviculturalists may become affiliated with captive-breeding programs, allowing them to legally keep this species. The number of captive birds bought on the black market is estimated to be twice the number of legally acquired individuals in the captive breeding programs.

In 2018, there were three locations on Bali where the birds existed in the wild: the West Bali National Park; Bali&#x27;s small island of Nusa Penida and Begawan Foundation&#x27;s breeding and release site at Melinggih Kelod, Payangan.

===Bali myna breeding program===
A &quot;breeding loan&quot; involves 12 breeders who each received 15 male and 15 female myna birds from the Association of Starling Conservationists in Bogor, West Java. As collateral every breeder must put up a cow in case all the birds died. The breeders are obliged to release 10 percent of the brood into West Bali National Park and the rest can be sold off privately.
There is one pair of Bali Mynas at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that are part of the Species Survival Program.

===West Bali National Park===

There were an estimated 350 birds in the West Bali National Park in the 1980s. During the 1990s over 400 cage-bred birds were released into the park to increase their numbers. But by 2005, the park authorities estimated the number to have fallen to less than 10. This decline was caused primarily by poachers responding to the lucrative demand for rare birds in the caged bird market.

===Nusa Penida island===

A population of Bali mynas now exists on the island of Nusa Penida and its sister islands of Nusa Ceningan, Nusa Lembongan, which are 14 km off the south east coast of Bali. The islands have been transformed into an unofficial bird sanctuary by
Friends of National Parks Foundation (FNPF), an Indonesian NGO based in Bali. This was achieved by FNPF working for many years with the 40+ villages on the islands and persuading every village to pass a traditional Balinese village regulation to protect birds, and effectively removing the threat of poachers. Since then, FNPF has rehabilitated and released several endangered birds onto the island of Nusa Penida, including many Bali mynas supplied from multiple breeders.

The Begawan Foundation began its Bali Starling Breeding Program in Begawan Giri in 1999 with two pairs, which had grown to a population of 97 in 2005. A release program was started on Nusa Penida, where 64 individuals were released in 2006 and 2007. Monitoring of the released birds suggests that their numbers had increased to +100 by 2009, and had spread across Penida, with small numbers also breeding on Ceningan and Lembongan. A number of further captive-bred individuals have since been rewilded, including 6 individuals on neighboring Nusa Lembongan. The foundation expects to release approximately 10 Bali mynas each year. The birds will continue to be sourced from different breeders to increase the genetic diversity of the growing wild population on Nusa Penida. Begawan Foundation field staff have monitored the released birds on a daily basis since their release and have a dedicated Field Officer since 2010. Findings are regularly reported to the Forestry Department, with photos and films taken of the birds&#x27; activities.

However, according to an audit undertaken by Begawan Foundation on both Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan in February and March 2015, less than 15 birds were seen to be flying in the wild. Calculations undertaken suggest that by 2015, even taking natural predation and death of older birds into account, there should be at least 200 birds flying on Nusa Penida today, indicating that illegal wildlife trade is heavily impacting the population.

===Sibang, Central Bali===

In 2010, Begawan Foundation made a decision to move all its captive breeding Bali starlings from Nusa Penida to a new site at Sibang, near Ubud. The breeding program then recommenced with the aim to research new release sites close by. During 2011, a total of 23 Bali starlings were donated to BF&#x27;s breeding program. Three birds were donated by Jurong Bird Park, and 20 came from a variety of zoos across Europe, members of the European Endangered Species Program, whose contributions of birds meant that new genetic lines would be introduced when the imported birds were paired with the local birds held at the breeding centre in Bali.

In November 2012, Begawan Foundation released four pairs of Bali starlings at its breeding site in Sibang. These birds were observed and their daily habits recorded by staff of the Foundation and students of the adjacent Green School. A program of conservation was undertaken with the local villages prior to the release and has the full support of the King of Sibang. Each bird has been ringed in order to identify it as it adapts to life in the wild. As this was a soft release, the birds often take the opportunity to return to the breeding site to find food and water. However, it is evident that new sources of fruit and a variety of insects are available in the immediate vicinity that provide a full and healthy diet for these birds and their offspring.

In 2014, there were three releases by Begawan Foundation at their site in Sibang. Three male birds and one female were released in April, with support from the local community. In June, Dr. Jane Goodall, during her visit to Bali, assisted in the release of two Bali starlings.

=== Melinggih Kelod, Payangan ===
In late 2017, Begawan Foundation decided to concentrate its programs in Mellingih kelod, Payangan, north of Ubud. A community-based conservation program began in the village in late 2017, providing local residents with the opportunity to breed Bali Starlings, and to be able to release F2 generation offspring within two years, and again in subsequent years. It is also envisaged that the community will be responsible for the safety of the Bali Starlings in the wild through serious monitoring and village traditional law enforcement. The Village officiated an &quot;awik-awik&quot; (local law) in November 2018, which has been signed by the Village Head as well as the Kelians (heads) of the banjars (village sections). The local law states that shooting/trapping/hunting the Bali Starling or any other protected wildlife in the area is prohibited. Any person from the community that is caught doing any of the above will pay a penalty of Rp10,000,000.
The Foundation also released a number of Starlings in late 2018, creating a wild flock of Bali Starlings in the Village, which is protected by the community. It is hoped that the soft releases will give the offspring the chance to reproduce in the wild and that a program of eco-tourism can be developed to provide income for the village.
Along with the community-based conservation program in Melinggih Kelod Village, the Foundation&#x27;s Breeding and Release Centre has been relocated and is now centred in Banjar Begawan, one of the districts in the Village. This centre is open to the local community and the general public.

<text>The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player (MVP) is an annual Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) award given since the league&#x27;s inaugural season in 1997. MVP voting takes place immediately following the regular season. The award recipient is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States. Panel members were asked to select their top five choices for the award, with 10 points being awarded for a first place vote, seven for second, five for third, three for fourth and one for fifth.

In 2008, fans could also have a say in who won the award. Fans were able to vote online for their top five MVP picks. These selections accounted for 25% of the total vote, while the media panel&#x27;s selections accounted for the other 75%.

Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Lauren Jackson and A&#x27;ja Wilson have won the award the most times, with three selections each. Two players have won the award with different franchises—Elena Delle Donne in 2015 with the Chicago Sky and 2019 with the Washington Mystics, and Breanna Stewart in 2018 with the Seattle Storm and 2023 with the New York Liberty. Cynthia Cooper and Candace Parker and have also won the award twice.

Candace Parker is the only player to win Rookie of the Year and MVP in the same season—2008.

Jackson, both born and trained in Australia, is the only award winner trained outside the United States. 

The sculptor of the WNBA MVP Award is Marc Mellon, who is also the sculptor of the NBA MVP Trophy.

<doc id="673028" wikidata="Q467578" url="?curid=673028" title="Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>Amendments to the Constitution of Ireland are only possible by way of referendum. A proposal to amend the Constitution of Ireland must be initiated as a bill in Dáil Éireann, be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas (parliament), then submitted to a referendum, and finally signed into law by the president of Ireland. Since the constitution entered into force on 29 December 1937, there have been 32 amendments to the constitution.

Aside from amendments to the Constitution itself, the Constitution also provides for referendums on ordinary bills; this is known as an ordinary referendum. This provision has never been used.

==Procedure for amendment of the Constitution==
===Referendum===
The procedure for amending the constitution is specified in Article 46. A proposed amendment must take the form of a bill to amend the constitution initiated in Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas. It must then be passed or deemed to have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1958, a proposal to alter the voting system, did not pass the Seanad but was deemed to have passed the Seanad 90 days after it was sent by the Dáil. After passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage must set a date for the referendum not less than thirty days and not more than ninety days after the date of the order.

The Electoral Commission has functions to give a general explanation of the subject matter and text of the referendum and promote public awareness of the referendum and encourage the public to vote. From 1998 to 2023, these functions were previously carried out by a Referendum Commission established for each referendum.

A simple majority of votes cast is sufficient to carry an amendment, with no minimum turnout required for a constitutional referendum to be considered valid. The vote is conducted by secret ballot. A proposal to amend the constitution put to a referendum must not contain any other proposal. While British citizens resident in the state may vote in a general election, only Irish citizens can participate in a referendum.

===After the referendum===
Once the referendum count has concluded the referendum returning officer signs a provisional referendum certificate, and publishes a copy in . Anyone wishing to challenge the results of the referendum then has seven days to apply to the High Court for leave to present a referendum petition. If no one makes such an application, if leave is not granted, or if a petition is dismissed, the referendum certificate becomes final.

When the referendum passed and the final certificate has issued, the amendment must be signed into law by the President &quot;forthwith&quot;. Provided that the correct procedure has been complied with, the President cannot veto an amendment. The dates given for the amendments listed in this article are, unless otherwise stated, the dates on which they were signed into law. The shortest gap between the referendum and signing into law was twelve days for the 18th, 19th and 20th amendments. The longest was 899 days for the 31st amendment. No referendum has ever been annulled by the courts.

===Transitional and conditional amendments===
The Nineteenth Amendment, passed in May 1998, introduced a novel method of amendment. Its provisions allowed the later amendment to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution in 1999. The Nineteenth Amendment did not itself amend those articles, but rather introduced a temporary special mechanism by which the Government could order their amendment once it was satisfied that certain commitments made by other parties to the Good Friday Agreement had been complied with. The sections added to the text of the Constitution which provided for this later amendment to Articles no longer appear in the published official text of the Constitution, in line with their own provisions.

A similar method would have been used with the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2001 to restrict abortion, which was rejected. The proposed Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2013 to abolish Seanad Éireann involved later amendments which would have taken effect after the next general election.

The Thirty-third Amendment that established the Court of Appeal had amendments which became part of the text only on the later establishment of the Court, and transitory provisions which would not appear in later printed official versions.

===Historical methods===
As a transitional measure, for the first three years after the election of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the Oireachtas as an ordinary act. An amendment bill the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) have required a referendum. To prevent the Oireachtas abusing this provision, the President had the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in this way; President Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde&#x27;s election, every amendment has had to be put to a referendum after its passage through the Oireachtas.

==List of amendments and referendums==
The following table lists all amendments to the Constitution, and all past referendums relating to the Constitution. In general it does not list proposed amendments which were not passed by the Oireachtas, for which see the separate list of failed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland. The exception is the 2001 Twenty-second Amendment Bill, listed below to explain the gap in the numbering of subsequent amendments.

;Note:
==Proposed amendments==
A referendum was planned to be held on 7 June 2024 on ratification of the Agreement on the Unified Patent Court. However, in April 2024, the government indicated that it was considering postponing the referendum.

The following bills have been on the order paper for consideration in the Oireachtas.
==Referendums affecting court decisions==
===Rights of defendants and trial rights===
In &quot;People (AG) v. O&#x27;Callaghan&quot; (1966), the Supreme Court held that the right to liberty would permit the denial of bail in limited circumstances only, where there was sufficient evidence before the Court that the accused was likely to interfere with the course of justice; specifically, that bail could not be because of the likelihood of the commission of further offences while on bail. This decision was overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment in 1996 which inserted Article 40.4.7°, allowing for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The Amendment was passed by 75% to 25%.

In &quot;Maguire v. Ardagh&quot; (2002), the Supreme Court held that Oireachtas Inquiries did not have the power to compel witnesses to attend and to make findings against them. The Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2011 proposed to allow Oireachtas Inquiries to make findings of fact and to balance the rights of the individual against the public interest; this referendum was defeated by 53% to 47%.

===Electoral matters===
In &quot;O&#x27;Donovan v. the Attorney-General&quot; (1961), the Supreme Court held that the Electoral Amendment Act 1959 was unconstitutional and suggested that the ratio of representation to population across constituencies should differ by no more than 5%. The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1968 would have allowed a variation of up to 16.7% across constituencies. It was rejected in a referendum by 61% to 39%.

In &quot;Re Article 26 and the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1983&quot; (1984), the Supreme Court held that the proposed bill to extend voting rights in Dáil elections to British citizens was unconstitutional. The Ninth Amendment was passed in June 1984, which allowed the franchise to be extended beyond Irish citizens.

===International sovereignty===
The Third Amendment, passed in 1972, allowed Ireland to accede to the European Communities. In 1986, the government signed the Single European Act (SEA). However, Raymond Crotty sought an injunction against ratification by the state. In &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987), the Supreme Court held that the further transfer of powers from the state to the European institutions within the SEA was not &quot;necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities&quot; as provided for by the Third Amendment. Consequently, the Constitution required further amendment, before the SEA could be ratified. This was done in a referendum later in 1987. On the same basis, further referendums on European Treaties were held on the Maastricht Treaty (in 1992), on the Amsterdam Treaty (in 1998), on the Nice Treaty (in 2001 and in 2002), and on the Lisbon Treaty (in 2008 and in 2009). Referendums were also held to the allow the State to be bound by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, and to ratify the International Criminal Court in 2001 and the Stability Treaty in 2012.

===Abortion===

In &quot;McGee v. The Attorney General&quot; (1974), the Supreme Court found that provisions of Articles 40 and 41 guaranteed a right to marital privacy, and that contraception on prescription could not be prohibited to a married couple. In &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965), the United States Supreme Court came to a similar result, before finding for a general right to abortion in the first trimester in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973). The Eighth Amendment in 1983 gave constitutional protection to the life of the unborn, and therefore prohibiting abortion. This had been partly to guard against the Supreme Court finding the same right that their American counterparts had.

In March 1992, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Attorney General v X&quot;, commonly known as the X Case, that a teenage girl was entitled to an abortion as there was a risk to her life from suicide. Opponents of abortion feared that this ruling could only be enforced in a way that would lead to an expansive abortion regime of the kind found in many other countries. There were two failed amendments that would have excluded suicide as grounds for abortion, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1992 and the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2001. The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 made provisions for the finding of the court in the X Case, allowing abortion where the life of the woman was at risk, including a risk of suicide.

The Thirteenth Amendment was passed in 1992, to guarantee a right to travel. This addressed the injunction which the High Court had granted in the X Case to order the return of the girl to the country. Though the injunction was lifted by the Supreme Court, a majority of the Court had found that were it not for the risk to life of the defendant, an injunction would have been maintained.

The Fourteenth Amendment was passed on the same day in 1992, to guarantee that the ban on abortion would not limit freedom to obtain or make available information relating to services lawfully available in another state. This was in response to two cases: &quot;Attorney General (Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd.) v Open Door Counselling Ltd. and Dublin Wellwoman Centre Ltd.&quot; (1988), which granted an injunction restraining two counseling agencies from assisting women to travel abroad to obtain abortions or informing them of the methods of communications with such clinics, and &quot;Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (Ireland) Ltd. v Grogan&quot; (1989), which placed an injunction restraining three students&#x27; unions from distributing information in relation to abortion available outside the state.

The Eighth Amendment was repealed in 2018 with the passage of the Thirty-sixth Amendment, thus allowing abortion to be legalised again.

==Amendments to previous constitutions==
Before the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland, Ireland had two previous Constitutions: the Dáil Constitution of the short-lived 1919–1922 Irish Republic, and the constitution of the 1922–1937 Irish Free State.

The Dáil Constitution was enacted by Dáil Éireann (which was at that time a single chamber assembly).

The Constitution of the Irish Free State was adopted in October 1922 and came in force on 6 December 1922. It originally provided for a process of amendment by means of a referendum. However the constitution could initially be amended by the Oireachtas for eight years. The Oireachtas chose to extend that period, meaning that for the duration of its existence, the Free State constitution could be amended at will by parliament. By virtue of the 1922 Constitution Act, the constitution could not be amended in a way with conflicted with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 ratified by both the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic. However the Statute of Westminster removed that restriction in 1931 as far as British (but not Irish) law was concerned. It was amended 24 times between 1925 and 1936.

<text>The Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Award is an annual Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) award given since the 1998 WNBA season, to the top rookie of the regular season. The winner is selected by a panel of sportswriters throughout the United States, each of whom casts a vote for first, second and third place selections. Each first-place vote is worth five points; each second-place vote is worth three points; and each third-place vote is worth one point. The player(s) with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.

The 2003 award winner Cheryl Ford and 2011 award winner Maya Moore are the only players to win both the WNBA Rookie of the Year award and a WNBA championship in the same season.

The 2008 award winner was Candace Parker who became the first player to win the award after garnering all possible votes and also the first player to win the WNBA Most Valuable Player Award in the same season. In the NBA, only Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld have won the Most Valuable Player Award and Rookie of the Year Award in the same season.

The 2020 award winner, Crystal Dangerfield, is the first who was not chosen in the first round of the draft; she was chosen in the second round in 2020 as the 16th overall pick.

As of 2019, eight Rookie of the Year recipients have gone on to become a member of a WNBA championship team.

<doc id="673033" wikidata="Q982378" url="?curid=673033" title="Michel Corrette">
<text>Michael Corrette (10 April 1707 – 21 January 1795) was a French composer, organist and author of musical method books.

==Life==
Corrette’s father, Gaspard Corrette, was an organist and composer. Little is known of his early life. 

In 1726, Corrette entered into a competition for the post of organist at the Church of Sainte Marie-Madeleine in Paris, but was not selected. He then earned his living as a music teacher (which in fact made him more money than he would have as an organist), and in 1727 he published his first collections of sonatas for various instruments such as the flute, violin, brass, musette, and hurdy-gurdy.

On 8 January 1733, Corrette married Marie-Catherine Morize, with whom he had two children, Marie-Anne (1734 - ca. 1822), and a son, Pierre-Michel (1744 - 1801), who also became an organist.

In 1737, Corrette was appointed as the organist at the Church of Sainte Marie du Temple in Paris - a position he held for 54 years until 1791. In 1742, he wrote a so-called &quot;Turkish&quot; concerto in honour of the Ottoman Ambassador to France, Yirmisekizzade Mehmed Said Pasha, who was a great admirer of French culture. In addition to his post at the Sainte Marie Church, he served as organist at the Jesuit College in Paris from 1758 until his dismissal in 1762. It is also known, based on annotations in his methodic pieces for double bass, that he traveled to England before 1773. In 1780 he was appointed organist to the Duke of Angoulême.

In 1791, he lost his longtime position at the Sainte-Marie Church. (The church was sold to a private citizen and would be demolished several years later.) Despite this, he took a keen interest in the events taking place in his country, and wrote several musical paeans celebrating the Revolution, all now lost.

Michel Corrette died on 21 January 1795 in Paris, the city in which he spent almost all of his career, at the age of 87. A street in Rouen, his birthplace, bears his name.

==Music==
Corrette was prolific. He composed ballets and divertissements for the stage, including &quot;Arlequin&quot;, &quot;Armide&quot;, &quot;Le Jugement de Midas&quot;, &quot;Les Âges&quot;, &quot;Nina&quot;, and &quot;Persée&quot;. He composed many concertos, notably 25 &quot;concertos comiques.&quot; Aside from these works and keyboard concertos, he also composed sonatas, songs, instrumental chamber works, harpsichord pieces, cantatas, and other sacred vocal works. Most of his sacred works have not survived, some exceptions being the &quot;Laudate Dominum&quot; and Four Masses for Two Voices from 1788.

Despite living well into the Classical era (he outlived Mozart by four years, dying in 1795 just a few months short of 88), Corrette&#x27;s musical idiom was very conservative, and he continued to compose in the Baroque style at least up to the 1770s.

==His teaching==
Aside from playing the organ and composing music, Corrette organized concerts and taught music. He wrote nearly twenty music method books for various instruments—the violin, cello, bass, flute, recorder, bassoon, harpsichord, harp, mandolin, voice and more—with titles such as &quot;l&#x27;Art de se perfectionner sur le violon&quot; (The Art of Playing the Violin Perfectly), &quot;le Parfait Maître à chanter&quot; (The Perfect Mastersinger) and &quot;L′école d′Orphée&quot; (The School of Orpheus), a violin treatise describing the French and Italian styles. These pedagogical works by Corrette are valuable because they &quot;give lucid insight into contemporary playing techniques.&quot;

<text>The Moana Hotel is a historic hotel building in Honolulu, Hawaii, located at 2365 Kalākaua Avenue in the Waikiki neighborhood. Built in the late 19th century as the first hotel in Waikiki, the Moana opened in 1901. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel was also inducted into Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, in 1989. The building is currently part of the resort complex known as Moana Surfrider, A Westin Resort &amp; Spa and is managed by Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts.

==History==
===Moana Hotel===
The wealthy Honolulu landowner Walter Chamberlain Peacock, in an effort to establish a fine resort in the previously neglected Waikiki area of Honolulu, incorporated the Moana Hotel Company in 1896. Working with a design by architect Oliver G. Traphagen and $150,000 in capital, The Lucas Brothers contractors completed the structure in 1901. Construction of The Moana marked the beginning of tourism in Waikiki, becoming the first hotel amidst the bungalows and beach houses. In Hawaiian, &quot;moana&quot; means &quot;open sea&quot; or &quot;ocean.&quot;

The Moana&#x27;s architecture was influenced by European styles popular at the time, with Ionic columns and intricate woodwork and plaster detailing throughout the building. The Moana was designed with a grand porte cochere on the street side and wide lānais on the ocean side. Some of the 75 guest rooms had telephones and bathrooms (unusual at the time), and the hotel featured a billiard room, saloon, main parlor, reception area, and library. Peacock installed the first electric-powered elevator in the islands at the Moana, which is still in use. Design features of the original structure that survive to this day include extra-wide hallways (to accommodate steamer trunks), high ceilings, and cross-ventilation windows (to cool the rooms prior to air conditioning).

The Moana officially opened on March 11, 1901. Its first guests were a group of Shriners, who paid $1.50 per night for their rooms. Peacock did not find success with his endeavor and sold the hotel on May 2, 1905 to Alexander Young, a prominent Honolulu businessman who also owned the adjacent Honolulu Seaside Hotel and the Alexander Young Hotel in downtown Honolulu. After Young died in 1910, his Territorial Hotel Company operated the hotel.

The Moana grew along with the popularity of Hawaiian tourism. Two floors were added in 1918, along with Italian Renaissance-styled concrete wings on each side of the hotel, creating its &quot;H&quot;-shape seen today. In 1925, the hotel opened a series of wood frame bungalows on a large plot of land directly across Kalakaua Avenue, where the ʻĀinahau estate of Princess Kaʻiulani had been located.

The Matson Navigation Company and Castle &amp; Cooke bought a controlling interest in the Territorial Hotel Company in 1925, in order to demolish their Honolulu Seaside Hotel and construct the Royal Hawaiian Hotel on the site. Tourism to Hawaii collapsed due to the Great Depression and the Territorial Hotel Company declared bankruptcy in September 1933, with Matson assuming control of their hotels through its Hawaii Properties Ltd. division, and Castle &amp; Cooke writing off their investment.

Throughout the 1930s, the hotel was known as the Moana-Seaside Hotel &amp; Bungalows, taking on the name of its demolished neighbor.

In 1941, Hawaii Properties Ltd. was dissolved and Matson assumed direct control of the hotel.

The hotel&#x27;s outward appearance was altered slightly over the years, including &quot;updates&quot; to such designs as Art Deco in the 1930s and Bauhaus in the 1950s.

From 1935 to 1975, the Moana&#x27;s courtyard hosted the &quot;Hawaii Calls&quot; live radio broadcast. Legend has it that listeners mistook the hiss of the radio transmission as the waves breaking on the beach. Upon learning of this, the host instructed the sound man to run down to the waterfront to actually record the sound, which became a staple of the show.

In 1952, Matson built a new hotel adjacent to the Moana on the southeast side, called the SurfRider Hotel. In 1953, Matson demolished the Moana&#x27;s bungalows across the street and, two years later, opened the new Princess Kaiulani Hotel on the site. Matson sold all of their Waikiki hotel properties to the Sheraton Hotels and Resorts in 1959.

Sheraton sold the Moana and the SurfRider to Japanese industrialist Kenji Osano and his Kyo-Ya Company in December 1963 for $10.7 million, though Sheraton continued to manage them. In 1969, Kyo-Ya built a towering new hotel on the Moana&#x27;s northwest side. They named it the Surfrider Hotel. The older SurfRider Hotel on the other side was turned into part of the Moana, named the Diamond Head Wing.

===Moana Surfrider===
In 1989, a $50 million restoration restored the Moana to its 1901 appearance and incorporated the 1969 Sheraton Surfrider Hotel and the 1952 SurfRider Hotel buildings with the 1901 Moana Hotel building into one beachfront resort, the Sheraton Moana Surfrider. The property has been recognized with the President&#x27;s Historic Preservation Award, the National Preservation Honor Award, the Hawaii Renaissance Award, and the Hotel Sales and Marketing Association International Golden Bell Award. The main historic section of the hotel, the Banyan Wing, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The hotel was the base of operations for about 24 White House staff members who accompanied President Barack Obama to his Winter White House at Plantation Estate during Christmas visits.

In 2007, Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts, the management company of the Moana, rebranded the hotel from Sheraton Hotels and Resorts to Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts.

On November 12, 2024, Moana Surfrider hotel workers ratified a new contract.

==The banyan tree==
In the center of the Moana Surfrider&#x27;s courtyard stands a large banyan tree. The Indian banyan tree was planted in 1904 by Jared Smith, Director of the Department of Agriculture Experiment Station. When planted, the tree was nearly seven feet tall and about seven years old. It now stands high and spans across the courtyard.

In 1979, the historic tree was one of the first to be listed on Hawaii&#x27;s Rare and Exceptional Tree List. It has also been selected by the Board of Trustees of the America the Beautiful Fund as the site for a Hawaii Millennium Landmark Tree designation, which selects one historic tree in each state for protection in the new millennium.

==Hotel lore==

===Rich and famous===
As soon as the Moana Hotel opened, a non-stop flood of tourists from the mainland United States poured through its doors. Its most famous guest came in 1920. The Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, gallivanted around the Moana Hotel property and reportedly fell in love with the private pier, from which he frequently dove into the ocean.

In August 1922, author Agatha Christie and her husband, Colonel Archie Christie, stayed on holiday. They were traveling around the world as part of the Dominion Mission of the British Empire Exhibition, promoting the exhibition to be held in England in 1924.

In February 1905, Jane Stanford, co-founder of Stanford University, died of strychnine poisoning in a room at the Moana Hotel. Stanford is believed to have been murdered, but the source of the strychnine was never identified.

<doc id="673046" wikidata="Q538087" url="?curid=673046" title="Tender Prey">
<text>Tender Prey is the fifth studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 19 September 1988 on Mute Records. Produced by Flood, the album was recorded during several sessions over the course of four months in London and West Berlin (where the band were based at the time of its release) and dedicated to the Brazilian actor Fernando Ramos da Silva.

== Details ==
The album opens with frontman Nick Cave&#x27;s signature song, &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot;, which has been subsequently played at almost all of the band&#x27;s live performances since 1988, and was later covered by one of Cave&#x27;s influences, Johnny Cash, on &quot;American III: Solitary Man&quot; (2000). &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; was released as a single in May 1988 prior to the album&#x27;s release and &quot;Deanna&quot; was released in September. On the CD version, the video mix of &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; is also included as the last track. &quot;Deanna&quot; is loosely based on the Edwin Hawkins Singers version of the hymn &quot;Oh Happy Day&quot;. Subsequently, Cave issued an acoustic version of a medley of both songs. Hawkins&#x27; version was later issued on &quot;Original Seeds&quot; Vol. 1. &quot;City of Refuge&quot; is noted in the credit listing as being inspired by a Blind Willie Johnson song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Run to the City of Refuge&quot;. This was later issued on &quot;Original Seeds&quot; Vol. 1.

Upon its release, &quot;Tender Prey&quot; received positive reviews and charted in the United Kingdom and Greece. However, the album failed to chart in either the band&#x27;s native Australia or the United States &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The album was remastered and reissued on 29 March 2010 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set and in October 2010. It was also listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;, alongside &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; (1997), in the Top 30.

Cave later said, &quot;It was a nightmare, that record. It is reflective of a group—particularly myself—who was just writing songs and there was no larger idea behind it. Sometimes some of the group was there, sometimes they weren&#x27;t. I hear bad production and I hear bad performances as well.&quot; Cave later admitted that the album, &quot;was made at a difficult time in my life when things were spiralling out of control in a lot of areas.&quot;

In 2012, the album was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s Sounds of Australia.

== Track listing ==
Note: Early issues of the CD version of the album had a track indexing issue in which &quot;Sunday&#x27;s Slave&quot; and &quot;Sugar Sugar Sugar&quot; were indexed as the same track.

<text>Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani (; 1931 – 16 June 2007) was an Iranian Twelver Shia Marja&#x27;. He was student of Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi. He was a child of a Persian mother and an Azerbaijani father.

==Biography and clerical activities==
Lankarani was born in Qom, Iran. His father was from Lankaran (now in today&#x27;s Azerbaijan Republic) who studied in Najaf and Qom and eventually settled in the latter. His mother was a woman of Sayed descent. Lankarani was fluent in Arabic, Azerbaijani, Persian, and Russian.

Lankarani received his ijtihad, the permission of independent interpretation of the legal sources (the Qur&#x27;an and the Sunnah), from Ayatollah Boroujerdi at the age of 25. He led the prayer in the haram of Bibi Masouma A.S in Qum.

Grand Ayatollah Fazel Lankarani was declared as the most knowledgeable specialist in the field of Islamic law (Marja al-taqlid) by the central Shi&#x27;a school of religious studies in Qom, Hawza &#x27;Ilmiyyah, after the death of Ayatollah Khomeini. At the time of his death, he was one of seven Grand Ayatollahs in Iran. His Resalah, the book including his interpretation of Islamic laws on different topics, is available in Arabic, English, Persian, Turkish, and other languages. Lankarani taught in the areas of the interpretation of Islamic law (fiqh) and Usul al-fiqh for the last 25 years of his life.

As a Shia Grand Ayatollah, he received generous contributions from his many followers. According to author Hooman Majd &quot;one of Lankarani&#x27;s aides&quot; told him that &quot;approximately ten million dollars a month flows&quot; into Lankarani&#x27;s treasury &quot;from his supporters alone.&quot;

Fazel Lankarani was a strong supporter of Ayatollah Khomeini, being jailed several times and exiled once prior to the Iranian revolution. After the Iranian Revolution, he was a member of the Assembly of Experts, Iran&#x27;s leading religious body.

As his health conditions deteriorated he moved from the holy city of Qom to Tehran and then to London to receive medical treatment then on Friday 15 June 2007 he moved to Qom and he died on Saturday, June 16, 2007.
==Views and fatwas==
Politically, Lankarani followed the traditions of the Islamic Republic in criticizing western corruption in the Islamic world.

Fazel Lankarani supported Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s fatwa calling for the death of Salman Rushdie following the publication of &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot; in 1989 and called on Muslims to kill that author. He (along with some other senior clerics) continued to call the killing of Rushdie a &quot;duty&quot; for all Muslims although the Iranian government itself ceased to do so in a 1998 compromise with the British government. In 1998, Lankarani called for the Iranian government to do &quot;its utmost&quot; to protect Shiites in Afghanistan, then reportedly endangered by the Taliban.

Lankarani also issued a fatwa calling for the deaths of another author, Rafiq Tağı, an Azeri writer, and Tagi&#x27;s editor, Samir Sədaqətoğlu, who were accused of criticizing Islam. Tagi&#x27;s writings sparked recent demonstrations outside the Azerbaijani embassy in Teheran. According to Iranian and Islamic law, these sentences are only applicable if either individual freely and wilfully enters Iran and submit themselves to the authorities. Possibly related to the fatwa, Rafiq Tağı died in a Baku hospital on November 19, 2011, after having been stabbed with a knife seven times in public.

Lankarani believed strongly in the separation of sexes and opposed President Ahmadinejad&#x27;s declaration that women have the right to attend soccer matches at stadiums despite the fact that they would see male soccer players. He &quot;famously refused for weeks&quot; to meet with President Ahmadinejad in early 2007 after the president attempted to open soccer events to women. Lankarani was also staunchly opposed to Iran joining CEDAW. When the parliament (the Iranian Majles) was going to debate the signing and ratification of CEDAW, he announced that joining CEDAW and moving toward gender equality would contradict Islamic values.

He is one of the Ulama signatories of the Amman Message, which gives a broad foundation for defining Muslim orthodoxy.

<text>Oakey is a rural town and locality in the Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia. The Museum of Army Aviation is located at Oakey Airport.

In the , the locality of Oakey had a population of 4,756 people.

== Geography ==

The town is situated on the eastern side of the Darling Downs and the Toowoomba Region local government area. Oakey Creek, a tributary of the Condamine River, passes through the town.

Oakey is one of the towns contained in the Queensland State Electoral district of Condamine and at the federal level it lies within the Division of Groom.

The town is surrounded by farms.

The town is bypassed by the Warrego Highway (National A2), and is also on the main rail link connecting Brisbane and Toowoomba with south-western Queensland.

The Western railway line passes through the locality which is served by two railway stations: 

* Boolee railway station, on a spur line west of the town ()
* Oakey railway station, serving the town ()

Oakey Airport is an airport (). It is located on the site of the World War 2 airbase. The Oakey Army Aviation Centre is the major user of the airport.

== History ==

Oakey and the creek around which the town is located were named for the river oaks that dominate the banks of the creek.

=== 19th century ===
The area was first settled in the early 1840s when pastoralists moved into the area and found the land to be suitable for grazing.

In 1859, the Jondaryan Woolshed was built to the west of the town to service the rapidly growing wool industry. The first shearing took place in 1861. The Jondaryan pastoral station dominated the area, encompassing over . The woolshed was responsible for over 200,000 head of sheep and could cater for in excess of 50 shearers working simultaneously. Following World War I, the homestead landholding was reduced and separated to allow for soldier settlement programs.

The building of the Western railway line through the area in 1867 prompted the growth of a township to service the pastoral community. Growth of the town was slow, however featured some enterprising ventures, including a short-lived meatworks near the town, which planned to tin and export kangaroo and wallaby under the marketing name &#x27;Australian Game&#x27;. The enterprise was unsuccessful and closed down in 1876.

The town was surveyed in 1868, with the first sale being 28 June 1870. Originally named Oaky, the spelling of Oakey was officially adopted in August 1940.

Oakey Creek Post Office opened on 1 June 1869. It was renamed Oakey by 1878.

Oakey Creek Vested School opened on 10 August 1874, with a number of celebrations:&quot;A grand picnic and ball was held here on the 3rd instant in honor of the opening of the above school. The school-house is a neat weatherboard building, shingled, and with a verandah on each side, and capable of accommodating between sixty and seventy children, and will amply supply the requirements of the district for years to come. The teacher&#x27;s residence is a smart little four roomed cottage, but I should think rather small. The appointment of Mr. Tait as teacher is sure to give satisfaction.&quot;The school was later renamed Oakey Creek State School. In 1905, it was renamed Oakey State School.

=== 20th century ===
Scots Presbyterian Church opened in 1906. A new church was built in 1957.

St Monica&#x27;s Catholic Church was opened on Sunday 14 February 1909 by Reverend D. Fouhy. The land was and the church was a Gothic structure, with walls, capable of seating 200 people. Messrs Marks and Lane were the architects and Mr Andrews was the contractor. The church was enlarged in 1919 to accommodate a school. A new brick church was built in 1957.

The Cooyar railway line serviced the areas to the north of Oakey between 1913 and 1968. Between 1914 and 1984 the area to the southwest was serviced by the Cecil Plains railway line.

St Monica&#x27;s Catholic School was officially opened on Sunday 26 October 1919 by Archbishop James Duhig. The church building had been enlarged to accommodate both the church and the school.

The Oakey War Memorial in Campbell Street was unveiled on 28 August 1922 by the Governor of Queensland, Sir Matthew Nathan. It was made &quot;of Rockhampton marble on a pedestal of sandstone, with a polished granite centre piece, on which are inscribed in gold letters the names of no fewer than 332 soldiers of the Oakey district who took part in the Great War.&quot;

The Country Women&#x27;s Association opened a branch in Oakey in 1924, which was noted to be &#x27;thriving&#x27; in 1925, and celebrated 90 years of activity in 2014.

The racehorse Bernborough was foaled at Rosalie Plains in 1939. He became well-known on the tracks around Toowoomba. Eventually the horse was sold to a businessman in Sydney and raced in three states, winning 15 consecutive races between 22 December 1945 and 19 October 1946.

During World War II, the requirement for aircraft maintenance and construction exceeded the capabilities of Brisbane-based facilities. To expand the capability, a site at Oakey was purchased to facilitate the raising of Number 6 Aircraft Depot (6AD). An airbase was sited approximately north of the town, and runways were built. With a full complement of RAAF personnel, the base housed almost 2,000 troops. The Depot serviced, assembled and conducted test flights of Bristol Beaufort, P-51 Mustang, Norsemen, CAC Wirraway and Supermarine Spitfire aircraft. This airfield became an Army Aviation Training Centre in the 1970s, now Swartz Barracks, a major helicopter pilot and maintenance training facility for the Defence forces.

After the war, the Oakey airport was serviced by Macair Airlines commercial air services originating in Brisbane, however the failure of Macair saw services commenced by Skytrans Airlines being routed via Toowoomba. The establishment of the Wellcamp Airport south of the town, servicing Toowoomba, saw Skytrans being replaced by Qantaslink and REX airlines, and the reduction of airspace for the Army Aviation Centre.

The Oakey Veterinary Hospital was established in 1952.

Oakey State High School opened on 28 January 1964. Since 1916, there was community interest in the establishment of a high school in Oakey, with the disadvantage of &quot;scholars having to reside in Dalby, Warwick, or Toowoomba, after passing the examination&quot; acting as a deterrent to many parents from pursuing higher education for their children. In response to a skills shortage in transport and logistics Oakey State High developed an innovative program called &quot;Transport and Logistics Employees for our Community&quot;. In 2007, the successful partnership between school, training organisations and industry was recognised as the winner of the Showcase Award for Excellence in Community or Industry Partnerships by the Department of Education, Training and Employment.

In 1975, Jondaryan Woolshed Historical Museum and Park was established to present the history of Jondaryan Station and its role in the development of pastoralism on the Darling Downs. The woolshed has been in continuous operation since it was built.

Oakey State School celebrated its centenary in 1974.

The Oakey Library opened in 1975 and underwent a major refurbishment in 2014.

On Sunday 31 May 1987, the Oakey Uniting Church was officially opened and dedicated by Reverend Barry Dangerfield, the Queensland Moderator of the Uniting Church in Australia. The hall beside the church was formerly the Maclagan Union Church.

The Oakey Power Station is a 332 MW dual liquid/gas-fired plant and was commissioned in December 1999.

=== 21st century ===
The main town centre was redeveloped during 2005 by the council and now includes new shops, landscaping and tree plantings.
In January 2011 the Oakey Creek flooded, impacting 120 homes and businesses. In 2014 a Flood Early Warning System was installed upstream.

In 2014, the Department of Defense investigated a contamination caused by fire-fighting foams used at the Army Aviation Training Centre and warned residents not to drink bore water. The chemicals have been identified as perfluorooctane sulphonate and perfluorooctanoic acid. The chemicals were used from 1970 until 2008. A lack of testing of these chemicals means no conclusive impact on human health has been proven. In 2020, a class action by residents by Oakey, Katherine, and Williamtown (all communities where the fire-fighting foams were used) was successful in establishing that news of the foam contamination had caused property prices in the affected communities to plummet. In December 2021, a 3-year study conducted by the Australian National University announced they did not find conclusive evidence of an increased risk of cancer or other disease because of the contamination.

== Local government administration ==
Oakey has been part of Toowoomba Regional Council since 2008. However, like many small towns in regional Queensland it has been administered by various local government entities over its history.

Its lowest recorded temperature is −7.5 °C (18.5 °F) and its highest recorded temperature is 42.8 °C (107.2 °F).
== Transport ==
Oakey is connected to Toowoomba and Brisbane by bus.

== In popular culture ==
Oakey has been regularly mentioned on the Australian soap opera, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, with characters both originating from the town and moving to the town. One of the most well-known Oakey residents was Drew Kirk, and the town served as an important location for him and his family. In the 2001 season finale, Libby Kennedy went into labour in a barn while Drew and Stuart Parker were at a rodeo. Then, in 2002, Drew Kirk was thrown from a horse, sadly dying as a result. The Kirk family was revisited in 2018 when Drew’s son Ben visited the town to try and connect with the father he never knew. He is offered a job at his uncle’s garage and leaves his home in Erinsborough.

<doc id="673057" wikidata="Q4350676" url="?curid=673057" title="Memory transfer">
<text>Memory transfer was a biological process proposed by James V. McConnell and others in the 1960s. Memory transfer proposes a chemical basis for memory termed memory [[RNA]] which can be passed down through flesh instead of an intact nervous system. Since RNA encodes information and living cells produce and modify RNA in reaction to external events, it might also be used in neurons to record stimuli. This was proposed as an explanation for the results of McConnell&#x27;s experiments in which planarians retained memory of acquired information after regeneration.

In McConnell&#x27;s experiments, he classically conditioned planarians to contract their bodies upon exposure to light by pairing it with an electric shock. The planarians retained this acquired information after being sliced and regenerated, even after multiple slicings to produce a planarian where none of the original trained planarian was present. The same held true after the planarians were ground up and fed to untrained cannibalistic planarians, usually &quot;Dugesia dorotocephala&quot;. As the nervous system was fragmented but the nucleic acids were not, this seemed to indicate the existence of memory RNA. Some further experiments seem to support the original findings in that some memories may be stored outside the brain,
but McConnell&#x27;s experiments proved to be largely irreproducible and it was later suggested that only sensitization was transferred, or that no transfer occurred and the effect was due to stress hormones in the donor or pheromone trails left on dirty lab glass. Memory transfer through memory RNA is not currently a well-accepted explanation for the planarian behavior.

<text>The District of Grevenmacher (1843 – 3 Oct 2015) was one of three districts of Luxembourg. It contained three cantons divided into 25 communes:

#Echternach
#*Beaufort
#*Bech
#*Berdorf
#*Consdorf
#*Echternach
#*Rosport-Mompach
#*Waldbillig
#Grevenmacher
#*Betzdorf

#*Burmerange
#*Dalheim
#*Lenningen
#*Mondorf-les-Bains
#*Remerschen
#*Remich
#*Stadtbredimus
#*Waldbredimus

<doc id="673062" wikidata="Q3369905" url="?curid=673062" title="Test the Nation">
<text>Test the Nation is a television programme, first broadcast in 2001 by BNN in the Netherlands. The concept is owned by Eyeworks Holding who license it to TV production companies around the world.

==Show format==
The format is designed to allow viewers to answer a number of questions in order to measure their IQ or their ability in some other &#x27;intellectual&#x27; area. For instance, in the UK (where the show ran between 2002 and 2007) there have been editions of the show devoted to general knowledge, knowledge of the UK itself, and the English language. There is also an annual test of the year&#x27;s events just before Christmas.

Typically there is a studio audience who answer the questions along with the viewer. The studio demography is broken down into categories often designed to challenge or affirm stereotypes. For example, in the United Kingdom, white-van men and fashion models are commonly thought to be less intelligent, whilst doctors and scientists are &quot;expected&quot; to score highly. The fun is in comparing your score against your compatriots. There is also a group of celebrities pitting their wits against the audience, and one or more &#x27;experts&#x27;, who comment on aspects of the particular show&#x27;s topic.

==International versions==
The TV format has been sold in other countries like: Czech Republic, Denmark, Indonesia, Norway, Turkey and in the Middle East on the Arabic channel MBC1.

===United Kingdom===
The British version, made by Talent Television for the BBC, was originally presented by Anne Robinson and Phillip Schofield. It ran for 17 editions between 2002 and 2007. The BBC tests were devised and standardised by the academic Colin Cooper, of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, who was sometimes referred to on the programme as &#x27;Sooperman Cooperman&#x27;.

Viewers could play along using interactive television, log onto the BBC website, or just use a pen and paper to keep score.

The first show, in May 2002, was an IQ test and the six groups of 50 studio participants included blondes, builders, publicans, teachers and students. They were pitted against a group of 10 celebrities including &quot;EastEnders&quot; star Adam Woodyatt, pop music presenter Jayne Middlemiss, Olympic athlete Jonathan Edwards and former &quot;Sunday Times&quot; editor and broadcaster Andrew Neil. The teachers came out on top. The last IQ test in the UK was shown on 27 August 2007, when the studio groups were reality show contestants, clairvoyants, surgeons, removal men, Robinsons, Wallaces and celebrities. In this episode Danny Wallace, a successful writer, made his first appearance as co-host. He replaced Phillip Schofield, who had joined ITV at the time. Experts who joined Dr Colin Cooper on the IQ test panel have included Sylvia Herbert, a director of British Mensa (2002 and 2003) and Baroness Susan Greenfield, scientist and polymath (2004).

Although there was usually an end-of-year test in the UK each year around Christmas, there wasn&#x27;t one at the end of 2006. But at the start of 2007 there was a similar programme broadcast on BBC One called &quot;Your Country Needs You&quot;, presented by Patrick Kielty, with the same general format.

===United States===
The American version aired as a two-hour special on Fox TV on 9 June 2003 and on 5 March 2004 as &quot;Test the Nation 2&quot;. Hosted by Mark L. Walberg and Leeza Gibbons.

===Ireland===
&quot;Test the Nation: The National IQ Test&quot; is an RTÉ Television programme, based on the successful BBC concept, &quot;Test the Nation&quot;.

First airing on RTÉ One on 5 June 2006, the show follows the UK format almost identically. In studio, two presenters oversee proceedings, which feature 6 teams of 40 contestants from various sectors of society. Members of the public participate by SMS or via the internet. The Macromedia Flash applications used are identical to those used by the BBC. A trial version of the application appeared prior to the first quiz night, featuring 12 questions on a number of topics, including the Birmingham Six, the former occupants of the Grafton Street site now occupied by Brown Thomas, and which Irish alcohol company Salvatore Schillaci advertised for.

This version of &quot;Test the Nation&quot; covers the whole island of Ireland as opposed to just the Republic; thus there is overlap between the content of the RTÉ and BBC versions of the show. As opposed to the BBC system of division by nearest city (which let people in Ireland enter if they chose Belfast), RTÉ divide results by historical Irish county.

The first show
The show first aired on RTÉ One on 5 June 2006, with Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan and Ray D&#x27;Arcy overseeing proceedings. As well as historical Irish counties, 
other questions asked for demographic division included the participants preference for tea or cappuccino, and their support for Roy Keane or Mick McCarthy during The Saipan Incident.

Their in-studio teams were Hairdressers, Football fans, an extended family from County Clare, employees of Revenue, Estate Agents, a collection of people who had done their Leaving Certificate in 1986, and the &quot;RTÉ Allstars&quot;, a collection of RTÉ presenters including Eddie Hobbs and Charlie Bird.

The show was nominally part of, and the last show in, an RTÉ series &quot;The Time of Our Lives&quot;, covering the 20 years from 1986 to 2006, during which the Irish economy changed the country unrecognisably.

The second show
This aired on 1 January 2007 and was presented by Miriam again but this time Craig Doyle was her co-host. It was a test of the nation&#x27;s IQ. It was revealed that the county with the highest IQ was Monaghan. Panelists included Neil Delamere, Cathy Kelly and Aoibhinn Ní Shúilleabháin.

===Canada===
&quot;Test the Nation&quot; debuted in Canada 18 March 2007 on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation with the episode &quot;Test the Nation: IQ&quot;. A second episode called &quot;Test the Nation: Watch Your Language&quot; was broadcast on 9 September 2007, a third episode aired on 20 January 2008, called &quot;Test the Nation: Trivia&quot;, and a fourth episode &quot;Test the Nation: Sports&quot; aired on Sunday 25 May at 8 pm (8:30 NT) on CBC Television. A fifth episode &quot;Test the Nation: Canada Eh?&quot; aired on Sunday 7 September at 8 pm (8:30 NT) on CBC Television.

The sixth episode called &quot;Test the Nation IQ&quot; was broadcast on 24 January 2010 and was the second version of the IQ edition. People were tested on their IQ through a test that was designed by Professor James Parker from Trent University and Professor Don Saklofske. Celebrities that had their IQ&#x27;s tested included Justin Trudeau, Dragon&#x27;s Den&#x27;s W. Brett Wilson and Our Lady Peace&#x27;s Jeremy Taggart. In an interesting twist, Test the Nation had professional hypnotherapist Donald Currie hypnotize members of each team to see if hypnosis could help them achieve better IQ test scores. 1/3 of the hypnotized group did experience a jump in IQ score of up to 10 points.

The Canadian show was hosted by Wendy Mesley and Brent Bambury for the first five editions, except &quot;Test the Nation: Sports&quot;, which was hosted by Ron MacLean and Wendy Mesley. The sixth edition was hosted by George Stroumboulopoulos and Carole MacNeil.

In the Canadian version, celebrity guests are selected to represent one of six in-studio teams. The celebrity guests also take the test and the top celebrity&#x27;s score is revealed on air. &quot;Test the Nation: Trivia&quot; featured celebrities: Farley Flex, Debbie Travis, Lorne Cardinal, Carlo Rota, Samantha Bee and Tricia Helfer. &quot;Test the Nation: Sports&quot; celebrity guests are Paul Coffey, Debra DiGiovanni, Alan Thicke, Brian Bailey, Victoria Pratt and Chris Murphy.

<doc id="673063" wikidata="Q2903793" url="?curid=673063" title="Anarchism in the United Kingdom">
<text>Anarchism in the United Kingdom initially developed within the religious dissent movement that began after the Protestant Reformation. Anarchism was first seen among the radical republican elements of the English Civil War and following the Stuart Restoration grew within the fringes of radical Whiggery. The Whig politician Edmund Burke was the first to expound anarchist ideas, which developed as a tendency that influenced the political philosophy of William Godwin, who became the first modern proponent of anarchism with the release of his 1793 book &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;.

The development of socialism from radicalism started in the 1860s with the establishment of the International Workingmen&#x27;s Association (IWA), and saw the foundation of a number of workers&#x27; societies demanding radical reform and civil liberties. By the 1870s, anarchism had been introduced to the country from Europe and America and the establishment of the Labour Emancipation League (LEL) in 1881 marked the beginning of the organized anarchist movement in the United Kingdom. The LEL was instrumental in the foundation of the Socialist League, which in 1888 came under the control of the anarchist Frank Kitz.

The Socialist League&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Commonweal&quot; and Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Freedom&quot; saw anarchism through the turn of the 20th century. Anarcho-communism became a major tendency during the Revolutions of 1917–1923, when the Glasgow anarchist Guy Aldred established the Anti-Parliamentary Communist Federation and later the United Socialist Movement. The rise of anarcho-syndicalism after the Spanish Civil War eventually resulted in the foundation of the Solidarity Federation in 1950, followed by resurgence of anarcho-communism during the 1980s, when the Class War and Anarchist Federation were founded.

==History==
The historian Peter Marshall traced the roots of British anarchism back to the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, during which yeomans rose up against the Bad Parliament&#x27;s poll tax, fearing it to be an attempt by the nobility to force the yeomanry into serfdom. The peasants were further agitated by the preaching of the radical priest John Ball, who conceived of the Garden of Eden as a state of nature where class stratification did not yet exist, attacked the institutions of private property and social inequality, and called for everything to be brought under common ownership and the creation of a classless society. With Wat Tyler elected as their captain, 100,000 peasant rebels marched from Essex to London, where they were joined by the local population. Although Richard II had promised them that he would free the villeins, the rebels demolished the Savoy Palace, released all the local prisoners and executed Simon Sudbury, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Now that the rebels had captured the capital, they issued their demands, which included the introduction of wage labour, the cessation of feudal duties and the establishment of a free market. The King agreed to most of their demands in his meetings with the rebel leaders, during which Tyler called for the total abolition of serfdom and the expansion of liberty and social equality, while his more radical lieutenant Jack Straw allegedly declared that the noble and clerical classes would need to be exterminated. However, the rebel&#x27;s demands would never be met as William Walworth, the Lord Mayor of London, assassinated Tyler and Straw. The King then revoked his promises and the revolt was definitively crushed. But John Ball&#x27;s radical egalitarian philosophy lived on through the centuries, most notably being re-invoked in 1888 by William Morris, in his novel &quot;A Dream of John Ball&quot;.

===The English Revolution===
Throughout the Middle Ages, the institution of feudalism had constructed a rigidly hierarchical society, where the interests of the individual were subordinated to the divine right of kings. But following the Renaissance and Reformation, the individual first began to be considered as an autonomous entity with rights of their own. It was during the English Revolution that individual rights took their place alongside the old demands for liberty and social equality, leading to the development of recognizable anarchist tendencies. By the 16th century, the word &quot;anarchy&quot; was primarily associated with disorder and lawlessness, while the label of &quot;anarchist&quot; was pejoratively applied to anyone that upset the established order or refused to recognize the ruling power.

In the lead up to the English Civil War, radical republican and democratic ideas were first starting to circulate, advocating the abolition of existing institutions such as the monarchy, church and feudalism. In December 1640, 15,000 Londoners presented Parliament with the &quot;Root and Branch petition&quot;, advocating for the abolition of the episcopacy, a proposition which was denounced as &quot;absolute Anarchism&quot; by the royalist MP Edward Dering. When the Bill itself failed to pass, anti-clerical riots erupted in London, eventually forcing Charles I to flee the capital, along with royalist MPs and bishops, which allowed parliament the means to pass anti-clerical bills into law.

The tensions exacerbated by this situation eventually erupted into the First English Civil War, in which Parliamentarians and Covenanters were victorious over the royalist forces. Following the conflict, a radical group known as the Levellers released a series of manifestos regarding the creation of a new constitution, which became subject to debate among the parliamentary forces, as the Levellers advocated for a number of issues including progressive taxation, universal manhood suffrage and equality before the law. The radical democratic theses of the Levellers was rejected by Oliver Cromwell, who accused them of advocating the cantonalist practices of the Swiss Confederacy and declared that such policies would inevitably lead to &quot;anarchy&quot;. But the Levellers denied the charge, as they still believed in a form of &quot;good government&quot;.

Following the Parliamentarian victory in the Second English Civil War, the removal of dissenting voices from the House of Commons and the execution of Charles I, power lay entirely in the hands of the Grandees of the New Model Army. Unwilling to implement the radical policies advanced by the Levellers, the Grandees instead turned towards mysticism and the implementation of a Puritan religious order. But this new environment of Christian mysticism branched out into a variety of anti-authoritarian strains, with a number of English Dissenters separating entirely from the Church of England. These religious dissenters included the Quakers, Ranters, Anabaptists, Familists and Diggers. Notably, the Ranters and Diggers have been labelled as &quot;anarchists&quot; by historians, due to their radical egalitarian philosophies and communist practices. The Diggers believed in creating an egalitarian society of small agrarian communities and put this into practice by occupying a number of tracts of common land for the purposes of farming it, but these settlements were eventually suppressed by the authorities of the Commonwealth.

By 1653, Parliament had been forcibly dissolved by the New Model Army and the republican Commonwealth was replaced by a military dictatorship known as The Protectorate, with Oliver Cromwell acting as Lord Protector. After Cromwell&#x27;s death, Parliament was reconvened and held a Convention, which instituted the restoration of the monarchy. Within decades the Stuart-ruled kingdoms of England and Scotland were united into the Kingdom of Great Britain and the British Empire was formally established. The eventual spread of the Age of Enlightenment to Britain and the outbreak of the Industrial Revolution brought about a number of changes to the country, which allowed for the early conception of a formalized anarchist philosophy.

===The British Enlightenment===
In 1688, the Glorious Revolution definitively established a constitutional monarchy with parliamentary supremacy in Britain. The Revolution was most notably defended by John Locke, whose justifications for democratic governance laid the foundations for classical liberalism. According to Locke, while the &quot;state of nature&quot; represented a state of total liberty and social equality, competition between individuals had caused instability, which made the establishment of a government to protect &quot;life, liberty and property&quot; a necessity. This led Locke to propose the formation of a social contract between the British people and their government, which would have the power make laws and protect the institution of private property. The Lockean proviso soon came to represent a progression from the traditionalist conservatism of the established landed gentry (later known as Tories) to the propertarianism of the emerging middle classes (later known as Whigs). By the turn of the 18th-century, Lockean liberalism started to give way to libertarianism, which centered the individual freedom of citizens within the new constitutional monarchy. 

Jonathan Swift, although a conservative and misanthrope, became an early champion of Enlightenment ideals and an opponent of British rule in Ireland. In his 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Swift satirised the prevailing social mores of his day, railing against social inequality and the Protestant work ethic, among other subjects. In Book IV, Swift writes of the Houyhnhnms, an intelligent race of horses that believed society could govern itself sufficiently through reason and lived in a kind of primitive communism. Their only form of central government was a representative body, which met once every four years to coordinate resource distribution and existed only in an advisory capacity, having no authority to compel obedience. Swift&#x27;s vision of a stateless society later inspired William Godwin&#x27;s anarchist philosophy, although it would also later be criticized as &quot;totalitarian&quot; by George Orwell, who referred to Swift as a &quot;Tory anarchist&quot;.

In 1756, Edmund Burke espoused a defense of the &quot;state of nature&quot; in &quot;A Vindication of Natural Society&quot;, painting a picture of human society being governed by reason until the invention of the state and the episcopacy, in what the historian Peter Marshall described as &quot;one of the most powerful arguments for anarchist society made in the eighteenth century.&quot; Burke denounced the state as the sole reason for all social conflict and war, arguing that the division of humanity into different nationalities had created bigotry and that the social stratification of society had concentrated wealth in the hands of those that didn&#x27;t work for it. When looking at the dominant forms of government, Burke found democracy to be more preferable to despotism and aristocracy, but still considered it lacking, calling for a complete rejection of church and state, and the reclamation of &quot;perfect liberty&quot;. Burke would later turn towards conservatism and disown his &quot;Vindication&quot;, claiming it to be a satire of the parliamentary opposition leader Henry St John, but the text still went on to inspire the anarchist philosophy of William Godwin and the libertarian socialism of George Holyoake. 

With the outbreak of the American Revolution, one thinker that rose to prominence was the radical Thomas Paine, who issued calls for women&#x27;s rights, the abolition of slavery and the prevention of cruelty to animals. In 1776, Paine&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot; drew considerable attention, with its calls for independence of the Thirteen Colonies and a people&#x27;s war against the British Empire, in the hope that America could inspire future revolutions abroad. Inspired by the spontaneous order that had emerged following the colonial government&#x27;s dissolution, Paine clearly elaborated a distinction between society and the state, declaring that &quot;society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil; in its worse state an intolerable one.&quot; Nevertheless, Paine still believed in the establishment of a limited government through a social contract, with a written constitution guaranteeing the rights to &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;. The end of the American Revolutionary War was followed soon after by the beginning of the French Revolution, with Paine transplanting his revolutionary politics to Europe. 

The publication of Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; ignited a fierce pamphlet war in Britain, which became known as the &quot;Revolution Controversy&quot;. In this work, Burke espoused a traditionalist conservative view of government, cautioning against radical changes to its functioning, which he believed would transfer power from the clergy and nobility to the &quot;swinish multitude.&quot; The Radicals, many of whom had themselves been inspired by Burke&#x27;s earlier writings, quickly took to the debate. One of the first responses came from the feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, whose &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot; and subsequent &quot;Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; attacked class stratification, economic inequality and gender inequality, calling for a reformed government to protect natural rights. Thomas Paine himself followed up on Wollstonecraft&#x27;s treatises with his own &quot;Rights of Man&quot;, which according to Peter Marshall displayed a &quot;libertarian sensibility [that] took him to the borders of anarchism.&quot; 

Paine took the side of the &quot;swinish multitude&quot; and criticised Burke for subordinating individual rights to the &quot;authority of the dead&quot;, adapting Lockean liberalism in the direction of libertarianism and direct democracy. To protect people&#x27;s natural rights, he again recommended the establishment of a limited government, which would itself have no authority and would be entirely subjected to the people&#x27;s authority, in order to ensure &quot;the good of all&quot;. In Part II of his pamphlet, Paine approached anarchism with his declaration that societal order would prevail even if all government were abolished, claiming that civil society &quot;performs for itself almost everything which is ascribed to government.&quot; He asserted that all order stemmed from human nature, itself fundamentally good but corrupted by established governments, and that individuals were chiefly regulated by their own common interest, rather than by legal codes. Drawing from British history, Paine concluded by calling for the establishment of a self-governing society, declaring that &quot;the instant formal government is abolished, society begins to act. A general association takes place, and common interest produces common security.&quot; He therefore considered the ideal form of government to be a limited one, solely in place to secure the natural rights of individual people, looking to the nascent federal government of the United States as an example. Despite his libertarian inclinations, it was his advocacy of constitutionalism, republicanism and propertarianism that would ultimately separate Paine from modern anarchism. 
It was during the Revolution Controversy that William Godwin published his &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;, which became the first clear expression of philosophical anarchism, with his declaration that all government ought to be abolished. Although the book was rather expensive on release, with the prime minister William Pitt even deciding against banning the book due to its high price, many British workers threw their money together to purchase a copy by subscription, pirated copies were distributed throughout Ireland and Scotland, and Godwin ended up reducing the price. When Pitt&#x27;s government began to carry out the political persecutions against the British radical movement, Godwin was among those that came to the defense of the Radicals on trial, eventually securing their release. Although alienated by the defeat of the French Revolution, Godwin&#x27;s influence extended on to the next generation of Radicals. His son-in-law Percy Bysshe Shelley became a widely-renowned poet, putting much of Godwin&#x27;s anarchist philosophy into verse, while his disciple Robert Owen went on to become the founding father of British socialism. Following his death, &quot;Political Justice&quot; continued to inspire the Chartists and Owenites, who published new editions of the book, as well as the Ricardian socialism of Thomas Hodgskin and William Thompson, which in turn influenced the Marxist theory of the &quot;withering away of the state&quot;.

But by the turn of the 19th century, British radicals still had not adopted the term &quot;anarchist&quot; as their own. Even Godwin associated the word &quot;anarchy&quot; with disorder, although he still considered it preferable to despotism, due to its resemblance to &quot;true liberty&quot;. Nevertheless, followers of Godwin&#x27;s political philosophy found themselves being labelled as &quot;anarchists&quot;, most notably by the Tory statesman George Canning, who denounced William Godwin, Thomas Paine and the reformer John Thelwall as anarchists in the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;. 
===19th century to World War II===
The labour movement first began to take form in Britain during the early 19th century. Spearheaded by the utopian socialist Robert Owen, himself a disciple of William Godwin, the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union contributed to the early development of syndicalism in the country, while the noncomformist priest William Benbow popularized the idea of the general strike as a means for social revolution. However, the rise of the Chartists instilled the British labour movement with a largely reformist character, concerning itself mostly with parliamentary politics.

It was the arrival of migrant workers and asylum seekers in London that introduced classical anarchism to Britain, in the wake of the Revolutions of 1848. Over the decades, isolated individuals slowly began to cluster together in political clubs, such as the Rose Street Club in Soho. This process was accelerated when Johann Most moved to London and began printing his newspaper &quot;Freiheit&quot;, which before long was shut down and forced to move its operations to the United States, after friends of Most signalled their approval of the Phoenix Park Murders. 

By 1881, the movement of British revolutionary socialists towards anarchism culminated with the establishment of the Labour Emancipation League (LEL). The LEL quickly gained support for its libertarian socialist platform from the workers of London&#x27;s East End, declaring themselves against all forms of government, before they merged into the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). But the authoritarianism of the SDF&#x27;s leader Henry Hyndman caused a split within the organization, resulting in the formation of the Socialist League (SL) by a number of libertarian socialists around William Morris. Though himself a staunch anti-parliamentarian, Morris would end up leaving the SL following the rise of its anarchist faction in 1887, leading to a marked radicalization of the League&#x27;s publications under H. B. Samuels. 
Other anarchist tendencies also began to emerge around this time, including: individualist anarchism, which was developed by Henry Seymour in his publication &quot;The Anarchist&quot;; anarcho-communism, which was propagated by Peter Kropotkin through his newspaper &quot;Freedom&quot;; and Jewish anarchism, which congregated around the Yiddish language journal &quot;Arbeter Fraynd&quot;. Anarchist tendencies also worked their way into the popular literature of the time, with William Morris&#x27; &quot;News from Nowhere&quot; depicting a utopian society and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Soul of Man Under Socialism&quot; espousing the importance of individualism, while libertarian ideas were likewise defended by authors such as George Bernard Shaw, Edward Carpenter and Henry Stephens Salt.

But anarchism was unable to win over the more reform-minded labour movement, with anarcho-syndicalism only developing at the turn of the 20th century. In the 1910s, Tom Mann&#x27;s Industrial Syndicalist Education League attempted to encourage the establishment of industrial unions in Britain, advocating for direct class conflict with the goal of workers&#x27; control. But the influence of anarcho-syndicalism waned in the wake of World War I, which caused a split within the anarchist movement. Although anarcho-communists like Guy Aldred attempted to keep the movement alive, by the mid-1920s, the British anarchist movement had almost dissolved, with only a few anarchist groups remaining in urban centers. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War brought with it a revival of the British anarchist movement, which cultivated a new generation of anarchists by the subsequent outbreak of World War II. 

===Post-war era===
When Vernon Richards and three other editors were arrested at the beginning of 1945 for attempting &quot;to undermine the affections of members of His Majesty&#x27;s Forces.&quot;, Benjamin Britten, E. M. Forster, Augustus John, George Orwell, Herbert Read (chairman), Osbert Sitwell and George Woodcock set up the Freedom Defence Committee to &quot;uphold the essential liberty of individuals and organizations, and to defend those who are persecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of speech, writing and action.&quot; 

The Syndicalist Workers&#x27; Federation was a syndicalist group active in post-war Britain, and one of the Solidarity Federation&#x27;s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain (AFB). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset. The group joined the International Workers&#x27; Association and during the Franco era gave particular support to the Spanish resistance and the underground CNT anarcho-syndicalist union, previously involved in the 1936 Spanish Revolution and subsequent Civil War against a right-wing military coup backed by both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The SWF initially had some success, but when Tom Brown, a long-term and very active member was forced out of activity, it declined until by 1979 it had only one lone branch in Manchester. The SWF then dissolved itself into the group founded as the Direct Action Movement. Its archives are held by the International Institute of Social History, and a selection of the SWFs publications have been digitally published at libcom.org.

Colin Ward was an editor of the British anarchist newspaper &quot;Freedom&quot; from 1947 to 1960, and founder/editor of the monthly anarchist journal &quot;Anarchy&quot; from 1961 until it ceased publication in 1970. There were 118 issues. It is not to be confused with the subsequent, shorter-lived magazine of the same name, sometimes referred to as Anarchy (Second Series), which was edited/published by a quite separate group.

Over the years the Freedom editorial group included Jack Robinson, Pete Turner, Colin Ward, Nicolas Walter, Alan Albon, John Rety, Nino Staffa, Dave Mansell, Gillian Fleming, Mary Canipa, Philip Sansom, Arthur Moyse and numerous others. Clifford Harper maintained a loose association for 30 years.
The leading anarcho-pacifist writer and gerontologist Alex Comfort characterised himself as an &quot;aggressive anti-militarist&quot;. He held that pacifism rested &quot;solely upon the historical theory of anarchism&quot;. An active member of the Peace Pledge Union (PPU) and the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, he had been a conscientious objector in World War II. In 1951 Comfort was a signatory of the 
Authors’ World Peace Appeal. He later resigned from its committee, asserting that Soviet sympathisers now dominated the AWPA. He later in the decade actively supported the Direct Action Committee against Nuclear War. A prominent member of the Committee of 100, he was
imprisoned for a month, together with Bertrand Russell and others. They had refused to be bound over, not to take part in a Trafalgar Square mass protest in September 1961. Comfort is &quot;Peace and Disobedience&quot; (1946), one of many pamphlets he wrote for Peace News and PPU, and &quot;Authority and Delinquency in the Modern State&quot; (1950). He exchanged public correspondence with George Orwell defending pacifism in the open letter/poem, &quot;Letter to an American Visitor&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;Obadiah Hornbrooke&quot;. Comfort&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; earned him worldwide fame and $3 million. He regretted that he as a consequence became known as &quot;Dr. Sex&quot; and that his numerous other works received so little attention.

On the last day of July 1964 an 18-year-old Stuart Christie departed London for Paris, where he picked up plastic explosives from the anarchist organisation Defensa Interior, and then Madrid on a mission to kill General Francisco Franco. This was to be one of at least 30 attempts on the dictator&#x27;s life. After his release he continued his activism in the anarchist movement in the United Kingdom, re-formed the Anarchist Black Cross and &quot;Black Flag&quot; with Albert Meltzer, was acquitted of involvement with the Angry Brigade, and started the publishing house Cienfuegos Press (later Refract Publications), which for a number of years he operated from the remote island of Sanday, Orkney, where he also edited and published a local Orcadian newspaper, &quot;The Free-Winged Eagle&quot;. Christie wrote with Meltzer, &quot;The Floodgates of Anarchy&quot; and later &quot;We, the Anarchists! A study of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (FAI) 1927-1937&quot; (2000).

Around the turn of the century, demonstrated against Britain&#x27;s monarchy in 1998 and 2000. The anarchists planned a campaign for mid 2002. Demonstrators arrested during the 2002 Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II were later compensated for unlawful arrest.

Anarchists were involved in late-20th-century war opposition, with campaigns like No War but the Class War during the early 1990s First Gulf War.

<doc id="673067" wikidata="Q965613" url="?curid=673067" title="Murder Ballads">
<text>Murder Ballads is the ninth studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 5 February 1996 by Mute Records. As its title suggests, the album consists of new and traditional murder ballads, a genre of songs that relays the details (and often consequences) of crimes of passion.

&quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, a duet featuring Cave singing with fellow Australian singer Kylie Minogue, was a hit single and received two ARIA Music Awards in 1996. Other prominent guest musicians on the album include then-partner PJ Harvey and Shane MacGowan of the Pogues.

== Details ==
&quot;Murder Ballads&quot; was the band&#x27;s biggest commercial success to date, most likely helped by the unexpected repeated airplay of the &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot; music video on MTV. MTV even nominated Cave for their &quot;best male artist&quot; award of that year, though this nomination was later withdrawn at Cave&#x27;s request. Cave later said, &quot;I was kind of aware that people would go and buy the &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; album and listen to it and wonder &#x27;What the fuck have I bought this for?&#x27; because the Kylie song wasn&#x27;t any true indication of what the record was actually like.&quot;

The first song written for the album was &quot;O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Bar&quot;, when the band was recording &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1992). According to Cave, the idea for the &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; album came from this song: &quot;We couldn&#x27;t use &#x27;O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s Bar&#x27; on any of our other records. So we had to make a record, an environment where the songs could exist.&quot; Recordings were done towards the end of the &quot;Let Love In&quot; (1994) sessions, and there was some thought that the early material could be made into a film with John Hillcoat. Cave said, &quot;I was going around everywhere with letters of intent, pushing them at everyone I knew, saying &#x27;Do you want to be in this film? For the TV documentary &quot;Great Australian Albums&quot; members described their work on &quot;Murder Ballads&quot;.

== Songs ==
* &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; is based on a traditional song about the African American murderer of the same name. Cave&#x27;s version draws most of the lyrics from a 1967 transcription published in the 1976 book &quot;The Life: The Lore and Folk Poetry of the Black Hustler&quot;, while the music itself is updated into a reggae song.
* &quot;Death Is Not the End&quot; includes vocalists Anita Lane, Kylie Minogue, PJ Harvey, and Shane MacGowan, along with Cave himself and Bad Seeds drummer Thomas Wydler and guitarist Blixa Bargeld. They each sing a verse in this cover of a Bob Dylan song, the only song in which an actual death does not occur. Cave later described it as, &quot;just kind of a jokey little punctuation mark to the whole thing. There&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek to that song, even though I think it&#x27;s quite a beautiful rendition.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

Upon release, &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. Bill van Parys of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;never before have manic elements elevated Cave&#x27;s shtick to art as on &quot;Murder Ballads&quot;&quot;, describing the album as &quot;literate, sultry and tortured&quot; and &quot;the performance of Nick Cave&#x27;s life.&quot; Tony Scherman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; warned that &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; was &quot;not for the squeamish,&quot; calling it &quot;the rare pop record that resonates with the weight of the ages&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Neil Strauss felt that the album &quot;is about more than storytelling&quot;, adding that Cave &quot;meticulously creates a macabre fable and then distills it to a single image of death in much the way a photographer arranges a studio shoot&quot;. In a mixed review, &quot;Spin&quot;″s Chris Norris complimented the album&#x27;s &quot;sordid epics and dark confessionals&quot;, but felt that Cave&#x27;s &quot;rheumy Poe-ish romance&quot; songs were less effective.

In the English music press, &quot;Select&quot;″s Clark Collis remarked that &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; &quot;weaves itself together into a meditation on death that is both beautiful and genuinely unnerving.&quot; Dave Henderson of &quot;Q&quot; observed that &quot;musically, the Bad Seeds touch on tinkling cabaret jazz, country-paced morbidity and every morose station between.&quot; &quot;Murder Ballads&quot; ranked number 16 on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s list of 1996&#x27;s Albums of the Year and number 7 in the &quot;NME&quot;″s 1996 critics&#x27; poll.

In December 2021, the album was ranked at no. 13 in Rolling Stone Australia&#x27;s &quot;200 Greatest Australian Albums of All Time&quot; list.

<text>Bargain Hunt is a British television programme in which two pairs of contestants are challenged to buy antiques from shops or a fair and then sell them in an auction for a profit. It has aired on BBC One since 13 March 2000 in a daytime version, and from 22 August 2002 to 13 November 2004 in a primetime version.

Bargain Hunt was originally presented by David Dickinson. From 2003 to January 2016 it was presented by Tim Wonnacott. In 2016 the format changed to a rota of hosts from a &quot;team of experts&quot; fronting the series.

==Format==
&quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; has undergone various TV formats and rule changes since it premiered in 2000. Most episodes are 45 minutes in length, though 30-minute versions and one-hour &quot;live&quot; editions have also been produced.

Two teams – designated the &quot;Reds&quot; and the &quot;Blues&quot; – compete. Each team has two members, who wear fleeces that correspond to their team&#x27;s colour. The contestants in most episodes are members of the public, though some shows feature teams of celebrity players instead. At the beginning of the show, each team is given a set amount of money with which to purchase antiques. The objective is to find items that will earn the team a profit when later sold at auction. Each team is accompanied by an antiques trade expert, though it is the contestants&#x27; decision whether to heed the advice given by their expert. After the contestants have completed their purchases and presented them to the host, home viewers are shown a &quot;what the auctioneer thinks&quot; segment in which the auctioneer appraises the buys and gives the auction estimate. At the auction, as each item is sold, the host compares the auction sale price to the price originally paid by the team, with the difference being either subtracted from or added to the team&#x27;s total. If the final total shows a profit, the team receives that profit in cash; otherwise, the team receives nothing. The profit/loss does not take into account buyer&#x27;s premium (commission) or Value Added Tax (a governmental sales tax).

The show is punctuated by footage of the host visiting a place of historical interest, such as a stately home or museum, and talking about the items housed there.

In the early David Dickinson-era episodes, teams were given £200 each, and could buy as many or as few items as they liked within the hour given to wander around a trade fair. The item rule was later changed so that teams have to buy three items. After Tim Wonnacott became host, the money was increased to £300, and a new feature called the &quot;swap item&quot; was introduced. Each expert chose an item of their own, and the team could replace one of their own choices with the &quot;swap item&quot; if they wished to. The host, when offering the option to a team, would often ask, &quot;Swap or No Swap?&quot; Originally, the experts were given an unspecified amount of money to buy the extra item; the rule was later changed so that the experts could only use whatever money was left of the team&#x27;s £300 budget (the remaining money was referred to by Wonnacott as the &quot;leftover lolly&quot;). Under the revised rule, if a team used its entire budget, the expert could not choose a &quot;swap item&quot;.

The &quot;swap&quot; rule was changed again in 2006 (Series 14), becoming the &quot;bonus buy&quot;. The expert is still given any &quot;leftover lolly&quot; to buy this bonus item, which is entered into the auction. Just after the auction of their own items, and before that of the bonus item, teams must decide whether the auction results of the bonus item should be added to their own auction lots. Teams can potentially add to their profit with the bonus item, but it can also subtract from a team&#x27;s earnings if it loses money.

In a series in 2014, an alternative bonus item was purchased by the expert with &quot;Tim&#x27;s Ton&quot;, (£100 provided by Tim). The teams then had to decide on whether to select the &#x27;team&#x27;s bonus buy&#x27; (bought with the leftover lolly), Tim&#x27;s bonus buy (bought with Tim&#x27;s ton) or neither. Tim would also make his prediction as to which bonus buy would make the larger profit or smaller loss (which he called Wonnacott&#x27;s winner).

Series 52 in 2019 brought a change to the rules with two challenges, the &#x27;Big Spend Challenge&#x27; and the &#x27;Presenter&#x27;s Challenge&#x27; added. The teams have to spend at least £75 on one item, and buy an item relating to a specific category. Other changes include the contestants introducing themselves to camera, rather than to the presenter, and the bonus buy is now revealed to the contestants in the auction room after the sale of the first three items.

On average, the majority of contestants&#x27; items lose money: the teams are paying retail prices at fairs, whereas auction prices are generally lower. Large profits are fairly rare, though it is not particularly unusual for contestants to take home a small profit. Teams achieving the difficult feat of earning a profit on all three items are awarded a &quot;golden gavel&quot;; originally a wooden trophy, but latterly a lapel pin.

==Production==
Four or five programmes are usually made at each antiques fair and filming can take all day. Programmes are named after the locations where they are filmed.

Programmes are not necessarily broadcast in the sequence filmed, and one set of episodes can be split across different series.

==Bargain Hunt Famous Finds==
A separate celebrity version of the show premiered on 1 December 2008 on BBC Two featuring team pairs made up of one well-known personality accompanied by a friend or family member. The show is presented by Tim Wonnacott and the format is the same as the main show but Wonnacott&#x27;s visit to see an antiques collection or stately home is replaced by a feature where each celebrity contestant discusses antiques with him. Wonnacott might show them a borrowed collection of antiques brought along for the show that he believes would interest the celebrity (this may be related to the occupation of the celebrity), and in turn the celebrity shows Wonnacott an antique or collectable belonging to themselves. There is no suggestion of what to do with any profit if the teams make any, but most decide to give it to charity. Series 2 began on 30 March 2009 and ended on 3 April 2009.

===Celebrity contestants===
==History==
Originally a daytime show when launched in 2000 with game host David Dickinson. Later a primetime version, hosted by Dickinson, was also made (2002–2004), which was similar to the daytime show except that the teams&#x27; budget was increased to £500. It was on this version of the show that the record was set for the greatest profit earned on &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot;. A team led by Michael Hogben purchased a Royal Worcester box at Ardingly Fair for £140; the item made £800 in the live primetime auction.

When Dickinson gave up the daytime show to concentrate on the primetime version, his place was taken by Tim Wonnacott, an antiques expert already well known to UK viewers as a long-standing expert on the &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;.

In April 2005 it was announced that the primetime version of &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; had been axed; however the daytime version continued. Reruns of the daytime version (from the Dickinson era) also appear on BBC Entertainment and BBC America.

The show occasionally features well-known contestants, such as &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; stars Gorden Kaye and Sue Hodge.

The show airs on the Australian Foxtel and Austar cable television channel, Lifestyle, at 6.30 pm weekdays. The show also airs on the Seven Network&#x27;s digital station 7Two (Prime&#x27;s 7Two, in Regional Areas), weekdays at 11am and 6.30pm.

Several episodes recorded in late 2014 were presented by Anita Manning, Charlie Ross, Christina Trevanion, Natasha Raskin, Charles Hanson, and Paul Laidlaw whilst Wonnacott took part in the BBC 1 entertainment programme &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.

==Christmas charity single==

In December 2017, four of the &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; antique experts Charlie Ross, James Braxton, Charles Hanson and Philip Serrell got together to create a Christmas single in aid of BBC Children in Need. The single was released digitally on independent record label Saga Entertainment and peaked at number 1 on the Amazon Rock Charts, number 1 on the Amazon Rock Best Sellers and number 1 on the Amazon Hot New Releases chart. It was a rock cover of the classic Christmas song &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, written by Leroy Anderson &amp; Mitchel Parish. It was recorded at Metropolis Studios in Chiswick.

==Special programmes==
Following the death of expert David Barby on 25 July 2012, the programme paid tribute to him on 1 October 2012 by showing a montage of clips featuring his appearances on the show.

===500th programme===
On 15 October 2007, the 500th show was broadcast. This show differed from a normal show in that both teams were made up of experts – the red team featured David Barby and Philip Serrell (described as the &quot;old&quot; team), while the blue team featured Kate Bliss and Charles Hanson (deemed the &quot;young&quot; team); the &quot;bonus items&quot; were purchased by Tim Wonnacott himself. The teams were given £500 to spend, rather than the usual £300, with any profits going to charities chosen by the team members. The red team made a profit of £245, beating the blue team&#x27;s break-even. The show also featured out-takes and memorable clips from previous shows.

===10th anniversary===
The programme marked its tenth anniversary on air with a week of special editions broadcast between 15 and 19 March 2010. These followed a similar format to the 500th episode, except that the teams were given only the usual £300 to buy items, with a separate £100 per team allotted for the bonus items.

===20th anniversary===
The programme marked its twentieth anniversary on air with a week of special editions broadcast between 19 and 23 October 2020. Only some of the usual rules applied. The teams had one hour and £300 to buy three items to take to auction, shopping on their own, in a relay.

===BBC Music Day specials===
On 28 September 2018, &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; aired a special episode as part of BBC Music Day. The Red Team consisted of Bez and Rowetta from Happy Mondays and the Blue Team consisted of Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle from Pulp.

The Red Team won the episode by earning a profit of £8. However, it was later discovered that Bez&#x27;s girlfriend had bought two of the Red Team&#x27;s items. As it was and remains forbidden in the rules of the programme for friends and family of the teams to buy items the teams were selling, the Blue Team were made winners and Bez had to hand over £8 from his own pocket.

On 26 September 2019, the second BBC Music Day special was shown with The Darkness (lead singer Justin Hawkins and bassist Frankie Poullain) competing against Feeder (lead singer Grant Nicholas and bassist Taka Hirose) at the Stamford Meadows antiques fair in Lincolnshire.

===&quot;Doctors&quot; special===
Following the cancellation of fellow BBC Daytime series &quot;Doctors&quot; in 2024, &quot;Bargain Hunt&quot; aired a &quot;Doctors&quot; special. It featured four long-term cast members from the series: Dex Lee, Dido Miles, Sarah Moyle and Kia Pegg. It aired on 14 November 2024, which also marked the date when &quot;Doctors&quot;″ final episode was transmitted.

<doc id="673078" wikidata="Q354601" url="?curid=673078" title="Pernod (brand)">
<text>Pernod is an absinthe produced by Pernod Ricard released in 2005 based on the original Pernod Fils recipe.

Pernod Fils () was the most popular brand of absinthe throughout the 19th century until it was banned in 1915. During the Belle Époque, the Pernod Fils name became synonymous with absinthe, and the brand represented the &quot;de facto&quot; standard of quality by which all others were judged. In recent years, Pernod&#x27;s absinthe was reformulated and relaunched.

== Origins ==
The brand&#x27;s roots can be traced as far back as the 1790s. According to legend, it was during this time in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, that Dr. Pierre Ordinaire created a distilled patent medicine that would represent the earliest origins of the drink. The recipe then came into the hands of Henri Louis Pernod through the means of a business deal, and in 1797, he and opened the first absinthe distillery in Couvet, Switzerland.

Pernod later built a larger distillery in Pontarlier, France, in 1805. This set the stage that would cause the sleepy community of Pontarlier to eventually emerge as the home of twenty-eight commercial absinthe distilleries, and the world&#x27;s center of absinthe production.

== The golden age of absinthe ==
The popularity of the Pernod Fils brand surged in the decades that followed, its impressive market share spawning a string of knock-offs and imitators with deceptive brand names such as &quot;Pernot&quot;, &quot;Parrot&quot; and &quot;Pierrot&quot;, among others. In 1901, the original distillery was almost completely destroyed by fire. A new, larger and more modern distillery was built in its place. In its heyday, the Pernod Fils distillery was producing as much as 30,000 liters of absinthe per day, and was exporting its product around the world.
By 1910, France&#x27;s rate of absinthe consumption had topped some 36 million liters per year. With a temperance movement growing around the world, many prominent French politicians and scientists turned their interest to France&#x27;s &#x27;national drink&#x27;.

== Product attributes ==
Like most high-quality absinthes, Pernod Fils was produced by macerating herbs, including common wormwood, fennel, &quot;melissa&quot; and anise in a neutral spirit of agricultural origin (usually, wine) in a copper alembic where the mixture was then distilled, to produce a transparent liquor. Part of the distillate was then steeped with additional herbs, such as hyssop and the Roman wormwood, to produce a green-colored fraction that was then filtered and reunited with the main part. The coloration process was done primarily to impart additional flavor and aroma to the absinthe, but the ensuing light olive tint also had the added benefit of enhancing its visual appeal. The colored distillate was then reduced in strength, with the 68% ABV product representing the most popular version of the brand. The predominant flavor in Pernod Fils, like all absinthes, was primarily anise—a flavor commonly misidentified by anglophones as &quot;liquorice&quot;.

== Demonization and banning of absinthe ==
The sheer popularity of absinthe indirectly contributed to its own demise. The absence of a proper appellation of control and regulated production standards invited cheap, industrial versions of the drink into urban markets. These poor-quality absinthes appealed to alcoholics of low socioeconomic status and were commonly adulterated with a variety of toxic substances to make certain attributes (e.g., color) of these inferior brands more convincing. This opened the door for the detractors of absinthe to accuse the drink of being harmful and deleterious, making it a convenient scapegoat for societal ills. Scientists conducted studies involving the injection of pure common wormwood essence into small animals. Whilst these tests usually resulted in convulsions followed by the death of the test animals, these tests were flawed and unrepresentative of absinthe consumption. Despite pleas by absinthe distillers for quality regulations for the category, the enemies of absinthe pushed to ban the popular drink. By 1915, absinthe was banned throughout much of Europe and the world. All French absinthe distilleries closed their doors, which caused the demise of Pernod Fils in France.

== Post-ban years ==
Despite the crippling effects of the French ban and the subsequent World War I, Pernod Fils&#x27; absinthe did not completely disappear. Production was resumed on a smaller scale at the Banus distillery in Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain, where absinthe had never been formally banned. However, the drink never regained its former popularity, and by the 1960s, production of Pernod&#x27;s absinthe was ceased. Concurrently in France, the Pernod company began producing a &quot;liqueur d&#x27;anis&quot; (anise liqueur) in the years that followed World War I, and it is this product which has evolved over the decades into its familiar present-day incarnation. Modern-day Pernod &quot;liqueur d&#x27;anis&quot; is altogether different from its predecessor, being compounded from a modern, industrial process, being significantly lower proof (45% ABV vs 68% ABV) with a much different flavor profile, and bottled with artificial dye and sugar.

== Today ==
In 2001, following the relegalisation of absinthe in various markets, Pernod Ricard released an absinthe made from flavouring extracts and colourants claimed to be &quot;inspired by the old formula&quot;. Independent reviews however revealed the product to be far more similar to its contemporary cousin, Pernod liqueur d&#x27;anise, than the historic pre-1915 drink.

In 2005, Pernod&#x27;s absinthe was reformulated and relaunched in an effort to bring it closer to the original sold by its predecessor, Pernod Fils.

<text>October Films, Inc. was a major U.S. independent film production company and distributor founded in 1991 by Bingham Ray and Jeff Lipsky as a means of distributing the 1990 film &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot;.

A series of mergers and acquisitions began when Universal Studios (then a division of the Seagram Company) bought a majority stake in October Films in 1997. Universal then sold its shares to Barry Diller in 1999, who renamed the company USA Films and merged it with Interscope Communications and Gramercy Pictures. Vivendi then acquired USA Films, who in 2002 acquired Good Machine and merged it with USA Films, forming Focus Features.

<text>The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was a British policy document produced in July 1998 by the Labour Government that had gained power a year previously. Then Secretary of State for Defence, George Robertson, set out the initial defence policy of the new government, with a series of key decisions designed to enhance the United Kingdom&#x27;s armed forces.

Two of the largest defence procurement projects were excluded from the 1998 SDR, the Trident submarines and the Eurofighter. However the Trident system was essential to maintaining a credible nuclear deterrent, a policy adopted by Labour, and was already nearing completion. Likewise the Eurofighter was nearing production and withdrawal would lead to loss of considerable investment and severe penalties from the partner nations.

Its overall strategic conclusions were that the British Armed Forces should be able to respond to a major international crisis which might require a military effort and combat operations of a similar scale and duration to Operation Granby during the Gulf War. It also should be able to undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as in Bosnia) while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial deployment - which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air forces - if this were made necessary by a second crisis (as in Operation Veritas in Afghanistan). It would not, however, expect both deployments to involve warfighting or to maintain them simultaneously for longer than six months. The Armed Forces must also retain the ability, at much longer notice, to rebuild a bigger (pre-Options for Change) force as part of NATO&#x27;s collective defence should a major strategic threat re-emerge.

The next wholesale review of the British Armed Forces was the Strategic Defence and Security Review of 2010.

== Summary ==
; Harrier Force : Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm to merge their Sea Harrier force with the RAF&#x27;s Harrier GR7s to form &quot;Joint Force Harrier.&quot; This joint force was to operate from Royal Navy s or air bases as required.

; Aircraft carriers : The current three &quot;Invincible&quot;-class aircraft carriers were to be replaced by two new larger and more flexible aircraft carriers. These ships, the (known at the time of the review as CVF) entered service in 2017 and 2019.

; Mobility : To increase strategic transport six s were ordered, and four C-17 Globemasters were leased. The SDR also reaffirmed the need for a permanent strategic transport force and the Airbus A400M was selected in 2000. 

; Royal Navy fleet : The surface fleet force was reduced from 35 to 32 frigates and destroyers with the withdrawal of Batch 2 Type 22 frigates, 25 to 22 minehunters and the SSN attack submarine force was reduced from 12 to 10. The potency of the SSN force was increased by the decision to make all capable of firing the Tomahawk land attack missile (TLAM.) The SDR confirmed the purchase an initial batch of three submarines.

; Nuclear deterrent : The maximum capacity of the Trident missile system will not be exploited. Approximately 200 warheads will be maintained, reduced from 300. Further the last batch of missile bodies will not be procured, with a total of 58 missiles. The patrols of the &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class submarines will be limited to one vessel carrying a reduced warhead load of 48 (reduced from 96.) The SDR recommended acceleration of the retirement of the WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons.

; Army : The British Army was reorganised. Another important move was the establishment of the spearhead 16th Air Assault Brigade which includes the Army&#x27;s WAH-64 Apache attack helicopter force. This gave an overall deployable force structure of three armoured brigades, three mechanised brigades, and one airmobile brigade. A Joint Rapid Reaction Force was also established to provide the capability to deploy a brigade-sized force at short notice. The Army&#x27;s size in Germany was to be reduced but numbers increased by 3,300 overall. The eight armoured regiments of the Royal Armoured Corps were to be reduced to six larger ones, fielding 58 rather than 38 Challenger 2 tanks each.

; Territorial Army : The TA was to be modernised and enhanced to make it more readily deployable and usable, primarily through greater integration with the regular Army. Total numbers were to be cut from 56,000 to 42,000.

; Ground Based Air Defence : Ground-Based Air Defence would no longer be separated under the Army and the RAF, but consolidated under a single Joint Ground-Based Air Defence Command.

; Support helicopters : All of the services battlefield support helicopters (around 400) were combined to form the Joint Helicopter Command.

;RAF fast jet force : The number of frontline aircraft was reduced by 36 (two squadrons) but the MoD reaffirmed their commitment to the Eurofighter. The SDR identified the need for a replacement for the Tornado GR4 and initiated studies under the Future Offensive Air System project. The purchase of Meteor, Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles was confirmed.

; NBC defence : An integrated British Army and RAF force, comprising both regular and reservist elements would be formed to specialise in NBC defensive capabilities. This resulted in the formation of the Joint NBC Regiment in 1999.

==SDR New Chapter==
Following the September 11th attacks on New York and Washington the Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon announced that work would be undertaken on a New Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review. This reviewed again the UK&#x27;s defence posture and plans to ensure that the country possessed the right capabilities and the right forces to meet the additional challenges faced after 9/11. The review concluded;
:&quot;We need to look further into how we should allocate the investment which is needed, including, for example, to intelligence gathering, network-centric capability (including enhanced strike and Special Forces capabilities and unmanned aerial vehicles), improved mobility and fire power for more rapidly deployable lighter forces, temporary deployed accommodation for troops, and night operations. The significant additional resources made available to Defence in Spending Review 2002 will enable us to take this forward with the urgency that the 11 September demands.&quot;

The first mention of a post office in the village is in 1873. The post office national archives record the issue to Old Warden in April 1890 of a type of postmark known as a rubber datestamp. The village post office closed on 14 October 2008. It was one of about 2,500 compulsory compensated closures of UK post office branches announced by the Government in 2007.

St Leonard&#x27;s Parish Church is located in the village.

Francis William Bourdillon (1852–1921), poet, translator, bibliophile, and scholar was the son of Francis Bourdillon (1816–1912), vicar of Old Warden 1880–92.

The village is also noted for being the home of the Shuttleworth Trust, an organization committed to the preservation of transport artefacts – primarily bicycles, motor cars, and aeroplanes – produced in the early part of the 20th century. The corresponding collection is known as the Shuttleworth Collection. The estate also has buildings and gardens, and a small airfield from which many of the historic aircraft fly during the regular flying displays. The estate, museum, and airfield are open to visitors. The estate is also the home of Shuttleworth College founded in 1944.

==Governance==
There are seven elected parish councillors.
It is part of Northill ward for elections to the Central Bedfordshire Unitary Authority.

Prior to 1894, Old Warden was administered as part of the hundred of Wixamtree.
From 1894 until 1974 it was part of Biggleswade Rural District and from 1974 to 2009 in Mid Bedfordshire District.

Old Warden is within the Mid Bedfordshire parliamentary constituency, whose Member of Parliament is Alistair Strathern of the Labour Party.

==Education==

The majority of this community is in the catchment zone for Robert Bloomfield Academy. This same area is in the catchment area for Samuel Whitbread Academy, which has upper secondary and sixth form.

==Sport and leisure==
Both the Greensand Ridge Walk and the Greensand Cycle Way pass through Old Warden.

Old Warden Cricket Club play in the Bedfordshire Invitation League on a Saturday and Division 4 of the Bedfordshire County Cricket League on Sundays.

<text>Lindsay Marie Whalen (born May 9, 1982) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Minnesota Lynx of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA). Whalen played college basketball at the University of Minnesota, and led the team to its only NCAA tournament Final Four appearance in 2004. Selected fourth overall in the 2004 WNBA draft by the Connecticut Sun, Whalen played for 15 seasons in the WNBA with the Sun and the Lynx, and is considered one of the best point guards in WNBA history.

Whalen won two World titles and two Olympic gold medals with the United States women&#x27;s national basketball team, as well as four WNBA championships with the Minnesota Lynx. She retired from playing professional basketball at the end of the 2018 season as the WNBA&#x27;s career leader in games won (323). Whalen was voted into the WNBA Top 20@20 as one of the league&#x27;s top 20 players of all time in 2016, and was voted into The W25 as one of the league&#x27;s top 25 players of all time in 2021. Whalen was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2022 and the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2023.

In 2018, during her final season with the Lynx in the WNBA, Whalen became the head coach at the University of Minnesota, a role she held for five seasons. In November 2024, she returned to the Lynx as an assistant coach.

==High school career==
At Hutchinson High School in Hutchinson, Minnesota, Whalen was a four-time All-Missota Conference pick, and led her team to three consecutive conference basketball championships. She was also a four-time honorable mention All-State selection. She averaged 22.8 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists as a junior.

Whalen won a state title and placed 13th nationally with her club team, the Minnesota Jaguars. She was also an All-Conference selection in tennis and track.

The gymnasium has since been renamed in Whalen&#x27;s honor.

==College career==

The University of Minnesota women&#x27;s basketball program rose to national prominence during Whalen&#x27;s college career. The average attendance at women&#x27;s basketball games grew from 1,087 during her freshman season to 9,866 her senior year. She became Minnesota&#x27;s all-time leading scorer on January 25, 2004, against Michigan State, surpassing 1994 Wade Trophy Winner Carol Ann Shudlick. Whalen finished her career with 2,285 points, fifth best in Big Ten Conference history.

She was a two-time Wade Trophy Finalist (2003, 2004) and a two-time Naismith Award Finalist (2003, 2004). As a senior, Whalen was a Kodak All-American First Team, made the USBWA All-American Second Team, USBWA All-American Second Team and AP All-American Second Team. She was the first Golden Gopher to earn All-American honors in three different seasons and led Minnesota to its first-ever Final Four appearance in 2004, one of three straight NCAA Tournament appearances for Minnesota. The program had been to the tournament just once before her arrival.

In the postseason, Whalen was named NCAA Mideast Region MVP for the 2004 NCAA tournament and was a unanimous selection for All-Big Ten First Team in 2004, 2003 and 2002. She was a three-time Academic All-Big Ten (2004, 2003, 2002), won the 2004 and 2002 Fast Break Club Award. As a junior, she was a Kodak All-American First Team, USBWA All-American First Team and an AP All-American Second Team.

Whalen&#x27;s jersey number 13 was raised to the rafters, though not officially retired, by the University of Minnesota during a ceremony in January 2005 at Williams Arena.

==WNBA career==
Whalen was selected in the first round of the 2004 WNBA draft (4th overall) by the Connecticut Sun. Until 2005 when Minnesota teammate Janel McCarville was selected at number 1, she was the highest drafted WNBA player ever from the Big Ten Conference. The Minnesota Lynx made an unsuccessful pre-draft trade, sending Sheri Sam and Janell Burse to the Seattle Storm for Amanda Lassiter and the 6th pick in the draft in an attempt to get hometown hero Whalen. Connecticut picked Whalen before Minnesota could, and the Storm had two more pieces to their eventual championship team.

In her rookie season, she was selected to play in the historic WNBA vs. USA Basketball game at Radio City Music Hall. She led the Sun to the WNBA Finals in her first and second seasons, playing while injured in the 2005 Finals. The Sun lost both years in the Finals to the Seattle Storm and Sacramento Monarchs respectively.
In the 2008 season, Whalen led a young team to second place in the Eastern Conference. She was the MVP runner-up to Candace Parker. She was selected to the First Team All-WNBA for the first time in her career. In the playoffs, the Sun could not hold off the New York Liberty as they fell 2–1. Whalen led the league in assists with 5.4 per game.

On January 12, 2010, Whalen was traded to her native team, the Minnesota Lynx in a deal that also involved Renee Montgomery. She signed a multi-year contract extension with the Minnesota Lynx prior to the team&#x27;s August 12, 2010 matchup with the Los Angeles Sparks. Terms of the deal were not announced, per team policy.

In 2011, with a supporting cast of Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson, Renee Montgomery and rookie Maya Moore, Whalen helped lead the Lynx to its first WNBA Championship. The Lynx finished the regular season 27–7, good for the second best record in franchise history and best in the league. Playing alongside a healthy Seimone Augustus and rookie sensation Maya Moore, Whalen led the WNBA in assists with 5.9 per game. Whalen finished fifth in MVP voting and was named First Team All-WNBA for the second time in her career. In 2012, Whalen led the league in assists for the third time in her career, and led the Lynx back to the finals, where they lost to the Indiana Fever.
In 2013, the Minnesota Lynx acquired the rights to Janel McCarville via a three-team trade, and she and Whalen were reunited as teammates. On September 7, 2013, Whalen became only the second player in WNBA history to record 4,000 points, 1,500 assists, and 1,000 rebounds in her career, joining Becky Hammon. She also became the 20th player in league history to reach 4,000 points.

In 2015, Whalen was named a WNBA All-Star for the fifth time in her career while averaging 10.9 ppg and 4.3 apg. Midway through the season the Minnesota Lynx traded for Sylvia Fowles part of a three-team deal, strengthening their lineup as the Lynx made it back to the finals. The finals match-up was a rematch against the Indiana Fever, the Lynx would avenge their previous finals loss defeating the Fever 3–2 in the series, winning their third championship in five years.

During the 2016 season, Whalen&#x27;s minutes were limited to just under 30 minutes of playing time each game, she averaged 9.8 ppg while shooting a career-high in field goal percentage. The Lynx remained a championship contending team, finishing with a franchise best 28–6 record. With the WNBA&#x27;s new playoff format in effect, the Lynx were the number 1 seed in the league with a double-bye to the semi-finals (the last round before the WNBA Finals) facing the Phoenix Mercury. Prior to the playoffs, Whalen had signed a multi-year contract extension with the Lynx. The Lynx defeated the Mercury in a 3-game sweep, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the fifth time in six years. It was also Whalen&#x27;s seventh career Finals appearance, which is the most by any player in league history. The Lynx were up against the Los Angeles Sparks, making it the second time in league history where two teams from the same conference faced each other in the Finals due to the new playoff format. However, the Lynx were defeated by the Sparks in a hard-fought five-game series with a final score of 77–76 in Game 5. The game winning shot came down to Whalen, who with 3 seconds left passed the ball to Rebekkah Brunson off the inbound, immediately passing the ball back to Whalen, who then dribbled up to half court and missed the game winning shot attempt from half court as it hit the top of the backboard and missed the rim. Whalen was also included in the WNBA Top 20@20, the best players in the WNBA&#x27;s twenty years of activity.
In the 2017 season, Whalen missed 12 games due to a left hand injury. In August 2017, she underwent successful surgery to repair the fracture in her left hand and was ruled out indefinitely. She played 22 games and averaged 8.0 ppg during the season prior to the injury. Whalen returned in time for the playoffs on September 12, 2017, after recovering from hand surgery. She started in Game 1 of the semi-finals against the Washington Mystics. Whalen scored 2 points along with 2 assists in 17 minutes of play in a 101–81 victory. The Lynx defeated the Washington Mystics in a 3-game sweep, advancing to the WNBA Finals for the sixth time in seven years, setting up a rematch with the Sparks. This would be Whalen&#x27;s eighth career Finals appearance, adding to her already record-setting number total of Finals appearances in league history. The Lynx would avenge last season&#x27;s Finals loss defeating the Sparks in five games to win their fourth WNBA championship in seven years, tying the now-defunct Houston Comets for most championship titles.
Whalen wanted to retire in March 2018 but stayed on after a four-hour telephone conversation with Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve. She earned the head coaching job at the university in April, so her dual responsibilities resulted in a season that &quot;The New York Times&quot; called juggling and &quot;emotional whiplash.&quot; In August 2018, she announced she would retire from playing professional basketball after the completion of the 2018 season. The Lynx finished as the number 7 seed in the league with an 18–16 record, making it the first time in 8 years where they didn&#x27;t finish as a top 2 seed. They faced the rival Los Angeles Sparks in the first round elimination game. This would be Whalen&#x27;s final game as the Lynx were defeated 75–68; she scored 9 points in the loss.

==Jersey retirement==
On June 8, 2019, the Minnesota Lynx honored Whalen by retiring her No. 13 jersey that she wore from 2010 to 2018. The ceremony took place at the Target Center before the game against the Los Angeles Sparks. On August 23, 2019, the Connecticut Sun also honored Whalen by retiring her No. 13 jersey that she wore from 2004 to 2009. The ceremony took place at halftime in the Mohegan Sun Arena during the game between the Sun and the Las Vegas Aces.

==USA Basketball==
Whalen was invited to the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team training camp in the fall of 2009. The team selected to play for the 2010 FIBA World Championship and the 2012 Olympics is usually chosen from these participants. Whalen was selected to be a member of the National team representing the US at the World Championships held in September and October 2010. The team was coached by Geno Auriemma. Because many team members were still playing in the WNBA until just prior to the event, the team had only one day of practice with the entire team before leaving for Ostrava and Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Even with limited practice, the team managed to win its first games against Greece by 26 points. The team continued to dominate with victory margins exceeding 20 points in the first five games. Several players shared scoring honors, with Swin Cash, Angel McCoughtry, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Whalen, and Sylvia Fowles all ending as high scorer in the first few games. The sixth game was against undefeated Australia — the USA jumped out to a 24-point lead and the USA prevailed 83–75. The USA won its next two games by over 30 points, then faced the host team, the Czech Republic, in the championship game. The USA team had only a five-point lead at halftime, which was cut to three points, but the Czechs never got closer. Team USA went on to win the championship and gold medal. Whalen averaged 5.9 points per game.

Whalen was named by the USA Basketball Women&#x27;s National Team Player Selection Committee to compete for the US at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Whalen earned praise for her performance at the Olympics, especially for a critical stretch of play against Australia in the semifinal. Whalen earned her first Olympic gold medal as the U.S. women swept all eight games they played, with an average margin of victory over 34 points per game.

Whalen played for Team USA in the 2016 Summer Olympics and earned her second Olympic gold medal as they defeated Spain 101–72. In 2018, Whalen announced her retirement from USA basketball, citing the facts that she wasn&#x27;t absolutely sure that she would compete in the 2020 Olympics and the desire to give younger players an opportunity to have an Olympic experience.

==Overseas career==
In the 2006–07 and 2007-08 off-seasons, Whalen played in Russia for UMMC Ekaterinburg. From 2007 to 2012, Whalen played five off-seasons in Czech Republic for ZVVZ USK Prague. In the 2012-13 off-season, Whalen played in Turkey for Galatasaray and returned to Russia in the 2013-14 off-season to play for Dynamo Moscow with teammate Seimone Augustus. Since 2014, Whalen had played a couple off-seasons for AGÜ Spor in the Turkish League. In January 2016, Whalen was announced as a player for Yakin Dogü Universeti.

==Coaching career==

In April 2018, Whalen was hired as the new head women&#x27;s basketball coach at her alma mater, the University of Minnesota. Whalen continued to play for the Lynx until the end of the 2018 season while taking on these duties.

In Whalen&#x27;s first season she helped the team to a 21–11 record, as well as 9–9 record in the Big Ten, becoming just the fifth coach in Golden Gopher history to win 20+ games in their first season. The Gophers also spent 10 straight weeks in the AP Poll, their longest run since the 2005–06 season. On March 2, 2023, Whalen was fired as head coach following Minnesota&#x27;s first round loss to Penn State during the 2023 Big Ten women&#x27;s basketball tournament. In five seasons at Minnesota, she led the Gophers to a 71–76 overall record and 32–58 record in conference play.

On November 30, 2024, Whalen was announced as an assistant coach for the Minnesota Lynx.

<text>Morgan Creek Entertainment, LLC is an American film production company, former sales agent and investor, that has released box-office hits including &quot;Young Guns&quot;, &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;Major League&quot;, &quot;True Romance&quot;, &quot;Ace Ventura: Pet Detective&quot;, &quot;The Crush&quot;, &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; and &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. The studio was co-founded in 1987 by James G. Robinson and Joe Roth. Robinson leads the company as chairman and CEO. His two sons, Brian Robinson and David C. Robinson, run the day-to-day operations. The company name comes from Roth&#x27;s favorite film, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Their most recent film is &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot;, which was released on October 6, 2023.

Morgan Creek generally releases their films through larger studios while retaining the copyrights, and making autonomous decisions on home video and television rights. Their logo contains a stylized creek.

== Company history ==
Morgan Creek&#x27;s initial slate of films from 1988 to 1990 were released by 20th Century Fox, except for &quot;Renegades&quot; and &quot;Coupe de Ville&quot; which were released by Universal and &quot;Major League&quot; which was released by Paramount, and some home video releases of its early titles going to Media Home Entertainment. In 1991, beginning with &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, they shifted their distribution of new films, as well as their previous catalog titles, to Warner Bros., where they remained until early 2005. Later that year, beginning with &quot;Two for the Money&quot;, they released their newer films through Universal, though previous films were still handled in the United States by Warner.

In 1996, Morgan Creek tried to expand into animated feature film production. Only one, &quot;The King &amp; I&quot; was produced, and it flopped.

On July 11, 1997, Gary Barber announced that he would leave Morgan Creek, and he subsequently went on to start out Spyglass Entertainment. In 1998, Morgan Creek had a distribution deal with Warner Home Video to release its product through the Morgan Creek Video and the Morgan Creek DVD labels.

On October 8, 1998, Morgan Creek and Franchise Pictures entered into an agreement where Morgan Creek would distribute Franchise&#x27;s upcoming pictures domestically. On July 2, 2001, Morgan Creek Productions sued Franchise Pictures for allegedly breaching an agreement giving the company the right of first refusal on some films.

In October 2014, Morgan Creek sold the international distribution rights and copyrights to their films to Revolution Studios for $36.75 million. In September 2015, Morgan Creek began negotiating the sale of rights for the remaining territories, though they intend to retain remake and television rights to the &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;, &quot;Major League&quot;, &quot;Young Guns&quot;, and &quot;Exorcist&quot; franchises.

<doc id="673094" wikidata="Q2498324" url="?curid=673094" title="Polysyllogism">
<text>A polysyllogism is a complex argument (also known as &quot;chain arguments&quot; of which there are four kinds: polysyllogisms, sorites, epicheirema, and dilemmas) that strings together any number of propositions forming together a sequence of syllogisms such that the conclusion of each syllogism, together with the next proposition, is a premise for the next, and so on. Each constituent syllogism is called a prosyllogism except the last, because the conclusion of the last syllogism is not a premise for another syllogism.

== Example ==
An example of a categorical polysyllogism is:
:All good students will readily understand polysyllogisms
:All students of logic are good students
:Therefore, all students of logic will readily understand polysyllogisms
:But all people who read this web page are students of logic
:Therefore, all people who read this web page will readily understand polysyllogisms

This argument has the following structure:
:All A is B
:All C is A
:Therefore: all C is B
:All D is C
:Therefore, all D is B

Note two points: first, the makeup of a polysyllogism need not be limited to two component syllogisms. In fact, it can have any number of component syllogisms. Second, validity depends on all its parts. If any one is not valid then the whole polysyllogism is to be considered invalid.

An example for a propositional polysyllogism is:

:It is raining.
:If we go out while it is raining we will get wet.
:If we get wet, we will get cold.
:Therefore, if we go out we will get cold.

Examination of the structure of the argument reveals the following sequence of constituent (pro)syllogisms:

:It is raining.
:If we go out while it is raining we will get wet.
:Therefore, if we go out we will get wet.

:If we go out we will get wet.
:If we get wet, we will get cold.
:Therefore, if we go out we will get cold.

== Sorites ==

A sorites (plural: sorites) is a specific kind of polysyllogism in which the predicate of each proposition is the subject of the next premise. Example:

:All lions are big cats.
:All big cats are predators.
:All predators are carnivores.
:Therefore, all lions are carnivores.

The word &quot;sorites&quot; comes from , &quot;heaped up&quot;, from σωρός &quot;heap&quot; or &quot;pile&quot;. Thus a sorites is a heap of propositions chained together. A sorites polysyllogism should not be confused with the sorites paradox, a.k.a. the fallacy of the heap.

Lewis Carroll uses sorites in his book &quot;Symbolic Logic&quot; (1896). For example:

:No experienced person is incompetent;
:Jenkins is always blundering;
:No competent person is always blundering.
:Jenkins is inexperienced.

Carroll&#x27;s example may be translated thus:

:All experienced persons are competent persons.
:No competent persons are blunderers.
:Jenkins is a blunderer.
:Jenkins is not an experienced person.

<text>NFR-90 (NATO Frigate Replacement for 90s) was a multi-national programme designed to produce a common frigate for several NATO nations. However, the varying requirements of the different countries led to the project being abandoned in the early 1990s.

==Project==
The project sought to achieve economies of scale in the production of the next generation warship. Feasibility studies began in 1985 and reported that with a modularity in design, collaboration should be possible.

Arguments erupted in the design definition stage over such issues as the choice of a primary anti-ship weapon. France pushed its Exocet missile while the majority of the nations preferred the Boeing AGM-84 Harpoon. The United Kingdom in particular was uneasy about the absence of a close-in weapon system due to its experiences of being on the receiving end of Exocets during the Falklands War.

The collapse of the project was guaranteed by the withdrawal of the two largest participants, the US and UK. The US Navy was not happy with the final single mission design - the multi-mission s demonstrate what the US had in mind. The UK considered withdrawing from the project in 1988, but committed to it to guarantee work for its shipyards and defence equipment suppliers. However, the UK finally withdrew in 1989 fearing that the requirement for a replacement for its Type 42 destroyers would not be met by the new frigate.

==Successors==
France, Italy and the UK set up the Horizon CNGF project in 1992. This was a further attempt at collaboration that was only moderately more successful, with the UK eventually withdrawing and starting its own national project, the Type 45 destroyer. France and Italy are continuing with the Horizon project, although far fewer ships will be built than initially intended. Spain, Germany and the Netherlands agreed to develop a trilateral basic design, which should be built and finally developed by each nation by itself. Within the framework of this so-called &quot;Trilateral Frigate Cooperation&quot; Germany built the (F124), Spain the (F100) and the Netherlands the .

Australia&#x27;s AWD would be evolved from the Spanish F100 class.

<doc id="673100" wikidata="Q622848" url="?curid=673100" title="Castle Rock Entertainment">
<text>Castle Rock Entertainment is an American independent film and television production company founded in 1987 by Martin Shafer, director Rob Reiner, Andrew Scheinman, Glenn Padnick and Alan Horn. It is a label of Warner Bros. Entertainment, itself a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Rob Reiner named the company in honor of the fictional Maine town of the same name that serves as the setting of several stories by author Stephen King, which in itself is named after the fictional mountain fort in William Golding&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. The logo consists of a lighthouse.

Reiner and Scheinman already had a production company. They were friends with Shafer, who worked with Horn at 20th Century Fox at the time. Horn was disappointed at Fox and agreed to join the trio in forming the company. Horn brought along Padnick, who was an executive at Embassy Television. In Castle Rock, Horn became the CEO, Shafer ran the film division, Padnick ran television, and Reiner and Scheinman became involved in the development of productions.

The company was originally backed by The Coca-Cola Company, then the parent company of Columbia Pictures. Coca-Cola and Castle Rock&#x27;s founders jointly owned stakes in the company. Months after the deal, Coca-Cola exited the entertainment business, and was succeeded by Columbia Pictures Entertainment, Inc.

The then-new company, originally called Castle Rock Productions, was targeted to a minimum of 15 features over a 5-year period at a 3-picture a year pace, with support from then-Columbia Pictures CEO David Puttnam, following the box office success of the film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which was produced by Act III Communications (controlled by Reiner&#x27;s colleague Norman Lear; the film had been in production at Embassy when Lear sold Embassy to Columbia and Lear subsequently paid for production to continue).

Shortly after formation, Castle Rock appointed Nelson Entertainment, the company that owned the domestic home video rights to Reiner&#x27;s &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;The Sure Thing&quot;, and &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, to join a five-year, eighteen-picture joint venture; this was in addition to a pre-existing pact between Nelson and Columbia Pictures for a 3-year, 12-feature deal, in which Columbia Pictures would serve as the co-financing entity; Castle Rock would produce fourteen films, while Nelson produced four films themselves.

Under the deal, Nelson also distributed the films on video in North American markets, and handled international theatrical distribution, while Columbia Pictures, which Nelson forged a distribution deal with, would receive domestic theatrical distribution rights. Some of Nelson&#x27;s holdings were later acquired by New Line Cinema, which took over Nelson&#x27;s duty. Columbia Pictures, shortly after the company&#x27;s formation, thereafter had to re-invest with a substantial change in terms when accumulated losses exhausted its initial funding.

Reiner has stated that Castle Rock&#x27;s purpose was to allow creative freedom to individuals; a haven away from the pressures of studio executives. Castle Rock was to make films of the highest quality, whether they made or lost money. In 1989, Castle Rock was supported by another backer, Group W, a subsidiary of Westinghouse.

Castle Rock has also produced several television series, most notably the sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

=== Turner purchase, Time Warner ownership and absorption into Warner Bros. ===
In August 1993, Turner Broadcasting System agreed to acquire Castle Rock Entertainment, along with co-financing partner (and eventual Castle Rock Entertainment corporate sibling) New Line Cinema. The sale was completed on December 22, 1993. The motivation behind the purchase was to allow a stronger company to handle the overhead.

By 1994, Castle Rock Entertainment launched a foreign sales operation, Castle Rock International, and planned to produce 12 to 15 films annually. Castle Rock Entertainment also had aspirations to distribute its own films once its deal with Columbia Pictures expired in 1998. It was long rumored that Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s film projects could go to New Line Cinema when the deal expired.

Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner Entertainment in 1996. After a failed attempt to divest the company, Time Warner Entertainment integrated Castle Rock Entertainment into Warner Bros., and cut its production slate to five films per year. On June 27, 1997, Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s staff was reduced to 60 employees and Castle Rock International was folded into Warner Bros.

In January 1998, Warner Bros. and PolyGram Filmed Entertainment formed a deal to co-finance and co-distribute Castle Rock Entertainment films; that deal was taken over by Universal Pictures after the studio&#x27;s parent company Seagram merged with PolyGram later that year. The Warner Bros./Universal deal expired in 2000. On June 19, 2000, after the expiration of the Universal deal, Spanish player Telefónica Media took over its take in the Castle Rock production company. Castle Rock Entertainment also set up projects with Village Roadshow Pictures and Bel-Air Entertainment, two of Warner Bros.&#x27; key production affiliates.

On July 20, 1998, Castle Rock Television took over production of The WB&#x27;s midseason show &quot;Movie Stars&quot;, which was set to be in development at Studios USA. In 2001, Castle Rock Television had set up &quot;Mission Hill&quot; writers Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein with an overall deal, producing several projects, like an unsold family concept pitch at ABC.

In April 2002, Warner Bros. reduced Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s budget following a string of box office bombs. Castle Rock Entertainment fired 16 of its 46 employees, and Castle Rock Entertainment&#x27;s physical production and public relations departments, back-office duties, and remaining employees were absorbed into Warner Bros.

=== Relaunch ===
In May 2020, Rob and Michelle Reiner signed a deal with Warner Bros. Television Studios, and on October 1 of that year, it relaunched the company. On October 19, 2021, the feature division company was revived with a $175 million film fund under which the studio will develop, produce and finance new films for global audiences. Reiner will continue as Castle Rock CEO, with Michele Reiner and Matthew George serving as co-presidents. Castle Rock will produce films in a first-look deal with Warner Bros. on theatrical content, which has long been its home, in addition to their existing deal with Castle Rock television productions. In April 2022, Jonathan Fuhrman joined Castle Rock Entertainment as EVP and Head of Business Affairs. He will report to Rob and Michelle Reiner and Matthew George.

Following an additional $170 million investment from Derrick Rossi, Reiner announced his intention to relaunch Castle Rock through two films, one a sequel to his &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; mockumentary, and the other &quot;Albert Brooks: Defending My Life&quot; documentary, shopping both films at the 2022 Cannes festival.

== Ownership of the Castle Rock library ==
Warner Bros. owns the copyrights and overall rights to most of the pre-2010 Castle Rock films and television shows, with a few notable exceptions. Amazon MGM Studios under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) owns the worldwide home video rights (under license and currently distributed in physical home media by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment through Studio Distribution Services since July 1, 2020) to most of the pre-1994 films by virtue of the purchase of the pre-April 1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment/Epic Productions library via Orion Pictures (which had included, in part, the Nelson Entertainment holdings) in 1999. Sony Pictures owns the distribution rights to &quot;A Few Good Men&quot;, &quot;In the Line of Fire&quot;, and &quot;North&quot;, whereas its television division owns the distribution rights to &quot;Seinfeld&quot; and &quot;Thea&quot;.

<text>László Tőkés ( ; born 1 April 1952) is an ethnically Hungarian pastor and politician from Romania. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 2007 to 2019. Tőkés served as a Vice-President of the European Parliament from 2010 to 2012.

A bishop of the Reformed Diocese of Királyhágómellék of the Reformed Church in Romania, he is also a former honorary president of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania. An effort to transfer Tőkés from his post as an assistant pastor in Timișoara and to evict him from his church flat helped trigger the Romanian Revolution, which overthrew Nicolae Ceaușescu and spelled the end of communism in Romania.

Tőkés is the head of the Hungarian National Council of Transylvania, a civic organisation for Transylvanian Hungarians. He is closely associated with the Hungarian People&#x27;s Party of Transylvania (PPMT), but not a member of it. He is a member of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group, and co-sponsored the European Parliament resolution of 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism.

==Family==
A native of Cluj, László Tőkés is the son of István Tőkés, professor of theology and former deputy bishop of the largely Hungarian Reformed Church. He was married to Edit Joó, with whom he has three children: sons Máté and Márton, and daughter Ilona. Máté Tőkés, who was only three years old during the Revolution of 1989, later collected the memories of the friends, relatives, and other participants of the events, and in 2005 wrote &quot;Egymás tükrében&quot; (&quot;In Each Other&#x27;s Mirror&quot;), a book about his parents and the hardships of the family.

In March 2010, his wife filed for divorce. Edit Tőkés accused the bishop of &quot;numerous affairs&quot; and &quot;absurd habits&quot;. The claims of infidelity and mistreatment were confirmed by a former counsellor of the pastor and the divorce decree was issued in February 2011.

==Dissident pastor==
Like his father, Tőkés was a persistent critic of the totalitarian Ceaușescu regime. While a pastor in the Transylvanian town of Dej, he contributed to the clandestine Hungarian-language journal &quot;Ellenpontok&quot; (&quot;Counterpoints&quot;; 1981–82). An article there on human rights abuses in Romania appears to have been the occasion of his first harassment by the secret police, the Securitate. He was reassigned to the village of Sânpetru de Câmpie, but refused to go and instead spent two years living in his parents&#x27; house in Cluj.

His situation was discussed in the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which led indirectly to his appointment to be assistant pastor in Timișoara, where he gave sermons that opposed the Romanian national government&#x27;s program of systematisation, which proposed radical restructuring of the infrastructure of Romanian towns and villages. Smaller villages were deemed &quot;irrational&quot; and listed for reduction of services or forced removal of the population and physical destruction. This included the destruction of historic churches and monasteries. The programme was seen by Hungarians and human rights activists as a particular threat to Hungarian villages, although Tőkés&#x27; sermons did not single this out, calling for solidarity between Hungarians and Romanians. The governments of Hungary and West Germany, concerned for their national minorities in Transylvania, protested against systematization.

In the summer of 1988, Tőkés organized opposition to systematisation among Hungarian Reformed Church pastors, again drawing the attention of the Securitate. After the Securitate objected to a cultural festival organized on 31 October 1988 (Reformation Day), jointly with the amateur Hungarian-language theatre group &quot;Thalia&quot;, Bishop László Papp banned all youth activities in the Banat (the region Timișoara is part of). Tőkés nonetheless worked together with the bishop of the Romanian Orthodox Church on another festival in spring 1989.

On 20 March 1989, Tőkés gave a secretly taped TV interview to two Canadians – former politician Michel Clair and Radio-Canada journalist Réjean Roy (released as &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Shadow – The Real Story Behind the Romanian Revolution&quot;). The two were helped by a small group from Székesfehérvár in Hungary who smuggled in videotapes and video cameras.

On 31 March 1989, Papp ordered Tőkés to stop preaching in Timișoara and move to the isolated parish of Mineu. Tőkés refused the order, and his congregation supported him.

On 24 July 1989, the Hungarian State TV investigative show &quot;Panorama&quot; broadcast the secretly-taped TV interview with Tőkés. Two days later Bishop Papp sent Tőkés a letter, accusing him of slandering the state and saying lies in the interview, and ordered his expulsion.

The bishop began civil proceedings to evict him from his church flat. His power was cut off and his ration book taken away, but his parishioners continued to support and provide for him. The state had some arrested and beaten. At least one, Ernő Ujvárossy, was found dead in the woods outside Timișoara on 14 September, and Tőkés&#x27;s father was briefly arrested.

In the interview in July 1989, to Hungarian television, Tőkés complained that the Romanians do not even know their human rights. Tőkés explained the message and effect of this interview in a German TV series on the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 2008:
A court ordered Tőkés&#x27; eviction on 20 October. He appealed. On 2 November, four attackers armed with knives broke into his flat; Securitate agents looked on while he and his friends fought off the assailants. The Romanian ambassador was summoned to the Hungarian Foreign Ministry and told of the Hungarian government&#x27;s concern for his safety. His appeal was turned down, and his eviction set for Friday 15 December.

Foreign broadcasters also began showing the secretly taped TV interview, such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot; in the U.S.

==December 1989==
As 15 December approached, Tőkés&#x27; parishioners began something of a vigil outside his flat, refusing two guards&#x27; orders to move along. On 15 December, a human chain was formed around the block; the militia were unable to gain access. Tőkés thanked the crowd but advised them to leave, but several hundred stayed in groups close to the flat. His wife, Edit, who was pregnant at the time, fell ill. On 16 December, the family doctor appeared to see Edit. Within half an hour, the mayor of Timișoara appeared with three more doctors, hoping to persuade Edit to go to a hospital. On the advice of their family doctor, she refused.

Shortly afterwards, workmen arrived to repair the damaged windows and door to the flat; presumably the mayor was hoping to defuse matters, but the crowds actually grew, with some young Romanians joining the Hungarian parishioners. Tőkés spoke to the mayor and again urged the crowd to disperse. The crowd remained; the mayor stormed away, returned at noon, and promised that Tőkés would not be evicted. The crowd remained; some of them accused Tőkés of collaborating with the authorities and demanded a written retraction of Tőkés&#x27; transfer and eviction. The mayor promised to do so within an hour; if he actually intended to, it proved impossible on a Saturday.

After various negotiations with the mayor and the deputy mayor and the involvement of various delegations, the mayor gave an ultimatum for the crowd to disperse by 5 pm or face fire-brigade water cannons. Tőkés again pleaded with the crowd to disperse, but, possibly convinced that he was acting under threats from the Securitate, they refused. The crowd beckoned him to leave his apartment and come down to the street. He refused, presumably fearful of being seen as the leader of this resistance. 5 pm came and went without water cannons. By 7 pm the crowds extended for several blocks and included many students from the local polytechnic and university, Hungarians and Romanians in a human chain, first singing hymns, but about 7:30 launching into the patriotic song Deșteaptă-te, române! (&quot;Awaken thee, Romanian!&quot;), banned in 1947 at the beginning of the communist dictatorship and sung during the 1987 Brașov rebellion.

In Deletant&#x27;s words, &quot;The Hungarian protest had now become a Romanian revolt.&quot; Cries were raised, &quot;Down with Ceaușescu!&quot; &quot;Down with the regime!&quot; and &quot;Down with Communism!&quot; The crowd moved out from around Tőkés&#x27; flat and church, crossed a bridge, and headed for the city centre and Communist Party headquarters, where they threw stones before militia drove them back toward the church around 10 pm and the water cannons finally came into play. However, the crowd seized the cannons, broke them up, and threw the parts into the river Bega. A general spirit of roving riot ensued.

Demonstrations continued the next two days. On Sunday, 17 December, the army fired into the crowd. The number of casualties has been a matter of dispute; early reports were undoubtedly exaggerated. The number of deaths was 73 for the period 16–22 December 1989, and another 20 for the period after Ceaușescu fled. On Elena Ceaușescu&#x27;s orders, 40 of the dead were transported by lorry to Bucharest and cremated to make identification impossible.

On 18 December, tens of thousands of industrial workers in Timișoara peacefully took up the protest; by 20 December the city was effectively in insurrection.

The news of the protests and the violent government crackdown spread quickly across Romania and triggered many more protests. They quickly escalated into the Romanian Revolution of 1989 that overthrew Ceaușescu and the Communist government.

== Bishop of Oradea ==

After the dispossession of the discredited Communist bishop of Oradea, László Papp in 1989, Tőkés was elected as a bishop of the Reformed Diocese of Királyhágómellék. He was again re-elected in 2004 for another six-year term. During his tenure, he worked hard for the reorganization of the disintegrated church and the renewal of spiritual life. He emphasised the importance of Hungarian-language education, social responsibility, and missionary work. It was his top priority to win back the properties and schools of the church that had been confiscated by the Communist government, but ownership-restoration in Romania proved to be an extremely difficult, slow and—so far—unsuccessful process.

In spite of financial difficulties, he established new social and educational institutions instead of the old ones. The Christian University of Partium in Oradea was one of the bishop&#x27;s favourite projects as the first Hungarian-language private university in Romania (opened in 1999). His other notable initiatives are the child-care center in Oradea, an orphanage in Aleșd, Bethesda Health-Care Centre in Arduzel, Peter Reformed Elementary School in Salonta, and a nursing home in Tinca. The Lórántffy Zsuzsanna Ecclesiastical Centre of the Hungarian Reformed Church with a museum, auditorium, and social care centre was inaugurated in 1996.

==Political career==

In 2007 Tőkés ran for the European Parliament as an independent, receiving the backing of Hungary&#x27;s Fidesz. At the November 2007 election in Romania, he gained enough votes to win a seat. In competition with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania, the main party of Romania&#x27;s Hungarians, Tőkés was accused, for instance by a leading politician of that party, György Frunda, of splitting the Hungarian vote. Frunda also claimed that Tőkés was helped by President Traian Băsescu and noted that he received 18,000 votes from the historically named Wallachia and Moldavia regions of Romania, places where few Hungarians live. Tőkés commented on election night, &quot;I knocked out the Greater Romania Party&quot;, referring to the fact that, while he had won a seat, the far right, anti-Hungarian Greater Romania Party had lost all five of its own.

In the 2009 European Parliament election he headed the party list of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania and was re-elected. In May 2010, he became one of the fourteen vice-presidents of the European Parliament. He was elected by 334 votes in favour and 287 abstentions, replacing Pál Schmitt.

He is a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism.

In 2014 he was the third on the list of Fidesz for the European Parliament election in Hungary. Before his term ended in 2019, he announced that he would not run for re-election, stating that the European People&#x27;s Party had &quot;abandoned Christian Europe&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
In 1990 he received the Four Freedoms Award for the Freedom of Worship.

In June 2009, in Washington, D.C., he was awarded the Truman-Reagan Medal of Freedom for his role in the struggles against Romanian communism.

He received the Order of the Star of Romania from President Traian Băsescu in 2009. President Klaus Iohannis announced in 2016 that he decided to withdraw the honour from Tőkés. &quot;The matter reached my table and I have to make a decision. In my opinion, we should consider certain issues when analysing such questions. The one who grants a distinction wishes to reward the person distinguished, the one who receives and accepts the distinction must recognise Romania and the Constitution of Romania, to appreciate the values that stay at the grounds of the Constitution of Romania. Considering all this, I have decided to withdraw the &#x27;Romania Star&#x27; Order from mister László Tőkés,&quot; the head of state said at the Cotroceni Palace. Tőkés responded that the cause of the withdrawal of the award – a comment he made to Hungary&#x27;s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in 2013 about supposedly proposing to extend a &quot;protectorate status&quot; to Transylvania, similar to the status of South Tyrol based on the Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement – was mistranslated. His appeals in Romania were struck down by all judicial institutions by 2016, but Tőkés responded that he would challenge the decision at the High Court of Cassation and Justice and the European Court of Justice.

<text>The Humber College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, rebranded as Humber Polytechnic since 2024, is a public college in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. 

Founded in 1967, Humber has three main campuses and locations: the Humber North campus, the Lakeshore campus, and the International Graduate School. Today, Humber boasts over 200 programs, 86,000 full time students and 9,300 international students.

==Programs==
Humber Polytechnic offers more than 200 programs, including bachelor&#x27;s degree, diploma, certificate, post-graduate certificate and apprenticeship programs, across 17 areas of interest. Humber also provides academic advisors and resources, such as a career finder. Beyond this, Humber also provides Bridging (or Bridge Training) Programs for internationally trained professionals in the fields of engineering and information technology. 

Humber serves more than 86,000 learners.

==History==
Humber College was established in 1967 under its founding President, Gordon Wragg. The first new section of Humber opened on Monday September 11, 1967 at James S. Bell Elementary School, a public school on Lake Shore Boulevard West. The Lakeshore Campus began with the addition of the manpower retraining programs on Queen Elizabeth Way in Etobicoke. In November 1968, North Campus was officially opened by Mayor Edward A. Horton of Etobicoke and Mayor Jack Moulton of York. In the early 1970s, student enrolment was rapidly increasing which led Humber to expand its business and technology programs at both the North and Lakeshore Campuses. Humber had the largest group of business students in the province. Three year co-op programs were developed in the early 1970s in a range of technology and business programs. Humber became Canada&#x27;s largest college with over 27,000 full-time and 50,000 part-time learners.

By the early 1980s Humber was developing programs to respond to business and industry demands by focusing on flexibility in class schedules, including a weekend college. Its skill-based training courses included self-paced programming and, along with Holland College in Prince Edward Island, became one of the National Centers for industry driven DACUM curriculum. Humber introduced flexible manufacturing and was a pioneer in introducing computer applications in technology programs. Lakeshore Campus, at its new permanent location on the lakeshore, was the first college to introduce a solar technology program to respond to the needs of that growing industry of the time. Humber had a large international outreach program, working in over 20 countries. With the assistance of ADB, the Government of Canada (CIDA), it developed the largest international program of all of the Canadian colleges by 1987, introducing the concept of responsive tertiary education to countries throughout Africa and Asia.

In the fall of 1980, building F was used for filming of the film &quot;The Last Chase&quot; which was released the following year.
In 1983, the campus was used for filming of the first &quot;Police Academy&quot; film, which was released the following year.

After the mid-1980s, the college concentrated more on arts and applied arts programs and refocused its energy on internal processes rather than program innovation and on local rather than national or international activities. It is an Ontario Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning.
On February 2, 2009, Humber students became the first to contact an astronaut in orbit using an apparatus they built and operated. They made contact with Sandra Magnus at the International Space Station from a lab room at the school&#x27;s Rexdale campus.

On August 29, 2024, Humber College announced a name change to Humber Polytechnic, to better reflect the education model as “one that combines deep, theoretical learning with applied, hands-on experience to foster employability, not just employment for graduates.” However, the college&#x27;s official legal name remains Humber College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning.

==Academic faculties==
*Faculty of Applied Sciences &amp; Technology 
*Longo Faculty of Business 
*Faculty of Media, Creative Arts, and Design
*Faculty of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences and Innovative Learning 
*Faculty of Social &amp; Community Services
*Faculty of Health Sciences &amp; Wellness

==Campuses==
===Humber North Campus===

Located in northwest Toronto (formerly Etobicoke) adjacent to the Humber River, the Humber North Campus has approximately 20,000 full-time and 57,000 part-time students, 1,000 of them living in residence. The campus offers full-time and part-time programs in various fields including Business, Applied Technology, Health Sciences, Media Studies, Liberal Arts, Hospitality and Tourism. In addition to that, the campus also has an indoor pool and sauna, athletics facilities and a fully functioning spa. North Campus is home to the Funeral Service Education program, one of only two FSE programs offered in the province.

On April 18, 2015, Humber opened the Humber Learning Resource Commons (LRC) which serves as the new main entrance for the campus. The 264,000-square-foot building has six floors and features a student gallery and commons, a new library, enhanced student services, the Registrar&#x27;s Office, Student Recruitment, Student Success &amp; Engagement, the International Centre, the School of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences and administrative offices. The building was designed by B+H Architects and it cost $79 million to build, $74.5 million of which were funded by Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities.

The Donor Wall, located in the North Campus, was installed to acknowledge individuals and organizations whose cumulative contributions have reached or exceeded $10,000. The wall comprises a series of individual hexagonal tiles with four donor levels and integrated touch screens that provide a flexible, interactive component to student and teachers. As of March 2019, the wall displays more than 350 supporters who have donated to Humber since its opening in 1967.

The campus also includes University of Guelph-Humber, with a collaborative university-college partnership between the University of Guelph and Humber Polytechnic.

==== Barrett Centre for Technology Innovation ====
The Barrett Centre for Technology Innovation, located at Humber&#x27;s North Campus, is home to many applied research projects with diverse partners across multiple sectors. It builds on Humber&#x27;s expertise in areas such as automation, robotics, systems integration, user experience testing, applied research and work-integrated learning. Some of the key features include interactive technology zones, digital media studios, cutting-edge prototyping and makerspaces, open concept gathering spaces and demonstration areas for new products and technologies. The 93,000 sq. ft. centre cost about $27 million, $10 million of which were funded by The Barrett Family Foundation. The Government of Canada provided additional funding of $15.5 million from the Post-Secondary Strategic Investment Fund, and the Government of Ontario provided $1.55 million from the College Equipment and Renewal Fund for the purchase of key equipment within the building.
===Humber Lakeshore Campus===
Located along the shores of Lake Ontario, at Kipling and Lake Shore Blvd. W, Humber&#x27;s Lakeshore Campus located in New Toronto has approximately 7,200 full-time students, with 400 living in residence. The Lakeshore Campus sits on the large grounds of the former Lakeshore Psychiatric Hospital and Lakeshore Teachers College, in the west-end New Toronto neighborhood of Toronto (formerly Etobicoke). When leased by Humber, the college vowed to keep the historical site in good condition and enhance its park-like setting as an asset to the Southern Etobicoke community. The campus now consists of a number of cottage buildings and the more modern and now renovated Lakeshore Teachers College facilities that were extensively re-worked in the early 1980s. The L-Building was opened in 2011 at the Lakeshore Campus, as an addition to the cottages located around it. In May 2013, artist Harley Valentine&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Persephone&quot;, after the mythic Greek queen of the underworld, was installed in the front plaza of the L-Building. The Lakeshore Campus was used as the location of the Police Academy in the &#x27;Police Academy&#x27; film series.

===Humber Arboretum===
Located behind Humber&#x27;s North Campus, the Humber Arboretum consists of botanical gardens and natural areas surrounding the Humber River. This unique site is home to the Carolinian bioregion, the most diverse ecosystem in Canada, and boasts over 1,700 species of plants and animals. The Humber Arboretum covers approximately of the West Humber River Valley between Highway 27 and the 427, and is easily accessed from Humber College Blvd.

=== Queensway Campus ===
In 1968, Humber opened Queensway 1 Campus which was located at 56 Queen Elizabeth Blvd; however, it was later renamed Lakeshore 2 Campus in 1975. It was home to Funeral Service Education Program which was launched for the first time in 1968/69 academic year. The campus closed its doors in 1989 and the program was moved to the North campus as part of the Health Sciences Division.

=== Other locations ===
On September 25, 2019, Humber announced the decision to close its Orangeville campus at the end of June 2021 and launch a new International Graduate School in downtown Toronto.

The Humber Centre for Skilled Trades and Technology and the Humber Transportation Training Centre each operate from facilities near but separated from the North Campus, offering applied training in subjects such as construction trades and truck driving respectively.

===Sustainability===
On January 10, 2018, Humber Polytechnic&#x27;s Lakeshore Campus became the first college in Ontario to receive Fair Trade Campus designation from the Canadian Fair Trade Network (CFTN.) for its promotion of social and environmental sustainability and innovation. Recognized already as one of Canada&#x27;s Greenest Employers, achieving the designation is part of Humber&#x27;s five-year plan to make its campuses more sustainable.

On February 7, 2019, Humber Polytechnic&#x27;s North Campus has received Fair Trade Campus designation from the Canadian Fair Trade Network for its promotion of social and environmental sustainability and innovation.
=== Athletics ===
In 1968 Humber formally joined the Ontario College Athletic Association (OCAA). Humber started with just four varsity programs and endured the growing pains of a young athletic program. Since then the department has blossomed into one of the most dominant, not only in Ontario but in the nation. Humber has grown from four to twenty varsity teams, competing in every sport that the OCAA offers. The Hawks now have a men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team in basketball, volleyball, outdoor soccer, indoor soccer, rugby, baseball/softball, golf, badminton, cross country and curling.

In the Fall of 2016, Humber Athletics became the first program to win 500 OCAA medals. Two years later, the Hawks captured their 50th Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) national championship, becoming the first institution to reach the milestone.

Humber also contains one of the college system&#x27;s campus recreation programs. Campus Rec, as it is widely known, offers intramural and extramural teams as well as a number of off-campus events. Intramurals are on-campus leagues where students of various skill levels compete in sports ranging from soccer to ice hockey. Extramurals are competitive club teams formed at each college that compete against each other in a tournament league format. Campus Rec has recently introduced off-campus events where students can participate in leisurely excursions. These include mountain biking, skiing, curling, horseback riding, rock climbing, beach volleyball and the Time for War fitness course.

The fitness programs at Humber&#x27;s North and Lakeshore Campuses offer students, faculty and community members a number of ways to stay fit and lead an active and healthy lifestyle. After a major renovation in 2010, the North Campus fitness area has become one of the area&#x27;s finest. The facility has an aerobic studio, weight and cardio rooms, saunas, ping pong tables, showers, lockers and washrooms. Certified personal trainers are available to build programs, give guidance throughout workouts and help build nutritional guides. There are over 16 different classes offered ranging from extremely strenuous to light stretching depending on personal fitness level.

=== Clubs ===

Ignite, previously known as the Humber Students&#x27; Federation club (HSF), is a sanctioned group of active and enthusiastic students who want to engage and share their passion or hobby with the students of Humber and Guelph-Humber. Clubs must be social, cultural or interest-based. Some of the clubs that were sanctioned for the 2013-2014 school year included Beyond the Rainbow, Dance Company, Liberals Club, Good Deeds Club, Embassy Christian Community, Table Tops Gaming Club, Ministry of Magic Club, and the Vietnamese Students&#x27; Association.

The overall purpose of Ignite is to meet new people who share the same interests and to enrich the post-secondary experience of Humber and Guelph-Humber students.

=== Residence ===

Humber Polytechnic offers residences for students at the North and Lakeshore Campuses. The North Residence is located by the Humber Arboretum and features three interlinked buildings with both single and suite-style rooms. The Lakeshore Residence is located west of downtown Toronto and offers suite-style rooms. Both residences offer themed floors which include extended quiet floors, single gender floors and Living and Learning Communities. Additional amenities include study rooms, a community kitchen that can be used for group cooking, exercise room (North only), recreational space and laundry facilities.

=== Student union ===

IGNITE, formerly the Humber Students&#x27; Federation, is the official student government representing the full-time students at Humber Polytechnic and the University of Guelph-Humber. The elected students of IGNITE are members of key Humber committees to ensure that students are properly represented during all major discussions and decisions.

=== Outdoor Learning Lab ===

Humber Polytechnic has recently received funding to build an outdoor learning lab and naturalized play environment at one of its campus child care centres. The living lab will provide students and faculty in programs such as Early Childhood Education, Health and Fitness, and Sustainable Technology, with the opportunity to engage in meaningful studies of children&#x27;s play and learning in a naturalized environment.

== Facilities ==

=== Digital Broadcast Centre ===
This centre is home to Humber TV, Radio Humber and all newspaper, magazine and web production. Humber is the only GTA College with a CRTC campus instructional license and fully operational radio station, 96.9 Radio Humber.

=== Arts and Media Studio ===

The old Lakeshore Lions Arena at 300 Birmingham Street is now home to Humber&#x27;s Arts and Media Studio, and opened in 2010. The site is part of the Lakeshore Campus site.

<text>The archaeology of Israel is the study of the archaeology of the present-day Israel, stretching from prehistory through three millennia of documented history. The ancient Land of Israel was a geographical bridge between the political and cultural centers of Mesopotamia and Egypt.

Despite the importance of the country to three major religions, serious archaeological research only began in the 15th century. Although he never travelled to the Levant, or even left the Netherlands, the first major work on the antiquities of Israel is considered to be Adriaan Reland&#x27;s &quot;Antiquitates Sacrae veterum Hebraeorum,&quot; published in 1708. Edward Robinson, an American theologian who visited the country in 1838, published its first topographical studies. Lady Hester Stanhope performed the first modern excavation at Ashkelon in 1815. A Frenchman, Louis Felicien de Saucy, embarked on early &quot;modern&quot; excavations in 1850.

Today, in Israel, there are some 30,000 sites of antiquity, the vast majority of which have never been excavated.

In discussing the state of archaeology in Israel in his time, David Ussishkin commented in the 1980s that the designation &quot;Israeli archaeology&quot; no longer represents a single uniform methodological approach; rather, its scope covers numerous different archaeological schools, disciplines, concepts, and methods currently in existence in Israel.

== Archaeological time periods ==

=== Paleolithic period ===
==== Lower Paleolithic ====

The beginning of the Lower Paleolithic in Israel is defined by the earliest archaeological finds available. Occasionally, when new, more ancient sites are discovered, the boundaries of this period are redefined. Currently the most ancient site in Israel, and one of the earliest outside of Africa, is Ubeidiya, in the Jordan Rift Valley. Its age is estimated to be between 1.55 and 1.2 million years BP. Many stone tools of the Acheulean culture have been discovered there. Among the other sites from this period is the site at Daughters of Jacob Bridge, which has been dated to 790,000 BP, using paleomagnetism. Some of the earliest evidence of the use of fire and wooden tools has been discovered on this site.

It is estimated that the people who left the remains discovered on the two sites mentioned belonged to the species &quot;Homo erectus,&quot; although the human fossils found were too few and incomplete to make a positive identification possible. An additional site from the early Lower Paleolithic is the Ruhama Swamp in the northern Negev, which contains remains from the Oldowan culture.

Most of the sites from this period belong to the Acheulean culture, and on many of them remains of elephant bones have been found, together with tools made of flint and basalt. Additional important sites are Revadim, Tabun Cave in Nahal Me&#x27;arot Nature Reserve, a site near the city of Holon, and a site located near kibbutz Evron.

At the end of the Lower Paleolithic, between 400,000 and 250,000 BP, the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex emerged. The site near Lake Ram, in the Golan Heights, where the Venus of Berekhat Ram was discovered, probably belongs to this cultural horizon. This statue is considered, by some, to be the earliest artistic representation of the human form. One of the human fossils from this period is the Galilee Skull, part of a skull discovered by Francis Turville-Petre in Mugharet el-Zuttiyeh, in Nahal Amud, which is considered today to be the skull of a &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; or of an &quot;early Homo sapiens&quot;. Notable Acheulo-Yabrudian sites are Tabun Cave and Qesem Cave.

In December 2020, archaeologists from the University of Haifa announced the discovery at the Tabun Cave at the Mount Carmel site of the oldest known tool used for grinding or scraping, dating back about 350,000 years. According to researchers, this cobble belongs to the Acheulo-Yabrudian complex from the late Lower Paleolithic and was used by hominids for abrading surfaces.

In February 2022, archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority, led by Professor Ella Been, announced the discovery of a 1.5-million-year-old complete Hominini vertebra. According to the researchers, the fossilized bone belonging to a juvenile between the ages of 6–12 is the oldest evidence of ancient Hominini in the Middle East. This latest discovery has shed new light on the story of prehistoric migration. The lower lumbar vertebra, dated to the Early Pleistocene, differs in size and shape from a 1.8-million-year-old skull unearthed at Dmanisi in the Republic of Georgia. After this discovery, co-author Dr Omry Barzilai concluded that different human species produced the two artifacts.

==== Middle Paleolithic ====
This period has been dated to the years 250,000–45,000 BP. Fossils of Neanderthals and of Homo sapiens from this period have been discovered in Israel. The Homo sapiens remains found in Israel are the oldest anatomically modern human remains discovered in this region of the continent of Africa. It is yet unclear whether Neanderthals and Homo sapiens populations coexisted side by side, in this area, or replaced each other as the global climate shifted, as was common during the Pleistocene. Both used the same style of stone tools, identified as the Mousterian culture. Remains of this culture have been discovered all over Israel, in dozens of cave sites and open sites.

Judging by the size and content of these sites it seems the population living in the area of today&#x27;s Israel in that period was small. Groups were small and they subsisted on hunting, consuming the carcasses of dead animals and gathering plants.

Their preferred game was the Mountain gazelle, the Persian fallow deer, and the Aurochs. In cave sites that had been used as seasonal dwellings in that period dozens of buried human skeletons have been uncovered. The most famous ancient Homo sapiens skeletons are the ones discovered in Es Skhul cave in Nahal Me&#x27;arot and in Me&#x27;arat Kedumim (Kedumim Cave) in Lower Galilee; the most notable Neanderthal skeletons are from Tabun Cave in Nahal Me&#x27;arot, from Kebara Cave, near Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov, and from Amud Cave in Nahal Amud. Other important sites are Misliyah Cave and Sephunim Cave in the Carmel and several open sites in the Golan, in the Negev, and in the Coastal plain.

In February 2021, archaeologists from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Haifa University announced the discovery of six lines engraved on a 120,000-year-old aurochs bone near the city of Ramle in the open-air Middle Paleolithic site of Nesher Ramla. According to archaeologist Yossi Zaidner, this finding was definitely the oldest in the Levant. Three-dimensional imaging and microscopic analysis were used to examine the bone. The six lines ranged in length from 38 to 42 millimeters.

==== Upper Paleolithic ====

This period in Israel has been dated to between 45,000 BCE and 20,500 BCE, and its sites are associated with two cultural horizons: the Ahmarian culture and the Levantine Aurignacian culture. Some technological advancements were made in this period, including the introduction of new techniques for manufacturing flint tools, the invention of the bow and arrow, and the manufacturing of stone tools intended for grinding food and preparing dyes. Humans began making tools from animal bones and the use of seashells for decoration became widespread.

Parts of skeletons were discovered in various sites, but no cemeteries from this period were ever found. It seems that during this era the Neanderthals disappeared from Israel, as they were going extinct throughout the Middle East and Europe at the time.

=== Epipaleolithic period ===

In this era, bridging between the mobile bands of hunter-gatherers of the Paleolithic and the agricultural villages of the Neolithic, three different cultures existed in Israel: the Kebaran culture, dated to 18,000–12,500 BCE, the Kebaran Geometric culture, dated to 12,500–10,500 BCE, and the Natufian culture, dated to 12,500–9,500 BCE.

=== Neolithic period ===
The Neolithic period appears to have begun when the peoples of the Natufian culture, which spread across present-day Syria, Israel and Lebanon, began to practice agriculture. This Neolithic Revolution has been linked to the cold period known as the Younger Dryas. This agriculture in the Levant is the earliest known to have been practiced. The Neolithic period in this region is dated 8500–4300 BCE and the Chalcolithic 4300–3300 BCE. The term &quot;Natufian&quot; was coined by Dorothy Garrod in 1928, after identifying an archaeological sequence at Wadi al-Natuf which included a Late Levallois-Mousterian layer and a stratified deposit, the Mesolithic of Palestine, which contained charcoal traces and a microlithic flint tool industry. Natufian sites in Israel include Ain Mallaha, el-Wad, Ein Gev, Hayonim cave, Nahal Oren and Kfar HaHoresh.

=== Archaeological remains ===
In July 2022, archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of an 8,000-year-old &quot;Mother Goddess&quot; figurine at Sha&#x27;ar HaGolan archaeological site. Anna Eirikh-Rose, co-director of the excavation reported that the 20-centimeter long figurine covered by a bracelet with a red bottom was found broken into 2 pieces. It was sculpted in a sitting position with big hips, a unique pointed hat, what are known as &quot;coffee-bean&quot; eyes, and a big nose.

In June 2024, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) recently announced the discovery of a well-preserved shipwreck dating back 3,300 years. The wreck, found about 90 kilometers (55 miles) off Israel&#x27;s Mediterranean coast at a depth of 1,800 meters (1.1 miles), contained hundreds of intact Canaanite jugs used for transporting wine, food oils, fruit, and other goods across the Mediterranean. The wooden ship was discovered by Energean, a natural gas company operating several deep-sea natural gas fields in Israel&#x27;s territorial waters.

=== Chalcolithic period ===

==== Definition ====
Understanding of the Chalcolithic period in Israel and in the Levant is still far from perfect. It seems that Chalcolithic cultures appeared in the northern Jordan Valley around 4,800 BCE, and in the southern parts of this valley, and, particularly, in Teleilat el-Ghassul, around 4,500 BCE. Though no direct evidence to this effect is currently available, Chalcolithic civilizations may have spread from northern Israel to the south over several centuries during the first half of the 5th millennium BCE. Judging by evidence from the material culture, there seems to be no direct link between the Late Neolithic cultures and the early Chalcolithic cultures that replaced them in this region. The Chalcolithic period ended in Israel around 3,500 BCE with the rise of the Early Bronze civilization.

Chief among the Chalcolithic cultures of the Levant is the Ghassulian culture of the mid to late Chalcolithic. It might have been preceded by the Bsorian culture. The Ghassulian culture itself is made of several subcultures, one of which is the Beersheba culture.

==== Subsistence ====
Hundreds of Chalcolithic sites have been discovered in Israel. Their subsistence was based on farming crops: chiefly wheat, barley and lentils, and on livestock: sheep, goats, pigs and cattle. The livestock was also used for producing wool and dairy products. This is evident from the many butter churns, made of clay, and also from the large number of animal figurines that have been discovered on Chalcolithic sites. People of the Chalcolithic period were also the first in Israel to grow cultivated fruit-bearing trees, such as date palms, olive trees and pomegranates.

==== Industry and material culture ====
The Ghassulians were the first in the area to smelt and work copper. Settlements of the Beersheba culture, a late Ghassulian subculture, specialized in different types of industry. Bir Abu Matar produced copper and copper tools, artifacts and jewelry. Copper ore, imported from Wadi Feynan or from Timna, was ground and then cooked in ovens. It was then smelted in special furnaces made of compacted earth mixed with straw. The molten metal was collected in special clay bowls and cast into earthen molds that were shattered after the metal had cooled. The people of Bir Tzafad specialized in ivory carving.

People of the Chalcolithic era also produced a multitude of stone (flint) tools, chief among which were fan scrapers, used mainly for working leather. Bone tools - such as picks, needles, combs and sickles - were also in use.

==== Ghassulian art ====
Elaborate, multicolored, wall paintings, done on plaster, that were probably associated with Ghassulian religious practices, were discovered in the later Chalcolithic layers of Teleilat el-Ghassul, the layers associated with the Ghassulian culture. The painters employed elaborate techniques, including the use of rulers to draw straight lines, and produced works of high accuracy. Periodically, a new layer of plaster would be applied to the wall and covered in fresh paintings. Over 20 such layers were discovered on the walls of one of the houses.

The Ghassulians also produced ivory statuettes, often of naked women or bearded men, or using other motifs, for instance, birds. These statuettes had holes at the top and were probably meant to be suspended by a string. They include motifs found in artifacts from pre-dynastic Upper Egypt (Amratian and Gerzean cultures).

==== Trade ====
People of the Chalcolithic engaged in extensive trade. Copper ore for the Ghassulian copper industry was imported from Timna or from Wadi Feynan, in today&#x27;s Jordan. Basalt artifacts (sets of large, finely-crafted, basalt bowls) that were probably used in religious rituals were imported from the north, from the Golan or from the Houran. These sets of exquisite artifacts also indicate an early phase of social stratification in Chalcolithic societies, since they were only found in several of the houses, whereas in others similar sets made of clay were discovered. Ivory for making ivory statuettes was brought from Africa, marine shells - from the Mediterranean coastline, from the Red Sea and from the Nile Valley. The settlements also traded with each other.

==== Archaeological remains ====
In March 2021, archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of the partially mummified 6000-year-old remains of a child in the Cave of Horror. The skeleton, probably a girl aged between 6 and 12 under two flat stones in a shallow pit grave was revealed with the help of CT (CAT) scan. The burial dates to the Chalcolithic period. The child had been buried in a fetal position and covered with a cloth resembling a small blanket, wrapped around its head and chest, but not its feet. The burial was found along with 1,600-year-old Dead Sea scrolls. Fragments were Greek translations of the books of Nahum and Zechariah from the Book of the 12 Minor Prophets. The only text written in Hebrew was the name of God.

=== Bronze Age / Canaanite period ===

The Bronze Age is the period 3300–1200 BCE when objects made of bronze were in use. Many writers have linked the history of the Levant from the Bronze Age onwards to events described in the Bible. The Bronze Age and Iron Age together are sometimes called the &quot;Biblical period&quot;. The periods of the Bronze Age include the following:
* Early Bronze Age I (EB I) 3330–3050 BCE
* Early Bronze Age II–III (EB II–III) 3050–2300 BCE
* Early Bronze Age IV/Middle Bronze Age I (EB IV/MB I) 2300–2000 BCE
* Middle Bronze Age IIA (MB IIA) 2000–1750 BCE
* Middle Bronze Age IIB (MB IIB) 1800–1550 BCE
* Late Bronze Age I–II (LB I–II) 1550–1200 BCE

The Late Bronze Age is characterized by individual city-states, which from time to time were dominated by Egypt until the last invasion by Merneptah in 1207 BCE. The Amarna Letters are an example of a specific period during the Late Bronze Age when the vassal kings of the Levant corresponded with their overlords in Egypt.

==== Archaeological remains ====
In February 2023, the remains of two elite brothers buried with Cypriot pottery, food and other valuable possessions were found in a Bronze Age tomb in Tel Megiddo. Bioarchaeologists identified the early evidence of a Bronze Age cranial surgery called trepanation in one of the brothers. The study published in PLOS One reports that the younger brother passed away in his teens or early twenties, most likely from an infectious illness like leprosy or tuberculosis. The older brother, who died immediately after the surgery, had angular notched trepanation and was thought to be between the ages of 20 and 40. A 30-millimeter (1.2-inch) square-shaped hole was created on the frontal bone of the skull after his scalp was cut with a sharp instrument with a bevelled-edge.

=== Iron Age / Israelite period ===

The Iron Age in the Levant begins in about 1200 BCE, following the Late Bronze Age Collapse, when iron tools came into use. It is also known as the Israelite period. In this period both the archaeological evidence and the narrative evidence from the Bible become richer and much writing has attempted to make links between them. A chronology includes:
* Iron Age I (IA I) 1200–1000 BCE
* Iron Age IIA (IA IIA) 1000–925 BCE
* Iron Age IIB-C (IA IIB-C) 925–586 BCE
* Iron Age III 586–539 BCE (Neo-Babylonian period)

The traditional view, personified in such archaeologists as Albright and Wright, faithfully accepted the biblical events as history, but has since been questioned by &quot;Biblical minimalists&quot; such as Niels Peter Lemche, Thomas L. Thompson and Philip R. Davies. Israel Finkelstein suggests that the empire of David and Solomon (United Monarchy) never existed and Judah was not in a position to support an extended state until the start of the 8th century. Finkelstein accepts the existence of King David and Solomon but doubts their chronology, significance and influence as described in the Bible. Without claiming that everything in the Bible is historically accurate, some non-supernatural story elements appear to correspond with physical artifacts and other archaeological findings. Inscriptions such as the Tel Dan Stele and the Mesha Stele can be traced to a non-Hebrew cultural origin.

==== Origins of the Ancient Israelites – the Tel Aviv School ====

Following the collapse of many cities and civilizations in the eastern Mediterranean Basin at the end of the Bronze Age, certain local nomadic groups in eastern Canaan began settling in the mountainous regions of that land (the mountain ranges on both sides of the Jordan River, of which the western part is known today as the West Bank). In this period the Sea Peoples invaded the countries along the eastern shores of the Mediterranean, creating the Philistine city states along the seacoast of southwestern Canaan. Egypt lost its control of the land in the 12th century BCE – the exact date is currently being disputed, and this issue is closely linked to the Low Chronology / High Chronology dispute.

According to Israel Finkelstein, this tendency of nomads to settle down, or of sedentary populations to become nomadic, when circumstances make it worth their while, is typical of many Mid-Eastern populations which retain the knowledge of both ways of life and can switch between them fairly easily. This happens on a small scale, but can also happen on a large scale, when regional political and economical circumstances change dramatically. According to Finkelstein, this process of settlement on a large scale in the mountain-ranges of Canaan had already happened twice before, in the Bronze Age, during periods when the urban civilization was in decline. The numbers of settlers were smaller in those previous two instances, and the settlement-systems they created ended up dissipating instead of coalescing into more mature political entities, as was the case with the settlers of the early Iron Age.

In the early stages of this process, settlements had the form of nomadic tent-camps: a ring of stone houses surrounding an inner yard where the livestock was kept. Gradually, as the settlement evolved, that space was filled up with houses. The composition of animal bones found in successive archaeological layers also displays change over time, reflecting the change in lifestyle – nomadic societies raise many sheep and goats and very little cattle. As the settlement process progressed, the percentage of cattle bones found in animal bone deposits increased dramatically. Another characteristic of the early Israelite settlements is the absence of pig bones in excavated sites, which seems to be the earliest evidence of the development of an &quot;Israelite national identity&quot;, though it is, so far, not quite conclusive.

At the height of this process, in the 10th century BCE, the population of the areas that would become the early Kingdom of Israel and the early Kingdom of Judea (before these kingdoms began spreading into the surrounding lowlands) numbered around 45,000. In the 11th century BCE Shiloh probably served as a religious center and might have held some political power in the region. In the mid to late 10th century BCE an early Israelite state formation emerged (possibly the one referred to in the Old Testament as the Kingdom of Saul).

It has been suggested by Finkelstein that this early Israelite state—and not David&#x27;s &#x27;unified kingdom&#x27;, which he sees as a &quot;literary construct&quot;—had been the target of the campaign of Shoshenq I to Canaan, in the middle of the second half of the 10th century BCE. There is evidence of a large scale abandonment of settlements in the heartland of the Kingdom of Saul, as described in the Old Testament, around that time—in the land of the Tribe of Benjamin, just north of Judah, the area of Gibeah. This attack by Shoshenq I on the Israelite kingdom was, most likely, a response to this kingdom&#x27;s attempts to expand into the lowlands of Canaan (as evidenced by a series of destruction events of Canaanite cities in the north of Israel around that time), and a part of this Pharaoh&#x27;s effort to take control over Canaan.

The Kingdom of Judah was relatively small—maybe 5,000 people in the 10th century BCE—and had been a vassal of Israel at least since the early 9th century, when the powerful Omride dynasty had taken over that kingdom, and until Israel&#x27;s destruction by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the late 8th century BCE. The Old Testament is mostly a Judean creation, although it incorporates many traditions (and, possibly, texts) from the Kingdom of Israel. As such, it describes the history of these two kingdoms, in the Iron Age, from a strictly Judean theological perspective and its historical account is biased, though it becomes relatively reliable from the 9th century onward.

=== The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah ===

=== Persian period ===


=== Hellenistic period ===
Many archaeological sites in Israel have yet to be excavated, but many have been surveyed by archaeologists on behalf of the Israel Antiquities Authority. One such site dating back to the Hellenistic period is Horvat Geres (Arabic: &quot;Khirbet Jurish&quot;) near Tzur Hadassah.

=== Roman period ===

The Roman period covers the dates 63 BCE to 330 CE, from Pompey the Great&#x27;s incorporation of the region into the Roman Republic until Rome&#x27;s adoption of Christianity as the imperial religion. The Roman period had several stages:
* Early Roman period (including the Herodian period) 63 BCE to 70 CE
* Middle Roman period: 70–135 CE (Jewish-Roman wars period); 135–200 CE (Mishnaic period)
* Late Roman period 200–330 CE (Talmudic period)

The end of the middle Roman period marks the end of the predominantly Jewish culture of Judea, but also the beginning of Rabbinic Judaism through Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakai in the city of Yavne. Therefore, the late Roman period is also called the Yavne Period.

Prominent archaeological sites from the Roman period include:
* Masada
* Herodium
* Caesarea Maritima
In March 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery at the Ramat Gan Safari Park in Tel Aviv of two 1,800-year-old sarcophagi, ancient stone coffins dating to the Roman period. Researchers assumed that the sarcophagi belonged to high-status people buried near Safari Park. The 6.5-foot-long coffins were crafted with limestone mined and designed with Greco-Roman symbolic discs and flower garlands.

In May 2021, archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority led by Dr. Rachel Bar Nathan announced the discovery in the Ashkelon National Park of the remains of a 2,000-year-old Roman basilica complex dated to the reign of Herod the Great. The building had 3 sections, a central hall and two side parts. According to the excavators, big marble columns and capitals surrounded the main hall imported from Asia Minor in merchant ships. Remains of column capitals with plant motifs, some bearing an eagle were the symbol of the Roman Empire.

In August 2021, marine archeologists headed by Yaakov Sharvit from the Israel Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of 1,700-year-old coins weighing a total of 6 kg., dated back to the 4th century AD in Atlit. According to Sharvit, coins demonstrated that they were assembled and agglutinated because of oxidation of the metals.

In July 2022, marine archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) discovered a 1,850-year-old bronze Roman-era coin off the coast of Haifa. The coin, belonging to the reign of Emperor Antoninus Pius, depicted the Roman Moon goddess Luna (Greek Selene) and below her an astrological sign of cancer.

=== Byzantine period ===
The Byzantine period is dated 330–638 CE, from Rome&#x27;s adoption of Christianity to the Muslim conquest of Palestine. The transition from the Roman to Byzantine period coincided with the growth of extensive imperial funding to construct Christian religious institutions in the area, often by transforming the older pagan buildings. A third of the 40,000 objects recovered annually from archaeological digs in Israel attest to the ancient Christian presence in the area. In November 2017, archaeologists discovered a 1,500-year-old Greek dedication to a church, or possibly a monastery. The inscription was discovered between two modern houses, about a mile from the coast. According to a medieval Christian Georgian calendar, a four-line Greek mosaic inscription dated back to &quot;the 3rd indiction, year 292&quot;, which corresponds to the 6th century AD on the Gregorian calendar. Archaeologists thought they could have found remains from Azotos Paralios of the Byzantine period. In 2020, archaeologists from the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at Haifa University uncovered the 25-meter-long ship dating back to the seventh-century. The ship was built using the &quot;shell-first&quot; method, containing the largest collection of Byzantine and early Islamic ceramics discovered in Israel. A team of archaeologists led by Nurit Feig of the Israel Antiquities Authority discovered the 6th-century church remains belonged to the Circassians. The excavators also revealed painted floor mosaics showing geometric shapes, blue, black, and red floral patterns. The main parameters of the discovered church are 12×36 meter. In December 2020, archaeologists revealed the remains of 1,500 year-old Byzantine church (known as the Church of All Nations) and the foundations of a Second Temple-era ritual bath (also known as a mikveh). According to Dr. Leah and Dr. Rosario, Greek inscriptions were written on the church&#x27;s floor as : &quot;for the memory and repose of the lovers of Christ… accept the offering of your servants and give them remission of sins&quot;. In January 2021, archaeologists from Israel Antiquities Authority announced the discovery of tombstone dating back 1,400 years with Greek inscription by an employee of the Parks and Nature Authority at Nitzana National Park in the Negev desert. On the Christian woman&#x27;s stone named Maria these words were written: &#x27;Blessed Maria who lived immaculate life&#x27;. In 2021, archaeologist from Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) led by researchers Tzachi Lang and Kojan Haku found in the village of Et Taiyiba an engraved stone from the late 5th century from the frame of an entrance door of a church, with a mosaic Greek inscription. The inscription reads &quot;Christ born of Mary. This work of the most God-fearing and pious bishop [Theodo]sius and the miserable Th[omas] was built from the foundation. Whoever enters should pray for them.&quot; According to archaeologist Dr. Walid Atrash, Theodosius was one of the first Christian bishops and this church was the first evidence of the Byzantine church&#x27;s existence in the village of Taiyiba. In April 2021, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 1,600-year-old multicolored mosaic dated back to the Byzantine period in an industrial area. According to IAA archaeologist Elie Haddad, it was the first time that excavators revealed a colored mosaic floor in Yavne. In August 2021, Israeli archaeologists led by Yoav Arbel, have announced the discovery of Byzantine-era wine press paved with a mosaic along with an old coin minted by Emperor Heraclius. According to coin expert Robert Kool, one side of the gold depicted the emperor and his two sons, while the other side depicted the hill of Golgotha in Jerusalem. A Greek or Arabic inscription was engraved on the surface of the coins, probably with the name of the coin owner. According to Yoel Arbel, stone mortars and millstones were used to grind barley and wheat and very likely also to crush herbs and healing plants.

Findings from the Byzantine period include:

== Notable sites ==

=== Jerusalem ===
=== Ashkelon ===
Archaeological excavation in Ashkelon began in 1985, led by Lawrence Stager. The site contains of accumulated rubble from successive Canaanite, Philistine, Phoenician, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Crusader occupation. Major findings include shaft graves of pre-Phoenician Canaanites, a Bronze Age vault and ramparts, and a silvered bronze statuette of a bull calf, assumed to be of the Canaanite period.

=== Beit Alfa ===

One of the earliest digs by Israeli archaeologists, the Beit Alfa Synagogue is an ancient Byzantine-era synagogue, constructed in the 5th century CE, which features a three-paneled mosaic floor. An Aramaic inscription states that the mosaic dates to the time of Justin (thought to be Justin I; ruled 518–527 CE). Each of the mosaic&#x27;s three panels depicts a scene: the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the sacrifice of Isaac. The twelve names of the zodiac are included in Hebrew. In the center is Helios, the sun god, being conveyed in his chariot by four horses. The women in the four corners of the mosaic represent the seasons.

=== Carmel Caves ===
Misliya cave, southwest of Mount Carmel, has been excavated by teams of anthropologists and archaeologists from the Archaeology Department of the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University since 2001. In 2007, they unearthed artifacts indicative of what could be the earliest known prehistoric man. The teams uncovered handheld stone tools and blades as well as animal bones, dating to 250,000 years ago, at the time of the Mousterian culture of Neanderthals in Europe. In January 2018 it was announced that a fragment of an early modern human jawbone with eight teeth found at Misliya cave, Israel, have been dated to around 185,000 (between 177,000 and 194,000 years ago [95% CI]).
This could make it (as of 2018) the oldest dated early modern human remain found outside of Africa, possibly after Dali Man from China dated at around 260,000 years ago. Layers dating from between 250,000 and 140,000 years ago in the same cave contained tools of the Levallois type which could put the date of the first migration even earlier if the tools can be associated with the modern human jawbone finds.

=== Mamshit ===
Mamshit, the Nabatean city of Memphis (also known as Kurnub in Arabic), was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO in June 2005. The archaeological excavation at Mamshit uncovered the largest hoard of coins ever found in Israel: 10,500 silver coins in a bronze jar, dating to the 3rd century CE. Among the Nabatean cities found in the Negev (Avdat, Haluza, Shivta) Mamshit is the smallest (10 acres), but the best preserved and restored. Entire streets have survived intact, and numerous Nabatean buildings with open rooms, courtyards, and terraces have been restored. Most of the buildings were built in the late Nabatean period, in the 2nd century CE, after the Nabatean kingdom was annexed to Rome in 106 CE.

=== Old Acre ===

Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, Acre&#x27;s Old City has been the site of extensive archaeological excavation since the 1990s. The major find has been an underground passageway leading to a 13th-century fortress of the Knights Templar. The excavated remains of the Crusader town, dating from 1104 to 1291 CE, are well preserved, and are on display above and below the current street level.

=== Tel Rehov ===
Tel Rehov is an important Bronze and Iron Age archaeological site approximately five kilometers south of Beit She&#x27;an and three kilometers west of the Jordan River. The site represents one of the largest ancient city mounds in Israel, its surface area comprising 120,000 m2 in size, divided into an &quot;Upper City&quot; (40,000 m2) and a &quot;Lower City&quot; (80,000 m2). Archaeological excavations have been conducted at Rehov since 1997, under the directorship of Amihai Mazar. The first eight seasons of excavations revealed successive occupational layers from the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I (12th – 11th centuries BCE). The Iron Age II levels of the site have emerged as a vitally important component in the current debate regarding the chronology of the United Monarchy of Israel. In September 2007, 30 intact beehives dated to the mid-10th to early 9th century BCE were found. The beehives are evidence of an advanced honey-producing beekeeping (apiculture) industry 3,000 years ago in the city, then thought to have a population of about 2,000. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows of 100 hives. Organic material (wheat found next to the beehives) was dated using carbon-14 radiocarbon dating at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Also found alongside the hives was an altar decorated with fertility figurines.

=== Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva ===
A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Tel Be&#x27;er Sheva is an archaeological site in southern Israel, believed to be the remains of the biblical town of Be&#x27;er Sheva. Archaeological finds indicate that the site was inhabited from the Chalcolithic period, around 4000 BCE, to the 16th century CE. This was probably due to the abundance of underground water, as evidenced by the numerous wells in the area. Excavated by Yohanan Aharoni and Ze&#x27;ev Herzog of Tel Aviv University, the settlement itself is dated to the early Israelite period. Probably populated in the 12th century BCE, the first fortified settlement dates to 1000 BCE. The city was likely destroyed by Sennacherib in 700 BCE, and after a habitation hiatus of three hundred years, there is evidence of remains from the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Early Arab periods. Major finds include an elaborate water system and a huge cistern carved out of the rock beneath the town, and a large horned altar which was reconstructed using several well-dressed stones found in secondary use in the walls of a later building. The altar attests to the existence of a temple or cult center in the city which was probably dismantled during the reforms of King Hezekiah.

=== Tel Megiddo ===
A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Tel Megiddo comprises twenty-six stratified layers of the ruins of ancient cities in a strategic location at the head of a pass through the Carmel Ridge, which overlooks the Valley of Jezreel from the west. Megiddo has been excavated three times. The first excavations were carried out between 1903 and 1905 and a second expedition was carried out in 1925. During these excavation it was discovered that there were twenty levels of habitation, and many of the remains uncovered are preserved at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago. Yigael Yadin conducted a few small excavations in the 1960s. Since 1994, Megiddo been the subject of biannual excavation campaigns conducted by The Megiddo Expedition of Tel Aviv University, directed by Israel Finkelstein and David Ussishkin, together with a consortium of international universities. A major find from digs conducted between 1927 and 1934 were the Megiddo Stables – two tripartite structures measuring 21 meters by 11 meters, believed to have been ancient stables capable of housing nearly 500 horses.

=== Beit She&#x27;arim ===
Beit She&#x27;arim is an archaeological site of a Jewish town and necropolis, near the town of Kiryat Tiv&#x27;on, 20 km east of Haifa in the southern foothills of the Lower Galilee. Beth She&#x27;arim was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and Nahman Avigad in the 1930s and 1950s. Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE and include the remains of a large number of individuals buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Together with the images on walls and sarcophagi, the inscriptions show that this was a Jewish necropolis.

=== Gath ===

Tell es-Safi/Gath is one of the largest pre-Classical sites in Israel, situated approximately halfway between Jerusalem and Ashkelon, on the border between coastal plain and the Judean foothills (Shephelah). The site was settled from prehistoric to modern times, and was of particular importance during the Bronze and Iron Ages, and during the Crusader period. The site is identified as Canaanite and Philistine Gath, and during the Iron Age was one of the five main cities (the ) of the Philistines. The site was excavated briefly in 1899 by the British archaeologists Frederick Jones Bliss and Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister, and since 1996, by a team from Bar-Ilan University directed by Aren Maeir. Among the noteworthy finds from the ongoing excavations are the impressive late 9th-century BCE destruction level (Stratum A3), apparently evidence of the destruction of Gath by Hazael of Aram (see II Kings 12:18), a unique siege system relating to this event that surrounds the site (the earliest known siege system in the world), a 10th/9th-century BCE inscription written in archaic alphabetic script, mentioning two names of Indo-European nature, somewhat reminiscent of the etymological origins of the name Goliath, and a large stone altar with two &quot;horns&quot; from the 9th-century BCE destruction level – which while very similar to the biblical description of the altar in the Tabernacle (in Exodus 30), has only two horns (as opposed to four in other known examples), perhaps indicating a unique type of Philistine altar, perhaps influenced from Cypriot, and perhaps Minoan, culture.

=== Gezer ===
Tel Gezer is an archaeological site which sits on the western flank of the Shephelah, overlooking the coastal plain of Israel, near the junction between Via Maris and the trunk road leading to Jerusalem. The tel consists of two mounds with a saddle between them, spanning roughly . A dozen inscribed boundary stones found in the vicinity verify the identification of the mound as Gezer, making it the first positively identified biblical city. Gezer is mentioned in several ancient sources, including the Hebrew Bible and the Amarna letters. The biblical references describe it as one of Solomon&#x27;s royal store cities. R.A.S. Macalister excavated Gezer from 1902 to 1909 with a one-year hiatus in 1906. Major findings include a soft limestone tablet, named the Gezer calendar, which describes the agricultural chores associated with each month of the year. The calendar is written in paleo-Hebrew script, and is one of the oldest known examples of Hebrew writing, dating to the 10th century BCE. Also found was a six-chambered gate similar to those found at Hazor and Megiddo, and ten monumental megaliths.

=== Masada ===

A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001, Masada is the site of ancient palaces and fortifications in the Southern District (Israel) on top of an isolated rock plateau, or large mesa, on the eastern edge of the Judean Desert overlooking the Dead Sea. According to Josephus, a 1st-century Jewish-Roman historian, Herod the Great fortified Masada between 37 and 31 BCE as a refuge for himself in the event of a revolt. Josephus also writes that in 66 CE, at the beginning of the First Jewish-Roman War against the Roman Empire, a group of Judaic extremist rebels called the Sicarii took Masada from the Roman garrison stationed there. The site of Masada was identified in 1842 and extensively excavated between 1963 and 1965 by an expedition led by Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin. Due to the remoteness from human habitation and the arid environment, the site has remained largely untouched by humans or nature during the past two millennia. Many of the ancient buildings have been restored, as have the wall-paintings of Herod&#x27;s two main palaces, and the Roman-style bathhouses that he built. A synagogue thought to have been used by the Jewish rebels has also been identified and restored. Inside the synagogue, an ostracon bearing the inscription &quot;me&#x27;aser kohen&quot; (&quot;tithe for the priest&quot;) was found, as were fragments of two scrolls. Also found were eleven small ostraca, each bearing a single name. One reads &quot;ben Yair&quot; and could be short for Eleazar ben Yair, the commander of the fortress. Excavations also uncovered the remains of 28 skeletons. Carbon dating of textiles found in the cave indicate they are contemporaneous with the period of the revolt. The remnants of a Byzantine church dating from the 5th and 6th centuries CE, have also been excavated on the top of Masada.

=== Tel Arad ===

Tel Arad is located west of the Dead Sea, about ten kilometers west of modern Arad. Excavations at the site conducted by Israeli archaeologist Yohanan Aharoni in 1962 have unearthed an extensive early Bronze Age settlement that was completely deserted and destroyed by 2700 BCE. The site was then apparently deserted until a new settlement was founded on the southeastern ridge of the ancient city during the Iron Age II. The major find was a garrison-town known as &#x27;The Citadel&#x27;, constructed in the time of King David and Solomon. A Judean temple, the earliest ever to be discovered in an excavation, dates back to the mid-10th century BCE. An inscription found on the site by Aharoni mentions a &#x27;House of YHWH&#x27;, which William G. Dever suggests may have referred to the temple at Arad or the temple at Jerusalem. The Arad temple was probably demolished around 700 CE, which is before the date of the inscription.

=== Tel Dan ===

Tel Dan, previously named Tell el-Qadi, is a mound where a city once stood, located at the northern tip of modern-day Israel. Finds at the site date back to the Neolithic era circa 4500 BCE, and include 0.8 meter wide walls and pottery shards. The most important find is the Tel Dan Stele, a black basalt stele, whose fragments were discovered in 1993 and 1994. The stele was erected by an Aramaean king and contains an Aramaic inscription to commemorate his victory over the ancient Hebrews. It has generated much excitement because the inscription includes the letters &#x27;ביתדוד&#x27;, Hebrew for &quot;house of David&quot;. Proponents of that reading argue that it is the first time that the name &quot;David&quot; has been recognized at any archaeological site, lending evidence for the Bible account of David&#x27;s kingdom. Others read the Hebrew letters &#x27;דוד&#x27; as &quot;beloved&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot; &quot;kettle&quot;, or &quot;a god named Dod&quot;, (all of which are possible readings of vowel-less Hebrew), and argue this is not a reference to Biblical David.

=== Tel Hazor ===

A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2005, Tel Hazor has been excavated repeatedly since 1955. Other findings include an ancient Canaanite city, which experienced a catastrophic fire in the sometime in the 13th century BCE. The date and causes of the violent destruction of Canaanite Hazor have been an important issue ever since the first excavations of the site. One school of thought, represented by Yigael Yadin, Yohanan Aharoni and Amnon Ben-Tor, dates the destruction to the later half of the 13th century, tying it to biblical descriptions in Joshua which hold the Israelites responsible for the event. The second school of thought, represented by Olga Tufnell, Kathleen Kenyon, P. Beck, Moshe Kochavi and Israel Finkelstein, tends to support an earlier date in the first half of the 13th century, in which case there is no necessary connection between the destruction of Hazor and the process of settlement by Israelite Tribes in Cannan. Other findings at the site include a distinctive six chambered gate dating to the Early Iron Age, as well as pottery and administrative buildings dating to either the 10th century and King Solomon or, on a lowered chronology, to the Omrides of the 9th century.

=== Sepphoris ===

Excavations in Sepphoris, in the central Galilee region, six kilometers north-northwest of Nazareth, have uncovered a rich and diverse historical and architectural legacy that includes Assyrian, Hellenistic, Judean, Babylonian, Roman, Byzantine, Islamic, Crusader, Arabic and Ottoman influences. The site is especially rich in mosaics belonging to different periods. Major findings include the remains of a 6th-century synagogue, evidence of an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. A Roman villa, considered the centerpiece of the discoveries, which dates to the year 200 CE, was destroyed in the Galilee earthquake of 363 CE. The mosaic floor was discovered in August 1987 during an expedition led by Eric and Carol Meyers, of Duke University digging with Ehud Netzer, a locally trained archaeologist from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. It depicts Dionysus, the god of wine, socializing with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels. In its center is a lifelike image of a young lady, possibly Venus, which has been named &quot;The Mona Lisa of the Galilee&quot;. Additional finds include a Roman theater on the northern slope of the hill, and the remains of a 5th-century public building, with a large and intricate mosaic floor.
=== Gesher Bnot Ya&#x27;akov ===
Bnot Ya&#x27;akov Bridge is a 780,000-year-old site on the banks of the Jordan River in northern Israel currently excavated by Naama Goren-Inbar of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. First discovered in the 1930s, Bnot Ya&#x27;akov had been the site of several excavations that provided archaeologists with crucial information about how and when Homo erectus moved out of Africa, most likely through the Levantine corridor that includes Israel. &quot;One of the rarest prehistoric sites in the world,&quot; it featured a remarkable level of organic preservation that archaeologists had not encountered at any other contemporary site in Europe or Asia. In 2000, the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) charged the Sea of Galilee Drainage Authority (KDA) with causing &quot;serious and irreversible damage&quot; to the site. While the KDA had procured permission from the IAA to work in a limited area to alleviate the regular flooding of farmland in the adjacent Hula Valley under the supervision of an IAA inspector, bulldozers entered the site at night, damaging fossil remains, manmade stone artifacts, and organic material.

=== Ain Mallaha ===
Ain Mallaha, a Natufian village, colonized in three phases 12,000 to 9600 BCE, contains the earliest known archaeological evidence of dog domestication: the burial of a human being with a dog.

=== Qesem cave ===
In Qesem cave, 400,000 years old teeth very similar to modern human teeth were found.
== Archaeological institutions ==
During the last hundred years of Ottoman rule in Palestine, European archaeologists active in the region tended to be Christian, backed by the dominant European powers of the time and the Churches. With the transition from Ottoman to British rule over the land, the pursuit of archaeology became less political and religious in nature and instead took on a more purely historical and scientific character. After World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the British Mandate, archaeological institutions tended increasingly to be concentrated in the city of Jerusalem.

In 1913–1914 the Society for the Reclamation of Antiquities was established by the Yishuv&#x27;s intellectual elite. Among its founder were Avraham Yaakov Brawer, David Yellin and Aharon Meir Mazie. The Society changed its name to the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society in 1920 and later to the Israel Exploration Society.

The British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem began operating in 1921, after R. A. Stewart Macalister and Duncan Mackenzie of the Palestine Exploration Fund appealed to the British government for the establishment of a local antiquities authority. Macalister and Mackenzie expressed concern over the dangers posed to archaeological sites on account of the battles being fought throughout the land. Mackenzie was also wary of fellahin raiding archaeological sites and stealing artifacts.

The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Institute of Archaeology was founded in 1926. In 1934 Hebrew University opened its Department of Archaeology, which it considers &quot;the birthplace of Israeli archaeology&quot;. The Tel Aviv University Institute of Archaeology was established in 1969.

After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, the British Mandatory Department of Antiquities, housed at the Rockefeller Museum, became the Department of Antiquities of the State of Israel. In 1990 the Department of Antiquities became the Israel Antiquities Authority, an autonomous government authority charged with responsibility for all the country&#x27;s antiquities and authorized to excavate, preserve, conserve and administrate antiquities as necessary.

*Eilat Mazar (1956–2021) Granddaughter of Benjamin Mazar, proponent of the Modified Conventional Chronology, and discoverer of the Large Stone Structure, thought by Conventional Chronology proponents to be the palace of David

== New technologies ==
Israeli archaeologists have developed a method of detecting objects buried dozens of meters underground using a combination of seven technologies, among them echomagnetic soundings, radio transmissions and temperature measurements, able to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant objects such as pipes in the ground.

== Politicisation of archaeology ==
Archaeological research and preservation efforts have been exploited by both Palestinians and Israelis for partisan ends. Rather than attempting to understand &quot;the natural process of demolition, eradication, rebuilding, evasion, and ideological reinterpretation that has permitted ancient rulers and modern groups to claim exclusive possession,&quot; archaeologists have instead become active participants in the battle over partisan memory, with the result that archaeology, a seemingly objective science, has exacerbated the ongoing nationalist dispute. Silberman concludes: &quot;The digging continues. Claims and counterclaims about exclusive historical &#x27;ownership&#x27; weave together the random acts of violence of bifurcated collective memory.&quot; Adam and Moodley conclude their investigation into this issue by writing that, &quot;Both sides remain prisoners of their mythologized past.&quot;

As an example of this process, an archaeological tunnel running the length of the western side of the Temple Mount, as it is known to Jews, or the Haram al-Sharif, as it is known to Muslims, became a serious point of contestation in 1996. The tunnel had been in place for about a dozen years, but open conflict broke out after the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open a new entrance to the tunnel from the Via Dolorosa in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Palestinians and the Islamic Waqf authorities were outraged that the decision was taken without prior consultation. They claimed that the work threatened the foundations of the compound and those of houses in the Muslim quarter and that it was actually aimed at tunnelling under the holy compound complex to find remains of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, similar to previous accusations in the 1980s. As a result of the rumor, Arabs rioted in Jerusalem and then spread to the West Bank, leading to the deaths of 86 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers.

== Damage to sites ==
After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arab historic sites newly under Israel&#x27;s control received little research and were neglected. Anti-Muslim sentiment in Israel led to Muslim cemeteries being damaged, continuing into the 1960s.

From 1948 to 1967, the Jordanian authorities and military forces engaged in what was described as &quot;calculated destruction&quot; in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem. In a letter to the United Nations, Yosef Tekoa, Israel&#x27;s representative to the UN, protested Jordan&#x27;s &quot;policy of wanton vandalism, desecration and violation,&quot; in which all the synagogues in the Old City apart from one were blown up or used as stables. A road was cut through the ancient historic Jewish graveyard on the Mount of Olives, and tens of thousands of tombstones, some dating from as early as 1 BCE, were torn out, broken or used as flagstones, steps and building materials in Jordanian military installations.

On 10 June 1967, the Israeli army razed the Mughrabi Quarter in Jerusalem. As well demolishing more than a hundred homes of Muslim families and leaving hundreds of people homeless, this involved the destruction of historic sites. 

The Old City of Jerusalem and its walls were added to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 1982, after it was nominated for inclusion by Jordan. Noting the &quot;severe destruction followed by a rapid urbanization,&quot; UNESCO determined that the site met &quot;the criteria proposed for the inscription of properties on the List of World Heritage in Danger as they apply to both &#x27;ascertained danger&#x27; and &#x27;potential danger&#x27;.&quot;

Work carried out by the Islamic Waqf since the late 1990s to convert two ancient underground structures into a new mosque on the Temple Mount damaged archaeological artifacts in the area of Solomon&#x27;s Stables and the Huldah Gates. From October 1999 to January 2000, the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem opened an emergency exit to the newly renovated underground mosque, in the process digging a pit measuring and deep. The Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) expressed concern over the damage sustained to Muslim-period structures within the compound. Jon Seligman, a Jerusalem District archaeologist told &quot;Archaeology&quot; magazine that, &quot;It was clear to the IAA that an emergency exit [at the Marwani Mosque] was necessary, but in the best situation, salvage archaeology would have been performed first.&quot; Seligman said that the lack of archaeological supervision &quot;has meant a great loss to all of humanity. It was an archaeological crime.&quot;

Artifacts from the First Temple Period (c. 960–586 BCE) were destroyed when the thousands of tons of ancient fill from the site were dumped in the Kidron Valley and Jerusalem&#x27;s municipal garbage dump, making it impossible to conduct archaeological examination.

The 2011 annual report of the Israeli State Comptroller criticized Waqf renovations on the Temple Mount, which were carried out without permits and employed mechanical tools that caused damage to archaeological relics.

In 2012, Bedouin gold-diggers irreversibly damaged the walls of a 2,000-year-old well located under a Crusader structure at Be&#x27;er Limon, near Beit Shemesh.

<text>Corey Delaney Clark (born July 13, 1980) is an American singer. He is known for his highly publicized disqualification from the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot; and later allegations of a sexual relationship with then-&quot;Idol&quot; judge Paula Abdul, although an internal investigation by an independent counsel appointed by the Fox network found no cause to believe there had been a sexual relationship between the two. Clark is the older brother of WNBA player Alysha Clark.

==Early life and career==
Corey Clark was born July 13, 1980, in San Bernardino, California, to Duane and Jan Clark, two singers who met on the road in Nashville, Tennessee in early 1978 while following their own musical aspirations. Duane, an R&amp;B and disco singer who sang in San Bernardino nightclubs and opened for Al Wilson and B. B. King and recorded and performed with the James Last Orchestra and the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra, is of African American, Cherokee, Apache, and Blackfoot descent. Jan Clark, the Hungarian-Ukrainian, Jewish, Irish, French, Cherokee, and Algonquian great granddaughter of a Budapest concert pianist, met Duane in Nashville while she worked in nightclubs specializing in R&amp;B and Barbra Streisand. The multiracial nature of the Clarks’ relationship and of Corey&#x27;s heritage was a source of racial conflict for the family during the Clarks&#x27; early years in Lufkin, Texas, where Corey recalls a story his parents told him about; a December 1979 incident in which the couple were driving to church for a Christmas event, with Duane dressed as Santa Claus, when they were pulled over by a white police officer, who smashed one of the car&#x27;s tail lights, and told Duane he was being pulled over and arrested for driving with a broken tail light.

Less subtle was the racism at school, where Clark says he and his sister got into fights with schoolmates in the first grade who called them &quot;niggers&quot; and &quot;cottonheads&quot;. Adding to his sense of identity confusion was the fact that African Americans did not accept him either, and called him and his sister &quot;wiggers&quot;, on which Clark comments, &quot;It&#x27;s real unsettling when you’re young and don&#x27;t know which group you belong to.&quot; Today, Clark reflects on his multiethnic heritage with pride, and says he wishes more people were open-minded about interracial dating, saying, &quot;Our family could claim to be the ultimate melting pot,&quot; and that being of so many different ethnicities gave him the ability to &quot;adapt to any situation&quot;.

Clark&#x27;s interest in music was stimulated at an early age; his first clear memory was of his parents, his aunt Audrey, and his father&#x27;s band recording a demo tape in a Denver studio. Having attended concerts by Boyz II Men, TLC and Montell Jordan, he himself began singing at age 11, without any formal training, at school functions and concerts.

Clark received his first professional singing job when he was 13, when Debbie Byrd, a family friend and vocal coach who would later go on to work on &quot;American Idol&quot;, recruited him and his parents to be among the backup singers for Barry Manilow during a week-long appearance in Las Vegas. Although Manilow was not a favorite of Clark&#x27;s, he realized his dream during this engagement, saying, 

At age 14, Clark started and performed as the lead vocalist in an R&amp;B vocal group called Envy. The group also included the now-Grammy Award-winning singer Ne-Yo, Solomon Ridge and Ray Blaylock. Envy performed in several talent contests, and a few years later, won the grand prize at a Las Vegas amateur singing contest. Envy also opened major shows for major artists such as Mýa and Destiny&#x27;s Child, and performed during Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York. The group signed a recording deal in 2000, but nothing came of it, and it disbanded after eight years of performances.

Clark and his family moved to Nashville, and while working as a stage hand in 2002, Clark auditioned for the reality television music competition show &quot;American Idol&quot;; he has been described as &quot;one of the most impressive top ten finalists of the talent search&#x27;s second season&quot;. Clark names making it to the top 32 finalists during that season to be his proudest moment.

==&quot;American Idol&quot;==
===Performances===

===Controversies===
====Disqualification====

During the &quot;American Idol&quot; competition, &quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; revealed that Clark had been arrested at his Topeka, Kansas home on October 12, 2002, after neighbors called police after hearing a commotion within the residence, including a girl yelling. Police arrived and questioned Clark and his 15-year-old sister Alysha, after which Clark became confrontational with the officers. Clark alleges police misconduct in handling the matter, asserting that he was beaten by the officers, who ultimately wrestled Clark to the pavement and handcuffed him behind his back. After managing to get his handcuffed hands in front of him in the squad car, he was shown a taser and warned he would be shot with it if he continued to resist, at which point he relented. He was charged with misdemeanor battery on four police officers and his sister, and endangering the welfare of a child. However both Clark and his sister Alysha have denied that he ever hit her, and Alysha echoed her brother&#x27;s account of the way the situation transpired.

On December 4, days after Clark became one of the final 32 &quot;American Idol&quot; contestants, he was charged in Kansas District Court with resisting arrest, battery upon his sister, and criminal restraint. Clark ultimately pleaded &quot;no contest&quot; to &quot;obstructing legal process&quot; through a plea agreement, and was sentenced to six months unsupervised probation and ordered to pay $116.00 USD in legal costs. Clark states in his book, &quot;Initially no charges were filed against me, and I was refunded my $116.00 USD bond money after attending a November 11, 2002 court hearing back in Topeka.&quot; That December, after Clark had filled out his contracts for &quot;American Idol&quot; and was publicly named a semi-finalist on the show, the state district attorney elected to proceed with the case and filed charges against him.

According to &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s producers, Clark did not disclose his arrest record when joining the competition, although Clark maintains in his book &quot;American Paulatics&quot; that he spoke with them and with judge Paula Abdul about his legal troubles. Producers also explained that the background checks conducted on all contestants did not uncover his arrest because of a misspelling of Clark&#x27;s name in the police report. Clark maintains that this could not be true, as all background checks are conducted via social security numbers, which Clark had provided to producers in his contract. The producers disqualified Clark from further participation in the competition nine hours after the story broke.

Clark believes that he was punished not for causing conflict with producers behind the scenes. According to Clark, after he made it to the twelve finalists&#x27; round, he and the other finalists were unduly pressured by producers to sign a contract, using one of two attorneys handpicked by the producers for representation, or be disqualified from the show. Clark and his fellow contestants&#x27; position was that having the producers select an attorney for them was a conflict of interest, a conclusion they reached with the advice of Abdul, who had told Clark, &quot;Look, if you can get six of your fellow contestants to stand up with you and say, &#x27;We want our own attorney, we&#x27;re not rolling with this stuff you want us to do,&#x27; they will not kick off the rest of the cast.&quot; The other contestants decided to support him in standing up to producers, and consulted with Abdul&#x27;s lawyer, Howard Siegel, on her recommendation (though Clark maintains in his book that they did not know at the time that Siegel was one of Abdul&#x27;s attorneys). Two weeks later, producers began asking Clark about his arrest record, and dismissed him from the show.

====Relationship with Paula Abdul====
Two years later, Clark began making allegations about his relationship with Abdul. Clark stated in his E-book, &quot;They Told Me to Tell the Truth, So...: The Sex, Lies and Paulatics of One of America&#x27;s Idols&quot;, and in a May 2005 interview with &quot;Primetime Live&quot; that &quot;Idol&quot; judge Paula Abdul took him under her wing, beginning on December 12, 2002, and coached him on how to succeed in the competition, including helping him select the right songs, clothes, and hairstyle, in order to avoid the show&#x27;s &quot;exploitation&quot; of young hopefuls&#x27; careers like himself, and that this mentorship developed into a three-month-long sexual relationship.

Clark provided, as evidence of his relationship with Paula Abdul, a message that Abdul left on his voice mail, multiple eyewitness accounts of Clark and Abdul being intimate together in public places, accounts by Clark&#x27;s parents of Abdul calling their home looking for Clark, a bottle of prescription strength cough medicine prescribed to Abdul in Clark&#x27;s possession, and phone records of Abdul and Clark speaking to each other for several hours at a time during late night hours. Abdul dismissed Clark&#x27;s claims as lies, saying that she would not &quot;dignify Clark&#x27;s claims with a response&quot;, explaining, &quot;Not only do I never lie, I never respond to lies&quot;. The show&#x27;s other judges and some of the show&#x27;s former contestants also expressed disbelief of Clark&#x27;s claims, which Clark saw as an attempt by Abdul, the show, and the network to cover up the matter.

&quot;Idol&quot; producer Nigel Lythgoe, who was unimpressed with the evidence presented, called it &quot;shoddy journalism&quot;. Regarding Clark&#x27;s possession of Abdul&#x27;s phone number, Lythgoe said, &quot;And I know for a fact that a lot of the contestants have got Paula&#x27;s phone number and contact her and she contacts them. Paula&#x27;s the den mother. ... I don&#x27;t have a problem with that. She&#x27;s been a star and now she can help them and that&#x27;s more than Simon [Cowell].&quot; Lythgoe also addressed Clark&#x27;s claim that he sent Abdul a secret message by singing &quot;I owe it all to you&quot; on the show by explaining that the serenade was choreographed by the producers. Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.

Clark denies that the timing of his revelation was part of a marketing ploy, asserting, &quot;If I wanted publicity, I could have done it two years ago when they were first trying to defame my name.&quot; Clark states that Abdul and the producers engaged in a character assassination campaign that he could not afford to combat or ignore, and accused them of spreading falsehoods about him throughout the industry in order to ruin his career. Other former contestants who came to publicly back Clark&#x27;s claims included second season semi-finalist Nasheka Sidall, who, it was stated on &quot;Primetime Live,&quot; first heard &quot;whispers&quot; about the affair soon after her time on the show as a contestant, and fellow second season finalist Trenyce, who corroborated Clark&#x27;s claims on &quot;Showbiz Tonight&quot;. Clark also points to the fact in his e-book that his &quot;Idol&quot; roommates, Ricky Smith and Ruben Studdard, were never asked for their views on the validity of his claims, but that third season winner Fantasia Barrino was questioned as to her opinion about Clark&#x27;s allegations, which Clark saw as an attempt by Fox or its investigators to use Barrino&#x27;s following to bias the public against Clark. As Clark states:

In August 2005, after an internal investigation by an independent counsel appointed by Fox, which included interviews with Abdul, Clark and other witnesses, the investigators concluded that Clark&#x27;s claims of a sexual relationship &quot;have not been substantiated by any corroborating evidence or witnesses, including those provided by Mr. Clark, and Ms. Abdul expressly denies that any such relationship ever existed.&quot; The investigators further added that &quot;Ms. Abdul acknowledges that she had telephone conversations with Mr. Clark while he was a contestant. Their accounts of those conversations, however, differ greatly and no evidence was uncovered to resolve the conflicts in their accounts.&quot; The network announced that Abdul could continue her judging duties on future seasons of &quot;American Idol&quot;, adding, &quot;The line is whether it affects the outcome of the competition...It is the sanctity of the competition that is first and foremost.&quot;

In the fourth season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, there was a parody of Clark&#x27;s claims, in which judge Simon Cowell was alleged to be having an affair with himself. The parody was very close in plot to the &quot;Primetime Live&quot; story. Clark released a statement that the parody offended him, and was an &quot;insult to the intelligence of the viewer&quot;.

==Legal issues==

Clark was sued by Wal-Mart in April 2000 for passing more than $600 in bad checks. In May 2001, he was sued by a Topeka, Kansas grocery store where he allegedly passed a bad $50 check.

In June 2005, Clark was cited and released on a misdemeanor battery charge after getting into a food fight during breakfast in a hotel room with his record company manager, Laura Kathleen Troy, and their entourage, which escalated into food and dishes being thrown. According to Sacramento Police Sergeant Justin Risley, both parties suffered scratches on their arms, but Troy did not press charges, and both Clark and Troy left in a vehicle together. Clark later apologized for the incident, explaining that his dancers, management team and record label representatives were also involved in the food fight, but that after they had left to get cleaned up, he and his manager, who stayed to clean up the room, were the ones present when the police arrived.

In June 2006, Monica Rodriguez Gonzalez, Clark&#x27;s wife and mother of their child, Yeshua, filed for a domestic violence protective order.

In July 2006, Clark was arrested on suspicion of violating a court order and trespassing at his wife&#x27;s stepfather&#x27;s residence in Yuma, Arizona. Charges were not filed at his subsequent arraignment, due to a delay in getting reports from the sheriff&#x27;s office about the incident. On October 2, 2007, Clark pled guilty under a plea agreement to charges of felony aggravated harassment involving domestic violence for the trespassing offense, and was also placed on probation.

Clark filed a libel lawsuit on July 5, 2012, against MTV Networks for more than $40 million, saying that MTV News correspondent Jim Cantiello &quot;falsely attacked Clark as a liar and called for a boycott of his music&quot;.

==Album and music career==
Clark, along with the other second season finalists, recorded RCA Records&#x27; &quot;The American Idol Season 2: All-time Classic Love Songs&quot; soundtrack. Their version of the song &quot;What the World Needs Now is Love&quot; debuted at number six on the Hot 100 singles sales Billboard Magazine Chart, beating out Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s 1965 debut of the same song in at number seven. With singles charting at number one (&quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot;) and number six (&quot;What the World Needs Now is Love&quot;) that year, Clark and the rest of the second-season cast became the first act since Nelly to place two titles in the top ten of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles sales. In the May 17, 2003 issue of &quot;Billboard Magazine&quot; the soundtrack attained &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Soundtrack number-one spot, &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top internet Album sales at number fourteen, &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 hot shot debut at number two, and the single &quot;God Bless the U.S.A.&quot; remained at number one for three weeks. The soundtrack sold more than 500,000 copies domestically, giving Clark and his fellow second-season castmates Gold record status, as well as making them all number one artists on the Billboard Music Charts of May, 2003.

Clark&#x27;s first album, &quot;Corey Clark&quot;, was released on June 21, 2005. Although the making of the album was highly publicized, the final product received minimal promotion or radio play. Despite featured guest spots from The Black Eyed Peas and Scott Storch, consumers were generally unaware that the album was released and available to the market. Clark claimed that radio conglomerate Clear Channel refused to play his record due to threats Clear Channel received that all &quot;American Idol&quot; promotional and advertising dollars would be pulled from any station playing Clark&#x27;s record.
Clark signed a one album, press and distribution label imprint deal with Universal/Bungalo Records, making him the first &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant in history to release his own album under his own record company distributed by a major label. This helped him earn a larger share of the album royalties and profits, and made him a partner in the decision-making process into the creative development of the album.

==Other media appearances==
Clark made a guest appearance on the first episode of the sixth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;, as one of five possible new castmates to be chosen from in a &quot;15 More Minutes of Fame Reality Hunk Pageant&quot;. He was the second contestant to be eliminated from the competition. &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot; first season winner Maven Huffman was chosen as the new castmate. Commenting on his participation in that show, &quot;I’m here to let the world see and get to know who Corey Clark really is, as I&#x27;ve been heavily portrayed by the media to be a bad guy.&quot;

Clark also performed on and co-hosted the 2005 New Music Weekly Awards, on which he debuted a selection from his album &quot;Out of Control&quot;.

In 2005 Clark was a guest on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. In 2006, he appeared on &quot;Only in LA&quot;, and on &quot;Soul Train&quot;.

Clark also appeared on the cover of the March 31, 2003 issue of &quot;People&quot;; on the May 25, 2005 issue of &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot; magazine; and the August 26, 2005 issue of &quot;New Music Weekly&quot; magazine.

Clark appeared and was interviewed for the &quot;Nashville Auditions&quot; episode of &quot;American Idol Rewind&quot;, a syndicated repackaging of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

<doc id="673125" wikidata="Q4050372" url="?curid=673125" title="Sun Kil Moon">
<text>Sun Kil Moon is an American folk rock act from San Francisco, California, founded in 2002. Initially a continuation of the defunct indie rock band Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon is now the primary recording moniker of vocalist and guitarist Mark Kozelek. The project is named after the Korean super flyweight boxer Sung-Kil Moon.

Following the delayed release of Red House Painters&#x27; final studio album, &quot;Old Ramon&quot; (2001), vocalist and guitarist Kozelek began recording new material under the name Sun Kil Moon with bandmates Anthony Koutsos (drums) and Jerry Vessel (bass), alongside Geoff Stanfield and Tim Mooney. The resulting album, &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot;, was released in 2003 to critical acclaim. The project&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Tiny Cities&quot; (2005), was composed entirely of Modest Mouse cover songs.

In 2008, the band released its third studio album, &quot;April&quot;. Recorded as a three-piece by Kozelek, Koutsos and Stanfield, the album was well received and featured guest vocal appearances from noted indie rock musicians Will Oldham and Ben Gibbard.

Inspired by classical guitar music, Kozelek recorded Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Admiral Fell Promises&quot; (2010), as a solo act, and continued to record mostly alone on its follow-up, &quot;Among the Leaves&quot; (2012). In 2013, Kozelek released three studio albums under his own name before releasing Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Benji&quot;, in February 2014, to widespread critical acclaim and increased exposure, with the band releasing their seventh studio effort, &quot;Universal Themes,&quot; in 2015. Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood&quot;, was released in February 2017, which was followed by their ninth studio album, &quot;This Is My Dinner,&quot; in November 2018. The tenth Sun Kil Moon studio album, &quot;I Also Want to Die in New Orleans&quot;, was released in March 2019.

==History==
Following the dissolution of Red House Painters after the tumultuous release of their last album, &quot;Old Ramon&quot;, Kozelek released a handful of solo recordings before forming Sun Kil Moon in 2002. The initial Sun Kil Moon consisted of Kozelek with former Red House Painters bandmates Anthony Koutsos and Jerry Vessel, as well as bassist Geoff Stanfield of Black Lab and drummer Tim Mooney.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot;, was released in November 2003 by Jetset Records. It contains several songs concerned with true-life stories of deceased boxers, such as Mexican featherweight champion Salvador Sánchez, Filipino flyweight champion Pancho Villa, and also Korean boxer Duk Koo Kim. Two of the three boxers died at the age of 23; Kim died at 27. The album was well received by critics, garnering an overall rating of 84/100 on Metacritic.com.

The band&#x27;s follow-up &quot;Tiny Cities&quot; was released in November 2005 on Kozelek&#x27;s own label Caldo Verde Records. The album covers eleven songs by the indie/alternative group Modest Mouse. &quot;Ghosts of the Great Highway&quot; was re-issued as a double CD in February 2007 on Caldo Verde. The second disc features six bonus tracks, including a cover of &quot;Somewhere&quot; written by Leonard Bernstein.

Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s third studio album &quot;April&quot; was released in April 2008 and features guest vocals from Will Oldham and Ben Gibbard. The album was issued as a double CD, featuring a bonus disc of alternate recordings of album tracks. The album was met with further critical acclaim, including a 4.5/5-star rating from AllMusic and 4-star reviews from &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, and &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;.

&quot;Admiral Fell Promises&quot; was released on July 13, 2010, and whilst credited to Sun Kil Moon, only Kozelek plays on the record, on nylon stringed guitar, and vocals.

&quot;Among The Leaves&quot;, Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released on May 29, 2012. Tim Mooney, the band&#x27;s former drummer, died in June 2012.

Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Benji&quot;, was released in February 2014. The record met with critical acclaim, and was named in the Best of 2014 lists of &quot;Fact&quot;, Stereogum, Pitchfork, Rough Trade, Drowned in Sound, Tiny Mix Tapes, and the NME. Soundblab selected it as the best album of 2014.

Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s seventh album of original material, &quot;Universal Themes&quot;, was released on June 2, 2015. The album features contributions from drummer Steve Shelley, who previously collaborated with Kozelek on the album, &quot;Benji&quot;.

On July 20, 2016 it was announced that Sun Kil Moon would release a new double album, &quot;Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood&quot;, on February 28, 2017. The announcement was accompanied by the release of a new song, &quot;God Bless Ohio&quot;. The album was released on February 17, 2017 with Caldo Verde Records. Mark Kozelek subsequently toured Europe, South America, and the United States, both as a solo act and with Sun Kil Moon, to promote the album.

On November 1, 2018, Sun Kil Moon released their ninth studio album, &quot;This Is My Dinner&quot;. The following year, their tenth studio album was released, titled &quot;I Also Want to Die in New Orleans&quot;, named after the $uicideboy$ album &quot;I Want to Die in New Orleans&quot;. This album saw Kozelek working with Donny McCaslin and Jim White, the former being heavily present on David Bowie&#x27;s 2016 album, &quot;Blackstar&quot;.

==Boxing references==
Kozelek&#x27;s favorite sport is boxing, and the name Sun Kil Moon was inspired by that of boxer Moon Sung-kil. Kozelek discussed boxing and the murder of Agapito Sánchez four years after a fight he witnessed in a 2012 interview:
Several of the band&#x27;s songs are inspired by the sport, such as &quot;Duk Koo Kim&quot;. Duk Koo Kim was a Korean boxer who died after a nationally televised bout with Ray Mancini on November 13, 1982. Mancini is from Youngstown, Ohio, which is very close to Kozelek&#x27;s hometown of Massillon. The triumph of the local hero soon turned into a tragedy that included the suicide deaths of both Kim&#x27;s mother and the bout&#x27;s referee, Richard Green. The song &quot;Pancho Villa&quot; is named after the Filipino boxer known by that name, and also mentions Salvador Sánchez and Benny Paret.

<text>Karen Jane Wallace (born 25 September 1971), known professionally as Jessie Wallace, is an English actress. She made her acting debut in the television police series &quot;The Bill&quot; and rose to prominence for her role as Kat Slater on the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2000–2005, 2010–present). For her portrayal of Kat, she has won seventeen awards including Most Popular Newcomer at the National Television Awards and the British Soap Award for Best Newcomer in 2001, Most Popular Actress at the National Television Awards in 2003 and the British Soap Award for Best Actress in 2011. She also portrayed the role of Pat Phoenix in the BBC Four television film &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, for which she was nominated for the 2011 BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actress.

==Early life==
Karen Jane Wallace was born on 25 September 1971 in the London Borough of Enfield to James Wallace, a telecommunications engineer, and his wife Annette (&quot;née&quot; Leach), a secretary. Wallace is of Irish ancestry, by way of Cork and Dublin. Her parents divorced when she was aged three and she and her sister were raised by their father, however she would see her mother at weekends. She adopted her stage name after her late grandmother.

==Career==
After schooling, Wallace trained as a make-up artist at the College of North East London in Tottenham and worked at the Royal Shakespeare Company for two years. She met and became friends with actor Iain Glen, who helped her apply for London drama college The Poor School, from which she graduated in 1999. While undertaking auditions – including for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, she worked as a barmaid at her local pub, The Royal Oak in Loughton, Essex. Her first television appearance was in an episode of the ITV police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot; in 1999 as P.C. Karen Lace.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
Wallace is known for playing the role of Kat Slater in BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She initially portrayed the role between September 2000 and December 2005. In 2007, Wallace said she hadn&#x27;t ruled out a return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In February 2010, it was announced that Shane Richie was returning to play Alfie Moon, leading to large amounts of speculation as to whether Wallace would also be returning. On 9 February 2010, the BBC confirmed that Jessie would be returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, reprising her role as Kat Slater. Kat and Alfie&#x27;s return scenes aired in September 2010.

In April 2015, the BBC announced that Wallace and Richie would depart from the show temporarily to appear in a six-part BBC One drama series, &quot;Kat &amp; Alfie: Redwater&quot;. In the series, Kat and Alfie visited Ireland in the &quot;search for answers to some very big questions&quot;. Speaking about the show, Wallace commented: &quot;I have always loved working on &quot;EastEnders&quot; so when I heard of this new drama to take Kat and Alfie outside of Walford, I couldn’t believe our luck. To be exploring the next chapter for Kat as well as working alongside my best mate, Shane, is a dream come true and a huge compliment.&quot; However, Wallace and Richie later revealed on &quot;This Morning&quot; in January 2016 that Kat and Alfie would not be returning to &quot;EastEnders&quot; after the six-part drama, and the characters departed at the end of that month. In December 2017, it was announced that Wallace would reprise the role of Kat in &quot;EastEnders&quot; the following year, and she returned to the show permanently in March 2018.

===Other work===

During her break from &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Wallace made television guest appearances, including once as Kat Slater, in the 2005 &quot;French &amp; Saunders&quot; Christmas special. In February 2006, Wallace was the guest host of an edition of the Channel 4 programme &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;. In 2007, she appeared in the one-off BBC One television dramas &quot;A Class Apart&quot; opposite Nathaniel Parker, and &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; with Lee Evans and Alison Steadman. After visiting Hat Trick Productions with her agent, and singing an impromptu version of Marie Lloyd&#x27;s song &quot;The Boy I Love is Up in the Gallery&quot;, she was offered the lead role in &quot;Miss Marie Lloyd – Queen of The Music Hall&quot; for BBC Four.

Wallace made her West End theatre debut, replacing Denise van Outen in the role of Maureen in &quot;Rent remixed&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre from 27 December 2007 until 2 February 2008. Wallace played Amy Kriel in the third series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; and starred in a run of the play &quot;Haunted&quot; at the Arts Theatre from 24 May.

Wallace competed with partner Darren Bennett in the sixth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; which began on 20 September 2008. They were the fourth couple to be eliminated from the competition in week 4.

Wallace toured the UK in the 25th Anniversary production of &quot;Stepping Out&quot; by Richard Harris, playing the role of Sylvia. Wallace appeared as Pat Phoenix in &quot;The Road to Coronation Street&quot;, a one-off drama exploring the origins and conception of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, to mark the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary in December 2010.

In 2014, Wallace reprised her role as Marie Lloyd in the music video for Tim Arnold&#x27;s single &quot;The Piccadilly Trot&quot;. She later appeared on Arnold&#x27;s album &quot;The Soho Hobo&quot; on a duet that he wrote called &quot;Soho Sunset&quot;.

In May 2015, Wallace performed a duet at Soho Theatre with singer-songwriter Tim Arnold to mark the release of his album &quot;The Soho Hobo&quot;. The song marks her first recording on a pop album and was written especially for her by Arnold. Wallace was also cast as the Fairy Godmother in the White Rock Theatre production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In July 2015 it was announced that Wallace would appear alongside Richie in a stage adaptation of &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot; by Peter James at the Theatre Royal in February 2016.

Wallace is a patron of the theatre charity The Music Hall Guild of Great Britain and America.

==Personal life==
When she began appearing in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Wallace&#x27;s personal life became the focus of many tabloid newspapers. She entered the soap cast in the later stages of a three-year relationship with Majorca based ex-criminal, Paul Whitworth. After being warned by BBC executives, she split with Whitworth, and had a holiday romance with 25-year-old American, Andy Burton, who immediately sold his story.

In November 2003, Wallace was suspended from &quot;EastEnders&quot; by the BBC for excess drinking, partying and adverse publicity; she returned to the soap, but was then stopped by police and arrested for drink driving, being one and half times over the limit. The BBC offered her counselling and while attending county court for sentencing, she was accompanied by a policeman, Dave Morgan, in case she was accosted by fans. The couple started dating, and then moved in together after Wallace confirmed she was pregnant. Wallace gave birth to daughter Tallulah Lilac on 2 November 2004, but the couple split up shortly afterwards, with Wallace&#x27;s lawyers placing a gag order on Morgan.

In a tabloid story that surfaced in September 2007, whilst Wallace was filming &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; in Johannesburg with her cousin Jonathan and daughter Tallulah, her best friend, Stefan, suggested she still regularly took ketamine. Wallace admitted, at one point, taking drugs, but denied taking them since the birth of her daughter.

In January 2020, Wallace was suspended from &quot;EastEnders&quot; again by the BBC with a two-month suspension incurring due to an &quot;incident while filming&quot;.

In March 2022, Wallace became a grandmother for the first time, after her daughter gave birth to a son. 

In June 2022, Wallace was arrested after she assaulted a police officer outside a nightclub in Bury St Edmunds. She was released without charge but received a conditional caution. In response, Wallace was issued a warning for &quot;unacceptable behaviour&quot; by &quot;EastEnders&quot; bosses.

<text>Lashundra Trenyce Cobbins (; born March 31, 1980) is an American singer and actress best known as a finalist on the second season of &quot;American Idol&quot; and for her work in musical theatre. Raised in Memphis, Tennessee, Trenyce won one of the categories of the NAACP ACT-SO as a teenager, and attended the University of Memphis on a music scholarship.

In 2004, Trenyce began to focus on theatre, playing roles in the plays &quot;Not a Day Goes By&quot;, &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, &quot;Soul Kittens Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Sweet Potato Pie&quot;. In 2006, she played the lead role of Deena Jones in an Indianapolis production of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;. She made her film debut in 2008 and became the first &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant to headline a show in Las Vegas. She originated the role of Portia in David E. Talbert&#x27;s play &quot;Love in the Nick of Tyme&quot;. Trenyce performed in a 2009 North American tour of the musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot;.

From 2010 to 2013, she was the leading female vocalist in the revue &quot;Thriller – Live&quot; during a European tour and its West End run. She appeared in the 2013 comedy film &quot;Kick-Ass 2&quot;. In 2015, Trenyce hosted the Franco Dragone-produced cabaret show &quot;Taboo&quot; at the casino City of Dreams in Macau, China. She then returned to London for an extended reprise of her role in &quot;Thriller – Live&quot;. In 2017, she starred in the cabaret production &quot;Heart &amp; Soul: Music of Whitney Houston, Dionne Warwick &amp; Diana Ross&quot;, in California. In the same year, she played Diana Ross in a North American tour of &quot;&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Lashundra Trenyce Cobbins was born in Memphis, Tennessee on March 31, 1980. Her father, Jesse Cobbins, worked for St. Joe Company, and her mother, Linda Ruth Cobbins, worked at FedEx. She has an older and a younger sister. As a child, she decided to be known by her middle name, feeling that it better suited her ambitions as a performer. Trenyce has written that her interest in music started after performing a solo in a musical production celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. She grew up in North Memphis, where she attended Central High School and performed in various talent shows and pageants. In 1996, she won first place in a singing competition at the national NAACP Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics in Atlanta.

At the age of nineteen, Trenyce was arrested for theft at work. A Shelby County, Tennessee, court permitted her to participate in a pre-trial diversion program that expunged the felony charges from her record. She has denied the theft and claimed that it was a co-worker who stole the items from her workplace. Trenyce attended the University of Memphis on a full music scholarship. While in college, she joined the University Singers ensemble choir and its band Sound Fuzion, which toured throughout Tennessee. After completing three years of the school&#x27;s nursing program, Trenyce left the University of Memphis to pursue music full-time, performing in such venues as Rhythms Night Club, Precious Cargo and Isaac Hayes&#x27; Restaurant.

== Career ==

=== 2002–03: &quot;American Idol&quot;===
In October 2002, Trenyce auditioned for the second season of the reality television series &quot;American Idol.&quot; She became one of the 32 semi-finalists. She was eliminated in the top 30 round, but judge Paula Abdul chose her as a &quot;wildcard selection&quot; to become one of the twelve finalists. Trenyce&#x27;s arrest was disclosed to the public during an appearance on the show, but she was not removed from the series, as had happened with some former contestants. Producer Nigel Lythgoe clarified that Trenyce informed the producers of her criminal history from the outset. Trenyce placed fifth during the season finals. Jim Cantiello of MTV News connected the disclosure of Trenyce&#x27;s mug shot and felony theft charges to her elimination from the show by public voting. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also concluded that the news relating to her criminal record reduced her appeal with voters. Several media commentators suggested that racism may have played a role in Trenyce&#x27;s elimination, as she was one of only two dark-skinned finalists during the season (the other was winner Ruben Studdard).

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; found her to be one of the show&#x27;s most underrated contestants and called her a &quot;polished performer with enough sass to eschew her surname&quot;. Tim Cuprisin of &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; criticized Trenyce&#x27;s use of her mononymous stage name as &quot;a bit too slick even for a slick competition&quot;. Jan Jagodzinski argued in a 2005 book, however, that the name was an attempt to garner &quot;an American appeal&quot;, since her birth name Lashundra Cobbin is &quot;an impossible &#x27;pop&#x27; signifier&quot;. Judge Simon Cowell said that he &quot;never really warmed&quot; to Trenyce, as she &quot;worked very hard at her image – too hard&quot;.

In 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine included Trenyce&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; in its list of the 100 best &quot;American Idol&quot; live performances. Vulture.com&#x27;s Maura Johnston criticized Trenyce for being &quot;[a] little yell-y, a little pitch-y, a little guarded&quot;, but praised her voice and song choices and felt that she set &quot;a precedent for the divas who followed&quot; in later &quot;American Idol&quot; seasons. Trenyce&#x27;s performance of &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; was included on the compilation album &quot;American Idol Season 2: All-Time Classic American Love Songs&quot; (2003). AllMusic&#x27;s Heather Phares thought Trenyce was one of the strongest performers of the show, but criticized her cover version for having an &quot;indistinct quality&quot;. In an interview, Trenyce said that she was offered a record deal, following her appearance on &quot;American Idol&quot;, but she and her mother (who was her manager) rejected it because she found the terms unsatisfactory.

Following her elimination, Trenyce made appearances on television shows, including &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot;, &quot;ET&quot;, &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, &quot;The Early Show&quot;, &quot;The Wayne Brady Show&quot;, &quot;Inside Edition&quot;, &quot;Good Day Live&quot;, the &quot;Today Show&quot; and &quot;TRL&quot;. She also was featured in various Memphis periodicals, including as one of Memphis&#x27; 30 Most Beautiful People in &quot;Elite Magazine&#x27;s&quot; June 2003 issue, and appeared on a cover of &quot;God Bless the USA&quot; along with the other &quot;American Idol&quot; Season 2 finalists. Trenyce participated in a three-month concert tour with the other season 2 finalists, performing &quot;Proud Mary&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;. Robin Givhan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was critical of Trenyce&#x27;s performance on the tour, saying that she demonstrated the &quot;earsplitting finesse of a sledgehammer&quot;. Arion Berger of the same publication described her as &quot;a female drag queen with a diva&#x27;s intimidating presence&quot;.

=== 2004–09: Transition to musical theatre ===

Trenyce&#x27;s work in theatre has mostly focused on &quot;various entertainment aspects of African-American interest&quot;. In 2004, she made her theatre debut as Yancey in a North American tour of &quot;Not a Day Goes By&quot;, a play with songs adapted from the E. Lynn Harris&#x27; 2000 novel of the same name. The tour ran from January to May 2004. &quot;Jet&quot; magazine wrote that Trenyce &quot;breathes life and voice into Yancey&quot;, describing her as one of the show&#x27;s &quot;rich vocal talents&quot;. &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; felt that Trenyce displayed a &quot;theatrical perception as she interprets a character&quot;. She soon performed in the play &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;. In 2005, she played in two Nicci Gillbert stage productions: &quot;Soul Kittens Cabaret&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Sweet Potato Pie&quot;, participating in a North American tour of the latter. Trenyce&#x27;s performance as the wife in &quot;Mama&#x27;s Sweet Potato Pie&quot; was praised by &quot;Call and Post&quot; Chris Bournea. The same year, she made a cameo appearance in the comedy film &quot;Beauty Shop&quot;, and performed on the BET reality television series &quot;College Hill&quot;.

Trenyce played the leading role of Deena Jones in an Indianapolis production of the musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, which ran from June to July 2006. Her performance received positive reviews, including one from the newspaper &quot;NUVO&quot;, commenting that Trenyce&#x27;s &quot;smooth voice creat[ed] a sound for The Dreams that could easily have taken the group to the top of the charts&quot;. David Lindquist of &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; thought that Trenyce brought &quot;star power&quot; to the production. In the same year, she became the first &quot;American Idol&quot; contestant to headline a show in Las Vegas, Nevada, with &quot;V: The Ultimate Variety Show&quot; and &quot;Late Night Idol&quot; at the Sahara Hotel and Casino. She hosted it for nine months.

In 2007, Trenyce played Portia in David E. Talbert&#x27;s play &quot;Love in the Nick of Tyme&quot;. It toured in North America to seventeen cities, starting in the Beacon Theatre in New York in January. In 2010, a film of the play was released on DVD, and its soundtrack was released separately. The film was also broadcast on Black Entertainment Television (BET). Trenyce performed at the Razz Room in San Francisco from July 22 to August 2, 2008. The same year, she made her film debut as Unique in the LGBT independent romantic comedy movie &quot;Friends &amp; Lovers: The Ski Trip 2&quot;. A year later, she contributed the title track to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Truth Hall&quot;. Trenyce played a role in the 30th anniversary revival tour of the musical &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; after a recommendation from Ruben Studdard. As traditionally done with the show, the performers used their own names for their characters. The cast album received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards.

=== 2010–14: &quot;Thriller – Live&quot; and work in London ===

In 2010, Trenyce sang during the interludes and dance performances for Louis Van Amstel&quot;s &quot;Ballroom with a Twist&quot;. Karyn Saemann of Madison.com described Trenyce as &quot;a truly gifted singer who did more than justice to several tunes&quot;, especially in her performances of Whitney Houston songs.

Later in 2010, Trenyce joined the Michael Jackson tribute concert revue &quot;Thriller – Live&quot; as the leading female vocalist during a European tour. She reprised her role when the show played at the Lyric Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. She starred in the concert for three years, from 2010 until 2013, performing material from different periods in Jackson&#x27;s career. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Trenyce said that the audience was initially hesitant to hear a woman interpret Jackson&#x27;s music. &quot;Theatreworld&#x27;s&quot; Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce&#x27;s performance, writing that her voice sounded very similar to Jackson&#x27;s and describing her as an improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.

While in London, Trenyce also hosted the variety show &quot;The Box&quot;. In 2012, she provided the vocals for Baff Akoto&#x27;s short film &quot;Afterglow&quot; about a group of friends who navigate jazz culture in London. She had a minor role in the 2013 superhero, comedy film &quot;Kick-Ass 2&quot; as Hit-Girl&#x27;s cheerleading coach. In December 2013, she released three songs: &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;In the End (Alright)&quot; and &quot;Where Do They Go?&quot; on iTunes. The following year, she worked with producer DJ Guy Scheiman on his single &quot;Brazil You&#x27;re Ready (Synethetic)&quot;, with remixes released in 2015.

=== 2015–present: Macau and other work ===
In 2015, Trenyce hosted &quot;Taboo&quot;, a cabaret show designed by Franco Dragone, in Macau, China. The show was staged in the casino City of Dreams; Trenyce was given creative control over the selection of musical genres and songs as long as they fit the cabaret&#x27;s overall style. Macau.com praised Trenyce&#x27;s stage presence and &quot;the power of her voice and stature&quot;. In 2016, Trenyce collaborated with DJ Guy Scheiman on his single &quot;This Time&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, Trenyce reprised her role in the West End production of &quot;Thriller – Live&quot;. Reviewer Hannah Kerin praised Trenyce&#x27;s performance of Jackson&#x27;s 1987 single &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, calling it &quot;show-stopping&quot; and writing that it &quot;stood out amidst many fantastic renditions of the hits and less well known material&quot;.

In 2017, Trenyce starred in &quot;Heart &amp; Soul: Music of Whitney Houston, Dionne Warwick &amp; Diana Ross&quot;, promoted as part of &quot;the Chris Isaacson Presents lineup of spring cabaret fare&quot;. as one of &quot;three sultry starlets&quot;. She participated in the show during its stints at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood and Martinis Above Fourth in San Diego, California. The same year, she volunteered in Karamu House, speaking to young girls and participating in its &quot;Saving Our Daughters Cinderellas on Broadway&quot; program; she was named &quot;Celebrity Godparent&quot; for her work.

<text>Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology, branded as Seneca Polytechnic since 2023, is a multi-campus public college in the Greater Toronto Area and Peterborough, Ontario, Canada. It offers full-time and part-time programs at the baccalaureate, diploma, certificate, and graduate levels.

==History==

Seneca opened in 1966 as part of a provincial initiative to establish an Ontario-wide network of colleges of applied arts and technology providing career-oriented diploma and certificate courses as well as continuing education programs to Ontario communities. The province was responding to the increasing need for sophisticated applied learning as technology continued to change the nature of work and the provincial economy. General education was considered an important element in post secondary education, and breadth courses continue to be a part of every program. In 2001, the colleges were granted the ability to offer baccalaureate degrees. Seneca is one of five Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning that can offer up to 15 per cent of its program activity at the degree level.

==Campuses==
Seneca has campus locations throughout the Greater Toronto Area and in Peterborough.

===Newnham Campus===

The Newnham Campus is one of the largest college campuses in Canada. It has more than 15,000 full-time students in business, engineering, aviation, early childhood education, fashion, opticianry, information and communications technology, and liberal arts. The campus, initially known as Finch Campus, was renamed in 1984 after founding president William Thomson Newnham, and is also the site of continuing education activity during the evenings and weekends. The campus includes a 1,113-bed residence, sports centre, and daycare centre. It is located west of the intersection of Highway 404 and Finch Avenue East .

The campus&#x27;s first building was opened in 1969 and has involved various architects (William H.D. Hurst (Phase 1); John B. Parkin (Phase 2 with Searle, Wilbee and Rowland); Abram, Nowski, and McLaughlin (arena)). In 1973 a domed planetarium was added to the Phase 3 section of the campus, but it has since closed.

In fall 2011, a expansion, designed for energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, was officially opened at the campus. The new building, designed by Craig Applegath of Dialog, features three 80-seat classrooms; twenty-three 40-seat classrooms; fourteen 40-seat computer labs; a multi-purpose auditorium for 240 students that can be turned into a conference room or two 120-seat lecture halls; increased computing commons and library space; several new areas of collaborative student study and work space; a new &quot;front door&quot; for the campus; and improved campus access for people with disabilities. The atrium in the new space was named after Frederick Minkler, Seneca&#x27;s first chair of the board of governors.

In 2019, Seneca&#x27;s Centre for Innovation, Technology and Entrepreneurship (CITE) opened at Newnham Campus. CITE includes Seneca&#x27;s innovation centre known HELIX, technology labs for mechatronics and robotics courses, and computer labs and classrooms. CITE is infused with Indigenous design, the highlight of which is a diameter medallion in terrazzo rendered from an original work by Joseph Sagaj.

Quinlan Building, designed by architect Raymond Moriyama and named after Seneca&#x27;s third president Steve Quinlan.

There is a residence for Seneca students on campus. Seneca Residence is a suite-style building for about 230 students with a lounge, laundry room, and common kitchen.

Eaton Hall, the former summer home of the Eaton family, is on the shore of Lake Seneca. Eaton Hall is the former home of Seneca&#x27;s Management Development Centre, and has also been the setting of several films, including David Cronenberg&#x27;s &quot;A History of Violence&quot;, Richard Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot;, and William Fruet&#x27;s &quot;Death Weekend&quot; (&quot;The House by the Lake&quot;).

In June 2011, the Government of Ontario announced a $43 million project to expand services at the campus, including a new building with 25 classrooms, a library, computer services, and health care training laboratories. The project became Magna Hall, a facility that officially opened on 27 September 2018. Named in recognition of a significant gift from Magna International, it includes 25 classrooms, computer labs, specialty labs, a library, a student centre and a multi-purpose athletic and recreation space.

A part of the campus at the northwest corner of Dufferin Street and 15th Sideroad will house a community centre for King City. The township of King will lease the land for $1 per year for 99 years.

Seneca has been active in international education for decades and now attracts about 10,000 international students each year from about 130 countries. Seneca&#x27;s English Language Institute prepares international students for post-secondary study through intensive language training that can last anywhere from two months to more than a year. The college has several partnerships with overseas institutions and is expanding its activities in joint applied research and work / study abroad options.

Ethical problems with Canadian college&#x27;s international student enrolment has become an issue which has resulted in 23 of 24 Ontario colleges implementing standards of practice to protect international students because most of them had entered into partnerships with for-profit private colleges. Seneca did not. Seneca Polytechnic has not implemented these standards.

==Residence==

Seneca Polytechnic currently offers residence at both the Newnham Campus and the King Campus. Seneca residences are composed of suite-style units containing two bedrooms, a bathroom and kitchenette. Each bedroom contains a double bed, desk, chair, closet and dresser space, as well as cable TV, internet access and phone. Students also have access to a common kitchen, laundry rooms, lounge areas, a games room and a convenience store. Buildings have a front desk and 24-hour video monitoring, and are accessed by swipe card. The King Campus residence houses 233 students in a three-storey low-rise structure, while the Newnham Campus residence houses 1,113 students in a high-rise tower with a dining hall, convenience store, and restaurant all within the building. Seneca Polytechnic Residence have organized a free shuttle service from the Newnham Campus to the Markham, Seneca@York and King campuses.

==Athletics==

The school&#x27;s athletic teams are named &quot;The Sting&quot;. The Seneca Sting is one of the most-decorated athletic programs in the history of the Ontario Colleges Athletic Association (OCAA), having won more than 450 medals since 1967. Seneca has eighteen varsity sports teams for men and women, including badminton, baseball, basketball, cross country running, dance, rugby, soccer (indoor and outdoor), softball, and volleyball. The Seneca Sports Centre located at the Newnham Campus includes a full ice arena, a triple gymnasium, six tennis courts, a softball diamond, two beach volleyball courts, a soccer field, and a fitness centre with a dance studio. Seneca Polytechnic also offers various fields, gymnasiums and fitness equipment at other campuses.

==Concerts==
Seneca hosted a number of concerts in the 1970s and 1980s at the Minkler Auditorium and Seneca Field House (both at Newnham Campus). Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus performed at the Minkler Auditorium on their first Canadian tour in 1973. The Grateful Dead performed at Seneca Polytechnic&#x27;s Field House on 2 November 1977. Other famous artists who performed in the late seventies and eighties at Seneca include Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen (in one of his first Canadian appearances), David Bowie, Thin Lizzy (1977), Graham Parker, Sparks, Teenage Head, Max Webster (1977), Blondie, and Iggy Pop.

<text>Amihai &quot;Ami&quot; Mazar (; born November 19, 1942) is an Israeli archaeologist. Born in Haifa, Israel (then the British Mandate of Palestine), he has been since 1994 a professor at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, holding the Eleazer Sukenik Chair in the Archaeology of Israel.

His &quot;Archaeology of the Land of the Bible&quot; is a widely used textbook for Israelite archaeology in universities.

Mazar&#x27;s work has resulted in the Modified Conventional Chronology being the most widely accepted framework for the Israelite chronology during the Iron Age period.

Mazar is married with three children and resides in Jerusalem. He is the nephew of Benjamin Mazar, one of the first generation of pioneering Israeli archaeologists after Independence, and cousin to the late archaeologist Eilat Mazar.

==Archaeological excavations==

Amihai Mazar has directed archaeological excavations at a number of sites in Israel and the Palestinian territories that include:
* Tell Qasile
* Timnah (Tel Batash) – from 1977–1989
* Bull Site – from 1978-1981
* Bet She&#x27;an – from 1989–1996
* Rehov (Tel Rehov) – from 1997-2012

Amihai Mazar was one of the first archaeologists to normalize the use of radiocarbon dating in Levantine and Mediterranean sites more broadly, starting with his work at Tel Rehov.

===Ancient beehives===
While excavating the ancient city of Rehov Mazar discovered 30 intact hives, dating from c. 900 BCE, a time when the city had about 2,000 residents. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows and may be the oldest complete beehives ever discovered.

==Awards==
In 2009, Prof. Mazar was awarded the Israel Prize in archaeology.

<text>The NASA Pathfinder and NASA Pathfinder Plus were the first two aircraft developed as part of an evolutionary series of solar- and fuel-cell-system-powered unmanned aerial vehicles. AeroVironment, Inc. developed the vehicles under NASA&#x27;s Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) program. They were built to develop the technologies that would allow long-term, high-altitude aircraft to serve as atmospheric satellites, to perform atmospheric research tasks as well as serve as communications platforms. They were developed further into the NASA Centurion and NASA Helios aircraft.

==Pathfinder==
AeroVironment initiated its development of full-scale solar-powered aircraft with the Gossamer Penguin and Solar Challenger vehicles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, following the pioneering work of Robert Boucher, who built the first solar-powered flying models in 1974. As part of the ERAST program, AeroVironment built four generations of long endurance unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under the leadership of Ray Morgan, the first of which was the Pathfinder.

===Development===
In 1983, AeroVironment obtained funding from an unspecified US government agency to secretly investigate a UAV concept designated &quot;High Altitude Solar&quot; or HALSOL. The HALSOL prototype first flew in June 1983. Nine HALSOL flights took place at Groom Lake in Nevada. The flights were conducted using radio control and battery power, as the aircraft had not been fitted with solar cells. HALSOL&#x27;s aerodynamics were validated, but the investigation led to the conclusion that neither photovoltaic cell nor energy storage technology were mature enough to make the idea practical for the time being, and so HALSOL was put into storage.

In 1993, after ten years in storage, the aircraft was brought back to flight status for a brief mission by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). With the addition of small solar arrays, five low-altitude checkout flights were flown under the BMDO program at NASA Dryden in the fall of 1993 and early 1994 on a combination of solar and battery power.

In 1994 the aircraft transferred to the NASA ERAST Program to develop science platform aircraft technology. It was renamed &quot;Pathfinder&quot; because it was &quot;literally the pathfinder for a future fleet of solar-powered aircraft that could stay airborne for weeks or months on scientific sampling and imaging missions&quot;. A series of flights were planned to demonstrate that an extremely light and fragile aircraft structure with a very high aspect ratio (the ratio between the wingspan and the wing chord) can successfully take-off and land from an airport and can be flown to extremely high altitudes (between and ) propelled by the power of the sun. In addition, the ERAST Project also wanted to determine the feasibility of such a UAV for carrying instruments used in a variety of scientific studies.

On October 21, 1995, the aircraft&#x27;s fragility was aptly demonstrated when it was severely damaged in a hangar accident, but was subsequently rebuilt.

===Aircraft description===
Pathfinder was powered by eight electric motors — later reduced to six — which were first powered by batteries. It had a wing span of . Two underwing pods contain the landing gear, batteries, triple-redundant instrumentation system, and dual-redundant flight control computers. By the time the aircraft was adopted into the ERAST project in late 1993, solar cells were being added, eventually covering the entire upper surface of the wing. The solar arrays provide power for the aircraft&#x27;s electric motors, avionics, communications and other electronic systems. Pathfinder also had a backup battery system that can provide power for between two and five hours to allow limited-duration flight after dark.

Pathfinder flies at an airspeed of only to . Pitch control is maintained by the use of tiny elevators on the trailing edge of the wing Turn and yaw control is accomplished by slowing down or speeding up the motors on the outboard sections of the wing.

===Flight testing and records===
Major science activities of Pathfinder missions have included detection of forest nutrient status, forest regrowth after damage caused by Hurricane Iniki in 1992, sediment/algal concentrations in coastal waters and assessment of coral reef health. Science activities are coordinated by the NASA Ames Research Center and include researchers at the University of Hawaii and the University of California. Pathfinder flight tested two ERAST-developed scientific instruments, a high spectral resolution Digital Array Scanned Interferometer (DASI) and a high spatial resolution Airborne Real-Time Imaging System (ARTIS), both developed at Ames. These flights were conducted at altitudes between and in 1997.

On September 11, 1995, Pathfinder set an unofficial altitude record for solar powered aircraft of during a 12-hour flight from NASA Dryden. This and subsequent records claimed by NASA for Pathfinder remain unofficial, as they were not validated by the FAI, the internationally recognized aviation world record sanctioning body. The National Aeronautic Association presented the NASA-industry ERAST team with an award for one of the &quot;10 Most Memorable Record Flights&quot; of 1995.

After further modifications, the aircraft was moved to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. On one of seven flights there in the spring and summer of 1997, Pathfinder raised the altitude record for solar-powered aircraft — as well as propeller-driven aircraft — to on July 7, 1997. During those flights, Pathfinder carried two lightweight imaging instruments to learn more about the island&#x27;s terrestrial and coastal ecosystems, demonstrating the potential of such aircraft as platforms for scientific research.

==Pathfinder-Plus==
During 1998, the Pathfinder was modified into the longer-winged Pathfinder-Plus configuration. It used four of the five sections from the original Pathfinder wing, but substituted a new long center wing section that incorporated a high-altitude airfoil designed for the follow-on Centurion/Helios. The new section was twice as long as the original, and increased the overall wingspan of the craft from to . The new center section was topped by more-efficient silicon solar cells developed by SunPower Corporation of Sunnyvale, California, which could convert almost 19 percent of the solar energy they receive to useful electrical energy to power the craft&#x27;s motors, avionics and communication systems. That compared with about 14 percent efficiency for the older solar arrays that cover most of the surface of the mid- and outer wing panels from the original Pathfinder. Maximum potential power was boosted from about 7,500 watts on Pathfinder to about 12,500 watts on Pathfinder-Plus. The number of electric motors was increased to eight, and the motors used were more powerful units, designed for the follow-on aircraft.

The Pathfinder-Plus development flights flown at PMRF in the summer of 1998 validated power, aerodynamic, and systems technologies for its successor, the Centurion. On August 6, 1998, Pathfinder-Plus, piloted by Derek Lisoski, proved its design by raising the national altitude record to for solar-powered and propeller-driven aircraft.

===Atmospheric satellite tests===
In July 2002 Pathfinder-Plus carried commercial communications relay equipment developed by Skytower, Inc., a subsidiary of AeroVironment, in a test of using the aircraft as a broadcast platform. Skytower, in partnership with NASA and the Japan Ministry of Telecommunications, tested the concept of an &quot;atmospheric satellite&quot; by successfully using the aircraft to transmit both an HDTV signal as well as an IMT-2000 wireless communications signal from , giving the aircraft the equivalence of a tall transmitter tower. Because of the aircraft&#x27;s high lookdown angle, the transmission utilized only one watt of power, or 1/10,000 of the power required by a terrestrial tower to provide the same signal. According to Stuart Hindle, Vice President of Strategy &amp; Business Development for SkyTower, &quot;SkyTower platforms are basically geostationary satellites without the time delay.&quot; Further, Hindle said that such platforms flying in the stratosphere, as opposed to actual satellites, can achieve much higher levels of frequency use. &quot;A single SkyTower platform can provide over 1,000 times the fixed broadband local access capacity of a geostationary satellite using the same frequency band, on a bytes per second per square mile basis.&quot;

Ray Morgan, president of AeroVironment, has described the concept as, &quot;What we&#x27;re trying to do is create what we call an &#x27;atmospheric satellite,&#x27; which operates and performs many of the functions as a satellite would do in space, but does it very close in, in the atmosphere&quot;

Daniel Giroux is the current president of the college. Daniel Giroux was previously the vice president of workforce and business development at Collège Boréal and succeeded Pierre Riopel in 2016. Pierre Riopel succeeded Denis Hubert-Dutrisac, who retired in 2013. Hubert-Dutrisac succeeded Gisèle Chrétien in 2006, when she was appointed president of the French-language television channel TFO.

==Programs==
Collège Boréal offers 78 postsecondary and apprenticeship programs in its five schools; the School of Health Sciences, the School of Trades and Applied Technologies, the School of Arts, the School of Advancement, and the School of Business and Community Services.

In cooperation with Contact North, 112 online training centres and 31 videoconference rooms are also available throughout the Collège Boréal network.

==Residences==
The residences comprise 70 units, housing 138 students (most units house 2 students).

==Facilities==
Besides its campuses and access centres, Collège Boréal has facilities with varied educational objectives in a number of activity sectors. Health sciences, trades, culinary arts, community services and environmental technologies are among the main fields of expertise.

In 2007, the second floor of the main building of the college became the official home of the Minshall Museum. A gift from the family of the late Aubrey Minshall, this collection of naturalized animals is useful for students in the Natural Resources programs.

In 2009, the Xstrata Nickel Biodiversity Applied Research Centre was opened at the main campus in Sudbury. With a production capacity of 500,000 trees per year, the centre contributes to the effort of regreening Greater Sudbury as well as the mining businesses in the northern part of the province. Since 2011, a 2,100-acre experimental forest was added, providing more field experience to students in the forestry programs.

In 2010, the Louis-Riel Centre was opened; its mission is to offer a broad range of services to aboriginal students. Various workshops and shows are presented every year, such as the Aboriginal Pride Nights that hosted artists Florent Vollant and Elisapie Isaac in 2013.

In 2011, the college opened a new restaurant, Au pied du rocher, allowing the students of the culinary arts to serve to the public. The program is run in partnership with Niagara College&#x27;s Canadian Food and Wine Institute.

In 2012, Collège Boréal opened a new campus in the heart of Toronto at One Yonge Street. The same year a new 358-seat concert hall also opened its doors to the great delight of art and culture lovers in Greater Sudbury. Furthermore, since 1997, the Sudbury theatre production centre, the Théâtre du Nouvel-Ontario (TNO), has been housed on the main campus in Sudbury.

<doc id="673147" wikidata="Q1778600" url="?curid=673147" title="Maldivian Democratic Party">
<text>The Maldivian Democratic Party (, &quot;Dhivehi Rayyithunge Demokretik Paati&quot;; MDP) is the first political party formed in the Republic of Maldives. 

The party is supportive of the promotion of human rights and democracy in the Maldives. It won the first ever multi-party elections in the Maldives with the support from all the other political parties in the 2008 elections against then president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.

==History==
There had not been political parties in the Maldives since 1952. The MDP initially submitted its registration on 24 February 2001. In 2001, the party&#x27;s first president was Qasim Ibrahim. Although the Maldivian Constitution allows political parties to operate, the MDP&#x27;s application was rebuffed. After the people fighting for their rights on the street and the death of Evan Naseem, MDP declared its existence in exile from Sri Lanka on 10 November 2003. Initially, it was formed by a group of 42 people, which included members of parliament, a former cabinet minister and leading businessmen. Members on its first general council were elected on 13 February 2004. Although the MDP was not recognized by the Maldivian government, it began operating in Maldives on 30 April 2005.

On 2 June 2005, the members of the People&#x27;s Majlis unanimously voted to legally recognize political parties. The MDP subsequently submitted its registration on 26 June 2005, becoming the first political party to be registered in the Second Republic of Maldives.

Throughout 2006, the opposition faced restrictions on freedom of assembly, and the government continued to arrest opposition activists. In March 2006, the government introduced a &quot;Roadmap for Reform&quot; and subsequently introduced several bills in parliament. In August 2007, voters decided via referendum that the Maldives&#x27; new constitution should provide for a presidential system of government (vice parliamentary). The special Majlis completed its work and the new constitution took effect in August 2008.

In accordance with the new constitution ratified by then-President Gayoom on 7 August 2008, the first round of presidential elections was held on 10 October 2008. Due to no single candidate receiving 50% of the vote, a second round was held on 29 October between President Gayoom and Mohamed Nasheed. Nasheed won with 54% of the vote.

At the first multi-party parliamentary elections in Maldives, on 9 May 2009, the MDP won 26 out of the 77 seats in the parliament, netting the second-most seats. However, the MDP gained the most votes, with a total of 35.3% (50,562 votes) which is a 10.39% increase from the first round of 2008 presidential elections when the MDP was allied with other parties. From the elections, Gayoom&#x27;s DRP gained 27.5% of the votes (39,399 votes) which is a 12.5% decrease from the first round of the 2008 presidential elections. In November 2013 elections ex-President Mohamed of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) narrowly lost and Abdulla Yameen of PPM was elected as new president of Maldives.

In the 2018 presidential elections, the MDP candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih defeated incumbent President Abdulla Yameen, and was sworn in as president on November 17, 2018. He promised to fight against widespread corruption and investigate the human rights abuses of the previous regime. In the April 2019 parliamentary election, the party won a landslide victory, and won 65 of 87 seats of the parliament. This was the first time a single party was able to get such a high number of seats in the parliament in Maldivian history.

=== Post-2018 election ===
In June 2022, former President and Speaker of Parliament Mohamed Nasheed announced that he would be contesting against the incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in the Maldivian Democratic Party&#x27;s primary election amid a growing political rift between the two. The rift originally started with a disagreement between the two on changing the Maldives&#x27; presidential system of governance to a parliamentary system, with Nasheed preferring the latter. Nasheed also accused the President of enacting policies contrary to the founding principles and ideology of the party, occasionally voting against bills sent by the MDP government in parliament. He also alleged that the President had removed more than 39,000 of the original party members from the membership register, stating that they were less likely to vote for him and potentially twist the primary election in the President&#x27;s favor. The results revealed that President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won the primary election with 61.10% of the vote.

On 17 May 2023, 12 members of Maldivian Democratic Party left the and formed a new party called The Democrats. The twelve members defected from the MDP after the warnings of expulsions of four MDP MPs in their faction from the party as well as the expulsion of Central Henveiru MP Ali Azim (who was also a Nasheed loyalist). The faction on several occasions violated the party&#x27;s whip line and launched a no-confidence motion against multiple government ministers in Ibrahim Mohamed Solih&#x27;s cabinet. 

On 21 June 2023, the party&#x27;s leader and the faction&#x27;s leader Mohamed Nasheed quit after 18 years of being a member of the party and joined the newly created Democrats. 

The Democrats had announced that they would contest in the 2023 Presidential election in September. But the party came third place with 7% of the vote, making them ineligible to run in the second round. 

In the first round of the 2023 elections, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih received 39% of the votes to the PNC/PPM candidate Mohamed Muizzu&#x27;s 46%. In the second round, held on 30 September 2023, Mohamed Muizzu won the second-round runoff of the Maldives presidential election, beating incumbent president, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, with 54% of the vote to his 45%. Some attribute this loss to The Democrats and others to dissatisfaction with Ibrahim Mohamed Solih&#x27;s presidency.

On 29 December 2023, several members of the MDP defected to PNC.

In the 2024 Maldivian parliamentary election, the party was wiped out in an landslide defeat, losing 56 seats and winning just 9.

<text>Fine Line Features was the specialty films division of New Line Cinema. From 1991 to 2005, under founder and president Ira Deutchman, Fine Line acquired, distributed and marketed independent films. In 2005, New Line teamed up with fellow Time Warner subsidiary HBO to form Picturehouse, a new specialty film label into which Fine Line was folded.

Fine Line Features DVD releases were split between HBO Video and New Line Home Entertainment. When New Line Home Entertainment ceased to exist in 2010, it was folded into Warner Home Video.

<doc id="673153" wikidata="Q2880966" url="?curid=673153" title="Dopaminergic pathways">
<text>Dopaminergic pathways (dopamine pathways, dopaminergic projections) in the human brain are involved in both physiological and behavioral processes including movement, cognition, executive functions, reward, motivation, and neuroendocrine control. Each pathway is a set of projection neurons, consisting of individual dopaminergic neurons. 

The four major dopaminergic pathways are the mesolimbic pathway, the mesocortical pathway, the nigrostriatal pathway, and the tuberoinfundibular pathway. The mesolimbic pathway and the mesocortical pathway form the mesocorticolimbic system. Two other dopaminergic pathways to be considered are the hypothalamospinal tract and the incertohypothalamic pathway.

Parkinson&#x27;s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance use disorders (addiction), and restless legs syndrome (RLS) can be attributed to dysfunction in specific dopaminergic pathways. 

The dopamine neurons of the dopaminergic pathways synthesize and release the neurotransmitter dopamine. Enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and dopa decarboxylase are required for dopamine synthesis. These enzymes are both produced in the cell bodies of dopamine neurons. Dopamine is stored in the cytoplasm and vesicles in axon terminals. Dopamine release from vesicles is triggered by action potential propagation-induced membrane depolarization. The axons of dopamine neurons extend the entire length of their designated pathway.

== Pathways ==

=== Major ===

Six of the dopaminergic pathways are listed below.

=== Minor ===
:Hypothalamospinal
:* Hypothalamus → Spinal cord
:Incertohypothalamic
:* Zona incerta → Hypothalamus
:* Zona incerta → Brainstem VTA → Amygdala (mesoamygdaloid pathway)
:VTA → Hippocampus
:VTA → Cingulate cortex
:VTA → Olfactory bulb
:SNc → Subthalamic nucleus
== Function ==

=== Mesocorticolimbic system ===

The mesocorticolimbic system (mesocorticolimbic circuit) refers to both the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways. Both pathways originate at the ventral tegmental area (VTA) which is located in the midbrain. Through separate connections to the prefrontal cortex (mesocortical) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic), the mesocorticolimbic projection has a significant role in learning, motivation, reward, memory and movement. Dopamine receptor subtypes, D1 and D2 have been shown to have complementary functions in the mesocorticolimbic projection, facilitating learning in response to both positive and negative feedback. Both pathways of the mesocorticolimbic system are associated with ADHD, schizophrenia and addiction. 

==== Mesocortical pathway ====

The mesocortical pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to the prefrontal cortex (VTA → Prefrontal cortex). This pathway is involved in cognition and the regulation of executive functions (e.g., attention, working memory, inhibitory control, planning, etc.) This intricate neural circuit serves as a crucial communication route within the brain, facilitating the transmission of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with reward, motivation, and cognitive control. The prefrontal cortex, being a central hub for executive functions, relies on the input from the mesocortical pathway to modulate and fine-tune cognitive processes essential for goal-directed behavior and decision-making. Dysregulation of the neurons in this pathway has been connected to ADHD. 

==== Mesolimbic pathway ====

Referred to as the reward pathway, mesolimbic pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to the ventral striatum (VTA → Ventral striatum [nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle]). When a reward is anticipated, the firing rate of dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic pathway increases. The mesolimbic pathway is involved with incentive salience, motivation, reinforcement learning, fear and other cognitive processes. In animal studies, depletion of dopamine in this pathway, or lesions at its site of origin, decrease the extent to which an animal is willing to go to obtain a reward (e.g., the number of lever presses for nicotine or time searching for food). Research is ongoing to determine the role of the mesolimbic pathway in the perception of pleasure.

=== Nigrostriatal pathway ===
The nigrostriatal pathway is involved in behaviors relating to movement and motivation. The transmission of dopaminergic neurons to the dorsal striatum particularly plays a role in reward and motivation while movement is influenced by the transmission of dopaminergic neurons to the substantia nigra. The nigrostriatal pathway is associated with conditions such as Huntington&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, ADHD, Schizophrenia, and Tourette&#x27;s Syndrome. Huntington&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Tourette&#x27;s Syndrome are conditions affected by motor functioning while schizophrenia and ADHD are affected by reward and motivation functioning. This pathway also regulates associated learning such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning. 

=== Tuberoinfundibular pathway ===
The tuberoinfundibular pathway transmits dopamine from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. This neural circuit plays a pivotal role in the regulation of hormonal balance and, specifically, in modulating the secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland, which is responsible for breast milk production in females. Hyperprolactinemia is an associated condition caused by an excessive amount of prolactin production that is common in pregnant women. After childbirth, the tuberoinfundibular pathway resumes its role in regulating prolactin levels. The decline in estrogen levels postpartum contributes to the restoration of dopaminergic inhibition, preventing sustained hyperprolactinemia in non-pregnant and non-nursing individuals.

=== Cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop ===

The dopaminergic pathways that project from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) into the striatum (i.e., the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, respectively) form one component of a sequence of pathways known as the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. The nigrostriatal component of the loop consists of the SNc, giving rise to both inhibitory and excitatory pathways that run from the striatum into the globus pallidus, before carrying on to the thalamus, or into the subthalamic nucleus before heading into the thalamus. The dopaminergic neurons in this circuit increase the magnitude of phasic firing in response to positive reward error, that is when the reward exceeds the expected reward. These neurons do not decrease phasic firing during a negative reward prediction (less reward than expected), leading to hypothesis that serotonergic, rather than dopaminergic neurons encode reward loss. Dopamine phasic activity also increases during cues that signal negative events, however dopaminergic neuron stimulation still induces place preference, indicating its main role in evaluating a positive stimulus. From these findings, two hypotheses have developed, as to the role of the basal ganglia and nigrostriatal dopamine circuits in action selection. The first model suggests a &quot;critic&quot; which encodes value, and an actor which encodes responses to stimuli based on perceived value. However, the second model proposes that the actions do not originate in the basal ganglia, and instead originate in the cortex and are selected by the basal ganglia. This model proposes that the direct pathway controls appropriate behavior and the indirect suppresses actions not suitable for the situation. This model proposes that tonic dopaminergic firing increases the activity of the direct pathway, causing a bias towards executing actions faster.

These models of the basal ganglia are thought to be relevant to the study of OCD, ADHD, Tourette syndrome, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, schizophrenia, and addiction. For example, Parkinson&#x27;s disease is hypothesized to be a result of excessive inhibitory pathway activity, which explains the slow movement and cognitive deficits, while Tourettes is proposed to be a result of excessive excitatory activity resulting in the tics characteristic of Tourettes.
==Regulation==

The ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta receive inputs from other neurotransmitters systems, including glutaminergic inputs, GABAergic inputs, cholinergic inputs, and inputs from other monoaminergic nuclei. The VTA contains 5-HT1A receptors that exert a biphasic effects on firing, with low doses of 5-HT1A receptor agonists eliciting an increase in firing rate, and higher doses suppressing activity. The 5-HT2A receptors expressed on dopaminergic neurons increase activity, while 5-HT2C receptors elicit a decrease in activity. The mesolimbic pathway, which projects from the VTA to the nucleus accumbens, is also regulated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In particular, the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4 inhibits dopamine release, while muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 activation increases dopamine release. GABAergic inputs from the striatum decrease dopaminergic neuronal activity, and glutaminergic inputs from many cortical and subcortical areas increase the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons. Endocannabinoids also appear to have a modulatory effect on dopamine release from neurons that project out of the VTA and SNc. Noradrenergic inputs deriving from the locus coeruleus have excitatory and inhibitory effects on the dopaminergic neurons that project out of the VTA and SNc. The excitatory orexinergic inputs to the VTA originate in the lateral hypothalamus and may regulate the baseline firing of VTA dopaminergic neurons.

<text>In cardiology, hibernating myocardium is a state when some segments
of the myocardium exhibit abnormalities of contractile function. These
abnormalities can be visualised with echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), nuclear medicine (PET) or ventriculography.
Echocardiography: A wall motion abnormality at rest which improves during a low-dose dobutamine stress test is classified as &quot;hibernating myocardium.&quot; Low dose dobutamine stimulates contractile function and thus helps to predict functional recovery after revascularization.
Cardiac magnetic resonance: The most frequently used MR contrast agents based on Gd-chelates accumulate in the extracellular space which is increased in scarred myocardium. This leads to a signal increase which can be visualised with the &quot;late gadolinium enhancement technique.&quot; This is probably the most accurate way to visualise scarred myocardium. An alternative (or additional) technique with CMR is the use of low dose dobutamine similar to echocardiography.
PET: The finding of a perfusion or metabolic mismatch between PET-FDG and PET-NH3 is indicative of decreased metabolism. The wall of the affected segments is hypo-, a-, or dyskinetic.

The phenomenon is highly significant clinically because it usually manifests itself in the setting of chronic ischemia, that is potentially reversible by revascularisation via cardiac catheterization. The regions of myocardium are still viable and can return to normal function. There develops a new steady state between myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial function, MBF reduced and in consequence function is reduced too. The clinical situations where one can expect hibernating myocardium are:
* chronic stable angina
* unstable angina
* silent ischemia
* after AMI

<doc id="673158" wikidata="Q1608728" url="?curid=673158" title="The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)">
<text>The Shaggy Dog is a 1959 American fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and loosely based on the 1923 novel &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot; by Felix Salten. Directed by Charles Barton from a screenplay by Lillie Hayward and Bill Walsh, the film stars Fred MacMurray, Tommy Kirk, Jean Hagen, Kevin Corcoran, Tim Considine, Roberta Shore, and Annette Funicello. The film follows a teenage boy named Wilby Daniels who, by the power of an enchanted ring of the Borgias, is transformed into a shaggy Old English Sheepdog.

The film was released on March 19, 1959, and grossed over $9 million during its initial release, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1959. Its successes spawned a franchise thereafter including: a sequel &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; (1976), starring Dean Jones, Tim Conway, and Suzanne Pleshette. It was followed by a 1987 television sequel, a 1994 television remake and a 2006 theatrical live-action remake.

== Plot ==
Wilbur &quot;Wilby&quot; Daniels is a boy who creates often dangerous inventions. As a retired mailman who often ran afoul of canines, Wilby&#x27;s father Wilson hates dogs, and cannot understand why his younger son, Montgomery &quot;Moochie&quot; Daniels, wants one.

Wilby and his rival Buzz Miller go with French girl Francesca Andrassy to a museum. Buzz and Francesca eventually leave without Wilby. He later encounters Professor Plumcutt, whose newspaper Wilby used to deliver. Plumcutt mentions mystical ancient beliefs, including the legend of the Borgia family, who used shape-shifting as a weapon against their enemies.

Wilby later collides with a table that holds a display case of jewelry. He accidentally ends up with one of the rings in the cuff of his pants. It is the cursed Borgia ring, and after reading the inscription on it (&quot;&quot;In canis corpore transmuto&quot;, which, unknown to Wilby, means, &quot;Into a dog&#x27;s body I change&quot;), he transforms into Chiffon, Francesca&#x27;s Old English Sheepdog. Confused, Wilby, as a dog, goes to Plumcutt, who says that the Borgia curse can only be broken through a heroic act of selflessness. After getting chased out of his own house by an enraged Wilson, who fails to recognize him as a dog, Wilby continues to switch back and forth between human form and dog form. Only Moochie and Plumcutt know his true identity, as Wilby has spoken to them both in dog form.

Francesca sees that Chiffon has been acting strangely. She asks her adoptive father, Dr. Andrassy, to watch over Chiffon for the night. Wilby, as a dog, eventually overhears Dr. Valasky and his associate Thurm discuss plans to steal a government secret.

The next day, Wilby, as a dog, tells Moochie about the spies. Wilby reveals the secret to his dumbfounded father. As Wilby and Moochie discuss what to do next, Francesca&#x27;s butler Stefano drags Wilby into the house. Moochie runs to his father to get help, who goes to the authorities, until Wilson finds himself accused of being either crazy or a spy.

Stefano and Andrassy later discuss plans to steal a government secret, and Wilby, as a dog, overhears. He however transforms into human Wilby in front of the spies and is discovered, but not before he hears Andrassy expressing his wish to get rid of Francesca.

The spies force Francesca to leave with them, leaving the human Wilby bound and gagged in the closet. Moochie sneaks into the house and discovers Wilby, who has once again transformed into a dog.

When Buzz appears at the residence to take Francesca on a date, Wilby, still in his dog form, steals Buzz&#x27;s hot rod automobile. Buzz reports this to officers Hansen and Kelly, who report the suspect as a &quot;large shaggy dog&quot; This is sighted by two policemen who decide to aid Kelly and Hansen. Wilson and Moochie follow Buzz and the police, who end up chasing everyone. The spies attempt to leave aboard a boat, but the police call in the water police to apprehend Andrassy and stop his boat. Wilby, in his dog form, swims up and wrestles with the men, as Francesca gets knocked out of the boat. Wilby drags her to shore, where Buzz tries to take credit for her rescue. This angers Wilby, who still a dog, attacks Buzz. Wilby&#x27;s snarling turns into a tirade as Wilby finds himself wrestling with Buzz. Francesca awakens to see a wet Chiffon and hugs it, thinking that he was her rescuer. Noticing that he and Chiffon are seen together, Wilby realizes that he has broken the curse.

Now that Wilson and Chiffon are declared heroes, Francesca can leave for Paris without Andrassy and Stefano, both of whom are arrested for espionage, and she gives Chiffon to the Daniels family as her way of thanking them. Since Wilson has gotten such commendation for foiling a spy ring because of &quot;his love of dogs&quot;, he stops hating dogs and allows Moochie to care for Chiffon. Wilby and Buzz decide to forget their rivalry over Francesca and resume their friendship.

===Development===
Walt Disney had previously bought the rights to Felix Salten&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot; and produced an adaptation of it in 1942 under his animation department. Prior to that film&#x27;s release, Walt Disney bought the rights to five more Salten novels in May 1941, as well as options to have him adapt them. The novels were &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;Perri&quot;, &quot;Renni&quot;, &quot;City Jungle&quot;, and &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot;. He did not want to make &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Children&quot; but did not want anyone else to make it, but he intended to make the other films as cartoons. Salten was then living in Switzerland and was paid out of funds owing to Disney&#x27;s then-distributor RKO Radio Pictures which had been &quot;frozen&quot; in that country; this would be credited against money RKO owed Disney for distributing his films. Salten died in Zurich in 1945.

In June 1955, when Disney was making &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, he said he still had no plans to film &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot;. However, ABC wanted Disney to make another TV series, and he pitched them &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, &quot;a story that treated the younger generation and its problems in a light manner. They turned me down flat. I was hopping mad when I went back to the studio, so I called in Bill Walsh and said &#x27;Let&#x27;s make a feature of it.&#x27;&quot; Star Tommy Kirk later claimed the film was meant to be a two-part television show and &quot;only at the very last minute did they decide to splice them together and release them as a film.&quot;

In the late 1950s, the idea of an adult human turning into a beast was nothing new, but the idea of a teenager doing just that in a film was considered avant-garde and even shocking in 1957 when American International Pictures released their horror film, &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;, one of the studio&#x27;s biggest hits. &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; betrays its successful forebear with Fred MacMurray&#x27;s classic bit of dialogue: &quot;That&#x27;s ridiculous—my son is not a werewolf! He&#x27;s nothing more than just a big, baggy, stupid-looking shaggy dog!&quot;

The director was Charles Barton, who also directed &quot;Spin and Marty&quot; for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. Veteran screenwriter Lillie Hayward also worked on the &quot;Spin and Marty&quot; serials, which featured several of the same young actors as &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;. Disney producer Bill Walsh mused that &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; was the direct inspiration for the TV show &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, and Walsh said &quot;Same kids, same dog and Fred MacMurray!&quot;

===Casting===
The lead role went to Tommy Kirk, who had started with Disney in a Hardy Boys serial for &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; alongside Tim Considine. Considine also played a role, as did Annette Funicello who had been the most popular member of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. It was Funicello&#x27;s first film.

It took several months for Disney to find the right dog.

Kirk later said: &quot;At the time, I viewed it as a fairy tale, but in later years, I&#x27;ve come to think that the film has one of the screwiest combinations of plot elements in any movie ever made. It has all the realistic elements of the Cold War -- Russian spies plotting against the government -- mixed in with a rivalry over Annette between two teenage boys, mixed in with a fantasy about a boy who turns into a dog because he encounters a ring from the Borgias!&quot;

===Filming===
Filming started on August 4, 1958.
 Disney later recalled that &quot;nobody — not even on the lot — paid any attention to us. We made the picture for one and a quarter million dollars while the rest of the town was turning out super dupers.&quot;

Tim Considine was clawed in the eye by the sheepdog during filming.

Dialogue would be written to match the mouth movements of the dog. If the dog did not move its mouth, beef jerky was used.

Kirk said he had &quot;beautiful memories of&quot; Barton, &quot;as he was a very gentle, nice person with a good sense of humor&quot;. He also enjoyed working with MacMurray:
I thought he was a great actor. I liked him enormously. I tried to get to know him, and got to know him a little bit, but he did have a kind of wall that I never got around. He was distant, he was conservative, and kind of remote. He didn&#x27;t go out and have lunch. Instead, he had a tiny can of Metrecal — a horrible diet drink. There were stories about him being cheap, and I heard that he was worth $500 million at the time of his death. But I just loved him. They say he was Walt Disney&#x27;s favorite actor, and I can understand that. He ranks up there with Cary Grant as one of the great light comics.
Veteran Disney voice actor Paul Frees had a rare on-screen appearance in the film — for which he received no on-screen credit — as Dr. J.W. Galvin, a psychiatrist who examines Wilby&#x27;s father (MacMurray), Wilson Daniels. Frees also did his usual voice acting by also playing the part of the narrator who informs the audience that Wilson Daniels is a &quot;man noted for the fact that he is allergic to dogs&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; was the second-highest-grossing film of 1959 and was Disney&#x27;s most financially successful film of the 1950s. During its initial release, the film grossed $9.6 million in domestic theatrical rentals on a budget of less than $1 million, making it more profitable than the year&#x27;s highest-grossing film, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; also performed very strongly on a 1967 re-release. The film was the most profitable film made by Disney at that time.

According to &quot;Diabolique&quot;, &quot;the movie kicked off a whole bunch of comedies with a slight fantastical element that powered Disney film division for the next two decades. Much of the credit went to MacMurray; a lot of the credit should have gone to Kirk, whose easy-going boy next door charm made him the ideal American teen&quot;.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 70% approval rating with an average rating of 5.8/10, based on 20 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Novelization==
While the film is based on Salten&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of Florence&quot;, a novelization of the film published by Scholastic eight years later in 1967 made some changes to the plot. First, Funicello&#x27;s character Allison was removed entirely, and her name is not listed among the movie&#x27;s principal performers. As a result, the rivalry between Wilby and Buzz is greatly reduced. Also, Dr. Valasky is changed into Francesca&#x27;s uncle, not her adoptive father.

A comic book adaptation also appeared from Western Publishing, which followed the film&#x27;s storyline more closely. This was reprinted in 1978 as a companion story to an adaptation of &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; was at that time the most profitable film produced by Walt Disney Productions, which influenced the studio&#x27;s follow-up live-action film production. Using a formula of placing supernatural and/or fantastical forces within everyday mid-twentieth century American life, the studio created a series of &quot;gimmick comedies&quot; (a term used by Disney historian and film critic Leonard Maltin) with action to keep children entertained and some light satire to amuse the adult audience. Using television actors on their summer hiatus who were familiar to audiences but did not necessarily have enough clout to receive over-the-title billing (or a large fee) from another major studio was one way these comedies were produced inexpensively, they also tended to use the same sets from the Disney backlot repeatedly. This allowed Walt Disney Productions a low-risk scenario for production, any of these films could easily make back their investment just from moderate matinee attendance in neighborhood theatres, and they could also be packaged on the successful Disney anthology television series &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

The popular television series &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (1960–1972) reunited MacMurray and Considine, and also features a pet shaggy sheepdog named &quot;Tramp&quot;.

===Sequels===
* The film was followed in 1976 with a theatrical sequel, &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot;, starring Dean Jones as a 45-year-old Wilby Daniels. 
* In 1987, a two-part television movie set somewhere in the 17 years between the events portrayed in &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; and &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot;, entitled &quot;The Return of the Shaggy Dog&quot;, presented a post–&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; Gary Kroeger as a 30-something Wilby Daniels.

===Remakes===
* In 1994, the first remake of the film was a television movie, with Disney regular Scott Weinger as a teenaged Wilbert &quot;Wilby&quot; Joseph Daniels, and Ed Begley Jr. playing a part similar to the one originated by Fred MacMurray in 1959.
* In 2006, Disney released a live-action remake of the film with Tim Allen as a 50-something Dave Douglas. This film has an entirely different story, characters, and transformation plot device unrelated to the original trilogy. To tie-in with the theatrical release of the 2006 remake, the original 1959 film was re-issued in the United States as a special DVD labeled &quot;The Wild &amp; Woolly Edition&quot;, which featured the film in two forms: one in the original black and white, the other a colorized version. The colorized version however is not restored and suffers from age. In the UK, the 1959 film has only ever been made available on DVD in black and white. The 2006 remake and Tim Allen&#x27;s performance was poorly received by critics and fans of the 1959 original and 1994 remake, with a moderately successful box office return.

<text>The Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp is an American twin-row, 18-cylinder, air-cooled radial aircraft engine with a displacement of , and is part of the long-lived Wasp family of engines. 
The R-2800 saw widespread use in many important American aircraft during and after World War II. During the war years, Pratt &amp; Whitney continued to develop new ideas to upgrade the engine, including water injection for takeoff in cargo and passenger planes and to give emergency power in combat.

==Design and development==

First run in 1937, near the time that the larger competing 18-cylinder Wright Duplex-Cyclone&#x27;s development had been started in May of that year, the displacement R-2800 was first-flown by 1940, one year before the Duplex-Cyclone. The Double Wasp was more powerful than the world&#x27;s only other modern 18-cylinder engine, the Gnome-Rhône 18L of . 

The Double Wasp was much smaller in displacement than either of the other 18-cylinder designs, and heat dissipation was a greater problem. To enable more efficient cooling, the usual practice of casting or forging the cylinder head cooling fins that had been effective enough for other engine designs was discarded, and instead, much thinner and closer-pitched cooling fins were machined from the solid metal of the cylinder-head forging. The fins were all cut at the same time by a gang of milling saws, automatically guided as it fed across the head in such a way that the bottom of the grooves rose and fell to make the roots of the fins follow the contour of the head, with the elaborate process substantially increasing the surface area of the fins. 

The twin distributors on the Double Wasp were prominently mounted on the upper surface of the forward gear reduction housing - with one of the pair of magnetos mounted between them on most models - and almost always prominently visible within a cowling, with the conduits for the spark plug wires emerging from the distributors&#x27; cases either directly forward or directly behind them, or on the later C-series R-2800s with the two-piece gear reduction housings, on the &quot;outboard&quot; sides of the distributor casings.
When the R-2800 was introduced in 1939, it was capable of producing , for a specific power value of . The design of conventional air-cooled radial engines had become so scientific and systematic by then that the Double Wasp was introduced with a smaller incremental power increase than was typical of earlier engines. Nevertheless, in 1941 the power output of production models increased to , and to late in the war. Even more was coaxed from experimental models, with fan-cooled subtypes like the R-2800-57 producing , but in general the R-2800 was a rather highly developed powerplant right from the beginning.

===WWII===

The R-2800 powered several types of fighters and medium bombers during the war, including the US Navy&#x27;s Vought F4U Corsair, with the XF4U-1 first prototype Corsair becoming the first airframe to fly (as originally designed) with the Double Wasp in its XR-2800-4 prototype version on May 29, 1940, and the first single-engine American fighter plane to exceed in level flight during October 1940. The R-2800 also powered the Corsair&#x27;s naval rival, the Grumman F6F Hellcat, the US Army Air Forces&#x27; Republic P-47 Thunderbolt (which unusually, for single-engined aircraft, used a General Electric turbocharger), the twin-engine Martin B-26 Marauder and Douglas A-26 Invader, as well as the first purpose-built twin-engine radar-equipped night fighter, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow. 

When the US entered the war in December 1941, designs advanced rapidly, and long-established engines such as the Wright Cyclone and Double Wasp were re-rated on fuel of much higher octane rating (anti-knock value) to give considerably more power. By 1944, versions of the R-2800 powering late-model P-47s (and other aircraft) had a rating (experimental) of on 115-grade fuel with water injection.

After World War II, the engine was used in the Korean War, and surplus World War II aircraft powered by the Double Wasp served with other countries well past the Korean War, some being retired as late as the latter part of the 1960s when the aircraft were replaced.

===Peacetime===
Engines grow in power with development, but a major war demands the utmost performance from engines fitted to aircraft whose life in front-line service was unlikely to exceed 50 hours flying, over a period of only a month or two. In peacetime however, the call was for reliability over a period of perhaps a dozen years, and the R-2800&#x27;s reliability commended its use for long-range patrol aircraft and for the Douglas DC-6, Martin 4-0-4, and Convair 240 transports. The last two were twin-engine aircraft of size, passenger capacity, and high wing loading comparable to the DC-4 - itself usually powered by the R-2000 bored-out version of the Twin Wasp - and the first Constellations, which mostly used Wright Aeronautical&#x27;s large Duplex-Cyclones.

The Double Wasp still flies in restored vintage warbird aircraft displayed at air shows, and sees service worldwide on aircraft such as the Canadair CL-215 water-bomber. In addition, R-2800s continue to power Douglas DC-6 cargo and fuel-carrying aircraft in locations such as Alaska. A total of 125,334 R-2800 engines were produced between 1939 and 1960.

==Variants==
This is a list of representative R-2800 variants, describing some of the mechanical changes made during development of the Double Wasp. Power ratings quoted are usually maximum &quot;military&quot; power that the engine could generate on takeoff and at altitude; 100 Octane fuel was used, unless otherwise noted.

The R-2800 was developed and modified into a basic sequence of subtypes, &quot;A&quot; through &quot;E&quot; series, each of which indicated major internal and external modifications and improvements, such that the &quot;E&quot; series engines had very few parts in common with the &quot;A&quot;.. Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s internal variant identification incorporated the series letter as part of the designation, for example Double Wasp S1A4-G (&quot;A&quot; series) and Double Wasp CB17 (&quot;C&quot; series).

;Note:Suffixes such as -S14A-G denote engines developed for export to other countries.

&quot;Data from White (Airlife) unless otherwise noted:&quot;

===Military===
The dash number for each military type (e.g.: -21) was allocated to identify the complete engine model in accordance with the specification under which the engine was manufactured. Thus dash numbers did not necessarily indicate the sequence in which the engines were manufactured. For example: the -18W was a &quot;C&quot; series engine, built from 1945, whereas the -21 was a &quot;B&quot; series engine, built from 1943.

Until 1940 the armed forces adhered strictly to the convention that engines built for the Army Air Forces used engine model numbers with odd numeric suffixes (e.g.: -5), while those built for the US Navy used even (e.g.: -8). After 1940, however, in the interests of standardization, engines were sometimes built to a joint Army-Navy contract, in which case the engines used a common numeric suffix (e.g. the -10 was used by both Army and Navy aircraft.)

The suffix W e.g.: -10W denotes a sub-series modified to use water injection. The &quot;Anti-Detonant Injection&quot; (ADI) system injected a mixture of water and methanol into the carburetor to increase power for short periods. Several models of the R-2800s were fitted with ADI as standard equipment and were not given the W suffix. Few commercial aircraft used water injection.

<text>Obersturmbannführer (Senior Assault-unit Leader; ; short: Ostubaf) was a paramilitary rank in the German Nazi Party (NSDAP) which was used by the SA (&quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;) and the SS (&quot;Schutzstaffel&quot;). The rank of &quot;&quot; was junior to the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot;, and was equivalent to the military rank of &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; (lieutenant colonel) in the German Army. 

As the SA expanded, the rank of &quot;Ostubaf&quot; was created in May 1933 to provide a rank above &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot;; likewise, the &quot;Ostubaf&quot; was an SS rank. The &quot;&quot; rank insignia was composed of four silver pips and a black stripe on a silver background, all elements are centered in the left wing of the collar of the tunic of an SS or of an SA uniform. The rank also was worn on the shoulder boards of an &quot;Oberstleutnant&quot; and was the highest rank in the SS and the SA to display SS unit insignia on the collar wing opposite the rank insignia.

Various Waffen-SS units composed of foreign recruits were considered distinct from the German SS, and thus they were not permitted to wear SS runes on their collar tabs but had their divisional insignia instead. Their ranks were also prepended with &quot;Waffen&quot; instead of &quot;SS&quot;, as in, &quot;Waffen-&quot;.

== Adolf Eichmann ==
In 1940, Adolf Eichmann was promoted to &#x27;, and was listed as such in the minutes of the Wannsee Conference held in January 1942. In 1961, during the Eichmann trial for Lt. Col. Eichmann&#x27;s crimes against humanity, the chief prosecutor, Gideon Hausner, drew attention to the executive significance and command responsibility of the rank of &#x27;, in response to Eichmann&#x27;s claim that he was merely a clerk obeying orders; Hausner asked, &quot;Were you an &quot;&quot; or an office girl?&quot;

In the book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; (1963) the political theoretician Hannah Arendt said that was not a rank of significance, because Eichmann whiled away the war time awaiting promotion to the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot;. That &quot;people like Eichmann, who had risen from the ranks, were never permitted to advance beyond a lieutenant colonel [i.e. &quot;&quot;] except at the front&quot;, in combat with the enemy.

<doc id="673184" wikidata="Q192855" url="?curid=673184" title="Alternative media">
<text>Alternative media are media sources that differ from established or dominant types of media (such as mainstream media or mass media) in terms of their content, production, or distribution. Sometimes the term &quot;independent media&quot; is used as a synonym, indicating independence from large media corporations, but generally independent media is used to describe a different meaning around freedom of the press and independence from government control. Alternative media does not refer to a specific format and may be inclusive of print, audio, film/video, online/digital and street art, among others. Some examples include the counter-culture zines of the 1960s, ethnic and indigenous media such as the First People&#x27;s television network in Canada (later rebranded Aboriginal Peoples Television Network), and more recently online open publishing journalism sites such as Indymedia.

In contrast to mainstream mass media, alternative media tend to be &quot;non-commercial projects that advocate the interests of those excluded from the mainstream&quot;, for example, the poor, political and ethnic minorities, labor groups, and LGBT identities. These media disseminate marginalized viewpoints, such as those heard in the progressive news program &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, and create communities of identity, as seen for example in the It Gets Better Project that was posted on YouTube in response to a rise in gay teen suicides at the time of its creation.

Alternative media challenge the dominant beliefs and values of a culture and have been described as &quot;counter-hegemonic&quot; by adherents of Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s theory of cultural hegemony; however, since the definition of alternative media as merely counter to the mainstream is limiting, some approaches to the study of alternative media also address the question of how and where these media are created, as well as the dynamic relationship between the media and the participants that create and use them.

==Definitions==
There are various definitions of &quot;alternative media&quot;. John Downing, for example, defines &quot;radical alternative media&quot; as media &quot;that express an alternative vision to hegemonic policies, priorities, and perspectives&quot;. In his assessment of a variety of definitions for the term, Chris Atton notes repeatedly the importance of alternative media production originating from small-scale, counter-hegemonic groups and individuals.

Christian Fuchs also argues that alternative media must have four distinct properties. The first being that the audience of these media must be involved in the creation of what is put out in alternative media. The second is that it has to be different from the mainstream. The third is that it should create a perspective different from that of the state and major corporations. The fourth property is that alternative media must &quot;establish different types of relationships with the market and/or the state.&quot;

As defined by Atton and Hamilton, &quot;Alternative journalism proceeds from dissatisfaction not only with the mainstream coverage of certain issues and topics but also with the epistemology of news. Its critique emphasizes alternatives to, inter alia,  conventions of news sources and representation; the inverted pyramid of news texts; the hierarchical and capitalized economy of commercial journalism; the professional, elite basis of journalism as a practice; the professional norm of objectivity; and the subordinate role of the audience as a receiver.&quot;

Journalistic Practices says &quot;Alternative media not only allow but also facilitate the participation (in its more radical meaning) of its members (or the community) in both the produced content and the content-producing organization.&#x27; In this sense, participation in alternative media as described and reflected upon by the participants in this study can best be understood as a form of active citizenship&quot;.

== Common approaches and practices ==
Approaches to the academic study of alternative media attempt to understand the ways in which these media are significant, each emphasizing a different aspect of media, including the role of the public sphere, social movements, and the participation by communities that create the media.

== Democratic theory and the public sphere ==

One way of understanding alternative media is to consider their role in the process of democratic communication. Philosopher Jürgen Habermas proposed that a healthy democratic community requires a space where rational debate can take place between engaged citizens. It is essential that the dialogue in this public sphere occurs outside the control of any authority so that citizens can exchange ideas as equals. This translates to the need for free speech and a free press.

In Habermas&#x27;s idea of the public sphere, participation is open to everyone, all participants are considered equal, and any issue can be raised for debate. However, this view fails to note the inherent exclusion of women and minorities (and their interests) from the debate in the public sphere. In light of this social inequality, philosopher Nancy Fraser argues for the importance of multiple independent public spheres, in which members of subordinated groups can first deliberate their issues and concerns among themselves and later assert those issues into the larger public sphere. The alternative media associated with these counter-public spheres are critical in developing the needs and identity of the group and in challenging the larger dominant public sphere. A feminist counter-public sphere is, for example, responsible for circulating the view that women&#x27;s issues such as domestic abuse and reproductive rights are deserving of debate in the larger public sphere.

== Social movement media ==
Social movements are a type of collective action. They involve large, sometimes informal, groups or organizations which focus on specific political or social issues and promote, instigate, resist or undo the social change. Social movement media is how social movements use media, and oftentimes, due to the nature of social movements, that media tends to be an alternative.

Communication is vital to the success of social movements. Research shows that social movements experience significant difficulties communicating through mainstream media because the mainstream media often systematically distort, stigmatize, or ignore social movement viewpoints. They may deny social movements&#x27; access or
representation at critical moments in their development, employ message frames that undermine or weaken public perceptions of a movement&#x27;s legitimacy or implicitly encourage movement actors who seek coverage to cater to the questionable values of mainstream reportage on social activism, including a heightened interest in violence, emotionality, and slogans. This problematic coverage of social movements is often referred to as the protest paradigm: the idea that mass media marginalizes protest groups through their depictions of the protesters, and, by doing so, subsequently support the status quo. As a result, social movements often turn to alternative media forms and practices in
order to more effectively achieve their goals.

An example of how the mainstream media problematically covers social movements is the Occupy movement, which began with Occupy Wall Street in September 2011. The Occupy movement protested against social and economic inequality around the world, its primary goal being to make the economic and political relations in all societies less vertically hierarchical and more flatly distributed. Among the movement&#x27;s primary concerns is the system which allows large corporations and the global financial system to manipulate the world in a way that disproportionately benefits a wealthy minority, undermines democracy, and disregards environmental sustainability. In comparing the mainstream news coverage of the Occupy movement against coverage from alternative press several trends emerge. First, mainstream media used confusion over the event as the dominant frame while alternative media focused on what the demonstrators were actually trying to accomplish. Second, the mainstream media placed the protesters at fault of any violence while the alternative media focused on the brutality of the police and their violent acts on the peaceful protesters.

For more information about social movements, and alternative media, see social movement theory.

Alternative media tend to be activist by nature. Social movements in areas such as human rights, the environmental movement, and civil rights produce alternative media to further their goals, spread awareness, and inspire participation and support.

== Human rights ==

An example of a human rights social movement using
alternative media is the group WITNESS. WITNESS is a human rights non-profit
organization and its mission is to partner with on-the-ground organizations to support the documentation of human rights violations and their consequences, in order to further public engagement, policy change, and justice. They rely on video recordings using technology such as handheld camcorders and smartphones to capture the world&#x27;s attention and viscerally communicate human rights abuses. They have documented human rights abuses from the police in the &quot;favelas&quot; of Brazil, children soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human trafficking in Brazil and the United States, and many other human rights issues, all through the use of alternative media.

== Environmental movement ==

An example of an environment movement using alternative media is the group Greenpeace. Greenpeace is a non-governmental environmental organization whose goal is to &quot;ensure the ability of the Earth to nurture life in all its diversity and focuses its campaigning on worldwide issues such as climate change, deforestation, overfishing, commercial whaling, genetic engineering, and anti-nuclear issues. It uses direct action, lobbying, and research to achieve its goals, as well as alternative media. They use online tactics such as podcasts and blogs as well as performance art.

== Civil rights ==
An example of a civil rights group using alternative media was the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). SNCC was one of the most important organizations of the American Civil Rights Movement in
the 1960s. SNCC was involved in voter registration rights in the south, established Freedom Schools, organized the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), among many other accomplishments. Alternative media tactics used by SNCC included establishing a dedicated Communication Section which included a photography arm, its own printing press (which published its newsletter the Student Voice), published publicity materials, and created an alternative wire press.

== Participatory culture ==
Alternative media have frequently been studied as a manifestation of participatory culture, in which citizens do not act as consumers only, but as contributors or producers as well. By opening up access to media production, participatory culture is believed to further democracy, civic engagement, and creative expression.

Participatory culture pre-dates the Internet. Amateur Press Associations are a form of participatory culture that emerged late in the 19th century. Members of such associations typeset and print their own publications, which are mailed through a network of subscribers. Zines, community-supported radio stations, and other types of projects were predecessors of blogs, podcasts, wikis, and social networks. Web services such as Tumblr, Imgur, Reddit, Medium, TikTok, and YouTube, among others, allow users to distribute original content to wider audiences, which makes media production more participatory.

Alternative media are also created by participatory journalism as citizens play an active role in collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating news and information. This form of alternative and activist news-gathering and reporting functions outside of mainstream media institutions, often as a response to the shortcomings of professional journalism. It engages in journalistic practices but is driven by goals other than profit making, has different ideals, and relies on alternative sources of legitimacy.

Participatory media approaches consider participation in producing media content as well as in making decisions about media production processes as a defining feature of alternative media. Participatory culture can be realized in a number of ways. Media literacy is a way to begin participating by understanding media systems&#x27; conventions and means of production. Individuals learning to produce media themselves is the step that moves citizens from literacy to participation. Fan fiction, community radio (or low-power FM), and hyper-local blogging are just a few ways that citizens can produce media content to participate in the production of alternative media.

By fostering participation, alternative media contribute to the strengthening of a civic attitude and allow citizens to be active in one of the main spheres relevant to daily life and to put their right to communication into practice. To demonstrate the relationship between democracy and participation in media production, the term citizen&#x27;s media illustrates that alternative media can help those who are producing media also become active citizens – particularly in a democracy. This idea is tied very closely to community media (see next section).

== Community media ==
Community media includes citizens′ media, participatory media, activist and radical media as well as the broader forms of communication in which local or regional specific platforms are engaged. Like other forms of alternative media, community media seeks to bypass the commercialization of media. The elimination or avoidance of sole ownership or sponsorship is motivated by a desire to be free of oversight or obligation to cater to a specific agenda. Community media is often categorized as grassroots, a description that applies to both the financial structure and the process of content creation. While there is diversity in community media, which varies by media platform (radio, TV, web or print), it is typical that the media source is open to the public/community to submit material and content. This open policy aligns with the values of community media to maintain a democratic approach and ethos. Historically community media has served to provide an alternative political voice. Across the world forms of community, media are used to elevate the needs and discourse of a specific space, typically connected by geographical, cultural, social, or economic similarities.

== Race and indigenous media ==
Minority community media can be both localized and national, serving to disseminate information to a targeted demographic. They provide a platform for discussion and exchange within the minority communities as well as between the minority and the majority communities. Oftentimes minority-focused media serves an essential resource, providing their audiences with essential information, in their own language of origin, helping the specified group to participate as equal citizens of their country of residence. These media platforms and outlets create an opportunity for cultural exchange and the elevation or empowerment of a disenfranchised or marginalized group, based on racial, ethnic or cultural identity. Historically, these forms of media have served a dual purpose, to disseminate information to a community that is traditionally ignored or overlooked by major media outlets and as a vehicle for political protest or social reform.

Spaces created to address minority discourse typically straddle the line of both alternative and activist media, working to provide a resource unavailable through mainstream measures and to shift the universally accepted perspective or understanding of a specific group of people. Sociologist Yu Shi&#x27;s exploration of alternative media provides opposing arguments about the role of minority media to both facilitate cultural place-making and hinder community assimilation and acculturation. Shi expounds a widely shared understanding that racially informed media provide a place, power, and political agency.

Throughout the 20th-century, media spaces were developed to accommodate the growing multi-cultural state of the United States. African-Americans created local publications like the Chicago Defender to share critical information to protect citizens from discriminatory practices by police and policy-makers, while Jet and Ebony&#x27;s magazine served to empower the national black identity, lauding the achievements and thought leadership of Black Americans. Similar practices became increasingly common for Latino/Latina and Asian groups. As immigration increased post-1965, Spanish-language newspapers and television stations, along with the creation of television networks like ICN-TV specifically for Chinese immigrants. A critical awareness of an increasingly participatory global media culture in multicultural societies is becoming widespread and a necessary approach to explaining the success and impact of ethnic or minority media, as well as to embrace the changing ways in which people &#x27;use&#x27; their media.

== Connections to subaltern studies ==
There are related aims found in alternative media studies and subaltern studies, as a concern for disenfranchised and oppressed voices pervades both fields. Subaltern studies draw on Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s discussion of &quot;subaltern&quot; groups, that is, groups of people considered to be of inferior rank socially, economically, and politically. One of the most significant questions in subaltern studies is posed by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, &quot;Can the subaltern speak?&quot; which she asks in her seminal essay of the same name. Spivak investigates whether the subaltern has a voice within hegemonic political discourses, and if so if their voices are being heard, allowing them to participate. This is important, as the subaltern&#x27;s ability to participate in politics and other social and cultural practices is key in establishing—as well as challenging—their subaltern status. This particular body of scholarship is useful to the study and discussion of alternative media due to their shared preoccupation with the ability of disenfranchised peoples to participate and contribute to mainstream hegemonic discourses, especially in regards to ethnic and racial media in which these groups speak from a subaltern position.

This connection is strengthened in the work of alternative media scholar Clemencia Rodriguez. In her discussion of citizenship, Rodriguez comments that &quot;Citizens have to enact their citizenship on a day-to-day basis, through their participation in everyday political practices...As citizens actively participate in actions that reshape their own identities, the identities of others, and their social environments, they produce power.&quot; So it could be said that by subaltern groups creating alternative media, they are indeed expressing their citizenship, producing their power, and letting their voice be heard.

==Forms of media==

===Press – print===
The alternative press consists of printed publications that provide a different or dissident viewpoint than that provided by major mainstream and corporate newspapers, magazines, and other print media.

&quot;Factsheet Five&quot; publisher Mike Gunderloy described the alternative press as &quot;sort of the &#x27;grown-up&#x27; underground press. &quot;Whole Earth&quot;, the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, and &quot;Mother Jones&quot; are the sorts of things that fall in this classification.&quot; In contrast, Gunderloy described the underground press as &quot;the real thing, before it gets slick, co-opted, and profitable. The underground press comes out in small quantities, is often illegible, treads on the thin ice of unmentionable subjects, and never carries ads for designer jeans.&quot;

An example of alternative media is tactical media, which uses &#x27;hit-and-run&#x27; tactics to bring attention to an emerging problem. Often tactical media attempts to expose large corporations that control sources of mainstream media.

One prominent NGO dedicated to tactical media practices and info-activism is the Tactical Technology Collective which assists human rights advocates in using technology. They have released several toolkits freely to the global community, including NGO In A Box South Asia, which assists in the setting up the framework of a self-sustaining NGO, Security-In-A-Box, a collection of software to keep data secure and safe for NGOs operating in potentially hostile political climates, and their new short form toolkit 10 Tactics, which &quot;... provides original and artful ways for rights advocates to capture attention and communicate a cause&quot;.

== Radio ==
Radio has been a significant form of alternative media due to its low cost, ease of use, and near ubiquity. Alternative radio has arisen in response to capitalist and/or state-sponsored mainstream radio broadcasts. For example, in early 1970s Australia, a new alternative radio sector was created by those who felt excluded from the two-sector national broadcasting system, consisting of a national public service broadcaster and commercial services. In the US, the first listener-supported independent station, KPFA, began in 1949 in order to provide an avenue for free speech unconstrained by the commercial interests that characterized mainstream radio.

Their content ranges broadly; while some stations&#x27; primary aims are explicitly political and radical, others namely seek to broadcast music that they believe to be excluded from mainstream radio. Alternative radio often, though not always, takes the form of community radio, which is generally understood as participatory, open, non-profit, and made by and for a community. These radio stations may broadcast legally or illegally, as pirate radio. Alternative radio is a global phenomenon. Examples of community and alternative radio endeavors include Tilos Rádió (Hungary), Missinipi Broadcasting Corporation (Canada), Pacifica Radio and the Prometheus Radio Project (both in the United States), and Radio Sagarmatha (Nepal).

== Video and film ==
Alternative film and video are generally produced outside of the mainstream film and video industries and features content and/or style that is rarely seen in mainstream product. However, its particular genre, content, and form vary widely. It is often produced in non-profit organizational contexts, such as video art collectives (e.g. Videotage, Los Angeles Filmmakers&#x27; Cooperative) or grassroots social justice organizations (e.g. Line Break, CINEP—Center for Research and Popular Education). Participatory video projects in which marginalized or under-resourced groups tell their stories through video demonstrate the possibility for access and participation in video-making to empower those involved, circulate representations unseen in mainstream media, and challenge existing power relations.

Alternative film in the United States is evident in the work of The Film &amp; Photo League chapters of the 1930s, which drew attention to union and class issues through social documentary film and the editing of newsreels. Though initiated in the 1960s and 1970s, radical video making reached an apex in the 1980s, as technology became more accessible. Public access television provided a broadcast outlet for oftentimes punk and hip-hop-influenced radical cultural critique. Deep Dish TV, for instance, is a television network which seeks to provide media access to grassroots organizations and to marginalized or misrepresented perspectives through public access television. Today, portable, accessible recording technology and the internet allow increasing opportunities for global participation in the production, consumption, and exchange of alternative video content.

== Internet ==
With the increasing importance attributed to digital technologies, questions have arisen about where digital media fit in the dichotomy between alternative and mainstream media. First, blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other similar sites, while not necessarily created to be information media, increasingly are being used to spread news and information, potentially acting as alternative media as they allow ordinary citizens to bypass the gatekeepers of traditional, mainstream media and share the information and perspectives these citizens deem important.

Second, the Internet provides an alternative space for mobilization through the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible. Typically, among those with deviant, dissident or non-traditional views, Internet platforms allow for the creation of new, alternative communities that can provide a voice for those normally marginalized by the mainstream media.

In addition, the Internet has also led to an alternative form of programming, which allows both professionals and amateurs to subvert or evade commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies. Some examples of alternative computing are hacking, open source software or systems, and file sharing.

Lastly, the Internet also breeds a new way of creation and dissemination of knowledge—commons knowledge—that is different from the top-down manner. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies. Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre.

== Street art ==
Often considered guerilla-art, street art operates free from the confines of the formal art world. In the form of graffiti, stencil, mural, and print, street art appropriates or alters public spaces as a means of protest and social commentary. Important aspects of street art as an alternative form are its blend of aesthetics and social engagement, use of urban spaces, and interaction with the social landscape of the area in which the art is made.

The street art movement gained popularity in the 1980s as a form of art distinct from high art and commercial venues, but as popularity grew, some street artists moved from the alternative venues of the streets to gallery and museum showings. Cities such as Paris, Buenos Aires, and São Paulo rose to prominence in using street art as legitimate alternative media through artist collectives and competitions, bringing attention to alternative voices. The internet has also influenced street art greatly by functioning as a platform for artists and fans to share pictures of street art from around the world. Websites like Streetsy.com and WoosterCollective.com are among the most popular of street art sharing sites.

== Performance ==
Performance as an alternative medium uses theater, song, and performance art as a means of engaging audiences and furthering social agendas. Performance art is an avant garde art form that typically uses live performances to challenge traditional forms of visual art. It operates as &quot;the antithesis of theatre, challenging orthodox art forms and cultural norms.&quot; Playing an important role in social and cultural movements from Dada and Surrealism to Post-Minimalism, performance art reflects the political environment of the time. While performance art is often relegated to high art, street theater is typically used in a grassroots fashion, utilizing local communities for performance or conversation. It can be used as a form of guerilla theater to protest, like in the case of The Living Theatre which is dedicated to transforming the hierarchy of power in society through experimental theater.

== Music ==
Certain genres of music and musical performance can be categorized as alternative media. Independent music, or indie music, is music that is produced separate from commercial record labels. Professor David Hesmondhalgh describes indie music&#x27;s alternative nature as a &quot;hard-headed network of post-punk companies which made significant challenges to the commercial organization of cultural production favoured by the major record companies.&quot; Its subversive roots of sound or lyrics and alternative models of distribution distinguish it from the commercial record companies.

==Genres==
Some alternative media can be associated with the political left in the United States, the political right in the United States, and various political positions in the United Kingdom.

Primarily concerned with the growing role of new media in alternative media projects, communication scholar Leah Lievrouw identifies five genres of contemporary new media based alternative and activist media: culture jamming, alternative computing, participatory journalism, mediated mobilization, and commons knowledge.

*Culture jamming generally attempts to critique popular cultures such as entertainment, advertising, and art. It tends to comment on issues of corporate capitalism and consumerism and seeks to provide political commentary. Characteristics of culture jamming texts include the appropriation or repurposing of images, video, sound, or text and that they are ironic or satirical in some sense. Today, culture jamming can come in the form of internet memes and guerrilla marketing.
*Alternative computing deals with the material infrastructure of informational and communications technologies. It seeks to critique and reconfigure systems with the intention of subverting or evading commercial and political restraints on open access to information and information technologies. Some examples of alternative computing are hacking, open source software or systems, and file sharing.
*Participatory journalism refers to web-based sources of critical or radical news either in the form of online news services or blogs. These alternative outlets of news often adopt the philosophies of citizen journalism and view themselves as providing an alternative to mainstream news and opinion. Participatory journalism projects may cover underreported groups and issues. Within this genre authors and readers of some of these alternative media projects have the ability contribute alike and therefore has the characteristic of being participatory or interactive. An example of participatory journalism is Indymedia and wearecgange.org
*Mobilization media relate to communication practices that mobilization or organization social movements, identity, or cultural projects through the use of new media tools and platforms such as Facebook or YouTube. Characteristics of this genre include the cultivation of interpersonal networks, collective action towards social change, and making information much readily accessible.
*Commons knowledge as a genre refers to projects that provide alternatives to the traditional top-down creation and dissemination of knowledge. It seeks out and encourages the participation of multiple users, fostering forms of collaborative knowledge production and folksonomies. Wikipedia is an excellent example of this genre.

Thinking of current forms of alternative media in terms of the genre not only allows one to identify the features and conventions of certain modes of communication, but also how &quot;they allow people to express themselves appropriately, and to achieve their various purposes or intentions.&quot; In other words, one can begin to understand how the creators and participants of alternative new media projects actively shape their communication practices.

YouTube is considered to be not only a commercial enterprise but also a platform designed to encourage cultural participation by ordinary citizens. Although YouTube aimed to be foremost a commercial enterprise, nevertheless, it has become a community media as one of the forms of alternative media. Scholars assume that YouTube&#x27;s commercial drive may have increased the probability of participation in online video culture for a broader spectrum of participants than before. This idea allows one to shift our concern away from the false contradiction between market-driven and non-market-driven culture towards the tensions between corporate logics and unruly and emergent traits of participatory culture, and the limits of YouTube model for cross-cultural diversity and global communication. In theory, YouTube stands as a site of cosmopolitan cultural citizenship. Uploading foreign soap opera episodes and dividing into several pieces to pass YouTube&#x27;s content limits, can be seen as acts of cultural citizenship similar to the media sharing practices of diverse communities identified by Cunningham and Nguyen (2000). However, people who have the highest chance of encountering other cultural citizens are those who have the access to various contents, information and platforms; this is commonly referred to as the &#x27;participation gap&#x27;. The notion of participation gap makes both digital literacy and digital divide such important issues for cultural politics. Therefore, it is still controversial whether YouTube is just another conduit for strengthening cultural imperialism or one of the alternative media.

==Aesthetics==
In association with experimental and innovative modes of production and collaboration, aesthetics in alternative media can be a political tool used to subvert dominant power. Like many makers of alternative media, scholar Crispin Sartwell identifies politics as an aesthetic environment. As such, these art political systems not only use aesthetics as a tool to gain power but are also produced via aesthetic forms within all media. Thus, it is not uncommon for alternative media to seek new artistic, non-traditional, or avant-garde means to represent its content. In this case, the use of aesthetics allows alternative media to address otherwise banal content in a manner which re-aligns, re-negotiates, or exposes the politics at work within it.

== Form ==
Scholars have linked the Avant-garde art movements as one arena where alternative aesthetics are used as a political tool. Movements such as Futurism, Dada, and Situationism looked to challenge the formal rules regarding what art was, how it looked or sounded like, or where it could be in order to radically alter public and political ideology. The logic, reason, and rules of style and beauty, mandated by the dominant class, was rejected as an affirmation of subjugation.

== Appropriation ==
While some alternative makers look to radically break away from the suffocating restraints of the dominant class by rejecting their dominant visual dogma, others appropriate, twist, and remix in order to subvert dominant language and messaging through mimicry, mockery, and satire. The détournement (and its successor culture-jamming) of the Situationists, the mimicry of Pop Art, and the reworking of normative narratives in slash fiction are examples of appropriation of mainstream media texts.

== Participation ==
Avant-garde movements that have emphasized audience participation include Futurism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Situationism, Pop art, Neo-concretism, and the Theatre of the Oppressed. By inviting the audience to participate in the creation of media, collaborators look to subvert or critique hierarchical structures (capitalism, the ivory tower) within society by embracing democratic modes of production. Strategies that involve the input or collaboration of all stakeholders often result in less formally &#x27;correct&#x27; aesthetics.
