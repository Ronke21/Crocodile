<doc id="683996" wikidata="Q5333670" url="?curid=683996" title="Economy of England">
<text>The economy of England is the largest economy of the four countries of the United Kingdom. England&#x27;s economy is one of the largest and most dynamic in the world, with an average GDP per capita of £37,852 in 2022.

His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is responsible for developing and executing the government&#x27;s public finance policy and economic policy. Government involvement is also primarily exercised by the Department for Business and Trade and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. Regarded as a highly developed social market economy, it has adopted many free market principles, yet maintains an advanced social welfare infrastructure.

England is a highly industrialised country. It is a leader in the high-tech, chemical and pharmaceutical sectors and in key technical industries, particularly aerospace, the arms industry, and the manufacturing side of the software industry. It is also an important producer of textiles and chemical products. Although automobiles, locomotives, and aircraft are among England&#x27;s other important industrial products, a significant proportion of the country&#x27;s income comes from the City of London and its financial hubs, banking, insurance, investment management and other related financial services. The UK technology sector is valued at US$1 trillion, third behind the United States and China, mostly based in England.

The service sector of the economy is largest in England and one the largest in Europe. Construction industry, technology, and business services continue to produce economic growth, provided mainly by the growing services, administrative and financial sectors. Creative industries (arts, film production, product, fashion, design, music, IT, etc.) remain important to the national economy, with England having the second largest creative industry sector in Europe.

In the 18th century, England was the first nation to industrialise. In common with most other advanced industrialised economies, England has seen a decline in the importance of both manufacturing industries and primary-based extractive industries. Since the 1990s, the financial services sector has played an increasingly significant role in the English economy and the City of London is one of the world&#x27;s largest financial centres. Banks, insurance companies, commodity and futures exchanges are heavily concentrated in the city.

The London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom&#x27;s main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England&#x27;s financial centre, with 100 of Europe&#x27;s 500 largest corporations being based there. The official currency in England is the pound sterling, whose ISO 4217 code is GBP. The &quot;pound sterling&quot; is the oldest currency in continuous use. Taxation in England is quite competitive when compared to much of the rest of Europe – the basic rate of personal tax is 20% on taxable income up to £31,865 above the personal tax-free allowance (normally £10,000), and 40% on any additional earnings above that amount.

England is a nation within the United Kingdom, which is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, the G7, the G8, the G20, the CPTPP, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the United Nations.

== GDP ==

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures are estimated (using a variety of means) for independent nations, and used to measure and compare aggregate (total) wealth between countries. Since England is not an independent state, but constitutes one of the four major nations of the UK (along with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland), there are fewer internationally comparable figures available.

== History ==
In medieval times (c. 11th–15th centuries), the wool trade was the major industry of England, and the country exported wool to Europe. Many market towns and ports grew up on the industry and flourished. Following the Black Death and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase; but it was less than 2 million in 1600. The growing population stimulated economic growth, accelerated the commercialisation of agriculture, increased the production and export of wool, encouraged trade and promoted the growth of London.

The high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th and early 16th centuries were replaced with low wages and a land shortage. Various inflationary pressures, perhaps due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population, set the stage for social upheaval, with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with manorial lords beginning the process of enclosure of village lands that previously had been open to everyone.

John Leland left rich descriptions of the local economies he witnessed during his travels from 1531 to 1560. He described markets, ports, industries, buildings and transport links. He showed that some small towns were expanding, through new commercial and industrial opportunities, especially cloth manufacture. He suggested that investment by entrepreneurs and benefactors had enabled some small towns to prosper. Taxation was a negative influence on economic growth, since it was imposed not on consumption, but on capital investments. Exports increased significantly and privately owned companies traded with the colonies in the West Indies, North America and India.

The Company of Merchant Adventurers of London brought together London&#x27;s leading overseas merchants in a regulated company in the early 15th century, in the nature of a guild. This enabled them to import a large range of foreign goods. Elizabethan England avoided major defeats and built up a powerful navy. On balance, it can be said that Elizabeth I provided the country with a long period of general if not total peace and generally increased prosperity due in large part to stealing from Spanish treasure ships, raiding settlements with weak defences, and selling African slaves. Having inherited a virtually bankrupt state from previous reigns, her policies restored fiscal responsibility. Her fiscal restraint cleared the regime of debt by 1574, and ten years later the Crown enjoyed a surplus of £300,000.

Under Elizabeth I crafts and manufacturing activities received a boost. Glass, ceramic, silk industry and exports of wool manufactures could be promoted. Economically, Sir Thomas Gresham&#x27;s founding of the Royal Exchange (1565), the first stock exchange in England and one of the earliest in Europe, proved to be a development of the first importance, for the economic development of England and soon for the world as a whole. With taxes lower than other European countries of the period, the economy expanded; with more wealth to go around at the end of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign than at the beginning. This general peace and prosperity allowed the attractive developments of the &quot;Golden Age&quot;.
===17th century===
In 1600, the queen chartered the East India Company (later the British East India Company) in an attempt to break the Spanish and Portuguese duopoly of Far Eastern trade. It established trading posts, which in later centuries evolved into British India, on the coasts of what are now India and Bangladesh. Larger scale colonisation in North America began shortly after Elizabeth&#x27;s death. Originally chartered as the &quot;Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies&quot;, the East India Company rose to account for half of the world&#x27;s trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, and opium. The Bank of England was established in 1694 by Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax to act as the English Government&#x27;s banker. It was primarily founded to fund the war effort against France. The king and queen at the time, William and Mary, were two of the original stockholders. The original Royal Charter of 1694, granted by King William and Queen Mary, explained that the Bank was founded to ‘promote the public Good and Benefit of our People’.
According to Derek Hirst, the 1640s and 1650s saw a revived economy with growth in manufacturing, the elaboration of financial and credit instruments, and the commercialisation of communication. The gentry found time for leisure activities, such as horse racing and bowling. In the high culture important innovations included the development of a mass market for music, increased scientific research, and an expansion of publishing. All the trends were discussed in depth at the newly established coffee houses.

England became one of the most prosperous economic regions in Europe between 1600 and 1700. Industrialisation in England from the mid-18th century resulted in economic developments described by many historians as the Industrial Revolution.

As a result, Great Britain was one of the premier economies in Europe throughout the 19th century, the most prominent industrial power in the world economy, and a major political power. Its industrialists were major innovators in machinery such as steam engines (for pumps, factories, railway locomotives and steamships), textile equipment, and tool-making. England pioneered the railway system, and built many systems and manufactured most of the equipment other nations used. Its businessmen were leaders in international commerce and banking, trade and shipping. Its markets included both areas that were independent and those that were part of the expanding British Empire. After 1840, an economic policy of mercantilism was abandoned and replaced by free trade, with few tariffs, quotas or restrictions. The powerful Royal Navy protected British commercial interests, shipping and international trade, while the British legal system enabled the resolution of disputes relatively inexpensively, and the City of London functioned as the economic capital and focus of the world economy.

== Sectors ==

=== Food and drink ===
The food and drinks industry is an important sector in England, worth £10.2 bn as of 2021, although this is down 9% from 2020 and 15% from 2019. Fruit and vegetable sales have been hit hardest, with sales down by 36%.

The top food and drinks export categories are:

* Agriculture and Fisheries
* Alcoholic beverages (such as gin, wine, and whisky) (£2.3 bn)
* Miscellaneous (£1.7 bn)
* Hot beverages (such as coffee and tea) and spices (£1.2 bn)
* Sugar and honey (£245.4 m)

The top export destination for food and drinks exports from England is Ireland with 15% of all exports at a value of £1.5bn in 2021; this is down by 25% from 2020. There were also increases in exports to France and the USA with exports up by 12% and 10% respectively, with Germany and the Netherlands also among the top five export markets for the English food and drink sector.

==== Agriculture and fishing ====
Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanised and efficient by European standards, producing 60% of food needs with only 2% of the labour force. Two-thirds of production is devoted to livestock, the other to arable crops. The main crops that are grown are wheat, barley, oats, potatoes, sugar beets. England retains a significant and large fishing industry. Its fleets bring home fish of every kind, ranging from sole to herring. It is also rich in natural resources including coal, petroleum, natural gas, tin, limestone, iron ore, salt, clay, chalk, gypsum, lead, and silica.

The United Kingdom fishing industry contributed £446 million in 2019 in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA); this represents 0.02% of the UK&#x27;s total GVA. In 2021, 53% of fishers were based in England and Wales, 40% in Scotland and 8% in Northern Ireland. The largest English region was the South West, contributing 10% of overall output in the sector.

The fishing industry in England catches a variety of different fish and seafood including North Sea Cod, North Sea Whiting, North Sea Haddock, Southern Sea Crab, West of Scotland Nephrops and Eastern English Channel Scallops.

The Environment Agency is a non-departmental public body, established in 1995 and sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with responsibilities relating to the protection and enhancement of the environment in England. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the minister responsible for environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries and rural communities in England.

==== Alcoholic beverages ====

In 2019 England sold 550,000 bottles of English wine to 50 countries worldwide, this is up from 256,000 in 2018.

In 2022 the total value of English wine exports was £9.6 million ($11.8 million) with 800,000 bottles sold.

Major English wine brands include: Ridgeview Bloomsbury, Bolney Wine Estate, Lyme Bay, Aldwick Court Farm, Hattingley Valley, Lyme Block, Chapel Down, Brightwell Vineyard, and Stopham Estate.

As of March 2021 there are more distilleries in England (311) than in Scotland (214); this is due to an increase in English gin sales which increased the number of English distilleries to over 300 for the first time.

As of 2023 there are currently 38,000 casks of English whisky maturing, with an estimated 50,000 casks expected to be laid down by 2024. The estimated value of the maturing whisky stock is £1bn.

Major English whisky brands include: English Whisky Co, Cotswolds, The Lakes, Bimber, The Oxford Artisan, and Dartmoor.

=== Industry ===
The leading industrial sectors in England are services, manufacturing, construction, agriculture, and tourism. The service industry in England comprises several key industries, including finance and business services, retail, food and beverage, and entertainment. The Industrial Revolution started in England with an initial concentration on the textile industry, followed by other heavy industries such as shipbuilding, coal mining and steelmaking. English merchants, shippers and bankers developed overwhelming advantage over those of other nations allowing the country to dominate international trade in the 19th century. Shipbuilding continues, between September 2021 and the end of 2022, the government announced £4.34 billion in shipbuilding contracts to UK companies. The UK also produces luxury boats from Princess, Sunseeker and Fairline. Manufacturing remains a significant part of the economy but accounted for only 16.7 per cent of national output in 2003.

The automotive industry employs around 800,000 people, with a turnover in 2015 of £70 billion, generating £34.6 billion of exports (11.8 per cent of the UK&#x27;s total export goods). In 2015, the UK produced around 1.6 million passenger vehicles and 94,500 commercial vehicles. England is a major centre for engine manufacturing: in 2015 around 2.4 million engines were produced. including luxury cars such as Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Range Rover. It is also the world&#x27;s fourth-largest exporter of engines, as of 2021.

The motorsport industry employs around 41,000 people, comprises around 4,500 companies and has an annual turnover of around £6 billion. 7 of the 10 Formula One teams are based in England, with their technology being used in supercars and hypercars from McLaren, Aston Martin and Lotus.

Research and development spending is also high in the UK. In 2019, total expenditure on R&amp;D was £38.5 billion. R&amp;D investment has risen steadily over the past few decades, from £20.4 billion in 1986 to the current total of £38.5 billion, an increase of 96%. England&#x27;s research and development funding and incentives and business infrastructure help support an environment of technology innovation.

The United Kingdom was ranked in the top 5 countries in the Global Innovation Index 2023. London has been named as the fastest growing technology hub in Europe, with England having over 100 unique tech companies with a value of $1 billion or more. A boom in investment in technology has led to tech and IT-related vacancies now making up 13% of all UK job vacancies. In Eastern England, overall hiring has increased by nearly 14% in the tech sector, and 12% in North West England and South West England. The UK technology sector is valued at US$1 trillion, third behind the United States and China, mostly based in England.

A growing number of technology companies are based in London, notably in East London Tech City also known as Silicon Roundabout. Investment in London&#x27;s technology sector was $2.28 billion in 2015, 69 per cent higher than the $1.3 billion raised in 2014. Since 2010, London-based technology companies have collectively raised $5.2 billion of venture capital funding. A report by EY highlighted the importance of London to the UK&#x27;s FinTech industry in terms of availability of expertise and demand for services.

The Haldane principle, that decisions about what to spend research funds on should be made by researchers rather than politicians, is influential in research policy. UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) is a non-departmental public body that directs research and innovation funding. There are several university departments with a focus on science policy, such as the Science Policy Research Unit. There are nine bodies in UKRI, comprising the seven research councils and two additional bodies, Innovate UK and Research England. Research England is responsible for the Research Excellence Framework. The research councils include:
* Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)
* Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
* Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)
* Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)
* Medical Research Council (MRC)
* Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
* Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)

The Department for Business and Trade and Secretary of State for Business and Trade has responsibility for business. The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, and Minister of State for Science, Research and Innovation has responsibility for science and innovation development in England.

=== Construction ===
The construction industry of England employed around 2 million people and contributed gross value of £123.2 billion to the economy in 2019.

One of the largest construction projects in England in recent years was Crossrail, costing an estimated £19 billion. Opened in 2022 by Queen Elizabeth II and named the Elizabeth line, it is a new railway line running east to west through London and into the surrounding area, with a branch to Heathrow Airport. It was the largest construction project in Europe. The main feature of the project is construction of 42 km (26 mi) of new tunnels connecting stations in central London. Ongoing construction projects include the High Speed 2 line between London and the West Midlands. Crossrail 2 is a proposed rail route in the South East of England.

=== Finance ===

The UK financial services industry added gross value of £116,363 million to the UK economy in 2011. England&#x27;s exports of financial and business services make a significant positive contribution towards the country&#x27;s balance of payments.
England&#x27;s capital houses the City of London, a major financial district, and one of the world&#x27;s leading financial centres. The City of London is a major business and financial centre, and the Bank of England is headquartered in the City of London. Throughout the 19th century, the City of London was the world&#x27;s primary business centre, and it continues to be a major meeting point for finance.The London Stock Exchange, the United Kingdom&#x27;s main stock exchange and the largest in Europe, is England&#x27;s financial centre, with 100 of Europe&#x27;s 500 largest corporations being based there. , the total market value of all companies trading on the London Stock Exchange was £3.8 trillion. It was founded in 1801, making it one of the oldest exchanges in the world. It is part of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).

There are over 500 banks with offices in London, and it is the leading international centre for banking and insurance, Eurobonds, foreign exchange trading and energy futures. London&#x27;s financial services industry is primarily based in the City of London and Canary Wharf. The City houses the London Metal Exchange, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, and the Bank of England.

Canary Wharf began development in the 1980s and is now home to major financial institutions such as Barclays Bank, Citigroup and HSBC, as well as the Financial Services Authority. Developed on the site of the former West India Docks, Canary Wharf contains large offices and banks. It comprises many open areas, including Cabot Square and Westferry Circus. After the London Docklands closed in 1980, the government adopted policies to stimulate redevelopment of the area, including the creation of the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC) in 1981 and the granting of Urban Enterprise Zone in 1982. London is also a major centre for other business and professional services, and four of the six largest law firms in the world are headquartered there.

Financial services in the United Kingdom contributed a gross value of £86 billion to the UK economy in 2004. It creates significant benefits for the England, UK, European and global economies. The industry employed around 1.2 million people in the third quarter of 2012. The estimated amount of total taxes paid by the Financial Services Sector in the year to 31 March 2012 is £63bn, 11.6% of the total UK government tax receipts.

Service industries, particularly banking, insurance, investment management, business services and other related financial services account by far for the largest proportion of GDP. Leeds is England&#x27;s second largest financial centre, with over 30 national and international banks based in the city. Over 124,000 people are employed in banking and financial services in Leeds, and over in the wider Leeds City Region. Manchester is the largest financial and professional services sector outside London and is the mid tier private equity capital of Europe.

=== Manufacturing ===
In the 1970s, manufacturing accounted for over 20 percent of the economy. Total employment in manufacturing fell from 7.1 million in 1979 to 4.5 million in 1992 and only 2.7 million in 2016, when it accounted for 10% of the economy. Manufacturing has increased in 36 of the last 50 years and was twice in 2007 what is in 1958.

In 2011 the UK manufacturing sector generated approximately £140,539 million in gross value added and employed around 2.6 million people. Of the approximately £16 billion invested in R&amp;D by UK businesses in 2008, approximately £12 billion was by manufacturing businesses, mostly located in England. In 2008, the UK was the sixth-largest manufacturer in the world measured by value of output.
The aerospace industry of the UK is the second- or third-largest aerospace industry in the world, depending upon the method of measurement. The industry employs around 113,000 people directly and around 276,000 indirectly and has an annual turnover of around £20 billion. English companies with a major presence in the industry include BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce (the world&#x27;s second-largest aircraft engine maker). European aerospace companies active in England and the UK include Airbus, whose commercial aircraft, space, helicopter and defence divisions employ over 13,500 people.

The pharmaceutical industry employs around 67,000 people in the UK and in 2007 contributed £8.4 billion to the UK&#x27;s GDP and invested a total of £3.9 billion in research and development. In 2007 exports of pharmaceutical products from the UK totalled £14.6 billion, creating a trade surplus in pharmaceutical products of £4.3 billion. England is home to GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, respectively the world&#x27;s third- and seventh-largest pharmaceutical companies. England remains a key player in the aerospace, defence, pharmaceutical and chemical industries, and English companies worldwide continue to have a role in the sector through foreign investment.

=== Renewable energy ===

Successive UK governments have outlined numerous commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. England is one of the best sites in Europe for wind energy, and wind power production is its fastest growing supply. The total of all renewable electricity sources provided 38.9 per cent of the electricity generated in the UK in the third quarter of 2019, producing 28.8 TWh of electricity. England is home to Hornsea 2, the largest offshore wind farm in the world, situated in waters roughly 89 kilometres off the coast of Yorkshire.

The Climate Change Act 2008 was passed in Parliament with an overwhelming majority across political parties. It sets out emission reduction targets that the UK must comply with legally. It represents the first global legally binding climate change mitigation target set by a country. In June 2017 renewables plus nuclear generated more UK power than gas and coal together for the first time and new offshore wind power became cheaper than new nuclear power for the first time.

Government energy policy aims to play a key role in limiting greenhouse gas emissions, whilst meeting energy demand. Shifting availabilities of resources and development of technologies also change the country&#x27;s energy mix through changes in costs. United Kingdom is ranked 2 out of 180 countries in the Environmental Performance Index. A law has been passed that greenhouse gas emissions will be net zero by 2050 in England. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) has said it would be affordable. The target for 2030 is a 68% reduction compared with 1990 levels. As part of an economic stimulus to attempt to get out of the COVID-19 recession a green industrial policy was announced. One of the methods of reducing emissions is the UK Emissions Trading Scheme. Businesses and employees are given tax breaks for electric cars and a much larger proportion of business vehicle purchases are electric than those of consumers.

=== Retail ===

By the 17th century, permanent shops with more regular trading hours were beginning to supplant markets and fairs as the main retail outlet. Provincial shopkeepers were active in almost every English market town. As the number of shops grew, they underwent a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century store, gradually made way for store interiors and shopfronts that are more familiar to modern shoppers.

Prior to the eighteenth century, the typical retail store had no counter, display cases, chairs, mirrors, changing rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.

Following the Great Fire of London (1666), the city of London was completely rebuilt. Shops were permitted in the principal street or &#x27;high street&#x27;, but not in the by-lanes or back streets. This may have been based on the need for high visibility in order to regulate retail trade, as well as to avoid congestion in the narrow lanes and back streets. Accordingly, from the 17th century, the term &quot;High Street&quot; gradually assumed a narrower meaning and came to describe thoroughfares with significant retail in large villages and towns. In the late 17th and 18th centuries, the number of High Streets increased markedly. The 19th century was a &quot;golden era&quot; for high street shops. The rise of the middle class in Victorian England contributed to a more favourable attitude to shopping and consumption. Shopping centres became places to see and be seen, for recreational shopping, and for promenading.

The retail sector in England includes the motor trade, auto repairs, personal and household goods industries. The sector added gross value of £151,785 million to the UK economy in 2011. As of 2016, high-street retail spending accounted for about 33% of consumer spending and 20% of GDP. Because 75% of goods bought in the United Kingdom are made overseas, the sector only accounts for 5.7% of gross value added to the British economy. Online sales account for 22% of retail spending in the UK, third highest in the world after China and South Korea, and double that of the United States.

The grocery market in England is dominated by four companies: Tesco (27% market share), Sainsbury&#x27;s (15.4%), Asda (14.9%) and Morrisons (10%), these supermarkets are known as the &quot;Big Four&quot;. However, supermarkets such as Aldi have grown in popularity. London is a major retail centre and in 2010 had the highest non-food retail sales of any city in the world, with a total spend of around £64.2 billion. Outside of London, Manchester and Birmingham are also major retail destinations, the UK is also home to many large out of town shopping centres like Meadowhall, away from the main high streets in town and city centres. Whilst the big international names dominate most towns and cities have streets or areas with many often quirky independent businesses. Tesco is the fourth-largest retailer in Europe measured by turnover.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism accounted for £96 billion of GDP (8.6% of the economy) in 2009. It employs over 2 million people – around 4% of the working population. England has a rich history in areas such as architecture, tradition, art and sport and is home to over 1,600 museums, most free of charge to visit.

English Heritage is a governmental body with a broad remit of managing the historic sites, artefacts and environments of England. It is currently sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Historic England (officially the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England) is an executive non-departmental public body. It is tasked with protecting the historic environment of England by preserving and listing historic buildings, scheduling ancient monuments, registering historic parks and gardens and by advising central and local government.

The National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty is a charity which also maintains multiple sites. Of the 25 United Kingdom UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 17 are in England. Some of the best known of these include Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites, Tower of London, Jurassic Coast, Palace of Westminster, Roman Baths, City of Bath, Saltaire, Ironbridge Gorge, Studley Royal Park and more recently the English Lake District. The northernmost point of the Roman Empire, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, is the largest Roman artefact anywhere: it runs for a total of 73 miles in northern England.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has responsibility for tourism, arts and culture, cultural property, heritage and historic environments, libraries, and museums and galleries in England. The largest centre for tourism is London, which attracted close to 20 million tourists in 2016 alone. The British Museum (featuring over 8 million objects in its vast collection) has served as a major tourist attraction with over 5,906,716 visitors in 2017 alone. It is largely considered a global centre of finance, art, and culture.

=== Transport and logistics ===
The Department for Transport is the government body responsible for overseeing transport in England. The department is run by the Secretary of State for Transport. The transport and storage industry added a gross value of £59,179 million to the UK economy in 2011 and the telecommunication industry added a gross value of £25,098 million in the same year.

England has a dense and modern transportation infrastructure. There are many motorways in England, and many other trunk roads, such as the A1 Great North Road, which runs through eastern England from London to Newcastle (much of this section is motorway) and onward to the Scottish border. The longest motorway in England is the M6, from Rugby through the North West up to the Anglo-Scottish border, a distance of . Other major routes include: the M1 from London to Leeds, the M25 which encircles London, the M60 which encircles Manchester, the M4 from London to South Wales, the M62 from Liverpool via Manchester to East Yorkshire, and the M5 from Birmingham to Bristol and the South West.

Figures from the Department for Transport show in 2018 people made 4.8 billion local bus passenger journeys in England, 58% of all public transport journeys. There were 1.8 billion rail passenger journeys in England. Light rail and tram travel also continued to grow, to the highest level (0.3 million journeys) since comparable records began in 1983. Rail travel tends to be used for longer journeys. Over half (57%) of all trips by rail are for either commuting or business purposes. On average, people made 48 trips by bus and travelled 441 kilometres compared to 22 trips and 992 kilometres by rail in 2018. In 2018/19, there was £18.1bn of public expenditure on railways, an increase of 12% (£1.9bn).

Bus transport across the country is widespread; major companies include Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, Mobico Group, Rotala and Stagecoach Group. The red double-decker buses in London have become a symbol of England. Rail transport in England is the oldest in the world: passenger railways originated in England in 1825. Much of Britain&#x27;s of rail network lies in England, covering the country fairly extensively. These lines are mostly standard gauge (single, double or quadruple track) though there are also a few narrow gauge lines. There is rail transport access to France and Belgium through an undersea rail link, the Channel Tunnel, which was completed in 1994.

During the age of steam locomotion, the economy in England strove to develop reliable technology for powering high-speed rail services between major cities. High-speed rail in England is provided on five upgraded railway lines running at top speeds of and one purpose-built high-speed line reaching . Trains currently travel at 125 mph (200 km/h) on the East Coast Main Line, Great Western Main Line, Midland Main Line, parts of the Cross Country Route, and the West Coast Main Line. High Speed 1 (HS1) line connects London to the Channel Tunnel, with international Eurostar services running from St Pancras International to cities in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands at 186 mph (300 km/h). HS1 line was finished on time and under budget. The line is also used by high-speed commuter services from Kent to the capital. The CTRL project saw new bridges and tunnels built, with a combined length nearly as long as the Channel Tunnel itself, and significant archaeological research undertaken. In 2002, the CTRL project was awarded the Major Project Award at the British Construction Industry Awards. Since 2019 construction has been ongoing on a major new purpose-built high-speed rail line, High Speed 2 (HS2) which will link London with Birmingham at and reduce journey times to Scotland.

Government-backed plans to provide east–west high-speed services between cities in the North of England are also in development, as part of the Northern Powerhouse Rail project to boost the economic activity of the North. In June 2014, the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed a high speed rail link High Speed 3 (HS3) between Liverpool and Newcastle, Sheffield and Hull. The line would utilise the existing route between Liverpool and Newcastle and Hull, and a new route from to Sheffield will follow the same route to Manchester Victoria, and then a new line from Victoria to Sheffield, with additional tunnels and other infrastructure. In July 2019 the Prime Minister announced a high-speed Leeds to Manchester route.

Great British Railways is a planned state-owned public body that will oversee rail transport in Great Britain. The Office of Rail and Road is responsible for the economic regulation of England&#x27;s railways. England has extensive domestic and international aviation links. The largest airport is Heathrow, which is the world&#x27;s busiest airport measured by number of international passengers. Other large airports include Gatwick, Manchester, Stansted, Luton and Birmingham.

=== Education ===
In 2007/08 higher education institutions in the UK had a total income of £23 billion and employed a total of 169,995 staff. In 2007/08 there were 2,306,000 higher education students in the UK with 1,922,180 studying in England.

English higher education has a strong international reputation, with over half of international students citing this as one of the main factors in deciding to study in the UK (compared to 22 percent of international students studying in Canada, 21 percent in Australia and 15 percent in the US). In specific subject rankings, English universities have performed well with a quarter of all top rankings taken by English universities in world rankings&quot;.&quot; The University of Oxford is rated top in most subjects among English universities, with the Royal College of Art first in the world for art and design, the Institute of Education, part of University College London, for education, University of Sussex for development studies and Loughborough University for sports-related subjects.

England&#x27;s universities include some of the highest-ranked universities in the world; University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Imperial College London, University College London and King&#x27;s College London are all ranked in the global top 30 in the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. The London School of Economics has been described as the world&#x27;s leading social science institution for both teaching and research. The London Business School is considered one of the world&#x27;s leading business schools and in 2010 its MBA programme was ranked best in the world by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

The University of Westminster achieved internationally excellent status for most of their work, ranking second for communications, cultural and media studies research, sixth for art and design research, in addition to the university performing strongly in architecture and the built environment, and geography and environmental studies. University of Manchester, University of Bristol, University of Liverpool and University of Birmingham are other English universities in global rankings.

The Department for Education is the government department responsible for issues affecting people in England up to the age of 19, including education. State-run and state-funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren. Education is the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Education. Children who are between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an Early Years Foundation Stage reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. State-funded schools are obliged by law to teach the National Curriculum.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of British 15-year-olds as 13th in the world in reading literacy, mathematics, and science with the average British student scoring 503.7, compared with the OECD average of 493. Out of the United Kingdom nations, England performed the strongest.

Further education colleges and sixth form colleges often form part of a secondary school site. Further education covers a wide curriculum of apprenticeships like BTEC Awards and NVQs. T Levels are apprenticeship based qualifications in England developed in collaboration with employers and businesses so that the content meets the needs of industry and prepares students for the labour market. Pupils gain a broad knowledge; with skills and behaviours necessary for employment in an occupation or industry related to their field of study, an opportunity to develop specialist technical skills relevant to at least one occupation, and the relevant English, Maths, Science and Digital skills. The pathways include:
* Agriculture, Environmental and Animal Care
* Business and Administrative
* Catering and Hospitality
* Childcare and Education
* Construction
* Creative and Design
* Digital
* Engineering and Manufacturing
* Hair and Beauty
* Health and Science
* Legal, Finance and Accounting
* Protective Services
* Sales, Marketing and Procurement
* Social Care
* Transport and Logistics
=== Healthcare ===
The National Health Service (NHS), is the publicly funded healthcare system responsible for providing the majority of healthcare in the country. The NHS began on 5 July 1948, putting into effect the provisions of the National Health Service Act 1946. It was based on the findings of the Beveridge Report, prepared by economist and social reformer William Beveridge. The NHS is largely funded from general taxation including National Insurance payments, and it provides most of its services free at the point of use. The government department responsible for the NHS is the Department of Health and Social Care, headed by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care.

The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom. The South of England has a higher life expectancy than the North, however, regional differences do seem to be slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993. The NHS in England is by far the largest of the four parts and had a turnover of £92.5 billion in 2008.

=== Creative industries ===
The creative industries accounted for 5.9% of the UK&#x27;s GVA in 2023, having grown by 43.6% over a decade. Key areas include London and the North West of England, which are the two largest creative industry clusters in Europe. According to the British Fashion Council, the fashion industry&#x27;s contribution to the economy in 2014 is £26 billion, up from £21 billion in 2009. London is one of the world&#x27;s leading fashion capitals.

England is also home to the world&#x27;s largest advertising company, WPP.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, headed by the headed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport is the department with responsibility for culture and sport in England, and building of the digital economy and creative industries. It also has responsibility for the tourism and leisure. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport definition recognises ten creative sectors, namely:
* Advertising and marketing
* Architecture
* Crafts
* Design: product, graphic and fashion design
* Film, TV productions, TV, video, radio and photography
* IT, software and computer services
* Publishing
* Copyright, patent, trademarks
* Museums, galleries and libraries
* Music, performing and visual arts

London dominates the media sector in England: national newspapers and television and radio are largely based there, although Manchester is also a significant national media centre. The University of Salford also has a media campus and research center based at MediaCity. The UK publishing sector, including books, directories and databases, journals, magazines and business media, newspapers and news agencies, has a combined turnover of around £20 billion and employs around 167,000 people.

The Creative Industries Federation is a national organisation for England&#x27;s creative industries, cultural education and arts. It advocates for the sector, aiming to ensure that the creative industries are central to political, economic and social decision making. Through this advocacy and by leveraging the combined influence of its 1,000+ members across all creative sectors, the Federation further seeks to secure the investment required to retain the creative industries&#x27; position as the fastest growing sector of the national economy, currently worth £111.7bn.

== Currency and taxation ==

England uses the pound sterling which is the world&#x27;s oldest currency that is still in use and that has been in continuous use. It is currently the fourth most-traded currency in the foreign exchange market and is the world&#x27;s fourth-largest reserve currency (after the United States dollar, euro, and yen). London is the world capital for foreign exchange trading, with a global market share of 38.1% in 2022 of the daily $7.5 trillion global turnover. Since 1997 the Bank of England&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee, headed by the Governor of the Bank of England, has been responsible for setting interest rates at the level necessary to achieve the overall inflation target for the economy that is set by the Chancellor each year.

Taxation in England involves payments to at least three different levels of government: central government (His Majesty&#x27;s Revenue and Customs) and local government. Central government revenues come primarily from income tax, National Insurance contributions, value added tax, corporation tax and fuel duty. Local government revenues come primarily from grants from central government funds, business rates in England, Council Tax and increasingly from fees and charges such as those for on-street parking. In the fiscal year 2014–15, total government revenue was forecast to be £648 billion, or 37.7 per cent of GDP, with net taxes and National Insurance contributions standing at £606 billion. Business rates were introduced in England in 1990 and are a modernised version of a system of rating that dates back to the Poor Relief Act 1601.

The Budget of His Majesty&#x27;s Government is an annual budget set by HM Treasury for the following financial year, with the revenues to be gathered by HM Revenue and Customs and the expenditures of the public sector, in compliance with government policy. The budget is one of two statements given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the Spring Statement being given the following year. Budgets are usually set once every year and are announced in the House of Commons by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since autumn 2017 the budget typically takes place in the Autumn in order to give notice of tax changes well before the start of each fiscal year.

== Regions and cities ==

Manchester is considered to be a &#x27;beta global city&#x27;, rated as the second most globally influential city in England after London. The region is now an economic knowledge-led centre, with research and enterprise clustered around the University of Manchester, where research ranked as the third most powerful in the UK behind Cambridge and Oxford. Typical industry areas include digital and creative, financial, legal and business services, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing, environmental technologies, tourism, global sports brands, media and real estate. The city is also a key location for many foreign owned companies and headquarters, and almost half of the Northwest&#x27;s top 500 businesses. Along with London, Manchester featured in the top 30 cities in the world for investment, and of the top 30, Manchester was 12th for the highest proportion of urban economy derived from financial and business services. Manchester City Council also plays a uniquely active role in business, where it owns key infrastructures such as bus services.

The economy in Liverpool is dominated by service sector industries, both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors. Public administration, education and health are combined, the single largest employment sector within Liverpool&#x27;s economy, accounting for approximately 40% of all jobs in the city. The level of employment in these sectors remains higher than the average for the other core cities of England. The banking, finance and insurance sectors are one of the fastest growing areas of Liverpool&#x27;s economy with a 5.3% increase in jobs in these areas 2006/07. Major private sector service industry concerns have also invested in Liverpool especially the financial services sector with Barclays, JPMorgan, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and the Bank of Ireland either opening or expanding their sites, a number of major call centres have opened in recent years too and the professional advice sector.

Birmingham is an important manufacturing and engineering centre, employing over 100,000 people in the industry and contributing billions of pounds to England&#x27;s economy. Research at the University of Birmingham, both theoretical and practical has contributed to the success of the city and the West Midlands region and had worldwide impact for more than a century. The university ranks as high as 10th in the UK according to the QS World University Rankings. Scientific research including research into nano technology at the University of Birmingham, is expanding in the city and will possibly play a part in the city&#x27;s economic future. In 2011, Birmingham&#x27;s financial and insurance services industry was worth £2.46 billion, the 4th largest in the United Kingdom. Birmingham has the two largest sets of barrister&#x27;s chambers in the country; a local law society; 50 major property firms and one of Europe&#x27;s largest insurance markets.

Leeds is the most diverse economy of all of England&#x27;s main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the core cities of England. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is the largest legal and financial centre in England outside of London. Its financial and insurance services industry was worth £2.1 billion, with more than 30 national and international banks located in the city. Leeds has nearly 1,800 companies engaged in a diverse range of manufacturing activities, including specialised engineering, print, food and drink manufacture, chemicals and medical technology. Both the University of Leeds and Leeds Metropolitan University have established business schools, their presence being supported by businesses in the city.

The economy in Bristol has long connections with the sea and its ports. In the 20th century aeronautics played an important role in the economy, and the city still plays a role in the manufacture of aircraft. Bristol was the first UK city to be named European Green Capital. Its modern economy is built on the creative media, technology, electronics and aerospace industries. Bristol is also a tourist destination, and has significant media, information technology and financial services sectors. Reports released in 2018 showed that the city is growing exponentially with a projected 2.3 percent annual growth rate.

In 2008, Sheffield ranked among the top 10 cities in the UK as a business location, and aims to regenerate itself as a modern technology and sports based city. Sheffield was the first National City of Sport, with a range of high quality facilities. Sheffield has an international reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. It was this industry that established it as one of England&#x27;s main industrial cities during the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. High technology businesses such Fluent, Inc. have chosen Sheffield as the centre for their international operations and so has Jennic, specialists in semiconductor design for the home automation, commercial building automation, and industrial process monitoring and control markets. The University of Sheffield supports the growth of technology transfer in the Sheffield City Region through the innovation centers which houses enterprises as well as startup companys working in similar areas alongside the University of Sheffield. Organised by the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Sheffield Business Awards is an awards ceremony held on an annual basis to help highlight and promote business and industry in Sheffield and boost the economy of the region.

Newcastle played a major role during the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, and was a leading centre for coal mining, shipbuilding, engineering, munitions and manufacturing. Heavy industries in Newcastle declined in the second half of the 20th century; with office, service and retail employment now becoming the city&#x27;s staples. Newcastle is the commercial, educational and the cultural hub of North East England. Newcastle&#x27;s economy contributes around £13 billion to the UK GVA. This figure is mostly produced by corporate activity in Newcastle&#x27;s Central Business District, located in the centre of the city (bounded by the Haymarket, Central Station and the Quayside areas). The city&#x27;s thriving nightlife is estimated to be worth £340 million per year, and consequently is seen as a major contributor to Newcastle&#x27;s economy. The UK&#x27;s first biotechnology village, the Centre for Life, is located by Central Station. The village is the first step in the City Council&#x27;s plans to transform Newcastle into a science city.

<text>The Damned (Götterdämmerung) () is a 1969 historical-drama film directed and co-written by Luchino Visconti, and starring Dirk Bogarde, Ingrid Thulin, Helmut Berger, Helmut Griem, Umberto Orsini, Charlotte Rampling, Florinda Bolkan, Reinhard Kolldehoff and Albrecht Schönhals in his final film. Set in 1930s Germany, the film centers on the Essenbecks, a wealthy industrialist family who have begun doing business with the Nazi Party, and whose amoral and unstable heir, Martin (played by Berger in his breakthrough role), is embroiled in his family&#x27;s machinations. It is loosely based on the German Krupp family of steel industrialists from Essen.

Principal photography of &quot;The Damned&quot; took place in locations throughout Italy, West Germany, and Austria. The film opened to widespread critical acclaim, but also faced controversy from ratings boards for its sexual content. In the United States, the film was given an X rating by the MPAA, which was lowered to a more marketable R after 12 minutes of offending footage were cut.

Visconti won the Nastro d&#x27;Argento for Best Director, and was nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Oscar with co-writers Nicola Badalucco and Enrico Medioli. Helmut Berger received a Golden Globe nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. The film won the Golden Peacock (Best Film) at the 4th International Film Festival of India.

==Plot==
In Germany in early 1933, the Essenbecks are a wealthy and powerful industrialist family who have, reluctantly, begun doing business with the newly-elected Nazi government. On the night of the birthday of the family&#x27;s conservative patriarch, Baron Joachim von Essenbeck, a member of the old German nobility who detests the upstart Adolf Hitler, the family&#x27;s children have prepared performances. Joachim&#x27;s grandnephew Günther plays a classical piece on his cello, while his grandson Martin performs a drag performance, which is interrupted by news that the Reichstag is burning. Assuming Hitler will use this incident to seize even greater control, Joachim announces at dinner that he is replacing Herbert Thallman, an outspoken anti-Nazi who is married to Joachim&#x27;s niece Elizabeth, with his boorish and unscrupulous nephew Konstantin, who is an officer in the SA, as vice president of the family steelworks.

Martin&#x27;s possessive mother, Sophie, has been in a relationship with Friedrich Bruckmann, an ambitious executive of the steelworks, for some time, but he has not proposed because he worries Joachim would not approve of him as the husband of the widow of Joachim&#x27;s beloved son. Friedrich is friendly with Aschenbach, an Essenbeck relation who has attained a high position in the SS, and, acting on Aschenbach&#x27;s suggestions that things would be better for him if the anti-Nazi Joachim were to die, Friederich kills Joachim and frames Herbert for the crime by using his personal handgun. Herbert narrowly escapes abroad, but, in his haste, is forced to leave behind Elizabeth and their two daughters. Martin inherits the majority of shares in the steelworks, and Sophie manipulates him into placing Friedrich, rather than Konstantin, in charge.

Aschenbach convinces Friedrich and Martin to bar their company from selling weapons to the SA, in hopes of marginalizing the rival group and currying the favor of the army, whose might Hitler will need in order to conquer territories beyond the current German borders. Konstantin discovers Martin has been sexually abusing his nieces and Lisa Keller, a young Jewish neighbor of Martin&#x27;s girlfriend who commits suicide, and he uses this information to resume providing the SA with weapons and get Martin to call a meeting to place him in charge of the company. Sophie finds Martin hiding in the attic of the family castle and, mostly for Friedrich&#x27;s sake, agrees to help free him from Konstantin&#x27;s blackmail. She meets up with Aschenbach, who reveals that Hitler is planning to purge the SA, as he feels its work securing Nazi power in Germany is done, but its leader, Ernst Röhm, is unlikely to quietly let it take a back seat to the SS and army.

Many high-ranking members of the SA, including Konstantin, gather at a hotel in Bad Wiessee. They have a drunken celebration, and the evening ends with the officers engaging in sex with one another. At dawn, the hotel is stormed by SS troops, who slaughter the SA members. Konstantin is personally executed by Friedrich, whom Aschenbach brought along to make him do his own dirty work.

Friedrich is now in control of the steelworks, and Sophie even gets Aschenbach to arrange a decree that gives him her father-in-law&#x27;s last name and royal title of Baron so they will be able to marry as equals. He is affected by all of his newfound power, and Aschenbach begins to feel that he is not displaying the appropriate subservience to National Socialism, so Aschenbach offers to help Martin destroy Sophie and Friedrich. Martin accepts, as he is bitter that his mother has used him to benefit Friedrich and herself.

During a family dinner, Friedrich announces that Aschenbach, Günther, and Martin must submit themselves to his will and whims, since he is now the head of the family. Herbert surprises everyone when he enters and reveals that, although Sophie had supposedly made arrangements for Elizabeth and her daughters to join Herbert in exile, they were really arrested and sent to Dachau, where Elizabeth died. Now a broken man, Herbert has returned to confess to murdering Joachim, in exchange for the release of his daughters. Günther, upset by this news, is enraged when Martin reveals that Friedrich killed Konstantin, and Aschenbach is able to use his hate to radicalize him to the Nazi cause.

Martin sexually assaults his mother, and she falls into a catatonic state. Without her help to strategize against Aschenbach and Martin, Friedrich is lost. Martin, who is now part of the SS, gets Friedrich and Sophie to go through the motions of getting married before ordering them to take cyanide capsules, which they willingly consume, killing them both. He inherits control of the steelworks, and the Essenbeck empire thereby comes under Nazi control.

==Cast==
==&quot;The German Trilogy&quot;==
&quot;The Damned&quot; has been regarded as the first of Visconti&#x27;s films described as &quot;The German Trilogy&quot;, followed by &quot;Death in Venice&quot; (1971) and &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1973), and the character Aschenbach even shares the same name as the protagonist of Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Death in Venice&quot;. Author Henry Bacon, in his book &quot;Visconti: Explorations of Beauty and Decay&quot; (1998), specifically categorizes these films together in a chapter titled &quot;Visconti &amp; Germany&quot;.

Visconti&#x27;s earlier films had analyzed Italian society during the Risorgimento and post-WWII periods. Peter Bondanella&#x27;s &quot;Italian Cinema&quot; (2002) depicts the trilogy as a move to take a broader view of European politics and culture. He says that, stylistically, &quot;they emphasize lavish sets and costumes, sensuous lighting, painstakingly slow camerawork, and a penchant for imagery reflecting subjective states or symbolic values.&quot;

==Production==

The film was shot on-location in West Germany and Austria, and at Cinecittà Studios in Rome. Locations included Düsseldorf, Essen, and Unterach am Attersee - the latter doubling for Bad Wiessee. The scenes of the Essenbeck steelworks were shot in Terni, Italy.

&quot;The Damned&quot; was the breakthrough film for Helmut Berger, who is given an &quot;Introducing&quot; credit, even though he had already appeared in Visconti&#x27;s segment of the anthology film &quot;The Witches&quot;. At the time, Berger was in a romantic relationship with Visconti. Dirk Bogarde later expressed disappointment with Visconti for sacrificing his character&#x27;s development to place a greater focus on Berger&#x27;s Martin. In his memoirs, Bogarde specifically cites a long scene showing Friedrich becoming overwhelmed with guilt after murdering Joachim, which was filmed, but cut.

Composer Maurice Jarre was hired by the producers without the knowledge of Visconti, who originally wanted the film scored entirely with pre-existing classical music by Gustav Mahler and Richard Wagner. Visconti reportedly was dissatisfied with the composer&#x27;s efforts, which he compared disparagingly to Jarre&#x27;s work on &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;, but was forced to use the music due to contractual obligations.

In Visconti&#x27;s preferred, primarily English-language version of the film, most of the cast members provide their own voices, but Umberto Orsini is dubbed by an uncredited actor, due to his accent.

Nazi war criminal Karl Hass appeared in the film as an extra. Hass was a perpetrator of the Ardeatine massacre, but was not charged or convicted until 1998, allegedly due to his work as an American agent against the Soviet Union in the 1950s. It&#x27;s unknown if the filmmakers were aware of Hass&#x27; identity when he appeared in the film, though some sources suggest he was employed as a technical advisor. Hass did appear as an extra in several other Italian films during the 1960s and &#x27;70s, including two about the Ardeatine massacre.

==Reception==
&quot;The Damned&quot; was released to worldwide acclaim. It was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 42nd Academy Awards, and was named one of the Top Foreign Films of 1969 by the National Board of Review. Among the international cast, Helmut Berger was singled out for his performance as Martin, a vicious sexual deviant who uses his amoral appetites to achieve his own twisted ends. The film was the tenth-most popular release at the French box office in 1970.

Retrospectively, the film has appeared on such critics&#x27; lists as &quot;The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; and &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Top 1000: The Ultimate Movie Countdown&quot;.

The film&#x27;s entry in the &quot;Lexikon des Internationalen Films&quot; praises its presentation of the connection between &quot;moral decadence, sexual neurosis, aestheticist death wish, narcissist self-centeredness and political opportunism&quot;, but comments that this effect is weakened somewhat by the film&#x27;s &quot;decorative circuitousness and artificial stylisation&quot;.

Filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder called &quot;The Damned&quot; his favorite film. He said it is &quot;perhaps the greatest film, the film that I think means as much to the history of film as Shakespeare to the history of theater&quot;.

===Censorship and ratings===
After the first screening of the film, 12 minutes were cut, including the scene where Lisa hangs herself after being molested. For the initial American release, much of the Bad Wiessee/Night of the Long Knives sequence was cut.

In 1969, the film was given an &quot;X&quot; rating by the MPAA due to a nude incest scene. Warner Bros. submitted the film for re-classification before releasing it on DVD in 2004, and the rating was changed to &quot;R&quot;.

The film was shown on CBS television late at night in the early 1970s. It had to be so heavily edited that one executive reportedly joked it should be retitled &quot;The Darned&quot;, but, technically, it was the first X-rated film to be shown on American network television.

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD by Warner Home Video in 2004. A 2K restoration of the film by the Cineteca di Bologna and Institut Lumière was released on Blu-ray and DVD by The Criterion Collection on 28 September 2021. All of the previously-censored footage was restored to the film for both of these home video releases.

<text>U.S. Route 31 or U.S. Highway 31 (US 31) is a major north–south U.S. highway connecting southern Alabama to northern Michigan. Its southern terminus is at an intersection with US 90/US 98 in Spanish Fort, Alabama. Its northern terminus is at an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) south of Mackinaw City, Michigan.

US 31 once crossed the Straits of Mackinac by car ferry to intersect US 2 north of St. Ignace, Michigan, in the Upper Peninsula and then formerly reached Mackinaw City along the southern approaches of the Mackinac Bridge (which has been taken over by I-75). It also formerly entered downtown Mobile, Alabama, via a long bridge over Mobile Bay.

The southern segment of US 31 connects the cities of Mobile, Montgomery, Birmingham, and Decatur in Alabama, and Nashville in Tennessee. The northern segment of US 31 connects Louisville in Kentucky, and Indianapolis in Indiana. From Nashville to Louisville, US 31 is signed U.S. Route 31W and U.S. Route 31E. From the Mobile Bay area in Alabama to Indianapolis, US 31 travels parallel to Interstate 65 (I-65).

==Route description==

===Alabama===
US 31 begins in Spanish Fort, Alabama at a junction with US 90 and 98. Formerly, the route originated in Mobile, co-routed with US 90 and 98. Whereas Interstate 65 leaves the Mobile Metropolitan Area via a route on the west side of the city, US 31 leaves the Mobile area via a route on the eastern side of the metro area, passing through Bay Minette. I-65 has effectively replaced US 31 as the preferred route for through traffic, making US 31 a local connecting route.

Near Atmore, the route passes extremely close to the Florida Panhandle&#x27;s extreme northwestern corner, missing by approximately 1000 feet.
At Flomaton, US 31 begins a 15-mile virtual east–west concurrency with US 29 that continues to Brewton. North of Brewton, US 31 assumes a northeast–southwest trajectory, passing through rural areas and small towns in Escambia and Conecuh Counties. In Evergreen, US 31 north and US 84 share a brief concurrency heading north and east out of town.

Although US 31 parallels Interstate 65 throughout Alabama, the two routes do not directly junction each other until they reach Pintlala in southern Montgomery County, which is 164 miles north of Mobile. The two routes do not junction each other again for another 22 miles. US 31 is routed along a bypass of Montgomery, the state capital. At Prattville, this route intersects U.S. Route 82.

North of Prattville, US 31 passes through rural areas of Autauga and Chilton Counties, primarily along two-lane roadways. Between Prattville and Alabaster, US 31 has three interchanges with I-65.

Between Saginaw and Warrior, US 31 is routed along multi-laned routes as it passes through the Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area. It passes through suburbs such as Alabaster, Pelham, Hoover and Vestavia Hills. In Homewood, US 31 merges with U.S. Route 280 and is routed along the Elton B. Stephens Expressway, a 2.6-mile limited access highway that connects the south suburbs with downtown Birmingham. US 31 and 280 are co-routed until the expressway junctions I-20/ 59 just northeast of downtown. This interchange serves as the western terminus of US 280, and north of the interchange US 31 is routed along surface streets as it proceeds northwardly out of Birmingham.

US 31 continues to be routed along multi-lane streets and highways as it continues north of Birmingham, meeting the eastern terminus of I-22 just south of Fultondale, and passing through the small town, along with Gardendale, Morris and Kimberly, also closely paralleling I-65. At Warrior, the roadway shrinks to two lanes. Two miles north of Warrior, US 31 and I-65 begin a three-mile concurrency between the interstate route&#x27;s Exits 284 and 287. The interstate route was constructed over US 31&#x27;s roadway through this segment.

Between the split from I-65 and Garden City, US 31 is routed along a narrow two-lane route. North of Garden City, and passing through Cullman, Hartselle, Decatur and Athens, it is routed along multi-lane and often divided roadways.
At Athens, I-65 and US 31 begin a concurrency that continues to just north of the Tennessee state line. In both states, US 31 is largely unsigned.

In addition to junctions previously cited, US 31 junctions U.S. Route 80 in Montgomery, Interstate 459 in Hoover, U.S. Route 78 in Birmingham, U.S. Route 278 in Cullman, U.S. Route 72 Alternate in Decatur, and U.S. Route 72 in Athens.

Given US 31&#x27;s former importance as a major connecting route in Alabama, in several cities it is known by the name of the city it leads to. For example, south of Montgomery it is still named Mobile Highway, and northwardly it is referred to as the Birmingham Highway. Similarly, south of Birmingham it is referred to as Montgomery Highway, and northwardly it is referred to as the Decatur Highway. Throughout north Alabama plaques and signage refer to the route as the Beeline Highway.

US 31 is co-routed with unsigned State Route 3 (SR 3) throughout the state until its junction with I-65 north of Athens.

===Tennessee===

The first mile in Tennessee, US 31 runs concurrently with I-65, somewhat parallel to which it runs until it splits in downtown Nashville, to become US 31W and US 31E, a relatively uncommon occurrence in U.S. Highways, though not unlike that which occurs to US 49 and US 45 in Mississippi, U.S. Route 19 in North Carolina and Tennessee, and US 11 in Tennessee.

While upon crossing the state line from Alabama into Tennessee, US 31 (also State Route 7 [SR 7] at this point) runs to the east of I-65, it crosses over I-65, changing names from Main Street to Elkton Pike on the overpass. According to this name change, US 31 runs through Elkton shortly after making this crossing.

After passing through Elkton, US 31 wanders, away from I-65, towards the city of Pulaski. On its way to Pulaski, US 31 intersects with US 64 and does so once again in the center of the city. In Pulaski, US 31 serves as 1st Street in the downtown area. Just north of the downtown area of Pulaski, US 31 Alternate (US 31A) branches off US 31, serving first as East Grigsby Street, then as Lewisburg Highway, never to be visible from US 31 again until reaching downtown Nashville.

Continuing north, US 31 meanders, following Richland Creek for a portion of the way, named Columbia Highway; naturally, as follows the typical naming trend for former connecting routes, halfway to Columbia, the name changes to Pulaski Highway. US 31 runs by Lynnville in this process.

As US 31 enters Columbia, upon crossing James Campbell Boulevard (also SR 50), it is named Carmack Boulevard, at this point a decently wide road with two lanes on each side. While in Columbia, US 31 changes names two more times, once to South Garden Street (also temporarily sharing routes with US 412 and SR 99 in this area), and then to Nashville Highway while SR 7 departs from the street. It is a short stretch until US 31 hits an intersection with Bear Creek Pike. This is the northern terminus of US 43, and also the point at which US 412/SR 99 resumes its eastern trajectory, away from US 31. US 31 also picks up the path of SR 6 here, in addition to the historical significance of being the former warpath of the Confederate forces during 1863 and 1864, during the American Civil War.

Upon leaving Columbia, US 31 develops a median and a speed limit not too dissimilar from that on I-65, which is still only a few miles to the east of the highway. On the way up to Spring Hill, US 31 passes straight through a small, corner town little-known to be called Neapolis. At this location, there is an on-ramp onto Saturn Pkwy (SR 396), named as such because it was once a highway connecting I-65 to the assembly plant belonging to Saturn Corporation, which no longer acts independently from its parent company, General Motors. No more than two miles further up the highway, Saturn Pkwy has looped back around to begin its trajectory toward I-65, and there are more on and off ramps between SR 396 and US 31.

At this point, US 31 returns to its original two-lane, narrow road format, and has entered the rapidly-growing city of Spring Hill, where it serves as Main Street, then as Columbia Pike in the adjacent Thompson&#x27;s Station.

North of Thompson&#x27;s Station, US 31 intersects I-840, serving as exit 28 for the southern loop around Nashville. Further up the highway, US 31 shares an interchange with Goose Creek Pike, a direct route to I-65. US 31 continues up through historic Franklin, as Columbia Avenue. In the middle of Franklin, US 31 comes to a five-point intersection with the routes of US 431 and SR 96, and a roundabout two blocks further north which continues the route of SR 96 to the east. US 31 then proceeds out of Franklin and to the northeast.

As US 31 passes through Brentwood, the road widens, again to two lanes per side, and intersects with SR 254 at the point where it reaches less than a half of a mile from I-65 once again. At this point, US 31 remains within this distance from I-65 until reaching its split in downtown Nashville, traveling through the sites of the Battle of Franklin and the Battle of Nashville in the process.

Entering Nashville, US 31 first shares an interchange with SR 155 (at this point Thompson Lane / Woodmont Boulevard), and, immediately afterwards, travels under an interchange between I-65 and I-440. After passing through Berry Hill, US 31 yet again travels under an interchange, this time between I-65 and I-40. Then, US 31 reaches another roundabout, where it intersects with US41, US 31A, and US 70S. Going through Nashville, US 31 retains several names: 8th Avenue South, Rosa L Parks Boulevard, James Robertson Pkwy, and 4th Avenue North, respectively as US 31 progresses northward. After making a semi-circle, crossing the Cumberland River, and passing under I-24, US 31 makes the split into US 31W and US 31E.

===Kentucky===
US 31E stays east of I-65, passing through Glasgow and Bardstown. It enters Louisville from the southeast, where it is named Bardstown Road for most of its length in the city, while US 31W closely follows I-65 from the Tennessee state line, through Bowling Green, to Elizabethtown. From here, it diverges to the west and passes through Fort Knox. North of Fort Knox, US 31W joins with US 60 in Kentucky and it roughly follows the Ohio River into Louisville. In southwestern Louisville, US 31W is called Dixie Highway. It is the major commercial street in this area.

In Downtown Louisville at Second Street, US 31E and US 31W rejoin to form US 31 and immediately crosses the Ohio River on the Clark Memorial Bridge only traveling before the route crosses into Indiana.

===Indiana===
US 31 travels concurrent with I-65 in Jeffersonville, after having crossed the Ohio River from Kentucky. It splits off north of Jeffersonville at Clarksville and proceeds to Indianapolis. At I-465 on the south side of Indianapolis, US 31 is now routed onto I-465 on the east side of the city. US 31 exits I-465 in extreme southern Hamilton County, and continues northward. US 31 then passes through or near Carmel, Kokomo, Rochester, Plymouth and Lakeville, often following a historic Native American trail to what was once a French fur-trading outpost on Mackinac Island and later the British Fort Holmes. As it passes Potato Creek State Park and approaches southern South Bend, US 31 travels concurrent with US 20 in Indiana and proceeds west then northward on the St. Joseph Valley Parkway, bypassing South Bend and proceeding into Michigan.

===Michigan===
US 31 follows the St. Joseph Valley Parkway northward into southern Michigan to an interchange with I-94 near Benton Harbor–St. Joseph, then runs concurrently north to I-196. US 31 then runs concurrently with I-196 along the shore of Lake Michigan north to the Holland area. US 31 departs from I-196 as a divided highway with many Michigan lefts north to Grand Haven, where it becomes a freeway again. This freeway continues northward through the Muskegon area until Ludington, where the freeway ends and US 31 turns east concurrently with US 10 to Scottville before turning northward again toward Manistee.

At Beulah, US 31 runs eastward into Grand Traverse County. South of Traverse City, US 31 turns northward along M-37, running concurrently into the city. Next to Grand Traverse Bay, US 31/M-37 turns easterly along M-72; the three highways run together along the bay before separating. M-37 turns northward up the Old Mission Peninsula, and M-72 turns easterly at Acme. US 31 continues northward along the eastern shore of Grand Traverse Bay, running eastward through Charlevoix and along Little Traverse Bay into Petoskey. There, US 31 intersects the northern end of US 131 before rounding the bay and heading northward and inland toward Mackinaw City. US 31 ends at a directional interchange with I-75 south of Mackinaw City.

==History==

In the 1930s, US 31 continued from St. Ignace across the Straits of Mackinac, and intersected US 2 (Mackinac Trail and what later became M-123).

Before the Interstate era, US 31 was a major north–south highway. I-65 supplanted US 31 and either US 31W or US 31E as a through route between Mobile and Indianapolis. South of Indianapolis, all segments of US 31 not traveling concurrently with I-65 have been reduced to roads largely of local use. I-196 now carries the route of US 31 between Holland, and St. Joseph, Michigan. All of US 31 between Indianapolis and Ludington, Michigan, is divided highway—some of it is freeway, including a bypass route of South Bend, Indiana. The segment between Indianapolis and South Bend is scheduled for upgrade or replacement with Interstate-standard freeway. Environmental impact studies have shown that the fifth phase of the then-to-be-constructed freeway segment between Napier Avenue near Benton Harbor, Michigan, and I-94 would be completed in mid-November 2022; the segment officially opened on November 9.

The portion of I-75 north of US 31&#x27;s northern terminus toward the Mackinac Bridge was designated part of US 31 prior to the 1990s and was US 31&#x27;s northernmost portion to be built to freeway status. Since its truncation at the I-75 interchange, however, the northernmost segment of the US 31 freeway ends near Ludington.

Until 1975, the split of US 31 into US 31E and US 31W took place in Sellersburg, Indiana about north of its current split at the Kentucky end of the Clark Memorial Bridge.

In Alabama, US 31 follows portions of the Pulaski Pike beginning at the Alabama–Tennessee State line at Ardmore, and was originally routed on what is now called Alabama State Route 251 (SR-251). It follows roughly along the Decatur Stage Road to the site of Rhodes Ferry in Decatur, and also intersected and follows portions of the Stouts Road to Birmingham. From Birmingham, it follows portions of the Columbiana Road and roughly parallels it in Hoover along the present widened route and intersects with the Ashville-Montevallo Road or the Cahaba Trail (SR-119) and follows it on a branch to Calera. US 31, beginning in Chilton County, follows a branch of the Talladega-Montgomery Stage Road, a road that went from Talladega and went south from Columbiana to near present-day Clanton, Verbena, and Montgomery, and was operated by Jemison, Ficklin, &amp; Powell, who operated stagecoaches on the road. US 31 in Prattville came to the site of Reese&#x27;s Ferry on the Alabama River, where it was replaced by the present bridge near Prattville. From Montgomery, US 31 follows parts of the Federal Road, and is presently routed on the Greenville Branch of the Federal Road, and follows the Montgomery-Mobile Road through Conecuh, and Escambia Counties and also intersects with the Pensacola Trading Path or the &quot;Old Wolf Trail&quot; from Burnt Corn.

At its southern end, US 31 originally traveled further west than it currently does, passing through Spanish Fort, Alabama. It crossed Mobile Bay via several narrow bridges, including the Admiral Raphael Semmes Bridge, a drawbridge spanning the Tensaw River. It turned north along the east bank of the Mobile River, crossing the river into Plateau, over the former Cochrane Bridge, another old drawbridge where the current Cochrane–Africatown USA Bridge is now located. It then turned south to end at US 90. It now officially ends at US 98 in Spanish Fort.

<doc id="684031" wikidata="Q370512" url="?curid=684031" title="Johannes Tinctoris">
<text>Jehan le Taintenier or Jean Teinturier (Latinised as Johannes Tinctoris; also Jean de Vaerwere; – 1511) was a Renaissance music theorist and composer from the Low Countries. Up to his time, he is perhaps the most significant European writer on music since Guido of Arezzo.

==Life and career==
He is known to have studied in Orléans, and to have been master of the choir there; he also may have been director of choirboys at Chartres. Because he was paid through the office of &quot;petites vicars&quot; at Cambrai Cathedral for four months in 1460, it has been speculated that he studied with Du Fay, who spent the last part of his life there; certainly Tinctoris must at least have known the elder Burgundian there. Tinctoris went to Naples about 1472 and spent most of the rest of his life in Italy.

Tinctoris was also known as a cleric, a poet, a mathematician, and a lawyer; there is even one reference to him as an accomplished painter.

==Works==
Tinctoris published many volumes of writings on music. While they are not particularly original, borrowing heavily from ancient writers (including Boethius, Isidore of Seville, and others) they give an impressively detailed record of the technical practices and procedures used by composers of the day. He wrote the first dictionary of musical terms (the &quot;Diffinitorium musices&quot;); a book on the characteristics of the musical modes; a treatise on proportions; and three books on counterpoint, which is particularly useful in charting the development of voice-leading and harmony in the transitional period between Du Fay and Josquin. The writings by Tinctoris were influential on composers and other music theorists for the remainder of the Renaissance.

While not much of the music of Tinctoris has survived, that which has survived shows a love for complex, smoothly flowing polyphony, as well as a liking for unusually low &quot;tessituras,&quot; occasionally descending in the bass voice to the C two octaves below middle C (showing an interesting similarity to Ockeghem in this regard). Tinctoris wrote masses, motets and a few chansons.

==Tinctoris&#x27; eight rules of composition==
From his third book on counterpoint.

Rule #1 Begin and finish with perfect consonance. It is, however, not wrong if the singer is improvising a counterpoint and ends with imperfect consonance, but in that case, the movement should be many-voiced. Sixth or octave doubling of the bass is not allowed.

Rule #2 Follow together with ténor up and down in imperfect and perfect consonances of the same kind. (Parallels at the third and sixth are recommended, fifth and octave parallels are forbidden.)

Rule #3 If ténor remains on the same note, you can add both perfect and imperfect consonances.

Rule #4 The counterpointed part should have a melodic closed form even if ténor makes big leaps.

Rule #5 Do not put cadence on a note if it ruins the development of the melody.

Rule #6 It is forbidden to repeat the same melodic turn above a &quot;cantus firmus&quot;, especially if the cantus firmus contains that same repetition.

Rule #7 Avoid two or more consecutive cadences of the same pitch even if &quot;cantus firmus&quot; allows it.

Rule #8 In all counterpoint, try to achieve manifoldness and variety by altering measure, tempo, and cadences. Use syncopes, imitations, canons, and pauses. But remember that an ordinary chanson uses fewer different styles than a motet and a motet uses fewer different styles than a mass.

==Musical Compositions==

<doc id="684037" wikidata="Q2814650" url="?curid=684037" title="Austerity">
<text>In economic policy, austerity is a set of political-economic policies that aim to reduce government budget deficits through spending cuts, tax increases, or a combination of both. There are three primary types of austerity measures: higher taxes to fund spending, raising taxes while cutting spending, and lower taxes and lower government spending. Austerity measures are often used by governments that find it difficult to borrow or meet their existing obligations to pay back loans. The measures are meant to reduce the budget deficit by bringing government revenues closer to expenditures. Proponents of these measures state that this reduces the amount of borrowing required and may also demonstrate a government&#x27;s fiscal discipline to creditors and credit rating agencies and make borrowing easier and cheaper as a result.

In most macroeconomic models, austerity policies which reduce government spending lead to increased unemployment in the short term. These reductions in employment usually occur directly in the public sector and indirectly in the private sector. Where austerity policies are enacted using tax increases, these can reduce consumption by cutting household disposable income. Reduced government spending can reduce gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the short term as government expenditure is itself a component of GDP. In the longer term, reduced government spending can reduce GDP growth if, for example, cuts to education spending leave a country&#x27;s workforce less able to do high-skilled jobs or if cuts to infrastructure investment impose greater costs on business than they saved through lower taxes. In both cases, if reduced government spending leads to reduced GDP growth, austerity may lead to a higher debt-to-GDP ratio than the alternative of the government running a higher budget deficit. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, austerity measures in many European countries were followed by rising unemployment and slower GDP growth. The result was increased debt-to-GDP ratios despite reductions in budget deficits.

Theoretically in some cases, particularly when the output gap is low, austerity can have the opposite effect and stimulate economic growth. For example, when an economy is operating at or near capacity, higher short-term deficit spending (stimulus) can cause interest rates to rise, resulting in a reduction in private investment, which in turn reduces economic growth. Where there is excess capacity, the stimulus can result in an increase in employment and output. Alberto Alesina, Carlo Favero, and Francesco Giavazzi argue that austerity can be expansionary in situations where government reduction in spending is offset by greater increases in aggregate demand (private consumption, private investment, and exports).

== History ==
The origin of modern austerity measures is mostly undocumented among academics. During the United States occupation of Haiti that began in 1915, the United States utilized austerity policies where American corporations received a low tax rate while Haitians saw their taxes increase, with a forced labor system creating a &quot;corporate paradise&quot; in occupied Haiti. Another historical example of contemporary austerity is Fascist Italy during a liberal period of the economy from 1922 to 1925. The fascist government utilized austerity policies to prevent the democratization of Italy following World War I, with Luigi Einaudi, Maffeo Pantaleoni, Umberto Ricci and Alberto de&#x27; Stefani leading this movement. Austerity measures used by the Weimar Republic of Germany were unpopular and contributed towards the increased support for the Nazi Party in the 1930s.

==Justifications==
Austerity measures are typically pursued if there is a threat that a government cannot honour its debt obligations. This may occur when a government has borrowed in currencies that it has no right to issue, for example a South American country that borrows in US dollars. It may also occur if a country uses the currency of an independent central bank that is legally restricted from buying government debt, for example in the Eurozone.

In such a situation, banks and investors may lose confidence in a government&#x27;s ability or willingness to pay, and either refuse to roll over existing debts, or demand extremely high interest rates. International financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) may demand austerity measures as part of Structural Adjustment Programmes when acting as lender of last resort.

Austerity policies may also appeal to the wealthier class of creditors, who prefer low inflation and the higher probability of payback on their government securities by less profligate governments. More recently austerity has been pursued after governments became highly indebted by assuming private debts following banking crises. (This occurred after Ireland assumed the debts of its private banking sector during the European debt crisis. This rescue of the private sector resulted in calls to cut back the profligacy of the public sector.)

According to Mark Blyth, the concept of austerity emerged in the 20th century, when large states acquired sizable budgets. However, Blyth argues that the theories and sensibilities about the role of the state and capitalist markets that underline austerity emerged from the 17th century onwards. Austerity is grounded in liberal economics&#x27; view of the state and sovereign debt as deeply problematic. Blyth traces the discourse of austerity back to John Locke&#x27;s theory of private property and derivative theory of the state, David Hume&#x27;s ideas about money and the virtue of merchants, and Adam Smith&#x27;s theories on economic growth and taxes. On the basis of classic liberal ideas, austerity emerged as a doctrine of neoliberalism in the 20th century.

Economist David M. Kotz suggests that the implementation of austerity measures following the 2007–2008 financial crisis was an attempt to preserve the neoliberal capitalist model.

==Theoretical considerations==
In the 1930s during the Great Depression, anti-austerity arguments gained more prominence. John Maynard Keynes became a well known anti-austerity economist, arguing that &quot;The boom, not the slump, is the right time for austerity at the Treasury.&quot;

Contemporary Keynesian economists argue that budget deficits are appropriate when an economy is in recession, to reduce unemployment and help spur GDP growth. According to Paul Krugman, since a government is not like a household, reductions in government spending during economic downturns worsen the crisis.

Across an economy, one person&#x27;s spending is another person&#x27;s income. In other words, if everyone is trying to reduce their spending, the economy can be trapped in what economists call the paradox of thrift, worsening the recession as GDP falls. In the past this has been offset by encouraging consumerism to rely on debt, but after the 2008 crisis, this has looked like a less and less viable option for sustainable economics.

Krugman argues that, if the private sector is unable or unwilling to consume at a level that increases GDP and employment sufficiently, then the government should be spending more in order to offset the decline in private spending. Keynesian theory is proposed as being responsible for post-war boom years, before the 1970s, and when public sector investment was at its highest across Europe, partially encouraged by the Marshall Plan.

An important component of economic output is business investment, but there is no reason to expect it to stabilize at full utilization of the economy&#x27;s resources. High business profits do not necessarily lead to increased economic growth. (When businesses and banks have a disincentive to spend accumulated capital, such as cash repatriation taxes from profits in overseas tax havens and interest on excess reserves paid to banks, increased profits can lead to decreasing growth.)

Economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart wrote in April 2013, &quot;Austerity seldom works without structural reforms – for example, changes in taxes, regulations and labor market policies – and if poorly designed, can disproportionately hit the poor and middle class. Our consistent advice has been to avoid withdrawing fiscal stimulus too quickly, a position identical to that of most mainstream economists.&quot;

To help improve the U.S. economy, they (Rogoff and Reinhart) advocated reductions in mortgage principal for &#x27;underwater homes&#x27; – those whose negative equity (where the value of the asset is less than the mortgage principal) can lead to a stagnant housing market with no realistic opportunity to reduce private debts.

===Multiplier effects===
In October 2012, the IMF announced that its forecasts for countries that implemented austerity programs have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected and that countries that implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected.

The IMF reported that this was due to fiscal multipliers that were considerably larger than expected: for example, the IMF estimated that fiscal multipliers based on data from 28 countries ranged between 0.9 and 1.7. In other words, a 1% GDP fiscal consolidation (i.e., austerity) would reduce GDP between 0.9% and 1.7%, thus inflicting far more economic damage than the 0.5 previously estimated in IMF forecasts.

In many countries, little is known about the size of multipliers, as data availability limits the scope for empirical research.

For these countries, Nicoletta Batini, Luc Eyraud and Anke Weber propose a simple method—dubbed the &quot;bucket approach&quot;—to come up with reasonable multiplier estimates. The approach bunches countries into groups (or &quot;buckets&quot;) with similar multiplier values, based on their characteristics, and taking into account the effect of (some) temporary factors such as the state of the business cycle.

Different tax and spending choices of equal magnitude have different economic effects:

For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that the payroll tax (levied on all wage earners) has a higher multiplier (impact on GDP) than does the income tax (which is levied primarily on wealthier workers). In other words, raising the payroll tax by $1 as part of an austerity strategy would slow the economy more than would raising the income tax by $1, resulting in less net deficit reduction.

In theory, it would stimulate the economy and reduce the deficit if the payroll tax were lowered and the income tax raised in equal amounts.

===Crowding in or out===

The term &quot;crowding out&quot; refers to the extent to which an increase in the budget deficit offsets spending in the private sector. Economist Laura Tyson wrote in June 2012, &quot;By itself an increase in the deficit, either in the form of an increase in government spending or a reduction in taxes, causes an increase in demand&quot;. How this affects output, employment, and growth depends on what happens to interest rates:

When the economy is operating near capacity, government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit causes interest rates to rise and higher interest rates reduce or &quot;crowd out&quot; private investment, reducing growth. This theory explains why large and sustained government deficits take a toll on growth: they reduce capital formation. But this argument rests on how government deficits affect interest rates, and the relationship between government deficits and interest rates varies.

When there is considerable excess capacity, an increase in government borrowing to finance an increase in the deficit does not lead to higher interest rates and does not crowd out private investment. Instead, the higher demand resulting from the increase in the deficit bolsters employment and output directly. The resultant increase in income and economic activity in turn encourages, or &quot;crowds in&quot;, additional private spending.

Some argue that the &quot;crowding-in&quot; model is an appropriate solution for current economic conditions.

===Government budget balance as a sectoral component===
According to economist Martin Wolf, the U.S. and many Eurozone countries experienced rapid increases in their budget deficits in the wake of the 2008 crisis as a result of significant private-sector retrenchment and ongoing capital account surpluses.

Policy choices had little to do with these deficit increases. This makes austerity measures counterproductive. Wolf explained that government fiscal balance is one of three major financial sectoral balances in a country&#x27;s economy, along with the foreign financial sector (capital account) and the private financial sector.

By definition, the sum of the surpluses or deficits across these three sectors must be zero. In the U.S. and many Eurozone countries other than Germany, a foreign financial surplus exists because capital is imported (net) to fund the trade deficit. Further, there is a private-sector financial surplus because household savings exceed business investment.

By definition, a government budget deficit must exist so all three net to zero: for example, the U.S. government budget deficit in 2011 was approximately 10% of GDP (8.6% of GDP of which was federal), offsetting a foreign financial surplus of 4% of GDP and a private-sector surplus of 6% of GDP.

Wolf explained in July 2012 that the sudden shift in the private sector from deficit to surplus forced the U.S. government balance into deficit: &quot;The financial balance of the private sector shifted towards surplus by the almost unbelievable cumulative total of 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product between the third quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009, which was when the financial deficit of US government (federal and state) reached its peak. ... No fiscal policy changes explain the collapse into massive fiscal deficit between 2007 and 2009, because there was none of any importance. The collapse is explained by the massive shift of the private sector from financial deficit into surplus or, in other words, from boom to bust.&quot;

Wolf also wrote that several European economies face the same scenario and that a lack of deficit spending would likely have resulted in a depression. He argued that a private-sector depression (represented by the private- and foreign-sector surpluses) was being &quot;contained&quot; by government deficit spending.

Economist Paul Krugman also explained in December 2011 the causes of the sizable shift from private-sector deficit to surplus in the U.S.: &quot;This huge move into surplus reflects the end of the housing bubble, a sharp rise in household saving, and a slump in business investment due to lack of customers.&quot;

One reason why austerity can be counterproductive in a downturn is due to a significant private-sector financial surplus, in which consumer savings is not fully invested by businesses. In a healthy economy, private-sector savings placed into the banking system by consumers are borrowed and invested by companies. However, if consumers have increased their savings but companies are not investing the money, a surplus develops.

Business investment is one of the major components of GDP. For example, a U.S. private-sector financial deficit from 2004 to 2008 transitioned to a large surplus of savings over investment that exceeded $1 trillion by early 2009, and remained above $800 billion into September 2012. Part of this investment reduction was related to the housing market, a major component of investment. This surplus explains how even significant government deficit spending would not increase interest rates (because businesses still have access to ample savings if they choose to borrow and invest it, so interest rates are not bid upward) and how Federal Reserve action to increase the money supply does not result in inflation (because the economy is awash with savings with no place to go).

Economist Richard Koo described similar effects for several of the developed world economies in December 2011: &quot;Today private sectors in the U.S., the U.K., Spain, and Ireland (but not Greece) are undergoing massive deleveraging [paying down debt rather than spending] in spite of record low interest rates. This means these countries are all in serious balance sheet recessions. The private sectors in Japan and Germany are not borrowing, either. With borrowers disappearing and banks reluctant to lend, it is no wonder that, after nearly three years of record low interest rates and massive liquidity injections, industrial economies are still doing so poorly. Flow of funds data for the U.S. show a massive shift away from borrowing to savings by the private sector since the housing bubble burst in 2007. The shift for the private sector as a whole represents over 9 percent of U.S. GDP at a time of zero interest rates. Moreover, this increase in private sector savings exceeds the increase in government borrowings (5.8 percent of GDP), which suggests that the government is not doing enough to offset private sector deleveraging.&quot;

==Framing of the debate surrounding austerity==
Many scholars have argued that how the debate surrounding austerity is framed has a heavy impact on the view of austerity in the public eye, and how the public understands macroeconomics as a whole. Wren-Lewis, for example, coined the term &#x27;mediamacro&#x27;, which refers to &quot;the role of the media reproducing particularly corrosive forms of economic illiteracy—of which the idea that deficits are ipso facto &#x27;bad&#x27; is a strong example.&quot; This can go as far as ignoring economists altogether; however, it often manifests itself as a drive in which a minority of economists whose ideas about austerity have been thoroughly debunked being pushed to the front to justify public policy, such as in the case of Alberto Alesina (2009), whose pro-austerity works were &quot;thoroughly debunked by the likes of the economists, the IMF, and the Centre for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).&quot; Other anti-austerity economists, such as Seymour have argued that the debate must be reframed as a social and class movement, and its impact judged accordingly, since statecraft is viewed as the main goal.

Further, critics such as Major have highlighted how the OECD and associated international finance organisations have framed the debate to promote austerity, for example, the concept of &#x27;wage-push inflation&#x27; which ignores the role played by the profiteering of private companies, and seeks to blame inflation on wages being too high.

==Empirical considerations==
According to a 2020 study, austerity increases the risk of default in situations of severe fiscal stress, but reduces the risk of default in situations of low fiscal stress.

===Europe===


====Eurozone====
During the European debt crisis, many countries embarked on austerity programs, reducing their budget deficits relative to GDP from 2010 to 2011.

According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, Greece decreased its budget deficit from 10.4% of GDP in 2010 to 9.6% in 2011. Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, France, and Spain also decreased their budget deficits from 2010 to 2011 relative to GDP but the austerity policy of the Eurozone achieves not only the reduction of budget deficits. The goal of economic consolidation influences the future development of the European social model.

With the exception of Germany, each of these countries had public-debt-to-GDP ratios that increased from 2010 to 2011, as indicated in the chart at right. Greece&#x27;s public-debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 143% in 2010 to 165% in 2011 Indicating despite declining budget deficits GDP growth was not sufficient to support a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio for these countries during this period.

Eurostat reported that the overall debt-to-GDP ratio for the EA17 was 70.1% in 2008, 80.0% in 2009, 85.4% in 2010, 87.3% in 2011, and 90.6% in 2012.
Further, real GDP in the EA17 declined for six straight quarters from Q4 2011 to Q1 2013.

Unemployment is another variable considered in evaluating austerity measures. According to the &quot;CIA World Factbook&quot;, from 2010 to 2011, the unemployment rates in Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and the UK increased. France and Italy had no significant changes, while in Germany and Iceland the unemployment rate declined. Eurostat reported that Eurozone unemployment reached record levels in March 2013 at 12.1%, up from 11.6% in September 2012 and 10.3% in 2011. Unemployment varied significantly by country.

Economist Martin Wolf analyzed the relationship between cumulative GDP growth in 2008 to 2012 and total reduction in budget deficits due to austerity policies in several European countries during April 2012 (see chart at right). He concluded, &quot;In all, there is no evidence here that large fiscal contractions budget deficit reductions bring benefits to confidence and growth that offset the direct effects of the contractions. They bring exactly what one would expect: small contractions bring recessions and big contractions bring depressions.&quot;

Changes in budget balances (deficits or surpluses) explained approximately 53% of the change in GDP, according to the equation derived from the IMF data used in his analysis.

Similarly, economist Paul Krugman analyzed the relationship between GDP and reduction in budget deficits for several European countries in April 2012 and concluded that austerity was slowing growth. He wrote: &quot;this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit, even in the short run. No wonder, then, that the whole austerity enterprise is spiraling into disaster.&quot;

=====Greece=====

The Greek government-debt crisis brought a package of austerity measures, put forth by the EU and the IMF mostly in the context of the three successive bailouts the country endured from 2010 to 2018; it was met with great anger by the Greek public, leading to riots and social unrest. On 27 June 2011, trade union organizations began a 48-hour labour strike in advance of a parliamentary vote on the austerity package, the first such strike since 1974.

Massive demonstrations were organized throughout Greece, intended to pressure members of parliament into voting against the package. The second set of austerity measures was approved on 29 June 2011, with 155 out of 300 members of parliament voting in favor. However, one United Nations official warned that the second package of austerity measures in Greece could pose a violation of human rights.

Around 2011, the IMF started issuing guidance suggesting that austerity could be harmful when applied without regard to an economy&#x27;s underlying fundamentals.

In 2013, it published a detailed analysis concluding that &quot;if financial markets focus on the short-term behavior of the debt ratio, or if country authorities engage in repeated rounds of tightening in an effort to get the debt ratio to converge to the official target&quot;, austerity policies could slow or reverse economic growth and inhibit full employment. Keynesian economists and commentators such as Paul Krugman have suggested that this has in fact been occurring, with austerity yielding worse results in proportion to the extent to which it has been imposed.

Overall, Greece lost 25% of its GDP during the crisis. Although the government debt increased only 6% between 2009 and 2017 (from €300 bn to €318 bn) — thanks, in part, to the 2012 debt restructuring —, the critical debt-to-GDP ratio shot up from 127% to 179% mostly due to the severe GDP drop during the handling of the crisis. In all, the Greek economy suffered the longest recession of any advanced capitalist economy to date, overtaking the US Great Depression. As such, the crisis adversely affected the populace as the series of sudden reforms and austerity measures led to impoverishment and loss of income and property, as well as a small-scale humanitarian crisis. Unemployment shot up from 8% in 2008 to 27% in 2013 and remained at 22% in 2017. As a result of the crisis, Greek political system has been upended, social exclusion increased, and hundreds of thousands of well-educated Greeks left the country.

=====France=====
In April and May 2012, France held a presidential election in which the winner, François Hollande, had opposed austerity measures, promising to eliminate France&#x27;s budget deficit by 2017 by canceling recently enacted tax cuts and exemptions for the wealthy, raising the top tax bracket rate to 75% on incomes over one million euros, restoring the retirement age to 60 with a full pension for those who have worked 42 years, restoring 60,000 jobs recently cut from public education, regulating rent increases, and building additional public housing for the poor. In the legislative elections in June, Hollande&#x27;s Socialist Party won a supermajority capable of amending the French Constitution and enabling the immediate enactment of the promised reforms. Interest rates on French government bonds fell by 30% to record lows, fewer than 50 basis points above German government bond rates.

=====Latvia=====
Latvia&#x27;s economy returned to growth in 2011 and 2012, outpacing the 27 nations in the EU, while implementing significant austerity measures. Advocates of austerity argue that Latvia represents an empirical example of the benefits of austerity, while critics argue that austerity created unnecessary hardship with the output in 2013 still below the pre-crisis level. While Anders Åslund maintains that internal devaluation was not opposed by the Latvian public, Jokubas Salyga has recently chronicled widespread protests against austerity in the country.

According to the CIA World Fact Book, &quot;Latvia&#x27;s economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year during 2006–07, but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure amid the softening world economy. Triggered by the collapse of the second largest bank, GDP plunged 18% in 2009. The economy has not returned to pre-crisis levels despite strong growth, especially in the export sector in 2011–12. The IMF, EU, and other international donors provided substantial financial assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the currency&#x27;s peg to the euro in exchange for the government&#x27;s commitment to stringent austerity measures.

The IMF/EU program successfully concluded in December 2011. The government of Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis remained committed to fiscal prudence and reducing the fiscal deficit from 7.7% of GDP in 2010, to 2.7% of GDP in 2012.&quot; The CIA estimated that Latvia&#x27;s GDP declined by 0.3% in 2010, then grew by 5.5% in 2011 and 4.5% in 2012. Unemployment was 12.8% in 2011 and rose to 14.3% in 2012. Latvia&#x27;s currency, the Lati, fell from $0.47 per U.S. dollar in 2008 to $0.55 in 2012, a decline of 17%. Latvia entered the euro zone in 2014. Latvia&#x27;s trade deficit improved from over 20% of GDP in 2006 to 2007 to under 2% GDP by 2012.

Eighteen months after harsh austerity measures were enacted (including both spending cuts and tax increases), economic growth began to return, although unemployment remained above pre-crisis levels. Latvian exports have skyrocketed and both the trade deficit and budget deficit have decreased dramatically. More than one-third of government positions were eliminated, and the rest received sharp pay cuts. Exports increased after goods prices were reduced due to private business lowering wages in tandem with the government.

Paul Krugman wrote in January 2013 that Latvia had yet to regain its pre-crisis level of employment. He also wrote, &quot;So we&#x27;re looking at a Depression-level slump, and 5 years later only a partial bounceback; unemployment is down but still very high, and the decline has a lot to do with emigration. It&#x27;s not what you&#x27;d call a triumphant success story, any more than the partial US recovery from 1933 to 1936—which was actually considerably more impressive—represented a huge victory over the Depression. And it&#x27;s in no sense a refutation of Keynesianism, either. Even in Keynesian models, a small open economy can, in the long run, restore full employment through deflation and internal devaluation; the point, however, is that it involves many years of suffering&quot;.

Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis defended his policies in a television interview, stating that Krugman refused to admit his error in predicting that Latvia&#x27;s austerity policy would fail. Krugman had written a blog post in December 2008 entitled &quot;Why Latvia is the New Argentina&quot;, in which he argued for Latvia to devalue its currency as an alternative or in addition to austerity.

====United Kingdom====
=====Post war austerity=====

Following the Second World War the United Kingdom had huge debts, large commitments, and had sold many income producing assets. Rationing of food and other goods which had started in the war continued for some years.

=====21st century austerity programme=====
Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 a period of economic recession began in the UK. The austerity programme was initiated in 2010 by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government, despite some opposition from the academic community. In his June 2010 budget speech, the Chancellor George Osborne identified two goals. The first was that the structural current budget deficit would be eliminated to &quot;achieve cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of the rolling, five-year forecast period&quot;. The second was that national debt as a percentage of GDP would fall. The government intended to achieve both of its goals through substantial reductions in public expenditure. This was to be achieved by a combination of public spending reductions and tax increases. Economists Alberto Alesina, Carlo A. Favero and Francesco Giavazzi, writing in &quot;Finance &amp; Development&quot; in 2018, argued that deficit reduction policies based on spending cuts typically have almost no effect on output, and hence form a better route to achieving a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio than raising taxes. The authors commented that the UK government austerity programme had resulted in growth that was higher than the European average and that the UK&#x27;s economic performance had been much stronger than the International Monetary Fund had predicted. This claim was challenged most strongly by Mark Blyth, whose 2014 book on austerity claims that austerity not only fails to stimulate growth, but effectively passes that debt down to the working classes. As such, many academics such as Andrew Gamble view Austerity in Britain less as an economic necessity, and more as a tool of statecraft, driven by ideology and not economic requirements. A study published in &quot;The BMJ&quot; in November 2017 found the Conservative government austerity programme had been linked to approximately 120,000 deaths since 2010; however, this was disputed, for example on the grounds that it was an observational study which did not show cause and effect. More studies claim adverse effects of austerity on population health, which include an increase in the mortality rate among pensioners which has been linked to unprecedented reductions in income support, an increase in suicides and the prescription of antidepressants for patients with mental health issues, and an increase in violence, self-harm, and suicide in prisons.

===United States===

The United States&#x27; response to the 2008 economic crash was largely influenced by Wall Street and IMF interests, who favored fiscal retrenchment in the face of the economic crash. Evidence exists to suggest that Pete Peterson (and the Petersonites) have heavily influenced US policy on economic recovery since the Nixon era, and presented itself in 2008, despite austerity measures being &quot;wildly out of step with public opinion and reputable economic policy...[and showing] anti-Keynesian bias of supply-side economics and a political system skewed to favor Wall Street over Main Street&quot;. The nuance of the economic logic of Keynesianism is, however, difficult to put across to the American Public, and compares poorly to the simplistic message which blames government spending, which might explain Obama&#x27;s preferred position of a halfway point between economic stimulus followed by austerity, which led to him being criticized by economists such as Joseph Stiglitz. The US began sweeping austerity measures to services such as healthcare, human services, US grants, and federal jobs during the second presidency of Donald Trump.

==Controversy==


Austerity programs can be controversial. In the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) briefing paper &quot;The IMF and the Third World&quot;, the ODI addresses five major complaints against the IMF&#x27;s austerity conditions. Complaints include such measures being &quot;anti-developmental&quot;, &quot;self-defeating&quot;, and tending &quot;to have an adverse impact on the poorest segments of the population&quot;.

In many situations, austerity programs are implemented by countries that were previously under dictatorial regimes, leading to criticism that citizens are forced to repay the debts of their oppressors.

In 2009, 2010, and 2011, workers and students in Greece and other European countries demonstrated against cuts to pensions, public services, and education spending as a result of government austerity measures.

Following the announcement of plans to introduce austerity measures in Greece, massive demonstrations occurred throughout the country aimed at pressing parliamentarians to vote against the austerity package. In Athens alone, 19 arrests were made, while 46 civilians and 38 policemen had been injured by 29 June 2011. The third round of austerity was approved by the Greek parliament on 12 February 2012 and met strong opposition, especially in Athens and Thessaloniki, where police clashed with demonstrators.

Opponents argue that austerity measures depress economic growth and ultimately cause reduced tax revenues that outweigh the benefits of reduced public spending. Moreover, in countries with already anemic economic growth, austerity can engender deflation, which inflates existing debt. Such austerity packages can also cause the country to fall into a liquidity trap, causing credit markets to freeze up and unemployment to increase. Opponents point to cases in Ireland and Spain in which austerity measures instituted in response to financial crises in 2009 proved ineffective in combating public debt and placed those countries at risk of defaulting in late 2010.

In October 2012, the IMF announced that its forecasts for countries that implemented austerity programs have been consistently overoptimistic, suggesting that tax hikes and spending cuts have been doing more damage than expected and that countries that implemented fiscal stimulus, such as Germany and Austria, did better than expected. These data have been scrutinized by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, which found no significant trends when outliers like Germany and Greece were excluded. Determining the multipliers used in the research to achieve the results found by the IMF was also described as an &quot;exercise in futility&quot; by Professor Carlos Vegh of the University of Michigan. Moreover, Barry Eichengreen of the University of California, Berkeley and Kevin H. O&#x27;Rourke of Oxford University write that the IMF&#x27;s new estimate of the extent to which austerity restricts growth was much lower than historical data suggest.

On 3 February 2015, Joseph Stiglitz wrote: &quot;Austerity had failed repeatedly from its early use under US president Herbert Hoover, which turned the stock-market crash into the Great Depression, to the IMF programs imposed on East Asia and Latin America in recent decades. And yet when Greece got into trouble, it was tried again.&quot; Government spending actually rose significantly under Hoover, while revenues were flat.

According to a 2020 study, which used survey experiments in the UK, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Germany, voters strongly disapprove of austerity measures, in particular spending cuts. Voters disapprove of fiscal deficits but not as strongly as austerity. A 2021 study found that incumbent European governments that implemented austerity measures in the Great Recession lost support in opinion polls.

Austerity has been blamed for at least 120,000 deaths between 2010 and 2017 in the UK, with one study putting it at 130,000 and another at 30,000 in 2015 alone. The first study added that &quot;no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect, but the findings back up other research in the field&quot; and campaigners have claimed that cuts to benefits, healthcare and mental health services lead to more deaths including through suicide.

==Balancing stimulus and austerity==
Strategies that involve short-term stimulus with longer-term austerity are not mutually exclusive. Steps can be taken in the present that will reduce future spending, such as &quot;bending the curve&quot; on pensions by reducing cost of living adjustments or raising the retirement age for younger members of the population, while at the same time creating short-term spending or tax cut programs to stimulate the economy to create jobs.

IMF managing director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011, &quot;For the advanced economies, there is an unmistakable need to restore fiscal sustainability through credible consolidation plans. At the same time we know that slamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth. That may sound contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling the issues that will bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space in the near term for policies that support growth.&quot;

Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke wrote in September 2011, &quot;the two goals—achieving fiscal sustainability, which is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term, and avoiding creation of fiscal headwinds for the recovery—are not incompatible. Acting now to put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the long term, while being attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help serve both objectives.&quot;

==&quot;Age of austerity&quot;==

The term &quot;age of austerity&quot; was popularised by UK Conservative Party leader David Cameron in his keynote speech to the Conservative Party forum in Cheltenham on 26 April 2009, in which he committed to end years of what he called &quot;excessive government spending&quot;. Theresa May claimed that &quot;Austerity is over&quot; as of 3 October 2018, a statement which was almost immediately met with criticism on the reality of its central claim, particularly in relation to the high possibility of a substantial economic downturn due to Brexit.

==Word of the year==
&quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; named the word &quot;austerity&quot; as its &quot;Word of the year&quot; for 2010 because of the number of web searches this word generated that year. According to the president and publisher of the dictionary, &quot;&quot;austerity&quot; had more than 250,000 searches on the dictionary&#x27;s free online [website] tool&quot; and the spike in searches &quot;came with more coverage of the debt crisis&quot;.

==Criticism==
According to economist David Stuckler and physician Sanjay Basu in their study &quot;The Body Economic: Why Austerity Kills&quot;, a health crisis is being triggered by austerity policies, including up to 10,000 additional suicides that have occurred across Europe and the U.S. since the introduction of austerity programs.

Much of the acceptance of austerity in the general public has centred on the way debate has been framed, and relates to an issue with representative democracy; since the public do not have widely available access to the latest economic research, which is highly critical of economic retrenchment in times of crisis, the public must rely on which politician sounds most plausible. 

An analysis by Hübscher et al. of 166 elections across Europe since 1980 demonstrates that austerity measures lead to increased electoral abstention and a rise in votes for non-mainstream parties, thereby exacerbating political polarization. Their detailed examination of specific austerity episodes reveals that new, small, and radical parties are the primary beneficiaries of such policies.

A study by Gabriel et al., analyzing elections in 124 European regions from eight countries between 1980 and 2015, found that fiscal consolidations increased the vote share of extreme parties, lowered voter turnout, and heightened political fragmentation. Notably, after the European debt crisis, a 1% reduction in regional public spending resulted in an approximate 3 percentage point rise in the vote share of extreme parties. The findings suggest that austerity measures diminish trust in political institutions and encourage support for more extreme political positions.

According to a 2020 study, austerity does not pay off in terms of reducing the default premium in situations of severe fiscal stress. Rather, austerity increases the default premium. However, in situations of low fiscal stress, austerity does reduce the default premium. The study also found that increases in government consumption had no substantial impact on the default premium.

Clara E. Mattei, assistant professor of economics at the New School for Social Research, posits that austerity is less of a means to &quot;fix the economy&quot; and is more of an ideological weapon of class oppression wielded by economic and political elites in order to suppress revolts and unrest by the working class public and close off any alternatives to the capitalist system. She traces the origins of modern austerity to post-World War I Britain and Italy, when it served as a &quot;powerful counteroffensive&quot; to rising working class agitation and anti-capitalist sentiment. In this, she quotes British economist G. D. H. Cole writing on the British response to the economic downturn of 1921:

&quot;The big working-class offensive had been successfully stalled off; and British capitalism, though threatened with economic adversity, felt itself once more safely in the saddle and well able to cope, both industrially and politically, with any attempt that might still be made from the labour side to unseat it.&quot;

===DeLong–Summers condition===
J. Bradford DeLong and Lawrence Summers explained why an expansionary fiscal policy is effective in reducing a government&#x27;s future debt burden, pointing out that the policy has a positive impact on its future productivity level. They pointed out that when an economy is depressed and its nominal interest rate is near zero, the real interest rate charged to firms formula_1 is linked to the output as formula_2. This means that the rate decreases as the real GDP increases, and the actual fiscal multiplier formula_3 is higher than that in normal times; a fiscal stimulus is more effective for the case where the interest rates are at the zero bound. As the economy is boosted by government spending, the increased output yields higher tax revenue, and so we have
:formula_4
where formula_5 is a baseline marginal tax-and-transfer rate. Also, we need to take account of the economy&#x27;s long-run growth rate formula_6, as a steady economic growth rate may reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio. Then we can see that an expansionary fiscal policy is self-financing:
:formula_7
:formula_8
as long as formula_9 is less than zero. Then we can find that a fiscal stimulus makes the long-term budget in surplus if the real government borrowing rate satisfies the following condition:
:formula_10

===Impacts on short-run budget deficit===
Research by Gauti Eggertsson et al. indicates that a government&#x27;s fiscal austerity measures actually increase its short-term budget deficit if the nominal interest rate is very low. In normal time, the government sets the tax rates formula_11 and the central bank controls the nominal interest rate formula_12. If the rate is so low that monetary policies cannot mitigate the negative impact of the austerity measures, the significant decrease of tax base makes the revenue of the government and the budget position worse. If the multiplier is
:formula_13
then we have formula_14, where
:formula_15 
That is, the austerity measures are counterproductive in the short-run, as long as the multiplier is larger than a certain level formula_16. This erosion of the tax base is the effect of the endogenous component of the deficit. Therefore, if the government increases sales taxes, then it reduces the tax base due to its negative effect on the demand, and it upsets the budget balance.

===No credit risk===
For a country that has its own currency, its government can create credits by itself, and its central bank can keep the interest rate close to or equal to the nominal risk-free rate. Former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan says that the probability that the US defaults on its debt repayment is zero, because the US government can print money. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis says that the US government&#x27;s debt is denominated in US dollars; therefore the government will never go bankrupt, though it may introduce the risk of inflation.

==Alternatives to austerity==

A number of alternative plans have been used and proposed as an alternative to implementing austerity measures, examples include:

* Infrastructure-based development
* New Deal (a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939 in response to the Great Depression in the United States).
Alternatives to implementing austerity measures may utilise increased government borrowing in the short-term (such as for use in infrastructure development and public work projects) to attempt to achieve long-term economic growth. Alternately, instead of government borrowing, governments can raise taxes to fund public sector activity.

<text>Alza Corporation was an American pharmaceutical and medical systems company.

==Background==
Founded in 1968 by Dr. Alejandro Zaffaroni; the company&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of his name. Alza was a major pioneer in the field of drug delivery systems, bringing over 20 prescription pharmaceutical products to market, and employing about 10,000 people during 20 years. In 2001, Alza was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson via a stock-for-stock transaction worth US$10.5 billion.

== Drug delivery platforms ==
The company owns the patents on the following delivery platforms:
* Alzamer Depot
* D-Trans
* DUROS implant
* E-Trans electrotransport
* OROS (Osmotic Release Oral System)
* Macroflux transdermal system
* Stealth liposomal

== Marketed Alza products ==
== Locations ==
Alza built its first corporate headquarters in 1971, at 950 Page Mill Road in Palo Alto, California. In 1990, Alza moved its headquarters to Shoreline Business Park, where it remained until late 2007, a few years after Alza was acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The remaining employees were relocated to two buildings elsewhere in the Shoreline Business Park.

Alza operated a large-scale manufacturing facility in Vacaville, California, but it was announced that this facility would shut down by 2022. They also previously operated a large-scale facility in Cashel, Ireland.

Google&#x27;s Googleplex is located just east of Alza Plaza. In August–September 2008, Google moved into the Alza plaza buildings.

<doc id="684046" wikidata="Q2629908" url="?curid=684046" title="Guilty Gear X">
<text>subtitled &quot;By Your Side&quot; in Japan, is a fighting game developed by Arc System Works and published by Sammy Studios. The second installment of the &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; series, &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; was developed over a period of about two years after the first game&#x27;s success. It was released in July 2000 for Japanese arcades, re-released on Dreamcast in December 2000, and later ported to PlayStation 2 in November 2001 and Game Boy Advance in January 2002.

&quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; continues its predecessor&#x27;s timeline with new characters and gameplay features. A four-button game, its instant-kill techniques were weakened and a survival mode was added to the previous game&#x27;s three modes. The Dreamcast and PS2 versions have sold over 100,000 copies in Japan; they have been praised for their graphics, controls and characters but criticized for their lack of replay value. The GBA version was the poorest-received, with the main complaints concerning ease and graphics.

== Gameplay ==
The fight system has a four-main-attack-button configuration: punch, kick, slash and heavy slash. Players may also launch taunt attacks, with their main objective to reduce the opponent&#x27;s health to zero in a predetermined time. To win a fight a player must accumulate two points, with each round won earning a point. &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; has features common in fighting games: combos, aerial attacks and counterattacks. A new feature is the Roman Cancel, which allows a player to cancel their move and its aftereffects to make other attacks.

The game has a tension gauge, increasing when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is stopped for a long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called Overdrive Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge for the remainder of that round.

&quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; Dreamcast version includes four modes of play: Arcade, the game&#x27;s primary narrative mode; Survival, in which the player fights through infinite levels until they are defeated; Training, which allows a player to practice moves with the help of an in-game move list and Versus, in which a player can fight another player. &quot;Guilty Gear X Plus&quot; also has art-gallery and story modes; according to the Sega website, the latter explains &quot;misteries&quot; which the Dreamcast version does not. The &quot;Advance Edition&quot; includes tag-team and three-on-three modes; each player chooses two or three characters, respectively, and can switch characters during a fight.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
In the year of 2181 (22nd century), less than a year after the events of &quot;Guilty Gear&quot;, reports of a newly discovered commander Gear surfaced. Amid concern about a second war, another Holy Knights Tournament begins; whoever captures and kills Dizzy will receive 500,000 World Dollars. She is defeated, but her life is spared by Sol Badguy, as she proves to be inoffensive. Shortly after, she is found by Ky Kiske, the police chief of the United Nations and ex-chief of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. He entrusts her care to Johnny and May, members of the Jellyfish Air Pirates, who welcome her as one of their own. Jam Kuradoberi, a bounty hunter and struggling chef, claims the credit for Dizzy&#x27;s disappearance so she can collect the reward and finance her restaurant.

===Characters===
&quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; has sixteen playable characters: Sol Badguy, Ky Kiske, May, Baiken, Faust, Potemkin, Chipp Zanuff, Millia Rage, Zato-1, Jam Kuradoberi, Johnny, Anji Mito, Venom, Axl Low, Testament and Dizzy. Fourteen are available from the outset, with Testament and Dizzy unlockable characters. &quot;Guilty Gear X Plus&quot; adds three unlockable characters: Justice and Kliff Undersn, who returns from the first game, and Robo-Ky, an alternate version of Ky Kiske. The &quot;Plus&quot; edition allows a player to unlock gold versions of each character, who possesses a special advantage over the regular version.

==Development and release==
After the success of the first &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; released on May 14, 1998 for PlayStation, Sammy Studios commissioned an arcade sequel in February 1999. Developed by Team Neo Blood, an Arc System Works production group led by Daisuke Ishiwatari, the sequel was about two years in development. Unveiled at the Amusement Expo in February 2000, &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; was released to Japanese arcades on the Sega NAOMI system in July 2000. After the game&#x27;s release, it was speculated that it would be ported to home consoles. Although the developers initially indicated that &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; would debut for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), it was first released for Dreamcast on December 14, 2000 and re-released as part of a Dreamcast collection on May 23, 2003.

A PS2 version was announced by Sammy in June 2001 for release that fall, and &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; was released in North America on October 2, 2001. Since it was released before the Japanese version, the North American edition did not have the additional features of the Japanese counterpart. Sammy released the PS2 version in Japan on November 29, 2001 and in Europe on March 1, 2002. In Japan, it was known as and was released in two versions: regular and deluxe, with the latter containing &quot;Guilty Gear&quot;-related special products. On February 13, 2003, the game was re-released in Japan as part of &quot;PlayStation2 the Best&quot;.

CyberFront released a PC version for Windows 9x on November 30, 2001 in Japan. Announced during an August 2001 convention at Space World, Game Boy Advance version was released on January 5, 2002. It was released in North America on August 13, 2002 and in Europe on September 27. &quot;Guilty Gear X ver. 1.5&quot;, an Atomiswave arcade-system version, was released only outside of Japan in 2003 after its February 2003 introduction at the Amusement Expo. In 2020, a homebrew conversion of &quot;Guilty Gear X ver. 1.5&quot; was released for the Dreamcast.

==Reception==
In June 2001, Sammy reported a profit of ¥284 million for &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s Japanese arcade version. In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the game on their September 1, 2000 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the month. Its Dreamcast version was the 128th-bestselling title in Japan in 2000, with 97,934 copies sold from December 14 to December 31. In 2001 the game sold 33,822 more copies, for a total of 131,756. &quot;Guilty Gear X Plus&quot; sold over 128,000 copies in Japan.

Critical reception for &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; on PS2 was positive, and has an average score of 80% on GameRankings, and Metacritic gave the PS2 version 79 out of 100. Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;X marks the spot for brutality done beautifully.&quot; Anoop Gantayat of IGN called the Dreamcast edition &quot;possibly the finest-looking 2D game ever, thanks to the high-res graphics, mega-ultra special effects and smooth animation.&quot; According to T.J. Deci of AllGame, the PS2 release is &quot;notable for smooth, refined graphics, with richly detailed characters and backgrounds uncommon in 2D fighters.&quot; Although &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s overall graphics were praised, its sometimes-confusing backgrounds were heavily criticized.

The Dreamcast version&#x27;s control responsiveness was praised by Gantayat. &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s PS2 version was also generally praised, with Greg Kasavin of GameSpot writing that it &quot;controls smoothly and precisely&quot;. Major Mike of &quot;GamePro&quot; included the caveat that &quot;some moves are difficult to execute and require patience to master fully.&quot; According to James Fudge for GameSpy, &quot;The gameplay manages to be easy to pick up but isn&#x27;t dumbed down enough to annoy expert fight fans.&quot; &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s limited replay value was heavily criticised; Jay Fitzloff of &quot;Game Informer&quot; said, &quot;Since it&#x27;s especially weak in the singles game, consider purchasing &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot; only if you and a friend want to go at it.&quot; The game was a runner-up for &quot;Outstanding Fighting Game Sequel&quot; by the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers, losing to &quot;Dead or Alive 3&quot;. The PlayStation 2 version was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; award among console games, losing to &quot;&quot;.

The Game Boy Advance version was less well received, with aggregate scores of 64.97 percent and 67 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. A common criticism was that the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence was inefficient in combat, making it too easy. Although Chet of &quot;Game Informer&quot; said, &quot;The new modes such as Tag Match and 3-on-3 add variety, but still cannot compensate for this fundamental problem&quot;, according to Michael Knutson of GameZone its balance &quot;gives the game a better replay value.&quot; Its visual were very criticized; GamesRadar panned &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s &quot;overblown aesthetics&quot;, giving it the game&#x27;s worst score (three out of ten): &quot;While it&#x27;s not completely hellish, it definitely deserves purgatory.&quot; According to Star Dingo of &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;Most backgrounds seem like pale, watercolor imitations of the originals (you can count the colors on two hands)&quot;. Justin of &quot;Game Informer&quot; and Kaiser Hwang of IGN criticized the game&#x27;s sprites, which they considered small compared with those of &quot;Street Fighter&quot;.

Its characters were praised as &quot;original&quot; by Justin and &quot;cool&quot; by Kasavin. Gantayat wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s the characters that stand out the most&quot;, calling them &quot;marvelously designed,&quot; &quot;unmatched in terms of fine details&quot; and &quot;very distinct.&quot; According to Fudge, &quot;There&#x27;s a character of choice for just about everyone.&quot; The characters&#x27; balance was praised by Tom Bramwell and Knutson. &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s audio had a lukewarm response; according to Chet and Hwang it was &quot;weak&quot;, and Dingo called it &quot;atrocious&quot;. Mike and Kasavin found the fight announcer&#x27;s voice &quot;unintelligible&quot;, with Mike also criticizing the game&#x27;s &quot;oppressive&quot; music. Knutson praised &quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s sound effects and music, and Kasavin considered its music appropriate for &quot;the game&#x27;s fast-paced action, as well as its anime theme.&quot;

==Other media==

===Music===
&quot;Guilty Gear X&quot;″s musical albums were published by First Smile Entertainment. Its arcade music was released on September 20, 2000 as , composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari and arranged by Kazuhito Tomizuka and Yasuharu Takanashi. The album received mixed reviews. Don Kotowski of Square Enix Music Online gave it an eight out of ten: &quot;The improved sound quality is a plus, as are the addition of new character themes, but some people may be put off by the fact that some of the new themes aren&#x27;t as good as some of the older ones.&quot; Another reviewer, GoldfishX, gave it a five, calling it &quot;possibly the most ear-grating, hideous sound I have ever encountered in game music&quot; but not giving it a worse score because &quot;Ishiwatari deserves a ton of credit for putting together such brilliant compositions on such pathetic-sounding hardware.&quot;

A second album, &quot;Guilty Gear X Heavy Rock Tracks: The Original Soundtrack of Dreamcast&quot;, composed by Ishiwatari and arranged by Koichi Seiyama, was released on January 17, 2001. It was well received by critics, with perfect scores from GoldfishX and Z-Freak of Square Enix Music Online. According to Goldfishx, &quot;Even if you&#x27;re skeptical about hard rock, this is something that everyone should experience in their lifetime. It&#x27;s rare to have this type of heart-pounding sound without some form of vocals, but it&#x27;s even rarer that the compositions reach this overall level of greatness.&quot; Z-Freak wrote, &quot;Unless you totally hate hard rock, you have this CD&quot; and David Smith of IGN said that its music would either be loved or hated.

Three albums by the rock band Lapis Lazuli were released on May 6, 2001. Known collectively as &quot;Rising Force of Gear Image Vocal Tracks&quot;, the individual albums were entitled &quot;Rock You!!&quot;, &quot;Slash!!&quot;, and &quot;Destroy!!&quot;

<doc id="684047" wikidata="Q471067" url="?curid=684047" title="Jean-Luc Ponty">
<text>Jean-Luc Ponty (born 29 September 1942) is a French jazz and jazz fusion violinist and composer. He is considered a pioneer of jazz-rock, particularly for his use of the electric violin starting in the 1970s. He rose to prominence for his collaborations with popular musical artists Frank Zappa and Elton John. In addition to his solo work, he has performed with symphony orchestras in France, the United States, Canada, and Japan.

== Early life==
Ponty was born into a family of classical musicians in Avranches, France. His father taught violin, his mother taught piano. At sixteen, he was admitted to the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique de Paris, graduating two years later with the institution&#x27;s highest honor, Premier Prix (first prize). He was hired by the Orchestre Lamoureux in which he played for three years.

While still a member of the orchestra in Paris, Ponty picked up a side job playing clarinet (which his father had taught him) for a college jazz band that regularly performed at local parties. It proved life-changing. A growing interest in Miles Davis and John Coltrane compelled him to take up tenor saxophone. One night after an orchestra concert, and still wearing his tuxedo, Ponty found himself at a local club with only his violin. Within four years, he was widely accepted as the leading figure in &quot;jazz fiddle&quot;.

At that time, Ponty was leading a dual musical life: rehearsing and performing with the orchestra while also playing jazz at clubs throughout Paris. The demands of this schedule eventually brought him to a crossroads. Critic Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that &quot;Since Ponty, the jazz violin has been a different instrument&quot;.

== Success with the violin ==
At first, the violin proved to be challenging; few at the time viewed the instrument as having a legitimate place in the modern jazz vocabulary. With a powerful sound that eschewed vibrato, Ponty distinguished himself with bebop phrasing and a punchy style influenced more by horn players than by anything previously tried on the violin. In 1964, at age 22, he released his debut album, &quot;Jazz Long Playing&quot;. He performed on stage in Basel, Switzerland, with string players Stuff Smith, Stéphane Grappelli, and Svend Asmussen. The performance was released as the album &quot;Violin Summit&quot; (1966).

John Lewis of the Modern Jazz Quartet invited Ponty to perform at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1967, which led to a recording contract with the World Pacific label and the albums &quot;Electric Connection&quot; (1969) with the Gerald Wilson Big Band and &quot;Jean-Luc Ponty Experience with the George Duke Trio&quot; (1969). That year also brought &quot;Sunday Walk&quot; (1967), the first collaboration between Ponty and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen.

== Frank Zappa and emigration to the United States==

In 1969, Frank Zappa composed the music for Ponty&#x27;s solo album &quot;King Kong: Jean-Luc Ponty Plays the Music of Frank Zappa&quot; (World Pacific, 1970). In 1972, Elton John invited Ponty to contribute to his &quot;Honky Chateau&quot; (1972) album. At the urging of Zappa and The Mothers of Invention, who wanted him to join their tour, Ponty emigrated with his wife and two young daughters to the United States and made his home in Los Angeles. He continued to work on a variety of projects – including two of John McLaughlin&#x27;s Mahavishnu Orchestra albums &quot;Apocalypse&quot; (1974) and &quot;Visions of the Emerald Beyond&quot; (1975) and tours until 1975, when he signed with Atlantic.

For the next decade, Ponty toured the world repeatedly and recorded 12 consecutive albums, each of which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz charts top five, selling millions of albums. His early Atlantic recordings, such as 1976&#x27;s &quot;Aurora&quot; and &quot;Imaginary Voyage&quot;, established Ponty as one of the leading figures in jazz-rock. He went on to crack the Top 40 with the album &quot;Enigmatic Ocean&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Cosmic Messenger&quot; in 1978. In 1984, a video of time-lapse images of New York City and Chicago was produced by Louis Schwarzberg for the song &quot;Individual Choice&quot; (1983).

Besides recording and touring with his own group, Ponty performed with the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble, the Radio City Orchestra in New York, and symphony orchestras in Montreal, Toronto, Oklahoma City, and Tokyo. In the late 1980s he recorded the albums &quot;The Gift of Time&quot; (1987) and &quot;Storytelling&quot; (1989) for Columbia.

On &quot;Tchokola&quot; (Epic, 1991) Ponty combined acoustic and electric violins for the first time with polyrhythmic sounds of West Africa. He performed for two months in the U.S. and Canada with African expatriates he had met in Paris. In 1993, he returned to Atlantic with the album &quot;No Absolute Time&quot;. In 1995, he joined guitarist Al Di Meola and bassist Stanley Clarke to record an acoustic album, &quot;The Rite of Strings&quot;. This trio undertook a six-month tour of North America, South America, and Europe. He reunited his American band in 1996 for live performances following the release of a double album for Atlantic titled &quot;Le Voyage: The Jean-Luc Ponty Anthology&quot;. One of these concerts was recorded in Detroit, Michigan on June 29, 1996, and released in October 1996 by Atlantic under the title &quot;Live at Chene Park&quot;.

In 1997, Ponty reunited his group of Western and African musicians to pursue the fusion music he had begun to explore in 1991. They toured for three years from the Hawaiian Islands to Poland and in North America and Europe. Ponty performed a duet with bassist Miroslav Vitous in December 1999. In January 2000, he participated in Lalo Schifrin&#x27;s recording &quot;Esperanto&quot;. In June 2001 he performed duets with Russian violinist Vadim Repin and at the Film Music Festival in Poland with American jazz violinist Regina Carter.

In August 2001, Ponty released his album &quot;Life Enigma&quot; on his label (J.L.P. Productions), a return to his concept from the 1970s with modern production. He played all the instruments on some tracks and was joined by band members for others. He gave a concert with his band in his native town of Avranches in Normandy on 21 September 2001. He was honored during a ceremony at City Hall. He then embarked on a tour in the U.S. in October and November 2001. In May 2001, he recorded a concert with the same musicians at the opera house in Dresden, Germany. This recording was released in July 2002 on &quot;Live at Semper Opera&quot;. In January 2003, he toured India for the first time, seven shows in six major cities for the Global Music Festival organized by Indian violinist L. Subramaniam. 

Ponty performed on a reunion tour with Stanley Clarke and Al Di Meola from June to October 2004 in the U.S. and Canada. In 2005, he toured with Trio! with Stanley Clarke and Béla Fleck. In 2006, he reunited Jean-Luc Ponty &amp; His Band and toured in the U.S., Chile, Venezuela, Western and Eastern Europe, Russia, The Middle East and India; they recorded a studio album called &quot;The Atacama Experience&quot; (2007) with guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Philip Catherine. In April 2012, Ponty performed in an acoustic trio with Clarke and guitarist Bireli Lagrene for the second set of a concert at the Chatelet Theatre in Paris to celebrate five decades in music. The first set featured Ponty with a string orchestra. In 2014, he recorded a jazz album entitled &quot;D-Stringz&quot; with Clarke and Lagrene. In March of 2014, Jon Anderson, the lead singer of Yes announced he was forming a new band with Jean Luc Ponty as the result of a mutual friend, Michael Lewis. The project was originally called Inventioning. In July of 2014, the band was formally introduced as the Anderson-Ponty Band.

== Work with Return to Forever ==

In 2011, Ponty was invited by bandleader/keyboardist Chick Corea to join the group Return to Forever for a series of concerts throughout that year. The group was labeled &#x27;Return to Forever IV&#x27;, as it is the fourth incarnation of the group. Ponty had first recorded with Corea on his 1976 solo album &quot;My Spanish Heart&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ponty is married and has two daughters. One daughter, Clara Ponty, is a pianist and composer; Ponty has collaborated with Clara on several projects, including her third album, &quot;Mirror of Truth&quot; (2004).

<doc id="684051" wikidata="Q2630217" url="?curid=684051" title="Guilty Gear Isuka">
<text>is a 2D fighting video game developed by Arc System Works and published by Sammy Corporation. Announced by Arc in September, it was released on December 17, 2003, in arcades as the sixth installment of the &quot;Guilty Gear&quot; series. Later, the game was ported for a release on the PlayStation 2 (PS2), Xbox, and Windows in Japan. The PS2 version was brought to North America by Sammy, and, in Europe, the home console version was released by 505 Game Street and the PC version by Zoo Digital Publishing.

While the gameplay remained almost the same as in previous titles, the game introduced a four-player battle mode, and the PS2 and Xbox version included new features to the series, including a scrolling adventure, a customization mode, and two new characters. &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; received mixed critical reviews. It was praised for its visual, music and customization features. However, although some aspects of the new gameplay—such as the two fighting planes and the turn button—were praised as original, their implementation was criticized. The removal of features present in previous titles was also not well received by critics.

==Gameplay==

===Combat system===
The basic gameplay system of &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; is like the other games in the series. The game uses a four attack button configuration that consists of punch, kick, slash, and high slash. Unlike previous games, it features a &quot;turn&quot; button, since a character does not automatically turn around if its opponent moves to the other side of the screen. Each character (or team) starts a fight with at least a &quot;soul&quot;; when a character life bar is emptied, its life is filled while the player lost a soul. If the life is depleted when the player has no souls, it is defeated. It also features previous installments features like the tension gauge, which allows the player to perform super moves, and the burst gauge, which allows the player to break combinations and super moves.

=== Modes ===

The game introduces a four-player option in Versus Mode, giving a player four characters who can fight two-on-two, three-on-one or everyone-for-themselves. There are two fighting planes, one in the foreground and the other behind it.

Another innovation was Boost Mode: a two-player, side-scrolling, arcade-style beat &#x27;em up mode not included in the arcade version, in which a player fights enemy waves to accumulate items, health and experience. For the Xbox, this mode was adapted for online play with Xbox Live, supporting up to 16 players. Experience points from Boost Mode can be used in the new Robo-Ky II Factory mode, in which a player can customize a robot named Robo-Ky II by teaching him moves, combos, or one of 65 special attacks from other characters. In addition to the attacks, other aspects such as jump height, offense, defense, recovery time, tension, and speed can be improved.

The game also features other modes: Color Edit, a palette swap editor that allows the player to customize nearly every aspect of the characters, including buckles and hair; Training, in which a player can practice with (and against) computer-controlled opponents and Arcade, similar to the survival mode featured in other fighting games.

===Playable characters===

&quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; features twenty playable characters in its arcade version: Anji Mito, Axl Low, Baiken, Bridget, Chipp Zanuff, Dizzy, Eddie, Faust, I-No, Jam Kuradoberi, Johnny, Ky Kiske, May, Millia Rage, Potemkin, Slayer, Sol Badguy, Testament, Venom, and Zappa. Three characters were added to the PlayStation 2 edition: A.B.A, Robo-Ky, and Robo-Ky II.

==Development and release==
In September 2003, Sammy Corporation announced that a new game dubbed &quot;Guilty Gear X Series The Newest Version&quot; would be featured at the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association (JAMMA) arcade show; at the show, the company revealed that &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; would be the game&#x27;s name. &quot;In &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; we want to satisfy existing fighter fans with new content and never-before-seen innovations. We also want to reach out to mainstream fans to show them that, right now, the envelope in fighting games is also being pushed in two dimensions&quot;, declared Tim Pivnicny, senior VP of Sammy Studios, Inc. A PlayStation 2 version of the game was announced to be in development on March 3, 2004. An August 24 announcement said that the game would be compatible with Xbox.

&quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; was released in Japan on December 17, 2003, by Sammy for the Atomiswave arcade cabinets, followed by the PlayStation 2 version on July 29, 2004. An Xbox version was released by Arc System Works on December 16, 2004, and Sourcenext released the game for Windows on November 25, 2005. In North America, &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; was released by Sammy for PlayStation 2 on November 2, 2004. In Europe, 505 Games Street released it on June 16, 2005, for PlayStation 2, and the PC version was released on April 7, 2006, by Zoo Digital Publishing (now Zushi Games). In 2007, the game was made compatible with Xbox 360. DotEmu also released &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; on its DRM-free shop in April 2011. On January 16, 2014, the game was released on the Steam digital distribution platform for Windows PCs. In 2020, a homebrew conversion was released for the Dreamcast.

==Reception==
&quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; was the 176th-bestselling Japanese title in 2004, with 74,270 copies sold for PlayStation 2 as of December 26. It was &quot;Best Fighting Game&quot; at the Best of E3 2004 Awards from IGN, and was nominated for &quot;Best Sequel Fighting&quot; at the 2004 National Academy of Video Game Testers and Reviewers (NAVGTR) Awards, which went to &quot;Dead or Alive Ultimate&quot;. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with a score of 76% at GameRankings and 73/100 at Metacritic. Allgame&#x27;s Damian Francis gave the game three-and-a-half stars out of five; &quot;Famitsu&quot;″s four reviewers scored it 7, 7, 6, and 7 (out of 10) respectively, with a total score of 27 out of 40.

Although the introduction of two planes and the turning button were considered good ideas in theory, both features were heavily criticized by reviewers. Jeremy Dunham of IGN, Manny LaMancha of &quot;GamePro&quot; and Benjamin Turner of GameSpy felt it difficult to fight one-on-one when a player can start a cat-and-mouse game, while GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin and Brian Gee of Game Revolution found the features to cause &quot;chaos&quot;. Turner said it deprived the player of the ability &quot;to have a normal &quot;Guilty Gear X2&quot;-style match&quot;, and Dunham said the computer reacted faster. David Smith of 1UP.com called it an &quot;irrational control scheme&quot;. The perceived poor execution of its new features led GameSpy to give it a special &quot;It Sounded Good on Paper&quot; award.

Conversely, other additions received more positive feedback. Dunham called the Boost and Factory modes &quot;intriguing distractions&quot;, while Turner praised the latter for &quot;much depth and nuance&quot;, unreached by other games. Kasavin said the Boost Mode gets boring quickly due to the lack of an objective; though Kasavin declared that the Factory Mode &quot;is quite possibly the most interesting part of the gameplay&quot;, he criticized how it depends on playing &quot;a mindless side-scroller over and over.&quot; The new backgrounds were commended by Dunham, Kasavin and Smith, with the latter saying that Sammy should have saved them for a better game.

The maintenance of aspects from previous titles, including its animation and soundtrack, was praised by Kasavin, Turner, and Gee. Its soundtrack was said to be &quot;the best score in the franchise so far&quot; by Dunham, and was rated among video game soundtracks which &quot;never got the recognition they truly deserve&quot; by Siliconera. LaMancha, however, criticized a lack of improvement of its animation and music compared to its gameplay. The removal of other features from previous titles was criticized: Dunham and Kasavin complained about the lack of a story mode, while Joe Juba of &quot;Game Informer&quot; said the series had a &quot;magic&quot; until &quot;Isuka&quot;, criticizing the new additions and the absence of a traditional arcade mode. &quot;Isuka&quot; was well-rated on balance, but considered inferior to the previous &quot;Guilty Gear X2 #Reload&quot;.

==Other media==

===Music===
, composed by Daisuke Ishiwatari, Tetsuya Ohuchi and Yoshihiro Kusano, arranged by Ohuchi and Kusano, was released on CD by Team Entertainment on April 21, 2004. An additional edition was released on iTunes on November 23, 2005; it contains six more tracks, totalizing 26 tracks.

It was well received by critics; Don Kotowski and Harry of Square Enix Music Online rated it 8 out of 10. Kotowski said Ishiwatari is the mainstream in the soundtrack, while Ohuchi and Kusano &quot;somewhat disappoint&quot;, qualifying it as &quot;a great album&quot; in overall. Harry said the only thing bad about this album is its &quot;too short&quot; length. Writing for the same site, a reviewer dubbed GoldfishX rated it 7 out of 10, citing &quot;it lacks the depth of previous entries in the series.&quot;

===Books===
Ichijinsha released two &quot;Guilty Gear Isuka&quot; manga adaptations under its &quot;DNA Media Comics&quot; line.

<text>Lisa Mary Moretti (born November 26, 1961) is an American retired professional wrestler, teacher and coach. She is best known for her tenure in WWE, where she is a three-time WWE Women&#x27;s Champion and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2018.

Moretti began her career and first found national exposure in the independent promotion Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, where she performed as Tina Ferrari from the mid-to-late-1980s. Moretti debuted in WWE in 1999 as the manager for D&#x27;Lo Brown &amp; Mark Henry. She won the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship twice, before becoming a part of the villainous Right to Censor, a storyline stable of characters with harshly conservative sociopolitical views. This led to her third Women&#x27;s Championship victory.

In her later years with WWE, she wrestled only sporadically. Moretti co-hosted &quot;WWE Experience&quot; and served as one of the trainers on &quot;WWE Tough Enough&quot;. After she left WWE in 2005, she wrestled for Women Superstars Uncensored, winning two other titles, and was also inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame. Moretti also began volunteering at her local animal shelter, and in 2007 opened an animal care and grooming facility named Downtown Dog in her hometown.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early years (1986–1994) ===
In her youth, Moretti wrestled with her two brothers and sister. Later, while attending the University of Southern California (USC), Moretti was, in her own words, &quot;dragged by a friend&quot; (later confirmed to be Nadine Kadmiri) to an audition held by the newly formed Las Vegas, Nevada-based Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). She and Kadmiri were both successful in their audition and went on to train under Mando Guerrero for six weeks, before beginning to wrestle in GLOW under the ring names Tina Ferrari and Ashley Cartier respectively, also forming a tag team known as T &amp; A. Ferrari defeated Colonel Ninotchka to win the vacant GLOW Championship, which was represented by a crown. She later wrestled for the Powerful Women of Wrestling promotion and the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association under the ring names Nina and Tina Moretti, winning the POWW Championship. On September 23, 1994, at UWF&#x27;s Blackjack Brawl, Moretti, under the name Tina Moretti, wrestled against Candi Devine for the vacant UWF World Women&#x27;s Championship in a losing effort. After UWF, Moretti took a hiatus from wrestling and was not seen in the public eye for five years.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1999-2005) ===
==== Women&#x27;s Champion (1999-2000) ====
In January 1999, after several years of absence, Moretti returned to wrestling, signing a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Her first appearance in WWF was accompanying The Godfather, a &quot;pimp&quot; character who was accompanied by various women dubbed the &quot;hos&quot;, to the ring. On the February 13, 1999 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, however, Moretti was introduced as Ivory, the storyline love interest of Mark Henry. Ivory acted as the fan favorite valet for the tag team of Mark Henry and D&#x27;Lo Brown, and made her televised WWF in-ring debut on the February 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, teaming with Brown to face Jeff Jarrett and Debra in an intergender tag team match that ended in a no contest. Ivory faced Debra in a singles match on the March 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Debra by disqualification after she was attacked by the Pretty Mean Sisters (Jacqueline Moore and Terri Runnels). At WrestleMania XV on March 28, Ivory accompanied D&#x27;Lo Brown and Test to the ring for their WWF Tag Team Championship title match against Jarrett and Owen Hart. Jarrett and Hart retained their titles following interference from Moore, Runnels, and Debra.

During this time, the women in the WWF were known more for their physical appearances and &quot;sex appeal&quot; rather than their wrestling abilities, and featuring women in strip matches or farcical &quot;slop matches&quot;, a match that takes place in a pool of slop, were common. Ivory, who was a trained wrestler, entered into a brief feud with Sable, the current title holder, who subsequently dropped the title to Debra. Ivory finally won the Women&#x27;s Championship on June 14, by defeating Debra and went on to defend her title against Tori at SummerSlam on August 22. Ivory turned heel during her feud with Tori, which continued in the weeks following SummerSlam, defeating Tori in the first ever WWF women&#x27;s hardcore match on September 6. Ivory was then challenged by Luna Vachon, who Ivory defeated in a farcical hardcore match at Unforgiven on September 26. SLAM! Wrestling called the match &quot;pointless and senseless&quot;. In October 1999, Ivory feuded with The Fabulous Moolah, who defeated her for the Women&#x27;s Championship on October 17, 1999, at No Mercy, in what John Powell of SLAM! Wrestling called the &quot;worst match I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. She, however, defeated Moolah in a rematch on the October 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to win her second Women&#x27;s Championship. Her second title reign ended with a loss to Miss Kitty, an un-trained wrestler, in a Four Corners Evening Gown pool match, a match where a wrestler wins by stripping the evening gown off of her opponents, on December 12 at Armageddon.

In late 1999, Ivory began portraying a more conservative character. On January 23, 2000, at the Royal Rumble, she grudgingly took part in the &quot;Miss Royal Rumble&quot; swimsuit contest, which was won by Mae Young. She challenged Jacqueline for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship on March 9, but she was unsuccessful. A few weeks later on an episode of Smackdown, she became the first woman to attempt to win the WWF Hardcore Championship, after unsuccessfully trying to pin Crash Holly backstage.

==== Right to Censor (2000–2001) ====

Following a period of absence, Ivory returned to WWF television in October 2000 as a member of a villainous alliance of conservative wrestlers known as Right to Censor. The change in character saw her don less suggestive ring attire and more conservative hairstyles. Ivory quickly began a rivalry with Women&#x27;s Champion Lita, winning the Women&#x27;s Championship for the third time by defeating Lita, Jacqueline, and Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four-Way match. She retained the title against Lita at the Survivor Series on November 19, with the assistance of Right to Censor leader Steven Richards, in a match that SLAM! Wrestling claimed &quot;illustrated to what heights women&#x27;s wrestling is capable of reaching in North America if the right talent is permitted to strut their stuff in a wrestling ring and not a pit full of jello.&quot; Ivory also retained her title in a Triple Threat match against Stratus and Molly Holly at Armageddon on December 10.

Ivory and the Right to Censor began feuding with Chyna after the latter posed for &quot;Playboy&quot; in late 2000. On the December 7 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Ivory and Val Venis delivered a double-team piledriver to Chyna which, in storyline, injured her neck. Chyna challenged Ivory for the Women&#x27;s Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 21, 2001. Ivory retained her title when she pinned Chyna, who had appeared to re-aggravate her neck injury. Chyna challenged Ivory for the title once more at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1 and defeated Ivory in a brief match, ending Ivory&#x27;s third reign as Women&#x27;s Champion. The Right to Censor stable was finally disbanded on April 26, 2001.

==== Various storylines (2001–2005) ====

Ivory returned to WWF television on the August 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, joining The Alliance during The Invasion, a storyline where the former wrestlers of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) formed an alliance and &quot;invaded&quot; the WWF. Ivory formed an alliance with former WCW wrestlers Torrie Wilson and Stacy Keibler after helping them defeat Jacqueline in a handicap match, but later turned on Wilson due to her budding romance with Tajiri. Ivory eventually became the valet for Lance Storm. At No Mercy, Ivory accompanied Storm and The Hurricane to the ring, but the Hardy Boyz defeated the two men to retain their WCW World Tag Team Championship. Ivory went on to compete in the women&#x27;s division, and on November 18 at the Survivor Series, she participated in a six-pack challenge for the vacant Women&#x27;s Championship, which Trish Stratus won.

In early 2002, Ivory served as a trainer in the second series of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;. After the World Wrestling Federation was renamed &quot;World Wrestling Entertainment&quot; and the roster was split into two &quot;brands&quot;, Raw and SmackDown!, Ivory was drafted to the SmackDown! brand. Continuing to portray a villainess, Ivory engaged in a brief feud with &quot;Tough Enough&quot; co-winners Linda Miles and Jackie Gayda, which led to her facing Miles on the June 8 episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;. Ivory won the match after Gayda shoved Miles off the top rope and costing her the match. On the June 13 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Ivory teamed with Gayda in a losing effort against Miles and Trish Stratus. Along with several other SmackDown! wrestlers, Ivory was traded to Raw in exchange for The Big Show in November 2002. Throughout the remainder of 2002, she teamed with Victoria in tag team matches and feuded with Trish Stratus. In November of that year, she was also part of the WWE Raw Tour in India, becoming the first female performer to tour the country, however only appeared in media events and signings, as she was not booked to compete.

In 2003, Ivory became a face and wrestled sporadically in the women&#x27;s division. In June of that year, she had three pinfall victories over the WWE Women&#x27;s Champion, Jazz, but never received a title match opportunity. Her only pay-per-view appearance in the course of the year was on December 14 at Armageddon, where she unsuccessfully challenged Molly Holly for the Women&#x27;s Championship, after Molly grabbed her tights for leverage, and managed to capture the victory. She also served as a trainer on the third season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, and did broadcasting duties at WWE events. Ivory also spent eight weeks working as a trainer at WWE&#x27;s then-developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) and also made one televised appearance against Jillian Hall in a losing effort. In May of that year, she and Todd Grisham began hosting &quot;The WWE Experience&quot;, a weekly television show that recapped events from &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. On July 22, 2005, several weeks before &quot;WWE Experience&quot; ended in August 2005, WWE announced that Ivory had opted not to renew her contract with the company.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2006) ===
After leaving WWE, Moretti began wrestling sporadically on the independent circuit under her birth name. On November 19, 2005, in Spartanburg, South Carolina at &quot;A Tribute to Starrcade&quot;, she teamed with Bambi to defeat Team Blondage (Krissy Vaine and Amber O&#x27;Neal) for the CCW Tag Team Championship. On April 21, 2006, in Surrey, British Columbia, Moretti defeated Rebecca Knox for Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling (ECCW)&#x27;s NWA SuperGirls Championship. She also successfully retained her title in a match the following night. Afterward, Moretti decided to stay with ECCW to help create a strong women&#x27;s division. She held the title for approximately five months before losing it to Nattie Neidhart on October 8, 2006.

On March 5, 2011, Moretti appeared at the Women Superstars Uncensored (WSU) 4 Year Anniversary event, where she was inducted into the WSU Hall of Fame. She also appeared on the event, preventing Rick Cataldo from interfering successfully in the WSU Spirit Championship bout, hitting Cataldo with the &quot;Poison Ivory&quot;, between Brittney Savage and Sassy Stephie. As a result, Stephie was able to win, capturing the championship and thanking Ivory for her help.

===WWE appearances and Hall of Fame (2015–2022)===

Ivory took part in the WrestleMania Axxess convention from WrestleMania 31 in March 2015 and later appeared on &quot;The WWE List&quot;, a digital series that aired on WWE.com. On January 27, 2016, she appeared on the WWE Network program &quot;Table for 3&quot;, alongside fellow wrestlers Alundra Blayze and Molly Holly.

On February 12, 2018, it was announced that Ivory would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2018. At the ceremony on April 6, she was inducted by Molly Holly. On April 8, she appeared alongside the 2018 Hall of Fame class at WrestleMania 34.
Ivory made her in-ring return for WWE&#x27;s first ever all-women&#x27;s pay per view, WWE Evolution, to compete in a battle royal for a future title shot at the WWE Raw Women&#x27;s Championship. She lasted longer than all of the returning female legends, placing fifth after being eliminated by Asuka.
In 2019, she was in attendance for the following year&#x27;s WWE Hall of Fame ceremony in support of Torrie Wilson.

On January 29, 2022, Ivory returned to WWE in her Right To Censor gimmick, entering the 2022 Women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match at number 18. She started to cut a promo on her way to the ring and lasted an overall 25 seconds in the match, before being eliminated by Rhea Ripley. At age 60, she became the oldest woman to enter the women&#x27;s Royal Rumble, and the third oldest competitor in any Royal Rumble behind Jerry Lawler at 62, and Jimmy Snuka at 64.

<text>Elias Khalil Hrawi (; 4 September 1926 – 7 July 2006) was a Lebanese politician who served as the 10th president of Lebanon from 1989 to 1998.

==Early life and education==
Hrawi was born on 4 September 1925 in Hawch Al Umara, Zahlé, to a wealthy landowning Maronite family in the Bekaa Valley. He was the son of Khalil Hrawi and Helena Harb. He obtained a diploma in commerce at the Sagesse Institute in 1947. He enrolled at St Joseph University, Faculty of Law but did not complete his studies there.

==Business activities==
Hrawi dealt with agriculture until he became a member of Lebanon Parliament in 1972. A successful businessman, Hrawi started a vegetable-export business, dealing with major Swiss companies. He also headed the Beqaa sugarbeet cooperative. When his export business was destroyed by the 1975–1990 civil war, he switched his business to oil import.

==Career==
The scion of a politically prominent family, Hrawi followed his brothers Georges and Joseph when he was elected to the National Assembly in 1972. From 1980 to 1982, he served in the cabinet as minister of public works under President Elias Sarkis and Prime Minister Shafik Wazzan. He concentrated on building bridges and highways to link all parts of the country.

Hrawi was a member of the independent Maronite Catholic bloc in the Parliament. The bloc included nine Maronite Catholic legislators who aimed at clearing the Christian militias and maintaining positive relationships with both the Muslims and Syria.

===President of Lebanon===
Hrawi was elected at the Park Hotel in Chtoura by 47 out of 53 members of parliament on 24 November 1989 two days after the murder of Lebanon&#x27;s President René Mouawad. Five MPs cast blank ballots in the election. As President, Hrawi signed into law amendments to the Constitution that formalized the Taif Agreement reforms, giving a greater measure of power and influence to Lebanon&#x27;s Muslim community than before.

Since Baabda Palace, the president&#x27;s residence, was destroyed and bombed by Syrian troops in October 1990 to drive out General Michel Aoun, Hrawi lived in future prime minister Rafik Hariri&#x27;s Beirut apartment. On 13 October 1990, with support from the Syrian army, he forced General Aoun, who was heading a rival administration, to surrender to begin the reconstruction of Lebanon. On 22 May 1991, he signed the treaty of fraternity, co-ordination and co-operation with Syria, in which Lebanon promised not to allow its territory to be used against Syria&#x27;s interests. In 1992, Hrawi appointed Rafik Hariri as prime minister. Hrawi attended the meetings of the cabinet during his term to control the executive branch of the country.

Lebanese people had distinct opinions about Hrawi&#x27;s term. Some appreciate his decisiveness in acting against the feuding militias, ending the civil war that had been tearing the country apart for fifteen years and reuniting the major political parties of Lebanon. His supporters viewed him as a pragmatic political figure, and respected him for his long-held conviction that national loyalty should take precedence over sectarian interests, and for promoting peaceful coexistence among Lebanon&#x27;s religious factions. Conversely, Hrawi&#x27;s attempt to pass a law legitimizing civil marriage failed due to the fierce opposition from religious authorities. Some have accused him of inconsistency for disarming all Christian and most Muslim militias – but not Hezbollah, a Shi&#x27;a political party. His critics also point out that he was very supportive of Syrian interests and charge that the cooperation treaty that he signed turned Lebanon into a Syrian colony. He has also been criticized by some for having the Constitution amended to extend his term of office by three years on 13 October 1995. It is argued that it occurred after Hrawi went to Damascus and agreed on a plan by which he would be succeeded later by Emile Lahoud. Former President Amine Gemayel said at the time that such actions (which he charged were taken &quot;almost casually&quot;) undermined the delicate constitutional principles of the nation. His presidency ended on 23 November 1998.

After his term ended, Hrawi expressed his regrets about the extension of his term through the amendment of the Lebanese Constitution to Chibli Mallat.

==Personal life==
Hrawi married twice. He married Evelyn Chidiac in 1947 and became a father to three children: Rina, George and Roy. He married his second wife, Mona Jammal, in 1961, and had two children, Zalfa and Roland.

His son-in-law, Fares Boueiz, was minister of foreign affairs from 1990 to 1998. His elder sons have a firm dealing with the import of petroleum. His eldest son ran for general elections in 1992 but lost in the seat in Zahle.

===Death===
Hrawi died of cancer at the American University of Beirut Medical Center in Beirut on 7 July 2006, aged 80.

<doc id="684077" wikidata="Q2293745" url="?curid=684077" title="Arab Deterrent Force">
<text>The Arab Deterrent Force (ADF; ) was an international peacekeeping force created by the Arab League in the extraordinary Riyadh Summit on 17–18 October 1976, attended only by heads of state from Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. It decided to transform the &#x27;token&#x27; Arab Security Force into the Arab Deterrent Force. A week later, the conclusions of the Riyadh Summit were endorsed and implemented by the Arab League&#x27;s Cairo summit on 25–26 October 1976.

As the Lebanese Civil War escalated in 1976, the Arab League created an intervention force composed almost entirely of Syrian forces with token contributions from other Arab states, including Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Libya. Although nominally present at the behest of the government of Lebanon, the force was under the direct command of Syria. The ADF initially consisted of more than 35,000 troops of which 30,000 were provided by Syria. In late 1978, after the Arab League had extended the mandate of the Arab Deterrent Force, the Sudanese, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates announced intentions to withdraw troops from Lebanon, extending their stay into the early months of 1979 at the Lebanese governments request. The Libyan troops were essentially abandoned and had to find their own way home (if at all), and the ADF thereby became a purely Syrian force (which did include the Palestinian Liberation Army (PLA)).

The ADF mandate was to deter the conflicting sides from resorting to conflict again, including the tasks of maintaining cease-fire, collecting heavy weapons and supporting the Lebanese government in maintaining its authority.

Robert Fisk wrote:
[...] Since the summer of 1976, the Syrians had controlled the Bekaa Valley. The headquarters of their &#x27;Arab Deterrent Force&#x27; was at the Bekaa market town of Chtaura and their troops were billetted all the way up the valley, around the Greek Orthodox town of Zahle - where Cody and I had seen the Syrians and Phalangists cooperating in 1976 - at the airbase at Rayak, in Baalbek, and Hermel.

In 1981, the Syrian forces fought the Battle of Zahleh. R.D. Mclaurin wrote &#x27;..At the height of the battle, several Syrian Army units, totalling about 20,000 troops, were within an area 10–20 km around Zahleh.&#x27; These units included the 35th and 41st Brigades (Special Forces), 47th and 62nd Brigade (Mechanised Infantry), 51st Brigade (Ind. Armoured), and 67th Brigade, of which the last was along the border with Syria, southwest of Medina Sinaia.

A year after Israel invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War, the Lebanese government failed to extend the ADF&#x27;s mandate, thereby effectively ending its existence, although not the Syrian or Israeli military presence in Lebanon. Eventually the Syrian presence became known as the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.

==Operations and Peacekeeping==

At 4:30 AM Monday November 15, 1976 The Arab Deterrent Forces consisting of 5,000 Sudanese, Saudi and Emirati Soldiers and 25,000 Syrian Soldiers deployed in and around Beirut in an attempt to cease hostilities between the Kataeb/Phalangist Lebanese government and the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Syrian peacekeepers began distributing weapons and support to pro-Syrian factions within both parties in Beirut at the time which lead to accusations that Syria was acting more as an occupying force and less as a peace-keeping force. On July 21, 1977, The Lebanese and Palestinian factions agreed on a compromise that would see the withdrawal of all PLO soldiers inside a 15 kilometer zone just off the Israeli Border and the Lebanese government would work in conjunction with the Arab Deterrent Force to ensure security of Lebanon. on July 30, 1977, Syrian soldiers were deployed in The Beqaa Valley and near Tripoli. June 1983 would seem the fracturing of the compromise between the Lebanese Government, the Arab Deterrent Forces and the Syrian Peacekeepers especially after the 1982 Israeli Invasion of Lebanon.

<doc id="684079" wikidata="Q780629" url="?curid=684079" title="Panniculitis">
<text>Panniculitis is a group of diseases whose hallmark is inflammation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (the fatty layer under the skin – panniculus adiposus). Symptoms include tender skin nodules, and systemic signs such as weight loss and fatigue.

Restated, an inflammatory disorder primarily localized in the subcutaneous fat is termed a &quot;panniculitis&quot;, a group of disorders that may be challenging both for the clinician and the dermatopathologist. The general term for inflammation of any adipose tissue is [[steatitis]].

==Signs and symptoms==
Panniculitis can also be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms. Panniculitis without systemic disease can be a result of trauma or cold. Panniculitis with systemic disease can be caused by:
* connective tissue disorders such as lupus erythematosus or scleroderma;
* lymphoproliferative disease such as lymphoma or histiocytosis;
* pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer;
* sarcoidosis with cutaneous involvement (seen in up to 20 percent);
* Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency
* Crohn&#x27;s disease

This is not a complete list of possible causes.

===Associated conditions===
Lipoatrophy or lipodystrophy (the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue) can occur in any of these conditions.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
It can occur in any fatty tissue (cutaneous or visceral) and is often diagnosed on the basis of a deep skin biopsy, and can be further classified by histological characteristics based on the location of the inflammatory cells (within fatty lobules or in the septa which separate them) and on the presence or absence of vasculitis.

There are thus four main histological subtypes:
# lobular panniculitis without vasculitis (acute panniculitis, previously termed Weber–Christian disease, systemic nodular panniculitis)
# lobular panniculitis with vasculitis
# septal panniculitis without vasculitis
# septal panniculitis with vasculitis

====Lobular====

=====With vasculitis=====
Erythema induratum, or &quot;Bazin disease&quot;, is a panniculitis on the back of the calves. It was formerly thought to be a reaction to the tuberculum bacillus. It is now considered a panniculitis that is not associated with a single defined pathogen.

Nodular vasculitis is a skin condition characterized by small, tender, reddened nodules on the legs, mostly on the calves and shins. Microscopically there are epithelioid granulomas and vasculitis in the subcutaneous tissue, making it a form of panniculitis. Most of these cases are now thought to be manifestation of tuberculosis and indeed they respond well to anti-tuberculous treatment.

=====Without vasculitis=====
Non-vasculitis forms of panniculitis that may occur include:
* &quot;Cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis&quot; was first described in 1980 by Winkelmann as a chronic histiocytic disease of the subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is characterized clinically by tender erythematous nodules, recurrent high fever, malaise, jaundice, organomegaly, serosal effusions, pancytopenia, hepatic dysfunction and coagulation abnormalities. CHP may occur either isolated or as part of cutaneous manifestations of hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). CHP is a rare and often fatal form of panniculitis with multisystem involvement. But it can also present in a benign form involving only the subcutaneous tissue, thus having a broad clinical spectrum.
* &quot;Traumatic panniculitis&quot; is a panniculitis that occurs following trauma to the skin.
* &quot;Cold panniculitis&quot; is a panniculitis occurring after exposure to cold, most often seen in infants and young children. This condition has been described in children who suck ice or popsicles, and therefore is sometimes referred to as &quot;popsicle panniculitis.&quot; The term was coined when a patient with a rash of unknown origin on her cheek was taken to a dermatologist.
* &quot;Gouty panniculitis&quot; is a panniculitis caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in gout.
* &quot;Pancreatic panniculitis&quot; (also known as enzymatic panniculitis, Pancreatic fat necrosis, and subcutaneous fat necrosis) is a panniculitis most commonly associated with pancreatic carcinoma, and more rarely with anatomic pancreatic abnormalities, pseudocysts, or drug-induced pancreatitis.
* &quot;Factitial panniculitis&quot; is a panniculitis that may be induced by the injection of organic materials, povidone, feces, saliva, vaginal fluid, and oils.

====With needle-shaped clefts====
Lipodermatosclerosis is a form of panniculitis associated with chronic venous insufficiency that presents with brown indurations on the front of the shins. It may be associated with pain and other signs of chronic venous insufficiency. The exact cause is unknown.

Other forms include:
* Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn, a form of panniculitis occurring in newborns that is usually self-resolving, that may be a result of hypoxic injury to relatively high levels of brown fat.
* Sclerema neonatorum, affecting premature births.
* Weber–Christian disease, a symmetrical form of the disease of unknown origin occurring in middle-aged women.
* Lupus erythematosus panniculitis, panniculitis associated with lupus erythematosus.
* Forms associated with use of high doses of systemic corticosteroids during rapid corticosteroid withdrawal, and from the injection of silicone or mineral oils.

====Septal====

=====Erythema nodosum=====

Erythema nodosum is a form of panniculitis characterised by tender red nodules, 1–10 cm, associated with systemic symptoms including fever, malaise, and joint pain. Nodules may become bluish-purple, yellowing, and green, and subside over a period of 2–6 weeks without ulcerating or scarring. Erythema nodosum is associated with infections, including Hepatitis C, EBV and tuberculosis, Crohn&#x27;s disease and sarcoidosis, pregnancy, medications including sulfonamides, and some cancers, including Non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pancreatic cancer.

=====A1AT-deficiency-associated=====

<text>The Super Cup or Super Powers Cup was an international rugby union competition contested from 2003 to 2005. It featured teams representing Canada, Japan, Russia, the United States and Romania.

==Tournaments==

=== 2003 ===

The Super Powers Cup was first launched in 2003. It was planned that China, Japan, Russia and the United States would play each other once. However, because of the SARS outbreak the Chinese team were forced to withdraw.

Russia won the inaugural 2003 competition, defeating the United States 30–21 in Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

=== 2004 ===

For the 2004 competition Canada joined the competition. In May of that year Japan won the second edition of the Super Powers Cup in Tokyo, where the entire tournament had been staged, beating Russia 29–12 and Canada 34–21 in the process. The United States defeated Russia in the third-place playoff.

=== 2005 ===

In 2005 the tournament was renamed the Super Cup and the participants were again changed, with Romania taking the place of Russia. Romania had been given &#x27;second tier&#x27; status by the International Rugby Board (IRB), meaning greater funding and integration into the international calendar, while Russia were at the time considered a third tier nation.

Canada and Japan met in the final, with the Canadians winning 15–10. The United States beat a Romanian team missing many of their France-based professionals 23–16 in the third place play-off.

==Dissolution==
The competition was discontinued in 2005 after the IRB undertook a new Strategic Investment programme, with funding instead going to several new tournaments including the Pacific Nations Cup, featuring Japan (since 2006), Canada and United States (since 2013), as well as the IRB Nations Cup and IRB Tbilisi Cup, involving European, African and South American teams.

In February 2009, representatives from the IRB, Rugby Canada, the Japan Rugby Football Union, the Rugby Union of Russia and USA Rugby met to discuss the possibility of reviving the tournament under the Super Powers Cup name, beginning in November 2010, but nothing materialized.

<doc id="684085" wikidata="Q119744" url="?curid=684085" title="Solitary nucleus">
<text>The solitary nucleus (SN) (nucleus of the solitary tract, nucleus solitarius, or nucleus tractus solitarii) is a series of neurons whose cell bodies form a roughly vertical column of grey matter in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. Their axons form the bulk of the enclosed solitary tract. The solitary nucleus can be divided into different parts including dorsomedial, dorsolateral, and ventrolateral subnuclei.

The solitary nucleus receives general visceral and special visceral inputs from the facial nerve (CN VII), glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and vagus nerve (CN X); it receives and relays stimuli related to taste and visceral sensation. It sends outputs to various parts of the brain, such as the hypothalamus, thalamus, and reticular formation, forming circuits that contribute to autonomic regulation. 

Cells along the length of the SN are arranged roughly in accordance with function; for instance, cells involved in taste are located in the rostral part, while those receiving information from cardio-respiratory and gastrointestinal processes are found in the caudal part. The cells involved in taste are the part of the solitary nucleus referred to as the gustatory nucleus.

== Anatomy ==
The solitary nucleus is a series of neurons in the medulla oblongata. Their cell bodies form a roughly vertical column of grey matter in the medulla oblongata. Their axons form an enclosed nerve tract called the solitary tract. 

=== Viscerotopic organization ===
Neurons of the SN are notably functionally arranged roughly length-wise along the nucleus: gustatory neurons are situated rostrally (with afferents from the anterior part of the tongue and roof of oral cavity rostral-most, and those from the larynx and epiglottis more caudally placed); gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory neurons are situated more caudally. However, some localization/organization also occurs along the ventro-dorsal and medio-lateral axes.

=== Afferents ===
* Gustatory (taste) sensation from facial nerve (CN VII) via the chorda tympani (from anterior 2/3 of tongue), glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) (from posterior 1/3 of tongue), and vagus nerve (CN X) (from epiglottis).
* Chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors of the general visceral afferent pathway (GVA) from the carotid body and carotid sinus via (the carotid sinus nerve of) CN IX; from aortic bodies and aortic arch via CN X.
* Chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors of the general visceral afferent pathway (GVA) with endings located in the heart, lungs, airways, gastrointestinal system, pharynx, and liver via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. Organ specific regions of neuronal architecture are preserved in the solitary nucleus. Additional minor GVA input from the nasal cavity, soft palate and sinus cavities enters via the facial nerve.
Non-sensory afferent projections include:
* medial zone of hypothalamus → dorsal longitudinal fasciculus → periaqueductal gray → autonomic input of solitary nucleus

=== Efferents ===
The solitary nucleus projects to numerous regions of the CNS, including:

* thalamus (mediates autonomic responses, conscious taste sensation, conscious visceral sensations like stomach fullness/emptiness)
** (medial-most portion of) ventral posteromedial nucleus of thalamus → (via third-order neuron) sensory cortex and insular cortex
* paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus → limbic system (mediates autonomic responses)
* reticular formation (mediates autonomic responses)
* parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (for autonomic responses) 
* central nucleus of the amygdala
* parabrachial area
* locus coeruleus
* dorsal raphe nucleus
* solitariospinal tract → upper levels of spinal cord
* other visceral motor or respiratory centers

The SN projects to multiple other cranial nerve nuclei:
* salivatory nuclei
* hypoglossal nucleus
* dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve
* nucleus ambiguus (to mediate gag reflex)

== Function ==
Afferents of the SN mediate the gag reflex, the carotid sinus reflex, the aortic reflex, the cough reflex, the baroreflex and chemoreceptor reflexes, several respiratory reflexes and reflexes within the gastrointestinal system regulating motility and secretion.

Neurons which transmit signals about the gut wall, the stretch of the lungs, and the dryness of mucous membranes also innervate the SN. The first central neurons within the SN can participate in simple autonomic reflexes.

=== Gag reflex arc ===
The afferent limb of the gag reflex arc is conveyed by sensory afferents of the CN IX which terminate in the SN; the SN then projects to the nucleus ambiguus which in turn gives rise to motor efferent fibers of the CN IX/X which then mediate the efferent limb of the arc.

<text>Casula () is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 34 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool.

Casula is the first suburb immediately south of Liverpool on the Hume Highway and the Main Southern railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. Casula consists of undulating, gently rolling land, with elevations across the suburb being mostly between 30 and 70 metres above sea level. The Georges River forms the eastern boundary of the suburb, and its western bank is paralleled by a relatively steep escarpment.

== Aboriginal ==

The original inhabitants of the Casula area were the Tharawal or &quot;Dharawal&quot; people of the greater Eora nation, an Aboriginal Australian group. &quot;Tharawal&quot; refers to the country and people who belong to greater southern and south-western Sydney. The Tharawal Local Aboriginal Land Council (LALC) extends through Liverpool, Camden, Campbelltown and Wollondilly Local Government Areas (LGAs). The totem animal for Tharawal country is the superb lyrebird &quot;(Menura novaehollandiae)&quot;.

== European ==

Casula was first settled by agriculturalists in the nineteenth century, among them Richard Guise, who named his farm &quot;Casula&quot;. The area became dominated by poultry farming, market gardening and fruit growing. Another notable farm was Glenfield Farm, which dates from circa 1817. Situated in Leacocks Lane, it originally belonged to politician Charles Throsby, a member of the Legislative Council and an explorer. The farm is the oldest continuously worked farm in Australia and is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

During World War I, a large Australian Imperial Forces recruitment and training reserve was located in Casula – a fact reflected by the name of one of its major residential streets, &quot;Reserve Road&quot;. This camp became briefly notorious in 1916 when a large mob of soldiers rebelled against the strict training regimen, marched on nearby Liverpool, ransacked and looted several pubs, hijacked several trains to Central station in Sydney and continued their drunken rioting, resulting in the Military Police shooting dead one rioter.

In 1918, Walter Ingham Sr. bought of bush land in Casula as a gift to 18-year-old son, Walter. On his death in 1953, his sons Jack and Bob took over the small chicken breeding operation and built it into the largest producer of chickens and turkeys in Australia. Inghams is now headquartered in Liverpool.

Casula Post Office opened on 1 February 1924 and closed in 1979. A &quot;Liverpool South&quot; office was renamed &quot;Cross Roads&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Casula Mall&quot; in 1990 and remains open.

Being heavily farmed, the area did not become suburbanised until the late 1950s. Much of the acreage in the central and southern portions were subdivided and developed over the next few decades but even now there are pockets of undeveloped land.

==Heritage listings==
Casula has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 88 Leacocks Lane: Glenfield Farm

==Environment==

The ecological community that once covered vast areas (125,000 Ha) of South-western Sydney, including Casula is known as the Cumberland Plain Woodland.

===Leacock Regional Park===
The National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service Leacock Regional park is home to one of the last remaining stands of Cumberland Plain Woodland. It is also home to the critically endangered Cumberland Plain Land Snail &quot;(Meridolum corneovirens)&quot;. The ridge line at the top of the park offers views to the Holsworthy bush land. The bellbird walking track takes you through the remnant stand of Cumberland Plain Woodland and can be linked to a track along the Georges River where a lookout can be found by the Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre. The &#x27;Weaving Garden&#x27; bush regeneration group are currently bush regenerating within the reserve.

==Landmarks==

The Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre (CPAC), which is situated next to Casula railway station, was a former 1950s power station. After falling into disrepair, the building was refurbished and reopened in 1994 as an arts centre. As well as hosting a wide variety of exhibitions and arts events reflecting its multicultural community, CPAC has been host to the Blake Prize, an art prize focused on spirituality, since 2016.

==Commercial area==
Casula Mall is a shopping centre owned by AMP Capital and opened in 1986. It consists of a Kmart discount department store, a Coles supermarket and approximately forty specialty shops. Crossroads Homemaker Centre is another shopping centre in Casula also owned by AMP Capital. It is situated at the southern end of Casula, containing Bunnings Warehouse hardware and Costco, numerous bedding and furniture stores, electrical stores such as Bing Lee and The Good Guys.

==Transport==
Casula is bordered on the north and west by the M5 Motorway, with continuous freeway-standard highway to central Sydney and the North Shore. The Hume Highway cuts through the centre of Casula.

Casula railway station is on the Main Southern railway line. But it is located far from the commercial area. Relatively frequent Transit Systems bus services link Casula to the major commercial and retail centre of Liverpool and Liverpool station.

Glenfield station also serves Casula, being the station of choice for many Casula commuters due to easier accessibility as well as an significantly faster service into Sydney. Buses link Casula and Glenfield travelling via the Hume Highway.

==Schools==
Casula Primary School was opened on De Meyrick Avenue in 1959, and Casula High School opened in 1973. All Saints Catholic Senior College is the only Catholic school in the suburb being opened in 1987.

==Housing==
Casula is notable for its variable demographics and mixture of socio-economic levels existing side by side. The central and southern areas consist mainly of privately owned houses including the locally famous ranch-style mansion on Old Kurrajong Road owned by Bob Ingham.

==Population==
According to the , Casula had a population of 16,584, which was substantially families. Of occupied private dwellings in Casula, 71.1% were separate houses, 24.7% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses, townhouses etc., 4.1% were flats or apartments and 0.0% were other dwellings.

<text>Mylapore (also spelt Mayilapur), or Thirumayilai, is a neighbourhood in the central part of the city of Chennai, India. It is one of the oldest residential parts of the city. The locality is claimed to be the birthplace of the celebrated Tamil philosopher Valluvar, and the Hindu saint and philosopher, Peyalvar. It is also believed by Christians to be the place of martyrdom of St. Thomas the Apostle, who preached along the Malabar Coast, and established the Malankara Nasrani community. 

Mylapore is known for its tree-lined avenues, Kapaleeshwarar Temple, Katcheri seasons, and Ramakrishna Matha among many others. St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica, Chennai which is believed to house the tomb of Thomas the Apostle, is in Mylapore.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Mylapore&quot; is the anglicized form of the Dravidian word &quot;Mayilāppūr&quot;. It is derived from the Tamil phrase , which means &#x27;land of the peacock scream&#x27;. Historically, peacocks have been known to thrive in the area, which is evident from the several statues in the Kapaleeshwarar Temple towers and in the emblem of the San Thome Basilica. Thirugnanasambandar has also mentioned &quot;mayil&quot; (peacocks) in his songs in Tevaram. Mylapore is also known as Thirumayilai.

==History==
Mylapore is an ancient settlement. It was historically known as Vedapuri. As the available historical and archaeological evidence show, it could well be the oldest part of Chennai, with written records of early settlements going back to the first century BCE. Thiruvalluvar, the Tamil poet-philosopher, is believed to have been born here in 31 BCE. It was known for its ancient port with a flourishing trade with the Roman Empire, receiving gold in exchange for its products like pepper and fine cloth. St. Thomas the Apostle allegedly died at Mylapore in 72 CE. Ptolemy had recorded in the second century CE that the port of Mylapore was known to the Greeks and the Romans, but does not mention any thing about St. Thomas or Christians. The Saivite Saints of the seventh century, Saint Sambandar and Saint Appar, have sung about the shrine in their hymns. Mention has been made of the early settlement of Santhome (currently known) by Arab travelers and merchants of the ninth and tenth centuries. Marco Polo visited the place in the late 13th century and left a detailed description of the land, the people along with their customs and religion and also visited the tomb of Saint Thomas the Apostle in Mylapore (currently Santhome).

It was considerable maritime time and the ancient German and Greek maps refer to the town as &#x27;Maliarpha&#x27;. The later Scottish researchers like James Playfair referred it &quot;Meliapour&quot; Mylapore was occupied by the Portuguese in 1523, who established the viceroyalty of &quot;São Tomé de Meliapor&quot; or &quot;Saint Thomas of Mylapore.&quot; Portuguese rule lasted until 1749, except for a brief interregnum between 1662 and 1687, when the town was occupied by the Dutch.

After 1749, the British East India Company took possession of the settlement in the name of Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot. In that same year, Mylapore was incorporated into the administration of the Presidency of Madras. The settlement known as &quot;Luz&quot; developed during this period. The name finds its origins from the &#x27;Nossa Senhora Da Luz&#x27; (Our Lady of Light) church built by the Portuguese in 1516 CE. This church is one of the oldest standing Christian structures in all of Tamil Nadu.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the town became the commercial and intellectual hub of Madras city and home to British-educated lawyers and statesmen, the most elite of whom formed the Mylapore clique. Some of the luminaries based in Mylapore included Sir V. Bhashyam Aiyangar, Sir S. Subramania Iyer, Sir T. Madhava Rao, Eardley Norton, Sir P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, Pennathur Subramania Iyer, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, and Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer.
H Bhimasena Rau, C S Rama Rao Sahib, Subanthore Vasudeva Rao, CR Krishnaswamy Rao Sahib, and the civil engineer C R Narayana Rao.

==Location==

Mylapore is located a few kilometres to the south of the British-built Chennai city. The neighborhood is bordered by Triplicane in the north, Royapettah in the northwest, Alwarpet in the west, and Mandaveli in the south. The Bay of Bengal coast is in the east of Mylapore. It extends for around 4 km from north to south and 2 km from east to west.

==Demographics==
The population of Mylapore is estimated to be around 150,000 to 300,000. It has long been a site of cultural importance for Brahmins, which can be attributed to Mylapore&#x27;s early role as a temple centre. Smartha Brahmins, a sub-sect, were one of the first people to settle in this township. More accurate statistics are not available as Mylapore is not a separate township by itself, but a part of Chennai city. The different neighbourhoods within Mylapore have been distributed among the different wards of the Chennai Corporation.

==Notable people==
* Peyalvar, one of the twelve alvar saints of South India, in held in popular tradition to have been found in the lily flower in the pond of the Adi Kesava Perumal Temple in Mylapore in 4203 BCE.
* Valluvar, the Tamil poet philosopher and the author of the Tirukkural, was born in Mylapore in 31 BCE.
* According to legends, St. Thomas the Apostle attained martyrdom at Parangimalai in south Chennai in 72 CE. San Thome Basilica is built over his original tomb in Mylapore. His relics were moved to Edessa in the third century.

==Important places==


Mylapore is known for its cultural and religious heritage. Mylapore is home to hundreds of temples, churches and mosques.

===Kapaleeswarar Temple===
Kapaleeswarar Temple is one of the most famous temples of Chennai. The temple was originally relocated by the Tuluva dynasty (1491–1570 CE) from the sea shore of Mylapore. The main deity of the temple is Shiva. The temple exhibits exquisite Dravidian architecture. The huge temple is surrounded by traditional crowded street markets selling fruits, flowers, vegetables and traditional brass ware.

===Adi Kesava Perumal Temple===
Mylapore is known for the Adi Kesava Perumal Temple constructed in honor of Keshava or Vishnu, a principal god in the Hindu pantheon and the &quot;Preserver&quot; in the Hindu trinity. The temple has an idol of Vishnu accompanied by his celestial consort Goddess Lakshmi. This is the birthplace of Peyalvar. It has sannathis for the thayar Mayuravalli, Chakkarathalvar, Sri Andal, Sri Rama &amp; Anjaneya. It is the &quot;avatara sthalam&quot; (birthplace) of Peyalvar and has a separate sannithi for the Alvar. During the brahmotsavam the utsavar goes in a procession accompanied by Sridevi &amp; Bhudevi in the mada streets and also gives the chance to see the Theppam festival in the centuries-old kulam (tank). Every year the Parthasarathy Perumal comes to the Kesava Perumal temple and Kesava Perumal too goes to Triplicane along with Peyalvar.

===Sri Vedantha Desikar Devasthanam/Sri Srinivasar Koil===
Mylapore has the Srinivasar temple near Chitra Kulam in Mylapore, which is administered by the Vedantha Desikar Devasthanam (SVDD). It is located beside the Adi Kesava Perumal Temple, which has an imposing gopuram that can be seen from quite a distance.

===Valluvar Koil===
The Ekambareswarar–Kamakshi Koil, commonly known as the Valluvar Koil, is also located in the neighborhood. The Valluvar shrine is located within the Ekambareswarar temple complex and is dedicated to the poet-saint Valluvar. Dating back to at least the early 16th century, the temple was extensively renovated in the 1970s. Considered to be the birthplace of Valluvar, the temple is the oldest ever built to Valluvar. The temple also serves as the venue for meetings of Tamil language enthusiasts. While many consider the temple as the birthplace of Valluvar, some consider it as his samadhi (place of cremation).

===Madhava Perumal Temple===
Madhava Perumal Temple is dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Madhava Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Amirtagadavalli. According to some, the temple is believed to be the birthplace of Peyalvar, one of the first three of the twelve Alvar saints of the sixth to ninth century CE.

===Ramakrishna Math===
Sri Ramakrishna Mutt, is the oldest center of the Ramakrishna Order in the South India. Sri Ramakrishna is the main deity of the temple. Architecture of the temple is a blend of Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, Rajput, and Christian styles. The sprawling campus contains several huge quiet halls for &quot;dhyana&quot;, the Sanskrit word for meditation. The book store on the campus sells books on Indian epics - Ramayana and Mahabharatha, talks, travels and works of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Swami Vivekananda, as well as the philosophy of Vedanta along with monthly magazines. The monks conduct lectures and interviews in English on Sunday evenings from 5:30 PM to 6:30 PM.
===San Thome Basilica===
San Thome Basilica, built over the tomb of Thomas the Apostle, is a Roman Catholic minor basilica at Santhome in the city of Chennai. Thomas is traditionally believed to have sailed to Muziris in modern-day Kerala India in 52 CE. The Saint Thomas Christians or Nasrani Christians of Kerala are believed to have been converted by St Thomas. Tradition has it that Thomas was killed in 72 CE at Mylapore and his body was interred here. His relics were moved to Edessa in the third century. San Thome Basilica was built over his original tomb in the 16th century by Portuguese explorers, and rebuilt with the status of a cathedral by the British in 1893 which still stands. San Thome Basilica is the principal church of the Madras-Mylapore Roman Catholic Archdiocese. In 1956, Pope Pius XII raised the church to the status of a Minor Basilica, and on 11 February 2006, it was declared a national shrine by the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of India. It is an important pilgrimage center for the Syrian Christians of Kerala. The church also has an attached museum.

===Luz Church===
Church of Our Lady of Light is a Roman Catholic shrine in the locality. It is commonly called as Luz Church by the locals, which derives from the Portuguese name Nossa Senhora da Luz. Built in 1516 by the Portuguese, it is one of the oldest Churches in the city and its foundation stone marks as one of the oldest European monuments in India. The history of the church dates back to the 16th-century legend of safe arrival to land by missionaries. The church is located very near to the Santhome Basilica, where Apostle Thomas is believed to be buried.

Although at the time the church was built, the locality was a thick forest, now it is part of a bustling metropolitan area. This 16th century European architecture building consists of patterns of Gothic arches and Baroque ornamentation. The feast of Our Lady of Light is celebrated on 15 August every year.

<text>Gelibolu is a town in Çanakkale Province of the Marmara Region, located in Eastern Thrace in the European part of Turkey. It is located on the southern shore of the peninsula named after it on the Dardanelles strait, away from Lapseki on the other shore. It is the seat of Gelibolu District. Its population is 31,782 (2021).

==History==
The Macedonian city of Callipolis was founded in the 5th century B.C. It has a rich history as a naval base for various rulers.

The emperor Justinian I fortified Gallipoli and established important military warehouses for corn and wine there, of which some Byzantine ruins can still be seen. After the capture of Constantinople by the Latins in 1204, Gallipoli passed into the power of the Republic of Venice. In 1294 the Genoese defeated a Venetian force in the neighbourhood. The Catalan Company, a body of Almogavars, under Roger de Flor, established themselves here in 1306, and after the death of their leader massacred almost all the citizens; they were vainly besieged by the allied troops of Venice and the Byzantine Empire, and withdrew in 1307, after dismantling the fortifications. After the city&#x27;s defenses were damaged in an earthquake, it was conquered by Turks in 1354 and became the first stronghold of the Ottoman Empire in Europe. Sultan Bayezid I (1389–1403) built a castle and tower there which can still be seen. In 1416 the Venetians under Pietro Loredan defeated the Turks here. Gallipoli is the site of &quot;tombs of the Thracian kings&quot;, which refers to the graves of the Islamic writers Ahmed Bican (died 1466) and his brother Mehmed Bican (died 1451).


Throughout the Ottoman period, the town was the capital of the Sanjak of Gelibolu, and the original center of the Eyalet of the Kapudan Pasha; between 1864 and 1920 the town belonged to the Edirne Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. In 1904 the Greek bishopric of Kallipolis was promoted to a metropolis and is listed under the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.

From the early 17th century until the early 20th century, a relatively large number of Sephardic Jews lived in Gallipoli, descendants of those fleeing the Spanish Inquisition.

In 1854 the town was occupied by the allied French and British armies during the Crimean War who strengthened the defensive constructions from 1357. Many soldiers died there of cholera and are buried in a local cemetery. The guns of Gallipoli guarded the sea of Marmara until 1878 when more fortifications were built when the Russians threatened to take possession of Constantinople.

The Bulgarian Army threatened Gelibolu during the First Balkan War and advanced to Bolayır in 1912. During the First World War the peninsula and the town were witness to a series of memorable battles (see Gallipoli Campaign). The town was occupied by the Greek army in 1920–1922, and finally returned to Turkey in 1923 under the Treaty of Lausanne. Like the island Imbros off the western shore of the peninsula, Gallipoli had had a majority of Greek inhabitants from ancient times until World War I. It was exempted in article 2 from the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations (1923), however, the Greek inhabitants were expelled or killed during the Turkish War of Independence. Between 1922 and 1926 the town was a provincial center and the districts of Gelibolu, Eceabat, Keşan (Enez became part of Keşan before 1953) and Şarköy.

== Bishopric ==

A Christian bishopric, a suffragan of Heraclea, the capital and metropolitan see of the Roman province of Europa. Extant documents give the names of three of its bishops of the period before the East–West Schism: Cyrillus, who was at the Council of Ephesus in 431; Harmonius, who took part in a synod that Patriarch Menas of Constantinople held in 536 to condemn the Miaphysite Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople; Melchisedec, who participated in the Second Council of Nicaea (787).

The bishopric continued to be a see of the Greek Orthodox Church until after the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Le Quien mentions three of those bishops who lived in the 14th and 15th centuries. Beginning in the early 13th century, there were also Latin Church bishops of Callipolis.

No longer a residential bishopric, Callipolis is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

<doc id="684142" wikidata="Q4763604" url="?curid=684142" title="Anglo-Celtic">
<text>Anglo-Celtic people are descended primarily from English and Irish, Scottish or Welsh people. The concept is mainly relevant outside of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, particularly in Australia, but is also used in Canada, the United States, New Zealand and South Africa, where a significant diaspora is located.

== Origins ==
The term is a combination of the combining form &quot;Anglo-&quot; and the adjective &quot;Celtic&quot;. &quot;Anglo-&quot;, meaning &quot;English&quot; is derived from the Angles, a Germanic people who settled in Britain (mainly in what is now England) in the middle of the first millennium. The name &quot;England&quot; ( or ) originates from these people. &quot;Celtic&quot;, in this context, refers to the people of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, the Isle of Man and Cornwall.

== Usage in literature ==
Recorded usage dates as far back to at least the mid-19th century. A newspaper of the name, &quot;The Anglo-Celt&quot; (pronounced in this case as &#x27;Anglo-Selt&#x27;), was founded in County Cavan in Ireland in 1846. In an 1869 publication, the term was contrasted with Anglo-Saxon as a more appropriate term for people of English, Irish, Scottish and Welsh descent worldwide:

&quot;Anglo-Saxon,&quot; as applied to the modern British people, and Britannic race, I believe every impartial scholar will agree with me in thinking a gross misnomer. For if it can be shown that there is a large Celtic element even in the population of England itself, still more unquestionable is this, not only with regard to the populations the British Isles generally, but also with reference to the English-speaking peoples of America and Australasia. Even the English are rather Anglo-Celts than Anglo-Saxons, and still more certainly is Anglo-Celtic a more accurate term than Anglo-Saxon, not only for that British nationality which includes the Scots, the Irish and the Welsh; but also for that Britannic race, chief elements in the formation of which have been Welsh, Scottish and Irish immigrants.

The term lends itself to the term &quot;Anglo-Celtic Isles&quot;, an alternative term for the &quot;British Isles&quot;. Use in this term can be seen in a 1914 Irish unionist ballad:
The United Anglo-Celtic Isles
Will e&#x27;er be blessed by Freedoms smiles
No tyrant can our homes subdue
While Britons to the Celts are true.
The false may clamour to betray
The brave will still uphold our sway
The triple-sacred flag as yet
Supreme, its sun shall never set
— Southern Unionist Ballad (Ennis Unionist, 1914)

<doc id="684143" wikidata="Q1781358" url="?curid=684143" title="Wedge sum">
<text>In topology, the wedge sum is a &quot;one-point union&quot; of a family of topological spaces. Specifically, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are pointed spaces (i.e. topological spaces with distinguished basepoints formula_1 and formula_2) the wedge sum of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is the quotient space of the disjoint union of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; by the identification formula_3
formula_4 

where formula_5 is the equivalence closure of the relation formula_6
More generally, suppose formula_7 is an indexed family of pointed spaces with basepoints formula_8 The wedge sum of the family is given by:
formula_9
where formula_5 is the equivalence closure of the relation formula_11 
In other words, the wedge sum is the joining of several spaces at a single point. This definition is sensitive to the choice of the basepoints formula_12 unless the spaces formula_7 are homogeneous.

The wedge sum is again a pointed space, and the binary operation is associative and commutative (up to homeomorphism).

Sometimes the wedge sum is called the wedge product, but this is not the same concept as the exterior product, which is also often called the wedge product.

==Examples==
The wedge sum of two circles is homeomorphic to a figure-eight space. The wedge sum of formula_14 circles is often called a &quot;bouquet of circles&quot;, while a wedge product of arbitrary spheres is often called a bouquet of spheres.

A common construction in homotopy is to identify all of the points along the equator of an formula_14-sphere formula_16. Doing so results in two copies of the sphere, joined at the point that was the equator:
formula_17

Let formula_18 be the map formula_19 that is, of identifying the equator down to a single point. Then addition of two elements formula_20 of the formula_14-dimensional homotopy group formula_22 of a space formula_23 at the distinguished point formula_24 can be understood as the composition of formula_25 and formula_26 with formula_18:
formula_28

Here, formula_29 are maps which take a distinguished point formula_30 to the point formula_31 Note that the above uses the wedge sum of two functions, which is possible precisely because they agree at formula_32 the point common to the wedge sum of the underlying spaces.

==Categorical description==
The wedge sum can be understood as the coproduct in the category of pointed spaces. Alternatively, the wedge sum can be seen as the pushout of the diagram formula_33 in the category of topological spaces (where formula_34 is any one-point space).

==Properties==
Van Kampen&#x27;s theorem gives certain conditions (which are usually fulfilled for well-behaved spaces, such as CW complexes) under which the fundamental group of the wedge sum of two spaces formula_23 and formula_36 is the free product of the fundamental groups of formula_23 and formula_38

<text>The Ford Del Rey is a large family car produced by Ford do Brasil in Brazil from 1981 to 1991. It was a successor to the Ford Landau as the flagship model of the lineup and to the higher priced versions of the popular Ford Corcel II. Like the Corcel II, the Del Rey was designed exclusively for Brazil, but was sold in Chile, Venezuela, Uruguay, and Paraguay, as well. 


The Del Rey was offered as a two-door coupé, four-door sedan, or three-door station wagon, named Scala until 1985, when it adopted the name Belina as used by Corcel. A two-door convertible prototype was also shown in 1982, but never entered production. The vehicle was offered in many models, originally as the Prata (silver) and Ouro (gold) as basic and top-of-the-line versions between 1981 and 1984. Between 1985 and 1991, the versions (from most basic to top) were L, GL, GLX, and Ghia. It was offered with two engines, a CHT 1.6-L inline four and a VW-developed 1.8-L inline four, both which were fueled by gasoline or ethanol. The transmissions were a standard five-speed manual and an optional three-speed automatic. The Del Rey was replaced by the Ford Versailles in 1991, which was based on the Volkswagen Santana, built in an association between Ford and VW called Autolatina.

<doc id="684160" wikidata="Q1528394" url="?curid=684160" title="Iontophoresis">
<text>Iontophoresis is a process of transdermal drug delivery by use of a voltage gradient on the skin. Molecules are transported across the stratum corneum by electrophoresis and electroosmosis and the electric field can also increase the permeability of the skin. These phenomena, directly and indirectly, constitute active transport of matter due to an applied electric current. The transport is measured in units of chemical flux, commonly μmol/(cm2×hour). 
Iontophoresis has experimental, therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

==Uses==

===Laboratory uses===
Iontophoresis is useful in laboratory experiments, especially in neuropharmacology. Transmitter molecules naturally pass signals between neurons. By microelectrophoretic techniques, including microiontophoresis, neurotransmitters and other chemical agents can be artificially administered very near living and naturally functioning neurons, the activity of which can be simultaneously recorded. This is used to elucidate their pharmacological properties and natural roles.

===Therapeutic uses===
Therapeutically, electromotive drug administration (EMDA) delivers a medicine or other chemical through the skin. In a manner of speaking, it is an injection without a needle, and may be described as non-invasive. It is different from dermal patches, which do not rely on an electric field. It drives a charged substance, usually a medication or bioactive agent, transdermally by repulsive electromotive force, through the skin. A small electric current is applied to an iontophoretic chamber placed on the skin, containing a charged active agent and its solvent vehicle. Another chamber or a skin electrode carries the return current. One or two chambers are filled with a solution containing an active ingredient and its solvent vehicle. The positively charged chamber, called the anode, will repel a positively charged chemical species, whereas the negatively charged chamber, called the cathode, will repel a negatively charged species into the skin.

It is used to treat some types of palmar-plantar hyperhidrosis. In the treatment of hyperhidrosis, tap water is often the chosen solution for mild and medium forms. In very serious cases of hyperhidrosis, a solution containing glycopyrronium bromide or glycopyrrolate, a cholinergic inhibitor, can be used.

===Diagnostic uses===
Iontophoresis of acetylcholine is used in research as a way to test the health of the endothelium by stimulating endothelium-dependent generation of nitric oxide and subsequent microvascular vasodilation. Acetylcholine is positively charged and is therefore placed in the anode chamber.

Pilocarpine iontophoresis is often used to stimulate sweat secretion, as part of cystic fibrosis diagnosis.

&quot;Reverse iontophoresis&quot; is a technique by which molecules are removed from within the body for detection. The negative charge of the skin at buffered pH causes it to be permselective to cations such as sodium and potassium ions, allowing iontophoresis which causes electroosmosis, solvent flow towards the anode. Electroosmosis then causes electrophoresis, by which neutral molecules, including glucose, are transported across the skin. This is currently being used in such devices as the GlucoWatch, which allows for blood glucose detection across skin layers.

<doc id="684161" wikidata="Q2045740" url="?curid=684161" title="Ford Verona">
<text>The Ford Verona and Volkswagen Apollo are a pair of small family cars that were manufactured in Brazil by Autolatina, a joint venture between Brazilian subsidiaries of Ford and Volkswagen. The Verona was produced from 1989 to 1992 and from 1993 to 1996, initially as a direct replacement for the ageing Ford Del Rey.

The company spent US$100 million developing and producing the car, which is heavily based on the second generation Ford Orion, and competed mainly with the Chevrolet Monza in the local market. The first generation had the characteristic of being a two-door sedan with a unique rear end, and the only derivation of the fourth generation Ford Escort with this body style, and was also rebadged as the Volkswagen Apollo.

Autolatina ceased production of the Verona/Apollo in 1992, after only three years of the original release, but still produced locally the third generation Orion a year after and keeping the Verona nameplate, until it was replaced by the sixth generation Ford Escort saloon in 1996.

==First generation (1989–1992)==
The first generation Verona was released in November 1989, as Ford&#x27;s Brazilian subsidiary wanted a stronger competitor for the mid-size segment leader at the time, the Chevrolet Monza, despite being based from a lower segment car. It was heavily based on the second generation of the European Ford Orion, which in turn was based on the &quot;Erika&quot; third generation Ford Escort platform of 1981. Compared to the European Orion, the Verona had a unique body style, being a two-door sedan with a higher rear design and horizontal tail lights, the styling of which strongly resembled the sedan (Sapphire) version of the European Ford Sierra. The two cars are also mechanically different, and while the Orion was only available in the four-door body style, the Verona was only available with two doors. It lacked some features available in the Orion, for example the folding rear seats, to reduce production costs.

In 1986, Argentine and Brazilian subsidiaries of Volkswagen and Ford formed the Autolatina joint venture, leading to a series of badge engineered cars. The Verona was the first model to be rebranded during the alliance and its sibling was the Volkswagen Apollo, released in 1990. The alliance also allowed Ford to have access to more powerful engines, better suited to the segment it would compete, since one of the most common complaints in the Ford Del Rey it would replace was its poor performance.

Code named &quot;Nevada&quot;, the Verona development cost US$70,000,000 to Ford do Brasil, and aimed to create a competitive car for the midsize segment without excessive spending, due to the bad financial situation of the subsidiary at the time. Another US$30,000,000 were used to update the São Bernardo do Campo assembly line, where the car was produced. It was considered to build a four-door Ford Orion in Brazil, but two-door sedans were more suitable to local demand, which led to the creation of the Verona. The final name was chosen in computer, among other 21 options, including &quot;Stallion&quot;, &quot;Novara&quot; and the proper project code name &quot;Nevada&quot;.

LX and GLX were the two trim lines available for the Verona, the first one carried by a 1.6 L CHT engine and the last by a 1.8 L Volkswagen AP engine, both with ethanol and petrol variants. Base model was the LX and could be equipped with green glasses, rear window defroster, AM/FM stereo and power mirrors, while the GLX was the upscale trim level and could be equipped with fog lights, aluminum wheels, lumbar support adjustment, Bosch radio/cassette player with code to inhibit theft and power mirrors. Air conditioning and sunroof were also optional features in the GLX trim. Unlike its Apollo twin, the Verona dashboard was identical to the Ford Escort one. The last model year offered 14 pol aluminum wheels as an optional feature. That same year, the Verona was discontinued in the South American market.

In a 1989 road test conducted by a Brazilian magazine, the Verona 1.8 L managed to go from 0 to 100 km/h in 11,72 seconds and reached a maximum speed of 168.3 km/h. In this same road test, dynamometer measurements determined that ethanol engines produced 105 PS, while Ford would publicize this engine as it only produced 99 PS. This was done to avoid a higher tax on the circulation of goods (ICM) for ethanol engines for cars with power above 100 PS.

Specifications for each engine can be found in the table below.
Note: AE is an acronym for &quot;Alta Economia&quot; (High Fuel-Efficiency in English), AP stands for &quot;Alta Performance&quot; (High Performance in English).

===Volkswagen Apollo===
The Apollo was essentially a re-branded Ford Verona sold from 1990 to 1992. More expensive and marketed as a sportier model, it was only available with the 1.8 L AP engine. Compared with the Verona, it has only minor differences. These are shorter gear ratios, stiffer shock absorbers, different dashboard with orange lighting (unlike the Verona, the Apollo do not share its dashboard with the Escort), smoked tail lights very similar to the ones from the Ford Sapphire, chrome-less rear window frames, fixed-height front seats, painted mirrors (GLS trim) and airfoil. During the first model years, its front turn signals had clear lenses while the Verona had orange lenses. Trim levels were GL (base model) and GLS. A special edition named VIP was released in 1991.

A recurrent complaint from Apollo owners was the usage of steel rod-operated gear shift instead of the commonly used cable-operated gear shift. Both Verona and Apollo had cambering issues as well, partially due to rear suspension&#x27;s project that was not adequately designed for a saloon.

==Second generation (1993–1996)==
The Verona discontinued in 1992 was relaunched in late 1993, this time sharing its body style with the third generation Ford Orion and only available as a four-door sedan.

Three trims were offered, a base (LX), an intermediate (GLX) with power steering, power windows and locks and also an upscale (Ghia), the first two with the 1.8 L AP engine and the Ghia with the 2.0 L AP. The 1.6 L CHT engine was discontinued. In 1995, the 1.8 L gained electronic fuel injection, the LX version was renamed GL and the Ghia gained a new digital electronic fuel injection from FIC (standing for Ford Indústria e Comércio - &quot;Ford Industry and Trade&quot;, the brand&#x27;s division of electronic components), replacing the old analog Bosch LE Jetronic fuel injection. That same year, a new version was added to the line, the sportier 2.0i S, available with Recaro seats, air conditioning, cassette player and disc brakes in four wheels.

In 1996, the Verona was facelifted, with a new hood and the oval grille. Production also shifted from São Bernardo do Campo to Pacheco, Argentina, where it was marketed as Ford Orion. That same year, the sixth generation of the Ford Escort went on sale and the Verona nameplate was dropped and replaced by the Escort Sedan.

In a 1993 road test, the Verona went from 0-100 in 11.1 s and reached maximum velocity of 186.6 km/h. Drag coefficient was 0.31.

Specifications for engines available can be found in the table below.

==Sales==
In 1990, the Verona was the 7th best-selling car in Brazil, the Apollo was the 17th. The following year, the Verona rose to the 6th place and the Apollo to the 8th. In the last production year, they both fell to 9th and 15th positions, respectively. Total production of the Volkswagen Apollo was 53,130 units. Sales figures from both cars in Brazil are shown below.

<text>Mamaboy is a 2017 comedy film directed by Aaron Leong and written and produced by Rick Kuebler. The film stars Sean O&#x27;Donnell as a teenager who decides to undergo an experimental procedure that enables him to carry his girlfriend&#x27;s baby to term.

== Plot == 
The adolescent Kelly Hankins (Sean O&#x27;Donnell) has a good life. He is admired by his peers, the star of the baseball team, and he is in a happy relationship with the beautiful Lisa Weld (Allie DeBerry), albeit one that they have to hide from her strict father Reverend Weld (Stephen Tobolowsky). However, when Lisa tells him that she is pregnant, Kelly now has to figure out a way to keep her from getting into trouble. He thinks he has found the answer when he discovers that his Uncle Theus (J.D. Rudometkin) has managed to transfer an embryo into a male monkey&#x27;s abdominal cavity. Certain that this will solve all of their problems, Kelly persuades his uncle to do the same to him.

The process is successful and Kelly becomes pregnant. Over the course of several months, he goes through typical symptoms; hiding it from everyone with only his friend Ditto (Michael Eric Reid) aware of it. Everyone begins to notice Kelly&#x27;s odd behavior and he loses his popularity, though the flirtatious Candy (Cassidy Ann Shaffer) continues to hit on him. Lisa breaks up with Kelly as she cannot endure seeing Kelly becoming ridiculed. The nerdy Milton (Dylan Riley Snyder) begins to suspect that something is up with Kelly and reviews his findings with Principal Miller (Eric Wheeler), though he has a little trouble believing the concept of a pregnant boy.

Lisa calls Kelly in an effort to get back together with him, on the condition that the baby be transferred back to her. They get into an argument and become even more distant. Realizing that he cannot go on without Lisa, Kelly attempts to get back together with her at the prom. She seems willing to accept him back, but Milton outs the pregnancy to everyone, humiliating Kelly. Soon, the whole town learns of it with Reverend Weld attempting to demonize Kelly, but Theus manages to persuade the congregation that Kelly was fine. As graduation approaches, Kelly is unsure of what to do with himself, but his father backs him up.

The day of graduation arrives and Kelly reluctantly gives a speech to his classmates that is uplifting and empowering. He suddenly faints as he goes into labor and his friends and family rush the stage to help him. Kelly awakens in the hospital with Lisa watching over him. Kelly learns that he has given birth to twins, a boy and a girl. Lisa apologizes for her behavior and wants to raise their children together. She shows that the whole town has been rooting for Kelly&#x27;s recovery as well as her father who now approves of him.

<doc id="684166" wikidata="Q632802" url="?curid=684166" title="Chevrolet Cavalier">
<text>The Chevrolet Cavalier is a line of compact cars produced by Chevrolet. Serving as the replacement of the Chevrolet Monza, the Cavalier was the second Chevrolet model line to adopt front-wheel drive. Three versions of the Cavalier have been sold, including three generations sold in North America from model years 1982 to 2005, a version produced by SAIC-GM for China from 2016 to 2021, and a SAIC-GM version produced for Mexico since the 2019 model year.

The Cavalier was among the inaugural vehicles of the GM J platform. One of the first &quot;world cars&quot; of General Motors, the J platform was developed for use by each North American GM division (with the exception of GMC), alongside international models for Opel, Vauxhall, and Holden. Though sharing chassis underpinnings, J-body cars from Europe and Australia used slightly different body designs and different powertrains; in Europe, the Vauxhall Cavalier and Opel Ascona were marketed as mid-size cars. Initially a divisional counterpart of the Buick Skyhawk, Cadillac Cimarron, Oldsmobile Firenza, and Pontiac J2000, the Cavalier was primarily marketed alongside the Pontiac Sunbird (renamed the Pontiac Sunfire for 1995).

The 1982–2005 Cavalier was produced by multiple GM facilities across North America; all models from the 1990s on were made at Lordstown Assembly, which became synonymous with the Cavalier and compact Chevrolet modes in general from the earlier Chevrolet Vega all the way to the Chevrolet Cruze. For 2005, the Chevrolet Cobalt replaced the model line in North America.

== Predecessors ==
The Cavalier began development in the late 1970s, as Chevrolet sought to replace the compact Monza with a front-wheel drive model line sized between the Chevrolet Chevette subcompact and the front-wheel drive Nova replacement (which was renamed the Chevrolet Citation for production). Serving as a replacement for the Vega, the Monza was offered as a 2-door notchback coupe, 3-door hatchback, and 3-door station wagon (sharing the body of the Vega wagon). Initially developed for the stillborn GM Wankel rotary engine, the rear-wheel drive Monza was reengineered to accommodate V6 and V8 engines up to .

Marketed as one of the smallest and lowest-price American cars, the Chevette hatchback was closer in size to the Volkswagen Beetle, competing primarily against subcompacts from Japanese-brand manufacturers, including the Honda Civic, Datsun B210 and Toyota Corolla. Following the introduction of the Dodge Omni and Ford Fiesta, American manufacturers began transitioning towards front-wheel drive in compacts and subcompacts, through both domestically produced vehicles and the use of captive imports.

Along with developing up-to-date chassis underpinnings to replace the Monza, GM sought to expand the market appeal of the new model line by expanding the number of available body styles. The notchback coupe and three-door hatchback would make a return, joined by a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon (two body styles offered in mid-size and full-size Chevrolets).

== First generation (1982–1987) ==


The first-generation Cavalier first went on sale in the United States in May 1981 as a 1982 model. The Cavalier name originated from GM&#x27;s then-British subsidiary Vauxhall, who applied it to badge engineered variants of the Opel Ascona, the third generation of which was the first J-body car to be released.

Initially, the 1.8 liter carbureted L46 inline 4 was the only available engine, and it could be mated to either a 4-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic transmission. The Cavalier came in four body styles: a 2-door coupe, 3-door hatchback, 4-door sedan, and a 4-door station wagon. Available trim packages were the entry level Cadet, mid-level Base, and the upscale CL, which could be optioned with two-tone paint, accent stripes, and aluminum alloy wheels. The suspension was shared with the Citation and Celebrity, and consisted of MacPherson struts, lower control arms, coil springs, and a front stabilizer bar. The rear suspension was unique to the Cavalier and featured a solid beam axle, trailing arms, and variable-rate coil springs.

For 1983, the 2.0 liter throttle body fuel-injected LQ5 inline 4 replaced the previous L46 engine, and a 5-speed manual transmission was offered. A convertible model produced by American Specialty Cars was added late in the model year; initial production totaled fewer than 1,000 units. This was the first convertible from Chevrolet since the Caprice convertible had been discontinued in 1975.

For 1984, the Cavalier&#x27;s styling was lightly refreshed, with a new grille and four rather than two rectangular sealed-beam Headlamps. The Type 10 package, previously available only on the hatchback, was offered on the coupe and convertible models. 5,161 Cavaliers built at the South Gate Assembly plant were festooned with an Olympic special appearance package to celebrate the 1984 Summer Olympics.

For 1985, the 2.8 liter LB6 V6 was added as an optional engine. It was meant to debut with the Z24 package, but the Z24 package was delayed until 1986. The V6 was available as an option on all trim levels.

For 1986, the Z24 package was added as on option for the coupe and hatchback models. It featured digital gauges, sport wheels, a ground effects kit, and a specific front fascia. The Type 10 package was discontinued and replaced with the RS package, which was now available on all body styles.

For 1987, both available engines were refreshed. The LQ5 four-cylinder was updated to the LL8 designation, gained 5 horsepower, and the distributor was replaced with a coil pack ignition system. The LB6 V6 gained aluminum cylinder heads, different fuel injectors, and electronic spark control.

== Second generation (1988–1994) == 
The Cavalier was restyled in 1987 for the 1988 model year. The 3-door hatchback was dropped, while the coupe, sedan, wagon and convertible carried over. The sedan and wagon were unchanged from the doors back, while the coupe&#x27;s exterior was completely redesigned. This resulted in different trunk designs for the coupe and sedan. Three trim levels were available for 1988: VL for Value Leader, RS, and Z24. The convertible was only available as a Z24, and the dashboard unit from the Type 10 was installed in coupes and convertibles with the Z24 appearance, while the VL and RS used the dashboard unit shared with the Sunbird and Cimarron. The VL and RS came standard with the 2.0 L OHV L4 engine, now upgraded to throttle-body injection, or TBI, producing , while the 2.8 L V6 producing was optional on the RS and standard on the Z24. With two-door models, a 5-speed manual transmission was standard and a 3-speed automatic was optional, however the 3-speed automatic was made standard on sedans and wagons. An electronic dashboard was available with the RS and Z24 trims, while the front suspension carried over from the previous generation and the rear suspension adopted the torsion-beam rear axle, along with coil springs and rear stabilizer bars from the discontinued Buick Skyhawk, Oldsmobile Firenza and Cadillac Cimarron.

For 1989, the steering column was redesigned. The new self-aligning steering wheel was designed so as to reduce injuries in a collision by bending to conform to the driver&#x27;s chest. Also, rear shoulder belts became standard on all models. RS and Z24 custom cloth seating received a new style of front bucket seats with integral headrests. The optional V6 was retooled to 130 hp.

For 1990, the base engine was enlarged to a 2.2 L OHV L4, and power increased to . Door-mounted automatic front seatbelts were added due to US passive restraint legislation. The optional V6 engine was also upgraded to the 3.1 L V6 and 140 horsepower. The convertible was dropped from availability to prevent internal competition with a planned Beretta convertible. However, the Beretta convertible was shelved at the eleventh hour, before a 1990 Cavalier convertible could be prepared.

===Facelift (1991)===
The 1991 Cavalier got a more extensive restyling that involved a new hood, bumpers, headlights, taillights, wheel covers, and a redesigned interior; however, the body style remained unchanged. Most notably, the cooling system was redesigned to draw air from the bumper, giving it a Ford Taurus-style bumper and grille-less nose. The new bumpers were unpainted, with the option to have them colored grey, black or white, the latter only available on white-colored models. The RS and the Z24 eschewed this for a color-keyed body package. Z24 models also gained the options for a height-adjustable driver&#x27;s seat and a CD player. The platform and trim lines were carried over. Since the Beretta Convertible ended up not being produced, the Cavalier convertible was brought back mid-year, in RS trim only with the V6 engine standard.

Minor changes for 1991 also included the Alpha Tech ignition lock cylinder, which incorporated a dual-bit key that was larger and thicker in size in comparison to the old single-bit lock cylinder system that had been used for years. The lock system was intended to be a stronger deterrent to vehicle theft, but constant problems were reported with the lock jamming. It was dropped after an improved dual-bit single key system was introduced for the 1995 model year and redesign.

For 1992, the 2.2 L OHV standard engine adopted multi-point fuel injection, or MPFI to improve output to , however unlike the SFI version of the 2.2L in the Chevrolet Corsica. The convertible was now available in both RS and Z24 trims, with the V6 standard in the Z24 and optional with the RS. Anti-lock brakes were added as a standard feature, as Delco Moraine had managed to develop a low-cost system. Power locks were also standard, and were designed to automatically lock when the car is shifted out of park, or if the car is traveling at least 8 miles per hour in manual transmission equipped coupe models.

Model year 1993 brought minimal changes to the Cavalier line. The convertibles received a glass rear window, allowing rear window defrost as an option. Also, the RS trim received a minor styling change, doing away with its grille slot.

The 1994 models were also carryovers, as a redesign of the Cavalier was in development. Both of the wagon&#x27;s trim levels—the VL and RS—were dropped, but the body style continued to be marketed in an unnamed base trim that was essentially the same as the VL. The 2.2 L OHV L4 was now converted to the SFI version found in the Corsica, which delivered an output of 120 horsepower. Additional changes included a slightly redesigned climate control interface and the power locking system being again redesigned: the doors would still lock automatically when put into gear, but they would also unlock automatically when the ignition was switched off.

===Mexico===
The Chevrolet Cavalier was introduced in Mexico in model year 1990 to replace the Chevrolet Celebrity, which had been until then the entry point to the Mexican GM lineup. The initial offering consisted only of a 4-door sedan with a 2.8 L MPFI V6 with a 5-speed manual gearbox, or a 3-speed automatic as an option.

For 1991, it got the same redesign as in the United States and was now also offered as a coupé. The coupé Cavalier Z24 was also introduced in Mexico with a 3.1 L V6, with both manual or automatic transmissions. For 1992, the Mexican Cavalier continued unchanged.

For 1993, the Mexican Chevrolet Cavalier adopted the aesthetics from the Pontiac Sunbird. For 1993 and 1994, the Cavaliers sold there featured Sunbird body panels, as opposed to US-spec Cavalier panels and the Mexican Chevrolet Cavalier Z24 took on the appearance of the Pontiac Sunbird GT sold in the United States. No wagons and convertibles were offered in Mexico.

== Third generation (1995–2005) ==



The Cavalier received its first total redesign for 1995, with expanded dimensions and more aerodynamic styling, incorporating minor design cues from the fourth generation Chevrolet Camaro. Some of the basic styling cues remained however, such as the bumper-integrated grille and the coupes&#x27; dipped beltline. Coupe, sedan, and convertible options were offered, however the wagon model was discontinued, and later replaced with the Chevrolet HHR in 2005. The car now had the available option of 15 and 16-inch wheels. By 1997, the Cavalier became the best selling car within the entire GM lineup.

For the third generation, powertrain options were limited to inline-four engines. The option for a V6 engine, which had been available in the first and second generation, was dropped and replaced by a new four-cylinder of similar power output. Base and RS models still retained the 2.2-litre pushrod four-cylinder engine (2.2 L OHV) of the previous models, which was primarily mated to a 3-speed automatic, but was available with 5-speed manual in the two-door models, in particular the RS models. As of 1996 a new 4-speed automatic became available in any trim; this had originally been intended to be introduced along with the redesign but General Motors&#x27; cash shortage delayed it. The Z24 and LS convertible used the 2.3 L LD2 Quad 4 engine in 1995, but they received a new engine in 1996, the 2.4 liter DOHC LD9. This engine could also be special ordered on a 4-door LS model. This engine produced and of torque and was used until 2002.

In 2000, the car gained a minor facelift consisting of bigger headlights and an improved grille, lost the &quot;CHEVROLET&quot; text badge at the trunklid and gained a new &quot;CAVALIER&quot; badge along with new &quot;five spoke&quot; hubcaps. The 2.4-litre engine came mated standard with the Getrag F23 5-speed manual transmission on the Z24 models, or with the optional 4-speed automatic on both the Z24 and the LS models. The Z24 only came in 2-door coupe models until 2001 and featured a sport-tuned suspension, 16-inch tires, alloy wheels and improved interior electronics. Aesthetically little changed from the other models other than a ground effects kit and taller rear spoiler. In 2002, a 4-door Z24 Sedan debuted, featuring the same mechanics but having a less sporty body. The Z24 trim also received several other upgrades including a wider front sway bar and FE2 Sports Suspension for better handling characteristics, and less aggressive ABS anti-lock braking system.

In 2002, the 3-speed automatic was dropped from the base models equipped with the 2.2, and the 4-speed automatic became the main offering across the entire lineup, with 5-speed still available in the two-door cars. Also, the RS was replaced by the LS Sport line, which featured the new Ecotec L61 motors with and torque. These engines improved fuel economy, featuring the same displacement as the GM 122 Pushrod Engine (2.2 L OHV) while maintaining most of the power of the older LD9 motors. The new Ecotec motors replaced the GM 122 Pushrod Engine (2.2 L OHV) in base models in 2003, and became the sole engine choice in the entire Cavalier line-up until 2005 when the Chevrolet Cavalier was replaced by the Chevrolet Cobalt.

A GM Eaton M45 Supercharger kit was also offered for the Z24 trim as well. The supercharger kit was developed and tested by General Motors and could only be installed at a GM dealer. This upgrade increased performance considerably due to a pressure of 4.7 PSI which in turn added approximately and of torque increase; raising the Z24&#x27;s ratings to approximately and of torque.

===Facelifts===
The third generation Cavalier had two facelifts. There was a minor one in 1999 with new front and rear bumper fascias which included revised headlamps and taillamps for 2000 models. There was a more extensive refresh in 2002 for the 2003 model year, which included a complete new front end design, revised taillamps with a full-width rear reflector, a new rear spoiler and rear bumper fascia.

===Safety===
The third-generation Cavalier earned several low scores in crash tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Also, IIHS fatality risks statistics rated the Cavalier among the &quot;highest rates of driver deaths&quot;, with 150 (four-door) to 171 (two-door) driver deaths per million registered vehicle years. Average for the Cavalier class (small) was 103 (four-door) to 134 (two-door) driver deaths per million registered vehicle years.

The IIHS gave the 1995-2005 Cavalier a &quot;poor&quot; overall score in their frontal offset collision test.

2005 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Crash Test Ratings (coupe):

===Toyota Cavalier===

As part of a wider effort to avoid additional restrictions on exports to the US, the third generation model was briefly sold in Japan by Toyota under an agreement with GM, badged as the .

Aside from the fact that it was right hand drive, the Toyota Cavalier also featured a leather-wrapped shift knob, steering wheel and park brake lever, wider front fenders, taillights with amber turn signals for Japanese regulations, power folding side mirrors, side turn signal repeaters on the front fenders, and carpeting on the inside of the trunk lid. Interior seats were often flecked with color, and the rear seat had a fold-down armrest. Vehicles produced from February through December 1998 were available with a leather interior equipped with an automatic transmission only.

All models featured wheels borrowed from the Pontiac Sunfire. The Toyota Cavalier was available in 2.4G and 2.4Z trim levels. While all Chevrolet-badged Cavaliers received a facelift for 2000, the Toyota did as well with the updated center console, head-lights/hood/front bumper, taillights, and colors available. TRD made a body kit and rear wing for the Cavalier, available exclusively in Japan. The car was sold only at Toyota Store Japanese dealerships.

The Cavalier was not the only GM product sold in Japan; the Saturn S-series, also with right-hand-drive, was sold at Saturn dealerships (some former Isuzu dealerships) from 1996 until 2003, and some Toyota Vista Stores also retailed Saturns.

The Cavalier was entirely produced by GM in the US at the Lordstown Assembly location, and sold from 1995 to 2000. The 1996-2000 Toyota Cavaliers came equipped with the 2.4 L LD9 engine, while the 1995 used the 2.3 L Quad 4. Due to the engine displacement and width dimensions ( for the coupe, for the sedan) exceeding Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and maximum engine displacement, it was not considered a &quot;compact&quot; so it was sold as a &quot;normal-class car&quot; like the Toyota Mark II and Nissan Skyline. Prices for the coupe started at 2 million yen for the coupe, and 1.81 million yen for the sedan. the final Toyota Cavalier was imported in 2000.

The introduction of the Toyota Cavalier was not the first time the Cavalier was sold in Japan. Yanase Co., Ltd., a Japanese retail dealership that started importing European and North American vehicles soon after the end of World War II, sold various GM products including the Cavalier. When the decision was made to sell the Cavalier as a Toyota, this disrupted operations at Yanase. When the Toyota Cavalier was cancelled, Yanase continued to sell Chevrolet and other GM products. Yanase also provides complete maintenance services for all vehicles sold.

Due to higher than typically average vehicle inspection costs, a fair number of these vehicles are exported out of Japan as Japanese used cars, most notably to Australia and New Zealand. Production of the Toyota Cavalier ceased in June 2000. Despite Toyota making considerable efforts to sell the Cavalier on the domestic market, the Japanese public perceived the quality of workmanship to not be up to the standard typically expected of locally built cars. The car was also introduced while Japan was in a recession following the 1991 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble or &quot;bubble economy.&quot;

===Motorsport===

Kraft, a semi-factory supported Toyota team that competed in the All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship, raced a Toyota Cavalier in the GT300 class for the 1997 and 1998 seasons. The Cavalier GT300 car retained its front-wheel drive layout, but it was fitted with Bomex racing body and aerodynamic packages along with a 3S-GTE engine from a SW20 MR2 Turbo that was restricted to meet GT300&#x27;s 300 horsepower limit. 

Kraft debuted the Cavalier in the fourth round of the 1997 season as their second entry, accompanying the #6 Toyota MR2 (W20) that was racing full-time that year. Minoru Tanaka was signed as one of its drivers along with , one of the only seven female racing drivers in both JGTC and Super GT. The Cavalier only finished 16th in its debut at Fuji, but Tanaka and Sato brought home a fourth place finish in the next round at Mine. The results from Mine was enough for Tanaka and Sato to finish 17th in the standings. Sato was retained for the 1998 season and was joined by in the first round, Junko Mihara in the second round and Akira Watanabe for the remainder of the year. Sato and Watanabe scored three points finishes and finished 24th in that year&#x27;s championship. It was to be the Cavalier&#x27;s final year in JGTC as Kraft decided to replace it with a spaceframe Toyota AE86 for the 1999 season.

== Production ==
Most Cavaliers were built at Lordstown Assembly, although they have also been produced at South Gate Assembly (1982 model year only), Lansing Car Assembly (1995-1998 coupes), Lansing Craft Centre (1995-2000 convertibles), Janesville Assembly, Ramos Arizpe Assembly, and Leeds Assembly. The Cavalier was discontinued in 2005.

== Fourth generation (2016) ==

Chevrolet reintroduced the Cavalier name on a new compact sedan for the Chinese market, positioned below the Cruze, with the Chinese model name being Kewozi (科沃兹). The Cavalier was introduced at the 2016 Chengdu Auto Show on September 2, 2016. It uses the same Delta II platform as the first-generation Cruze, and the 1.5-liter four-cylinder engine that powers many compact GM models in China, including the Chevrolet Sail. The new Cavalier was priced between the smaller Sail and the more modern second-generation Cruze. Deliveries started in September, with almost 10,000 units sold in its first month, but there were indications the Cavalier was cannibalizing sales of the similarly-priced first-generation Cruze, which remained available. Starting in 2018, this Cavalier went on sale in Mexico, replacing the Chevrolet Sonic. There, the 1.5 L engine produces and .

The Mexico-spec Cavalier was updated for 2020, with three new paint colors, new wheel design, four airbags, ABS brakes, 3-point seatbelts and stability control, as well as minor changes to the interior for the LT trim line. These included a 7&quot; screen with Chevrolet myLink and smartphone integration for Apple CarPlay. The 2020 Cavalier went on sale on 23 September 2019. In 2019, the car was discontinued in the Chinese domestic market after being replaced by the Chevrolet Monza (科鲁泽), although it continued to be built for export. The 科沃兹 (Kewozi) name is now used on the Onix, positioned below the Monza.

== Fifth generation (2021) ==

The fifth-generation Cavalier is marketed in Mexico since in late 2021 as a 2022 model. It is a rebadged version of the Chevrolet Monza sedan produced in China. Reflecting the new engine, it is marketed as the Cavalier Turbo. The engine is a 1,298 cc inline-four producing and .

<text>Columbia College is the oldest undergraduate college of Columbia University, a private Ivy League research university in New York City. Situated on the university&#x27;s main campus in Morningside Heights in the borough of Manhattan, it was founded by the Church of England in 1754 as King&#x27;s College by royal charter of King George II of Great Britain. It is Columbia University&#x27;s traditional undergraduate program, offering BA degrees, and is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.

Columbia College is distinctive for its comprehensive Core Curriculum and is among the most selective of American colleges, with an admission rate of 3.85% in 2024.

== History ==
Columbia College was founded as King&#x27;s College in 1754 in the Province of New York by royal charter from King George II of Great Britain. Owing in part to the influence of the Church of England, a site was chosen for the new college within the churchyard of Trinity Church on Broadway opposite Wall Street in New York City. The college remained at this site for less than a decade.

The college chose Samuel Johnson to be its first president. He was also the college&#x27;s first (and for a time only) professor. During this period, classes and examinations, both oral and written, were conducted entirely in Latin.

=== Park Place Campus ===
By 1760, Columbia had relocated from the Trinity Church site to one along Park Place, near the city commons and today&#x27;s New York City Hall.

In 1767, Samuel Bard established a medical college at the school, now known as the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, which was the first medical school to grant the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in America.

Due to the American Revolutionary War, instruction was suspended from 1776 until 1784, but by the beginning of the war, the college had already educated some of the nation&#x27;s foremost political leaders, such as Alexander Hamilton, who served as military aide to General George Washington, initiated and authored most of &quot;The Federalist Papers&quot;, and served as the first Secretary of the Treasury; John Jay, author of several of the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot; and the first Chief Justice of the United States; Robert Livingston, one of the Committee of Five who drafted the Declaration of Independence; and Gouverneur Morris, one of the Committee of Detail who finished the last draft of the United States Constitution.

Hamilton&#x27;s first experience with the military came while a student during the summer of 1775, after the outbreak of fighting at Boston. Along with Nicholas Fish, Robert Troup, and a group of other students from King&#x27;s College, he joined a volunteer militia company called the &quot;Hearts of Oak&quot; and achieved the rank of Lieutenant. They adopted distinctive uniforms, complete with the words &quot;Liberty or Death&quot; on their hatbands, and drilled under the watchful eye of a former British officer in the graveyard of the nearby St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel. In August 1775, while under fire from HMS &quot;Asia&quot;, the Hearts of Oak (the &quot;Corsicans&quot;) participated in a successful raid to seize cannon from the Battery, becoming an artillery unit thereafter. Ironically, in 1776 Captain Hamilton would engage in the Battle of Harlem Heights, which took place on and around the site that would later become home to his alma mater more than a century later, only to be entombed after his dueling death some years later at the original home of King&#x27;s College in Trinity Church yard.
With the successful Treaty of Paris in 1783, the domestic situation was stable enough for the college to resume classes in 1784. With the new nation&#x27;s independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, the name of the institution was changed from King&#x27;s College to Columbia College, the name by which the institution continues to be known today. The college was briefly chartered as a state institution, lasting only until 1787, when due to a lack of public financial support the school was permitted to incorporate under a private board of trustees. This 1787 charter remains in effect. The renamed and reorganized college, located in the new national capital under the Constitution and free from its association with the Church of England, received students from a variety of denominations as a response to its growing reputation as one of the finest institutions of higher learning in the new nation.

=== Midtown Campus ===
Columbia was located at its Park Place campus near New York City Hall for nearly a century, from approximately 1760 to 1857, at which point the college moved to 49th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan.

During the college&#x27;s forty years at this third location, in addition to granting the Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Medicine degrees, the faculties of the college were expanded to include the Columbia Law School (founded 1858), the Columbia School of Mines (founded 1864, now known as the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science). The Columbia School of Mines awarded the first Ph.D. from Columbia in 1875.

At this time, Columbia College was now not only the name of the original undergraduate college founded as King&#x27;s College, but it also encompassed all of the other colleges and schools of the institution. (Though technically known as the &quot;School of Arts&quot;, the undergraduate division was often called &quot;The College &quot;proper&quot;&quot; to avoid confusion.) After Seth Low became president of Columbia College in 1890, he advocated the division of the individual schools and colleges into their own semi-autonomous entities under the central administration of the university. The complexity of managing the institution had been further increased when Barnard College for Women became affiliated with Columbia in 1889 followed by Teachers College of Columbia University in 1891. Also by this time, graduate faculties issuing the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in philosophy, political science, and the natural sciences had also developed.

 Thus, in 1896, the trustees of Columbia College, under the guidance of Seth Low, approved a new name for the university as a whole, Columbia University in the City of New York. At this point, the name Columbia College returned to being used solely to refer to the original undergraduate college, founded as King&#x27;s College in 1754 and renamed Columbia College in 1784.

=== Move to Morningside Heights ===
In addition to reclaiming the identity of Columbia College and making it the focus of the newly rearranged Columbia University, Low was also responsible for the monumental relocation of the university to its current location atop a hill in Morningside Heights in uptown Manhattan. A tract for the campus was purchased, which extended from 114th St. to 120th St. between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue.

Charles McKim of McKim, Mead, and White was selected to design the new campus, which was to be patterned after the buildings of the Italian Renaissance. While most American universities at this point had followed more medieval and Gothic styles of architecture, the neoclassical style of the new Columbia University campus was meant to reflect the institution&#x27;s roots in the Enlightenment and the spirit of intellectual discovery of the period. Columbia College and Columbia University as a whole relocated to the new campus in 1897.

The academic history of traditions of Columbia College clearly had their beginnings in the classical education of the Enlightenment, and in this mold, the college&#x27;s famous Core Curriculum was officially recognized and codified in 1919 with John Erskine&#x27;s first seminar on the great books of the western tradition. Also in 1919, a course, War and Peace, was required of all Columbia College students in addition to the Great Books Honors Seminar.

During the 1960s, Columbia College, like many others across the United States, experienced unrest and turmoil due to the ongoing civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War. On April 23, 1968, more than 1,000 students forcefully occupied five campus buildings in protest to the proposed expansion of the university&#x27;s campus into Morningside Park and to protest the university&#x27;s sponsorship of classified military research. University officials wished to build new gymnasium facilities in the park, which, while located directly adjacent to the university, is separated by a steep cliff. Plans to create separate entrances for students and local residents was the primary objection of the student protesters to the proposed expansion plan. A fence at the site was torn down, and police arrested one student, whose release became one of the demands of the protest. After five days, the functions of the university were brought to a halt, and early on the morning of April 30 the students were forcibly removed by the New York City Police Department. As a result of the student protests, the university president Grayson L. Kirk retired, classified research projects on campus were abruptly ended, long-standing ROTC programs were expelled, and the proposed expansion plans were canceled. The university experienced financial difficulties throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, and admissions standards in the college slightly relaxed to hasten the diversification of the student body following the 1968 protests. Paralleling a national trend after 1970, Columbia classes in the 1970s and 1980s, earned lower SAT scores than did Columbia students in the late 1960s. The scores were, however, similar to other Ivy schools except Harvard, Yale, and Princeton—a position not acceptable to Columbia&#x27;s ambitious administration.

After two committees reported in 1980 and 1981 that the all-male college&#x27;s competitiveness with other Ivy League universities was decreasing, women were admitted in 1983. The median SAT score of the class of 1991 was the highest since the early 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the college experienced a drastic increase in gifts and endowment growth, propelling it from the periphery to the forefront of a university historically dominated by its graduate &amp; professional schools. During the leadership of university presidents Michael Sovern and George Erik Rupp, many of Columbia College&#x27;s facilities were extensively expanded and renovated. The number of residence halls was increased to accommodate all Columbia College students for all four years of the undergraduate education. Hamilton Hall, the primary academic building of Columbia College has undergone extensive renovations, and the college&#x27;s athletic facilities, located at Baker Field Athletics Complex on Manhattan&#x27;s far northern tip at 218th Street, were renovated and expanded.

===Admissions===
Like other elite schools, Columbia has been attracting ever higher numbers of applicants, with a trend towards applicants applying to more than seven different institutionsan increasingly &quot;scattershot approach&quot; when compared to applications in the 1990s. Columbia College (including Columbia Engineering) has an admittance rate that places it among the most selective of American colleges. For the fall term of 2010, there were 26,178 applicants for 2,397 placements in the Class of 2014, for an acceptance rate of . By the fall term of 2024, applications had more than doubled, with 60,248 applicants for 2,319 placements in the Class of 2028, for an acceptance rate of .

=== Academics ===
Columbia College has long been known for its rigorous Core Curriculum, a series of mandatory classes and distribution requirements that form the heart of Columbia College students&#x27; academic experience.

Students are also required to pass a swimming test before receiving their diploma. The foreign language requirement, however, may be skipped if the student passes a placement exam or demonstrates requisite proficiency. Most students graduate within four years with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

=== Campus ===
Most of the college&#x27;s facilities are located on Columbia University&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus, especially in Hamilton Hall, which houses its administrative and admissions offices, as well as the directors of the Core Curriculum.

Butler Library, Columbia University&#x27;s main library, is home to more than 2 million volumes of the university&#x27;s humanities collection. The facility recently underwent an extensive four-year renovation, including the creation of a new wing, named Philip L. Milstein Family College Library in honor of its donor. Included is a specialized collection of approximately 100,000 volumes containing subject matter in history, literature, philosophy, and the social sciences specifically intended to complement the Columbia College curriculum. The collection of the Columbia University Libraries consists of more than 9.2 million volumes held in 25 specialized libraries as well as a digital library, however Columbia College students do not have unlimited access to all specialized libraries.

Students at Columbia College are guaranteed campus housing for four years. Residence halls, which also house undergraduate students of Columbia&#x27;s engineering school, are either located on the Morningside Heights main campus or within 10 blocks of the 116th Street entrance. First-year students are housed on the main quad in John Jay, Carman, Wallach, Hartley and Furnald Halls.

The two main dining facilities are John Jay Dining Hall and Ferris Booth Commons; all freshmen are required to have a full meal plan. Other school dining facilities available on the Morningside Heights campus are located in the recently remodeled student center, Alfred Lerner Hall, Faculty House, and Uris Hall.

=== Governance ===

In 2011, after the resignation of Michele Moody-Adams, James Valentini replaced her as Dean of Columbia College. The students of Columbia College elect the Columbia College Student Council (CCSC) to serve as their primary representative, advocate, and liaison to the Columbia University community, including its administration, faculty, alumni and students, as well as to the public.

The college&#x27;s board of visitors is an independent and self-governing advisory body composed of college alumni and parents. The board advocates for the interest of the college among the Columbia community, New York city and beyond. It also provides advice to the dean in identifying and addressing both immediate challenges and short-and long-term opportunities for the college. Members of the board currently include ZhenFund CEO Anna Fang, JP Morgan Chase global head of research Joyce Chang, Virtu Financial CEO Doug Cifu, Academy Award-winning producer Dede Gardner, former NYC Commissioner for Consumer and Worker Protection Peter Hatch, USRowing Chairman and president Nobuhisa Ishizuka, HEICO co-president Eric Mendelson, Sixth Street Partners co-founder Vijay Mohan, Warner Bros. General Counsel John Rogovin, Morgan Stanley&#x27;s global head of technology Robert Rooney, HNA Group CEO Tan Xiangdong, former FTC Commissioner Mozelle W. Thompson, Happy Family CEO Shazi Visram, and hedge fund manager William von Mueffling.

Former members of the board count among them PBS president Lawrence K. Grossman, Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer, hedge fund manager Mark E. Kingdon, Bain Capital co-managing partner Jonathan Lavine, Univision CFO Frank Lopez-Balboa, airline investor Frank Lorenzo, real estate developer Philip L. Milstein, H.I.G.

==History==
In 1835, Miloš Obrenović invited J.G. Herder offspring August to the Bor region to carry out geological investigations.

Đorđe Vajfert invested in exploration and sought foreign capital to initiate industrial exploitation. Managing to obtain support for this endeavour, he signed a contract with Mirabaud, and his Compagnie française des mines de Bor was established on 30 September 1903 in Paris.

On 27 March 1941, Nazi Germany invaded Yugoslavia. &quot;Führer’s directive No. 25&quot; mentioned that possession of the Bor copper mines were very important, which covered 50 percent of the copper requirement of Nazi Germany&#x27;s war industry until 1944. Since 1941 to 1944, Hungarian forced laborers of Jewish origin were gradually deported 
to this area, at least 6,000 Hungarians were used as Kapos. In May 1943, the total number of inmates (excluding Kapos) came to about 23,000 forced laborers from Serbia.

On 3 September 1944, a column of about 3,000 Kapos left the camp under supreme command of Horthy task forces and marched over a pontoon bridge between Smederovo and Požarevac to Baja via Pančevo. Hungarian forces were supported by regional paramilitary operation echelon &quot;Deutsche Mannschaft&quot; including &quot;Banater Staatswache&quot; unit.

On 16 September, a second column of 3,000 Kapos left the camp under supreme command of SS-Polizei-Gebirgsjäger-Regiment Nr. 18 on the same route to Baja. In Pančevo, supreme command had been taken over by paramilitary operation echelon &quot;Deutsche Mannschaft&quot; and Volksdeutsche Ordnungspolizei. During both marches, exhausted prisoners were murdered by the roadside.

In Baja arrived, prisoners were either used to build the German South-east wall or transported by train to concentration camps such as Auschwitz.

Some Danube Swabian officials including family members also took the opportunity to escape by train from Baja. During both forced marches, there were several attacks carried out by Yugoslavian Partisans south of Danube river. Meanwhile, some prisoners took the opportunity to flee to the partisans and thus found life-saving protection. Notable Kapos from both death marches were people like Gyula Trebitsch, and Miklós Radnóti.

In 1947, Bor received urban status from the political authorities. At the time its population was 11,000.

== Healthcare ==
Healthcare in Bor, a city in Serbia, faces unique challenges associated with significant air pollution resulting from mining activities. The city&#x27;s industrial landscape, dominated by mining operations, has led to environmental concerns and, consequently, health issues for its residents.

Historical Context: The roots of healthcare in Bor trace back to the early 20th century when the city faced the impact of air pollution due to mining activities. Recognizing the pressing need for specialized medical care, the first healthcare institution in the city was established as a hospital for respiratory diseases in the 1930s. Over time, this hospital evolved into a general hospital, adapting to the changing healthcare needs of the community.

General Hospital&#x27;s Evolution: Originally established to address respiratory diseases resulting from air pollution, the General Hospital in Bor has played a crucial role in adapting to the evolving health landscape. From its origins as a hospital for pulmonary diseases, it has expanded its services to cover a wide range of medical specialties, becoming a cornerstone in providing comprehensive healthcare to the community.

Air Pollution Challenges and Protest Dynamics: The city of Bor has witnessed a surge in protests fueled by the alarming levels of air pollution. The public outcry, coupled with extensive media coverage, reflects the urgency of addressing environmental issues. Residents, concerned about their well-being, have taken to the streets to demand immediate action and accountability from both industrial entities and the local government.

Health Impact and Cancer Rates: According to a report from the Institute of Public Health &quot;Milan Jovanovic Batut&quot; of Serbia, a staggering 25 percent of the population is reported to be grappling with some form of cancer. These concerning statistics underscore the severe health consequences of prolonged exposure to high levels of air pollution. The pressing need for comprehensive healthcare interventions and preventative measures is evident in the face of these alarming figures.

Lack of Government Action: Despite the widespread protests and escalating health concerns, there is a perceived lack of decisive action on the part of the local government. The absence of robust measures to curb pollution and address the health crisis has fuelled frustration within the community, intensifying the call for urgent and effective intervention.

Healthcare in Bor remains entwined with the ongoing struggle against air pollution. The city&#x27;s healthcare institutions continue to adapt, emphasizing the critical interplay between environmental factors, public health, and the imperative for swift, collaborative solutions.

<text>Microsoft Query is a visual method of creating database queries using examples based on a text string, the name of a document or a list of documents. The QBE system converts the user input into a formal database query using Structured Query Language (SQL) on the backend, allowing the user to perform powerful searches without having to explicitly compose them in SQL, and without even needing to know SQL. It is derived from Moshé M. Zloof&#x27;s original Query by Example (QBE) implemented in the mid-1970s at IBM&#x27;s Research Centre in Yorktown, New York.

In the context of Microsoft Access, QBE is used for introducing students to database querying, and as a user-friendly database management system for small businesses.

Microsoft Excel allows results of QBE queries to be embedded in spreadsheets.

<text>The bar-winged flycatcher-shrike (Hemipus picatus) is a small passerine bird usually placed in the Vangidae. It is found in the forests of tropical southern Asia from the Himalayas and hills of southern India to Indonesia. Mainly insectivorous it is found hunting in the mid-canopy of forests, often joining mixed-species foraging flocks. They perch upright and have a distinctive pattern of black and white, males being more shiny black than the females. In some populations the colour of the back is brownish while others have a dark wash on the underside.

==Description==
The bar-winged flycatcher-shrike is black capped with black wings that contrast with the white of the body. A white slash across the wing and a white rump stand out in contrast. They sit upright on branches, flying around to glean insects. The nostril is hidden by hairs and the upper mandible of the beak has a curved tip. Males are velvety black while females tend to be greyish brown but the pattern varies across the geographic populations. Both males and females of the Himalayan &quot;H. p. capitalis&quot; have a brown back but the males have a black head. The Sri Lankan population &quot;leggei&quot; lacks sexual dimorphism in plumage. &quot;H. p. intermedius&quot; has only the females with a brownish back. The tail is black but the outer tail feathers are white while the non-central tail feathers are tipped with white.

The call is a rapid and high &#x27; or a &#x27; and sometimes a sharp &quot;chip&quot;. Male-female pairs of the subspecies &quot;leggei&quot; of Sri Lanka have been reported to duet with precision.

Young birds are said to have a broken pattern of white and grey giving the appearance of lichens.

The exact systematic family position is unclear but the genus &quot;Hemipus&quot; has been found to be closely related to the genus &quot;Tephrodornis&quot; and show affinities to the Malaconotidae of Africa.

==Distribution==

The nominate race is found mainly in the Western Ghats of India but becoming very rare towards the Surat Dangs. They are also found in some parts of central and eastern India, extending into Bangladesh. The subspecies &quot;capitalis&quot; is found along the Himalayas from Simla, east to Manipur and Chittagong in India and extending into northern Thailand, Myanmar and Laos.

Subspecies &quot;leggei&quot; of Sri Lanka (southern Western Ghats populations included in older works) has the sexes indistinguishable. It is found in the hill forests of Sri Lanka.

Subspecies &quot;intermedius&quot; is found in Southeast Asia in Sumatra, Borneo, and parts of the Malay Peninsula. The brownish grey wash on the breast of females is darker, contrasting with the white of the abdomens. The back is darker brown than in other subspecies. The males also have darker breasts.

Other subspecies that have been described such as Walter Koelz&#x27;s &quot;pileatus&quot; (described from the Lushai Hills) and &quot;insulae&quot; (from Sri Lanka) are not considered valid.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This bird catches insects by gleaning foliage and making aerial sallies for flushed insects. It will associate with other small birds such as babblers, velvet-fronted nuthatch and white-eyes in feeding flocks. They move through the forest and rarely stick to a particular location.

The nesting season in Sri Lanka is mainly from February to August, March to May in India. The nest is a neat cup with rim held stiff by cobwebs binding it and the inside is lined with fine grass and fibre. Lichens cover the surface of the nest cup which is placed on the horizontal surface of a dry branch, often close to the tip of a dead branch or on a leafless tree making it appear like a knot in the wood. The usual clutch is 2 or 3 eggs which are pale greenish white and blotched with black and grey. The bird sitting at the nest appears as if it is casually perched. Both males and females incubate. The chicks at nest stay still with eyes closed and face the center of the nest while holding their bills high giving the appearance of a broken branch.

They have been said to be sensitive to forest degradation but some studies note that they are less sensitive and capable of persisting even in considerably disturbed forests.

<text>A drum (also called a barrel) is a cylindrical shipping container used for shipping bulk cargo. Drums can be made of steel, dense paperboard (commonly called a fiber drum), or plastic, and are generally used for the transportation and storage of liquids and powders. Drums are often stackable, and have dimensions designed for efficient warehouse and logistics use. This type of packaging is frequently certified for transporting dangerous goods. Proper shipment requires the drum to comply with all applicable regulations.

Steel drums are ubiquitous industrial shipping containers. They are manufactured from sheets of cold rolled steel formed into a tube and welded along the side seam. Stainless steel, nickel, and special alloys are occasionally used. The bottom head is permanently attached by the manufacturer. Two primary options are available for the top head:
* Open head drum, removable head drum: Top head is attached after filling with a closing ring and bolted lock. Liquids, granular solids and waste are commonly shipped in these. 
* Tight head drum, closed head drum, non-removable head drum: The top head is permanently attached by the manufacturer. It is usually made with one or two threaded access fittings, closed by threaded bungs after filling. Liquids are suited to these drums. 

===History===

Henry Wehrhahn, employee of Nellie Bly&#x27;s Iron Clad Manufacturing Company of New York, received two patents in December 1905 that would lead to the modern 55-gallon steel drum Use of 200-litre drums became widespread in World War II, the first war in which trucks, cold rolled steel, stamp or pattern forging machinery and welding were widely available. They were first utilized by the Axis powers (Germany and Italy), but were quickly adopted by Allies. The drums helped win the Guadalcanal Campaign in the first U.S. offensive in the South Pacific Theater. The U.S. Navy could not maintain command of the sea long enough to offload aviation gasoline for aircraft ashore, so the drums were often transported to the island on fast ships, such as destroyers, and shoved over the sides (or, time permitting, lowered in cargo nets). Because gasoline&#x27;s density is much less than that of water, the drums floated. Navy Seabees in small craft corralled the drums.

===Constructions===

A wide variety of constructions and sizes are available. When the intended use is for shipment of dangerous goods (hazardous materials), strict regulatory requirements are applicable. Coordinated by the UN, countries and regional authorities require drum construction and the demonstrated performance of severe testing. The Industrial Steel Drum Institute has also provided guidance for conducting the tests. Drums have embossed symbols to identify certification for shipment of certain types of products. 

Many drums nominally measure just under tall with a diameter just under , and have a common nominal volume of whereas the barrel volume of crude oil is . In the United States, drums are also in common use and have the same height. This allows easy stacking of mixed pallets. Barrels can be constructed of plastic, laminated paperboard or steel.

Drums have top and (usually) bottom &quot;chimes&quot; or rims: sometimes called &quot;chines&quot;. Most steel drums have reinforcing &quot;rolling hoops&quot; or rings of thickened metal or plastic. This sufficiently strengthens them so that they can readily be turned on their sides and rolled when filled with heavy materials, like liquids. Over short to medium distances, drums can be tipped and rolled on the bottom rim while being held at an angle, balanced, and rotated with a two-handed top grip that also supplies the torque (rotational or rolling force).

The open-top sub-type is sealed by a mechanical ring clamp (concave inwards) that exerts sufficient pressure to hold many non-volatile liquids and make an airtight seal against a gasket, as it exerts force inward and downward when tightened by a normal three-quarter inch wrench or ratchet wrench. Tops exist with bung holes as above, and these hybrid drums with lid can be used to ship many non-volatile liquids as well as industrial powders. Many drums are used to ship and store powdered products as well as liquids, such as plastic beads for injection moulding, extrusion, and purified industrial grade powders like cleansers (e.g., fertilizers, and powdered aluminum). If used to transport dangerous goods across international boundaries, they may need to have UN certification. In general, drum usage is limited to wholesale distribution of bulk products, which are then further processed or sub-divided in a factory.

These metal drums have two openings with flanges, often NPS and NPS in diameter. Once the drums are filled, the plugs (bungs) are screwed in the flanges using pneumatic or hand-operated bung tightener (plug wrench). To secure the contents of the drums against theft and adulteration during shipment, cap-seals made of metal and other types like metal-plastic laminates are used. These cap-seals sit on top of the flanges and are crimped, using a drum cap-seal crimping tool, also called a drum cap sealer. Once cap-seals are crimped, the plugs can be unscrewed only by breaking these cap-seals. Pneumatic and hand-operated cap-seal crimping tools are available. Pneumatic ones are used in production lines for high production.

===International standard size===
A 200-litre drum (known as a 55-gallon drum in the United States and a 44-gallon drum in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world) is a cylindrical container with a nominal capacity of 200 litres (55 US or 44 imp gal). The exact capacity varies by manufacturer, purpose, or other factors. Standard drums have inside dimensions of diameter and height. These dimensions yield a volume of about , but they are commonly filled to about 200 litres.

The outside dimensions of a 200-litre drum are typically diameter at the top or bottom rim, diameter at the chines (ridges around drum), and height. Exact dimensions are specified in ANSI MH2.

The drums are typically made of steel with a ribbed outer wall to improve rigidity and for rolling. The lids can be welded or secured with a head gasket and bolt ring. They are commonly used for transporting oils, fuels, chemicals, and dry goods. 

Drums are frequently transported on pallets for ease of handling by a fork truck and for shipping. The drum&#x27;s size, shape, and weight distribution lends itself to being moved about readily on the loading dock or factory floor with a two-wheeled hand truck. They can be turned on side and rolled. They can also be moved by hand short distances on firm surfaces by tilting and then rolling along the base, or by using a drum handler, which is designed especially for that purpose.

Closed-head steel barrels and drums used for shipment of chemicals and petroleum products have a standardised bunghole arrangement, with one (DN50) NPT and one (DN20) NPT threaded bunghole on opposite sides of the top head. Drums can also be made of durable plastic or paperboard and this arrangement is echoed in many plastic drums. Various components can be mounted to the drum, such as drum pumps and bung mixers.

In the past, hazardous waste was often placed in drums of this size and stored in open fields or buried. Over time, some drums would corrode and leak. As a result, these drums have become iconic of pollution problems, even though they have numerous uses and are ubiquitous in commerce. Tests have shown that a leaking 55-gallon drum can disperse its contents over a 1,200 square-foot area of level surface. Drums are often cleaned or re-conditioned and then used for storing or shipping various liquids or materials.

Although crude oil is sometimes shipped in 55-US-gallon drums, the measurement standard of oil in barrels is based on the whiskey containers of the 1870s that measured . The measure of 42 US or wine gallons corresponds to a wine tierce (third-pipe). A wine barrel, or tun, measures .

Applicable standards include:
* ISO 15750-1:2002. Packaging — Steel drums — Part 1: Removable head (open head) drums with a minimum total capacity of 208 L, 210 L, and 216.5 L
* ISO 15750-2:2002. Packaging — Steel drums — Part 2: Non-removable head (tight head) drums with a minimum total capacity of 212 L, 216.5 L, and 230 L
* ISO 15750-3:2022. Packaging — Steel drums — Part 3: Inserted flange-type closure systems

===Reconditioning===

Steel drums are commonly reconditioned for further use. Life cycle studies of reconditioning and reuse have been quite favorable. 
 Clean drums go to a qualified reconditioner: hazardous residue can be a concern to regulators. Reconditioning usually consists of inspection, removal of labels, cleaning (mechanical, heat, or caustic cleaner), straightening of dents and chimes, replace gaskets, painting, testing, marking and labeling. Steel drums can often go through many use - reconditioning - reuse cycles before they are recycled or landfilled.

==Fibre drums==

Fibre drums (occasionally: fiber drums) are shipping containers with paperboard : laminated paperboard; plastics, foils, and other protective layers. The heads can be of fibreboard, metal, plywood, plastic or other suitable material. Drums typically have a circular cross section but square drums are also available: these can be packed closer during shipment and storage. 

Fibre drums are available in a variety of constructions and sizes. They are used for shipping various granular materials, coiled wire and cable, long Fluorescent light bulbs, and (when certified) for dangerous goods. Compatibility with the contents is important; drum liners are commonly used. 

Steel, fibre, and plastic covers are available with steel lever lock ring closures.
==Plastic Drums==

Plastic drums are typically made of blow molded high density polyethylene. They are available in a variety of sizes and constructions designed for specific purposes and markets. Plastic drums are used for liquids, granular solids, and inner packages. When designed, tested, and labeled, plastic drums can be used with dangerous goods or hazardous materials. 
The plastic drum, inner coating, or drum liner should be compatible with the intended contents. Foods and pharmaceuticals can be particularly sensitive. Some liquid chemicals can permeate through plastics or can cause embrittlement. 

The compression stability of plastic drums can be sensitive to heat. The Plastic Drum Institute does not recommend stacking when temperatures are above about . Some methods of reinforcing the sidewalls are available. 
Plastic drums are used for more than shipping containers. They can be used for water collection and storage. Also, plastic drums are used along highways to mark construction zones.

Applicable standards include:
* ISO 20848-2:2006. Packaging — Plastics drums — Part 1. Removable head (open head) drums with a nominal capacity of 113,6 l to 220 l
* ISO 20848-2:2006. Packaging — Plastics drums — Part 2: Non-removable head (tight head) drums with a nominal capacity of 208,2 l and 220 l
* ISO 20848-3:2018. Packaging — Plastics drums — Part 3: Plug bung closure systems for plastics drums with a nominal capacity of 113,6 l to 220 l

<doc id="684207" wikidata="Q1072483" url="?curid=684207" title="Helicoid">
<text>The helicoid, also known as helical surface, is a smooth surface embedded in three-dimensional space. It is the surface traced by an infinite line that is simultaneously being rotated and lifted along its fixed axis of rotation. It is the third minimal surface to be known, after the plane and the catenoid.

==Description==
It was described by Euler in 1774 and by Jean Baptiste Meusnier in 1776. Its name derives from its similarity to the helix: for every point on the helicoid, there is a helix contained in the helicoid which passes through that point.

The helicoid is also a ruled surface (and a right conoid), meaning that it is a trace of a line. Alternatively, for any point on the surface, there is a line on the surface passing through it. Indeed, Catalan proved in 1842 that the helicoid and the plane were the only ruled minimal surfaces. 

A helicoid is also a translation surface in the sense of differential geometry.

The helicoid and the catenoid are parts of a family of helicoid-catenoid minimal surfaces.

The helicoid is shaped like Archimedes screw, but extends infinitely in all directions. It can be described by the following parametric equations in Cartesian coordinates:
:formula_1
:formula_2
:formula_3
where and range from negative infinity to positive infinity, while is a constant. If is positive, then the helicoid is right-handed as shown in the figure; if negative then left-handed.

The helicoid has principal curvatures formula_4. The sum of these quantities gives the mean curvature (zero since the helicoid is a minimal surface) and the product gives the Gaussian curvature.

The helicoid is homeomorphic to the plane formula_5. To see this, let decrease continuously from its given value down to zero. Each intermediate value of will describe a different helicoid, until is reached and the helicoid becomes a vertical plane.

Conversely, a plane can be turned into a helicoid by choosing a line, or &quot;axis&quot;, on the plane, then twisting the plane around that axis.

If a helicoid of radius revolves by an angle of around its axis while rising by a height , the area of the surface is given by

:formula_6

==Helicoid and catenoid==

The helicoid and the catenoid are locally isometric surfaces; see Catenoid#Helicoid transformation.

<text>The Staten Island Advance is a daily newspaper published in Staten Island, one of the five boroughs of New York City. It is the only daily newspaper published in Staten Island and the only major daily newspaper focused on covering it exclusively. &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; covers news of local and community interest, including Staten Island politics. &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; is the namesake and nominal flagship publication of Advance Publications.

As of April 25, 2007, the newspaper&#x27;s weekday circulation was down 3.9% from 2006, to 59,461, and its Sunday circulation dropped 4.6% from 2006, to 73,203.

==History==
===19th century===

The &quot;Advance&quot; was founded in 1886 by printer John J. Crawford and businessman James C. Kennedy and initially known as the &quot;Richmond County Advance&quot;. The name was later changed to the &quot;Daily Advance&quot; and then to its current name. When &quot;The Advance&quot; was founded in 1886, there were nine competing daily newspapers in Staten Island. The circulation of The &quot;Advance&quot; quickly surpassed these early competitors, growing from 4,500 in 1910 to over 80,000 by the mid-1990s.

===20th century===
In 1908, Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr. began working as an office assistant to Hyman Lazarus, an attorney, owner of the &quot;Bayonne Times&quot;, and a leader of New Jersey&#x27;s Democratic Party machine. By 1916, when Newhouse was 21, Lazarus rewarded him with a salary of around $30,000 per year, and 25 percent ownership of the &quot;Bayonne Times&quot;, for loyal service.

In 1922, Newhouse and Lazarus purchased the &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; in one of the first in a series of newspapers Lazarus acquired. When Lazarus died in 1924, Newhouse bought his family&#x27;s share of &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; stock.

Throughout the 1920s, the Newhouse family loaned money to Henry Garfinkle, which enabled him to open newsstands that increased sales of the newspaper at St. George Ferry Terminal on Staten Island, and later opened newsstands throughout Manhattan and at LaGuardia Airport in Queens, Newark Airport in Newark, New Jersey, and Port Authority Bus Terminal; the newsstand at Port Authority was, at the time, the world&#x27;s largest and most lucrative newsstand.

Even during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the Newhouse family had enough money to buy the &quot;Long Island Press&quot; in Jamaica, Queens and several of its competitors, including the &quot;Long Island Star&quot;, &quot;North Shore Journal&quot;, &quot;Nassau Journal&quot;, &quot;Newark Ledger&quot;, the &quot;Newark Star&quot;, and newspapers in Syracuse, New York. Throughout the 1930s, the Newhouse family paid its non-unionized newsroom employees at the &quot;Long Island Press&quot; a third less than the unionized employees at &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. Newhouse, in turn, paid himself a salary greater than the total of all the salaries paid to the 65 &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; newsroom employees combined.

Throughout the 1940s, the Newhouse family continued aggressively acquiring purchasing newspapers in Syracuse, Jersey City, New Jersey, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In the 1950s, they acquired newspapers in St. Louis, Oregon, and Alabama. The Newhouse family&#x27;s wealth approached $200 million in the late 1950s, enabling it to purchase &quot;Vogue&quot; and other Conde Nast magazines. Author Richard Meeker describes the mounting suspicions about the Newhouse family&#x27;s source of wealth in &quot;Newspaperman: S.I. Newhouse and the Business Of News&quot;:

Newspaper analysts were so suspicious of the source of Newhouse&#x27;s funds that they discussed openly the possibility that he was laundering money...Some went so far as to suggest that his newspaper operations had been used as a front for the notorious Reinfeld mob, a group of booze-peddling hoodlums whose boss had made millions during prohibition.

One way the Newhouse family was able to accumulate so much money so rapidly was by hiring accountants and lawyers who figured out unique ways for the Newhouse dynasty to avoid paying taxes. As &quot;Newspaperman&quot; reported:

&quot;They played every tax game there was&quot;, recalled one man who once served as publisher for several Newhouse newspapers. That meant that every cost that could conceivably be written off as a business deduction was, that assets were depreciated as rapidly as possible, and that new acquisitions were &quot;written up&quot; as high as the law allowed ... Where Newhouse developed a special advantage was in the way he avoided paying taxes for the profits that remained to him after the payment of corporate taxes ...Thanks to an ingenious device created by his accountant, Louis Glickman, and implemented by his attorney, Charles Goldman, Newhouse was able to avoid paying taxes on accumulated earnings and, thus, to multiply the value of his earnings several times. Doing so involved the creation of a special corporate structure for the various newspapers ... Because the Goldman–Glickman construct kept the various enterprises separate—for tax purposes at least—each could claim the right to its own surplus. Taken together, the accumulation that resulted was many times what the IRS would have allowed had Newhouse simply treated all of his operations as a single corporation.

Meeker characterized the Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation as &quot;a charity his Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.&#x27;s lawyers had created as an additional tax dodge&quot;, and charged that Newhouse Foundation funds were used by the Newhouse family to finance its $18 million purchase of Alabama&#x27;s &quot;Birmingham News&quot; in 1955.

After Newhouse died in 1979, his two sons, Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr. and Donald Newhouse, were accused of tax evasion by the IRS in 1983. While the IRS dropped tax fraud charges against them in the 1980s, it increased the Newhouse family tax delinquency bill to $1.2 billion, asserting that the Newhouse estate was actually worth $2.2 billion, not $1.2 billion when Samuel Newhouse Sr. died in 1979, according to the March 13, 1989, issue of &quot;The Nation&quot;.

One year after Newhouse&#x27;s death in 1979, the Advance Group purchased Random House, and then sold it to Bertelsmann eleven years later, in 1998.

The original &quot;Staten Island Advance&quot; office was located on Castleton Avenue in the West Brighton neighborhood of Staten Island. In 1960, the paper moved to its current office on West Fingerboard Road in the Grasmere neighborhood of Staten Island. For many years, the &quot;Advance&quot; was listed as the nominal headquarters for the Newhouse chain; it did not have a formal headquarters until moving to One World Trade Center in the 2020s.

<doc id="684210" wikidata="Q1318998" url="?curid=684210" title="Mean curvature">
<text>In mathematics, the mean curvature formula_1 of a surface formula_2 is an &quot;extrinsic&quot; measure of curvature that comes from differential geometry and that locally describes the curvature of an embedded surface in some ambient space such as Euclidean space.

The concept was used by Sophie Germain in her work on elasticity theory. Jean Baptiste Marie Meusnier used it in 1776, in his studies of minimal surfaces. It is important in the analysis of minimal surfaces, which have mean curvature zero, and in the analysis of physical interfaces between fluids (such as soap films) which, for example, have constant mean curvature in static flows, by the Young–Laplace equation.

==Definition==
Let formula_3 be a point on the surface formula_4 inside the three dimensional Euclidean space . Each plane through formula_3 containing the normal line to formula_4 cuts formula_4 in a (plane) curve. Fixing a choice of unit normal gives a signed curvature to that curve. As the plane is rotated by an angle formula_8 (always containing the normal line) that curvature can vary. The maximal curvature formula_9 and minimal curvature formula_10 are known as the &quot;principal curvatures&quot; of formula_4.

The mean curvature at formula_12 is then the average of the signed curvature over all angles formula_8:
:formula_14.

By applying Euler&#x27;s theorem, this is equal to the average of the principal curvatures :
:formula_15

More generally , for a hypersurface formula_16 the mean curvature is given as 
:formula_17

More abstractly, the mean curvature is the trace of the second fundamental form divided by &quot;n&quot; (or equivalently, the shape operator).

Additionally, the mean curvature formula_1 may be written in terms of the covariant derivative formula_19 as 
:formula_20
using the &quot;Gauss-Weingarten relations,&quot; where formula_21 is a smoothly embedded hypersurface, formula_22 a unit normal vector, and formula_23 the metric tensor.

A surface is a minimal surface if and only if the mean curvature is zero. Furthermore, a surface which evolves under the mean curvature of the surface formula_2, is said to obey a heat-type equation called the mean curvature flow equation.

The sphere is the only embedded surface of constant positive mean curvature without boundary or singularities. However, the result is not true when the condition &quot;embedded surface&quot; is weakened to &quot;immersed surface&quot;.

===Surfaces in 3D space===
For a surface defined in 3D space, the mean curvature is related to a unit normal of the surface:
:formula_25
where the normal chosen affects the sign of the curvature. The sign of the curvature depends on the choice of normal: the curvature is positive if the surface curves &quot;towards&quot; the normal. The formula above holds for surfaces in 3D space defined in any manner, as long as the divergence of the unit normal may be calculated. Mean Curvature may also be calculated
:formula_26
where I and II denote first and second quadratic form matrices, respectively.

If formula_27 is a parametrization of the surface and formula_28 are two linearly independent vectors in parameter space then the mean curvature can be written in terms of the first and second fundamental forms as
formula_29
where formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, formula_35.

For the special case of a surface defined as a function of two coordinates, e.g. formula_36, and using the upward pointing normal the (doubled) mean curvature expression is

:formula_37

In particular at a point where formula_38, the mean curvature is half the trace of the Hessian matrix of formula_4.

If the surface is additionally known to be axisymmetric with formula_40,

:formula_41

where formula_42 comes from the derivative of formula_43.

===Implicit form of mean curvature===
The mean curvature of a surface specified by an equation formula_44 can be calculated by using the gradient formula_45 and the Hessian matrix
:formula_46
The mean curvature is given by:

:formula_47

Another form is as the divergence of the unit normal. A unit normal is given by formula_48 and the mean curvature is 
:formula_49

==In fluid mechanics==
An alternate definition is occasionally used in fluid mechanics to avoid factors of two:
:formula_50.

This results in the pressure according to the Young–Laplace equation inside an equilibrium spherical droplet being surface tension times formula_51; the two curvatures are equal to the reciprocal of the droplet&#x27;s radius 
:formula_52.

==Minimal surfaces==
A minimal surface is a surface which has zero mean curvature at all points. Classic examples include the catenoid, helicoid and Enneper surface. Recent discoveries include Costa&#x27;s minimal surface and the Gyroid.

===CMC surfaces===

An extension of the idea of a minimal surface are surfaces of constant mean curvature. The surfaces of unit constant mean curvature in hyperbolic space are called Bryant surfaces.

<text>Ameridelphia is traditionally a superorder that includes all marsupials living in the Americas except for the monito del monte (&quot;Dromiciops&quot;). It is now regarded as a paraphyletic group.

==Orders==
The orders within this group are listed below:

* Order Didelphimorphia (108 species)
** Family Didelphidae: opossums
* Order Paucituberculata (7 species)
**Family Caenolestidae: shrew opossums

==Evolution and phylogenetics==

Modern marsupials are now understood to be an originally South American lineage that later reached Australia and diversified there in a massive adaptive radiation. Molecular data, including analysis of retrotransposon insertion sites in the nuclear DNA of a variety of marsupials, and the fossil evidence indicate that Ameridelphia might best be understood as an evolutionary grade. Since Didelphimorphia appears to be the basal marsupial group, it and Paucituberculata do not seem to be closest relatives. Meanwhile, the unranked clade Euaustralidelphia has been proposed as the name for the Australian marsupials (Australidelphia minus Microbiotheria, of which &quot;Dromiciops&quot; is the only survivor), which in all probability derive from a single colonization out of South America via Antarctica.

<doc id="684219" wikidata="Q843411" url="?curid=684219" title="Nihoa">
<text>Nihoa (; or ), also known as Bird Island or Moku Manu, is the tallest of ten islands and atolls in the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). The island is located at the southern end of the NWHI chain, southeast of Necker Island. Nihoa is the closest NWHI in proximity to the eight main windward Hawaiian Islands at approximately northwest of the island of Kauai. The island has two peaks, Miller&#x27;s Peak in the west, and Tanager Peak in the east. Nihoa&#x27;s area is about and is surrounded by a coral reef. Its jagged outline gives the island its name, , which is Hawaiian for &quot;toothed, serrated&quot;.

The island is home to 25 species of plants and several animals, making it the most diverse island in the entire NWHI. Endemic birds like the Nihoa finch and Nihoa millerbird, and endemic plants like &quot;Pritchardia remota&quot; and &quot;Schiedea verticillata&quot; are found only on Nihoa. &quot;Amaranthus brownii&quot; was considered the rarest plant on Nihoa and has not been directly observed on the island since 1983, and is now considered to be extinct. The plant communities and rocky outcrops provide nesting and perching areas for 18 species of seabirds, such as red-footed boobies and brown noddies, terns, shearwaters, and petrels. Prehistoric evidence indicates Native Hawaiians lived on or visited the island around AD 1000, but over time the location of Nihoa was mostly forgotten, with only an oral legend preserving its name. Captain James Colnett rediscovered the island in 1788, and Queen Kaʻahumanu visited it in 1822. It was made part of the Kingdom of Hawaii by King Kamehameha IV.

In 1909, Nihoa became part of the Hawaiian Islands Reservation, a federal wildlife refuge established by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The Tanager Expedition surveyed the island in 1923, taking a comprehensive biological inventory of its many species. In 1940, it became part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Wildlife Refuge and in 1988, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places due to its culturally significant archaeological sites. In 2006, it became part of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. Efforts are underway to ensure that endangered plant species are propagated beyond their limited range and represented in &quot;ex situ&quot; collections. Persons intending to visit Nihoa for cultural and scientific research purposes require a USFWS-issued special-use permit to land on the island so as to reduce the risk of introducing alien species to Nihoa&#x27;s already fragile ecosystem.

==Geology and geography==

Nihoa is part of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain of volcanic islands, atolls, and seamounts starting from the island of Hawaii in the southeast to the Aleutian Islands in the northwest. It is the youngest of ten islands in the uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), having formed 7.2 million years ago; the oldest, Kure Atoll, formed 30 million years ago. Over the millennia, Nihoa has experienced significant erosion; along with Necker, French Frigate Shoals, and Gardner Pinnacles, Nihoa is one of only four islands in the NWHI that still has an exposed basalt rock substrate. Six valleys slant down from north to south, meeting at the south side of the island: West Valley, West Palm Valley, Miller Valley, Middle Valley, East Palm Valley, and East Valley.

The valleys slant towards Adam&#x27;s Bay on the south side, which also has a sea cave.

Among features on Nihoa are Dog&#x27;s Head Peak (), named for its likeness, and Pinnacle Peak (), a volcanic dike created when less resilient rock was eroded away and harder rock was open to the elements. The only flat area on the island is Albatross Plateau, just below Miller&#x27;s Peak. The Devil&#x27;s Slide is a narrow cleft descending irrespective of the surrounding elevation. Extending northward from Albatross Plateau, it ends at the vertical cliffs with a drop straight down to the ocean below. In this chasm, rare ferns grow, along with several endemic species, including a giant cricket.

The island is about 1371 meters long going from east to west, and 274–914 meters wide. The overall shape is that of a half saddle, with one side having sheer cliffs and the other sloping towards the ocean.

==Ecology==

Nihoa&#x27;s inaccessibility and lack of major guano deposits made the island unattractive to humans, helping to preserve its endemic species from extinction. Because of Nihoa&#x27;s small size, most of its endemic organisms are endangered, as one single disaster, such as an island-wide fire or an introduction of invasive species, could wipe out the whole population. One such invasive species is the gray bird grasshopper, &quot;Schistocerca nitens&quot;; from the period between 1999 and 2003, grasshoppers devastated much of the vegetation on the island and posed a real threat to the continued health of plants on Nihoa. The following year, the numbers decreased and the vegetation became lush again. The grasshoppers probably came to Nihoa by way of wind from Kauai.

The north side of the island&#x27;s cliffs are mostly bare, but the sloping valleys are covered with a variety of grasses and shrubs. The two most common grasses on these slopes are &quot;Eragrosis Varabilis&quot; and &quot;Panicum torridum&quot;.

There is also a variety of scrubs and bushes on the island slopes, such as &quot;Chenopodium sandwicheum&quot; and ilima bushes (&quot;Sida fallax&quot;). 

Unique species include:

* &quot;Pritchardia remota&quot; fan palm, the only tree on the island
* Nihoa millerbird
* Nihoa finch
* Nihoa conehead katydid
* Nihoa carnation
* &quot;Sesbania tomentosa&quot;
* the amaranth &quot;Amaranthus brownii&quot;
* the trapdoor spider &quot;Nihoa mahina&quot;
* &quot;Thaumatogryllus conanti&quot;, a giant cricket found in the Devil&#x27;s Slide area
* &quot;Plagithmysus nihoae&quot;, a longhorned beetle
* &quot;Eupelmus nihoaensis&quot;, a wasp
* &quot;Hylaeus perkinsianus,&quot; Perkin&#x27;s yellow-faced bee

===Important Bird Area===

The island forms part of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because of its seabirds and endemic landbirds.

==Ancient history==
Nihoa was well known to the early Hawaiians. Archaeological expeditions found extensive prehistoric agricultural terraces and house sites. At least one site has been dated to around the 1st millennium AD, sometime between 867 and 1037. There is some doubt as to the number of people that lived on Nihoa, because while the large terraces suggest a considerable number, there is scant fresh water to be found. Archaeologists Kenneth Emory and Paul Cleghorn estimate that water could support as many as 100 people, although if the island were previously forested, this would have increased fresh water supplies relative to its current state. Because of the island&#x27;s importance, the island was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988, and subsequently became part of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument in June 2006.

Nihoa, along with Necker Island to the northwest, is among the most northern, isolated, smallest and driest of the high volcanic Hawaiian islands, and receives the lowest dust and tephra input. All of these features were found to strongly predict deforestation among the Pacific Islands. The abandonment of Nihoa may be tied to deforestation although this has not been proven and small groves of trees were noted in the major drainage valleys during survey work conducted in 1928.

Artifacts recorded on the island represent a unique material culture demonstrating restraint in the utilization of wood. A number of artifact types such as bowls and human figures called &quot;ki&#x27;i&quot; that elsewhere in the Hawaiian chain would have been made out of wood were instead carved from stone, a lengthy and labor-intensive process. Archaeological sites on the island are similar to other site types within the Hawaiian islands and include both packed dirt and stone terraces likely for habitation and agricultural uses on the steep slopes of the island, cave shelters, and heiau. Some scholars consider Nihoa to be a matched pair with Necker Island although the latter appears not to have had a permanent population.

The heiau on Nihoa and Necker Islands are unique in the Hawaiian chain representing a raised pavement of basalt stones with upright stones placed across this pavement often near the edges as opposed to the form common to other islands in the chain represented by a high stacked stone wall enclosing a central space. This difference in form represents an earlier iteration of Hawaiian monumental architecture that offers a unique perspective on cultural norms prior to the abandonment of Nihoa. Thanks to this difference in form, scholars often use the term &#x27;marae&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;heiau&#x27; in reference to these structures and some scholars argue that the shift in form represents a shift in ritual practice in Hawaii.

==Early exploration==

The first Westerner to discover Nihoa was Captain James Colnett of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, on March 21, 1788. Due to Colnett&#x27;s lengthy absence from England, including his imprisonment by the Spanish for his part in the Nootka Sound Incident, the discovery was once widely accredited to Captain William Douglas of the &quot;Iphigenia&quot;, who sighted Nihoa almost a year later.

The abandoned settlements seen by the early explorers caused Nihoa and Necker islands, to be called the &#x27;mystery islands&#x27;. However, this term is used more generally to refer to any island in the Pacific that was similarly abandoned prior to European contact.

By the end of the 18th century, Nihoa had been forgotten by most Hawaiians. In 1822, Queen Kaahumanu and her husband King Kaumualii traveled with Captain William Sumner to find Nihoa, as her generation had only known the island through songs and myths. Later, King Kamehameha IV sailed there to officially annex the island as part of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Finally, in 1885, Princess Liliuokalani made a pilgrimage to Nihoa with her escorts, but their luncheon was cut short when one of the party ignited a wildfire by accident. The group tried to flee the island, but the rising tides made it difficult and several boats were flooded, destroying some of the photographs taken. On this visit a carved basalt bowl was found and taken back to the main islands by the Queen.

In 1859 the position of Nihoa island was determined by the survey schooner, USS &quot;Fenimore Cooper&quot;.

==Tanager expedition==

During 1923-4 the Tanager expedition was a noted scientific exploration of Nihoa island. This resulted in various biological and archeological discoveries.
The Tanager expedition conducted the first archeological survey of the island. Evidence of an ancient settlement on Nihoa was discovered, along with platforms, terraces, and human remains.

Noted events include finding a specimen of &quot;Amaranthus brownii&quot; and the discovery of the Nihoa millerbird which was formally named &quot;Acrocephalus familiaris kingi&quot;,

On this expedition, several hundred Loulu fan palms were counted on the island. Twenty other flowering plants were also noted at this time.

Examples of exploration work:
*Survey map of island
*Bird life
*Plants
*Insects
*Marine life
*Geology

On the Tanager expedition they also found the remnants of a modern fishing camp in a cave near the landing, with some leftover coats and bags of rice.

<text>New Brighton is a neighborhood located on the North Shore of Staten Island in New York City. The neighborhood comprises an older industrial and residential harbor front area along the Kill Van Kull west of St. George. New Brighton is bounded by Kill Van Kull on the north, Jersey Street on the east, Brighton and Castleton Avenues to the south, and Lafayette Avenue and Snug Harbor Cultural Center to the west. It is adjacent to St. George to the east, Tompkinsville to the south, and West New Brighton to the west.

The village of New Brighton was incorporated in 1866 out of six wards of the town of Castleton. It originally stretched four miles (6.4 km) long and was two miles (3.2 km) wide, encompassing the entire northeast tip of the island from Tompkinsville to Snug Harbor, and included what is now St. George. The current neighborhood includes Hamilton Park, an enclave of Victorian homes built before the American Civil War. The surrounding area includes several older churches such as St. Peter&#x27;s Church, the oldest Roman Catholic church on Staten Island. The original New Brighton Village Hall, constructed in 1871 on present Fillmore Street, was demolished in 2004. New Brighton public housing includes the Cassidy-Laffayette Houses and the Richmond Terrace Houses on Jersey Street.

New Brighton is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Codes are 10304 and 10301. New Brighton is patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

== History ==
=== Precolonial and colonial period ===
Originally, Staten Island was inhabited by the Munsee-speaking Lenape Native Americans. The Lenape relocated during different seasons, moving toward the shore to fish during the summers, and moving inland to hunt and grow crops during the fall and winter. The present-day area of New York City was inhabited in 1624 by Dutch settlers as part of New Netherland. In 1664, the Dutch gave New Netherland to the British, and six years later the British finalized a purchase agreement with the Lenape.

At the time of British handover, several British, Dutch, and French settlers occupied the area, but did not have an established title to the land. A series of surveys were conducted through 1677, and several parcels were distributed to different landowners. Among them were the &quot;Duxbury Glebe&quot;, given to Ellis Duxbury in 1708, bequeathed to the Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Andrew&#x27;s ten years later, and then leased for 54 years by John Bard in 1765. Another tract was granted to Lambert Jansen Dorlant in 1680, whose western boundary was a brook on present-day Jersey Street. By 1748 it had been purchased by Salmon Comes, who ran a ferry to Manhattan. By 1765, part of the Dorlant tract was owned by John Wandel, a molasses distiller who operated a plant at the Kill Van Kull near Richmond Terrace and Westervelt Avenue, taking advantage of the Jersey Street brook. Two Native American roads intersected near the distiller: Shore Road (today&#x27;s Richmond Terrace) on the North Shore, and a road that winded southward on St. Marks Place and then Hamilton and Westervelt Avenues.

Fort Hill, one of the hills overlooking the harbor, was the location on Duxbury&#x27;s Point or Ducksberry Point, fortified by the British during the American Revolutionary War. Hessian troops, contracted by the British, were stationed near the Jersey Street brook, which then became known as Hessian Springs. After the end of the war, the area remained primarily rural through the early 19th century. The area became part of the town of Castleton upon the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1788.

=== 19th century ===
==== Early ownership ====
Among the first people to promote the widespread development of Staten Island was former U.S. vice president Daniel D. Tompkins, who purchased land in the northern part of Staten Island in the early 1810s. Tompkins purchased Abraham Crocheron&#x27;s farm, located on present-day Jersey Street south of Richmond Terrace, in 1814. The next year, he acquired from St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, and two years after that, he bought Philip Van Buskirk&#x27;s land claim, located between the two disconnected pieces of land. Tompkins also incorporated the Richmond Turnpike Company to build present-day Victory Boulevard in 1816, started operating a ferry to Manhattan in 1817, and laid out the adjacent village of Tompkinsville for development between 1819 and 1821. Tompkins then expanded the Van Buskirks&#x27; old farmhouse, using it as his primary residence. He died in 1825.

Tompkins&#x27;s property on the North Shore was sold in April 1834 to Manhattan developer Thomas E. Davis, who continued to buy land through the following year. Davis came to own all the land on Staten Island&#x27;s northeastern shore, bounded to the south by Victory Boulevard, to the west by Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor, and to the north and east by the waterfront. He planned to develop the area into a summer retreat called New Brighton, renaming Shore Road to Richmond Terrace, and the first five Greek Revival summer bungalows were erected in 1835. Davis sold the development to a five-person syndicate for $600,000 in 1836, and the New Brighton Association was incorporated that April. The area on the northeast shore thus came to be called New Brighton.

==== Increasing development ====
Development on the New Brighton street grid proceeded according to a plan that surveyor James Lyons had created in 1835. Streets were arranged around existing topography. When the New Brighton Association laid out streets in northeastern Staten Island, many of these roads were named after notable politicians, with such names as Hamilton Avenue, Jay Street, and Madison Street. Other streets were named after people or places that were associated with the development of the area, including Tompkins, Davis, or the Stuyvesant family (who were early investors). For instance, St. Marks Place was named after Davis&#x27;s developments on St. Marks Place in Manhattan, while Westervelt Avenue was named after Tompkins&#x27;s son-in-law. Several of these street names replaced preexisting appellations.

Work on the street grid and development of the land continued, but in March 1837, one major investor declared bankruptcy following the Panic of 1837. The same year, the Pavilion Hotel opened in a mansion along the shore, being converted from a residence. The association continued to lay out streets. However, in 1840, four of the five original New Brighton Association investors&#x27; properties were foreclosed upon. The foreclosed lots were thus repurchased by Thomas E. Davis in 1844. According to a survey conducted the following year, several streets had been laid out in New Brighton, including Carroll Place, Hamilton Avenue, St. Marks Place, Richmond Terrace, and numerous smaller streets. Most development was on the waterfront, where there were mansions with carriage buildings, as well as smaller homes and the Pavilion Hotel. St. Peter&#x27;s Church on Carroll Street, dedicated in 1844, was the island&#x27;s first Roman Catholic house of worship; it remains one of Staten Island&#x27;s most historically important churches, with more than half of the island&#x27;s Catholic churches having been derived from St. Peter&#x27;s parish. Two Greek Revival houses remain on the waterfront, at 404 and 272 Richmond Terrace.

By the 1840s and 1850s, New Brighton including modern-day St. George began to develop into a summer resort area. In addition to the existing Pavilion, hotels in modern-day St. George/New Brighton included the Peteler (later St. Marks) Hotel, as well as the Belmont Hotel. Additionally, new houses such as Italianate villas were built, while existing Richmond Terrace mansions were expanded or received new annexes and gardens. Several greenhouses were also built in the neighborhood, particularly on the land of the merchant John C. Green, whose estate is now the site of Curtis High School. The silk printer John Crabtree established a printing plant for his company, Crabtree and Wilkinson, on the eastern bank of the Jersey Street brook in 1844. The factory had over 180 workers and a small residential and commercial community by 1853, and the establishment of similar factories led to the population of New Brighton doubling between 1840 and 1860.

In 1861, the onset of the American Civil War resulted in large changes to the neighborhood&#x27;s land use. Initially, the local economy suffered due to cessation of trade with the Southern United States, but because of the Union Army&#x27;s demand for material, many entrepreneurs and workers moved to New York City, including to Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore. According to a 1865 article from the &quot;Richmond County Gazette&quot;, &quot;the demand for dwelling houses upon the island has never before been equalled.&quot; During this time, many new houses were designed in the Second Empire style and/or as duplexes, particularly on as-yet-undeveloped plots along Westervelt Avenue or St. Marks Place. The end of the Civil War, cheaper building materials, and technological improvements resulted in an increase in real estate prices on the North Shore, and by the early 1870s, the area was described as being prosperous, with real estate in high demand.

==== Late 19th century ====
The New Brighton Village Hall was built in 1871 and was one of the few Village Halls to remain from the old village system that existed before it was merged with New York City. A passage from an anonymous author in the &quot;Illustrated Sketch Book of Staten Island, NY: Its industries and commerce&quot;, from 1886, describes New Brighton as follows:The village of New Brighton is unique in its attractiveness. Its public buildings, churches, hotels and institutions are all handsome and substantial, its residences the perfection of refined taste; it has fifteen miles (24 km) of streets, the principal of which are wide, well paved, and generally well shaded with ornamental trees. A complete system of sewerage has been adopted. The inhabitants are filled with a sense of local pride which is in itself most commendable and leads to the happiest results, the most noticeable of which perhaps is the great care bestowed upon their private residences. The neighbors seem to vie with each other in friendly emulation as to who shall keep the smoothest lawn, the neatest fence or the most graceful fountain.

As a whole, the effect is most pleasing, but when the eye wanders beyond the artificial beauty of its immediate surroundings and rests upon the sparkling waters of the incomparable Bay of New York, with stretches of cultivated landscape in the distance, the picture is singularly lovely and complete.

The Panic of 1873 resulted in a near-cessation of building activity on the North Shore. By the late 1870s, industries had started to move to the area again, such as J. B. King and Company, whose plaster mill opened in 1877. A water system was established upon the Staten Island Water Supply Company&#x27;s 1879 incorporation, and a sewage system was added between 1884 and 1890. In the 1880s, the area closest to the ferry terminals on the northeastern shore became known as &quot;St. George&quot;, after developer George Law, who acquired rights to the New Brighton waterfront at bargain prices. According to island historians Charles Leng and William T. Davis, the businessman Erastus Wiman, who was expanding the Staten Island Railway to New Brighton, promised to &quot;canonize&quot; Law if the latter agreed to relinquish the land rights for a new railroad–ferry terminal there. The St. George Terminal opened in early 1886, bringing more development to the neighborhood.

The completion of new transportation options also resulted in further real estate development, especially around the areas close to New Brighton and St. George stations. Developers such as John M. Pendleton and Anson Phelps Stokes constructed cottages and houses in the northern part of St. George, while existing property owners expanded their properties. Many newer houses, meanwhile, were designed in the Queen Anne, Shingle, and Colonial Revival styles. Although Staten Island as a whole remained largely residential and less densely populated and developed than the surrounding region, the inhabitants of the region favored consolidation with the greater metropolis. In 1898, Staten Island was consolidated with New York City, and this move accelerated development of the region. At this time immigrant groups settled in New Brighton in greater numbers; Italians and African-Americans along the Kill Van Kull, and Jewish communities on the eastern boundary of the village near St. George and Tompkinsville.

=== 20th century ===
In the years after unification, the North Shore became quickly urbanized, and the political and economic center of Staten Island shifted to the region. The area&#x27;s first secondary school, Curtis High School, opened in 1904. The ferry service to Whitehall Terminal was transferred to municipal operation the following year. Other city services were also brought to Staten Island following unification, such as schools, emergency facilities, new roads, and utilities including an underground water supply. Neighboring St. George became the civic center of Staten Island, with a new Staten Island Borough Hall built in 1906 and the Richmond County Courthouse in 1919. This provided the impetus for improvements in infrastructure, including road construction, police and fire protection, and two commuter airports on Staten Island that were established in the 20th century. Navy and Coast Guard outposts could be found on the north shore of Staten Island, each employing local residents in military and civilian capacities.

Staten Island and New Brighton thrived economically. Larger manufacturers employed many local residents; Procter &amp; Gamble, US Gypsum, and several other factories provided jobs for thousands of residents. The Procter &amp; Gamble factory, opened in October 1907, operated for more than 80 years. At the end of the 1920s, some of the borough&#x27;s first apartment buildings and four-family dwellings were concentrated in New Brighton. One such apartment building collapsed in a storm in 1937, killing nineteen people.

The 1964 opening of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, connecting Brooklyn and Staten Island, allowed for a massive population and development boom that continues to this day. This, combined with the closing of many area factories, the construction of housing projects along Richmond Terrace and the surrounding area, and an increase in area poverty, caused large changes to New Brighton.

==Demographics==

For census purposes, the New York City government classifies New Brighton as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George was 33,551, a change of 1,397 (4.2%) from the 32,154 counted in 2000.

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 33.7% (11,303) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 1, which comprises New Brighton and other neighborhoods on the North Shore, had 181,484 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.0 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 24% are between the ages of between 0–17, 27% between 25 and 44, and 26% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 13% respectively.

==Attractions==
One Pendleton Place, the Christ Church New Brighton (Episcopal), Hamilton Park Community Houses, and Neville House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

=== Snug Harbor ===

Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor was built in 1833 by a wealthy New Yorker named Robert Richard Randall. Designed as a place for retired sailors, Snug Harbor was the first establishment of its kind in the United States. The park-like setting is located on the North Shore of Staten Island along the Kill Van Kull. Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor includes 26 Greek Revival, Beaux Arts, Italianate and Victorian style buildings. At its peak, 1,000 sailors made their home at Snug Harbor, but due to a decline in funding caused by the founding of the Social Security program, the site closed in the 1960s.

The site is considered Staten Island&#x27;s &quot;crown jewel&quot; and &quot;an incomparable remnant of New York&#x27;s 19th-century seafaring past.&quot; It is a National Historic Landmark District and is also designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The site is now called Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Gardens and has gardens, museums, theaters, educational spaces, and special events.

=== St. Peter&#x27;s Church ===
The first weekly Mass of St. Peter&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was held in 1839 in a gun factory in New Brighton. The New Brighton Association later donated land for the church, which opened in 1844 near its current location on St. Mark&#x27;s Place. After a fire destroyed the original church in the 1890s, George Edward Harding &amp; Gooch designed a new church building that was completed in 1903. The interior of the church has influence from the French-Gothic style, visible in its vaulted ceilings that are curved and end in a point at the top. It be seen from almost anywhere in New Brighton, and one that stands out while approaching from the Staten Island Ferry.

=== W.S. Pendleton Houses ===
The W.S. Pendleton Houses at 1 &amp; 22 Pendleton Place are designated landmarks of New York City, and 1 Pendleton Place was additionally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Both houses were once owned by W.S. Pendleton, a prominent local businessman who worked in real estate and owned a local ferry boat company. Pendleton, born in New York City in 1795, later became a pioneer lithographer in Boston.

Built in 1861, 1 Pendleton Place was designed by Charles Duggin in the Stick style. 22 Pendleton Place, a Gothic Revival style house built in 1855, possesses a distinctive individuality, with its square, spire-topped tower, steeply pitched gables, pendant scrollwork, asymmetrically placed dormers, bay windows and oriel window.

=== Atlantic Salt Company ===

The Atlantic Salt Co. purchased its current location in 1976, a gypsum corporation plant owned and used the property. The Atlantic Salt Co. is family-run and operated by the Mahoney family; the first generation, headed by founder and former president Leo Mahoney, started the business in 1955.

=== Hamilton Park subsection ===
Hamilton Park (sometimes known as Cottage Hill), laid out circa 1851-52 was probably the earliest suburban residential park on Staten Island and one of the first self-contained, limited access suburban subdivisions in the United States. Unconnected to the grid of surrounding streets until 1886, it is a large, elevated tract bounded by today&#x27;s East Buchanan, Franklin, Prospect and York. Traces of the original carriage roads which wound through the wooded terrain are still visible. Hamilton Park is an old tight-knit community nestled in a sea of developments and low income housing projects. It sits on top of a hill known as &quot;Brighton Heights&quot; and ranks with Todt Hill as one of the highest points on the eastern seaboard below Maine.

The hilly streets of the Hamilton Park neighborhood feature rows of gingerbread-trimmed Victorian mansions and shingle-style homes erected during the Civil War era. A number of suburban country dwellings of 12 to 14 rooms, originally dubbed as &quot;cottages&quot;, survive. 66 Harvard Avenue, also known as the C.K. Hamilton House, was built c.1853 as part of Hamilton Park Community Houses and is believed to be the first speculatively built &quot;cottage&quot; and is the only intact survivor of Hamilton Park&#x27;s original suburban residences. Among German architect Carl Pfeiffer&#x27;s first American commissions in the early 1860s were 12 houses built for Hamilton, many of which survive today. Although somewhat simpler and less picturesque than the earlier Harvard Avenue house, the brick, Italianate &quot;cottage&quot; at 105 Franklin Avenue boasts a magnificent arcaded loggia.

<text>Australidelphia is a superorder of marsupials encompassing about three-quarters of all living marsupial species, including all those native to Australasia and one South American species, the monito del monte. Unlike other American marsupials, which belong to the Ameridelphia, Australidelphia’s lineage emerged in South America, with genetic evidence (retrotransposon insertion sites) showing the monito del monte as its most ancient branch. 

The Australian members form a distinct group (clade) within this superorder, tentatively named Euaustralidelphia (&quot;true Australidelphia&quot;), though their internal relationships (branching order) is yet to be determined. Studies suggest Australidelphia originated in South America alongside other major marsupial groups, likely dispersing to Australia via Antarctica in a single event after the monito’s lineage (Microbiotheria) diverged, leaving other South American orders (Didelphimorphia and Paucituberculata) as more basal.

==Phylogeny==

<doc id="684248" wikidata="Q696607" url="?curid=684248" title="Battle of the Denmark Strait">
<text>The Battle of the Denmark Strait was a naval engagement in the Second World War, which took place on 24 May 1941 between ships of the Royal Navy and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The British battleship and the battlecruiser fought the German battleship and the heavy cruiser , which were attempting to break out into the North Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping (Operation Rheinübung) through the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland.

Less than 10 minutes after the British opened fire, a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot; struck &quot;Hood&quot; near her aft ammunition magazines. Soon afterwards, &quot;Hood&quot; exploded and sank within three minutes, with the loss of all but three of her crew. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; continued to exchange fire with &quot;Bismarck&quot; but suffered serious malfunctions in her main armament. The British battleship had only been completed in late March 1941, and used new quadruple gun turrets that were unreliable. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; soon broke off the engagement.

The battle was a tactical victory for the Germans, but its impact was short-lived. The damage done to &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s forward fuel tanks forced the abandonment of the breakout and an attempt to escape to dry dock facilities in occupied France, producing an operational victory for the British. Incensed by the loss of &quot;Hood&quot;, a large British force pursued &quot;Bismarck&quot;, resulting in her loss three days later.

==Background==
===German plans===
In April 1941, the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; intended to send the recently completed fast battleship into the Atlantic Ocean to raid the convoys carrying supplies from North America to Britain. The operation was intended to complement the U-boat attacks on British supply lines during the Battle of the Atlantic. The two fast battleships and had just completed a similar operation, code-named Berlin, between January and March that year. The number of major warships available to the Germans was limited; &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sister ship was not yet operational, &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; was in need of a boiler overhaul after Operation Berlin, and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; had been damaged by air attacks early April while in Brest, France. Work on the heavy cruisers and , both under refit in Germany after their own raiding operations, was delayed by British air attacks that struck supply depots in Kiel. Admiral Günther Lütjens, the fleet commander who was to command German forces during the planned Operation Rheinübung, sought to delay until repairs to &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; were completed or &quot;Tirpitz&quot; could join &quot;Bismarck&quot;, but the &quot;Oberkommando der Marine&quot; (Naval High Command) instructed Lütjens to begin the operation as soon as possible to keep pressure on Britain&#x27;s supply lines. As a result, the only vessel available to support &quot;Bismarck&quot; was the heavy cruiser .

===British plans===
The British Royal Navy learned of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s sortie after the Swedish cruiser spotted the vessels passing through the western Baltic Sea on 20 May; &quot;Gotland&quot;″s report was passed to the British naval attache in Stockholm, who forwarded it to the Admiralty. British reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the Germans&#x27; presence in Norway. Now aware that major German warships were at sea with the intention to break into the Atlantic, the Royal Navy began to despatch vessels to patrol the likely routes, including the heavy cruisers and to cover the Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland. Another group, consisting of the battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the battlecruiser , and a screen of six destroyers, , , , , and , under the command of Vice-Admiral Lancelot Holland in &quot;Hood&quot;, cruised to the south of Iceland to intercept the Germans once they were detected. &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; spotted &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; on the evening of 23 May; &quot;Suffolk&quot; was fitted with radar that allowed them to shadow the Germans through the night whilst remaining outside of German gun range.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was a newly commissioned , similar to &quot;Bismarck&quot; in size and power. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had not yet been properly &quot;shaken down&quot;, and her crew was inexperienced. She still had mechanical problems, especially with her main armament. The ship had sailed with shipyard workers still aboard working on her.

For 20 years after her commissioning in 1920, &quot;Hood&quot; was the largest and heaviest warship in the world. Combining eight massive BL 15-inch Mk I naval guns with a top speed greater than any battleship on the sea, &quot;Hood&quot; was the pride of Great Britain&#x27;s navy, and embodied the world dominance of British naval power. Despite this, &quot;Hood&quot; had one conspicuous flaw as compared to the super-dreadnought battleships she served alongside: as a battlecruiser, much of her bulk was dedicated to extra engine power instead of comprehensive armour coverage. This came from her design as an Admiral-class battlecruiser to meet the threat of the German s during World War I.

While her 12-inch belt armour was considered sufficient against most capital ships she was likely to encounter, her 3 inches of deck armour left her vulnerable to plunging fire at long range. At the time of her commissioning in World War I, naval gunnery was severely inaccurate at the ranges necessary to produce plunging fire, and &quot;Hood&quot;″s greater speed and maneuverability were seen as an acceptable trade-off. This approach was proved to be flawed after the loss of at the Battle of Jutland and combined with the accuracy of naval gunfire increasing in the inter-war period, &quot;Hood&quot; was eventually scheduled to receive an upgrade in 1939 that would have doubled her deck armour to 6 inches, but the outbreak of World War II meant the upgrade never took place. She thus sortied to war at a marked disadvantage against the new capital ships of the Axis powers.

Aware of &quot;Hood&quot;″s inadequate protective armour, distant to the southeast of where the battle took place, Holland&#x27;s superior (Admiral Sir John Tovey) considered ordering him to have &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sail ahead of &quot;Hood&quot;. With the ships in this position, Tovey concluded the better-protected &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; could draw the German battleships&#x27; large-shell gunfire. Ultimately, Tovey did not give the order, later saying &quot;I did not feel such interference with such a senior officer justified.&quot;

==Prelude==
===Both plans go awry===

The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; had hoped that the &quot;Bismarck&quot; force would enter onto trans-Atlantic commerce raiding, from the Norwegian Sea via the Denmark Strait, undetected and unopposed. The this hope upon a transit from German territorial waters on the North Sea; and, through the territorial waters of German-occupied Norway into the Norwegian Sea, undetected by aerial searches; neutral ship encounters; and traditional &quot;coast-watching&quot; observations performed by formal and informal efforts of maritime intelligence gathering, in the neutral and occupied countries surrounding the North Sea.

In the event, the ground-level coast-watching observations from both neutral and occupied territories identified the principal combatant units sortied for the Exercise Rhine operation from the moment they left German territorial waters. The combatants (&quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;) were identified by in-country coast-watchers located in Denmark; who were able to identify the ships and communicate with their clandestine contacts, the dates and times of the German surface units, moving in their designated coast-watch areas of responsibility.

The HSwMS &quot;Gotland&quot; spotted the transit of &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; in the normal shipping lanes in the North Sea, and reported the movement to the Swedish authorities. Swedish territory as well hosted individual ground-level coast watchers who were able to follow and report on movements in Swedish coastal waters. These observations were passed directly to Royal Navy intelligence by routine maritime diplomatic channels maintained by the British naval attaché in Stockholm. Thus, when &quot;Bismarck&quot; and her escort moved into the unoccupied fjords of German-occupied Norway, for final coastal refuelling and topping off of ships&#x27; stores and supplies, the RAF (weather permitting) was able to keep a final watch on the location and timing of the German raider force.

Holland&#x27;s battle plan was to have &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; engage &quot;Bismarck&quot; while &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; engaged &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; (which, Holland assumed, still steamed behind &quot;Bismarck&quot; and not ahead of her). He signalled this to Captain John C. Leach of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; but did not radio Rear-Admiral Wake-Walker, who as Commander of the 1st Cruiser Squadron directed &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot;, for fear of disclosing his location. Instead, he observed radio silence. Holland hoped to meet the enemy at approximately 02:00. Sunset in this latitude was at 01:51 (ship&#x27;s clocks were four hours ahead of local time). &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; would be silhouetted against the sun&#x27;s afterglow while &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; could approach rapidly, unseen in the darkness, to a range close enough not to endanger &quot;Hood&quot; with plunging fire from &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The Germans would not expect an attack from this quarter, giving the British the advantage of surprise.

The plan&#x27;s success depended on &quot;Suffolk&quot;″s continually unbroken contact with the German ships. However, &quot;Suffolk&quot; lost contact from 00:28. For 90 minutes, Holland neither sighted the German ships nor received any further news from &quot;Norfolk&quot; or &quot;Suffolk&quot;. Reluctantly, Holland ordered &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to turn south-southwest but he detached his destroyers which continued searching to the north. However, the loss of contact should be understood as temporary and tactical only; and not strategic in terms of the tactical outcome. &quot;Suffolk&quot; lost contact with its reconnaissance target (the enemy fleet) in what was essentially a closed, confined rectangular space; aligned generally northeast (the entrance to the Denmark Strait) to southwest (the exit of the Strait into the Atlantic). The enemy units were firmly constrained by the Greenland ice pack to the north, and the extensive Royal Navy minefield to the south along the coast of Iceland. Given the prior warning of the German sortie, there was ample time for the Royal Navy to place armed reconnaissance at both ends of this narrow alignment. &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; were at the eastern entrance to the Strait (where contact was made immediately upon &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s entry). Holland was waiting at the western end as the &quot;Bismarck&quot; force exited the Strait.

Strategically, it was an unquestioned fact (including the approximate timing) that &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;″s entrance into the Atlantic (the fundamental objective of Rhine Exercise), was known from the moment the fleet left German territorial waters. And that was a long enough time span before the fleet&#x27;s final fitting out for transit to the Denmark Strait, that Lütjens could not have helped but to realize, that his force would not under any circumstance enter the Atlantic undetected nor would it enter unopposed. And by the time it was opposed, it would occur with forces that would likely ensure his fleet&#x27;s ultimate destruction. And such destruction would take place before any supply convoy units (the whole purpose of the operation) were threatened by Operation Rhine Exercise.

Before contact was re-established, the two squadrons missed each other narrowly. Had the German ships not altered course to the west at 01:41 to follow the line of the Greenland icepack, the British would have intercepted them much earlier than they did. The British destroyers were just to the southeast when the Germans made this course change. If the visibility had not been reduced to , the German vessels would probably have been spotted (since generally on a calm, clear day ship lookouts can observe large objects and ships about 12 miles (19 km) distant on the horizon. And if the ship&#x27;s lookouts are in a crow&#x27;s nest, the observable distance is even farther).

Just before 03:00, &quot;Suffolk&quot; regained contact with &quot;Bismarck&quot;. &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; were away, slightly ahead of the Germans. Holland signalled to steer toward the Germans and increased speed to . &quot;Suffolk&quot;″s loss of contact had placed the British at a disadvantage. Instead of the swiftly closing head-on approach Holland had envisioned, he would have to converge at a wider angle, much more slowly. This would leave &quot;Hood&quot; vulnerable to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s plunging shells for a much longer period. The situation worsened further when, at 03:20, &quot;Suffolk&quot; reported that the Germans had made a further course alteration to the west, placing the German and British squadrons almost abeam of each other.

At 05:35, lookouts on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; spotted the German ships away. The Germans, already alerted to the British presence through their hydrophonic equipment, picked up the smoke and masts of the British ships 10 minutes later. At this point, Holland had the options of joining &quot;Suffolk&quot; in shadowing &quot;Bismarck&quot; and waiting for Tovey to arrive with &quot;King George V&quot; and other ships to attack, or ordering his squadron into action. He chose the latter at 05:37. The rough seas in the Strait kept the destroyers&#x27; role to a minimum and the cruisers &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; would be too far behind the German force to reach the battle.

==Battle==
===Opening moves===
&quot;Hood&quot; opened fire at 05:52.5 at a distance of approximately . Holland had ordered firing to begin on the leading ship, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, believing from her position that she was &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Holland soon amended his order and directed both ships to engage the rear ship, &quot;Bismarck&quot;. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; had already identified and engaged &quot;Bismarck&quot;, whereas &quot;Hood&quot; is believed to have continued to fire at &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; for some time.

Holland was a gunnery expert; he was well aware of the danger posed by &quot;Hood&quot;″s thin deck armour, which offered weak protection against vertical plunging fire. Holland therefore wanted to reduce the range as quickly as possible, because at a shorter range the trajectory of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s shells would be flatter, and the shells would therefore be more likely to hit the armour belt protecting the sides of the ship or glance off the top deck, rather than penetrate vertically though the deck armour. Holland closed the range at an angle that placed the German ships too far forward of the beam, which meant that only 10 of the 18 British heavy guns could train and presented the Germans with a bigger target than necessary. One of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ forward guns became unserviceable after the first salvo, leaving only 9 still firing. &quot;Suffolk&quot; and &quot;Norfolk&quot; tried to engage &quot;Bismarck&quot; during the action but both were out of range and had an insufficient speed advantage over &quot;Bismarck&quot; to rapidly close the range.

The Germans also had the weather gauge, meaning that the British ships were steaming into the wind, with spray drenching the lenses of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;&#x27; &quot;A&quot; turret&#x27;s Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinder and both British ships&#x27; &quot;B&quot; turret rangefinders. The shorter based () ones in the director towers had to be used instead. Holland had &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; stay close to &quot;Hood&quot;, conforming to &quot;Hood&quot;″s movements instead of varying course and speed, which made it easier for the Germans to find the range to both British ships. It would have aided Holland&#x27;s gunners if they had both fired upon &quot;Bismarck&quot; as originally planned, since they could time precisely each other&#x27;s salvos to avoid mistaking one ship&#x27;s fire for the other. The British could also use &quot;Concentration Fire&quot;, where both ships&#x27; main armament salvos would be controlled by one ship&#x27;s fire control computer—probably &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ modern Admiralty Fire Control Table.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; struck her target first. She would ultimately hit &quot;Bismarck&quot; three times. One shell struck the commander&#x27;s boat and put the seaplane catapult amidships out of action (the latter damage not being discovered until much later, during an attempt to fly off the ship&#x27;s War Diary on the eve of her final battle). The second shell passed through the bow from one side to the other without exploding. The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead to an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it. The last two hits caused damage to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s machinery and medium flooding. The hit also severed a steam line and wounded five of &quot;Bismarck&quot;&#x27;s crew by scalding. The damage to the bow cut access to of fuel oil in the forward fuel tanks, caused &quot;Bismarck&quot; to leave an oil slick and reduced her speed by . &quot;Bismarck&quot; was soon listing 9° to port and lost of freeboard at her bow.
The Germans held their fire until 05:55, when both German ships fired on &quot;Hood&quot;. Lütjens did not immediately give the order to begin firing. &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s first gunnery officer, Adalbert Schneider, asked &quot;&quot; (Permission to open fire?) several times without receiving a response, until the captain of &quot;Bismarck, &quot; &quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; Ernst Lindemann, impatiently responded: &quot;&quot; (I&#x27;m not letting my ship get shot out from under my arse. Permission to fire!)

A shell hit &quot;Hood&quot;″s boat deck, starting a sizable fire in the ready-use ammunition store, but this fire did not spread to other areas of the ship or cause the later explosion. It is possible that &quot;Hood&quot; was struck again at the base of her bridge and in her foretop radar director. There has been contention over which German vessel struck &quot;Hood&quot;; &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; (&quot;Kapitän zur See&quot; Helmuth Brinkmann), was firing at &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, following an order from the fleet commander. The Gunnery Officer of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, Paul Schmalenbach is quoted as saying that &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;&#x27;s target was &quot;Hood&quot;.

===Sinking of &quot;Hood&quot;===
At 06:00, Holland ordered his force to turn once again to port to ensure that the aft main guns on both &quot;Hood&quot; and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; could bear on the German ships. In terms of the force balance this would nominally give Holland&#x27;s force the advantage of 18 large caliber (14/15 in.) guns (10 in &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, 8 in &quot;Hood&quot;); to 8 (8 - 15 in. in &quot;Bismarck&quot;).

During the turn, a salvo from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, fired from about , was seen by men aboard &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to straddle &quot;Hood&quot; abreast her mainmast. This straddle meant that some of the salvos fell to port, some to starboard (of the hull), and some precisely aligned over the center of the main deck of &quot;Hood&quot;. It is likely that one shell struck somewhere between &quot;Hood&quot;″s mainmast and &quot;X&quot; turret aft of the mast. A huge pillar of flame shot upward &#x27;like a giant blowtorch&#x27; in the vicinity of the mainmast.

This was followed by an explosion that destroyed a large portion of the ship from amidships clear to the rear of &quot;Y&quot; turret, blowing both aft turrets into the sea. The ship broke in two and the stern fell away and sank. Ted Briggs, one of the survivors, claimed &quot;Hood&quot; heeled to 30 degrees at which point &#x27;we knew she just wasn&#x27;t coming back&#x27;. The bow rose clear of the water, pointed upward, pivoted about and sank shortly after the stern. &quot;A&quot; turret fired a salvo while in this upright position, possibly from the doomed gun crew, just before the bow section sank.

Splinters rained down on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; away. &quot;Hood&quot; sank in about three minutes with 1,415 members of the crew. Only Ted Briggs, Bob Tilburn and Bill Dundas survived to be rescued two hours later by the destroyer .

The Admiralty later concluded that the most likely explanation for the loss of &quot;Hood&quot; was a penetration of her magazines by a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot;, causing the explosion. Recent research with submersible craft suggests that the initial explosion was in the aft magazine and that it spread to the magazines via the ammunition trunks. It has been suggested from examination of the wreckage, found in 2001, that the magazine explosion in the armament near the mainmast caused the vertical blast of flame seen there, and this in turn ignited the magazines of the aft guns that caused the explosion that wrecked the stern. This explosion might have travelled through the starboard fuel tanks, igniting the fuel oil there, setting off the forward magazines and completing the destruction of the ship.
The wreck of &quot;Hood&quot; revealed the bow section bereft of any structure. A huge section of her side is missing, from the &#x27;A&#x27; barbette to the foredeck. The midship section had its plates curled outward. Moreover, the main parts of the forward structure, including the conning tower, were found about away from the main wreckage. This has sparked theories that the forward magazines exploded as a result of the force, flames and pressure, caused by the detonation of the aft magazines. However, a team of marine forensic scientists has found that implosion damage to the forward hull due to the rapid sinking of the &quot;Hood&quot;, is the most likely cause of the state of the forward hull, and they do not support any theory that the forward magazines exploded.

===&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; alone===

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; found herself steering towards the sinking &quot;Hood&quot;. Her commanding officer, Captain Leach, ordered an emergency avoidance turn away from &quot;Hood&quot;″s wreckage. This violent change of course disrupted her aim and put her in a position that made it easier for the Germans to target her. She resumed her previous course but was now under the concentrated fire of both German ships. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was struck four times by &quot;Bismarck&quot; and three times by &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;. One shell passed through her upper superstructure, killing or wounding several crewmen in the Compass Platform and Air Defence Platform. Pieces of another shell struck her radar office aft, killing the crewmen within.

A shell from &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; found its way to the propelling charge/round manipulation chamber below the aft gun turrets, and a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot; hit underwater below the armour belt, penetrating about into the ship&#x27;s hull, about below the waterline, but was stopped by the anti-torpedo bulkhead. Fortunately for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, neither shell exploded, but she still suffered minor flooding and the loss of some fuel oil.
By this time, serious gunnery malfunctions had caused intermittent problems with the main armament, leading to a 26% reduction in output. According to Captain Leach, he decided that continuing the action would risk losing &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; without inflicting further damage on the enemy. He, therefore, ordered the ship to make smoke and withdraw, &#x27;pending a more favourable opportunity&#x27;. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; turned away just after 06:04, firing from her rear turret under local control until the turret suffered a jammed shell ring, cutting off the ammunition supply and making the guns inoperable.

Despite efforts by crew members and civilian technicians to repair the shell ring, it took until 08:25 for all four guns to be back in service, although two of the guns were serviceable by 07:20. This temporarily left only five guns operational, but nine of the ten were operational in five hours. The final salvos fired were ragged and are believed to have fallen short. The ship retired from the battle around 06:10. Thirteen of her crew had been killed, nine were wounded. The timing of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ withdrawal was fortunate for her, as she had come into torpedo range of &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; and turned away as the German cruiser was about to fire.

===Breaking off the action===
On &quot;Bismarck&quot; there was tremendous elation at the sinking of &quot;Hood&quot;. There was also a keen expectation that they would close on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and possibly finish her off. Lindemann requested that Lütjens allow &quot;Bismarck&quot; to do just that. Even if Tovey&#x27;s squadron had left Scapa Flow the previous day, he would still be more than away from &quot;Bismarck&quot; – even if &quot;Bismarck&quot; diverted to sink &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; (a chase Lindemann calculated would take only two or three hours).

Lütjens refused to allow Lindemann to give chase, giving no explanation. Lindemann repeated his request, this time more assertively. Lütjens held firm orders from the German Naval Commander, &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Erich Raeder, to avoid unnecessary combat with the Royal Navy, especially when it could lead to further damage that could hasten delivering &quot;Bismarck&quot; toward the waiting hands of the British. He broke off combat instead of pursuing &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and ordered a course of 270°, due west. &quot;Bismarck&quot; had fired 93 of her 353 base-fused Armour Piercing (AP) shells during the engagement.

This clash between the two senior German officers reflected their disparate and distinct command functions. As captain of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, Lindemann operated first and foremost as a tactician. As such, he had no doubt that his ship&#x27;s immediate objective was to destroy &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, and he had pressed his case as far and hard as he should. Lütjens, as fleet chief and task force commander, operated at the strategic and operational levels. To some degree, his orders were clear – attacking convoys was his priority, not risking &quot;a major engagement for limited, and perhaps uncertain, goals&quot;. Nevertheless, Raeder had also ordered Lütjens to be bold and imaginative, to accept battle if unavoidable and conduct it vigorously to the finish.

The reality was that Lütjens&#x27; orders did not cover a spectacular success like the one just achieved. His priority therefore was to stick to his instructions - to concentrate on sinking merchant shipping and avoid encounters with enemy warships whenever possible. Moreover, before leaving Germany, Lütjens had told Admirals and Wilhelm Marschall, that he would adhere to Raeder&#x27;s directives. This meant he did not intend to become the third fleet chief to be relieved for contradicting Raeder&#x27;s orders; Marschall, one of his two predecessors, had been relieved of command for not following his orders to the letter despite the fact that Marschall&#x27;s analysis of the changes in the tactical situation since the orders were issued resulted in the sinking of the British aircraft carrier and its two escorting destroyers. Nor was he predisposed to discuss his command decisions with a subordinate officer.

Even if he had known it was the untried &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; he was fighting and not &quot;King George V&quot;, Lütjens would probably have stuck to his decision. Following her would have meant exposing the squadron to further gunfire as well as to torpedo attacks from &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot;. He would have risked his ships and crews on an expressly forbidden opportunity. Lütjens would also have been facing a foe that was still combat effective, despite the hits taken the RN&#x27;s damage assessment was that damage sustained was limited and caused no significant reduction in combat efficiency.

Between 06:19 and 06:25, &quot;Suffolk&quot; fired six salvoes in the direction of &quot;Bismarck&quot;, having mistaken a radar contact with an aircraft for &quot;Bismarck&quot;. &quot;Suffolk&quot; was actually out of gun range of both &quot;Bismarck&quot; and &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; at the time.

==Aftermath==
Holland&#x27;s death led to responsibility for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; falling to Wake-Walker in &quot;Norfolk&quot;. With this command came the responsibility of coping with &quot;Bismarck&quot; until enough British warships could concentrate and destroy her. His choice was either to renew the action with &quot;Bismarck&quot;, or ensure that she be intercepted and brought to action by other heavy units. Wake-Walker chose the latter course, continuing to shadow the German ships. Further offensive action, he concluded, would cause more damage to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; than to &quot;Bismarck&quot; and endanger his cruisers, plus he knew Tovey was on his way. He ordered &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to follow &quot;Norfolk&quot; at her best speed, so that &quot;Norfolk&quot; and &quot;Suffolk&quot; could fall back on her if attacked. At 07:57 &quot;Suffolk&quot; reported that &quot;Bismarck&quot; had reduced speed and appeared damaged.

Since &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s receiving the first hit in the forecastle, all six of the ship&#x27;s 26-man damage control teams had worked to repair the damage. When it was reported that the tips of the starboard propeller could be seen above water, Lindemann had ordered counterflooding two compartments aft to restore the ship&#x27;s trim. He then sent divers into the forecastle to connect the forward fuel tanks, containing a much-needed of fuel, first to the tanks near the forward boiler then to the rear fuel tank by way of a provisional line running over the upper deck.

Both these manoeuvres failed. Lindemann then requested permission to slow &quot;Bismarck&quot; and heel the ship first to one side then the other to weld patches from the inside to the holes in the forward hull. Lütjens refused, again without comment. Eventually, he had to agree to slow the ship to to allow hammocks and collision matting to be stuffed in the holes of the No. 2 boiler room and the auxiliary boiler room to stop the growing ingress of seawater. This attempt also failed. Boiler Room No. 2 was shut down, with a loss of speed to .

As well as taking on seawater, &quot;Bismarck&quot; was leaking fuel oil. Lütjens ordered &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to drop back and see how much of a trail she was leaving astern. The carpet of oil was broad enough to cover both sides of the ship&#x27;s wake, was all colours of the rainbow and gave off a strong smell – all of which helped disclose &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s location.

The damage to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s forward fuel tanks, combined with a missed opportunity to refuel at Bergen earlier in the voyage, left less than of fuel remaining, not enough to operate effectively against the Atlantic convoys. The element of surprise – which was considered essential for the operation&#x27;s success – had most definitely been lost; the German ships continued to be shadowed by Wake-Walker&#x27;s squadron. Lütjens concluded that he needed to abort &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s mission and head toward a convenient dockyard for repairs.

The question was which dockyard to head for. The nearest friendly ports were Bergen and Trondheim in Norway, a little over away. Steaming in that direction meant a return passage north or south of Iceland, with the enemy&#x27;s air forces now fully alerted to their presence and the possibility of other heavy units between them and Scapa Flow. Lütjens knew his intelligence was unreliable. &quot;Hood&quot; had been reported by Group North to be off West Africa and there had been no reports of a &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleship in the vicinity.

Disregarding Lindemann&#x27;s recommendation to return to Bergen, Lütjens ordered &quot;Bismarck&quot; to head for the French port of Saint-Nazaire. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; pursued for several hours and re-engaged on several occasions before the German ships evaded pursuit. Although the French coast was further away than Bergen, Saint-Nazaire held the potential of longer nights and wider seas in which to shake off &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s shadowers, plus the possibility of luring them across a line of U-boats. It would leave &quot;Bismarck&quot; poised on the edge of the British trade routes once the damage were repaired; it also meant the potential support of the battleships and . Both ships had been stationed at Brest in France, since the end of Operation Berlin earlier that year but had been kept in port for repairs and overhaul. While Brest was closer than Saint-Nazaire, it was within range of Royal Air Force bombers.

Lütjens detached the undamaged &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot; to continue raiding on her own. The cruiser went further south into the Atlantic, where she refuelled from a tanker at sea. She suffered engine trouble, abandoned her commerce raiding mission without having sunk any merchant ships, and made it to Brest.

==Reaction==
===German===
News of Lütjens&#x27; decision was received with shock in Berlin, Wilhelmshaven and Paris. A blizzard of urgent telephone calls raced across German-occupied Europe. While the Berlin Admiralty was satisfied with Lütjens&#x27; success, it was tempered by news of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s damage and the decision to head for France. Grand Admiral Raeder was not clear whether Lütjens intended to steam for St. Nazaire immediately or after shaking off his pursuers and oiling in mid-Atlantic. Raeder immediately conferred with his chief of staff, Admiral Otto Schniewind, who in turn telephoned Admiral Rolf Carls, who commanded Group North in Wilhelmshaven.

Carls had already drafted a message recalling Lütjens to Germany, but had not yet sent it. Schniewind pointed out that at noon Lütjens had crossed the demarcation line between the Northern Hebrides and Southern Greenland, thus passing from Group North&#x27;s operational control to Group West; therefore, the decision to recall Lütjens was no longer Carls&#x27; to make. A subsequent call to Group West&#x27;s commander, Admiral Alfred Saalwächter, revealed that he did not plan to recall Lütjens and that he felt such a decision should be discussed between Schniewind and Raeder.

Raeder was against issuing a recall himself, telling Schniewind they did not know enough about the situation at hand and that the person who would best know would be Lütjens. He then telephoned Adolf Hitler, who was at the Obersalzberg in the Bavarian Alps. Hitler received the news of &quot;Hood&quot;″s sinking stoically, exhibiting neither joy nor any other triumphant behaviour. After hearing Raeder&#x27;s report, he turned to those who were with him and expressed his personal thoughts:

If now these British cruisers are maintaining contact and Lütjens has sunk the &quot;Hood&quot; and nearly crippled the other, which was brand new and having trouble with her guns during the action, why didn&#x27;t he sink her too? Why hasn&#x27;t he tried to get out of there or why hasn&#x27;t he turned around?

News of &quot;Hood&quot;″s destruction was seized upon more enthusiastically by Dr. Joseph Goebbels&#x27; Propaganda Ministry. That evening it was broadcast to the nation, accompanied by &quot;We march against England&quot; and other martial airs. The German public, already enjoying the news of Luftwaffe victories over the Royal Navy off Crete, received the news of &quot;Hood&quot;″s sinking euphorically.

===British===

The British public were shocked that their most emblematic warship had been destroyed so suddenly, with the loss of more than 1,400 of her crew. The Admiralty mobilised every available warship in the Atlantic to hunt down and destroy &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The Royal Navy forces pursued and brought &quot;Bismarck&quot; to battle. The German battleship was sunk on the morning of 27 May.

Moves were subsequently made to court-martial Wake-Walker and Captain John Leach of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. The view was taken that they were wrong not to have continued the battle with &quot;Bismarck&quot; after &quot;Hood&quot; had been sunk. John Tovey, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, was appalled at this criticism. A row ensued between Tovey and his superior, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. Tovey stated that the two officers had acted correctly, ensuring that the German ships were tracked and not endangering their ships needlessly. Furthermore, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″s main guns had repeatedly malfunctioned and she could not have matched &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Tovey threatened to resign his position and appear at any court-martial as &#x27;defendant&#x27;s friend&#x27; and defence witness. No more was heard of the proposal.

A British board of enquiry quickly investigated the cause of &quot;Hood&quot;″s explosion and produced a report. After criticism that the initial enquiry did not record all the available evidence, a second board of enquiry more extensively investigated &quot;Hood&quot;″s loss, and examined the vulnerabilities of other large British warships still in service in light of the probable causes of the explosion. It, like the first enquiry, concluded that a shell from &quot;Bismarck&quot; caused the explosion of &quot;Hood&quot;″s aft ammunition magazines. This led to refitting some older British warships with increased protection for their ammunition magazines and some other related improvements.

Many naval historians and writers have analyzed the &quot;Bismarck&quot; engagement and weighed the participants&#x27; decisions. One of the most debated is Lütjens&#x27; decision to proceed into the Atlantic rather than continue the battle.

==Parallels to Jutland==
A number of parallels were drawn by historian Correlli Barnett between Holland&#x27;s actions and those of Admiral David Beatty in the opening stages of the Battle of Jutland. According to Barnett, Holland felt he had to engage &quot;Bismarck&quot; immediately, rather than support Wake-Walker in shadowing until Force &#x27;H&#x27; could arrive. Beatty, likewise, felt he needed to engage German Admiral Franz Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers with his own forces instead of drawing the Germans toward Admiral John Jellicoe and the rest of the British Grand Fleet.

Holland, like Beatty, possessed superiority in the number of heavy ships he possessed, yet he was encumbered by an inferiority in the fighting effectiveness of those units. Moreover, Holland&#x27;s deployment of his units compared to Beatty&#x27;s deployment at Jutland. Beatty and Holland both attacked while German units were well before the beam. As a result, the midship and aft turrets of Beatty&#x27;s ships could barely fire on the enemy. Holland&#x27;s ships could not use their aft turrets until the final turn to port just before &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk.

Beatty placed his lighter-armoured battlecruisers at the head of his line, leaving the more powerful and better-armoured battleships in the rear. Likewise, Holland placed the old and vulnerable &quot;Hood&quot; ahead of the better armoured (albeit new and untested) &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. Both admirals exercised tight tactical control over their units from their flagships. This prevented Captain Leach from manoeuvring &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; independently and possibly taking a different line of approach that might have confused the Germans.

==Order of battle==
Note: The British escorting destroyers were ordered to the battle coordinates as part of the overall forces sent to intercept the German ships; they were detached the evening before the battle.

<text>Richmond Alexander Lattimore (May 6, 1906 – February 26, 1984) was an American poet and classicist known for his translations of the Greek classics, especially his versions of the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Biography==
Richmond Alexander Lattimore was born to David and Margaret Barnes Lattimore in Paotingfu, China. His parents were working as English teachers for the Chinese government. His family returned the United States in 1920. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1926. His brother Owen Lattimore was a Sinologist who was blacklisted for his association with China during the McCarthy era, but subsequently rehabilitated when none of the charges against him proved to be true. Their sister Eleanor Frances Lattimore was an author and illustrator of children&#x27;s books.

Richmond was a Rhodes Scholar at Christ Church, Oxford, and received his B.A. in 1932, and subsequently, under the direction of William Abbott Oldfather, received a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois in 1934. He joined the Department of Greek at Bryn Mawr College the following year, and married Alice Bockstahler, with whom he later had two sons, Steven and Alexander; Steven also became a classical scholar and professor at UCLA.

From 1943 to 1946, Lattimore was absent from his professorial post to serve in the United States Navy but returned after the war to remain at Bryn Mawr College, with periodic visiting positions at other universities, until his retirement in 1971. He continued to publish poems and translations for the remainder of his life, with two poems appearing in print posthumously.

From 1953 to 1960, he partnered with David Grene to co-edit a complete translation of the Greek tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides for University of Chicago Press.

He translated the Book of Revelation in 1962. A 1979 edition by McGraw-Hill Ryerson included the four Gospels. Lattimore completed his translation of the entire New Testament, which was published posthumously in 1996 with the title &quot;The New Testament&quot;.

For many years, Lattimore accompanied his wife Alice to services at the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd, Rosemont, near Bryn Mawr College, a church with an Anglo-Catholic worship tradition. He chose to be baptized on Easter Eve 1983 and confirmed as a communicant there. He stated that his doubts about his faith had disappeared &quot;somewhere in [the Gospel of] Saint Luke,&quot; which he had recently translated.

Lattimore died from cancer in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, on February 26, 1984, aged 77.

==Memberships and awards==
Lattimore was a Fellow of the Academy of American Poets, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the American Philological Association, and the Archaeological Institute of America, as well as a Fellow of the American Academy at Rome and an Honorary Student at Christ Church, Oxford. Lattimore&#x27;s translation of Aristophanes&#x27; &quot;The Frogs&quot; won the Bollingen Poetry Translation Prize in 1962.

<doc id="684257" wikidata="Q967846" url="?curid=684257" title="Umberto Agnelli">
<text>Umberto Agnelli (; 1 November 1934 – 27 May 2004) was an Italian industrialist and politician. He was the third son of Virginia (born &quot;Donna&quot; Virginia Bourbon del Monte) and Edoardo Agnelli, and the youngest brother of Gianni Agnelli.

Agnelli served as a CEO of Italian carmaker Fiat from 1970 to 1976. After the death of his brother, he was briefly chairman of the Fiat Group until his death, aged 69, in 2004. He was also chairman and later honorary chairman of Juventus, the football team long-associated with Fiat and the Agnelli family, and was for a time the president of the Italian Football Federation. He was a Christian Democracy member of the Senate of the Republic from 1976 to 1979. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Agnelli was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 1 November 1934, as the youngest of seven children. After the premature deaths of his parents, Edoardo Agnelli and Virginia Bourbon del Monte in two unrelated accidents, he was raised by his older brother Gianni Agnelli. He graduated in law at the University of Catania. Like his brother and his grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli, who cofounded Fiat S.p.A. in 1899, he also carried out his military service at the Pinerolo Cavalry Application School.

== Career ==

Agnelli was chairman of Fiat France from 1965 to 1980, chief executive officer of Fiat from 1970 to 1976 and its vice president from 1976 to 1993. He was chairman of Fiat Auto from 1980 to 1990, and was a member of the International Advisory Board from 1993 to 2004. He was also chairman of Juventus between 1956 and 1961 and was honorary chairman from 1970 to 2004. He led the club to become the most successful in Italian football.

Engaged for a long time in the Fiat restructuring process, with the simultaneous opening towards foreign capital and markets, Agnelli and his family were listed 278th in the 2003 &quot;Forbes&quot; ranking of the richest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of around US$1.5 billion. Although he was a senior executive at Fiat, Agnelli was sidelined from taking a leadership role by his older brother, whom he had supported for a long time in the management of the family company even if often forced to remain on the bench for financial power games, until the latter&#x27;s death in 2003.

From 2003 to 2004, Agnelli took over as chairman of the Fiat Group. Compared to the past, he decided to change his strategy by concentrating all Fiat resources on the car and turning to an external manager, Giuseppe Morchio, to whom he would entrust the leadership of the company. The Agnelli family&#x27;s management was described as progressive and paternalistic.

Starting in the 1980s and accelerating into the 1990s, when the company was struggling, Agnelli was the architect of Fiat&#x27;s diversification. The Fiat Group controlled several Italian newspapers and publishers in addition to the Fiat car firms and Juventus. Agnelli was in the process of restoring Fiat&#x27;s fortunes, following a period in which the company&#x27;s balance sheet, market share, and share value had all been in decline in the company&#x27;s worst financial crisis, when he suddenly died of lung cancer after 18 months in control. Despite this, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that he was the world&#x27;s 68th richest man with an approximate net worth of US$5.5 billion. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group.

== Juventus==
Elected in 1955 by a council of members, including his older brother, who was president of the club, he became the youngest person to assume the highest managerial position in the history of Juventus. His management was characterized by the signings of important players, such as John Charles and Omar Sívori, who proved to be decisive for the conquest of three Serie A championships and two consecutive Coppa Italias from 1958 to 1961. Before he died, Agnelli was instrumental in signing Fabio Capello as Juventus coach in 2004. He also had transformed the club into a modern publicly-listed company with important investment projects. After leaving the presidential role in 1962, Agnelli remained tied to Juventus. In 1994, he took over the management activities previously carried out by his brother, exerting greater influence on the club as honorary president during the following decade, a period in which the club won another five Serie A titles, one more Coppa Italia, four Supercoppa Italianas, one Intercontinental Cup, one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Intertoto Cup and one UEFA Super Cup, for a total of 19 trophies in 18 years. By virtue of the sporting successes achieved during his managerial sporting career, Agnelli was jointly inducted by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) and the Coverciano Football Museum Foundation into the Italian Football Hall of Fame in 2015.

In 1999, Juventus improved their own record of having won all five major UEFA competitions by winning the Intertoto Cup, the next year was voted the seventh best of the FIFA Club of the Century and in 2009 was placed by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics second in the European best club of the 20th-century ranking, the highest for an Italian club in both; by the early 2000s, the club had the third best revenue in Europe at over €200 million. This all changed when, three years after his death, &quot;Calciopoli&quot; controversially hit the club, which was demoted to Serie B for the first time in its history, despite the club being acquitted and the leagues were ruled to be regular; it was his son, Andrea Agnelli, who built the club back up in the 2010s. When Agnelli died in 2004, Juventus had won the 2001–02 Serie A, the club&#x27;s 26th &quot;scudetto&quot;, at the last matchday, and had reached the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the club&#x27;s four UEFA Champions League final in seven years, three of which were achieved consecutively; those in 1997, against Borussia Dortmund, and in 1998, against Real Madrid, were lost out controversially. In the words of Fulvio Bianchi, early 2000s Juventus were &quot;stronger than all those that came after, and had €250 million in revenue, being at the top of Europe, and 100 sponsors. It took ten years to recover and return to the top Italians, not yet Europeans: now the club makes over €300 million, but in the meantime Real, Bayern, and the others have taken off.&quot;

Some observers allege that &quot;Calciopoli&quot; and its aftermath were a dispute within Juventus and between the club&#x27;s owners that came after the deaths of Umberto and Gianni Agnelli, including Franzo Grande Stevens and Gianluigi Gabetti who favoured Agnelli&#x27;s grandson, John Elkann, over his nephew as chairman, and wanted to get rid of Luciano Moggi, Antonio Giraudo, and Roberto Bettega, whose shares in the club increased. Whatever their intentions, it is argued they condemned Juventus: first when Carlo Zaccone, the club&#x27;s lawyer, agreed for relegation to Serie B and point-deduction, when he made that statement because Juventus were the only club risking more than one-division relegation (Serie C), and he meant for Juventus (the sole club to be ultimately demoted) to have equal treatment with the other clubs; and then when Luca Cordero di Montezemolo retired the club&#x27;s appeal to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, which could have cleared the club&#x27;s name and avoid relegation, after FIFA threatened to suspend the FIGC from international play, a renounce for which then-FIFA president Sepp Blatter was thankful.

Several observers, including former FIGC president Franco Carraro, argue that had Agnelli been alive, things would have done different, as the club and its directors would have been defended properly, which could have avoided relegation and cleared the club&#x27;s name much earlier than the Calciopoli trials of the 2010s. It is argued that Agnelli would have taken the same position as his son, but much harder. Moggi, one of the two Juventus directors involved in the scandal, said that &quot;Calciopoli&quot; only happened because &quot;&quot;l&#x27;Avvocato&quot; Agnelli and &quot;il Dottor&quot; Umberto died&quot;, and had the two Agnellis not died, &quot;nothing [of this farce] would have happened.&quot; According to observers, Juventus was weak after the deaths of the Agnelli, with Moggi saying this &quot;made us orphans and weak, it was easy to attack Juve and destroy them by making things up.&quot; According to critics, Juventus bothered because they won too much under Agnelli. Then-CONI president Gianni Petrucci said &quot;a team that wins too much is harmful to their sport.&quot;

== Politics ==

Politically, the Agnelli family sought to create a non-ideological, centrist political formation of Atlanticist and pro-European persuasion that sought a modernising, internationalist capitalism in contrast to the left and opposed to the populist, nationalist, or fascist right. In the 1970s, Agnelli was elected a member of the Senate of the Republic for Christian Democracy (DC). This came after the DC won over a struggle in which Gianni Agnelli would be present in the Italian Republican Party list for the 1976 Italian general election, a move that could have cost them about one million votes. In turn, the DC obtained the candidacy of Agnelli as a senator, a position he held until 1979. He took his role seriously, and he held a conference of DC senators in Rome to discuss the renewal of the party; in response, he was admonished.

== Personal life and death ==
Agnelli&#x27;s life was beset by an unusual amount of tragedy and bereavement. His father, Edoardo Agnelli, perished in an air crash when he was one year old; his mother, Virginia Bourbon del Monte, died in a car accident in 1945 when he was 11 years old. His nephew, Edoardo Agnelli, committed suicide in 2000.

In 1959, Agnelli married a cousin of his sister-in-law Marella Agnelli, the heiress &quot;Donna&quot; Antonella Bechi Piaggio, from the well-known business family of Piaggio that created Vespa, who later married a distant maternal relative of Allegra Caracciolo, Uberto Visconti di Modrone. Agnelli and Bechi Piaggio had three sons but their first, twin boys, died shortly after birth. The third son was Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, who grew up to be the head of the maternal family-firm Piaggio, and was being groomed to succeed at Fiat but died of cancer at the age of 33 in 1997. After he divorced from his wife, Agnelli married &quot;Donna&quot; Allegra Caracciolo di Castagneto in 1974. She is the first cousin of Agnelli&#x27;s sister-in-law Marella Caracciolo di Castagneto, also the wife of Agnelli&#x27;s brother. The ladies come from a noble family dating back to the Kingdom of Naples that has, among others, the titles of nobility of Prince of Castagneto and Duke of Melito. From his second marriage came two children, who were named Andrea (born 1975) and Anna (born 1977). His son, Andrea Agnelli, later followed in his footsteps by becoming chairman of Juventus in 2010.

Suffering from lung cancer, which became public only a month before his death after a &quot;Financial Times&quot; report, Agnelli spent his last days assisted by his wife and two children at their residence in La Mandria, which included La Mandria Regional Park, in the Venaria Reale area, where he died on 27 May 2004, fifteen days before the death of his nephew, Prince Egon von Fürstenberg. His last public appearance had taken place on 26 April, when his wife was awarded an honorary degree in veterinary medicine by the University of Turin. Agnelli&#x27;s worsening health conditions prevented him from attending the Fiat shareholders&#x27; meeting on 11 May.

<doc id="684268" wikidata="Q62910" url="?curid=684268" title="Carver Mead">
<text>Carver Andress Mead (born 1 May 1934) is an American scientist and engineer. He currently holds the position of Gordon and Betty Moore Professor Emeritus of Engineering and Applied Science at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), having taught there for over 40 years. 

A pioneer of modern microelectronics, Mead has made contributions to the development and design of semiconductors, digital chips, and silicon compilers, technologies which form the foundations of modern very-large-scale integration chip design. Mead has also been involved in the founding of more than 20 companies. 

In the 1980s, Mead focused on electronic modeling of human neurology and biology, creating &quot;neuromorphic electronic systems.&quot; Most recently, he has called for the reconceptualization of modern physics, revisiting the theoretical debates of Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein and others in light of later experiments and developments in instrumentation.

Mead&#x27;s contributions as a teacher include the classic textbook &quot;Introduction to VLSI Systems&quot; (1980), which he coauthored with Lynn Conway. He also taught Deborah Chung, the first female engineering graduate of Caltech, and advised Louise Kirkbride, the school&#x27;s first female electrical engineering student. 

== Early life and education ==
Carver Andress Mead was born in Bakersfield, California, and grew up in Kernville, California. His father worked in a power plant at the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project, owned by Southern California Edison Company. Carver attended a tiny local school for some years, then moved to Fresno, California to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school. He became interested in electricity and electronics while very young, seeing the work at the power plant, experimenting with electrical equipment, qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations.

Mead studied electrical engineering at Caltech, getting his BS in 1956, his MS in 1957, and his PhD degree in 1960.

==Microelectronics==

Mead&#x27;s contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices, often in novel ways. During the 1960s, he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors, developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling, barrier behavior and hot electron transport. In 1960, he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a three-terminal solid-state device based on the operating principles of electron tunneling and hot-electron transport. In 1962 he demonstrated that using tunnel emission, hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold. His studies of III-V compounds (with W. G. Spitzer) established the importance of interface states, laying the groundwork for band-gap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices.

=== GaAs MESFET ===
In 1966, Mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate field-effect transistor using a Schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel. As a material, GaAs offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon. The GaAs MESFET became the dominant microwave semiconductor device, used in a variety of high-frequency wireless electronics, including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes, satellite dishes and cellular phones. Carver&#x27;s work on MESFETs also became the basis for the later development of HEMTs by Fujitsu in 1980. HEMTs, like MESFETs, are accumulation-mode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems.

===Moore&#x27;s law===
Mead is credited by Gordon Moore with coining the term Moore&#x27;s law, to denote the prediction Moore made in 1965 about the growth rate of the component count, &quot;a component being a transistor, resistor, diode or capacitor,&quot; fitting on a single integrated circuit. Moore and Mead began collaborating around 1959 when Moore gave Mead &quot;cosmetic reject&quot; transistors from Fairchild Semiconductor for his students to use in his classes. During the 1960s Mead made weekly visits to Fairchild, visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with Moore. During one of their discussions, Moore asked Mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor. When told that it would, he asked what the limit would be.

Stimulated by Moore&#x27;s question, Mead and his students began a physics-based analysis of possible materials, trying to determine a lower bound for Moore&#x27;s Law. In 1968, Mead demonstrated, contrary to common assumptions, that as transistors decreased in size, they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower. Rather, he argued that transistors would get faster, better, cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized. His results were initially met with considerable skepticism, but as designers experimented, results supported his assertion. In 1972, Mead and graduate student Bruce Hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as 0.15 microns. This lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected. Despite initial doubts, Mead&#x27;s prediction influenced the computer industry&#x27;s development of submicron technology. When Mead&#x27;s predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in 2000, the transistor was highly similar to the one Mead had originally described.

===Mead–Conway VLSI design===
Mead was the first to predict the possibility of creating millions of transistors on a chip. His prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability. Mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for very-large-scale integration, designing and creating high-complexity microchips.

He taught the world&#x27;s first LSI design course, at Caltech in 1970. Throughout the 1970s, with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes, Mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design. He worked with Ivan Sutherland and Frederick B. Thompson to establish computer science as a department at Caltech, which formally occurred in 1976. Also in 1976, Mead co-authored a DARPA report with Ivan Sutherland and Thomas Eugene Everhart, assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of &quot;very-large-scale integrated circuits&quot;.

Beginning in 1975, Carver Mead collaborated with Lynn Conway from Xerox PARC. They developed the landmark text &quot;Introduction to VLSI systems&quot;, published in 1979, an important spearhead of the Mead and Conway revolution. A pioneering textbook, it has been used in VLSI integrated circuit education all over the world for decades. The circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach. They also demonstrated the feasibility of multi-project shared-wafer methodology, creating chips for students in their classes.

Their work caused a paradigm shift, a &quot;fundamental reassessment&quot; of the development of integrated circuits, and &quot;revolutionized the world of computers&quot;. In 1981, Mead and Conway received the Award for Achievement from &quot;Electronics Magazine&quot; in recognition of their contributions. More than 30 years later, the impact of their work is still being assessed.

Building on the ideas of VLSI design, Mead and his PhD student David L. Johannsen created the first silicon compiler, capable of taking a user&#x27;s specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit. Mead, Johannsen, Edmund K. Cheng and others formed Silicon Compilers Inc. (SCI) in 1981. SCI designed one of the key chips for Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s MicroVAX minicomputer.
Mead and Conway laid the groundwork for the development of the MOSIS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) and the fabrication of the first CMOS chip. Mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies. The companies then design special-purpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries.

==Neural models of computing==
Next Mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation: animal and human brains. His interest in biological models dated back at least to 1967, when he met biophysicist Max Delbrück. Delbrück had stimulated Mead&#x27;s interest in transducer physiology, the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena.

Observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina, Mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches. He noted parallels between charges moving in MOS transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons. He worked with Nobelist John Hopfield and Nobelist Richard Feynman, helping to create three new fields: neural networks, neuromorphic engineering, and the physics of computation. Mead, considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering, is credited with coining the term &quot;neuromorphic processors&quot;.

Mead was then successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies, in part due to an early connection with Arnold Beckman, chairman of the Caltech Board of Trustees. Mead has said that his preferred approach to development is &quot;technology push&quot;, exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it.

=== Touch ===
In 1986, Mead and Federico Faggin founded Synaptics Inc. to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories, suitable for use in vision and speech recognition. The first product Synaptics brought to market was a pressure-sensitive computer touchpad, a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers. The Synaptics touchpad was extremely successful, at one point capturing 70% of the touchpad market.

=== Hearing ===
In 1988, Richard F. Lyon and Carver Mead described the creation of an analog cochlea, modelling the fluid-dynamic traveling-wave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear. Lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea. Such technology had potential applications in hearing aids, cochlear implants, and a variety of speech-recognition devices. Their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea.

In 1991, Mead helped to form Sonix Technologies, Inc. (later Sonic Innovations Inc.). Mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids. In addition to being small, the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid. Release of the company&#x27;s first product, the Natura hearing aid, took place in September 1998.

=== Vision ===
In the late 1980s, Mead advised Misha Mahowald, a PhD student in computation and neural systems, to develop the silicon retina, using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells, cone cells, and other excitable cells in the retina of the eye. Mahowald&#x27;s 1992 thesis received Caltech&#x27;s Milton and Francis Clauser Doctoral Prize for its originality and &quot;potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor&quot;. her work was considered &quot;the best attempt to date&quot; to develop a stereoscopic vision system. Mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina, using a two-dimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina.

Around 1999, Mead and others established Foveon, Inc. in Santa Clara, California to develop new digital camera technology based on neurally-inspired CMOS image sensor/processing chips. The image sensors in the Foveon X3 digital camera captured multiple colors for each pixel, detecting red, green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor. This provided more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras, which detect one color per pixel. It has been hailed as revolutionary. In 2005, Carver Mead, Richard B. Merrill and Richard Lyon of Foveon were awarded the Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society, for the development of the Foveon X3 sensor.

=== Synapses ===
Mead&#x27;s work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble biological synapses.
In 1995 and 1996 Mead, Hasler, Diorio, and Minch presented single-transistor silicon synapses capable of analog learning applications and long-term memory storage. Mead pioneered the use of floating-gate transistors as a means of non-volatile storage for neuromorphic and other analog circuits.

Mead and Diorio went on to found the radio-frequency identification (RFID) provider Impinj, based on their work with floating-gate transistors (FGMOS)s. Using low-power methods of storing charges on FGMOSs, Impinj developed applications for flash memory storage and radio frequency identity tags.

== Reconceptualizing physics ==

Carver Mead has developed an approach he calls &quot;Collective Electrodynamics&quot;, in which electromagnetic effects, including quantized energy transfer, are derived from the interactions of the wavefunctions of electrons behaving collectively. In this formulation, the photon is a non-entity, and Planck&#x27;s energy–frequency relationship comes from the interactions of electron eigenstates. The approach is related to John Cramer&#x27;s transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics, to the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, and to Gilbert N. Lewis&#x27;s early description of electromagnetic energy exchange at zero interval in spacetime.

Although this reconceptualization does not pertain to gravitation, a gravitational extension of it makes predictions that differ from general relativity. For instance, gravitational waves should have a different polarization under &quot;G4v&quot;, the name given to this new theory of gravity. Moreover, this difference in polarization can be detected by advanced LIGO.

<text>Castleton is a former town in the U.S. state of New York. It was located in the northeastern part of Staten Island prior to the incorporation of Staten Island into New York City in 1898. It had a total area of 3880 acres (15.7 km) and was bounded by Upper New York Bay on the east and the Kill Van Kull on the north.

The town dates from the late 17th century. It was originally set aside as the manor of the governor of the Province of New York and takes its name from the manor of Governor Thomas Dongan who named it for his home Castletown, in the town Kildrought (now Celbridge) in County Kildare, Ireland. The original manor house was constructed along Richmond Terrace, between Dongan Street and Bodine Street. It was destroyed by fire on December 25, 1878. The town was incorporated by the state of New York in 1788.

The town was dissolved in 1898 upon consolidation into the City of New York.

The former town included the present-day neighborhoods of
*Castleton Corners
*New Brighton
*St. George
*Silver Lake
*Tompkinsville

<doc id="684277" wikidata="Q5098081" url="?curid=684277" title="Children's Fairyland">
<text>Children&#x27;s Fairyland, U.S.A. is an amusement park, located in Oakland, California, on the shores of Lake Merritt. It was one of the earliest &quot;themed&quot; amusement parks in the United States. Fairyland includes of play sets, small rides, and animals. The park is also home to the Open Storybook Puppet Theater, the oldest continuously operating puppet theater in the United States.

Fairyland was built in 1950 by the Oakland Lake Merritt Breakfast Club, a local service club. The park was immediately recognized nationally for its unique value, and during the 1950s it inspired numerous towns to create their own parks. Walt Disney toured many amusement parks in 1950, including Children’s Fairyland, seeking ideas for what turned out to be Disneyland. He hired the first director of Fairyland, Dorothy Manes, to work at Disneyland as youth director, in which position she continued from the park&#x27;s opening until 1972.

Numerous artists have contributed exhibits, murals, puppetry, and sculptures to the park. Some of the better-known artists are Ruth Asawa and Frank Oz, who was an apprentice puppeteer in the park as a teenager.

==Origins of the park==
On a 1947 trip to the Detroit children&#x27;s zoo in Belle Isle Park, Oakland nurseryman Arthur Navlet saw a collection of small nursery-rhyme themed buildings, and wanted to create something similar in Oakland&#x27;s Lake Merritt Park. His hope was to create much larger sets that children could climb in and interact with. After getting the backing of the Lake Merritt Breakfast Club, a civic organization devoted to improving the park, he took his ideas to William Penn Mott Jr., then director of Oakland&#x27;s parks department. Mott and the Breakfast Club were able to raise $50,000 from Oakland citizens. Contributing sponsors included Earl Warren, Clifford E. Rishell, Joseph R. Knowland and Thomas E. Caldecott.

Navlet hired fantasy artist and architect William Russell Everritt (1904–1978) to design the original 17 sets. Everritt originally presented models which followed a standard fantasy architecture: straight-sided, &quot;precious&quot; buildings in gingerbread and candy. When told his models were too staid, he delightedly destroyed them and came back with buildings with no straight sides and outré colors and textures. It was exactly what Navlet was looking for.

==The original park==
The park opened on September 2, 1950. Admission was 9 to 14 cents, depending on age. The original guides to the park were a dwarfish married couple dressed in glamorous Munchkin-style costumes. The park was reported on nationally, with numerous newsreels shot in the park. The original sets included Pinocchio&#x27;s Castle, Thumbelina, Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Merry Miller, The Three Little Pigs, Willie the Whale, and several others. The entrance to the park was through the shoe illustrating the Old Woman in the Shoe. The entrance through the shoe was sized for children, so that adults had to bend over to go through. The park thrived, and in 1956, the City of Oakland Parks and Recreation Department hired Burton Weber to promote the wonders inside Fairyland’s gates. Weber created a program for young children called Fairyland Personalities, which is still part of Fairyland&#x27;s Children’s Theater program.

Fairyland is also home to the original &quot;Magic Key&quot; and Talking Storybook Boxes. Oakland television personality Bruce Sedley would often make appearances at the park to tell the stories of the sets. The constant strain of speaking threatened his voice, and he invented a system of talking books with recorded stories on tape. The boxes were activated by a plastic key. Sedley took the system he developed at Fairyland to zoos and children&#x27;s parks across the country, where they are still used extensively. The Magic Key system is still in effect at Fairyland.

== Puppet theater ==
Fairyland’s Storybook Puppet Theater, which opened in 1956, is the oldest continuously operating puppet theater in the United States. The theater presents three performances a day, year round, from a repertoire of more than 150 puppet shows. Most of the shows are based on classic fairytales and folk tales from around the world, including &quot;The Three Little Pigs,&quot; &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and &quot;The Pied Piper&quot;. All of the puppets – including bunraku, shadow puppets, hand puppets, rod puppets, and marionettes – are constructed at the theater by the puppet director and apprentices.

The theater structure was designed by the park’s original architect, William Russell Everitt, with the assistance of members of the San Francisco Bay Area Puppeteers Guild. It accommodated hand and rod puppets. For the theater’s 50th anniversary, in 2006, the building was redesigned with a storage area, workshop, and higher ceiling for dramatic effects.

Many accomplished puppeteers have worked at Fairyland’s puppet theater, including Tony Urbano, Luman Coad, and Frances and Isadore (&quot;Mike&quot;) Oznowicz. The Oznowiczes’ son, Frank, performed at the theater when he was a teenager; he later shortened his name to Frank Oz and went on to perform with The Muppets and to direct many Hollywood films. Muppet performer Alice Dinnean also got her start at Fairyland&#x27;s puppet theater. Lewis Mahlmann, who served as the puppet theater’s director from 1967 to 2005, authored four books about puppetry, and twice served as president of the Puppeteers of America.

The current theater director is Randal J. Metz, who apprenticed with Mahlmann while he was still in grade school. Metz shared the director’s job with Mahlmann beginning in 1991, and became sole director upon Mahlmann’s retirement in 2005.

==The park today==

The park continued to grow through the early years, adding the Open Storybook Puppet Theater, also designed by Everritt, in 1956, as well as other sets. In 1994, with help from the Lake Merritt Breakfast Club, Fairyland applied for and received 501(c) (3) nonprofit status to allow it to apply for grants, receive bond funds, and solicit donations.

In 2006, the Storybook Puppet Theater celebrated its 50th anniversary with a near-complete renovation including the addition of a new facade and workshop. The current master puppeteer is Randal Metz.

In addition to exhibits, the park today has rides such as the spiderweb Ferris wheel, a carousel, and the Jolly Trolly (a train). For safety reasons, Fairyland admits adults only when they’re accompanied by children and children only when they’re accompanied by adults.

==Aesop&#x27;s Playhouse==

In 2008, Fairyland opened Aesop&#x27;s Playhouse, a dedicated children&#x27;s theater funded by Oakland City bond measure DD. It is a Greek theater-style outdoor amphitheater seating 215 people. Fairyland had a long tradition of plays put on by local children ages 8–10, but they were performed on the smaller Emerald City Stage. Previous plays have included &quot;The Monkey King&#x27;s Journey to the West,&quot; &quot;Brer Rabbit,&quot; &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Cuoi&quot;, &quot;the Boy in the Moon&quot;, &quot;Ohana Means Family&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood,&quot; &quot;Lost in Fairyland&quot;, &quot;Hip-Hop Pinocchio&quot;, &quot;The Panchatantra&quot;, &quot;Méxica&quot;, &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Lost Her Smile&quot;, &quot;Harvest at the Lake&quot;, &quot;Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type&quot;, &quot;The Cat in the Hat&quot;, and &quot;Five Little Monkeys&quot;.

<doc id="684285" wikidata="Q936636" url="?curid=684285" title="French Frigate Shoals">
<text>The French Frigate Shoals (Hawaiian: Kānemilohai) is the largest atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Its name commemorates French explorer Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who nearly lost two frigates when attempting to navigate the shoals. It consists of a crescent-shaped reef, twelve sandbars, and the La Perouse Pinnacle, the only remnant of its volcanic origins. The total land area of the islets is , while the total coral reef area of the shoals is over . Tern Island, with an area of , has a landing strip and permanent habitations for a small number of people. It is maintained as a field station in the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The French Frigate Shoals are about northwest of Honolulu. Among the shoals are Tern, which is unique in having an airstrip and is protected by a seawall, and La Perouse Pinnacle, a tall and rocky island in the center of the shoals. The two largest islands after Tern, East and Trig, have mostly washed away, with East being about half the size from storms, but are famed as breeding grounds for turtles. East was also home to Coast Guard base in the late 20th century. The islands are surrounded by a coral reef, and the islands themselves are noted breeding ground for turtles, seals, and birds. Habitation is difficult with little vegetation and no fresh water. The French Frigate Shoals are also called Lalo as part of the marine nature reserve, and along with other islands are visited periodically for research. The highest point in the shoals is on La Perouse Pinnacle, which is a volcanic rock that rises above the surrounding lagoon.

In the 20th century, the shoals were used by the Imperial Japanese Navy as part of an operation to attack Hawaii. Afterwards, a small United States Navy base was established there to prevent it from being used again. After the war it was used by the United States Coast Guard for a LORAN radio navigation station. By the 21st century, it was primarily used for oceanographic and biological study as a nature reserve. Studies at the island helped establish the nature of plastic pollution, and in 2020 one island was designated as contaminated by plastic pollution from the ocean. The reefs are noted for having survived many Pacific storms, although these storms have damaged facilities, wildlife, and significantly reduced the area of some islands.

==History==
The islands were discovered by the French in the late 18th century and was formally claimed by the United States in 1859 under the Guano Islands Act. The main focus of the USA was to administer it as a wildlife refuge, but it became involved in military events during WW2, and one island was transformed into an airbase. After World War II, the island was turned over to Hawaii, and it served several different purposes. The shoals were used by the Empire of Japan as a staging point for their surprise attack on the Hawaiian Islands, but were then occupied by U.S. forces. A few months later, it was again near the front lines in the battle of Midway. After that battle, one island, Tern, was made into an airstrip and base. In addition, East Island also had a base on it. After the war, the shoals were used for a radio location base called LORAN, and the airstrip was used for fishing. A coast guard base was on the island until 1979, and then the Fish and Wildlife Service until 2012. One issue was the large Pacific storms that affected the islands. In the 21st century, the decayed Tern Island seawall was partially repaired, and in 2018 East Island was nearly washed away. In the 2020s, the shoals are a noted nature reserve and routinely visited for research. Issues that are studied include marine life, including coral, sharks, fish, seals, sea turtles, and many types of birds. There is also marine archeology conducted on sea wrecks, and a rare whaling vessel wreck was discovered here.

===Overview and early history===

Although there is no evidence of extensive human activity or presence in the area, the earliest human visitors to the French Frigate Shoals probably came from the main Hawaiian Islands, which were settled by Polynesians between 1100 and 1300 AD.

The Hawaiian island chain lay outside the routes followed by early European explorers, and it was not until Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse&#x27;s near-disastrous discovery that the shoals were known to the outside world. La Pérouse, aboard the frigate &quot;Boussole&quot;, was sailing westward from Monterey en route to Macau. During the night of 6 November 1786, sailors sighted breakers directly in their path, about a thousand feet ahead. Both the &quot;Boussole&quot; and her companion vessel, the frigate &quot;Astrolabe&quot;, were immediately brought about, passing within a few hundred feet of the breakers. At daybreak, the ships returned and mapped the southeastern half of the atoll, as well as finding the rock that would later be named after La Pérouse. La Pérouse named the shoals &quot;Basse des Frégates Françaises&quot;, the &quot;Shoal of the French Frigates&quot;.

The expedition went on to discover the nearby Necker Island. His ships were &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; (under command of Fleuriot de Langle) and the &quot;La Boussole&quot;. La Perouse was on a mission of exploration from the French Academy of Sciences, and they made many discoveries in across the Pacific. The expedition was lost at sea in 1788 while still on the expedition, but was able to send its logs home.

In 1823, the whaling ship &quot;Two Brothers&quot; sank near Shark Island. This wreck was discovered in the early 21st century.

In 1841 the French Frigate Shoals were visited by the United States Exploring Expedition authorized by President Andrew Jackson. The shoals were visited by the sailing ships, brigs &quot;Oregon&quot; and &quot;Porpoise&quot;.

In 1859 the barque &quot;Gambia&quot; (a) and clipper &quot;Modern Times&quot; visited the French Frigate Shoals. That same year the whaler &quot;South Seaman&quot; wrecked on the shoals. About a dozen of its crew were rescued by another vessel in the area, but about 30 were left on the island until another ship could retrieve them. In December 1859 the brig &quot;Wanderer&quot; was also lost on the shoals, but the crew was rescued.

During the late 19th century American and European companies became interested in the possibility of mining guano in the Hawaiian Islands. U.S. Navy Lieutenant John M. Brooke, sailing on the naval schooner , formally took possession of French Frigate Shoals for the United States on 14 January 1859, in accordance with the Guano Islands Act. In 1894, French Frigate Shoals, Kure Atoll, Midway Atoll, and Pearl and Hermes Reef were leased for 25 years by the Republic of Hawaii to the North Pacific Phosphate and Fertilizer Company; however, guano and phosphate deposits at French Frigate Shoals were found to be impractical to mine. The Republic did not formally claim possession of the shoals until 13 July 1895.

French Frigate Shoals was included among the lands and waters acquired by the United States on 7 July 1898, when Hawaii became a United States territory. In 1909 it was made a part of the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation.

In 1896 the seal hunting ship &quot;Mattie E. Dyer&quot; wrecked on the shoals, and the crew abandoned ship in whaleboats. There was no water on the island they landed on among the shoals so they sailed the boats to Hawaii.

===Early 20th century===
In 1902 the Albatross expedition visited the French Frigate Shoals and studied the birds. Several naturalists visited and published an ornithological report.

In 1903 the ship &quot;Connétable de Richemont&quot; wrecked on the shoals, but its crew escaped on boats to mainland Hawaii.

In 1909 the French Frigate Shoals became part of the Hawaiian Island Reservation and administered by the United States Department of Agriculture.

In 1917 the four-masted schooner &quot;Churchill&quot; wrecked on the French Frigate Shoals. The crew of 12 survived.

The Tanager Expedition visited the French Frigate Shoals in 1923 and did a survey of the islands.

The United States Revenue Cutter Service sent many patrols to this region in the early 20th century. The U.S. Revenue Cutter Service vessel USRC &quot;Thetis&quot; visited the French Frigate Shoals in 1912, 1914, 1915, and 1916. In 1918 the shoals were inspected by the United States Navy ship USS &quot;Hermes&quot;. Shoal inspections in the 1920s and 1930s include ones by in 1924, USRC &quot;Itasca&quot; in 1931 and 1934, and the United States Coast Guard vessel in 1936.

In 1932, the minesweeper visited the shoals, anchoring near East Island. A seaplane tendered from the ship took some of the first aerial photographs of the islands.

In 1936, the seaplane tender came to the shoals, and established a base on East Island to support a month of seaplane operations.

In 1937, a member of a USN seaplane crew died at the French Frigate Shoals while his PK-1 seaplane was moored there.

===World War II===

In March 1942, Imperial Japanese Navy planners took advantage of the shoal&#x27;s isolation to use its protected waters as an anchorage and refueling point for the long-range flying boats employed in Operation K, a reconnaissance operation that aimed to disrupt salvage and repair operations following the attack on Pearl Harbor. The operation involved three IJN submarines and two Kawanishi H8K flying boats. It was the combat debut of the H8K. The H8K flying boats stopped to refuel in the shoals from two of the submarines, and . After the operation, United States Pacific Fleet Commander Chester W. Nimitz ordered a permanent United States Navy presence at the shoals.

Some U.S. Navy ships that were stationed at the Shoals in 1942 were the seaplane tender and the mine warfare ship . Over twenty flying boats were operated from the French Frigate Shoals during World War II, typically flying reconnaissance missions.

After the Battle of Midway, the United States Navy built a naval air station on Tern Island, enlarging the island sufficiently to support a landing strip, increasing its land area to . The station&#x27;s main function was as an emergency landing site for planes flying between Hawaii and Midway Atoll. French Frigate Shoals Airport comprises what remains of the original naval air station.

The ship &quot;YHB-10&quot; arrived at French Frigate Shoals in August 1942, carrying staff to help establish the naval base there. It was moored on the north side of Tern Island and used as a floating barracks. On March 26, 1945, it was sunk as a torpedo practice target near the shoals.

=== United States Coast Guard station ===

The United States Coast Guard operated a LORAN navigation station on East Island until 1952, and Tern Island until 1979. At any one time, 15 to 20 military personnel were billeted to French Frigate Shoals. As with all Coast Guard isolated duty stations, the Service attempted to fill open billets with volunteers. If there were no volunteers for essential billets, the Coast Guard would at times fill open slots as a disciplinary measure.

The LORAN station commanding officer was typically a lieutenant junior grade officer, the executive officer a chief petty officer enlisted rank. The station was staffed with USCG enlisted specialists such as Radioman, Electronic Technician, Fireman, Boatswain&#x27;s Mates, plus seaman or seaman apprentice nonrated service members (assigned to perform maintenance and other generalized duties).

The Coast Guard designated the French Frigate Shoals billet as &quot;isolated duty,&quot; thereby entitling Coast Guard members serving at the station to additional monthly &quot;isolated duty pay.&quot; Because of the billet&#x27;s remoteness, a duty term was limited to one year.

In December 1969, a tsunami devastated the islands, forcing the crew on Tern Island to evacuate the station, which was destroyed. The station was off the air from 1 to 6 December. The USCGC Kukui (WAK-186) was sent to help support repairs.

Whale-Skate Island washed away in the 1990s.

===21st century===

A United States Fish and Wildlife Service field station was active at the island from 1979 to 2012. In 2000, the atoll became part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve, which was incorporated into the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands National Monument in 2006. In 2009 the islands were evacuated during the approach of Hurricane Neki by landing a USCG C-130 on Tern&#x27;s coral airstrip.

In 2000/1 the United States Congress approved US$10 million to repair the islands, one of the major issues being that the double-wall steel sea wall around Tern Island had deteriorated and was trapping sea life such as seals. By 2004, the Army Corps of Engineers, with additional funding from the Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, conducted a US$12 million project to repair the seawall and conduct other maintenance. This project repaired 1200 feet of seawall. The project was managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. However, the budget was only enough for about half of what was needed thus leaving sections unrepaired.

In 2005, a wreck was found, possibly the wreck of the schooner &quot;Churchill&quot;, which ran aground at the French Frigate Shoals in 1917. Maritime archeologists returned in 2007 and 2008 to try and identify the wreck site, which included items like anchors and equipment.

In 2008 a shipwreck of a 19th-century whaling ship was found near Shark island. The wreck was identified in 2011 as the whaling sailing ship &quot;Two Brothers.&quot; The ship wrecked the night of February 11, 1823, under the command of Captain George Pollard Jr. (of &quot;Essex&quot; fame). The crew was able to be rescued by another whaling ship they were on the voyage with, &quot;Martha&quot;. Captain Pollard is noted for inspiring the novel &quot;Moby Dick&quot; when his sailing ship the &quot;Essex&quot; was rammed by a whale. The discovery was important in the field of maritime archeology for various reasons; there is only one surviving whaling ship from this period, and the wreck of the &quot;Two Brothers&quot; had been lost for nearly two centuries. The finding of the &quot;Two Brothers&quot; was the first discovery of a wrecked Nantucket whaling ship.

At least five other vessels are recorded to have wrecked on the French Frigate Shoals between 1859 and 1917.

In December 2012, five people were evacuated from the FFS in advance of a severe storm. They departed by boat from Tern Island and travelled back to Honolulu. The storm caused damage to some of the facilities on the island including the barracks. The US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service closed its field station on Tern Island at the end of 2012. Since then, the island has only been visited periodically.

In 2016, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ship conducted a 33-day survey expedition of the French Frigate Shoals, including reporting on the condition of the reefs.
In October 2018, Hurricane Walaka eroded away most of East Island, the second largest island of the French Frigate Shoals. About 11 acres of East Island were eliminated, which was thought to be caused by the large storm surge that Walaka caused in the area. The hurricane damaged many of the shoal&#x27;s islands, and underwater many coral reefs were stripped of sea life. Following the destruction of East Island, researchers have been forced to make camp at the smaller Tern Island when conducting field work in the French Frigate Shoals.

In 2020, the Papahanaumokuakea Marine Debris Project, working in conjunction with government agencies, removed tens of thousands of pounds of debris from the region.

In the 2020s, concerns about the decaying seawall on Tern Island trapping turtles and seals were brought to light. The double steel wall on the island has not been maintained; as a result, holes have rusted out.

In 2023 the NOAA visited the island for a research expedition along with other islands of the chain. The researchers camped on Tern Island and took trips to East Island where many turtle breeding grounds were located.

==Geology and ecology==

La Pèrouse Pinnacle, a rock outcrop in the center of the atoll, is the oldest and most remote volcanic rock in the Hawaiian chain. It stands tall and is surrounded by coral reefs. Because of its shape, the pinnacle is often mistaken for a ship from a distance.

Whale-Skate Island is a submerged island in the French Frigate Shoals. These islands suffered considerably from erosion starting in the 1960s, and by the late 1990s, Whale-Skate Island was completely washed over.

The reef system at French Frigate Shoals supports 41 species of stony corals, including several species that are not found in the main Hawaiian Island chain. More than 600 species of marine invertebrates, many of which are endemic, are found there as well.

More than 150 species of algae live among the reefs. Especially diverse algal communities are found immediately adjacent to La Pèrouse Pinnacle. This has led to speculation that an influx of additional nutrients – in the form of guano – is responsible for the diversity and productivity of algae in this environment. The reef waters support large numbers of fish. The masked angelfish (&quot;Genicanthus personatus&quot;), endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, is relatively common there. Most of Hawaii&#x27;s green sea turtles travel to the shoals to nest. The small islets of French Frigate Shoals provide refuge to the largest surviving population of Hawaiian monk seals, the second most endangered pinniped in the world.
The islands are also an important seabird colony. Eighteen species of seabird, the black-footed albatross, Laysan albatross, Bonin petrel, Bulwer&#x27;s petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Christmas shearwater, Tristram&#x27;s storm petrel, red-tailed tropicbird, masked booby, red-footed booby, brown booby, great frigatebird, spectacled tern, sooty tern, blue-gray noddy, brown noddy, black noddy and white tern nest on the islands, most of them (16) on Tern Island. Two species, the blue-gray noddy and the brown booby, nest only on La Pèrouse Pinnacle. The island also is the wintering ground for several species of shorebird.

After the Battle of Midway in WWII, Tern Island was made into an airstrip, nicknamed the &quot;coral carrier&quot; and would be between Midway Island and the main Hawaiian island. Tern Island was protected by thousands of feet of double wall steel sea wall, which has kept it stable in size. However, by 2000 the seawall was trapping marine life and Congress authorized some repair work. The seawall is noted for trapping seals because there are holes where life gets into the gap between the two walls but cannot escape. In 2023, the entrapment of seals in the decayed seawall was noted during a visit to the island.

A three-week research mission in October 2006 by the NOAA led to the discovery of 100 species never seen in the area before, including many that were new to science. The French Frigate Shoals project was part of the Census of Coral Reef Ecosystems of the Census of Marine Life. In addition to scientific analysis, a National Geographic photographer was also on board. The photographer noted the range of vibrant colors and shapes among the coral life. Jim Maragos, an expert on coral life in this region of ocean estimated they discovered 11 new species of coral.

The shark population and type was studied in 2009, and it was determined that some of the species in the area include galapagos sharks, gray reef sharks, and tiger sharks.

The activity of Tiger and Galapagos sharks at the shoals was studied, in particular their interaction with monk seal pups, though the study was hampered by a shark cull intended to protect seal pups leading to an inconclusive result. Due to a miscommunication, the study was undertaken in part to study if a shark cull would be worthwhile to protect endangered monk seals, but in fact a cull took place at the same time a study was being conducted, leading to various difficulties including that sharked that had been tracked with a transmitter could be killed. Tiger sharks are also thought to eat young albatross, and the study also explored the seasonal timing of shark activity.

Whale-Skate and Trig Islands were noted as monk seal pupping areas, though they have suffered strong erosion.

==Islands==

The three biggest islands were Tern, East, and Trig Islands. However, by the 2020s both East and Trig Island had mostly washed away. Tern and East had been home to naval and/or Coast Guard bases in the late 20th century. Since 2012, Tern Island has not been occupied but is still routinely visited for trash cleanup and research. Tern is protected by a large steel seawall built during World War II. One island that also has remained constant is La Perouse Pinnacle, which is dense volcanic rock and is also the tallest point in the group. The islands have gone through several administrative changes in the 20th century shifting from hunting area for sea turtles, to military uses, then later on more of science and nature reserve. The largest remaining island is Tern, and the pinnacle is also fixed. Other islands can be washed away by storms.

 1) Whale-Skate Island, currently a double island, is also listed in the census documents together as a block, with an area of . The shares of the islands are estimated 40% and 60%.
 2) 1971 it was reported that Near Island, although recorded on maps, would be submerged at high tide.
 3) Bare Island can be seen on satellite images but is not listed in the Census Tract&quot;.&quot; A 1971 publication says Bare Island has an area of .
 4) As of October 2018, East Island has mostly submerged.
 5) Round and Mullet Islands in census documents found together as a block 1006, together with an area of . The shares are valued according to a report from 1971 ().

The two major islands of the French Frigate shoals were Tern Island and East Island, and there is also a tall rock pinnacle. Many of the smaller islands have been washed over, and finally in 2018 East Island was largely washed away. Tern Island is protected by a seawall that originates from when it was expanded in the 1940s to become a naval air base.

Islands known to have been notably washed away or reduced by 2018 include Whale-Skate, Trig, and East Island. In the 2020s East Island is reported to be about half its former size.

===Trig Island===

Trig Island is located at 23&#x27;52&#x27;N, 166&#x27;15&#x27;, and is about 10 acres of area of which approximately have vegetation. The island is about long and between wide. However, the island is known to have weathered considerably between the 1930s and 1960s. It was surveyed several times in the 1920s and 1930s. In the early surveys it was noted as the highest of French Frigate Shoals&#x27; islands rising to above sea level. By 2018 it was mostly washed away.

===Whale-Skate Island===
Whale-Skate Island used to be two separate islands but were combined by a sand bar in the 20th century. Whale-Skate Island was about long and .

In 1923 they were surveyed as two separate islands, Whale Island and Skate Island. In the 1950s it was noted they had been connected by a sand bar several feet high.

In the 1980s, Whale-Skate Island was about , and was noted as a pupping area for seals.

=== La Perouse Pinnacle ===
La Perouse Pinnacle is a volcanic pinnacle approximately west southwest of East Island, Hawaii. It is the oldest and most remote volcanic rock in the Hawaiian Islands. La Pèrouse Pinnacle stands tall. It is surrounded by coral reefs and a shorter, rocky islet about tall. Because of its distinct shape, the pinnacle can be mistaken for a ship from a distance.

It has been called a &quot;volcanic rock islet&quot; and is known for its central position in the French Frigate Shoals between north and south sides of the atoll. The pinnacle is visible from a distance of about 8 miles (12.8 km) away at sea.

The rock is named for Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse, who came across the shoals in 1786.

The pinnacle is composed mainly of very hard basalt rock, and the island is thought to be the remains of a volcano from millions of years ago.

In 1923 on the Tanager expedition it was visited and determined to be olivine basalt rock.

The pinnacle&#x27;s resemblance to a sailing ship at distance nearly caused the wrecking of the sailing ship &quot;Rebecca&quot; in the 19th century. The whaling ship &quot;Rebecca&quot; sighted the pinnacle at nightfall, but mistook it for a sailing ship and tried to signal with it. When the signals were not returned the &quot;Rebecca&quot; headed towards the ship to investigate, but soon ran into the reef. The ship survived the encounter with the shoals, and was able to ascertain the nature of the Pinnacle in the morning.

<text>The yellow-billed shrike (Lanius corvinus) is a large passerine bird in the shrike family. It is sometimes known as the long-tailed shrike, but this is to be discouraged, since it invites confusion with the long-tailed shrike, &quot;Lanius schach&quot;, of tropical southern Asia. The yellow-billed shrike is a common resident breeding bird in tropical Africa from Senegal eastwards to Uganda and locally in westernmost Kenya. It frequents forest and other habitats with trees.

==Description==
The yellow-billed shrike is with a long, graduating tail and short wings. The adult has mottled brown upperparts and streaked buff underparts. It has a brown eye mask and a rufous wing patch, and the bill is yellow. Sexes are largely similar, but females have maroon patches on the flanks, while males have rufous parches; these patches are only visible when the bird is in flight, displaying, engaging in territorial disputes, or preening. Immature birds show buff fringes to the wing feathers. The legs and feet are black, and the beak is yellow, even in juveniles. It is a noisy bird, with harsh &quot;swee-swee&quot; and &quot;dreee-too&quot; calls.

==Distribution==
The species is resident in tropical Africa, south of the Sahara and north of the equator, but is not present in the Horn of Africa. It is present in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, and Uganda. It makes localised movements, but these have been little studied.

==Ecology==
This is a conspicuous and gregarious bird and a cooperative breeder, always seen in groups, often lined up on telephone wires. The nest is a cup structure in a bush or tree into which four or five eggs are laid. Only one female in a group breeds at a given time, with other members providing protection and food.

The yellow-billed shrike feeds on insects, which it locates from prominent look-out perches in trees, wires, or posts. They also sometimes eat small frogs, reptiles, and mice, but are not known to eat other birds or to form larders.

==Status==
&quot;C. corvina&quot; is common in some areas and less so in others. No evidence has been found of any substantial decline in its populations, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern.

<text>Coronie is a district of Suriname, situated on the coast. Coronie&#x27;s capital city is Totness. The district border the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the Surinamese district of Saramacca to the east, the Surinamese district of Sipaliwini to the south and the Surinamese district of Nickerie to the west. The district is served by the Totness Airstrip.

The district has a population of 3,391 and an area of 3,902 km2, making it the least-populated district of Suriname.

==History==
The first plantations were established from 1808 onwards by English and Scottish colonists. Coronie became an independent district in 1851. The oldest plantation in the district is Burnside. Coronie was isolated and it was not until the 1940s, that a road was built linking Totness with Paramaribo, which is nowadays part of the East-West Link.

In September 1965, four sounding rockets of Apache type with a maximum altitude of 205 km were launched. The rockets were launched as part as an investigation into the workings of the jet stream. The project was carried out by University of Utrecht and Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute. NASA provided the rockets.

Totness has been designated as a regional centre in the beginning of the 21st century, and is planned to be upgrade with a medium-sized hotel and a proper city centre. The area from Clyde to Burnside has no electricity, or telephone.

==Economy==
Coronie, as with most of Suriname, relies mostly upon agriculture for both its income and its food supply. The coastal environment made it a suitable are for coconut and rice plantations. In the late 20th century, rice became a major agricultural crop. The rice fields are suited in the south and along the East-West Link.

The flat and muddy coast with shallow waters prevented the construction of major harbors and large ships had to anchor miles off shores and transfer their passengers and cargo to little boats.

== Resorts ==

Coronie is divided into 3 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Johanna Maria
* Totness
* Welgelegen

== Villages ==
Other villages in Coronie are:
* Friendship
* Jenny
* Mary&#x27;s Hope

==Nature reserves==
Coronie is home to three protected areas. The Peruvia Nature Reserve which was established in 1986 and covers 31,000 hectares, the Bigi Pan nature reserve which was established in 1987 and covers 67,000 hectares, and the protected area which was established in 1987 and covers 27,200 hectares.

<text>Ninhydrin (2,2-dihydroxyindane-1,3-dione) is an organic compound with the formula C6H4(CO)2C(OH)2. It is used to detect ammonia and amines. Upon reaction with these amines, ninhydrin gets converted into deep blue or purple derivatives, which are called Ruhemann&#x27;s purple. Ninhydrin is most commonly used to detect fingerprints in forensic cases, as the terminal amines of lysine residues in peptides and proteins sloughed off in fingerprints react with ninhydrin.

Ninhydrin is a white solid that is soluble in ethanol and acetone. Ninhydrin can be considered as the hydrate of indane-1,2,3-trione.

== History ==
Ninhydrin was discovered in 1910 by the German-English chemist Siegfried Ruhemann (1859–1943). In the same year, Ruhemann observed ninhydrin&#x27;s reaction with amino acids. In 1954, Swedish investigators Oden and von Hofsten proposed that ninhydrin could be used to develop latent fingerprints.

==Uses==
Ninhydrin can be used in Kaiser test to monitor deprotection in solid phase peptide synthesis. The chain is linked via its C-terminus to the solid support, with the N-terminus extending off it. When that nitrogen is deprotected, a ninhydrin test yields blue. Amino-acid residues are attached with their N-terminus protected, so if the next residue has been successfully coupled onto the chain, the test gives a colorless or yellow result.

Ninhydrin is also used in qualitative analysis of proteins. Most of the amino acids, except proline, are hydrolyzed and react with ninhydrin. Also, certain amino acid chains are degraded. Therefore, separate analysis is required for identifying such amino acids that either react differently or do not react with ninhydrin at all. The rest of the amino acids are then quantified colorimetrically after separation by chromatography.

A solution suspected of containing the ammonium ion can be tested by ninhydrin by dotting it onto a solid support (such as silica gel); treatment with ninhydrin should result in a dramatic purple color if the solution contains this species. In the analysis of a chemical reaction by thin layer chromatography (TLC), the reagent can also be used (usually 0.2% solution in either n-butanol or in ethanol). It will detect, on the TLC plate, virtually all amines, carbamates and also, after vigorous heating, amides.

Upon reaction with ninhydrin, amino acids undergo decarboxylation. The released CO2 originates from the carboxyl carbon of the amino acid. This reaction has been used to release the carboxyl carbons of bone collagen from ancient bones for stable isotope analysis in order to help reconstruct the palaeodiet of cave bears. Release of the carboxyl carbon (via ninhydrin) from amino acids recovered from soil that has been treated with a labeled substrate demonstrates assimilation of that substrate into microbial protein. This approach was successfully used to reveal that some ammonium oxidizing bacteria, also called nitrifying bacteria use urea as a carbon source in soil.

===Forensics===
A ninhydrin solution is commonly used by forensic investigators in the analysis of latent fingerprints on porous surfaces such as paper. The amino acids present in the minute sweat secretions that gather on the finger&#x27;s unique ridges transfer to surfaces that are touched. Exposure of the surface to ninhydrin converts the amino acids into visibly colored products and thus reveals the print. The test solutions suffer from poor long-term stability, especially if not kept cold.

To further enhance the ability of ninhydrin, a solution of 1,2-indandione and zinc chloride (IND-Zn) can be used prior to ninhydrin. This sequence leads to greater overall reaction of the amino acids, possibly by IND-Zn helping to release them from the surface for the subsequent ninhydrin reaction.

==Reactivity==
Ninhydrin exists in equilibrium with the triketone indane-1,2,3-trione, which reacts readily with nucleophiles (including water). Whereas for most carbonyl compounds, a carbonyl form is more stable than a product of water addition (hydrate), ninhydrin forms a stable hydrate of the central carbon because of the destabilizing effect of the adjacent carbonyl groups.

To generate the ninhydrin chromophore [2-(1,3-dioxoindan-2-yl)iminoindane-1,3-dione], the amine must condense to give a Schiff base. The reaction of ninhydrin with secondary amines gives an iminium salt, which is also coloured, generally being yellow–orange.

==Effects on health==
Ninhydrin may cause allergic, IgE-mediated rhinitis and asthma. A case has been described in which a 41 year old forensic laboratory worker working with Ninhydrin developed rhinitis and respiratory difficulty. Her specific IgE levels were found almost doubled.

<text>Arthur Nebe (; 13 November 1894 – 21 March 1945) was a German SS functionary who held key positions in the security and police apparatus of Nazi Germany and was, from 1941, a major perpetrator of the Holocaust.

Nebe rose through the ranks of the Prussian police force to become head of Nazi Germany&#x27;s Criminal Police (&quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot;; Kripo) in 1936, which was amalgamated into the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) in 1939. Before the 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union, Nebe volunteered to serve as the commanding officer of &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot;, one of the four mobile death squads of the SS. The unit was deployed in the Army Group Centre Rear Area, in modern-day Belarus; it reported over 45,000 victims by November 1941. In late 1941, Nebe was posted back to Berlin and resumed his career with the RSHA. Nebe commanded the Kripo until he was denounced and executed after the failed attempt to kill Adolf Hitler in July 1944.

After the war, Nebe&#x27;s career and involvement with the 20 July plot against Hitler were the subject of several apologetic accounts by surviving members of the plot, who portrayed him as a professional policeman and a dedicated anti-Nazi. These portrayals have since been discredited by historians who describe him as an opportunist and a mass murderer driven by racism and careerism.

==Before World War II==

===Police career===

Born in Berlin in 1894, the son of a school teacher, Nebe volunteered for military service during World War I and served with distinction. In 1920, he joined the Berlin detective force, the &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Kripo; Criminal Police). He attained the rank of police inspector in 1923 and police commissioner in 1924.

Nebe was a conservative nationalist, who embraced the shift of the country to right-wing rule in the 1930s. In July 1931, he joined the Nazi Party (party number 574,307) and the SS (SS number 280,152). Nebe became the Nazis&#x27; liaison in the criminal police in Berlin, with links to an early Berlin SS group led by Kurt Daluege. In early 1932, Nebe and other Nazi detectives formed the NS (National Socialist) Civil Service Society of the Berlin Police. In 1933, he came to know Hans Bernd Gisevius, then an official in the Berlin Police Headquarters; after the war, Gisevius produced an apologetic account of Nebe&#x27;s Nazi era activities. In 1935, Nebe was appointed head of the Prussian Criminal Police. He obtained the rank of SS-&quot;Gruppenführer&quot; and &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; of Police on 9 November 1941.

===Head of National Criminal Police===

In July 1936, the Prussian Criminal Police became the central criminal investigation department for Germany, the &quot;Reichskriminalpolizeiamt&quot; (Reich Criminal Police Office or RKPA). It was amalgamated, along with the secret state police, the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Gestapo), into the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo), with Reinhard Heydrich in overall command. Nebe was appointed head of the RKPA, reporting to Heydrich. The addition of the Kripo to Heydrich&#x27;s control helped cement the foundations of the Nazi police state. It also led to an &quot;overlap&quot; of personnel from the SD, Gestapo and Kripo in leadership positions in the police and security forces in Germany.

On 27 September 1939, Himmler ordered the creation of the Reich Security Main Office (&quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; or RSHA); the new organisation encompassed the intelligence service, security services, secret state and criminal police. The RSHA was divided into several main departments, including the Kripo, which became Department V of the RSHA. Kripo&#x27;s stated mission, which Nebe embraced, was to &quot;exterminate criminality&quot;. Under his leadership, equipped with arbitrary powers of arrest and detention, the Kripo acted more and more like the Gestapo, including the liberal use of so-called protective custody and large-scale roundups of &quot;asocials&quot;.

In 1939, Nebe lent a commissioner of his Criminal Police Office, Christian Wirth of Stuttgart, to the Action T4, which ran the programme of involuntary euthanasia (murder) of the disabled. Also in 1939, as head of Kripo, he was involved in the discussions of the upcoming campaigns against the Sinti and Roma. Nebe wanted to include sending Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Gypsies&quot; to the planned reservations for the Jews and others in the east. In October 1939, he ordered Adolf Eichmann to put Sinti and Roma with Jews on the transports to occupied Poland under the &quot;Nisko Plan&quot;. In November, Nebe interrogated Georg Elser after Elser&#x27;s failed assassination attempt on Hitler, concluding that Elser was telling the truth when he claimed that he was working alone.

==World War II==

===&quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot;===

Just before the 1941 Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mobile death squads, which had previously operated in Poland, were reformed and placed once again under the overall command of Reinhard Heydrich. Nebe volunteered to command &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot;, an SS death squad that operated in the Army Group Center Rear Area as the invasion progressed. The unit&#x27;s task was to exterminate Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot;, such as communists, &quot;Gypsies&quot;, &quot;Asiatics&quot;, the disabled, and psychiatric hospital patients in the territories that the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had overrun. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; also shot hostages and prisoners of war handed over by the army for execution.

====Mass killing operations====

Around 5 July 1941, Nebe consolidated &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; near Minsk, establishing a headquarters and remaining there for two months. The murders progressed apace. In a 13 July Operational Situation Report, Nebe stated that 1,050 Jews had been killed in Minsk, also noting that the liquidation of the Jews was underway in Vilna where 500 Jews were shot daily. In the same report, Nebe remarked: &quot;only 96 Jews were executed in Grodno and Lida during the first days. I gave orders to intensify these activities&quot;. He reported that the killings were being brought into smooth running order and that the shootings were carried out &quot;at an increasing rate&quot;. The report also announced that his &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; was now killing non-Jews in Minsk.

In the 23 July report, Nebe advanced the idea of a &quot;solution to the Jewish problem&quot; being &quot;impractical&quot; in his assigned area of operation due to &quot;the overwhelming number of the Jews&quot;; i.e. there were too many Jews to be killed by too few men. By August 1941, Nebe came to realize that his &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot;&#x27;s resources were insufficient to meet the expanded mandate of the killing operations, resulting from the inclusion of Jewish women and children since that month.

====New killing methods====

In August 1941, Himmler, after a visit to Minsk, decided that alternative methods of killing should be found, instead of mass-shootings. He told Heydrich that he was concerned about the SS men&#x27;s mental health. Himmler turned to Nebe to devise a more &quot;convenient&quot; method of killing, particularly one that would spare executioners elements of their grisly task. Murder with carbon monoxide gas, already in use in the Reich as part of the &quot;euthanasia&quot; program, was contemplated, but deemed too cumbersome for the mobile killing operations in the occupied Soviet Union.

Nebe decided to try experimenting by murdering Soviet psychiatric patients, first with explosives near Minsk, and then with automobile exhaust at Mogilev. The idea of using gas was partly inspired by an incident in Nebe&#x27;s past. One night after a party, Nebe had driven home drunk, parked in his garage, and fallen asleep with the engine running, nearly dying of carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust fumes. To conduct the experiments, he ordered the SS chemist Albert Widmann, a member of the criminal-technical institute of the RKPA, to come to Minsk with of explosives and exhaust hoses. The next day, Widmann, Nebe, and an explosives expert carried out their first experiment in prepared bunkers in the Minsk area. According to testimony presented at Widmann&#x27;s postwar trial:

Two days later, Nebe and Widmann carried out another killing experiment: five psychiatric patients from Mogilev were placed in a hermetically sealed room with pipes leading to the outside. At first, exhausts from a passenger vehicle were vented into the room, so that the carbon monoxide would kill those inside. This method failed to kill the patients, so a truck was added; the patients were dead within 15 minutes. Nebe and Widmann concluded that killing with explosives was impractical, while gassing &quot;held promise&quot;, as vehicles were readily available and could be used as needed.

After these experimental killings, Nebe thought of remodelling a vehicle with a hermetically sealed cabin for killing. The carbon monoxide from the vehicle&#x27;s exhaust would be channelled into the sealed cabin in which the victims stood. He discussed the idea&#x27;s technical aspects with a specialist from Kripo&#x27;s Technology Institute and together they brought the proposal to Heydrich, who approved it.

====Mogilev conference and escalation of violence====

The &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;″s aggressive rear security doctrine and the use of the &quot;security threat&quot; to disguise genocidal policies resulted in a close cooperation between the army and the security apparatus behind the front lines. Nebe, as the &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; commander, participated in a three-day field conference at Mogilev in late September 1941. Organised by General Max von Schenckendorff, chief of Army Group Centre&#x27;s rear area, the conference was to serve as an &quot;exchange of experiences&quot; for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; rear unit commanders.

Participating officers were selected on the basis of their &quot;achievements and experiences&quot; in security operations already undertaken. In addition to Nebe, the speakers included Higher SS and Police Leader Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski; Max Montua, commander of Police Regiment Centre; Hermann Fegelein, commander of the SS Cavalry Brigade; and Gustav Lombard, commander of the 1st SS Cavalry Regiment in Fegelein&#x27;s brigade. Nebe&#x27;s talk focused on the SD&#x27;s role in the common fight against &quot;partisans&quot; and &quot;plunderers&quot;. He also covered the &quot;Jewish question&quot; and its connection to the suppression of resistance movements in occupied territories. After the conference, a 16-page executive summary was distributed to the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; troops and Order Police battalions in the rear area. There was a dramatic increase in atrocities against Jews and other civilians in the last three months of 1941.

Under Nebe&#x27;s command, &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; committed public hangings to terrorise the local population. Nebe&#x27;s report dated 9 October 1941 stated that, due to suspected partisan activity near Demidov, all male residents aged 15 to 55 were put in a camp to be screened. Seventeen people were identified as &quot;partisans&quot; and &quot;Communists&quot; and five were hanged in front of 400 local residents assembled to watch; the rest were shot. Through 14 November 1941, &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; reported the killing of 45,467 people; thereafter, Nebe returned to Berlin and resumed his duties as head of the Kripo.

===President of Interpol and Stalag Luft III murders===

Following the 1942 assassination of Heydrich, Nebe assumed the additional post of President of the International Criminal Police Commission, the organization today known as Interpol, in June 1942. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in 1938, the organization had fallen under the control of Nazi Germany and was headed by Heydrich until his death. Nebe served in this capacity until June 1943, when he was replaced by Ernst Kaltenbrunner.

In March 1944, after the &quot;Great Escape&quot; from Stalag Luft III prisoner-of-war camp, Nebe was ordered by Heinrich Müller, Chief of the Gestapo, to select and kill 50 of the 73 recaptured prisoners in what became known as the &quot;Stalag Luft III murders&quot;. Also in 1944, Nebe suggested that the Roma interned at Auschwitz would be good subjects for medical experiments at the Dachau concentration camp, after Himmler had asked Ernst-Robert Grawitz, a high-ranking SS physician, for advice.

===1944 plot against Adolf Hitler===

Nebe was involved in the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler; he was to lead a team of 12 policemen to kill Himmler, but the signal to act never reached him. After the failed assassination attempt, Nebe fled and went into hiding. He was arrested in January 1945 after a former mistress betrayed him. Nebe was sentenced to death by the People&#x27;s Court on 2 March and, according to official records, was executed in Berlin at Plötzensee Prison on 21 March 1945 by being hanged from a meat hook, in accordance with Hitler&#x27;s order that the bomb plotters were to be &quot;hanged like cattle&quot;.

==Assessment==

Historians have a negative view of Nebe and his motives, despite his participation in the 20 July plot. Robert Gellately writes that Nebe&#x27;s views were virulently racist and antisemitic. Martin Kitchen casts Nebe as an opportunist, who saw the SS as the police force of the future, and as an &quot;energetic and enthusiastic mass murderer, who seized every opportunity to undertake yet another massacre.&quot; Yet, according to Kitchen, he &quot;was clearly unable to stand the strain and was posted back to Berlin.&quot;

Comprehensive reports filed by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were analyzed by historian Ronald Headland in his 1992 book &quot;Messages of Murder&quot;. These documents provide insights into its leadership&#x27;s worldview. Headland writes that the reports &quot;bear witness to the fanatic commitment of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; leaders to their mission of extermination&quot;; their ideology and racism are evident in the &quot;constant debasement of the victims&quot; and &quot;ever present racial conceptions concerning Jews, Communists, Gypsies and other &#x27;inferior&#x27; elements&quot;. Headland concludes that Nebe was an ambitious man who may have volunteered to lead an &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; unit for careerist reasons, to curry favor with Heydrich. Any misgivings he may have entertained as to the feasibility of the undertaking failed to prevent him from overseeing the murder of close to 50,000 people in the five months Nebe commanded his unit.

Gerald Reitlinger describes Nebe&#x27;s reasons for joining the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; as &quot;placation&quot; and a desire to hold on to his position in the Criminal Police Department, where, since 1934, Gestapo men were gaining influence, and which was later taken over by Heydrich. Reitlinger writes: &quot;If Nebe did in fact retain his office till 1944, it was because of the five months he spent in Russia, or, as his friend Gisevius politely referred to, &#x27;at the front&#x27;.&quot; Reitlinger calls Nebe a &quot;very questionable member&quot; of the German military resistance at the time of the 20 July bomb plot.

Alex J. Kay writes that &quot;the role, character and motivation of those involved both in planning—and in some cases carrying out—mass murder and in the conspiracy against Hitler deserve to be investigated more closely&quot;. He places Nebe in this category, with Franz Halder, chief of staff of the Army High Command (OKH), and Georg Thomas, head of the Defence, Economy and Armament Office in the Armed Forces High Command (OKW).

===Apologetics===

Several apologetic accounts produced by the conspirators behind the 20 July plot described Nebe as a professional police officer and a dedicated member of the German resistance. In 1947, Hans Bernd Gisevius described Nebe&#x27;s position at the head of &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; B as a &quot;brief command at the front&quot;; Gisevius changed his story in the 1960s, when Nebe&#x27;s role with the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; was exposed. In the 1966 work &quot;Wo ist Nebe?&quot; (&quot;Where is Nebe?&quot;), Gisevius claimed that Nebe was reluctant to accept the posting, but had been persuaded to take it by the opposition leaders Hans Oster and Ludwig Beck, who had allegedly wanted Nebe to retain a key role in Heydrich&#x27;s apparatus. Gisevius also claimed that Nebe exaggerated the number of victims in reports to Berlin by adding a zero to the number of those killed. A Swedish police official active in Interpol during the war years, Harry Söderman, described Nebe and , a key RSHA figure responsible for persecution of the Roma, in his 1956 book as &quot;professional policemen... very mild Nazis&quot;.

The historian Christian Gerlach, writing about the 20 July conspirators and their complicity in war crimes of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, calls Nebe a &quot;notorious mass murderer&quot;. He discusses the role of Henning von Tresckow and his adjutant, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, who were members of the military opposition to Hitler, and writes:

Gerlach doubts that Nebe falsified &quot;Einsatzgruppe B&quot; reports and puts Schlabrendorff&#x27;s claims in the context of bomb plotters&#x27; memoirs and the then-prevalent assessments of the opposition group within the high command of Army Group Center: &quot;Especially with reference to the murder of the Jews, [it is said that] &#x27;the SS&#x27; had deceived the officers by killing in secret, filing incomplete reports or none at all; if general staff officers protested, the SS threatened them.&quot; Gerlach concludes: &quot;This is, of course, nonsense.&quot;

The historian Waitman Wade Beorn writes that &quot;some have argued that [Nebe] deliberately inflated the numbers of Jews he reported killed; yet all evidence indicates that he was quite content to play his role in Nazi genocide and that his subsequent displeasure with the regime may have stemmed from the imminent Nazi defeat, but not opposition to the Holocaust&quot;. Bernhard Wehner, Nebe&#x27;s former colleague at the Kripo stated that &quot;Nebe was worried the Allies would punish him for his crimes&quot; - his only reason for joining the resistance.

<text>Marowijne () is a district of Suriname, located on the north-east coast. Marowijne&#x27;s capital city is Albina, with other towns including Moengo and Wanhatti. The district borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, French Guiana to the east, the Surinamese district of Sipaliwini to the south, and the Surinamese districts of Commewijne and Para to the west.

Marowijne&#x27;s population is 18,294 and the district has an area of 4,627 km2.

==History==
Marowijne is also home to many Maroon &quot;palenques.&quot; The Maroons are descendants of slaves who escaped from their Dutch masters centuries ago, particularly slaves who escaped from Suriname&#x27;s huge plantations during the 18th century. They established autonomy for their interior settlements by a 1760 peace treaty with the Netherlands, which was unable to conquer them.

Albina was founded on 13 December 1845 by August Kappler, and was named after his wife. Albina is located near the border with French Guiana. It is the main city, and the largest area which is not tribal.

During the early 20th century, bauxite was discovered in Marowijne district, leading to a boom in mining that significantly enriched the entire country. The bauxite industry resulted in the growth of Moengo which is as of 2020, the largest town in the district.

On 22 July 1986, the Surinamese Interior War started. That night, the Jungle Commando led by Ronnie Brunswijk, captured the check post near Stolkertsijver, and opened fire on the army barracks in Albina. The civil war which followed led to the massacre of Moiwana where 35 civilians including women and children were killed by the National Army led by Dési Bouterse, and large scale destruction in Albina and Moengo. The civil war also resulted in a refugee crisis into French Guiana.

The district also has a large tourism industry and is the location of ocean front resorts in Galibi, which is inhabited by an indigenous population.

The main road for Marowijne is the East-West Link. The distance between Paramaribo and Albina is about .

==Health care==
Four health cares centre are located in the District, and there is a regional medical centre in Albina which qualifies as a minor hospital, however specialised health care has to be performed in Paramaribo or French Guiana. In corporation with the French Development Agency and the Inter-American Development Bank a hospital is under construction in Albina.

==Resorts==

Marowijne is divided into six resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Albina (integral part of Suriname)
* Galibi (indigenous area)
* Moengo (Maroon autonomous area)
* Moengotapoe (Maroon autonomous area)
* Patamacca (Maroon autonomous area)
* Wanhatti (Maroon autonomous area)
