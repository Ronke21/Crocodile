<text>Donald Paul Bellisario (born August 8, 1935) is an American television producer and screenwriter who created and wrote episodes for the TV series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; (1980–1988), &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; (1982–1983), &quot;Airwolf&quot; (1984–1987), &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; (1989–1993), &quot;JAG&quot; (1995–2005), and &quot;NCIS&quot; (2003–present). 
==Early life==
Bellisario was born in Cokeburg, Pennsylvania, on August 8, 1935, to an Italian-American father, and a Serbian-American mother. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1959, and attained the rank of sergeant. According to Bellisario, he encountered—and nearly got into a fight with—Lee Harvey Oswald in 1958 at a supply shed at Marine Air Control Squadron 9 because Oswald was reading &quot;Pravda&quot;, which offended Bellisario.

Bellisario earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism at Pennsylvania State University in 1961.

Bellisario became an advertising copywriter in Lancaster, Pennsylvania in 1965, and three years later became creative director of the Bloom Agency in Dallas, Texas. Upon rising to senior vice president after eight years, he then moved to Hollywood to pursue screenwriting and production.

==Career==
After working under such television producers as Glen A. Larson and Stephen J. Cannell, Bellisario adopted some of their production techniques, for example, using a small pool of actors for his many productions. He created or co-created the TV series &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;; &quot;Airwolf&quot;; &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;; &quot;JAG&quot;; and &quot;NCIS&quot;. He was a writer and producer on &quot;Black Sheep Squadron&quot; and the original &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. He wrote and directed the 1988 feature film &quot;Last Rites&quot;. 

Many of Bellisario&#x27;s protagonists are current or former members of the United States Armed Forces. Tom Selleck&#x27;s character in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; was a United States Naval Academy graduate, former Naval Intelligence officer and Vietnam veteran; Jan-Michael Vincent&#x27;s character in &quot;Airwolf&quot; was a Vietnam veteran; Commander Harmon &quot;Harm&quot; Rabb, Jr., the main character of &quot;JAG&quot;, was a Naval Academy graduate and former Naval Aviator; and &quot;NCIS&quot;s main character, Leroy Jethro Gibbs, is a retired Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and Scout Sniper; Jake Cutter (Stephen Collins) from &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot; was a former Flying Tigers pilot; and Albert &quot;Al&quot; Calavicci in &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; was a former Naval Aviator, Vietnam prisoner of war and rear admiral. Several of his main characters share August 8 as their birthday.

Bellisario received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2004, which was shown in a Season 9 &quot;JAG&quot; episode, &quot;Trojan Horse&quot;. In an interview with Sci-Fi Channel in the late 1990s, Bellisario said he was inspired to create &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; in 1988 after reading a novel about time travel. His service alongside John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, was the basis for the &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; fifth season double-length episode &quot;Lee Harvey Oswald&quot; (originally aired September 22, 1992).

Bellisario retired in 2007, after widely reported tension with star Mark Harmon ended with the former&#x27;s departure from &quot;NCIS&quot;. Although he retains the title of executive producer, he has not had any real creative or executive involvement with &quot;NCIS&quot; since then. Bellisario later sued CBS over the creation of &quot;&quot;, arguing his contract with the network entitled him to the first rights to create any &quot;NCIS&quot; spin off, as well as some share of profits from the new show. The suit was settled before trial in 2011 for an undisclosed amount.

Bellisario&#x27;s production company was named &quot;Belisarius Productions&quot; after the Roman general Belisarius, as &quot;Bellisario&quot; is an Italian-language variant of &quot;Belisarius&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bellisario married Margaret Schaffran in 1956 and they divorced in 1974. They had four children, Joy Bellisario-Jenkins (born c. 1956), David Bellisario (1957–2020) a producer on &quot;&quot;, Leslie Bellisario-Ingham (born c. 1961), and Julie Bellisario-Watson (producer on &quot;NCIS&quot;). 

Bellisario married Lynn Halpern in 1979 and they divorced in 1984. They had a son, Michael Bellisario, born on April 7, 1980. Michael had a recurring role as Midshipman Michael Roberts on &quot;JAG&quot; and played Charles &quot;Chip&quot; Sterling on &quot;NCIS&quot;. 

He married Deborah Pratt, known for her character in Bellisario&#x27;s &quot;Airwolf&quot;, in 1984 and they divorced in 1991. They had two children, Troian (born October 28, 1985) and Nicholas (born August 27, 1991). Troian portrayed Sarah McGee on &quot;NCIS&quot;, Teresa on &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, and Erin on &quot;JAG&quot;, but has become best known for her 2010–2017 role as Spencer Hastings on &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, a series her father did not produce. 

Bellisario married Vivienne Murray (née Lee), on November 27, 1998. He gained two stepsons from the marriage, Chad and Sean Murray, the latter an actor who plays Timothy McGee on &quot;NCIS&quot;. 

==Philanthropy and awards==
In 2001, Penn State named Bellisario a Distinguished Alumnus, the highest honor bestowed on a graduate.

In 2006, Bellisario endowed a $1 million Trustee Matching Scholarship in the Penn State College of Communications. He recalled:
On October 27, 2016, he received a Visionary Award at the UCLA Neurosurgery Visionary Ball.

On April 21, 2017, the Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees voted to rename the College of Communications the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications in recognition of a $30 million endowment from Bellisario. The donation is one of the largest gifts in Penn State history.

<text>In cricket, a bye is a type of extra. It is a run scored by the batting team when the ball has not been hit by the batter and the ball has not hit the batter&#x27;s body.

==Scoring byes==
Usually, if the ball passes the batter without being deflected, the wicket-keeper will catch it. This normally prevents the scoring of runs because the batters will be unable to complete a run before being stumped or run out by the wicket-keeper. However, if the wicket-keeper fumbles or misses the ball, the batters may be able to score runs safely. These runs are scored as byes: they are added to the team&#x27;s total, but not to the numbers of runs scored by either batter.

If the wicket-keeper misses the ball and it travels all the way to the boundary, the batting team scores four byes, just as if the batter had hit the ball to the boundary for four runs. In the virtually impossible case that a bouncer bounces so high that it flies directly over the boundary without touching the ground, only 4 byes are awarded.

If the ball was a wide, any extras are scored as wides and not as byes.

Whereas wides and no-balls are considered to be the fault of the bowler, and are considered negative statistics in a bowler&#x27;s record, byes are considered to be the fault of the wicket-keeper, and are considered negatively against the wicket-keeper&#x27;s record. However, some playing conditions make byes more likely, regardless of a wicket-keeper&#x27;s ability – wayward fast bowling, or an uneven pitch, or the need for the keeper to stand directly behind the stumps.

Byes are relatively rare in one-day cricket, usually making the smallest component of extras in a score. This is because the batter is more likely to attempt to hit the ball. They are far more prominent in first-class cricket. For example, in the Test series between Australia and England in 2010–11, there were 258 extras in five matches, of which 76 were byes (29.4% of the extras). In the seven one-day and T20 matches that followed between the same sides, there were 262 extras, of which only 10 were byes (3.8% of the extras).

Normally batters never attempt to run byes when the wicket-keeper catches the ball. However, in situations at the end of a game when the batting team must score runs quickly in order to have a chance of winning, the batters may risk running a bye and hope that the wicket-keeper fumbles the ball or throws it inaccurately when attempting to run a batter out. The usual result of this is a batter&#x27;s being run out, but sometimes the tactic pays off with a few One Day International matches, and at least one Test, having been won on byes.

==Scoring notation==

The conventional notation for a single bye is a triangle with a horizontal edge at the base and a point at the top. If more than one bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle.

== Records ==
The Test wicket-keeper who has conceded least byes per Test (out of all those who have played 10 tests or more) is Denis Lindsay, with 20 byes conceded in the 15 Tests in which he kept wicket; most of the best keepers in this regard have averaged around 3 or 4 byes per Test. Lindsay conceded no byes at all in his last four Tests.

==Umpire&#x27;s signal==
The umpire signals byes by raising his arm into a vertical position, the palm of his hand open to distinguish between the signal for byes and out.

<text>Ladywood is an inner-city district next to central Birmingham. Historically in Warwickshire, in June 2004, Birmingham City Council conducted a citywide &quot;Ward Boundary Revision&quot; to round-up the 39 Birmingham wards to 40. As a result of this, Ladywood Ward&#x27;s boundaries were expanded to include the neighbouring areas of Hockley, Lee Bank and Birmingham city centre.

== Demographics ==
At the time of the 2001 Population Census, 23,789 people were living in the Ladywood Ward. The population density was 3,330 people per km2 living within its 7.1 km2 boundary, compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. Nearly half of the population of Ladywood (49%) consisted of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. The largest ethnic minority groups were Afro-Caribbean at 13.18%, Indian at 11.65%, Pakistani at 10.64% and Mixed Race at 5.52%.

==Housing and land use==
The Ladywood ward combines areas of varying land-use, such that no generalisation is possible. There is the city centre (the economically valuable Central business district), the affluent Jewellery Quarter, and Broad Street areas which have become fashionable for &quot;luxury flat&quot; living, the Lee Bank area (now known as Park Central) which has been fully redeveloped, and there is the remainder of the ward, which is Ladywood itself (here referred to as &quot;remainder Ladywood&quot; – i.e., what is Ladywood itself) which is relatively economically impoverished.

Most of &quot;remainder Ladywood&quot; was redeveloped during the 1960s, with decaying terraced slums being cleared to make way for new low-rise housing and high-rise flats. Although the newer homes were an improvement on their predecessors in terms of quality and sanitation, social problems became prevalent in much of the local area including car crime, drug dealing, anti-social behaviour and many of the other problems commonly associated with inner city areas across England.

More than 20 multi-storey blocks of council flats were built around Ladywood during the 1960s and 1970s; however, six of them were demolished in the early 2000s.

More recently there has been investment in physical improvements to the area. Some tower blocks have been either demolished or improved, not least with introduction of concierge or CCTV security systems. These and other such measures may have resulted in a reduction of antisocial behaviour.

There are plans to build high-density housing, possibly over 1,100 units, on 54 acres of derelict industrial land at Icknield Port. The proposals include old-style back-to-backs with internal courtyards raising fears of future slums.

The area is served by two libraries; Spring Hill Library and Ladywood Library.

== Politics ==
The ward is currently represented by two Labour councillors at the Birmingham City Council: Sir Albert Bore and Kath Hartley.

Ladywood Ward has adopted a &quot;Committee Manager&quot; and an &quot;Interim Neighbourhood Manager&quot;. These are Kay Thomas and Sandra Lawrence respectively.

== Notable residents ==
* Walter Herbert Allcott (1889-1951), painter, born in Ladywood.
* Washington Irving (1783–1859), American writer. Inspired to write while living with family in Birmingham.
* Alfred Joseph Knight (1888–1960), World War I Victoria Cross recipient.
*J.R.R. Tolkien (1892–1973), author and academic lived in an area of Edgbaston now taken over by the extension of the Ladywood Ward boundaries.
*Dorian Yates (b. 1962), IFBB Professional Bodybuilder and 6 x Mr. Olympia.

<doc id="667267" wikidata="Q6592103" url="?curid=667267" title="List of New Zealand by-elections">
<text>By-elections in New Zealand occur to fill vacant seats in the House of Representatives. The death, resignation, or expulsion of a sitting electorate MP can cause a by-election. (Note that list MPs do not have geographic districts for the purpose of provoking by-elections – if a list MP&#x27;s seat becomes vacant, the next person on his or her party&#x27;s list fills the position.) Historically, by-elections were often caused by general elections being declared void.

==Background==
Under the Electoral Act 1993, a by-election need not take place if a general election will occur within six months of an electorate seat becoming vacant, although confirmation by a resolution supported by at least 75% of MPs is required. In 1996 the general election date was brought forward slightly, to 12 October, to avoid a by-election after the resignation of Michael Laws. Twice, in 1943 and 1969, by-elections were avoided after the deaths in election years of Paraire Karaka Paikea and Ralph Hanan by passing special acts, the By-election Postponement Act 1943 and the By-election Postponement Act 1969.

In recent years by-elections have not occurred particularly frequently – only one in the 2002–2005 parliamentary term, and none in the 1999–2002 or 2005–2008 terms. This is because most MPs who retire mid-term (e.g. Labour MPs Jim Sutton and Michael Cullen) were List MPs, so are simply replaced by the next member below them on their party list (unless that person is already an electorate MP, or does not agree). Some MPs have entered Parliament when two or more people above them on the list have declined, sometimes after pressure from their party: in 2008 Dail Jones (New Zealand First) and Russel Norman (Green); and in 2011 Louisa Wall (Labour) after five above her on the list declined.

Historically, however, they have taken place considerably more frequently – the 2nd Parliament of 1856–1860, for example, saw 33 by-elections and four supplementary elections, despite the House of Representatives originally having just 37 seats (increasing to 41 seats during the parliamentary term).

In the past it was not uncommon for an MP who died in office to be replaced with an immediate family member such as a brother, wife (see widow&#x27;s succession), or son. This resulted in the election of the first woman MP Elizabeth McCombs (who was in turn succeeded by her son Terry McCombs), the first woman National MP Mary Grigg, and the first woman Māori MP Iriaka Rātana; all of whom took over their husband&#x27;s seat. This practice has however fallen out of favour since the mid-seventies with the election of John Kirk to his late father&#x27;s seat being the last occasion this happened at a by-election.

Mary Grigg was elected unopposed, and Wood notes that the 1942 Mid-Canterbury by-election is an extreme case where the election was gazetted without date of election, and four different dates are available from reputable sources: &quot;Official Year-book, Parliamentary Record, Journals of the House&quot; and J Boston.

Twelve Prime Ministers first came to parliament via by-elections: Julius Vogel, Harry Atkinson, Robert Stout, John Ballance, William Hall-Jones, William Massey, Peter Fraser, Keith Holyoake, Walter Nash, Bill Rowling, David Lange and Geoffrey Palmer. Six Prime Ministers (William Fox, Henry Sewell, Edward Stafford, George Grey, Joseph Ward and Jacinda Ardern) have won by-elections later in their parliamentary careers, while Labour leaders Harry Holland and David Shearer were also first elected via a by-election.

Some minor party founders have also launched their parties by resigning from a major party and their seat, then contesting it for their new party. Party founders who have done this include Matiu Rata and Tariana Turia. Both resigned from Labour to form Māori parties. In 1980 Rata was unsuccessful in retaking his Northern Maori electorate for his newly formed Mana Motuhake party, but in 2004 Turia successfully reclaimed Te Tai Hauauru for the Māori Party. In addition, Winston Peters resigned from National and his parliamentary seat in 1993, retaking the seat as an independent and going on to form the New Zealand First party. In these circumstances, by-elections are seen as a legitimisation of the MP&#x27;s rejection of his or her old party. In addition, they provide vital publicity and something of a mandate for the new party.

By-elections for the party in government in the two-party era due to a resignation were sometimes an opportunity for party supporters to abstain or to vote against the government if they disapprove of their party&#x27;s policies, without endangering the government. Bruce Beetham entered parliament for Social Credit at the 1978 Rangitikei by-election, as did Gary Knapp in the 1980 East Coast Bays by-election. In the 1994 Selwyn by-election National retained the seat, but the Alliance candidate came second, perhaps held by votes from disaffected Labour voters for the Alliance candidate. The 1926 Eden by-election was won by Labour who became the official opposition, helped by a split over the Reform candidate selection.

<text>Wythall is a large village and civil parish in the Bromsgrove District, in the northeastern corner of the county of Worcestershire, England. Wythall parish borders Solihull and Birmingham, and had a population of 12,269 in the UK census of 2021.

The civil parish was created in 1911 when the remainder of the previous King&#x27;s Norton civil parish was absorbed into the then County Borough of Birmingham. 

Wythall village is around 7 miles south of Birmingham City Centre (a 20-minute train journey from Wythall railway station) along Alcester Road. There are a number of 19th century buildings on this road including the Wythall Institute (erected 1888/89). The civil parish of Wythall has always included Drake&#x27;s Cross, Hollywood and Headley Heath and today also includes Major&#x27;s Green and the formerly undeveloped Worcestershire part of Walker&#x27;s Heath. Wythall village itself is generally the area covered by the parish ward of Grimes Hill and the northeastern portion of the Wythall Heath parish ward, combined population 2,080, although the Silver Street and Chapel Lane areas are also usually included (the remainder of the Wythall Heath parish ward additionally includes the subsidiary settlements of Inkford and Tanner&#x27;s Green along with the Kings Norton Golf Course). The easternmost section of Wythall village, around the railway station, was traditionally referred to as Grimes Hill.
The former St Mary&#x27;s Anglican church has a roof and stair turret added by W.H. Bidlake.

There are two primary schools within Wythall parish, the Coppice Primary School in Hollywood and Meadow Green Primary School in Wythall village. There was previously a school in Silver Street from circa 1875 to 1992 which for many years catered for all primary aged school children in Wythall and the surrounding area, until a growing population required more school development. Woodrush High School in Hollywood opened in 1958 for children aged 11 and over, and Shawhurst Infants School (next door to Woodrush) opened around 1967, leaving what was by now called Silvermead School as a junior school. Meadow Green School opened in the early 1960s to give additional junior and infant provision. During 1991-92 an extension was built on Shawhurst Infants School, and its development became the Coppice Primary School. The Silvermead site was then closed, although many of its buildings have been converted into homes as Silvermead Court. The Coppice Primary School became an Academy in December 2011 and since 2012 is the largest primary school in the area with a three form entry.

The local secondary school, Woodrush High School, has an Astroturf and playing fields backing on to the Coppice Primary School.

Until 2002 a private school, Innisfree House, existed in Station Road. Its original purpose was the education of the children of officers of the RAF station (see below), and in the years post-World War II was attended by the young Bruce Chatwin whose parents were living on a smallholding at Umberslade some 3 miles away.

From 1939 to 1959 Wythall was home to a Royal Air Force station, initially housing a barrage balloon facility, and latterly, 1952–57, a Joint Services School of Applied Linguistics, training men from the RN and RAF in Russian military terminology and the use of radios for Signals Intelligence purposes; additionally, Chinese, Czech, German and Polish were taught to small numbers of RAF men. Part of the site is now occupied by the Transport Museum, Chapel Lane, which has a collection of historic buses and battery electric vehicles.

A sawmill, currently named Davies Timber Ltd., has been in operation for over 100 years and was steam powered at some point in its history, with maps from 1838 also showing a brickyard opposite the site.

Hourly West Midlands Railway services are run between Stratford-Upon-Avon and Kidderminster, through Wythall Station and Earlswood, and hourly to and from Worcester Foregate Street terminating at Whitlocks End Station, one stop short of Wythall. The village is linked to Redditch and Kings Heath by Diamond Bus service 150 and hourly Landflight service A4 to Solihull, both operating Mon-Sat.

<doc id="667280" wikidata="Q245194" url="?curid=667280" title="The Twelve Chairs">
<text>The Twelve Chairs () is a Russian classic satirical picaresque novel by the Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov, published in 1928. Its plot follows characters attempting to obtain jewelry hidden in a chair. A sequel was published in 1931. The novel has been adapted to other media, primarily film.

==Plot==

In the Soviet Union in 1927, during the NEP era, a former Marshal of the Nobility, Ippolit Matveyevich &quot;Kisa&quot; Vorobyaninov, works as the registrar of marriages and deaths in a sleepy provincial town. His mother-in-law reveals on her deathbed that her family jewellery was hidden from the Bolsheviks in one of the twelve chairs from the family&#x27;s dining-room set. Those chairs, along with all other personal property, were taken away by the Communists after the 1917 Russian Revolution. Vorobyaninov wants to find the treasure. The “smooth operator” and con-man Ostap Bender forces Kisa to become his partner, and they set out to find the chairs. Bender&#x27;s street-smarts and charm are invaluable to the reticent Kisa, and Bender comes to dominate the enterprise.

The &quot;conсessioners&quot; trace the chairs, which are to be sold at auction in Moscow. They fail to buy them and learn that the chairs have been split up for resale individually. Roaming all over the Soviet Union in their quest to recover the furniture, they have a series of comic adventures, including living in a students&#x27; dormitory with plywood walls, posing as bill-painters on a riverboat to earn passage, bamboozling a village chess-club with promises of an international tournament, and traveling on foot through the mountains of Georgia. Father Fyodor (who had known of the treasure from the confession of Vorobyaninov&#x27;s mother-in-law), their obsessed rival in the hunt for the treasure, follows a bad lead, runs out of money, ends up trapped on a mountain-top, and loses his sanity. Ostap remains unflappable, and his mastery of human nature eliminates all obstacles, but Vorobyaninov&#x27;s mental state steadily deteriorates.

They slowly acquire each of the chairs in turn, but no treasure is found. Kisa and Ostap finally discover the location of the last chair. Finally fed up with his deceitful partner&#x27;s greedy arrogance and condescending meanness, Vorobyaninov murders Ostap in his sleep so as to keep all the loot for himself, but then discovers that the jewels have already been found and were used to fund the building of the new public recreation center in which the chair was found, a symbol of the new society. Angered, Vorobyaninov loses his own sanity.

==Legacy==
===Sequel===

Ostap Bender reappears in the book&#x27;s sequel &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot;, despite his apparent death in &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel has inspired at least twenty adaptations in the Soviet Union and abroad:

* The first cinematic adaptation of the novel is the joint Polish-Czech film &quot;Dvanáct křesel&quot; (1933). The original plot was considerably altered, yet many following adaptations were primarily based on this film rather than on the novel itself (e.g., the former marshal of nobility from the novel was replaced in the Polish-Czech film by a barber who then appeared in several later adaptations).
* In England, the book inspired the film &quot;Keep Your Seats, Please&quot; (1936), directed by Monty Banks at Ealing Studios and starring George Formby. The action takes place in Britain and involves seven chairs, not twelve.
* In Nazi Germany, the film &quot;Thirteen Chairs&quot; (1938) is based on the novel. However, the film does not credit the novel&#x27;s authors.
* Dmitri Shostakovich&#x27;s unfinished operetta &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1939) is based on the novel.
* In Hollywood, the comedy &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag!&quot; (1945) starring Fred Allen is very loosely based on the novel, using just five chairs.
* A Brazilian version called &quot;Thirteen Chairs&quot; (1957) stars comedians Oscarito, Renata Fronzi, and Zé Trindade. In this version, the main character, played by Oscarito, inherits his aunt&#x27;s mansion, which is soon confiscated, leaving him with only 13 chairs. After selling them, he finds out that his aunt had hidden her fortune in the chairs. He then goes on a quest to get the chairs back.
* Tomás Gutiérrez Alea made a Cuban version titled &quot;Las Doce Sillas&quot; (1962) with Reynaldo Miravalles as Ostap. Set in a tropical context, in this version the hero &quot;sees the light&quot;, becomes corrected and joins Cuban revolutionary youth in &quot;zafra&quot; campaign (sugar cane harvesting).
* The story also served as the basis for the 1969 film &quot;The Thirteen Chairs&quot; starring Sharon Tate.
* A Syrian TV series entitled &quot;Hamam al-Hana&quot; (1968) is based on the premise of this novel. It involves three guys looking for the hidden treasure (a stash of money) all over Damascus, with a chair for every episode. In the last episode, they find the right chair, but the treasure turns out to be old paper money which by then had become useless. 
* Mel Brooks made a version titled &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1970), following the novel more closely, but with a happier ending. Frank Langella plays the part of Ostap Bender with Ron Moody as Vorobyaninov and Dom DeLuise as Father Fyodor.
* In the 1970s, two adaptations were made in the USSR: a film in 1971 by Leonid Gaidai with Archil Gomiashvili as Bender and a miniseries in 1976 by Mark Zakharov with Andrei Mironov as Bender.

<text>The Little Golden Calf (, &quot;Zolotoy telyonok&quot;) is a satirical picaresque novel by Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov, published in 1931. Its main character, Ostap Bender, also appears in a previous novel by the authors called &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot;. The title alludes to the &quot;golden calf&quot; of the Bible.

==Plot summary==
Ostap Bender is still alive (but sports a scar across his neck), after barely surviving the assassination attempt in the previous book, which he once briefly mentions as &quot;stupid business&quot;. This time he hears a story about a &quot;clandestine millionaire&quot; named Alexandr Koreiko. Koreiko has made millions through various illegal enterprises by taking advantage of the widespread corruption in the New Economic Policy (NEP) period while pretending to live on an office clerk&#x27;s salary of 46 rubles a month. Koreiko lives in &quot;Chernomorsk&quot; (literally: Black Sea city, referring to the city of Odesa) and keeps his large stash of ill-gotten money in a suitcase, waiting for the fall of the Soviet government, so that he can make use of it.

Expecting a long time of search for Koreiko, Bender decides to legalize himself and sets up a fictional enterprise &quot;Horns and Hoofs&quot;, allegedly in charge of procurement of raw material for hair comb and button industry, headed by &quot;&quot;, a professional &quot;prison-sitter&quot; (German &quot;sitzen&quot; means to &quot;sit&quot;), whose sole responsibility was to &quot;sit&quot; in a prison in the case of legal troubles, with salary doubled. Literary critic writes that there indeed was such an occupation at the break of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Together with two petty criminals Balaganov and Panikovsky, and an extremely naive and innocent car driver Kozlevich, Bender finds out about Koreiko and starts to collect all the information he can get on his business activities. Koreiko tries to flee, but Bender eventually tracks him down in Turkestan, on the newly built Turkestan–Siberia Railway. He then blackmails him into giving him a million rubles.

Suddenly rich, Bender faces the problem of how to spend his money in a Communist country where there are no legal millionaires. Nothing of the life of the rich that Bender dreamt of seems possible in the Soviet Union. Frustrated, Bender even decides to anonymously donate the money to the Ministry of Finance, but changes his mind. He turns the money into jewels and gold, and tries to cross the Romanian border, only to be robbed by the Romanian border guards, leaving him only with a medal, the Order of the Golden Fleece.

== Main characters ==

*Ostap Ibragimovich Bender, the main character and protagonist
*Shura Balaganov, the second &quot;Son of Lieutenant Schmidt&quot;
*Mikhail Samuelevich Panikovsky, the third &quot;Son of Lieutenant Schmidt&quot;
*Adam Kazimirovich Kozlevich, a &quot;Wildebeest&quot; taxi () driver
*Alexandr Ivanovich Koreiko, a clandestine millionaire who works as a simple accountant

== Two endings ==

There are two alternative endings to &quot;The Golden Calf&quot;. One was written at the time the novel was originally submitted for publication to the &quot;Thirty Days&quot; magazine. The other appeared later, probably due to the objections to the writers for lionizing their main character. According to the first, Ostap Bender, after obtaining his &quot;million&quot;, gets to know the sorrow of a lonely man who has fulfilled his purpose, renounces the fortune, and marries his beloved, Zoya Sinitskaya. In the second, he is torn. At first, he returns his &quot;million&quot; to the Commissariat of Finance, but then changes his mind. Determined to travel to Rio de Janeiro, he is caught crossing the Romanian border and sent back home, after being robbed of his fortune by Romanian border guards.

==Cultural influence==
The book contributed a number of catchphrases and colorful terms into the Russian language, such as &quot;&quot;Horns and Hoofs&quot; company (&quot;Рога и копыта&quot;)&quot; for dummy corporation, &quot;sitz-chairman&quot; for a chairman with no real rights, and &quot;Children of Lieutenant Schmidt&quot; for con men, see the page for the book for more.

===Adaptations===
Mikhail Schweitzer made a black-and-white film &quot;The Golden Calf&quot; (1968) with Sergey Yursky as Bender. It was adapted as &quot;Mechty Idiota&quot; (Idiot&#x27;s Dreams, 1993) by director Vasili Pichul, starring pop singer Sergei Krylov as Bender. 
The Russian Channel One aired an eight-part TV series &quot;&quot; (2006) starring Oleg Menshikov as Bender. Miklós Szinetár directed a 3.30 hours Hungarian adaptation TV-series Aranyborjú (1974) starring Iván Darvas as Ostap Bender.
The 2009 translation into English, &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; by Annie O. Fisher (published by Russian Life Books) was the first unabridged, uncensored translation into English of the novel. The translation won the 2010 AATSEEL Award for Best Translation into English from any Slavic language.

<text>Allan Francis Smethurst (19 November 1927 – 22 December 2000), aka The Singing Postman was an English folk singer and postman. He is best known for his self-penned novelty song &quot;Hev Yew Gotta Loight, Boy?&quot;, which earned him an Ivor Novello Award in 1966, “Come Along A Me” and &quot;A Miss from Diss&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; dubbed him a &quot;bookishly melancholy folk-satirist&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Walshaw, near Bury, Lancashire, the son of Allan and Gladys Mabel (&quot;née&quot; Curson), Smethurst was raised in Sheringham, Norfolk, from the age of 11. His mother came from the village of Stiffkey, 15 miles to the west. It is often thought that he became a postman in Lavenham, Suffolk, but photos of him in the area are just promotional material. Smethurst joined the Post Office in 1953, and later worked in Grimsby. He never worked for the GPO in Norfolk or Suffolk.

Smethurst hummed tunes on his daily post round for 12 years, writing and singing songs in his characteristic Norfolk dialect. An audition tape sent to the BBC earned him a spot on Ralph Tuck&#x27;s BBC East regional radio programme &quot;Wednesday Morning&quot;. His popularity led to Tuck recording Smethurst on his own record label, ‘The Smallest Recording Organisation in the World’, based in Lowestoft. A four-track EP containing his signature tune “Hev Yew Gotta Loight Boy”, made the EP charts in 1965. This was followed by another EP release by Ralph Tuck, and an album &quot;The Singing Postman&#x27;s Year&quot;. He was then signed to EMI who re-released earlier songs and recorded new items. A colour promotional film was made of “Hev Yew Gotta Loight Boy” which has survived to this day. He made numerous live and promotional performances, including on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, but was afflicted by nerves and stage fright. His live performances included a summer season in 1965 at the Windmill Theatre in Great Yarmouth.

In 1966, the Singing Postman&#x27;s best known hit &quot;Hev Yew Gotta Loight, Boy?&quot; won Smethurst the Ivor Novello Award for best novelty song of the year. Rolf Harris recorded a cover version without success. The song had a small comeback in 1994, when it was featured on a television commercial for Ovaltine. It was also covered by punk band Splodgenessabounds in 1981.

Smethurst left the music industry in 1970 citing stage fright and arthritic hands. He later admitted to an alcohol problem and revealed all his earnings were gone and he was penniless. He spent his last 20 years living quietly in a Salvation Army hostel in Grimsby, where he died from a heart attack in December 2000.

In September 2010, a BBC Radio 4 programme, &quot;In Search of the Singing Postman&quot; was broadcast; it was written and presented by D. J. Taylor.

<text>The Fox Islands () are a group of islands in the eastern Aleutian Islands of the U.S. state of Alaska. The Fox Islands are the closest to mainland North America in the Aleutian chain, and just east of Samalga Pass and the Islands of Four Mountains group.

Inhabited by the Aleut for centuries, the islands, along with the rest of the Aleutians, were first visited by Europeans in 1741, when the Imperial Russian Navy and the Danish-born Russian navigator Vitus Bering was searching for new sources of fur for Russian fur trappers.

Foggy almost all year round, the islands are difficult to navigate due to constantly adverse weather and numerous reefs. The Fox Islands Passes are the waterways surrounding the islands. As with the other Aleutian islands, the Fox Islands are prone to frequent earthquakes year-round.

The larger Fox Islands are, from west to east, Umnak, Unalaska, Amaknak, Akutan, Akun, Unimak and Sanak. Islands lying west of Akutan are in the Aleutians West Census Area. From Akutan eastward they are in the Aleutians East Borough.

&quot;Fox Islands&quot; is the English translation of the name given to the islands in the 18th century by Russian explorers and fur traders.

==Popular culture==

The islands are depicted as the &quot;Fox Archipelago&quot; in the Metal Gear video game franchise, serving as the location of the fictional Shadow Moses Island, which is the main setting of its 1998 installment &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and one of the settings of the 2008 follow-up &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;.

<doc id="667292" wikidata="Q2725705" url="?curid=667292" title="Warwickshire County Cricket Club">
<text>Warwickshire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Warwickshire. 

Founded in 1882, the club held minor status until it was elevated to first-class in 1894 pending its entry into the County Championship in 1895.Since then, Warwickshire have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. 

Warwickshire currently competes in four main competitions. In the County Championship, they compete in Division One (the top division), and last won it outright in 2021 (for a total of eight championship wins). The 50 over Royal London One Day Cup they compete as &#x27;Warwickshire&#x27;, but for other short-format cricket, they are named differently. For the T20 Blast they are the Birmingham Bears, and they compete in The Hundred as Birmingham Phoenix.

Warwickshire&#x27;s kit colours are all white with a dash of navy blue for the county championship, and for short-format cricket, they use navy blue and gold. Shirt sponsors include Scrivens Opticians (County Championship), Talbots Law (T20 Blast), and Butterkist (The 100). The club&#x27;s home is Edgbaston Cricket Ground in central Birmingham, which also regularly hosts Test and One-Day International matches.

==Earliest cricket==
Cricket may have reached Warwickshire by the end of the 17th century. The &quot;Warwickshire &amp; Staffordshire Journal&quot; was certainly aware of the sport in 1738 for it carried a report of a London v Mitcham game at the Artillery Ground on 11 August (London won by 1 wicket).

The earliest confirmed reference to cricket in the county is a match announcement in &quot;Aris’ Gazette&quot; on 15 July 1751.

There was a prominent club in Coventry towards the end of the 18th century which played two well-documented matches against Leicester in 1787 and 1788. Reports of both games are included in &quot;Fresh Light on 18th Century Cricket&quot; by G. B. Buckley. Leicester won both games by 45 and 28 runs respectively.

==Club history==
Warwickshire CCC was officially founded on 8 April 1882 at a meeting in The Regent Hotel, Leamington Spa.
The club developed so well that by the time of the first official County Championship in 1890 it was playing some of the top first-class counties such as Surrey and Yorkshire. Warwickshire became first-class themselves in 1894 and surprised the cricket world with wins over Surrey at The Oval and Nottinghamshire. They competed in the County Championship from 1895 but despite being strong in batting, their bowling was, until the arrival of Sam Hargreave and Frank Field in 1899, very weak. From 1900 to 1906 they were strong enough to be in the upper-middle reaches of the table, but the decline of their bowling from 1907 returned them to the lower reaches of the table late in that decade.

Frank Foster, who first played as an amateur left-arm pace bowler in 1908 but improved greatly in 1910 as a result of slowing his pace to gain accuracy, still stands as Warwickshire&#x27;s greatest all-rounder. In 1911 he headed both batting and bowling averages and, along with a fully fit Frank Field, enabled Warwickshire to take the Championship from the &quot;Big Six&quot; for the only time between 1890 and 1935. Foster and Field took between then 238 wickets, but in &quot;Wisden&quot; nobody doubted that Warwickshire&#x27;s win was largely caused by an abnormally dry summer, and the following three years saw them return to mid-table although Foster in 1914 displayed all-round form equal to that of 1911.

In 1919, with Foster having had an accident that ended his short career, Warwickshire fell to last in the table. They did not improve a great deal until the 1930s when Bob Wyatt&#x27;s captaincy and the bowling of Mayer, Paine and Hollies moved them to fourth in 1934, but as Paine rapidly declined, they fell away. When Wyatt left for Worcestershire after World War II, they declined even further despite Hollies&#x27; wonderful bowling in 1946 – with no support at all, he took 175 wickets for only 15 each. The acquisition of New Zealand speedster Tom Pritchard gave Hollies the necessary support and by 1948 they had one of the strongest attacks in county cricket. It was this bowling power, along with effective, if not wonderful batting, that gave them the Championship in 1951. However, as with 1911, they fell off rapidly as their batting became unreliable over the rest of the decade. After Hollies&#x27; retirement in 1957, there were some very poor seasons (though they came fourth in 1959 due to Mike Smith&#x27;s superb batting) until Tom Cartwright emerged as a top-class seam bowler in 1962. The county came second in 1964 but did not establish itself at the top until the late 1960s. In 1971 Lance Gibbs&#x27; magnificent bowling enabled them to come second, whilst brilliant batting gave them a clear Championship win in 1972.

Yet again, though, a Championship win was followed by a decline and the next twenty years saw the county almost always in the lower half of the table. In 1981 and 1982, with Bob Willis doing nothing for them whilst producing match-winning form for England, they averaged over 45 runs for each wicket they took – still a record. Only under the coaching of Bob Woolmer and captaincy of Dermot Reeve (with their allowed foreign player being one of Brian Lara, Shaun Pollock or Allan Donald) did the team become &quot;consistently&quot; successful. Although they had won the NatWest Trophy in 1989, it was their astonishing victory in the same competition in 1993, overhauling a record score posted by Sussex in the final, which launched their most dominant period in English cricket. In 1994 they secured a historic treble, winning the County Championship, Axa Equity &amp; Law League (later the National Cricket League and Pro40) and Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. In that season Lara set the world record for a first-class cricket score of 501 whilst playing for Warwickshire against Durham County Cricket Club; the team total of 810–4 declared in that match is also a club record. In 1995 they won the County Championship again, and also won the C&amp;G Trophy. This was to be the last trophy of Dermot Reeve&#x27;s captaincy with him stepping down during the 1996 season, Bob Woolmer also having moved on to coach South Africa. 1997 saw them lifting the AXA league trophy once again, but this proved to be a false dawn. Performances for the next few years were poor, including relegation to the second division of the County Championship and National Cricket leagues.

However they have since been promoted in both competitions (though relegated again in the National Cricket League), won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 2002 and strong performances with the bat saw the county reclaim the County Championship in 2004. Warwickshire were once again promoted in the national cricket league and played in the top division of both competitions in 2006.

Until the year 2005, the club captain was Nick Knight, the coach was John Inverarity, and the Chief Executive was Dennis Amiss, though all three stepped down at the end of the season. Heath Streak was appointed as captain for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, but resigned after one game of the 2007 season on 25 April 2007, and Darren Maddy replaced Streak as captain.

The 2007 Championship season was a big disaster for Warwickshire, who were relegated to Division Two, after not winning a single game since they topped the table in early May. They also got relegated from Pro40 league, a matter made worse when local rivals Worcestershire CCC clinched the title.

Since the end of the disastrous 2007 season, Warwickshire made several changes to the team and management staff. Controversial coach Mark Greatbatch was sacked and Ashley Giles replaced him as Director of Cricket. Former Warwickshire Bear and South Africa international Allan Donald joined the Bears&#x27; coaching staff. Fans favourite Dougie Brown also took up an Academy Coaching role. After a successful campaign in Division 2, the Bears were promoted back to the top flight after only a season&#x27;s absence in September 2008.

Maddy stepped down from the captaincy in November 2008. Ian Westwood was announced as his replacement. In 2009 Indian seamer Sreesanth replaced Jeetan Patel, who was busy with national duties for New Zealand, to become the first Indian to join the club. Westwood, in turn, stepped down as captain at the end of the 2010 season. Jim Troughton took over as captain shortly after, before struggling with injury during the 2014 season. Varun Chopra stood in before Troughton retired from first-class cricket in 2015, promoting Chopra to permanent captain.

Early in 2016, Varun Chopra resigned the captaincy in order to focus on batting, with Ian Bell taking over as captain.

At the end of the 2016 season despite winning the Royal London Cup earlier in the season, Director of Cricket Dougie Brown was replaced by Jim Troughton as Head Coach with former Director of Cricket Ashley Giles returning to Edgbaston to take responsibility for all cricket associated with Warwickshire. Bell resigned as captain on 20 August 2017.

===Twenty20 Cup history===

2003

Warwickshire&#x27;s first-ever game in Twenty20 cricket was against Somerset at Taunton, where the Bears defeated the Sabres by 19 runs. This result was followed by wins over Worcestershire (by 20 runs), Glamorgan (by 68 runs), and Northamptonshire (by 54 runs). Gloucestershire, who finished first in the division, were the only team to beat the Bears when they won by 8 wickets at Edgbaston. This meant that Warwickshire finished second in the Midlands, West and Wales Division behind Gloucestershire, and qualified for the finals day as the best runner-up.

The finals day was held on 19 July at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. Warwickshire met Leicestershire in their semi-final, who they defeated by 7 wickets, with Trevor Penney top-scoring for the Bears with 43 runs. Surrey claimed victory over Gloucestershire in their semi-final to set up a Surrey-Warwickshire final. Unfortunately, Warwickshire were unable to perform in the final and only scored 115 runs. Surrey managed to score 119 runs in just 11 overs and claimed victory.

2004

With expectations high at Edgbaston, Warwickshire entertained Somerset in the first clash of the 2004 season. The Bears secured victory by 7 wickets. After Warwickshire lost to Glamorgan (by 26 runs), things started to look bad for the Bears. Defeats against Worcestershire (by 3 wickets), and Northamptonshire (by 4 wickets), left the team in danger of not qualifying for the Quarter-Finals, but victory over Gloucestershire (by 2 wickets) on the last day, meant that Warwickshire qualified as one of the best third-placed team.

The Bears drew Glamorgan in the quarter-finals. Although they had managed to beat Glamorgan at Cardiff once, Warwickshire were not able to achieve victory again, and lost by 5 wickets to the Dragons, who progressed to the finals day, and eventually went out to the 2004 victors, the Leicestershire Foxes.

2005

With changes to the format for the 2005 season, Warwickshire now had to play 8 games in the group stage to qualify. Their first game of the season was against Worcestershire at New Road, where the Bears lost by only 1 run. This was followed by defeats to Northamptonshire (by 38 runs), and another 1-run defeat to Worcestershire. Warwickshire secured qualification from the MMW division in second after victories over Glamorgan (by 20 runs and by 4 runs) Somerset (by 47 runs) Northamptonshire (by 41 runs), and a no-result against Gloucestershire.

Warwickshire bowed out of the competition in the quarter-final to Surrey. After sharing a nail-biting draw (Surrey 149 (20 Overs), Warwickshire 115 (15 Overs)), a bowl off followed, with Surrey claiming victory 4–3. Surrey would go on to be defeated in the Semi-Final to Lancashire, who themselves lost in the final to Somerset.

2006

Warwickshire started the 2006 season by playing Northamptonshire at the County Ground, Northampton where the Bears won by 24 runs. This was followed by wins over Somerset (by 7 wickets), Northampton (by 20 runs), Worcestershire (by 11 runs); defeats to Glamorgan (by 6 wickets), Gloucestershire (by 3 runs), Worcestershire (by 4 runs), and a no-result against Glamorgan. Warwickshire secured third position in the table, but their record was worse than both Yorkshire and Kent (who both finished third in their respected leagues), so did not qualify for the quarter-final.

The final&#x27;s day was once again controlled by Leicestershire, who beat Nottinghamshire in a spectacular final that lasted to the last over of the game.

2007

Warwickshire recruited the services of twice winner, and Twenty20 expert Darren Maddy for the 2007 season, and his expertise helped the team to once again reach the quarter-finals of the competition. The Bears started with a victory over Somerset by 7 runs. This was followed by wins against Glamorgan (by 3 runs and by 9 runs) Northamptonshire (by 12 runs), Gloucestershire (by 27 runs), defeats against Northamptonshire (by 4 wickets), Worcestershire (by 13 runs), and no results against Worcestershire. The Bears qualified as the MMW leaders, with 11 points from 8 games.

In the quarter-final, Warwickshire hosted Lancashire in an entertaining game. After Lancashire set the Bears 194 to win, Warwickshire were able to claw back to 187 for 7, and lost by 7 runs. It was Lancashire who would go through to face Gloucestershire, Sussex, and Kent on the Finals day, held at Edgbaston in August.

2012

Warwickshire finished fourth of six teams in the Midlands/Wales/West division, failing to make the quarter-finals.

2013

Warwickshire finished fourth of six teams in the Midlands/Wales/West division, failing to make the quarter-finals.
After the season, Warwickshire changed their name to Birmingham Bears for T20 competitions. The Bears has been synonymous with the team for many years and will continue to play under the Warwickshire banner in the other two competitions.

2014

The Birmingham Bears came fourth in the North Group (behind Lancashire Lightning, Nottinghamshire Outlaws and Worcestershire Rapids) to qualify for the knockout stages. They faced Essex in the quarter-finals which they won by 19 Runs, to reach finals day at their home ground. On Finals Day, having beaten Surrey in the semi-final, they went on to beat Lancashire by 4 runs to win their first T20 title.

==Birmingham Bears==
Birmingham Bears are a T20 cricket team located in Birmingham, founded as Warwickshire Bears in 2003 and rebranded as Birmingham Bears in 2014. They are a part of Warwickshire County Cricket Club and play at Edgbaston Cricket Ground in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham. They have won one Natwest T20 Blast, the 2014 t20 Blast, beating Lancashire Lightning in the final at Edgbaston. Their playing squad and coaching staff are the same as the Warwickshire first-class and List A team, although an additional overseas player is granted for the T20 Blast.

Under the guidance of Dougie Brown and captained by Jim Troughton Birmingham won 7 of their 14 group games, finishing fourth in the North Group and qualifying for the quarter-finals. In the quarter-finals they defeated Essex by 19 runs, qualifying for Finals Day. In their Finals Day semi-final, they defeated Surrey by 16 runs, setting up a final with Lancashire. In the Final they defeated Lancashire by 4 runs, securing them their first Twenty20 title. The overseas players were Shoaib Malik and Jeetan Patel, who finished the season as leading wicket-taker with 25 wickets.

This season captained by Varun Chopra Birmingham won 10 of their 14 group games, finishing top of the North Group and qualifying for the quarter-finals. Once again they met Essex in the quarter-finals, defeating them again by 24 runs. At Finals Day however they lost their semi-final to Northamptonshire who would go on to win the title. Jeetan Patel returned as an overseas player, but was this year joined by fellow New Zealander Brendon McCullum. The Bears also set the highest team score of the competition, scoring 242/2 against Derbyshire in the group stages, with McCullum scoring 158 not out in this game.

Once again under a new captain in Ian Bell Birmingham performed poorly, finishing sixth in the North Group winning just 6 of their 14 games. Jeetan Patel returned as overseas player for a third season, this year joined by wicketkeepers Luke Ronchi and Matthew Wade who both played half the tournament each.

Under new leadership for the fourth season, this time by former New Zealand international Grant Elliott and new coaching in former player Jim Troughton the Bears improved on their previous season, winning 8 of their 14 group games, finishing third in the North Group qualifying them for the quarter-finals. In the quarter-final they met Surrey defeating them by 6 wickets in a high-scoring game, qualifying them for Finals Day. In the semi-final they met Glamorgan, winning by 11 runs qualifying them for the Final. However, they lost the final to Nottinghamshire by 22 runs. Patel returned as overseas player for a fourth season, this year joined by Colin de Grandhomme, with captain Elliott qualifying as a Kolpak player due to being born in South Africa.

Under the same captain and same coaching, with the same overseas players, the Bears missed out on the quarter-finals for just the second time in their history, winning just 6 of their 14 group games. Former England international Ian Bell though finished as third top run-scorer, finishing the season with 580 runs from his 14 games.

<text>The Studebaker Avanti is a personal luxury coupe manufactured and marketed by Studebaker Corporation between June 1962 and December 1963. A halo car for the maker, it was marketed as &quot;America&#x27;s only four-passenger high-performance personal car.&quot;

Described as &quot;one of the more significant milestones of the postwar industry&quot;, the Raymond Loewy-designed car offered safety features and high-speed performance. Called &quot;the fastest production car in the world&quot; upon its introduction, a modified Avanti reached over with its supercharged R3 engine at the Bonneville Salt Flats. In all, it broke 29 world speed records at the Bonneville Salt Flats.

Following Studebaker&#x27;s discontinuation of the model, a succession of five ventures manufactured and marketed derivatives of the Avanti model through 2006. These ventures licensed intellectual property and, in some cases procured parts, through arrangements with the successors to the Studebaker assets.

==Name==
Studebaker&#x27;s advertising agency provided the name Avanti. In Italian it means &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;onward&quot;.

==Design==
The Avanti was developed at the direction of Studebaker president, Sherwood Egbert, who took over in February 1961. The car&#x27;s design theme was &quot;allegedly doodled by Egbert on the proverbial back of an envelope during an airplane flight.&quot; Egbert&#x27;s &#x27;doodle&#x27; was to answer Ford&#x27;s Thunderbird and an attempt to improve the automaker&#x27;s sagging performance. Designed by Raymond Loewy&#x27;s team of Tom Kellogg, Bob Andrews, and John Ebstein on a 40-day crash program, the Avanti featured a radical fiberglass body mounted on a modified Studebaker Lark 109-inch convertible chassis and powered by a modified 289 Hawk engine. A Paxton supercharger was offered as an option.

In eight days the stylists finished a &quot;clay scale model with two different sides: one a two-place sports car, the other a four-seat GT coupe.&quot; Tom Kellogg, a young California stylist hired for this project by Loewy, &quot;felt it should be a four-seat coupe.&quot; &quot;Loewy envisioned a low-slung, long-hood-short-deck semi-fastback coupe with a grilleless nose and a wasp-waisted curvature to the rear fenders, suggesting a supersonic aircraft.&quot;

The Avanti&#x27;s complex body shape &quot;would have been both challenging and prohibitively expensive to build in steel&quot; with Studebaker electing to mold the exterior panels in glass-reinforced plastic (fiberglass), outsourcing the work to Molded Fiberglass Body in Ashtabula, Ohio — the same company that built the fiberglass panels for the Chevrolet Corvette in 1953.

The Avanti featured front disc-brakes that were British Dunlop designed units, made under license by Bendix, &quot;the first American production model to offer them.&quot; It was one of the first bottom breather designs where air enters from under the front of the vehicle rather than via a conventional grille above the front bumper, a design feature much more common after the 1980s.

== Launch ==

The Avanti was publicly introduced on April 26, 1962, &quot;simultaneously at the New York International Automobile Show and at the Annual Shareholders&#x27; Meeting.&quot; Rodger Ward, winner of the 1962 Indianapolis 500, received a Studebaker Avanti as part of his prize package, &quot;thus becoming the first private owner of an Avanti.&quot; A Studebaker Lark convertible was the Indianapolis pace car that year and the Avanti was named the honorary pace car.

In December 1962 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported: &quot;Launching of operations at Studebaker&#x27;s own fiber-glass body works to increase the production of Avantis.&quot; Many production problems concerning the supplier, fit, and finish resulted in delays and cancelled orders.

Egbert planned to sell 20,000 Avantis in 1962, but could build only 1,200.

==End of production==
After the closure of Studebaker&#x27;s factory on December 20, 1963, &quot;Competition Press&quot; reported: &quot;Avantis will no longer be manufactured and contrary to the report that there are thousands gathering dust in South Bend warehouses, Studebaker has only five Avantis left. Dealers have about 2,500, and 1,600 have been sold since its introduction.&quot; This contrasted with Chevrolet which produced 23,631 Corvette sports cars in 1963. According to the book &quot;My Father The Car&quot; written about Stu Chapman, Studebaker Corporation&#x27;s Advertising &amp; Public Relations Department head in Canada, Studebaker seriously considered reintroducing the Avanti into Studebaker showrooms in 1965/66 after production resumed in 1965 via Studebaker-Packard dealership owners Newman &amp; Altman.

==Succession==
The Avanti name, tooling, and plant space were sold to two South Bend, Indiana, Studebaker dealers, Nate Altman and Leo Newman. They reintroduced a slightly modified hand-built version of the original Avanti using leftover Studebaker chassis and engines from General Motors. There was no connection with the Studebaker brand name.

==Revival==
Following Altman and Newman&#x27;s effort, a succession of additional entrepreneurs purchased the tooling and name to manufacture small numbers of increasingly modified variants of the car, including the Avanti II, through 2006.

==Avanti Owners Association==
The Avanti Owners Association International is an active association with nearly 2,000 members worldwide and meeting yearly in various cities in the United States and in Switzerland. Members of the not-for-profit organization receive the full-color quarterly &quot;Avanti Magazine&quot; publication, published since the organization&#x27;s founding in 1965.

<text>The German Masters is a professional ranking snooker tournament held at the Tempodrom in Berlin, Germany since 2011, except for 2021, when it was held at Milton Keynes in England because of the COVID-19 pandemic. An earlier ranking event, the German Open, was held in Germany from 1995 to 1997. This was followed by an invitation event, called the German Masters, in 1998. The reigning champion is Kyren Wilson.

== History ==
The tournament started as the German Open and was a ranking tournament from 1995 to 1997. The first event was played in Frankfurt in December 1995, replacing the European Open in the December place in the calendar, the European Open being moved to early 1996. The tournament involved the top 16 players in the world ranking who were joined by 16 qualifiers and 4 wild-card players. The four lowest ranked qualifiers played the wild-card players, winning all their four matches and advancing to the last-32. John Higgins met Ken Doherty in the final. The match was level at three frame each before Higgins won the next six frames to win 9–3 and take the first prize of £40,000. Higgins made a break of 139 in the final to also win the high break prize of £5,000.

The 1996 event was again held in December, at the British military base at Osnabrück. Only 16 players competed in Germany. The final qualifying round in which the top-16 seeds played 16 players from earlier qualifying rounds was played in Preston, Lancashire in November. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan met Alain Robidoux in the final, winning 9–7. O&#x27;Sullivan led 7–3 before Robidoux won the next four frames to level the match at 7–7. O&#x27;Sullivan then won the next two frames to win the match, finishing with a break of 108. Robidoux took the high break prize for a break of 145 in the final.

The 1997 event was held in Bingen am Rhein using the same format as in 1996. The final qualifying round was held in Hereford in September. John Higgins met John Parrott in the final, Higgins led 5–3 lead after the first session and then won the first three frames in the evening session to lead 8–3. Parrott won frame 12 but Higgins finished the match with a break of 105 in the next frame, winning the first prize of £50,000. In 1998 the event was again held at Bingen am Rhein but became an invitation event with 12 players competing. The name of the tournament was changed to German Masters. The winner received £25,000 with all 12 players guaranteed a minimum of £5,000. John Parrott beat Mark Williams 6–4 in the final. Williams led 4–3 but Parrott won the next three to win the match. The event then was discontinued, but returned for the 2010/2011 season as a ranking tournament.

The revived tournament has been held at the Tempodrom in Berlin since the 2011 edition. The trophy was named after former World Snooker Tour director Brandon Parker in 2021. The event had traditionally been run as a five-day event (from Wednesday to Sunday) with the format being a flat-128 player draw and the first two rounds played as qualifiers away from the venue sometime before the main event. The format received occasional criticism over the years, but the 2023 German Masters received notable criticism as a result of many top players failing to reach the main stages of the tournament and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan withdrawing before his first round qualifying match. This led to only four players ranked inside the top 16 appearing in the main draw, two of whom failed to progress beyond the Last 16.

Following those criticisms and with support of the promoter SnookerStars.de, the World Snooker Tour confirmed that the televised stages of the tournament were to be increased from its normal five days to the traditional seven days.

<doc id="667298" wikidata="Q305072" url="?curid=667298" title="Sesiidae">
<text>The Sesiidae or clearwing moths are a diurnal moth family in the order Lepidoptera known for their Batesian mimicry in both appearance and behaviour of various Hymenoptera.

The family consists of 165 genera spread over two subfamilies, containing in total 1525 species and 49 subspecies, most of which occur in the tropics, though there are many species in the Holarctic region as well, including over a hundred species known to occur in Europe.

==Morphology==

Sesiidae are characterized by their hymenopteriform Batesian mimicry, frequently of identifiable species. Most species of Sesiidae have wings with areas where scales are nearly completely absent, resulting in partial, marked transparency. Forewings are commonly elongated and narrow in the basal half. In many species, the abdomen is elongated, with an anal tuft, and striped or ringed yellow, red or white, sometimes very brightly so. Legs are long, thin and frequently coloured, and in some species the hind-legs are elongated. In European species, the wing span ranges from 8 to 48 mm.

Larvae lack pigment. Segments of the thorax are somewhat enlarged.

==Behaviour==

The larvae of the Sesiidae typically bore in wood or burrow in plant roots. Many species are serious pests of fruit-tree or timber cultivation, or crop plants (e.g. &quot;Melittia&quot; spp. on squash) (Edwards et al., 1999). Larval development lasts 1–4 years, pupal stage 10–20 days.

Adults are diurnally active. Specimens are commonly collected using pheromone lures.

Movements, including hovering flight, mimic those of Hymenoptera spp.

<doc id="667304" wikidata="Q66320" url="?curid=667304" title="Over-the-counter (finance)">
<text>Over-the-counter (OTC) or off-exchange trading or pink sheet trading is done directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. It is contrasted with exchange trading, which occurs via exchanges. A stock exchange has the benefit of facilitating liquidity, providing transparency, and maintaining the current market price. In an OTC trade, the price is not necessarily publicly disclosed.

OTC trading, as well as exchange trading, occurs with commodities, financial instruments (including stocks), and derivatives of such products. Products traded on traditional stock exchanges, and other regulated bourse platforms, must be well standardized. This means that exchanged deliverables match a narrow range of quantity, quality, and identity which is defined by the exchange and identical to all transactions of that product. This is necessary for there to be transparency in stock exchange-based equities trading. 

The OTC market does not have this limitation. Parties may agree on an unusual quantity, for example in OTC, market contracts are bilateral (i.e. the contract is only between two parties), and each party could have credit risk concerns with respect to the other party. The OTC derivative market is significant in some asset classes: interest rate, foreign exchange, stocks, and commodities.

In 2008, approximately 16% of all U.S. stock trades were &quot;off-exchange trading&quot;; by April 2014, that number increased to about 40%. Although the notional amount outstanding of OTC derivatives in late 2012 had declined 3.3% over the previous year, the volume of cleared transactions at the end of 2012 totalled US$346.4 trillion. The Bank for International Settlements statistics on OTC derivatives markets showed that &quot;notional amounts outstanding totalled $693 trillion at the end of June 2013... The gross market value of OTC derivatives – that is, the cost of replacing all outstanding contracts at current market prices – declined between end-2012 and end-June 2013, from $25 trillion to $20 trillion.&quot;

== Stocks ==

In the United States, over-the-counter trading in stock is carried out by market makers using inter-dealer quotation services such as OTC Link (a service offered by OTC Markets Group).

Although exchange-listed stocks can be traded OTC on the third market, it is rarely the case. Usually OTC stocks are not listed nor traded on exchanges, and vice versa. Stocks quoted on the OTCBB must comply with certain limited U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. 

The SEC imposes more stringent financial and reporting requirements on other OTC stocks, specifically the OTCQX stocks (traded through the OTC Market Group Inc). Other OTC stocks have no reporting requirements, for example Pink Sheets securities and &quot;gray market&quot; stocks. However, in 2021, the pink sheets market came under the spotlight of greater regulatory scrutiny. 

Some companies, with Wal-Mart as one of the largest, began trading as OTC stocks and eventually upgraded to a listing on fully regulated market. By 1969 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was incorporated. In 1972, with stores in five states, including Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Missouri, Wal-Mart began trading as over-the-counter (OTC) stocks. By 1972 Walmart had earned over US$1 billion in sales — the fastest company to ever accomplish this. In 1972 Wal-Mart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol WMT.

In a 2017 &quot;Kiplinger Personal Finance&quot; article, Dan Burrows wrote that American OTC markets are rife with penny stock fraud and other risks, and should generally be avoided by investors &quot;with the exception of large, established foreign firms&quot;. Reputable companies located outside the U.S., he notes, sometimes sell stock over-the-counter to gain access to American markets while avoiding the expense of keeping two sets of audited paperwork to be listed on multiple stock exchanges (one in their homeland or to international standards, and one for American standards).

== Contracts ==

An over-the-counter is a contract in which two parties (or their brokers or bankers as intermediaries) agree on how a particular trade or agreement is to be settled in the future. It is usually from an investment bank to its clients directly. Forwards and swaps are prime examples of such contracts. It is mostly done online or by telephone. For derivatives, these agreements are usually governed by an International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreement. This segment of the OTC market is occasionally referred to as the &quot;Fourth Market&quot;. Critics have labelled the OTC market as the &quot;dark market&quot; because prices are often unpublished and unregulated.

Over-the-counter derivatives are especially important for hedging risk in that they can be used to create a &quot;perfect hedge&quot;. With exchange traded contracts, standardization does not allow for as much flexibility to hedge risk because the contract is a one-size-fits-all instrument. With OTC derivatives, though, a firm can tailor the contract specifications to best suit its risk exposure.

== Counterparty risk ==

OTC derivatives can lead to significant risks. Especially counterparty risk has gained particular emphasis due to the credit crisis in 2007. Counterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty in a derivatives transaction will default prior to expiration of the trade and will not make the current and future payments required by the contract. There are many ways to limit counterparty risk. One of them focuses on controlling credit exposure with diversification, netting, collateralisation and hedging. Central counterparty clearing of OTC trades has become more common in recent years, with regulators placing pressure on the OTC markets to clear and display trades openly.

In their market review published in 2010, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association examined OTC Derivative Bilateral Collateralization Practice as one way of mitigating risk.

== Importance of OTC derivatives in modern banking ==
OTC derivatives are a significant part of the world of global finance. The OTC derivatives markets grew exponentially from 1980 through 2000. This expansion has been driven by interest rate products, foreign exchange instruments and credit default swaps. The notional outstanding of OTC derivatives markets rose throughout the period and totalled approximately US$601 trillion at December 31, 2010.

In their 2000 paper by Schinasi et al. published by the International Monetary Fund in 2001, the authors observed that the increase in OTC derivatives transactions would have been impossible &quot;without the dramatic advances in information and computer technologies&quot; that occurred from 1980 to 2000. During that time, major internationally active financial institutions significantly increased the share of their earnings from derivatives activities. These institutions manage portfolios of derivatives involving tens of thousands of positions and aggregate global turnover over $1 trillion. At that time prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the OTC market was an informal network of bilateral counter-party relationships and dynamic, time-varying credit exposures whose size and distribution tied to important asset markets. International financial institutions increasingly nurtured the ability to profit from OTC derivatives activities and financial markets participants benefitted from them. In 2000 the authors acknowledged that the growth in OTC transactions &quot;in many ways made possible, the modernization of commercial and investment banking and the globalization of finance&quot;. However, in September, an IMF team led by Mathieson and Schinasi cautioned that &quot;episodes of turbulence&quot; in the late 1990s &quot;revealed the risks posed to market stability originated in features of OTC derivatives instruments and markets.

<text>Common stonechat is the name used for the &quot;Saxicola&quot; species Saxicola torquatus when this is treated in its broad sense.

It is, however, now more widely considered to be a superspecies consisting of several related but distinct species, which are outwardly fairly similar but genetically distinct and replacing each other geographically without significant hybridisation:
* African stonechat &quot;Saxicola torquatus&quot; in the strict sense
* European stonechat &quot;Saxicola rubicola&quot;
* Siberian stonechat &quot;Saxicola maurus&quot;
* Amur stonechat &quot;Saxicola stejnegeri&quot;
* Madagascar stonechat &quot;Saxicola sibilla&quot;

Three other species, not previously included within the broad view of common stonechat, have also been shown to be members of the superspecies:
* Fuerteventura chat &quot;Saxicola dacotiae&quot;
* Reunion stonechat &quot;Saxicola tectes&quot;
* White-tailed stonechat &quot;Saxicola leucurus&quot;

Species status possible, but not yet verified:
* Ethiopian stonechat &quot;Saxicola&quot; (&quot;torquatus&quot;) &quot;albofasciatus&quot;

Not all of the above are currently recognised as full species by all of the relevant taxonomical authorities, for example the British Ornithologists&#x27; Union, currently include &quot;stejnegeri&quot; as a subspecies of &quot;Saxicola maurus&quot;.

<text>The Northern Ireland Open is a professional ranking snooker tournament held in Belfast as part of the four-event Home Nations Series. The players compete for the Alex Higgins Trophy, named for the late two-time world champion who was born and raised in Belfast. The inaugural edition of the tournament was held in 2016 and was won by Mark King.

The reigning champion is Kyren Wilson.

==History==
On 29 April 2015 World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn announced that the &quot;Northern Ireland Open&quot; at a Belfast venue would be added to the main tour in 2016, as part of a new Home Nations Series with the existing Welsh Open and Scottish Open, and the new English Open tournaments.

In 2017, Yan Bingtao became the youngest player to reach a ranking final. Yan came close to breaking Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s record of being the youngest player to win a ranking event, which had stood for 24 years, but he narrowly lost to Mark Williams 8–9 after having led 8–7. This final also featured one of the biggest age gaps between finalists as Williams was almost 25 years older than Yan. Additionally, Yan also became the first player born in the 2000s to reach the final of a ranking tournament.

In 2018, 2019 and 2020, Judd Trump defeated Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 9–7 in each final. The 2020 tournament was staged outside Northern Ireland, at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes, because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom on the 2020–21 snooker season.

In 2021, Mark Allen became the first Northern Irish player to win the event, knocking out defending champion Judd Trump in the quarter-finals and beating John Higgins 9–8 in the final, after trailing 6–8. In 2022, Allen successfully defended the title, coming from 1–4 down to beat Zhou Yuelong 9–4.

In 2023, Judd Trump regained the title for a record-extending fourth time, beating Chris Wakelin 9–3 in the final. Trump reached the final again in 2024 but lost 3–9 to reigning World Champion Kyren Wilson who became the first right-handed player to win the event.

<doc id="667309" wikidata="Q1195848" url="?curid=667309" title="The Moon Is Down">
<text>The Moon Is Down is a novel by American writer John Steinbeck. Fashioned for adaptation for the theatre and for which Steinbeck received the Norwegian King Haakon VII Freedom Cross, it was published by Viking Press in March 1942. The story tells of the military occupation of a small town in Northern Europe by the army of an unnamed nation at war with Great Britain and Russia (much like the occupation of Norway by the Germans during World War II).

A French language translation of the book was published illegally in Nazi-occupied France by Les Éditions de Minuit, a French Resistance publishing house. Numerous other editions were secretly published across occupied Europe, including Norwegian, Danish, Dutch, and Italian versions (as well as a Swedish version); it was the best known work of U.S. literature in the Soviet Union during the war. Although the text never names the occupying force as German, references to &quot;The Leader&quot; as well as &quot;memories of defeats in Belgium and France 20 years ago&quot; clearly suggest it. Written with the purpose of motivating resistance movements in occupied countries, the book has appeared in at least 214 editions throughout the world.

== Plot summary ==
Taken by surprise, a small coastal town is overrun by an invading army with little resistance. The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes their headquarters in the house of Orden, the democratically elected and popular mayor.

As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the &quot;simple, peaceful people&quot; of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that &quot;there are no peaceful people&quot; amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The calm is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and &quot;a free man&quot;, is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pickaxe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a showtrial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into &quot;a slow, silent, waiting revenge.&quot; Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Colonel Lanser that his goal – &quot;to break man&#x27;s spirit permanently&quot; – is impossible.

The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and describe their victories as &quot;the flies have conquered the flypaper.&quot; Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, Colonel Lanser&#x27;s army takes the mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any rebellious action will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden refuses to ask his people to stop active resistance, and feels that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology and Phaedo, a part he played in a high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that resistance continues.

== Adaptations ==
Steinbeck adapted &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; for the stage in 1942. Directed by Chester Erskine, the original Broadway production opened April 7, 1942, at the Martin Beck Theatre. The cast featured Otto Kruger as Colonel Lanser, Ralph Morgan as Mayor Orden, and Whitford Kane as Dr. Winter. Producer Oscar Serlin announced an earlier-than-anticipated closing, explaining that attendance had &quot;withered under the repeated blasting of those critics who did not like the play.&quot; The film rights were sold for $300,000.

King Haakon VII of Norway attended the opening of the London production of &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; June 8, 1943, at Whitehall Theatre. The cast included Paul Scofield in the role of Alex Morden.

&quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; was adapted for a 1943 film directed by Irving Pichel, starring Cedric Hardwicke as Colonel Lanser, Henry Travers as Mayor Orden, and Lee J. Cobb as Dr. Winter.

== Title ==
The title of the book comes from &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Just before Banquo encounters Macbeth on his way to kill Duncan, he asks his son, Fleance, &quot;How goes the night, boy?&quot; Fleance replies, &quot;The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.&quot; (Act II, Scene i).

<doc id="667316" wikidata="Q3031079" url="?curid=667316" title="Alien 8">
<text>Alien 8 is an action-adventure video game developed and published by Ultimate Play the Game. It was released for the ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro, Amstrad CPC and MSX in 1985. The game is a spiritual successor to the best-selling &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, which was lauded by critics for its isometric graphics. In the game, the player takes control of a robot, Alien 8, whose job is to ensure that all of the cryogenically frozen passengers on board a starship remain viable during the ship&#x27;s voyage.

The game was written by Chris Stamper, and graphics were designed by Tim Stamper. &quot;Alien 8&quot; uses the same image masking technique as &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered isometric projection. The game was critically acclaimed upon release. Reviewers praised the game&#x27;s graphics and innovation, while minor criticism was directed at its similarities to &quot;Knight Lore&quot;.

==Plot==
On a dying planet in a distant galaxy, the last of the creatures known as the &quot;guardians&quot; stored all of their libraries, records, and knowledge on a single starship together with cryogenically preserved members of their race. A single robot, Alien 8, is tasked with keeping the occupants of the vessel alive for the duration of its journey.

The ship is launched towards a new solar system and Alien 8 performs his task for thousands of years during the journey. However, as the ship nears its destination, it is attacked and boarded by hostile aliens. The cryogenic life support systems were damaged during the attack and Alien 8 must restore them to an operational status before the ship&#x27;s automatic thrusting systems manoeuvre it into planetary orbit.

==Gameplay==
The game is presented in an isometric format and set on board a starship. Taking on the role of the robot, &quot;Alien 8&quot;, the player must explore the large starship in order to ensure that the cryogenic life support systems preserving the biological crew are re-activated. The core of this system is a series of geometrically-shaped circuits. However, the circuits have been removed by the invading aliens and distributed around the starship. The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.

As with its spiritual predecessor, the environment of the game takes the form of a series of isometric flip-screen rooms (which trace the outline of a large starship). There are a total of 129 rooms and most are filled with various objects, such as moveable platforms, static hazards such as spikes and hostile aliens. As well as executing well-timed manoeuvres and jumps, the player is able to use starship props to block or defend themselves. Another feature is the use of remote controlled drones, which can be directed by Alien 8 into inaccessible or dangerous areas.

==Development==
Development of &quot;Alien 8&quot; began immediately after the release of &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, in which the Stamper brothers predicted that publishers would attempt to copy &quot;Knight Lore&quot; Filmation technology in other games. As with its predecessor, the Stamper brothers developed the game in monochrome to avoid visual overlay and attribute clash, as it was a common processing limitation in early 8-bit home computers. However, the Amstrad release exclusively displayed dual-colours.
In 2019 an unofficial Commodore port was released.

==Reception==
&quot;Alien 8&quot; entered the Gallup Top 30 sales chart at number one for the week ending 19 February 1985, replacing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; after 13 weeks. After a second week at the top, it was replaced by &quot;Football Manager&quot;.

The game was critically acclaimed upon release. A reviewer of &quot;Crash&quot; praised its graphics and presentation, stating them to be &quot;excellent&quot; and more &quot;imaginative and pleasing&quot; compared to its predecessor, despite regarding it as &quot;only having a slight difference&quot;. &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; similarly praised the graphics, citing them as &quot;amazing&quot;, &quot;brilliant&quot; and having &quot;great&quot; colour combinations. A reviewer of &quot;Amtix!&quot; stated that the visuals were &quot;breathtakingly stunning&quot; and improves on its predecessor. David Kelly of &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; stated the game was a &quot;little&quot; disappointing due to its similarities to &quot;Knight Lore&quot;, but asserted that the graphics were of superior quality to its predecessor. Chris Bourne of &quot;Sinclair User&quot; stated that the general quality of graphics were &quot;higher&quot; than its predecessor, although it used an identical system.

&quot;Crash&quot; praised the new additions to the game, in particular the time limit and various collectable items. The reviewer wrote that the new features were &quot;compelling and exciting&quot;, as it differs from its predecessor. A reviewer of &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; similarly praised its innovation, stating that it has &quot;wonderfully&quot; original ideas, despite criticising it similarities to &quot;Knight Lore&quot;. Kelly praised the game&#x27;s extra puzzles and the animation of enemies, heralding them as &quot;brilliant&quot;. Bourne similarly praised the 3D animation, writing that every extension of the game improved over &quot;Knight Lore&quot;.

<doc id="667317" wikidata="Q583183" url="?curid=667317" title="Howard Jones (American singer)">
<text>Howard Jones (born July 20, 1970) is an American metalcore vocalist best known as the former lead singer of Killswitch Engage and Blood Has Been Shed. He is the current vocalist of Light the Torch, formerly known as Devil You Know, and SION with YouTuber/guitarist Jared Dines.

==Career==
Jones started making music in the underground band Driven in 1996, releasing a single album. He later performed with Blood Has Been Shed from 1997 to 2004. In 2002, he joined Killswitch Engage as their new vocalist after Jesse Leach left the band. During his time with Killswitch Engage, they released two gold-certified albums, &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; and &quot;As Daylight Dies&quot;, as well as a second self-titled album. Jones left the band after nearly ten years in 2012, but remained a close friend. He would go on to collaborate with them again for the single &quot;The Signal Fire&quot; from their album &quot;Atonement&quot;. His later band Light the Torch would also tour with Killswitch Engage, and he would appear with the band onstage to perform the song, as well as other songs from his time with them, often as a duet alongside Leach.

Jones started a new band Devil You Know with guitarist Francesco Artusato (All Shall Perish) and drummer John Sankey (Devolved, Fear Factory and Divine Heresy). After Sankey&#x27;s departure and his attempt to claim the copyright of the band&#x27;s name, the rest of the band members started again with a fresh name, Light the Torch, with the addition of a new drummer.

In March 2021, Jones joined with heavy metal YouTuber Jared Dines and producer Hiram Hernandez to release &quot;The Blade&quot; as part of a new project named Sion.

On December 3rd 2024, Jones via his Instagram confirmed that He and former Killswitch Engage bandmate Adam Dutkiewicz were almost finished mixing a Debut Album for their new band called &quot;Burn Eternal&quot;.

==Personal life==
Jones is an avid fisherman and owns property on the Red River of the North in Manitoba, Canada. He is a frequent guest on Jamey Jasta&#x27;s podcast on the GaS Digital Network. Jones left Killswitch Engage in early 2012 to allow himself to manage his type 2 diabetes, which was worsened by a hectic touring lifestyle. In 2013, Jones stated that his diabetes put him in a coma for three days.

In 2015, Jones revealed that he had struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time, which had been worsened by his rise to fame in Killswitch Engage. He revealed that he had come close to committing suicide in 2009, when he had aimed a .44 Magnum revolver at his head in his apartment in Connecticut, and that the police had intervened after being notified by a concerned neighbor. In 2018, he teamed up with his former band to raise awareness for mental health; the resulting song &quot;The Signal Fire&quot; appears on the 2019 album &quot;Atonement&quot;.

Although formerly straight edge, Jones now shares a passion for medical cannabis with friend and fellow Killswitch Engage frontman Jesse Leach.

<text>125 (one hundred [and] twenty-five) is the natural number following 124 and preceding 126.

==In mathematics==
125 is the cube of 5.
It can be expressed as a sum of two squares in two different ways, 125 = 10² + 5² = 11² + 2².

125 and 126 form a Ruth-Aaron pair under the second definition in which repeated prime factors are counted as often as they occur.

Like many other powers of 5, it is a Friedman number in base 10 since 125 = 51 + 2.

125 is the center of a close triplet of perfect powers, (121 = 112, 125 = 53, 128 = 27). Excluding the trivial cases of 0 and 1, the only closer such triplet is (4,8,9) and the only other equally close is (25, 27, 32).

<text>The End of Heartache is the third studio album by American metalcore band Killswitch Engage. It was released on May 11, 2004, through Roadrunner Records. It is the first album to feature lead vocalist Howard Jones and drummer Justin Foley. 

The album combines American-style metalcore with European-style melodic death metal to create &quot;the perfect&quot; melodic metalcore work, according to Metal Sucks. It received positive acclaim from critics.

== Release ==

Two music videos: &quot;Rose of Sharyn&quot; and &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; were filmed in promotion of the album. &quot;Rose of Sharyn&quot; had the group performing in a sunny desert with blood dripping from dead branches to form words. &quot;The End of Heartache&quot; featured a darkly lit performance with various animated imagery with scenes from &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot; dotted throughout. Both videos saw notable airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The band previously played on the 2003 &quot;MTV2 Headbangers Ball Tour&quot;.

A special edition of the album was released in 2005 that contained six additional tracks.

The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 7, 2007.

==Reception==

<text>Bukit China (Malay: &quot;Chinese Hill&quot;; Chinese: 三宝山) is a hillside of historical significance in Malacca City, the capital of the Malaysian state of Malacca. It is located several kilometres to the north from the historical centre of Malacca (Dutch town and Chinatown). The site is today surrounded by the modern city on all sides.

==History==
According to local tradition, in the mid-15th century, the legendary Hang Li Po was sent to be married to the sultan of Malacca, Mansur Shah, to seal relations between the two states. The hill, Bukit Cina, a gift from the sultan, was established as their residence. Marine archaeology of a shipwreck (Royal Nanhai wreck from about 1460 AD) suggested royal gifts from China, shipped during Sultan Mansor Shah&#x27;s reign.

The Well of Perigi Raja, situated next to Poh San Teng Temple (mistakenly known as Sam Po Kong Temple) at the foot of the hill (), was constructed by Hang Li Po&#x27;s followers for her personal use but was also an important source of water for much of the town. It was also a prime target for opposition forces, which either poisoned it or tried to hold it for their own use. It was reputed never to have dried up even during droughts. Today, the well has acquired the reputation of a wishing well and it is believed that anyone who throws a coin into the well will return to Malacca.

Bukit Cina and two adjoining hills today form a Chinese graveyard covering over 250,000 square metres. With over 12,000 graves, some of which date to the Ming Dynasty, it is said to be the largest Chinese graveyard outside China.

==Admiral Zheng He&#x27;s Seven Dragon Wells==
Admiral Zheng He (Cheng Ho)&#x27;s Seven Wells lie in the foot of the Bukit China, beside the Poh San Teng Temple. These wells were dug by Admiral Zheng He&#x27;s expedition force during their stopover in Malacca during the Ming dynasty. Bukit Cina was chosen by Zheng He to be used as the base for his expeditionary force. The Seven Wells are also known as the Dragon&#x27;s wells according to fengshui principles. some of these wells were bulldozed during the 1950-60s for road building. To-date, only three wells are left intact and they have never been dried even in the worst of drought.

Zheng He&#x27;s visit is recorded in verified Chinese history as compared to the fabled lore of Perigi Raja wells. Zheng He, acting under the orders of the Yongle Emperor, escorted Princess Hang Li Poh to be wed to Sultan Mansor Shah, in the 15th century. As a gift to Hang Li Poh and the Chinese settlers in Bukit Cina, Zheng He dug seven wells, which is originally known as the Perigi Raja and mistakenly called &quot;Hang Li Poh&#x27;s well&quot;.

Due to the political and racial tension in the country since 2008, several rumours and disagreement regarding the history of the seven wells and also the existence of Hang Li Poh herself arose. This has contributed to many accusation being thrown to the local government by various NGOs and the opposition as the culprit of making the Malay history more colourful using it as a propaganda tool to gain support from the Chinese community.

However, the accusation by certain parties that the historical details of Zheng He&#x27;s expedition force puts the Malay kingdom&#x27;s sovereignty in a bad light, appeared to be questionable as it is well recorded that Zheng He, who voyaged to Malacca several times, did establish a regional headquarters in Malacca in the 15th century to conduct regional diplomatic and entrepot activities in Southeast Asia due to the close relation between the Chinese empire and the kingdom of Malacca as well as the importance of Malacca as an entrepot in Southeast Asia.

<text>Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club is one of eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Nottinghamshire. The club&#x27;s limited overs team is called the Notts Outlaws.

The county club was founded in 1841, although teams had played first-class cricket under the Nottinghamshire name since 1835. The county club has always held first-class status. Nottinghamshire had competed in the County Championship since the official start of the competition in 1890 and have played in every top-level elite domestic cricket competition in England.

The club plays most of its home games at the Trent Bridge cricket ground in West Bridgford, Nottingham, which is also a venue for Test matches. The club has played matches at numerous other venues in the county.

==History==
Nottingham Cricket Club is known to have played matches from 1771 onwards and 15 matches involving this side have been awarded first-class status from 1826. A single first-class match was played by a combined Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire side in 1803 but the first Nottinghamshire sides played in 1829. Eight matches played by this side between 1835 and 1840 have first-class status.

The formal creation of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club was enacted in March or April 1841 (the exact date has been lost). William Clarke established Trent Bridge as a cricket venue adjacent to the public house he ran. It was Clarke&#x27;s successor as Nottinghamshire captain, George Parr, who first captained a united England touring team in 1859. The club elected its first president, Sir Henry Bromley, in 1869. Early professional greats such as Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury ensured that Notts were a force in the period before 1900. Thanks largely to the outstanding bowling combination of Tom Wass and Albert Hallam, the county won the County Championship in 1907 when George Gunn, John Gunn and Wilfred Payton were also prominent.

Between the wars Notts enjoyed the services of the famous bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce. Strong batting from George Gunn, Arthur Carr and Dodger Whysall saw them emerge as champions in 1929 after losing the title on the final day of the season in 1927. Prior to the second war, opening batsman Walter Keeton gained Test recognition, though the bowling was less effective.

Through the early fifties the team was weak. The signing of the Australian leg break bowler Bruce Dooland, arrested the decline but until the signing of the incomparable Garfield Sobers in 1968, the team was weak. Sobers hit Malcolm Nash of Glamorgan for six sixes in an over in a County Championship game at Swansea in his first season. Mike Harris scored heavily in the 1970s, including nine centuries in 1971 but apart from Barry Stead, the bowling lacked penetration.

Nottinghamshire enjoyed one of their strongest teams in the late seventies and early eighties when the New Zealand all-rounder Richard Hadlee, South African captain Clive Rice and England batsman Derek Randall led the team to the County Championship in 1981. The club&#x27;s most successful season came in 1987, as Rice and Hadlee marked their departure with the double of County Championship and NatWest Trophy. Chris Broad and Tim Robinson continued the club&#x27;s long tradition of batting excellence into the England team but for some years the club struggled to repeat those achievements, although they did claim a Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1989 and a Sunday League title in 1991 under Robinson&#x27;s captaincy. Former Warwickshire off spinner Eddie Hemmings made a significant contribution while local seam bowler Kevin Cooper was a consistent wicket taker.

The following decade was one of underachievement, but in 2004, Nottinghamshire enjoyed a highly successful season, gaining promotion to both the Frizzell County Championship Division One, after winning Division Two, and also Totesport Division One. In 2005, Nottinghamshire won their first County Championship title since 1987, New Zealand&#x27;s Stephen Fleming captaining the team to victory. However, the success was not sustained in 2006 and Notts were relegated by a margin of just half a point, although they had more success in the shorter formats and ended up runners-up on their debut appearance at Twenty20 Cup finals day. In 2007, Notts won promotion back to the top flight of the County Championship, finishing second in Division Two.

In 2008, the first season of Chris Read&#x27;s captaincy, they came close to winning both the County Championship and NatWest Pro40 outright, losing to Hampshire on the final day and Sussex on the final ball respectively.
In 2010, Nottinghamshire made it to Finals Day of the Friends Provident Twenty20 Cup. Drawn against Somerset, Notts lost on the Duckworth Lewis method. However, they won the County Championship on the last day, having lost the preceding two matches, with Somerset in second place tied on points but with one less win. 2013 brought a second major trophy of the Read era with victory in the YB40 one-day competition. While further titles eluded them, Notts remained a fixture in the First Division of the Championship for the next decade under Read&#x27;s long-running captaincy, also featuring a number of England players including Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, Alex Hales, James Taylor and Samit Patel. In 2017, trophy success returned to Notts. Under the captaincy of Australian Dan Christian, they won their first T20 Blast trophy beating Birmingham Bears in the final, whilst in the same season securing the Royal London One-Day Cup with victory over Surrey.

Read, by now only captaining the first-class side, retired in 2017 and was replaced as club captain by Steven Mullaney, with Christian continuing to lead the T20 side. Despite struggles in the longer game, Notts won a second T20 Blast title in 2020, beating Surrey in a rain-affected final.

<doc id="667349" wikidata="Q2335896" url="?curid=667349" title="Dynamic systems development method">
<text>Dynamic systems development method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework, initially used as a software development method. First released in 1994, DSDM originally sought to provide some discipline to the rapid application development (RAD) method. In later versions the DSDM Agile Project Framework was revised and became a generic approach to project management and solution delivery rather than being focused specifically on software development and code creation and could be used for non-IT projects. The DSDM Agile Project Framework covers a wide range of activities across the whole project lifecycle and includes strong foundations and governance, which set it apart from some other Agile methods. The DSDM Agile Project Framework is an iterative and incremental approach that embraces principles of Agile development, including continuous user/customer involvement.

DSDM fixes cost, quality and time at the outset and uses the MoSCoW prioritisation of scope into &quot;musts&quot;, &quot;shoulds&quot;, &quot;coulds&quot; and &quot;will not haves&quot; to adjust the project deliverable to meet the stated time constraint. DSDM is one of a number of agile methods for developing software and non-IT solutions, and it forms a part of the Agile Alliance.

In 2014, DSDM released the latest version of the method in the &#x27;DSDM Agile Project Framework&#x27;. At the same time the new DSDM manual recognised the need to operate alongside other frameworks for service delivery (esp. ITIL) PRINCE2, Managing Successful Programmes, and PMI. The previous version (DSDM 4.2) had only contained guidance on how to use DSDM with extreme programming.

== History ==

In the early 1990s, rapid application development (RAD) was spreading across the IT industry. The user interfaces for software applications were moving from the old green screens to the graphical user interfaces that are used today. New application development tools were coming on the market, such as PowerBuilder. These enabled developers to share their proposed solutions much more easily with their customers – prototyping became a reality and the frustrations of the classical, sequential (waterfall) development methods could be put to one side.

However, the RAD movement was very unstructured: there was no commonly agreed definition of a suitable process and many organizations came up with their own definition and approach. Many major corporations were very interested in the possibilities but they were also concerned that they did not lose the level of quality in the end deliverables that free-flow development could give rise to

The DSDM Consortium was founded in 1994 by an association of vendors and experts in the field of software engineering and was created with the objective of &quot;jointly developing and promoting an independent RAD framework&quot; by combining their best practice experiences. The origins were an event organized by the Butler Group in London. People at that meeting all worked for blue-chip organizations such as British Airways, American Express, Oracle, and Logica (other companies such as Data Sciences and Allied Domecq have since been absorbed by other organizations).

In July 2006, DSDM Public Version 4.2 was made available for individuals to view and use; however, anyone reselling DSDM must still be a member of the not-for-profit consortium.

In 2014, the DSDM handbook was made available online and public. Additionally, templates for DSDM can be downloaded.

In October 2016 the DSDM Consortium rebranded as the Agile Business Consortium (ABC). The Agile Business Consortium is a not-for-profit, vendor-independent organisation which owns and administers the DSDM framework.

== Description ==
DSDM is a vendor-independent approach that recognises that more projects fail because of people problems than technology. DSDM&#x27;s focus is on helping people to work effectively together to achieve the business goals. DSDM is also independent of tools and techniques enabling it to be used in any business and technical environment without tying the business to a particular vendor.

=== Principles ===
There are eight principles underpinning DSDM. These principles direct the team in the attitude they must take and the mindset they must adopt to deliver consistently.

# Focus on the business need
# Deliver on time
# Collaborate
# Never compromise quality
# Build incrementally from firm foundations
# Develop iteratively
# Communicate continuously and clearly
# Demonstrate control

=== Core techniques ===

* Timeboxing: is the approach for completing the project incrementally by breaking it down into splitting the project in portions, each with a fixed budget and a delivery date. For each portion a number of requirements are prioritised and selected. Because time and budget are fixed, the only remaining variables are the requirements. So if a project is running out of time or money the requirements with the lowest priority are omitted. This does not mean that an unfinished product is delivered, because of the Pareto principle that 80% of the project comes from 20% of the system requirements, so as long as those most important 20% of requirements are implemented into the system, the system therefore meets the business needs and that no system is built perfectly in the first try.
* MoSCoW: is a technique for prioritising work items or requirements. It is an acronym that stands for:
**Must have
**Should have
**Could have
**Won&#x27;t have

* Prototyping: refers to the creation of prototypes of the system under development at an early stage of the project. It enables the early discovery of shortcomings in the system and allows future users to &#x27;test-drive&#x27; the system. This way good user involvement is realised, one of the key success factors of DSDM, or any system development project for that matter.
* Testing: helps ensure a solution of good quality, DSDM advocates testing throughout each iteration. Since DSDM is a tool and technique independent method, the project team is free to choose its own test management method.
* Workshop: brings project stakeholders together to discuss requirements, functionalities and mutual understanding. 
* Modeling: helps visualise a business domain and improve understanding. Produces a diagrammatic representation of specific aspects of the system or business area that is being developed.
* Configuration management: with multiple deliverables under development at the same time and being delivered incrementally at the end of each time-box, the deliverables need to be well managed towards completion.

=== Roles ===

There are some roles introduced within DSDM environment. It is important that the project members need to be appointed to different roles before they commence the project. Each role has its own responsibility. The roles are:
* Executive sponsor: So called the &quot;project champion&quot;. An important role from the user organisation who has the ability and responsibility to commit appropriate funds and resources. This role has an ultimate power to make decisions.
* Visionary: The one who has the responsibility to initialise the project by ensuring that essential requirements are found early on. Visionary has the most accurate perception of the business objectives of the system and the project. Another task is to supervise and keep the development process in the right track.
* Ambassador user: Brings the knowledge of the user community into the project, ensures that the developers receive enough user feedback during the development process.
* Advisor user: Can be any user that represents an important viewpoint and brings daily knowledge of the project.
* Project manager: Can be anyone from the user community or IT staff who manages the project in general.
* Technical co-ordinator: Responsible in designing the system architecture and control the technical quality of the project.
* Team leader: Leads their team and ensures that the team works effectively as a whole.
* Solution developer: Interpret the system requirements and model it including developing the deliverable codes and build the prototypes.
* Solution tester: Checks the correctness in a technical extent by performing some testing, raise defects where necessary and retest once fixed. Tester will have to provide some comment and documentation.
* Scribe: Responsible for gathering and recording the requirements, agreements, and decisions made in every workshop.
* Facilitator: Responsible for managing the workshops&#x27; progress, acts as a motivator for preparation and communication.
* Specialist roles: Business architect, quality manager, system integrator, etc.

=== Critical success factors ===
Within DSDM a number of factors are identified as being of great importance to ensure successful projects.

* Factor 1: First there is the acceptance of DSDM by senior management and other employees. This ensures that the different actors of the project are motivated from the start and remain involved throughout the project.
* Factor 2: Directly derived from factor 1: The commitment of the management to ensure end-user involvement. The prototyping approach requires a strong and dedicated involvement by end users to test and judge the functional prototypes.
* Factor 3: The project team has to be composed of skillful members that form a stable union. An important issue is the empowerment of the project team. This means that the team (or one or more of its members) has to possess the power and possibility to make important decisions regarding the project without having to write formal proposals to higher management, which can be very time-consuming. In order to enable the project team to run a successful project, they also need the appropriate technology to conduct the project. This means a development environment, project management tools, etc.
* Factor 4: Finally, DSDM also states that a supportive relationship between customer and vendor is required. This goes for both projects that are realised internally within companies or by external contractors. An aid in ensuring a supporting relationship could be ISPL.

== Comparison to other development frameworks ==
DSDM can be considered as part of a broad range of iterative and incremental development frameworks, especially those supporting agile and object-oriented methods. These include (but are not limited to) scrum, extreme programming (XP), disciplined agile delivery (DAD), and rational unified process (RUP).

Like DSDM, these share the following characteristics: 
* They all prioritise requirements and work though them iteratively, building a system or product in increments. 
* They are tool-independent frameworks. This allows users to fill in the specific steps of the process with their own techniques and software aids of choice.
* The variables in the development are not time/resources, but the requirements. This approach ensures the main goals of DSDM, namely to stay within the deadline and the budget. 
* A strong focus on communication between and the involvement of all the stakeholders in the system. Although this is addressed in other methods, DSDM strongly believes in commitment to the project to ensure a successful outcome.

<text>The Twins () is a 1993 novel by Tessa de Loo about the sisters Lotte and Anna, who are separated at the age of six when their father dies. The story is set during World War II.

In 2002 the book was adapted to a film named &quot;Twin Sisters&quot;.

== Plot ==
In the autumn of 1990, 74-year-old Lotte Goudriaan spends several weeks in the spa town of Spa in the Belgian Ardennes. She suffers from osteoarthritis and the treatment she is taking is intended to relieve her pain. On the third day, she meets a German woman of her age in the restroom of the Thermal Institute. She is also on a cure because of worn joints. The woman turns out to be from Cologne, which is also the city where Lotte was born. It soon becomes clear that the German, Anna Grosalie, is Lotte&#x27;s twin sister. When they were six years old, their parents died shortly after each other. The family then decided that Anna would be raised with an uncle and an aunt in the German countryside, while Lotte would be placed with the family of a cousin of the father in the Netherlands. Due to bad relations within the family, but especially because of the war, the two sisters lost touch with each other. After their forced separation, they only met twice, the last time right after the war.</text><links>

<text>The Irish Masters was a professional snooker tournament. It was founded in 1978, following on from the successful Benson &amp; Hedges Ireland Tournament (alternatively known as the Benson &amp; Hedges Ireland Championship). The final champion of the tournament was Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

==History==
===Early events===
The event started out in 1975 as the Benson &amp; Hedges Challenge Match between Alex Higgins and John Spencer. The match initially carried a £250 prize for the winner and £150 for the runner-up, but both players agreed to a &quot;winner-takes-all&quot; format. Spencer scored two centuries (a 121 and a 109) and despite Higgins leading 7–5, Spencer won four frames in a row to win. In 1976 and 1977 it was expanded to a four-man invitational event, called the Benson &amp; Hedges Ireland Tournament.

===Irish Masters===
In 1978 the tournament was renamed the Irish Masters and continued as an ever-present fixture on the snooker calendar until 2005. Benson &amp; Hedges continued their sponsorship with the tournament being played at Goffs, County Kildare. After tobacco sponsorship was outlawed in the Ireland in 2000, the Irish government funded the event from 2001 and it was subsequently relocated to the Citywest Hotel, Saggart, County Dublin. The tournament was staged on an invitational basis for most of its existence but became a ranking tournament from the 2002/03 season. The event was dropped from the calendar in the 2005/2006 season. In 2007, a three-day invitational event known as the Kilkenny Irish Masters was staged with 16 players. It attracted a strong field with 9 of the world&#x27;s top 16 players taking part, with Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan winning the title.

The tournament was dominated most of all by Steve Davis, who won it eight times. It was won by Irish players on two occasions, Alex Higgins in 1989 and Ken Doherty in 1998. Doherty claimed the title despite losing in the final 3–9 against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, as O&#x27;Sullivan subsequently failed a drugs test after testing positive for cannabis. There was only one official maximum break in the history of the tournament. John Higgins made it in the quarter-finals of the 2000 event against Jimmy White. There has been one further maximum break in 2007 by O&#x27;Sullivan, but it is not included in the list of official maximum breaks, as the table was not to the required standards used on the professional circuit.

<doc id="667361" wikidata="Q102438" url="?curid=667361" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)">
<text>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone (known as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone in the United States, India and Philippines) is a 2001 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus and produced by David Heyman from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. It is based on the 1997 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; by J. K. Rowling. It is the first instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Its story follows Harry&#x27;s first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as he discovers that he is a famous wizard and begins his formal wizarding education.

Warner Bros. Pictures bought the film rights to the book in 1999 for a reported £1 million ($1.65 million). Production began in the United Kingdom in 2000, with Columbus being chosen to helm the film from a short list of directors that included Steven Spielberg and Rob Reiner. Rowling insisted that the entire cast be British and Irish, with the three leads chosen in August 2000 following open casting calls. Filming took place at Leavesden Film Studios and historic buildings around the United Kingdom from September 2000 to March 2001.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was released to cinemas in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 10 and 11 November 2001 for two days of previews. The film opened on 16 November in the United States, Canada, and Taiwan as well as officially in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It became a critical and commercial success, grossing $974 million at the worldwide box office during its initial run, and over $1 billion with subsequent re-releases. It became the highest-grossing film of 2001 and the second-highest-grossing film at the time. The film was nominated for many awards, including Academy Awards for Best Original Score, Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. It was followed by seven sequels, beginning with &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; in 2002 and ending with &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; in 2011.

==Plot==

Professors Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall and gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry deliver the orphan, Harry Potter, to his only living relatives, the Dursleys. Harry grows up, unaware that he is a wizard and is led to believe his parents were killed in a car crash.

10 years later, owls begin delivering letters addressed to Harry. To prevent them, the Dursleys drag Harry to a deserted cabin where Hagrid arrives, confirming that Harry is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts, having been lied to by the Dursleys. Hagrid brings Harry to Diagon Alley to purchase his school supplies, and buys him a snowy owl whom Harry names Hedwig. Harry’s chosen wand that shares the same feather as Lord Voldemort, the dark wizard. Hagrid tells Harry that he murdered his parents. When Voldemort tried to kill Harry, his curse rebounded, leaving Harry with only a scar. Voldemort was defeated, for which Harry became famous. 

On the Hogwarts Express, Harry befriends Ron Weasley, a pure-blood wizard from a poor family, and Hermione Granger, a Muggle-born. He rivals Draco Malfoy, who is hostile toward Ron due to his status. The first-year students are sorted into four houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, known for producing dark wizards. Harry, Ron, and Hermione join Gryffindor, while Malfoy goes to Slytherin. 

Harry becomes the seeker for Gryffindor after McGonagall sees his flying skills while retrieving Neville&#x27;s Remembrall from Malfoy. Harry, Ron, and Hermione find the forbidden corridor guarded by a three-headed dog, Fluffy. After Ron insults Hermione on Halloween, she retreats to the girls’ bathroom. At the feast, Professor Quirrell announces that a mountain troll has entered the school. Harry and Ron save Hermione, and she lies to McGonagall, claiming she was looking for the troll and they rescued her, saving Ron and Harry from punishment.

Harry suspects that Professor Snape, head of Slytherin, let a troll steal what Fluffy guards after he sees Snape limping. During Harry’s first Quidditch match, his broom acts wildly; Hermione and Ron suspect Snape is jinxing it as he stares at Harry, mouthing a curse. To distract him, Hermione secretly sets his robes on fire. Hagrid doubts their claims. When the trio expresses that Snape intended to bypass Fluffy, Hagrid unintentionally reveals that Fluffy guards something known only to Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel. 

Harry and Ron spend Christmas together, where Harry receives the Cloak of Invisibility and discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows one&#x27;s deepest desire. Dumbledore warns him about its dangers. When Hermione returns, they learn that Nicholas Flamel created the philosopher’s stone, granting immortality and guarded by Fluffy while Snape seeks it. Hagrid receives a dragon egg and sends Norbert to Romania. In detention, Harry is attacked by a hooded creature feeding on unicorns, but is saved by a centaur named Firenze, who reveals the creature is Voldemort, seeking immortality through the stone. The trio suspects Snape of stealing the stone for Voldemort. 

The trio learns from Hagrid that music helps them pass Fluffy. They suspect Snape is the stranger Hagrid met. That night, realizing Dumbledore has gone to London, they descend the trapdoor to confront Snape. After getting past Fluffy, they face three challenges: devil&#x27;s snare, flying keys, and an enchanted chessboard. Ron gets injured in the third challenge, so Hermione tends to him while Harry confronts Snape, who is actually Quirrell. Quirrell reveals he tried to kill Harry and that Snape was protecting him. He shows Voldemort&#x27;s weakened form on the back of his head, trying to force Harry to give him the stone. Harry refuses, prompting Voldemort to order Quirrell to kill him. Harry’s touch incinerates Quirrell, leading to his death and Voldemort’s spirit escaping. 

In the hospital wing, Dumbledore informs Harry that the stone is destroyed and explains why he defeated Quirrell easily; his mother’s sacrifice left a protective mark. At the end-of-term feast, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville earn house points, enabling Gryffindor to win the cup despite Slytherin’s early lead. As summer nears, Harry is happy to have found a real home at Hogwarts.

==Cast==
* Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter: An 11-year-old orphan living with his unwelcoming aunt, uncle, and cousin, who learns of his own fame as a wizard known to have survived his parents&#x27; murder at the hands of the dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant when he is accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Columbus had wanted Radcliffe for the role since he saw him in the BBC&#x27;s production of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; before the open casting sessions had taken place but had been told by casting director Susan Figgis that Radcliffe&#x27;s protective parents would not allow their son to take part. Columbus explained that his persistence in giving Radcliffe the role was responsible for Figgis&#x27; resignation. Radcliffe was asked to audition in 2000 when Heyman and Kloves met him and his parents at a production of &quot;Stones in His Pockets&quot; in London. Heyman and Columbus successfully managed to convince Radcliffe&#x27;s parents that their son would be protected from media intrusion. They agreed to let him play Harry. Rowling approved of Radcliffe&#x27;s casting, stating that &quot;having seen [his] screen test I don&#x27;t think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.&quot; Radcliffe was reportedly paid £1 million for the film, although he felt the fee was &quot;not that important&quot; to him. The Saunders triplets appear as Harry as a baby.
* Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley: Harry&#x27;s best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family. A fan of the series, Grint decided he would be perfect for the part &quot;because [he has] ginger hair&quot;. Having seen a &quot;Newsround&quot; report about the open casting he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the part. His attempt was successful as the casting team asked for a meeting with him. 
* Emma Watson as Hermione Granger: Harry&#x27;s other best friend and the trio&#x27;s brains. Watson&#x27;s Oxford theatre teacher passed her name on to the casting agents and she had to do over five interviews before she got the part. Watson took her audition seriously, but &quot;never really thought [she] had any chance of getting the role.&quot; The producers were impressed by Watson&#x27;s self-confidence and she outperformed the thousands of other girls who had applied. 
* John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick: The ghost of Gryffindor House.
* Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid: A half-giant and Hogwarts&#x27; gamekeeper. Coltrane was one of the two actors Rowling wanted most, along with Smith as McGonagall. Coltrane, who was already a fan of the books, prepared for the role by discussing Hagrid&#x27;s past and future with Rowling.
* Warwick Davis as Filius Flitwick: The Charms Master and head of Ravenclaw House. Davis also plays two other roles in the film: the Goblin Head Teller at Gringotts, and dubs the voice of Griphook, who is embodied by Verne Troyer.
* Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley: Harry&#x27;s Muggle uncle.
* Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore: Hogwarts&#x27; Headmaster and one of the most famous and powerful wizards of all time. Harris initially rejected the role, only to reverse his decision after his granddaughter stated she would never speak to him again if he did not take it.
* Ian Hart as Quirinus Quirrell: The stuttering Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Hart also voiced Lord Voldemort, while Richard Bremmer provided his physical appearance and portrayed him as a hooded figure during a flashback.
* John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander: a highly regarded wandmaker and the owner of Ollivanders.
* Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: The Potions Master and head of Slytherin House. 
* Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley: Harry&#x27;s Muggle aunt.
* Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall: The Deputy Headmistress, head of Gryffindor and transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts. Smith was one of the two actors Rowling wanted most, along with Coltrane as Hagrid.
* Julie Walters as Molly Weasley: Ron&#x27;s mother. She shows Harry how to get to Platform .

Additionally, Zoë Wanamaker appears as Madame Hooch, Hogwarts&#x27; flying instructor and Quidditch referee; Tom Felton portrays Draco Malfoy, a student in Slytherin and Harry&#x27;s rival. Harry Melling plays Dudley Dursley, Harry&#x27;s Muggle cousin; and David Bradley appears as Argus Filch, Hogwarts&#x27; caretaker. Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray and Alfred Enoch portray Neville Longbottom, Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas respectively, three first year students in Gryffindor; James and Oliver Phelps play twins Fred and George Weasley, Ron&#x27;s brothers, while Chris Rankin appears as his other brother Percy, a Gryffindor prefect, and Bonnie Wright appears as Ron&#x27;s sister Ginny. Sean Biggerstaff portrays Oliver Wood, the Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team; Jamie Waylett and Joshua Herdman play Crabbe and Goyle, Malfoy&#x27;s minions; and Leslie Phillips voices the Sorting Hat. Derek Deadman plays Tom, innkeeper of The Leaky Cauldron; and Elizabeth Spriggs appears as the Fat Lady, a painting at Hogwarts. Jean Southern plays dimpled woman on train.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1997, producer David Heyman searched for a children&#x27;s book that could be adapted into a well-received film. He had planned to produce Diana Wynne Jones&#x27; novel &quot;The Ogre Downstairs&quot;, but his plans fell through. His staff at Heyday Films then suggested &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, which his assistant believed was &quot;a cool idea.&quot; Heyman pitched the idea to Warner Bros. and in 1999, Rowling sold the company the rights to the first four &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books for a reported £1million. A demand Rowling made was for Heyman to keep the cast strictly British and Irish; the latter&#x27;s case has Richard Harris as Dumbledore and Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley, and not to cast foreign actors unless absolutely necessary, like casting of French and Eastern European actors in &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; (2005) where characters from the book are specified as such. Rowling was hesitant to sell the rights because she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to give them control over the rest of the story&quot; by selling the rights to the characters, which would have enabled Warner Bros. to make non-author-written sequels.

Although Steven Spielberg initially negotiated to direct the film, he declined the offer. Spielberg reportedly wanted the adaptation to be an animated film, with American actor Haley Joel Osment to provide Harry Potter&#x27;s voice, or a film that incorporated elements from subsequent books as well. Spielberg contended that, in his opinion, it was like &quot;shooting ducks in a barrel. It&#x27;s just a slam dunk. It&#x27;s just like withdrawing a billion dollars and putting it into your personal bank accounts. There&#x27;s no challenge.&quot; Rowling maintains that she had no role in choosing directors for the films and that &quot;[a]nyone who thinks I could (or would) have &#x27;veto-ed&#x27; him [Spielberg] needs their Quick-Quotes Quill serviced.&quot; Heyman recalled that Spielberg decided to direct &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; instead. In a 2023 interview, Spielberg stated that he turned down the project so he could spend time with his family.
After Spielberg left, talks began with other directors, including Chris Columbus, Terry Gilliam, Jonathan Demme, Mike Newell (who would later direct the fourth film), Alan Parker, Wolfgang Petersen, Rob Reiner, Ivan Reitman, Tim Robbins, Brad Silberling, M. Night Shyamalan, David Fincher and Peter Weir. Shyamalan declined as he already working on &quot;Signs&quot; (2002). Petersen and Reiner both pulled out of the running in March 2000, and the choice was narrowed down to Silberling, Columbus, Parker and Gilliam. 

Rowling&#x27;s first choice director was Terry Gilliam, but Warner Bros. chose Columbus, citing his work on other family films such as &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993) as influences for their decision. Columbus had become a fan of the book series after his daughter persuaded him to read the first three books, leading him to call his agent to arrange a meeting at Warner Bros. to direct the film. When his agent told him that at least 25 other directors were eager to helm the project, Columbus requested his agent to secure his meeting to be the last one so he could give a &quot;lasting impression&quot; and be the studio&#x27;s &quot;freshest person in their memory&quot;. 

During two weeks of waiting, Columbus wrote a 130-page director&#x27;s version of the screenplay to explain his vision for the film&#x27;s tone. The day of his meeting with Warner Bros. executives including Alan F. Horn, Columbus delivered an &quot;impassioned 45-minute talk&quot; and showed them his annotated script. Weeks later, the studio notified Columbus that he had got the job and sent him to Scotland to meet with Rowling and Heyman. Columbus pitched his vision of the film for two hours, stating that he wanted the Muggle scenes &quot;to be bleak and dreary&quot; but those set in the wizarding world &quot;to be steeped in color, mood, and detail.&quot; He took inspiration from David Lean&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; (1946) and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), wishing to use &quot;that sort of darkness, that sort of edge, that quality to the cinematography,&quot; while being further inspired by the colour designs from &quot;Oliver!&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972).

Steve Kloves was selected to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as &quot;tough&quot;, as it did not &quot;lend itself to adaptation as well as the next two books.&quot; Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he &quot;almost never read&quot;, but &quot;Harry Potter&quot; jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to &quot;[destroy] her baby.&quot; Rowling admitted that she &quot;was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves,&quot; but recalled her initial meeting with him: &quot;The first time I met him, he said to me, &#x27;You know who my favourite character is?&#x27; And I thought, You&#x27;re gonna say Ron. I know you&#x27;re gonna say Ron. But he said &#x27;Hermione.&#x27; And I just kind of melted.&quot; Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.

Warner Bros. had initially planned to release the film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out of the running. Due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.

===Casting===
Rowling insisted that the cast be kept British. Susie Figgis was appointed as casting director, working with both Columbus and Rowling in auditioning the lead roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Open casting calls were held for the main three roles, with only British children being considered. The principal auditions took place in three parts, with those auditioning having to read a page from the novel, then to improvise a scene of the students&#x27; arrival at Hogwarts, and finally to read several pages from the script in front of Columbus. Scenes from Columbus&#x27; script for &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985) were also used in auditions. On 11 July 2000, Figgis left the production, complaining that Columbus did not consider any of the thousands of children they had auditioned &quot;worthy&quot;. She ended up quitting over disagreements with Columbus over who should play the titular character, as Columbus wanted to cast Americans for Harry and the other roles, with rumors that Columbus was thinking on casting Joel Osment or Jake Lloyd from &quot;Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) to play Harry. 

By August 2000, Alan Rickman and Richard Harris were in final talks to play Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore, respectively, and were confirmed later that month. Tim Roth was the original choice for Snape, but he turned it down for &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (2001). Sean Connery and Christopher Lee were offered the role of Dumbledore, but both declined. Lee turned it down for &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001). Patrick McGoohan was also offered the role, which he declined citing health reasons. 

On 14 August 2000, Rowling&#x27;s favourites Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane were cast as Minerva McGonagall and Rubeus Hagrid. According to Figgis, Robin Williams was interested in playing the role of Hagrid, but was turned down for the role because of the &quot;strictly British and Irish only&quot; rule which Columbus was determined to maintain. On 21 August 2000, Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively. According to Columbus, Harry was the hardest role to cast. Hundreds of young stars auditioned for Harry, including Liam Aiken, Jamie Campbell Bower, Tom Felton (who also auditioned for Ron, and was later cast as Draco Malfoy), Nicholas Hoult, William Moseley, and Jack Whitehall. Aiken was reported as being a frontrunner for the role, having worked with Columbus on the film &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998). However Rowling was firm on her British actors only rule, and even called Columbus to confirm that Aiken would not be cast. Gabriel Thomson was also initially reported as having been given the role, though this would be proven untrue upon the casting of Radcliffe. 

Hatty Jones, who starred in the title role in &quot;Madeline&quot; (1998), was considered for the role of Hermione Granger and had auditioned alongside Watson; she was later deemed outgrown. Katy B also auditioned for Hermione, with Thomas Brodie-Sangster auditioning for the role of Ron. 

In November 2000, Julie Walters and John Cleese joined the cast as Molly Weasley and Nearly-Headless Nick, respectively. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell met with Columbus to express her interest in playing the role of Molly, but was, like Williams and Aiken, turned away over the British only rule. David Thewlis auditioned for Quirinus Quirrell; he would later be cast as Remus Lupin in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004). Rowling herself was considered for Lily Evans; Harry&#x27;s mother, but she turned down the role so Geraldine Somerville was cast.

===Filming===

Two British film industry officials requested that the film be shot in the United Kingdom, offering their assistance in securing filming locations, the use of Leavesden Film Studios, as well as changing the UK&#x27;s child labour laws (adding a small number of working hours per week and making the timing of on-set classes more flexible). Warner Bros. accepted their proposal. 

Principal photography began on 29 September 2000 at Leavesden Film Studios. Filming at the North Yorkshire&#x27;s Goathland railway station took place on 2 October 2000. Canterbury Cathedral and Scotland&#x27;s Inverailort Castle were both touted as possible locations for Hogwarts; Canterbury rejected Warner Bros. proposal due to concerns about the film&#x27;s &quot;pagan&quot; theme. Alnwick Castle and Gloucester Cathedral were eventually selected as the principal locations for Hogwarts, with some scenes also being filmed at Harrow School. Other Hogwarts scenes were filmed in Durham Cathedral over a two-week period; these included shots of the corridors and some classroom scenes. Oxford University&#x27;s Divinity School served as the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, and Duke Humfrey&#x27;s Library, part of the Bodleian, was used as the Hogwarts Library. 

Filming for Privet Drive took place on Picket Post Close in Bracknell, Berkshire. Filming in the street took two days instead of the planned single day, so payments to the street&#x27;s residents were correspondingly increased. For all the subsequent film&#x27;s scenes set in Privet Drive, filming took place on a constructed set in Leavesden Film Studios, which proved to be cheaper than filming on location. London&#x27;s Australia House was selected as the location for Gringotts Wizarding Bank, while Christ Church, Oxford, was the location for the Hogwarts trophy room. London Zoo&#x27;s Reptile House was used as the location for the scene in which Harry accidentally sets a snake on Dudley, with King&#x27;s Cross Station also being used as the book specifies. Filming concluded on 23 March 2001, with final work being done in July 2001.
Because the American title was different, all scenes that mention the philosopher&#x27;s stone by name had to be shot twice, once with the actors saying &quot;philosopher&#x27;s&quot; and once with &quot;sorcerer&#x27;s&quot;. The children filmed for four hours and then did three hours of schoolwork. They developed a liking for fake facial injuries from the makeup staff. Radcliffe was initially meant to wear green contact lenses as his eyes are blue, and not green like Harry&#x27;s, but the lenses gave Radcliffe extreme irritation. Upon consultation with Rowling, it was agreed that Harry could have blue eyes. Radcliffe said that the first time he put on the glasses it set off his allergies.

Columbus said the film had a lot of cuts and was filmed with multiple cameras because he had trouble getting the young cast to &quot;stop smiling&quot; into the camera.

The steam engine used in the film as the Hogwarts Express was GWR 4900 Class 5972 &quot;Olton Hall&quot;, but it was originally not the first locomotive to be selected as the Hogwarts Express. To promote the books, the Southern Railway locomotive 34027 &quot;Taw Valley&quot; was repainted and renamed temporarily, but was rejected by director Chris Columbus as looking &#x27;too modern&#x27; for the film.

===Design and special effects===
Judianna Makovsky served as the costume designer. She re-designed the Quidditch robes, having initially planned to use those shown on the cover of the American book, but deemed them &quot;a mess.&quot; Instead, she dressed the Quidditch players in &quot;preppie sweaters, 19th-century fencing breeches and arm guards.&quot; Production designer Stuart Craig built the sets at Leavesden Studios, including Hogwarts Great Hall, basing it on many English cathedrals. Although originally asked to use an existing old street to film the Diagon Alley scenes, Craig decided to build his own set, comprising Tudor, Georgian and Queen Anne architecture.

Columbus originally planned to use both animatronics and CGI animation to create the magical creatures, including Fluffy. Nick Dudman, who worked on &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, was given the task of creating the needed prosthetics, with Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop providing creature effects. John Coppinger stated that the magical creatures that needed to be created had to be designed multiple times. The film features nearly 600 special effects shots, involving numerous companies. Industrial Light &amp; Magic created Lord Voldemort&#x27;s face on the back of Quirrell, Rhythm &amp; Hues animated Norbert (Hagrid&#x27;s baby dragon); and Sony Pictures Imageworks produced the Quidditch scenes.

===Music===
James Horner was initially sought to compose the score, but declined the opportunity. Having previously collaborated with Columbus on the &quot;Home Alone&quot; films and &quot;Stepmom&quot;, John Williams was selected to compose the score in August 2000. Williams composed the score at his homes in Los Angeles and Tanglewood before recording it in London in September 2001. One of the main themes is entitled &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;; Williams retained it for his finished score as &quot;everyone seemed to like it,&quot; and it became a recurring theme throughout the series.

==Differences from the book==

Columbus repeatedly checked with Rowling to make sure he was getting minor details correct. Kloves described the film as being &quot;really faithful&quot; to the book. He added dialogue, of which Rowling approved. One of the lines originally included had to be removed after Rowling told him that it would directly contradict an event in the then-unreleased fifth &quot;Harry Potter&quot; novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;.

Several minor characters were removed from the film version, most prominently Peeves the poltergeist. Rik Mayall was cast, but his scenes were cut and never released. The book&#x27;s first chapter, told from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley, is absent from the film. Harry and Draco&#x27;s first encounter in Madam Malkin&#x27;s robe shop and the midnight duel are not in the film. In the film, the responsibility of taking Norbert away is given to Dumbledore, while in the book, Harry and Hermione have to bring him by hand to Charlie Weasley&#x27;s friends. This necessitated a change in the detention plotline: in the book, Filch catches Harry and Hermione leaving the Astronomy Tower and puts them in detention with Neville and Malfoy, while in the film, all three protagonists receive detention after Malfoy finds them in Hagrid&#x27;s hut after hours. According to Kloves, this was &quot;the one part of the book that [Rowling] felt easily could be changed&quot;. The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.

The book&#x27;s timeline is not enforced in the film. In the book, Harry&#x27;s eleventh birthday is in 1991. On the film set for 4 Privet Drive, Dudley&#x27;s certificates from primary school bear the year 2001.

==Distribution==
===Marketing===
The first teaser poster of the film was released on 1 December 2000. The first teaser trailer was released via satellite on 2 March 2001 and debuted in cinemas with the release of &quot;See Spot Run&quot;. A video game based on the film was released on 15 November 2001 by Electronic Arts for several consoles. A port for the game, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, was released in 2003. Mattel won the rights to produce toys based on the film, to be sold exclusively through Warner Brothers&#x27; stores. Hasbro also produced products, including confectionery products based on those from the series. Warner Bros. signed a deal worth US$150million with Coca-Cola to promote the film, although some pegged the deal at $40 million-$50 million worldwide for the movie. Lego produced a series of sets based on buildings and scenes from the film, as well as a &quot;Lego Creator&quot; video game.

===Theatrical release===

==Reception==
===Box office===

It grossed a record £3.1million for a Sunday, bringing its total to £6.7million from the previews. It broke the record for the highest-opening weekend ever, both including and excluding previews, making £16.3million with and £9.6million without previews ($13.8 million), setting a further record single day gross on the Saturday with £3.99million. It set another Sunday record with a gross of £3.6million. It had a record second weekend of £8.4 million. It remained at number one in the UK for five weeks. The film went on to make £66.1million in the UK alone, making it the country&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film of all-time (after &quot;Titanic&quot;), until it was surpassed by &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;.

In the United States and Canada, it made $32.3million on its opening day, breaking the single-day record previously held by &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999). On the second day of release, the film&#x27;s gross increased to $33.5million, breaking the record for biggest single day again. It made $90.3million during its first weekend, breaking the record for highest-opening weekend of all time that was previously held by &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997). It held the record until the following May when &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) made $114.8million in its opening weekend. Plus, the film broke &quot;Batman Forever&quot;″s record for having the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film. It would hold this record for two years until it was surpassed by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; (2003). Additionally, it shattered other opening records, surpassing &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; for having the biggest November opening weekend, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; for having the largest non-holiday opening weekend, the highest Friday gross and the biggest opening weekend of the year, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; for scoring the highest Saturday gross, &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992) for having the highest opening weekend for a Chris Columbus film and &quot;&quot; (2000) for having the largest number of screenings, playing at 3,672 theaters. In just five days, it became the fastest film to approach the $100million mark. The film grossed $2.3 million in its first two days in Taiwan, giving it a worldwide opening weekend total of $107 million. The film held onto the number 1 spot at the US box office for three consecutive weekends before getting overtaken by &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;. The film also had the highest-grossing 5-day (Wednesday-Sunday) Thanksgiving weekend record of $82.4million, holding the title for twelve years until both &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; (2013) and &quot;Frozen&quot; (2013) surpassed it with $110.1million and $94million respectively. By Christmas, it went on to become the highest-grossing film of the year, dethroning &quot;Shrek&quot;.

Similar results were achieved across the world. A week after opening in the United States, the film added 15 additional markets and set an opening week record in Germany, grossing $18.7 million. It also set opening records in Austria, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and German-speaking Switzerland. In the following weekend, after expanding to 31 countries, the film set a record overseas weekend gross of $60.9 million, including record openings in Australia, Greece, Israel, Japan ($12.5 million), New Zealand and Spain. It set another overseas weekend record with $62.3 million from 37 countries the following weekend, including record openings in France, Italy and French-speaking Switzerland. The international opening weekend record would be held until it was given to &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) a year later. During its theatrical run, the film earned $974million at the worldwide box office, $317million of that in the US and $657million elsewhere, which made it the second-highest-grossing film in history at the time, as well as the year&#x27;s highest-grossing film. In addition, it surpassed &quot;Twister&quot; (1996) to become the highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of all time. It is the second-highest-grossing &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film after &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 55.9million tickets in the US and Canada.

In August 2020, &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was re-released in several countries, including a 4K 3D restoration in China, where it earned $26.4million, for a global $1.026billion, making it the second film in the series to surpass the billion-dollar mark, after &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#x27;s Stone&quot; adapts its source material faithfully while condensing the novel&#x27;s overstuffed narrative into an involving – and often downright exciting – big-screen magical caper.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert called &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; &quot;a classic,&quot; giving the film four out of four stars, and particularly praising the Quidditch scenes&#x27; visual effects. Praise was echoed by both &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Empire&quot; reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film&#x27;s &quot;stand-out sequence&quot;. Brian Linder of &quot;IGN&quot; also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it &quot;isn&#x27;t perfect, but for me it&#x27;s a nice supplement to a book series that I love&quot;. Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of &quot;Palo Alto Online&quot; stated that the film would &quot;enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film three out of four stars, especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane&#x27;s portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised John Williams&#x27; music, stating the &quot;overly insistent score lacks subtlety and bludgeons us with crescendos&quot;, and concluded that &quot;ultimately many of the book&#x27;s readers may wish for a more magical incarnation.&quot;

The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, although he deemed John Williams&#x27; score &quot;a great clanging, banging music box that simply will not shut up.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; compared the film positively with &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and put &quot;The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine.&quot; Jonathan Foreman of the &quot;New York Post&quot; recalled that the film was &quot;remarkably faithful,&quot; to its literary counterpart as well as a &quot;consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation.&quot;

Richard Corliss, of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, considered the film a &quot;by the numbers adaptation,&quot; criticising the pace and the &quot;charisma-free&quot; lead actors. CNN&#x27;s Paul Tatara found that Columbus and Kloves &quot;are so careful to avoid offending anyone by excising a passage from the book, the so-called narrative is more like a jamboree inside Rowling&#x27;s head.&quot; Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wished that the film had been directed by Tim Burton, finding the cinematography &quot;bland and muggy,&quot; and the majority of the film a &quot;solidly dull celebration of dribbling goo.&quot; Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was highly negative about the film, saying &quot;[the film] is like a theme park that&#x27;s a few years past its prime; the rides clatter and groan with metal fatigue every time they take a curve.&quot; He also said it suffered from &quot;a lack of imagination&quot; and wooden characters, adding, &quot;The Sorting Hat has more personality than anything else in the movie.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; received three Academy Award nominations: Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Original Score for John Williams. The film was also nominated for seven BAFTA Awards: Best British Film, Best Supporting Actor for Robbie Coltrane, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hair, Best Sound, and Best Visual Effects. It won a Saturn Award for Best Costume, and was nominated for eight more awards. It won other awards from the Casting Society of America and the Costume Designers Guild. It was nominated for the AFI Film Award for its special effects, and the Art Directors Guild Award for its production design. It received the Broadcast Film Critics Award for Best Family Film, and was nominated for Best Child Performance (for Daniel Radcliffe) and Best Composer. In 2005, the American Film Institute nominated the film for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

<doc id="667368" wikidata="Q102244" url="?curid=667368" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">
<text>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a 2002 fantasy film directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. It is based on the 1998 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; by J. K. Rowling. Produced by David Heyman, it is the sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and the second instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry&#x27;s second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the Heir of Salazar Slytherin opens the Chamber of Secrets, unleashing a monster that petrifies the school&#x27;s students.

The film was released in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 November 2002, by Warner Bros. Pictures. Critics praised its darker plot, sets, performances (especially Branagh, Coltrane and Isaacs), and a story appropriate for a young audience, and it became a critical and commercial success, grossing $878 million worldwide (domestic 29.7% and foreign 70.2%) and becoming the second-highest-grossing film of 2002. The film was nominated for many awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. It was followed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004).

==Plot==
While spending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, a house-elf who warns him not to return to Hogwarts or danger will strike. When Harry refuses, Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock up Harry to prevent his departure. Harry&#x27;s friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father&#x27;s flying car.

In Diagon Alley, Harry, the Weasleys and Hermione Granger notice a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart, Hogwarts&#x27; new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, Harry sees Draco Malfoy&#x27;s father, Lucius, slip a book into Ginny Weasley&#x27;s cauldron. After being blocked from entering Platform Nine and Three-Quarters at King&#x27;s Cross railway station, Harry and Ron take the car to Hogwarts. They crash into the Whomping Willow, breaking Ron&#x27;s wand, and receive detention.

In detention, Harry hears a strange voice and later finds caretaker Argus Filch&#x27;s cat, Mrs Norris, petrified with a message written in blood: &quot;The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, enemies of the heir... beware.&quot; One of Hogwarts&#x27; founders, Salazar Slytherin, supposedly constructed a secret Chamber containing a monster that only his heir can control, capable of purging the school of Muggle-borns. To solve this mystery, Harry, Ron, and Hermione plan to question Malfoy, using polyjuice potion, which they brew in a bathroom haunted by Moaning Myrtle, a ghost.

During a Quidditch game, Harry&#x27;s arm is broken by a rogue Bludger. Dobby visits him in the infirmary and reveals that he closed the barrier to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and made the Bludger chase Harry to force him to leave the school. He also reveals that the Chamber had been opened in the past. When Harry communicates with a snake, the school starts to believe he is the heir. Disguised Malfoy&#x27;s friends, Harry and Ron learn he is not the heir, but know that a Muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former student Tom Marvolo Riddle, who opened the Chamber and blamed Rubeus Hagrid, leading to his expulsion. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. Professor Dumbledore, Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge, and Lucius arrive to take Hagrid to Azkaban and remove Dumbledore from office, but he discreetly tells the boys to &quot;follow the spiders&quot;. In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid&#x27;s giant pet spider, Aragog, who reveals Hagrid&#x27;s innocence and provides a small clue of the Chamber&#x27;s monster.

A book page in Hermione&#x27;s hand identifies the monster as a basilisk, a giant serpent that kills people who make direct eye contact; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learns Ginny has been taken into the Chamber, and nominate Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart preparing to flee, exposing him as a fraud. Deducing that Myrtle was the Muggle-born girl that the basilisk killed, they find the Chamber&#x27;s entrance in the bathroom she haunts. Once inside, Lockhart tries to erase Harry and Ron’s memory so he can document this as his own adventure. However, because he seized Ron&#x27;s broken wand, the spell backfires, erasing Lockhart&#x27;s memory and causing a cave-in, separating Harry from Ron and Lockhart.

Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious and Riddle, who turns out to be Slytherin&#x27;s heir and Voldemort&#x27;s younger self; he used the diary to manipulate Ginny into reopening the Chamber. After Harry expresses his loyalty to Dumbledore, the latter&#x27;s pet phoenix Fawkes arrives with the Sorting Hat, causing Riddle to summon the basilisk. Fawkes blinds the basilisk, and the Sorting Hat produces the Sword of Gryffindor, which Harry uses to kill the basilisk but is poisoned by one of its fangs.

Despite being injured, Harry stabs the diary with the basilisk fang, destroying Riddle and reviving Ginny. Fawkes&#x27;s tears heal Harry, who returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. This earns Dumbledore&#x27;s praise and Hagrid&#x27;s release. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby&#x27;s master, of planting the diary in Ginny&#x27;s cauldron and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The basilisk&#x27;s victims are healed, Hermione reunites with her friends, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban.

Hugh Grant was rumoured to be the first choice to play the role of Gilderoy Lockhart, but due to reported scheduling conflicts he was unable to play the character. Columbus later denied that Grant had been considered and stated that they had not met. Alan Cumming and Rupert Everett were also considered for Lockhart. Cumming backed out over a salary dispute. Jason Issacs also auditioned for Lockhart, but was offered for the role of Lucius Malfoy instead, he was reluctant to take the role as he was already signed on to play Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (2003), but his family convinced him to take the role and accepted it. Before Coulson was cast as Tom Riddle, James McAvoy and Eddie Redmayne – who later played Newt Scamander in the &quot;Fantastic Beasts&quot; films – auditioned for the role.

==Production==
===Costume and set design===

Production designer Stuart Craig returned for the sequel to design new elements previously not seen in the first film. He designed the Burrow based on Arthur Weasley&#x27;s interest in Muggles, built vertically out of architectural salvage. Mr. Weasley&#x27;s flying car was created from a 1962 Ford Anglia 105E. The Chamber of Secrets, measuring over long and wide, was the biggest set created for the saga. Dumbledore&#x27;s office, which houses the Sorting Hat and the Sword of Gryffindor, was also built for the film.

Lindy Hemming was the costume designer for &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. She retained many of the characters&#x27; already established appearances, and chose to focus on the new characters introduced in the sequel. Gilderoy Lockhart&#x27;s wardrobe incorporated bright colours, in contrast with the &quot;dark, muted or sombre colours&quot; of the other characters. Branagh said, &quot;We wanted to create a hybrid between a period dandy and someone who looked as if they could fit into Hogwarts.&quot; Hemming also perfected Lucius Malfoy&#x27;s costume. One of the original concepts was for him to wear a pinstripe suit, but was changed to furs and a snake head cane in order to remark his aristocrat quality and to reflect a &quot;sense of the old.&quot;

===Filming===
Principal photography began on 19 November 2001, only three days after the wide release of the first film. Second-unit work had started three weeks before, primarily for the flying car scene. Filming took place mainly at Leavesden Film Studios in Hertfordshire, as well as on the Isle of Man. King&#x27;s Cross railway station was used as the filming location for Platform 9¾, though St Pancras railway station was used for the exterior shots. Gloucester Cathedral was used as the setting for Hogwarts School, along with Durham Cathedral, Alnwick Castle, Lacock Abbey, and the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. The Burrow was built in Gypsy Lane, Abbots Langley, in front of Leavesden Studios.

Roger Pratt was brought on as director of photography for &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, in order to give the film &quot;a darker and edgier feel&quot; than its predecessor, which reflected &quot;the growth of the characters and the story.&quot; Director Chris Columbus opted to use handheld cameras to allow more freedom in movement, which he considered &quot;a departure for [him] as a filmmaker.&quot; University of Cambridge linguistics professor Francis Nolan created Parseltongue, the language spoken by snakes in the film. Principal photography wrapped in July 2002.

===Sound design===
Due to the events that take place in &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, the film&#x27;s sound effects were much more expansive than in the previous instalment. Sound designer and supervising sound editor Randy Thom returned for the sequel using Pro Tools to complete the job, which included initial conceptions done at Skywalker Sound in California and primary work done at Shepperton Studios in England.

Thom wanted to give the Whomping Willow a voice, a deep growl for which he used his own voice slowed down, equalised and bass-boosted. For the mandrakes, he combined baby cries with female screams, in order to &quot;make it just exotic enough so that you think, &#x27;Hmm, I&#x27;ve never heard anything quite like &quot;that&quot; before.&#x27;&quot;

Thom described the basilisk as a challenge, &quot;because it&#x27;s a giant snake, but it&#x27;s also like a dragon — not many snakes have teeth like that. He had to hiss, he had to roar and there were times at the end when he was in pain.&quot; He mixed his own voice, tiger roars, and horse and elephant vocalizations.

===Special and visual effects===
Visual effects took nine months to make, until 9 October 2002, when the film was finished. Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Mill Film, the Moving Picture Company (MPC), Cinesite and Framestore CFC handled the approximately 950 visual effect shots in the film. Jim Mitchell and Nick Davis served as visual effects supervisors. They were in charge of creating the CGI characters Dobby the House Elf, the Basilisk, and the Cornish pixies, among others. Chas Jarrett from MPC served as CGI supervisor, overseeing the approach of any shot that contains CGI in the film. With a crew of 70 people, the company produced 251 shots, 244 of which made it to the film, from September 2001 to October 2002.

The visual effects team worked alongside creature effects supervisor Nick Dudman, who devised Fawkes the Phoenix, the Mandrakes, Aragog the Acromantula, and the first of the Basilisk. According to Dudman, Aragog was the most challenging character to create. The giant spider stood tall with an foot leg span, each of which had to be controlled by a different team member. The whole creature weighed three quarters of a ton. It took over 15 people to operate the animatronic Aragog on set.

The Whomping Willow sequence required a combination of practical and visual effects. Special effects supervisor John Richardson and his team created mechanically operated branches to hit the flying car. A 1:3 scale set was built on stage at Shepperton Studios, which featured the fully-sized top third of the tree with a forced perspective to appear a height of over high. The courtyard and the tree were built in 3D. Some shots ended up being entirely digital. Jarret identified the rendering as &quot;the biggest challenge&quot; of the scene, because &quot;there was just so much going on in [it] ... It was simply massive.&quot;

===Music===
John Williams, who composed the previous film&#x27;s score, returned to score &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;. Composing the film proved to be a difficult task, as Williams had just completed scoring &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot; and &quot;Minority Report&quot; when work was to begin on &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;. Because of this, William Ross was brought in to arrange themes from the &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; into the new material that Williams was composing whenever he had the chance. Ross also conducted the scoring sessions with the London Symphony Orchestra. The soundtrack album was released on 12 November 2002.

The film also continued the merchandising success set by its predecessor, with reports of shortages on Lego&#x27;s &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; tie-ins.

It was also No. 1 at the box office for two non-consecutive weekends. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was the second 2002 film to return to the number one spot, just after Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Signs&quot;. The film joined &quot;Die Another Day&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause 2&quot; to outperform the weak opening of &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;. Both &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; and &quot;Die Another Day&quot; were the most recent films to reclaim the number one spot for six months until June 2003 when &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; became the next film to do so. In the United Kingdom, the film broke all opening records that were previously held by &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. It made £18.9million during its opening including previews and £10.9million excluding previews.
 It went on to make £54.8million in the UK; at the time, the fifth-biggest tally of all time in the region.

Internationally, the film earned $59.5 million during its opening weekend. The film earned $3.7 million in Japan, making it the highest opening of any film in the country until it was surpassed a year later by &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;. In Malaysia, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; made a total of $474,000, breaking &quot;Eraser&quot;″s record for having the country&#x27;s biggest opening for any Warner Bros. film. It would go on to generate a total of $1.03 million in Singapore, becoming the second-highest film opening in the country, after &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;. Meanwhile, the film earned $3.1 million in Taiwan, surpassing &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; by 16%. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; would then gross over $1.15 million in the Philippines, ranking as an industry high in the country only 5% bigger than &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The film made a total of $879.8million worldwide in its original release and $926.2 million after re-releases. It was the second-highest-grossing film of 2002 worldwide behind &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, and the fourth highest-grossing film in the US and Canada that year with $262.6 million behind &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones&quot;. However, it was the year&#x27;s number one film outside of America, making $617.2million compared to &quot;The Two Towers&quot;″ $584.5million.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though perhaps more enchanting for younger audiences, &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; is nevertheless both darker and livelier than its predecessor, expanding and improving upon the first film&#x27;s universe.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot;, the only film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series to receive such grade.

Roger Ebert gave &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; 4 out of 4 stars, especially praising the set design. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commended the film for being better and darker than its predecessor: &quot;And among the things this &quot;Harry Potter&quot; does very well indeed is deepen the darker, more frightening atmosphere for audiences. This is as it should be: Harry&#x27;s story is supposed to get darker&quot;. Richard Roeper praised Columbus&#x27; direction and the film&#x27;s faithfulness to the book, saying: &quot;Chris Columbus, the director, does a real wonderful job of being faithful to the story but also taking it into a cinematic era&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; said the film was excessively long, but praised it for being darker and more dramatic, saying that its confidence and intermittent flair to give it a life of its own apart from the books was something &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; never achieved. &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the darker storyline, but said that the acting could have been better.

A. O. Scott from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;instead of feeling stirred you may feel battered and worn down, but not, in the end, too terribly disappointed&quot;. Peter Travers from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; condemned the film for being over-long and too faithful to the book: &quot;Once again, director Chris Columbus takes a hat-in-hand approach to Rowling that stifles creativity and allows the film to drag on for nearly three hours&quot;. Kenneth Turan from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film a cliché which is &quot;deja vu all over again, it&#x27;s likely that whatever you thought of the first production – pro or con – you&#x27;ll likely think of this one&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; was nominated for three BAFTA Awards: Best Production Design, Best Sound, and Best Special Visual Effects. The film was also nominated for six Saturn Awards. It received two nominations at the inaugural Visual Effects Society Awards. The Broadcast Film Critics Association granted it the Best Family Film and Best Composer awards, and nominated it for Best Digital Acting Performance (for Toby Jones).

<doc id="667369" wikidata="Q2430415" url="?curid=667369" title="Prime Minister of Turkey">
<text>The prime minister of Turkey, officially the prime minister of the Republic of Turkey (), was the head of government of the Republic of Turkey from 1920 to 2018, who led a political coalition in the Turkish Parliament and presided over the cabinet. Throughout the political history of Turkey, functions and powers of the post have changed occasionally. Prior to its dissolution as a result of the 2017 Constitutional Referendum, the holder of the premiership was generally the dominant figure in Turkish politics, outweighing the president.

==Premiership in the Ottoman Era==

In the Ottoman Empire, the prime minister of the Ottoman sultan held the title of Grand Vizier (), though in the 19th century, some heads of government were appointed with the title Prime Minister, (). Starting in the 1830s, Grand Viziers began to minister cabinets. After the Tanzimat period in the 19th century, the grand viziers came to assume a role more like that of the prime ministers of contemporary Western European monarchies. Later, with the Ottoman constitution of 1876, a parliament was established to oversee the grand vizier. With the constitutional amendments that took place during the Second Constitutional Era, the grand vizier was made answerable to the parliament rather than the sultan.

After the establishment of the Grand National Assembly in Ankara by the Turkish National Movement, the 1st Parliament instituted a new government called &quot;The Cabinet of the Executive Ministers&quot; (Turkish: &quot;İcra Vekilleri Heyeti).&quot; The post was then held by the Speaker of the Parliament, who presided over the cabinet &quot;ex-officio&quot;.

==Premiership in the Republic==
One-party period (1923–1945)

Following the declaration of the republic, the existing constitution of 1921 was amended, conferring the executive authority and the privilege to oversee governmental affairs to the prime minister, who was to be appointed by the president of the republic. 

Although the Presidency was established as a symbolic office with the president being unaccountable for his actions, Presidents Atatürk and İnönü had exercised executive authority as the leader of their party during the one-party period.

Multi-party period (1945–2018) 

Prior to the general election held in 1950, the constitution was amended, disallowing the president-elect to remain the leader of their political party. These amendments resulted in the prime minister becoming the dominant figure in Turkish politics, sharply diminishing the role of the president. 

After Prime Minister Adnan Menderes was ousted from power as a result of the 1960 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, the newly promulgated Constitution of 1961 reduced the powers of the government considerably, strengthening parliamentary supervision over the cabinet. These features of the constitution resulted in a fractured political system, causing many short-lived coalition governments to be formed until 1980. 

In the aftermath of the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, the Constitution of 1982 (still in use) was implemented. Even though the Constitution of 1982 was quite similar to its predecessor, there were new measures taken to avoid the formation of short-lived coalition governments. These measures included the introduction of 10% electoral threshold, unicameral parliamentary structure, and enforced executive powers. Along with broad executive powers being vested in the post of the prime minister, the realm of authority of the cabinet ministries (with the exclusion of the prime ministry) was drastically reduced, placing the ministers under the direct supervision of the prime minister. 

Later on, numerous amendments were made on the constitution, with the ones of paramount importance being the 2007, 2010, and 2017. Some of the changes approved by public vote were highly controversial. 

According to some, the direct election of the president for the first time in 2014 resulted in a de facto transition into a semi-presidential system, bringing an end to the prime minister&#x27;s dominant authority in Turkish politics.

Following the general elections in 2018, constitutional amendments approved in the 2017 referendum officially took effect, marking the end of 98 years of parliamentary governance in Turkey.

<doc id="667371" wikidata="Q102448" url="?curid=667371" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">
<text>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is a 2004 fantasy film directed by Alfonso Cuarón from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. It is based on the 1999 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002) and the third instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry&#x27;s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. It chronicles Harry&#x27;s third year at Hogwarts and his quest to uncover the truth about his past, including the connection recently-escaped Azkaban prisoner Sirius Black has to Harry and his deceased parents.

With this film, the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series switched to a longer eighteen-month production cycle. Cuarón was selected as director from a list that included Callie Khouri and Kenneth Branagh. The cast of previous instalments returned for the film, with the additions of Gary Oldman, David Thewlis, Timothy Spall, and Emma Thompson, among others. It was the first appearance of Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore, due to Richard Harris&#x27;s death in 2002. Principal photography began in February 2003 at Leavesden Film Studios. It was the first in the series to extensively use real-life locations, with sets built in Scotland and scenes shot in London. Filming wrapped in November 2003.

The film was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom, and on 4 June 2004 in North America. It was the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film to use IMAX Technology and released into IMAX theatres. &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; grossed a total of $808 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2004, behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. Critics praised Cuarón&#x27;s direction and the lead actors&#x27; performances. It is credited for marking a notable shift in the franchise&#x27;s tone and directing style and is often regarded by critics and fans alike as the best &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film. It was nominated for two Academy Awards, Best Original Music Score and Best Visual Effects, at the 77th Academy Awards in 2004. It was followed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; in 2005.

==Plot==
Harry Potter spends another dissatisfying summer with the Dursleys. On his thirteenth birthday, Vernon&#x27;s visiting sister Marge viciously insults Harry and his parents, and an angry Harry accidentally causes her to inflate and float away. Expecting to be expelled for using magic outside school, Harry flees.

The Knight Bus, an emergency transport for stranded witches and wizards, takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge assures Harry that he will not face punishment. Upon reuniting with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban and plans to kill him. While journeying to Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express is boarded by Dementors, ghostly prison guards searching for Black. One enters Harry&#x27;s compartment, causing him to faint, but the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, uses a Patronus Charm to repel it. At Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore announces that Dementors will patrol the school until Black is captured. Rubeus Hagrid is appointed as the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, but his first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy provokes a Hippogriff named Buckbeak to attack him; as a result, Draco&#x27;s father, Lucius, has Buckbeak sentenced to death.

Returning to Gryffindor Tower, the students find the Fat Lady&#x27;s portrait has been attacked, and the terrified Fat Lady warns Dumbledore that Black entered the castle. Hogwarts is put into lockdown until Dumbledore deems the area safe. During a stormy Quidditch match, Dementors cause Harry to fall off his broomstick, which is destroyed by the Whomping Willow. Dumbledore uses the Slowing Charm to break Harry&#x27;s fall, who later wakes up in the infirmary.

Harry, after leaving the infirmary, is caught trying to visit Hogsmeade by Fred and George, who give him the Marauder&#x27;s Map. Using the map, Harry sneaks into Hogsmeade. He follows Professor Minerva McGonagall, Madam Rosmerta, and Minister Fudge and learns that Black is actually his godfather but divulged the Potters&#x27; whereabouts to Voldemort and murdered their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew. The map is later discovered in Harry&#x27;s possession by Lupin, who confiscates it.

Determined to ward off the Dementors, Harry convinces Lupin to teach him the Patronus Charm. Watching Buckbeak&#x27;s execution, Ron is dragged by a large black dog into a hole at the base of the Whomping Willow. This leads the trio through an underground passage into the Shrieking Shack, where the dog is revealed to be Black, an Animagus who can transform into an animal.

Lupin appears, embracing Black as an old friend before revealing himself to be a werewolf. Snape arrives to apprehend Black but is knocked out by Harry&#x27;s spell. Lupin and Black reveal that Ron&#x27;s familiar, a rat named Scabbers, is actually the Animagus form of Pettigrew. Having betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents, he faked his death and framed Black for his own crimes. Turning Pettigrew back into human form, the group heads back to the castle, intending to both expose Pettigrew as the true criminal and exonerate Sirius, but the full moon causes Lupin to transform into a werewolf and Pettigrew escapes. Black transforms into his animal form and fights off werewolf Lupin, who seriously injures Black. Black manages to escape when a distant wolf cry distracts Lupin and sends him off. Harry finds Black, who are then both attacked by Dementors until an unseen figure casts a powerful Patronus charm to ward them off. Harry falls unconscious, awakening in the infirmary with Dumbledore and Hermione.

After learning that Black is sentenced to the Dementor&#x27;s Kiss, Harry and Hermione use Hermione&#x27;s Time-Turner to go back three hours. They witness their earlier actions and save Buckbeak from execution. When Dementors attack past Harry and Black, Harry realizes he was the one who saved himself and Black with a Patronus charm, and uses it to drive the Dementors away. They successfully free Black, who escapes on Buckbeak. Returning to the infirmary, they find Lupin, exposed as a werewolf, resigning and giving Harry back the Marauder&#x27;s Map. Black gifts Harry a Firebolt broomstick, which he joyfully rides.

==Cast==
* Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter: A 13-year-old British wizard famous for surviving his parents&#x27; murder at the hands of the evil dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant, who now enters his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
* Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley: Harry&#x27;s best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.
* Emma Watson as Hermione Granger: Harry&#x27;s other best friend and the trio&#x27;s brains.
* Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid: The gamekeeper and new Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts.
* Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore:The headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of all time. Gambon assumed the role after Richard Harris, who played Dumbledore in the previous two films, died of Hodgkin&#x27;s disease on 25 October 2002, three weeks before the second film&#x27;s release. Despite his illness, Harris was determined to film his part, telling a visiting David Heyman not to recast the role. Four months after Harris&#x27;s death, Cuarón chose Gambon as his replacement. Gambon was unconcerned with bettering or copying Harris, giving his own interpretation instead, but putting on a slight Irish accent for the role as an homage to him. He completed his scenes in three weeks. The producers originally offered the role to Ian McKellen, but McKellen turned it down as he had played a similar character Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. He also stated it would have been inappropriate to take Harris&#x27; role, as Harris had previously called McKellen a &quot;dreadful&quot; actor. Christopher Lee was also considered, he would later said that it would a very &quot;bad taste&quot; if he was offered the role. Harris&#x27; family had expressed an interest in seeing Harris&#x27;s close friend Peter O&#x27;Toole being chosen as his replacement, but the producers felt that his age and health would become troublesome down the line. According to Columbus, O&#x27;Toole turned down the role due to his close friend relationship with Harris and didn&#x27;t feel right to step into his shoes.
* Richard Griffiths as Vernon Dursley: Harry&#x27;s Muggle uncle.
* Gary Oldman as Sirius Black:Harry&#x27;s infamous godfather, who escapes from the Wizarding prison Azkaban after serving twelve years there for being wrongly accused of being the Death Eater who betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents to Voldemort. Oldman accepted the part because he needed the money, as he had not taken on any major work in several years after deciding to spend more time with his children. He was &quot;surprised by how difficult it was to pull off&quot;, comparing the role to Shakespearean dialogue. 
* Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: The Potions teacher at Hogwarts and head of Slytherin.
* Fiona Shaw as Petunia Dursley: Harry&#x27;s Muggle aunt.
* Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall: Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, the Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts and head of Gryffindor.
* Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew: A former friend of Harry&#x27;s parents said to have been killed by Sirius Black, but was later revealed to have been the real Death Eater who betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents to Voldemort.
* David Thewlis as Remus Lupin:The new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts and a werewolf. Robin Williams was interested in the role, but was turned down due to a &quot;British only&quot; cast rule. Thewlis, who had previously auditioned for the role of Quirinus Quirrell in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001), was Cuarón&#x27;s first choice for the role of Professor Lupin. He accepted the role on advice from Ian Hart, who was cast as Quirrell, and had told him that Professor Lupin was &quot;the best part in the book.&quot; Thewlis had seen the first two films and had only read part of the first book, although he read the third after taking the role.
* Emma Thompson as Sybill Trelawney: The Divination teacher at Hogwarts. Tilda Swinton was offered the role, but turned it down.
* Julie Walters as Molly Weasley: Ron&#x27;s mother.

Several actors from the previous film reprise their roles in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Harry Melling appears as Dudley Dursley, Harry&#x27;s Muggle cousin. James and Oliver Phelps play Fred and George Weasley, Ron&#x27;s twin brothers; Chris Rankin appears as Percy Weasley, Ron&#x27;s other brother and a Hogwarts head boy; and Bonnie Wright portrays their sister Ginny, while Mark Williams plays their father, Arthur Weasley. Tom Felton portrays Draco Malfoy, Harry&#x27;s rival in Slytherin, while Jamie Waylett and Josh Herdman appear as Crabbe and Goyle, Draco&#x27;s minions. Matthew Lewis and Devon Murray play Neville Longbottom and Seamus Finnigan respectively, two Gryffindor students in Harry&#x27;s year. David Bradley appears as Argus Filch, Hogwarts&#x27; caretaker, while Robert Hardy portrays Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic.

Pam Ferris portrays Aunt Marge, Vernon&#x27;s sister; Lee Ingleby plays Stan Shunpike, conductor of the Knight Bus; and Jim Tavaré appears as Tom, innkeeper of The Leaky Cauldron, replacing Derek Deadman from the first film. Dawn French plays the Fat Lady, a painting at Hogwarts, replacing Elizabeth Spriggs from the first film. Julie Christie appears as Madam Rosmerta, the barmaid at the Three Broomsticks. Warwick Davis appears as the conductor of the Hogwarts choir. The role was offered to him by producer David Heyman due to Filius Flitwick, Davis&#x27; original role, being absent from the script. The change in appearance for the new character later became Flitwick&#x27;s look for the rest of the series.

==Production==
===Development===
With the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, production of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was &quot;to give each [film] the time it required.&quot; Chris Columbus, the director of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he wanted to spend more time with his children. Even so, Columbus remained on as a producer alongside Heyman, as Columbus felt that such capacity offered him a better work-life balance, allowing him to not be present on the set all the time and spend time with his children. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but had envisioned a more Dickensian version of the stories, and was put off by the first two films which he found too &quot;bright and happy and full of light&quot;. Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; (2004) and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, &quot;The Village&quot; (2004). Warner Bros. then composed a three-name shortlist for Columbus&#x27;s replacement, which consisted of Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón in July 2002. Cuarón was initially reluctant to direct, as he had not read any of the books or seen the films. Del Toro berated him for his arrogance and told him to read the books. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story.

Cuarón&#x27;s appointment pleased J. K. Rowling, who loved his film &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; (2001) and was impressed with his adaptation of &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (1995). Heyman found that &quot;tonally and stylistically, [Cuarón] was the perfect fit.&quot; As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character&#x27;s emotional experience. Cuarón recalls, &quot;Emma&#x27;s essay was 10 pages long. Daniel&#x27;s was exactly two. Rupert didn&#x27;t deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn&#x27;t do it, he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m Ron; Ron wouldn&#x27;t do it.&#x27; So I said, &#x27;Okay, you do understand your character.&#x27; That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were going to hold on to for the rest of the process.&quot;

===Costume and set design===

Cuarón wanted to establish a more mature tone in the characters&#x27; costumes and the sets. He explained, &quot;What I really wanted to do was to make Hogwarts more contemporary and a little more naturalistic.&quot; He studied English schools and noted, &quot;Each teenager&#x27;s individuality was reflected in the way they wore their uniform. So I asked all the kids in the film to wear their uniforms as they would if their parents weren&#x27;t around.&quot; Columbus considered the costumes changes as &quot;a reflection of the character development within the books themselves&quot; and their transition to teenagers. Whereas in the first two films the characters are constantly in their uniforms, in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; the characters often wear modern street clothes. Rowling, who was consulted for this change, stated, &quot;for me the cloaks and everything makes sense for the academic time but in personal time they would be wearing their own clothes.&quot; Jany Temime joined the film as costume designer, eventually working on all of the following instalments in the series.

For Remus Lupin, Temime opted for &quot;tweeds typical of England.&quot; Cuarón stated that the character should look like &quot;an uncle who parties hard on the weekends&quot;, so Temime preserved his gown &quot;unkempt and more shabby than the other teachers’ robes.&quot; For Trelawney, Thompson made sketches of the costumes and sent them to Temime and Cuarón. Thompson saw the character as &quot;a person who hasn&#x27;t looked in the mirror for a long time&quot;. In order to highlight the character&#x27;s short-sightedness, Temime used material filled with mirrors and eyes, as well as oversized glasses with magnifying lenses. Cuarón wanted Dumbledore to look like &quot;an old hippie, but still very chic and with a lot of class&quot;. Temime used tie-dyed silk that would float behind him while walking, which she considered &quot;a much lighter look&quot; that gave the character more energy, in contrast with the &quot;heavy and majestic&quot; costumes designed for Harris&#x27; portrayal of Dumbledore.
Cuarón&#x27;s main concern was for Hogwarts to have a larger scope and be grounded in the real world. The scale model of the Hogwarts exterior designed for the first film was expanded by around 40% for &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. Production designer Stuart Craig and art director Gary Tomkins added constructions including a clock tower and a courtyard, and the hospital wing was redesigned and rebuilt. Other sets constructed for the film included the Hogsmeade village and The Three Broomsticks public house.

The use of real-life locations significantly changed the look of Hagrid&#x27;s hut. For &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, the landscape around the set changed from being completely flat to the side of a hill. The hut doubled in size, with a separate bedroom built on the back and the addition of a large pumpkin patch and a chimney. Craig cited the Shrieking Shack as a particularly challenging set to create. It was built on a large hydraulic platform with the help of the special effects department, &quot;creaking and moving as if being continually buffeted by the wind&quot; in order to appear almost alive.

Some sets were either reused from earlier films or used for more than one space. The Defence Against the Dark Arts and Divination classrooms were filmed in the same set. The Honeydukes set was a redress of the set of Flourish &amp; Blotts that was seen in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, which, in turn, had been redressed from the Ollivanders set from the first film.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on 24 February 2003, at Leavesden Film Studios, and ended on 28 November 2003.

The third film was the first to extensively use real-life locations, as much of the first two films had been shot in the studio. Three sets for the film were built in Glen Coe, Scotland, near the Clachaig Inn. Harry&#x27;s ride on Buckbeak over Hogwarts&#x27; Lake was filmed at the Virginia Water Lake in Surrey. The Black Lake was also filmed from Loch Shiel, Loch Eilt and Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands. Incidentally, the Glenfinnan Viaduct railway, which was also featured in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, is opposite Loch Shiel and was used to film the sequences when the Dementor boarded the train. A small section of the Knight Bus scene, where it weaves in between traffic, was filmed in North London&#x27;s Palmers Green on 2 April 2003. Some parts were also filmed in and around Borough Market and Lambeth Bridge in London. Certain scenes were also filmed at the University of Oxford; those set in the hospital wing were filmed at the university&#x27;s Divinity School. 

Director of photography Michael Seresin considered the story much darker compared to its two predecessors, so he employed &quot;moody [lighting], with more shadows&quot;. He used a variety of wide-angle lenses to amplify Hogwarts prominence in the story, and only used close-ups sparingly. &quot;We prefer to observe the kids from further away, as I find body language to be very interesting&quot;, Cuarón explained.

Rowling allowed Cuarón to make minor changes to the book, on the condition that he stuck to the book&#x27;s spirit. She allowed him to place a sundial on Hogwarts&#x27; grounds, but rejected a graveyard, as that would play an important part in the then-unreleased sixth book. Rowling said she &quot;got goosebumps&quot; when she saw several moments in the film, as they inadvertently referred to events in the final two books, she stated, &quot;people are going to look back on the film and think that those were put in deliberately as clues.&quot; When filming concluded, Cuarón found that it had &quot;been the two sweetest years of my life,&quot; and expressed his interest in directing one of the sequels.

The Knight Bus sequence was shot over several weeks at various locations in London. In order to give the impression of the vehicle moving at , stunt coordinator Greg Powell explained, &quot;We drove the bus at about and the other cars were going only about . It took weeks of planning with stunt drivers, and even the people you see on the street are stunt men and women, who were trained to walk incredibly slow just to make the bus look faster.&quot;

===Special and visual effects===

Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) and Framestore handled the key visual effects shots for the film, while The Moving Picture Company, Cinesite, and Double Negative crafted additional VFX material.

Cuarón originally wanted to move away from CGI toward puppetry. He hired master puppeteer Basil Twist and experimented with underwater puppets to figure out the movements of dementors. The tests were shot in slow motion, but ultimately the method wasn&#x27;t practical. The water test footage provided creative direction for the visual effects team, adding the intangible metaphysical quality Cuarón was seeking. Visual effects supervisors Tim Burke and Roger Guyett, the Industrial Light &amp; Magic VFX team, and Temime collaborated in the creation of dementors.
Cuarón commented on the difficulty of creating Buckbeak, which took months of research and preparation, beginning with the creature&#x27;s skeletal design. Cuarón said, &quot;Once we worked out the physiology, the way his bones would actually move, we had to capture his personality, which is a mixture of regal elegance, particularly when he is flying, and the clumsy and greedy creature he becomes back on land.&quot; Creature effects supervisor Nick Dudman created several practical hippogriffs for the production, while Burke and Guyett oversaw the creation of the computer-generated version. Guyett cited the complex movement of the feathers as an achievement that had &quot;never been done before.&quot;

The inflation of Aunt Marge was achieved practically. Ferris said, &quot;I wore various prosthetic bodies, which inflated at different rates, and at my largest I was about four and a half feet wide.&quot; The costume prevented Ferris from walking and eating. Thirty-eight tweed suits of increasing size were used for the sequence.

Cinesite was in charge of the time travel shot featured in the film, which was over a minute long. The main action was filmed on a steadicam against bluescreen, and four minutes of background footage was shot separately. The background was then sped up and composited behind the main action. Two other plates of background footage were tiled together as the camera turned.

===Music===
When it was announced that Cuarón would direct &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, there was initial speculation that his collaborative composer Patrick Doyle (who would score the following film) would do the music. Cuarón, however, retained John Williams, for whom it would be the third and final movie he scored in the series. The soundtrack was a significant departure from the previous two, as Cuarón wanted the score to take a different approach. One of the new themes, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, was written during production for a children&#x27;s choir to perform in Hogwarts&#x27;s Great Hall in one of the film&#x27;s earlier scenes. The lyrics of the song were taken from William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The soundtrack album was released by Atlantic Records on 25 May 2004.

==Differences from the book==

&quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was, at the time of publication, the series&#x27; longest book. The increasing plot complexity necessitated a looser adaptation of the book&#x27;s finer plot lines and back-story. The connection between Harry&#x27;s father and the Marauder&#x27;s Map is only briefly mentioned, as is Remus Lupin&#x27;s association to the map. Additionally, it was never mentioned who the Marauders were or who the nicknames Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs referred to. Some exposition was removed for dramatic effect: both the Shrieking Shack and Scabbers the rat are mentioned only very briefly in the film, while they receive more thorough coverage in the novel. Most of Sirius Black&#x27;s back story is also cut, with no mention of how he escaped from Azkaban.

On account of pace and time considerations, the film glosses over detailed descriptions of magical education. Only one Hippogriff, Buckbeak, is seen, and only Draco Malfoy and Harry are seen interacting with the Hippogriff during Care of Magical Creatures lessons. Most other lessons, including all of Snape&#x27;s Potions classes, were cut from the film. The Fidelius Charm&#x27;s complicated description is removed entirely from the film, with no explanation given of exactly how Sirius is supposed to have betrayed the Potters to Lord Voldemort. Many of this scene&#x27;s lines are redistributed amongst Cornelius Fudge and Minerva McGonagall; in compensation, McGonagall&#x27;s exposition of the Animagus transformation is instead given by Snape.

The romantic connection between Ron and Hermione is more prominent in the film than the book; in response to criticism of the first two films for sacrificing character development for mystery and adventure, the emotional development of all three lead characters is given more attention in the third film. However, any mention of Harry&#x27;s crush on Cho Chang is removed, and she first appears in the fourth film. &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; also shows a darker tone and more of Harry&#x27;s emotions. For instance, after learning of Black&#x27;s &quot;betrayal&quot; of Harry&#x27;s parents, he shouts in anger &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kill him&quot;, whereas in the book he is &quot;too stunned to move&quot;.

In the book, Gryffindor wins the Quidditch Cup for the first time in the series, a rather significant character-development subplot that is almost completely omitted from the film. Only the first Quidditch match of the school year (where Harry&#x27;s Nimbus 2000 broomstick is destroyed) is part of the film&#x27;s narrative, and there are no other mentions of the sport or the Gryffindor team&#x27;s successful campaign for the Cup during the rest of the film. The final scene before the credits shows Harry on his new broomstick, the Firebolt, as a known gift from Sirius after his aided escape from captivity, whereas in the book, the new broomstick is an anonymous gift midyear from Sirius (unbeknownst to Harry or anyone else at the time) that is examined by the Hogwarts staff for safety and security reasons before it eventually is given to Harry for use in pursuit of the Cup championship.

==Distribution==
===Marketing===
As with the series&#x27; previous instalments, &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was a large merchandising opportunity. The video game version, designed by EA UK, was released on 25 May 2004. Mattel released film tie-ins that included the &quot;Harry Potter Championship Quidditch&quot; board game and character action figures. Lego also expanded on its previous merchandising for the first two films with the release of sets that included the Knight Bus, Shrieking Shack and a new Hogwarts castle.

===Home media===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; was released on DVD and on VHS on 23 November 2004. The 2-disc Special Editions later came out on DVD and Blu-ray on 4 October 2016. The film was also released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on 7 November 2017.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; held its New York premiere at Radio City Music Hall on 23 May 2004, followed by its London premiere at Leicester Square on 30 May 2004. The film then opened in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2004, and on 4 June 2004 in the United States. It was the first film in the series to be released in both conventional and IMAX theatres. Upon release, the film broke the record for a biggest single day in the United Kingdom&#x27;s box office history making £5.3million on a Monday. It went on to break records both with and without previews, making £23.9 million including previews and £9.3 million excluding them. &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; had the highest-opening weekend at the UK&#x27;s box office, until &quot;Spectre&quot; beat the record in 2015. It went on to make a total of £45.6million in the UK. The film made $93.7million during its opening weekend in the United States and Canada playing on 8,900 screens at 3,855 theaters, achieving, at the time, the third-biggest-opening weekend of all time. This opening also broke &quot;Hulk&quot; record ($62.1million) for the highest-opening weekend for a film released in June. &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; held this record for five years until &quot;&quot; topped it in 2009 with $109million. Additionally, it surpassed &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; for having the largest opening weekend for a Warner Bros. film. The film was also No. 1 at the North American box office for two consecutive weekends.

&quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; made a total of $808.5million worldwide, which made it 2004&#x27;s second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;. In the U.S. and Canada, it was only the year&#x27;s sixth-highest-grossing film, making $250.1million. However, it was the year&#x27;s number one film internationally, making $558.3million compared to &quot;Shrek 2&quot; $487.5million. Despite its successful box office run, &quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; is the lowest-grossing &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, and the third lowest-grossing film of the Wizarding World series.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 260 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Under the assured direction of Alfonso Cuarón, &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; triumphantly strikes a delicate balance between technical wizardry and complex storytelling.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; lauded the film&#x27;s more mature tone and said it was &quot;darker, more complex, rooted in character.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called the film &quot;a deeper, darker, visually arresting and more emotionally satisfying adaptation of the J.K. Rowling literary phenomenon,&quot; especially compared to the first two instalments. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars: &quot;Not only is this dazzler by far the best and most thrilling of the three Harry Potter movies to date, it&#x27;s a film that can stand on its own even if you never heard of author J.K. Rowling and her young wizard hero.&quot; Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;Salon&quot; considered it &quot;one of the greatest fantasy films of all time.&quot; Nicole Arthur of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film as &quot;complex, frightening, [and] nuanced.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that the film was not quite as good as the first two, but still called it &quot;delightful, amusing and sophisticated&quot;. He praised the cast, but felt the need for a better plot. Claudia Puig from &quot;USA Today&quot; found the film to be &quot;a visual delight,&quot; and added that &quot;Cuarón is not afraid to make a darker film and tackle painful emotions&quot;; while Richard Roeper called the film &quot;a creative triumph.&quot; Sean Smith from &quot;Newsweek&quot; said: &quot;&quot;The Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; boasts a brand-new director and a bold new vision,&quot; and called the film &quot;moving,&quot; praising the performances by the three main leads. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the film for being more mature than its predecessors.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 5, saying, &quot;This new Harry Potter picture will cast a spell on its fanbase. But the broomstick&#x27;s losing altitude.&quot; &quot;Screen Daily&quot; commented, &quot;Cuaron delivers a genuinely spooky and emotionally involving adventure which gives the world of &quot;Potter&quot; much-needed character and atmosphere&quot;. The BBC commended the sets and direction, but did not find it &quot;emotionally engrossing&quot;. Hollywood.com gave a positive review, praising the plot and storyline, despite a deviation from the first two films.

===Accolades===
&quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; received two Academy Award nominations: Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score for John Williams. The film was also nominated for four BAFTA Awards: Best British Film, Best Production Design, Best Makeup &amp; Hair, and Best Visual Effects, and won public-voted Orange Film of the Year award. It received nine Saturn Awards nominations. It won two Visual Effects Society Awards and was nominated for three others. The Broadcast Film Critics Association nominated it for Best Family Film, Best Young Actor (for Daniel Radcliffe), and Best Young Actress (for Emma Watson).

The film ranks at 471 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. IGN designated &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; as the fifth best fantasy film. Additionally, Moviefone designated the film as the tenth best of the decade. In 2011, the film was voted Film of the Decade at the First Light Awards by children aged 5–15. The American Film Institute nominated it for the 2007 revision of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies, and for AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 in the fantasy genre.

It is based on the 2000 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004) and the fourth instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. The film stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry&#x27;s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry&#x27;s fourth year at Hogwarts as he is chosen by the Goblet of Fire to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.

Principal photography began in early 2004, and the film premiered worldwide on 18 November 2005. Five days following release, it had earned over US$102 million at the North American box office, the third-highest first-weekend tally for a &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot;. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; enjoyed a successful run at the box office, grossing $896 million worldwide, the highest-grossing film of 2005 and the sixth-highest-grossing film in the series.

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; was the second film in the series to be released in IMAX. The film received positive reviews. It was followed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; in 2007.

==Plot==

Harry Potter has a nightmare in which a Muggle caretaker named Frank Bryce is murdered at the Riddle House after overhearing a plot by Lord Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew and another man whom Harry does not recognise. The following morning, Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys, Hermione Granger, Cedric Diggory and his father Amos. That night, Death Eaters attack the campsite after the tournament and the unknown man from Harry&#x27;s nightmare casts the Dark Mark.

At Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament along with the Durmstrang Institute and the Beauxbatons Academy. One student from each school will be chosen by the Goblet of Fire to participate; students under the age of seventeen are ineligible. The Goblet selects Fleur Delacour for Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum for Durmstrang, and Cedric for Hogwarts. It then chooses Harry as a fourth Champion, leading to much confusion. Many students believe Harry cheated, and Ron distances himself from him, hurt that Harry did not tell him when he allegedly entered. Harry is forced to compete due to a magical binding contract when a Champion&#x27;s name was selected.

For the first task, the Champions must retrieve an egg by getting past a dragon. Professor Alastor Moody, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, hints that Harry can use his wand to summon his broomstick. All four Champions collect their eggs. Ron reconciles with Harry after witnessing how perilous the first task was. On Christmas Eve, the school hosts the Yule Ball, but Harry and Ron could not attend with their preferred dates and instead go with Parvati and Padma Patil, respectively; Hermione goes with Viktor, provoking Ron&#x27;s jealousy. Cedric advises Harry to use the Prefects&#x27; bathroom on the fifth floor of Hogwarts, take a bath, and submerge the egg in the water to find the second clue.

For the second task, the Champions must rescue somebody of value to them from the Black Lake: Harry has to save Ron, Cedric has to save his girlfriend Cho Chang (whom Harry asked to the Ball), Viktor has to rescue Hermione, and Fleur has to save her sister Gabrielle. Neville Longbottom gives Harry gillyweed to help him breathe underwater. Cedric comes in first, and Harry is awarded second place after he saves not only Ron but also Gabrielle after Fleur had withdrawn from the task.

Harry later finds the lifeless body of Barty Crouch Sr., a Ministry of Magic official, in the Forbidden Forest. In Dumbledore&#x27;s office, he enters a Pensieve. He witnesses the questioning of Igor Karkaroff, current headmaster of Durmstrang, by Barty Crouch Sr. Karkaroff is asked to name those who served Voldemort. He names Severus Snape, but Dumbledore vouches for Snape. Karkaroff then names Barty Crouch Jr.. Harry recognises Crouch Jr. from his nightmare.

For the third task, the Champions must navigate a maze to reach the Triwizard Cup. Harry and Cedric reach the Cup only to discover it is a Portkey that transports them to a graveyard from Harry&#x27;s dream. Pettigrew kills Cedric on Voldemort&#x27;s orders. He then uses Harry&#x27;s blood to resurrect Voldemort, who summons his Death Eaters before torturing Harry. Voldemort attempts to use the Killing Curse on Harry but the latter deflects it. The ghosts of Voldemort&#x27;s previous victims, including Harry&#x27;s parents, appear, distracting Voldemort long enough for Harry to use the Cup to return to Hogwarts with Cedric&#x27;s body.

Harry informs Dumbledore of Cedric&#x27;s murder and Voldemort&#x27;s return. Harry is escorted by Moody to his office where he learns that Moody put his name into the Goblet and was guiding him to ensure the return of Voldemort. Just as Moody is about to kill Harry, Dumbledore, Snape and Minerva McGonagall subdue Moody. Using Veritaserum, they learn that they have caught Barty Crouch Jr. who was impersonating Moody using Polyjuice Potion; the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk.

At the end-of-term feast, Dumbledore announces that Voldemort murdered Cedric, although the Ministry denies these claims. Harry informs Dumbledore of his encounter with Voldemort, which Dumbledore describes as Priori Incantatem. The three schools bid farewell, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione agreeing that everything will change.

==Cast==

* Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter: A 14-year-old British wizard famous for surviving his parents&#x27; murder at the hands of the evil dark wizard Lord Voldemort as an infant, who now enters his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
* Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley: Harry&#x27;s best friend at Hogwarts and a younger member of the Weasley wizarding family.
* Emma Watson as Hermione Granger: Harry&#x27;s other best friend and the trio&#x27;s brains.
* Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid: The gamekeeper and Care of Magical Creatures teacher at Hogwarts.
* Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort:A dark wizard intent on conquering the Wizarding World and the leader of the Death Eaters. Despite being aware of the success of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books and films, Fiennes hadn&#x27;t originally read or seen them, so he wasn&#x27;t interested at first when approached to play Voldemort, but after telling his sister Martha, she convinced him to take the role. Fiennes commented on the difficulty of playing someone who is &quot;the essence of evil,&quot; and discussed giving a humanity to Voldemort in order for him to be &quot;deeply, truly evil&quot;, citing the character&#x27;s unhappy childhood as fuel for &quot;anger, jealousy and hatred&quot;. He and director Mike Newell were interested in exploring the character&#x27;s &quot;unexpected mood swings&quot;. Newell cited Fiennes&#x27; ability to play &quot;a realistic and frightening villain&quot; instead of &quot;a simple caricature&quot; as a reason for his casting.
* Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore:The headmaster of Hogwarts and one of the greatest wizards of all time. Gambon commented on the state of the character in the film: &quot;Dumbledore is no longer in control and he&#x27;s frightened.&quot; Newell compared Gambon&#x27;s performance with Richard Harris&#x27; iteration in earlier films, showing the character as &quot;fallible and not omnipotent&quot; and &quot;inadequate rather than super-adequate.&quot;
* Brendan Gleeson as Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody:A famous ex-Auror appointed by Dumbledore as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Gleeson referred to Moody as &quot;a gunslinger with a wand,&quot; whose &quot;great wounds have damaged him greatly.&quot; Heyman found Gleeson brought &quot;a great balance of ferociousness and humour&quot; to what he called a &quot;complex, challenging character.&quot; 
* Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy: Draco&#x27;s father and a former Hogwarts pupil of Slytherin House. He is also a member of the Death Eaters. Isaacs didn&#x27;t initially expect to be back in the fourth &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film, but felt nonetheless grateful to be able to &quot;get the wig out of mothballs&quot; while preparing for the next film, where he was slated to have a bigger role.
* Gary Oldman as Sirius Black: Harry&#x27;s godfather, who had escaped from Azkaban after being wrongly imprisoned for twelve years and is now a fugitive.
* Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: The Potions teacher at Hogwarts and head of Slytherin.
* Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall: Deputy Headmistress of Hogwarts, the Transfiguration teacher at Hogwarts and head of Gryffindor.
* Timothy Spall as Peter Pettigrew / Wormtail: The Death Eater who betrayed Harry&#x27;s parents to Voldemort.

==Production==
===Development===
Chris Columbus, who directed &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (2001) and &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; (2002), originally thought about returning to direct the film adaptation of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; while producing &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004), but ultimately declined because his children wanted to spend time with him like a family. In addition, they wanted to move back to the United States of America to see their friends after moving to England for the first two films. Having read the first three books, Columbus had noticed the progressively darker tone of the story, leading author J.K. Rowling to give him, producer David Heyman and screenwriter Steve Kloves copies of a huge manuscript about her plans for &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; before it was published, just so they could prepare themselves in terms of filming each subsequent film. M. Night Shyamalan was approached to direct the film but he was more interested in doing a film adaptation of &quot;Life of Pi&quot;. British film director Mike Newell was chosen to direct the film after &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; director Alfonso Cuarón announced that he would only be able to direct one &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film. In a statement explaining the transition of directors, series producer Heyman said:
Work on the script began in April 2003. Heyman considered the pre-production on &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; had been too lengthy for a single film. He stated, &quot;We&#x27;re going to shoot it as one and see how it ends up. If it&#x27;s too long then we&#x27;ll make it into two.&quot; Kloves, writer for the previous instalments, returned for &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. On adapting the 636-page book into a single feature-length film, Kloves commented, &quot;we always thought it would be two movies, but we could never figure out a way to break it in two. So it will be a different experience from the book.&quot; Columbus advised Heyman of splitting &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; into two separate films due to its length, but Warner Bros. showed no interest in the idea. Newell found that &quot;there was a way of making one film, which was as a thriller,&quot; while &quot;[staying] true to the book and [keeping] the length down.&quot; In order to prepare for the film, Newell watched &quot;paranoid thrillers&quot; such as &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974), and &quot;Three Days of the Condor&quot; (1975). Henry Cavill auditioned for Cedric Diggory before Pattinson was cast; and Tolga Safer, who appeared as Karkaroff&#x27;s Aide, auditioned for Viktor Krum before Ianevski was cast. Rosamund Pike was considered for Rita Skeeter, but she turned down the role because it was minor, she would later regret the decision.

===Costume and set design===

Costume designer Jany Temime returned as costume designer for &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;. Temime made the Beauxbatons uniforms out of french blue silk, which stood out from the muted colours of the other schools. The fabric of the uniforms &quot;clings to their form, in complete contrast to the restrictive uniforms the Hogwarts girls wear.&quot; The hat was designed by milliner Philip Treacy. The Durmstrang uniform was made of thick wool, with crimson robes and fur hats and capes. Temime drew inspiration from Habsburg and Russian folklore. For the Yule Ball, Temime created more than 300 costumes. Hermione&#x27;s dress, which took three months to make, was designed to be a &quot;fairy-tale dress&quot;, balancing &quot;sweetness and allure&quot; and keeping it &quot;very prudish&quot;, in order for it to be &quot;slightly sexy&quot; while still appropriate for a teenager. Moody&#x27;s coat was inspired by spaghetti westerns, with a team spending a week &quot;aging and distressing the coat to give it a lifetime&#x27;s worth of wear.&quot;

As in the previous instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan served as production designer and set decorator, respectively. Due to the film&#x27;s scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. As the novel described it as an ice palace, they decided to make &quot;the magic ceiling out of ice&quot;, covering the walls in reflective silver and giving &quot;an icy or silver makeover&quot; to the decorations. McMillan and fellow set decorator Lee Sandales also created &quot;magical ice sculptures, iced drinks and frosted food&quot;. Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it &quot;one of the biggest sets we&#x27;ve ever built for any of the films.&quot; For the second task, involving the film&#x27;s underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank measuring deep by square, holding &quot;about half a million gallons of water.&quot; It is the largest underwater filming tank in Europe. As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.

===Filming===

Principal photography officially began on 4 May 2004, although shooting with the main cast did not start until 25 June 2004 at Leavesden Studios in England, and wrapped in March 2005.

The local area surrounding Leavesden Studios was used for the site of the Quidditch World Cup, filmed in Ivinghoe Beacon, and Ashridge Wood, while the cliff where the characters land with the Portkey was located in Seven Sisters Country Park in Seaford, East Sussex. Kirby wires were used to suspend the actors in the air during the landing scene.

Parts of Hogwarts were filmed at Oxford University. Harry&#x27;s confrontation with Malfoy, who is later turned into a ferret by Moody, was shot in the courtyard quadrangle of the New College Cloister. Divinity School served as the room where McGonagall teaches Gryffindor students how to dance for the Yule Ball, having also been used as Hogwarts&#x27; infirmary in previous films. The Yule Ball scene was filmed in December 2004. Scenes by Hogwarts&#x27; Lake were filmed at the Virginia Water Lake in Surrey.

The forest where Hagrid shows Harry the dragons was set in Black Park, next to Pinewood Studios, while the first task of the Triwizard Tournament was filmed at the Steall Falls in Glen Nevis and Black Rock Gorge. For the second task, set in the Black Lake, the filmmakers tried a technique called dry for wet, where actors are suspended and wind is blown on them to simulate being underwater, but found &quot;the hair didn&#x27;t undulate convincingly.&quot; The sequence was then filmed in a large underwater tank, and the actors took scuba diving lessons in preparation, under the supervision of stunt coordinator Greg Powell. Radcliffe underwent six months of training for the scene and spent more than 40 hours underwater over the three weeks it took to film.

===Music===

John Williams, who had scored the first three &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, could not return for the fourth instalment due to a busy schedule. Patrick Doyle, who had worked with Newell on &quot;Into the West&quot; and &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot;, replaced him as composer. The initial request was that Doyle would be working with Williams&#x27; material, but eventually only &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;, the leitmotif of the series, remained from the previous scores. Pulp lead singer Jarvis Cocker, who was even reported to score the film, was one of the musicians invited by Doyle, with whom he had worked in the &quot;Great Expectations&quot; soundtrack, to write a song for a wizard rock band. Once Doyle chose Cocker&#x27;s composition, he and other British musicians such as Jonny Greenwood and Philip Selway of Radiohead were picked to play the fictional band, both performing songs for the soundtrack and having cameo roles in the film.

==Differences from the book==
With the &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; novel almost twice the length of &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;, the writers and producers reduced certain scenes and concepts to make the transition from page to screen. Director Mike Newell described the problem as one of &quot;compressing a huge book into the compass of a movie&quot;. This was achieved by &quot;putting aside&quot; all the components of the novel which did not directly relate to Harry and his journey.

&quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; is the first film adaptation not to begin at Privet Drive; after the opening sequence, Harry awakens at the Burrow on the morning of the Quidditch World Cup.

The gameplay at the Quidditch World Cup was removed for timing reasons, leaving an abrupt temporal jump that some reviewers considered awkward or &quot;rushed&quot;. In the book, Harry and many of the Weasleys support Ireland, while in the film Harry and Ron support Bulgaria. Nonetheless, both of them admire the Bulgarian seeker Viktor Krum. The scene where Dumbledore asks Harry if he put his name in the goblet is noticeably different. In the book, he asks calmly whereas in the film, he appears much more angry and frightened, to the point that he even manhandles Harry and demands an answer from him.

Much of the house elves/slavery subplot, which involves Hermione&#x27;s attempt to form a group (S.P.E.W.) to promote their welfare is omitted. The scene where Harry hears Karkaroff arguing with Snape at the Yule Ball is cut from the film, but was shot and can be seen on the DVD extras.

Other scenes are shortened and amalgamated to include only the most essential plot details. For example, the three Death Eater trials Harry witnesses in the Pensieve are merged into one sequence. The characters of Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, Cassius Warrington, Ludo Bagman, Winky, Narcissa Malfoy, and Bertha Jorkins are all absent, as well as Dobby, who was supposed to help Harry obtain Gillyweed for the second task. In place of Dobby, this scene was changed to involve Neville Longbottom. There is no train scene at the end where Rita Skeeter is revealed to be an illegal, unregistered Animagus or that Hermione uses this information to blackmail her into silence for a year. Harry is never seen either receiving or giving away the 1,000 galleons in prize winnings. All of Sirius Black&#x27;s lines are condensed into a single fireside conversation. The scene in which Crouch Jr. is taken back to Azkaban is different from the book, in which he was &quot;kissed&quot; by a Dementor summoned by Cornelius Fudge. There is also no conversation in which Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, leaving this to be explained in the next film.

Conversely, Harry&#x27;s first trial with a dragon is expanded into an extended flight around Hogwarts.

The world premiere took place in London, England on 6 November 2005. One of the features of the premiere was an animatronic, fire-breathing Hungarian Horntail.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;The main characters are maturing, and the filmmakers are likewise improving on their craft; vibrant special effects and assured performances add up to what is the most complex yet of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; praised the film for both its humour and its dark tone. The young actors were praised for demonstrating a &quot;greater range of subtle emotions&quot;, particularly Daniel Radcliffe whom &quot;Variety&quot; described as delivering a &quot;dimensional and nuanced performance&quot;.

Robert Pattinson received critical praise for his scenes as Cedric Diggory, where he &quot;invested him with a charm and everyman likeability, making his demise at the hands of the newly made-flesh Voldemort a devastatingly poignant turning point in the series.&quot; New cast members were also praised: Brendan Gleeson&#x27;s portrayal of Mad-Eye Moody was described as &quot;colourful&quot;; Miranda Richardson&#x27;s scenes as Rita Skeeter were described as &quot;wonderful&quot;; and Ralph Fiennes&#x27;s portrayal of Lord Voldemort was described as &quot;sublime villainy&quot;.

The maturity of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, among others, impressed most critics. While the major characters were portrayed as children in the previous films, &quot;they have subtly transitioned into teenagers (in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;)&quot; according to one &quot;USA Today&quot; reviewer. Desson Thomson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film &quot;Probably the most engaging film of the Potter series thus far&quot;. Joe Morgenstern of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; stated &quot;The studio, like plucky Harry, passes with flying colors. The new one, directed by Mike Newell from another astute script by Mr. Kloves, is even richer and fuller, as well as dramatically darker. It&#x27;s downright scary how good this movie is&quot;.

Negative criticism included the film&#x27;s pace which &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; described as being &quot;far too episodic&quot;, while CNN.com described the film as &quot;clunky and disjointed&quot;. Another criticism was that the many supporting characters did not get enough screen time. The film was listed at #36 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot; praising Rowling for ingeniously blending &quot;two literary traditions, fantasy and coming-through-school fiction&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction at the 78th Academy Awards. At the 2006 Teen Choice Awards, the film won the award for Choice Movie Drama. The film won the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design, making it the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film to win at the BAFTAs.

At the 2006 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, the film won the Blimp Award for Favorite Movie, becoming the only &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film to do so.

==Lawsuit==
In the run up to the film, Warner Bros. approached a Canadian folk group called the Wyrd Sisters to obtain permission to use the name &quot;The Weird Sisters&quot; for its &quot;Harry Potter&quot; band. When a deal could not be made, the Canadian band filed a US$40-million lawsuit against Warner Bros., the North American distributor of the film, as well as the members of the in-movie band (members of Radiohead and Pulp, among others) for the misuse of their group&#x27;s name. (In a deleted scene, they are simply introduced as &quot;the band that needs no introduction&quot;.) The Canadian band also brought an injunction to stop the release of the film in its country as it contained a performance by the identically named fictional rock band. An Ontario judge dismissed this motion, and to avoid further controversy Warner Bros. rendered the band unnamed in the film and many derived products. However, the Winnipeg-based group continued to pursue the lawsuit; lead singer Kim Baryluk stated in her claim that &quot;consumers will assume that the smaller and less famous Canadian band is trying to take advantage of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fame by copying the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; band&#x27;s name when in fact the reverse is true.&quot; The injunction was dismissed, and the band was ordered to pay costs. , the lawsuit has been settled, the details sealed.

She has published six novels between 2010 and 2024, and has also written short stories.

In October 2016, Lazlo announced the release of her new single &quot;Promised Land&quot;. In February 2017, she released her new single &quot;Lola &amp; Jim&quot; followed by new studio album &quot;Woman&quot; in October 2017.

<text>Samuel James Tilden Sheckard (November 23, 1878 – January 15, 1947) was an American left fielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms/Superbas (1897–98, 1900–01, 1902–05), Baltimore Orioles (NL) (1899), Baltimore Orioles (AL) (1902), Chicago Cubs (1906–12), St. Louis Cardinals (1913) and Cincinnati Reds (1913).

Sheckard was the Chicago Cubs&#x27; leadoff batter for the final game of the 1908 World Series. His team played in four World Series in a five-year span from 1906-1910.

==Career==

Sheckard was born in Chanceford Township, York County, Pennsylvania. He enjoyed a great 1901 season with the Superbas, hitting .353 with 11 home runs and 104 runs batted in, and leading the league with 19 triples and a .534 slugging average. In that season Sheckard became the first and so far only player to hit inside the park grand slams in two consecutive games.

With Baltimore in 1899, Sheckard led the league with 77 stolen bases. He played in four World Series with the Cubs, winning championships in 1907 and 1908; and he led the league in 1911 with 121 runs and 147 walks – a major league record until broken by Babe Ruth in 1920, and still a team record.

Sheckard also had the dubious distinction of going hitless in 21 at-bats in the 1906 World Series, won by the Chicago White Sox over the Cubs.

Sheckard was the first player to lead the league in homers and steals in the same season (1903). Ty Cobb (1909) and Chuck Klein (1932) are the only other players to do so in the majors.

Sheckard was also a good outfielder. He holds the all-time single season major league record for double plays at two separate positions. His 12 double plays as a left fielder in 1911 for the Cubs are two more than any other left fielder in history. In 1899, while playing for the Baltimore Orioles, Sheckard played right field and set the record for double plays by a right fielder with 14. See related article on all time double play leaders.

After the 1913 season, Sheckard retired. When the Reds traded Joe Tinker, creating a managerial vacancy, Sheckard warned that Tinker&#x27;s replacement would have a tough job ahead. &quot;No matter who gets Tinker&#x27;s place, the new manager will have to get rid of the &#x27;knockers&#x27; on that club before he can hope to succeed. There is no chance to win with players who think more of their own records than they do of the success of the club.&quot;

In his 17-year career, Sheckard hit .274, with 56 home runs, 813 RBI, 1296 runs, 354 doubles, 136 triples, and 465 stolen bases in 2122 games played. In 1911, he set the single season record for walks with 147 before it was broken by Babe Ruth in 1920. He is one of only four players in the modern era (1900-present) to hold this record along with Ruth, Jack Crooks, and Barry Bonds. Sheckard is also the all-time leader among left fielders in assists, with 243.

Sheckard died at age 68 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, from injuries suffered when he was struck by a motorist while walking to work along a highway.

==Highlights==
* Twice led league in stolen bases (1899, 1903)
* Led league in home runs (1903)

<text>The South Nation River is a river in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It springs from forests and marshes located north of Brockville, and it flows northeast to empty into the Ottawa River north of Plantagenet. Its watershed covers .

This river is called the &quot;South Nation River&quot; to distinguish it from a river in Quebec north of the Ottawa River called the Petite-Nation River or &quot;rivière Petite-Nation&quot;. The names of both rivers are derived from the French name for the native people of this area, the Weskarini.

The area surrounding the river, originally covered with white pine, is now mainly used for agriculture. The river drains an almost flat plain, and its lack of gradient makes it prone to flooding. Dams and other water control measures have been introduced to help reduce the impact of seasonal flooding in the watershed.

In some areas, the river flows through Leda clays which can be very unstable. Several landslides have occurred over the past century, including a major one near the former town of Lemieux on June 20, 1993. Approximately of mud and clay slid into the river valley, blocking the river&#x27;s flow for three days.

Four kilometers of river to the south of Spencerville is good for canoeing during most water conditions. There is a public boat launch at the old mill.

<doc id="667404" wikidata="Q413683" url="?curid=667404" title="Diazomethane">
<text>Diazomethane is an organic chemical compound with the formula CH2N2, discovered by German chemist Hans von Pechmann in 1894. It is the simplest diazo compound. In the pure form at room temperature, it is an extremely sensitive explosive yellow gas; thus, it is almost universally used as a solution in diethyl ether. The compound is a popular methylating agent in the laboratory, but it is too hazardous to be employed on an industrial scale without special precautions. Use of diazomethane has been significantly reduced by the introduction of the safer and equivalent reagent trimethylsilyldiazomethane.

==Use==
For safety and convenience diazomethane is always prepared as needed as a solution in ether and used as such. It converts carboxylic acids to methyl esters and phenols into their methyl ethers. The reaction is thought to proceed via proton transfer from carboxylic acid to diazomethane to give a methyldiazonium cation, which reacts with the carboxylate ion to give the methyl ester and nitrogen gas. Labeling studies indicate that the initial proton transfer is faster than the methyl transfer step. Since proton transfer is required for the reaction to proceed, this reaction is selective for the more acidic carboxylic acids (p&quot;K&quot;a ~ 5) and phenols (p&quot;K&quot;a ~ 10) over aliphatic alcohols (p&quot;K&quot;a ~ 15). 

In more specialized applications, diazomethane and other diazoalkyl reagents are used in the Arndt–Eistert reaction and the Büchner–Curtius–Schlotterbeck reaction for homologation of various compounds.

Diazomethane reacts with alcohols or phenols in presence of boron trifluoride (BF3) to give methyl ethers.

Diazomethane is also frequently used as a carbene source. It readily takes part in 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions.

==Preparation==
===Laboratory scale===
A wide variety of routes have been developed for the laboratory production of diazomethane. In general, the synthesis of these all involves the addition of methylamine to an electron-deficient species, before treatment with nitrite and mineral acid (nitrous acid) to form an &quot;N&quot;-methyl nitrosamide. Diazomethane is prepared by hydrolysis of an ethereal solution of these &quot;N&quot;-methyl nitrosamides with aqueous base. Examples include:

* &quot;N&quot;-nitroso-&quot;N&quot;-methylurea (NMU), the original precursor first reported by Hans von Pechmann in 1894 and historically one of the most popular choices. Its popularity has slowly waned due to it being unstable at above 20 °C and somewhat shock-sensitive.
* &quot;N&quot;-Nitroso-β-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone (Liquizald), another early precursor which remains in use in the present day.
* &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;″-dimethyl-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;″-dinitrosoterephthalamide (DMDMT)
* &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;&#x27;-nitro-&quot;N&quot;-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), used as both a biochemical tool and a diazomethane source.
* &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitroso-&quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonamide (Diazald), one of the most popular modern precursors.

Diazomethane reacts with alkaline solutions of D2O to give the deuterated derivative CD2N2. This can be used for isotopic labeling studies.

===Industrial use===
The ease with which diazomethane explodes makes it too hazardous to handle in large quantities. Despite this, it can be used on an industrial scale using on-demand flow chemistry. In these processes the rate of production is matched by the rate of consumption, such that the amount of diazomethane present at any one time is very low. 

===Analysis===
The concentration of CH2N2 can be determined in either of two convenient ways. It can be treated with an excess of benzoic acid in cold Et2O. Unreacted benzoic acid is then back-titrated with standard NaOH. Alternatively, the concentration of CH2N2 in Et2O can be determined spectrophotometrically at 410 nm where its extinction coefficient, ε, is 7.2.
The gas-phase concentration of diazomethane can be determined using photoacoustic spectroscopy.

==Related compounds==
Diazomethane is both isomeric and isoelectronic with the more stable cyanamide, but they do not interconvert.
Many substituted derivatives of diazomethane have been prepared:
*The very stable (CF3)2CN2 (2-diazo-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane; b.p. 12–13 °C),
*Ph2CN2 (diazodiphenylmethane; m.p. 29–30 °C).
*(CH3)3SiCHN2 (trimethylsilyldiazomethane), which is commercially available as a solution and is as effective as CH2N2 for methylation.
*PhC(H)N2, a red liquid b.p.&lt; 25 °C at 0.1 mmHg.

==Safety==
Diazomethane is toxic by inhalation or by contact with the skin or eyes (TLV 0.2 ppm). Symptoms include chest discomfort, headache, weakness and, in severe cases, collapse. Symptoms may be delayed. Deaths from diazomethane poisoning have been reported. In one instance a laboratory worker consumed a hamburger near a fumehood where he was generating a large quantity of diazomethane, and died four days later from fulminating pneumonia. Like any other alkylating agent it is expected to be carcinogenic, but such concerns are overshadowed by its serious acute toxicity.

CH2N2 may explode in contact with sharp edges, such as ground-glass joints, even scratches in glassware. Glassware should be inspected before use and preparation should take place behind a blast shield. Specialized kits to prepare diazomethane with flame-polished joints are commercially available.

The compound explodes when heated beyond 100 °C, exposed to intense light, alkali metals, or calcium sulfate. Use of a blast shield is highly recommended while using this compound.

Proof-of-concept work has been done with microfluidics, in which continuous point-of-use synthesis from &quot;N&quot;-methyl-&quot;N&quot;-nitrosourea and 0.93 M potassium hydroxide in water was followed by point-of-use conversion with benzoic acid, resulting in a 65% yield of the methyl benzoate ester within seconds at temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 °C. The yield was better than under capillary conditions; the microfluidics were credited with &quot;suppression of hot spots, low holdup, isothermal conditions, and intensive mixing.&quot;

== Isomers ==
The stable compound cyanamide, whose minor tautomer is carbodiimide, is an isomer of diazomethane. Less stable but still isolable isomers of diazomethane include the cyclic 3&quot;H&quot;-diazirine and isocyanoamine (isodiazomethane). In addition, the parent nitrilimine has been observed under matrix isolation conditions.

<text>Wyatt Emory Cooper (September 1, 1927 – January 5, 1978) was an American author, screenwriter, and actor. He was the fourth husband of Vanderbilt family heiress and socialite Gloria Vanderbilt and the father of CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.

== Life and career ==
Cooper had his childhood in the small town of Pleasant Grove, Mississippi, outside of Quitman, Mississippi, the son of Rixie Jane Annie (née Anderson) and Emmet Debro Cooper. Cooper was from a poor family with deep Southern roots, and later moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, as a young child. He graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he majored in theater arts and began a career in acting.

In his twenties, Cooper moved to New York City to pursue acting. When Cooper was 26, he appeared on Broadway in the cast of &quot;The Strong Are Lonely&quot;, a drama that ran for a week at the Broadhurst Theatre in the fall of 1953. Cooper also wrote stories and plays.

In his thirties, Cooper lived in Los Angeles, attended both UCLA and UC Berkeley, and worked as a screenwriter. While residing in West Hollywood, then an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, Cooper lived near Dorothy Parker and her husband Alan Campbell. A close friendship developed, and a year after Parker&#x27;s death in 1967, Cooper published an incisive and widely read profile in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, titled, &quot;Whatever You Think Dorothy Parker Was Like, She Wasn&#x27;t&quot;. Cooper moved to Manhattan in the early 1960s, and worked there as a magazine editor.

His writing includes the 1962 film &quot;The Chapman Report&quot;, the 1972 film &quot;The Glass House&quot;, and the 1975 book &quot;Families: A Memoir and a Celebration&quot;.

==Personal life==
On December 24, 1963, he married heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, becoming her fourth husband. The couple frequently appeared on the national &quot;best-dressed&quot; list. They had two sons: Carter Vanderbilt Cooper (1965–1988), who died by suicide, and Anderson Hays Cooper (b. 1967), who is an anchor for CNN.

Cooper wrote in his 1975 memoir, &quot;It is in the family that we learn almost all we ever know of loving. In my sons&#x27; youth, their promise, their possibilities, my stake in immortality is invested.&quot; He died in Manhattan on January 5, 1978, at age 50, during open heart surgery, after having a heart attack the previous December.

<text>Ejaz Lakdawala is an Indian gangster from Mumbai, Maharashtra.

In May 2003, he was rumoured to have been killed when Dawood&#x27;s gang-members, also known as D-Company, angered by his allegiance to Chota Rajan, opened fire at him in a crowded market in Bangkok. However, he survived and moved to Canada.

In May 2004, he was arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada following an Interpol red corner notice for him.

In the early morning of 9 January 2020 he was arrested by Mumbai Police. His arrest comes on the heels of his daughter Sonia Lakdawala alias Sonia Shaikh&#x27;s arrest a fortnight ago at Mumbai International Airport, while she was trying to fly to Nepal on a forged passport. Ejaz is involved in more than 20 cases of extortion, attempted murder and rioting.

In March 2024, he was sentenced to life imprisonment over a 1996 murder case.

<doc id="667412" wikidata="Q7887914" url="?curid=667412" title="List of parliaments of England">
<text>This is a list of parliaments of England from the reign of King Henry III, when the &quot;Curia Regis&quot; developed into a body known as Parliament, until the creation of the Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.

For later parliaments, see the List of parliaments of Great Britain. For the history of the English Parliament, see Parliament of England.

The parliaments of England were traditionally referred to by the number counting forward from the start of the reign of a particular monarch, unless the parliament was notable enough to come to be known by a particular title, such as the Good Parliament or the Parliament of Merton.

==Parliaments of Henry III==


==Parliaments of Edward I==


==Parliaments of Edward II==


==Parliaments of Edward III==


==Parliaments of Richard II==
==Parliaments of Henry IV==
==Parliaments of Henry V==
==Parliaments of Henry VI==


==Parliaments of Edward IV==

==Parliament of Richard III==

==Parliaments of Henry VII==
==Parliaments of Henry VIII==
==Parliaments of Edward VI==
==Parliaments of Mary I==
==Parliaments of Elizabeth I==
==Parliaments of James I==
==Parliaments of Charles I==
&quot;The Long Parliament, which commenced in this reign, had the longest term and the most complex history of any English Parliament. The entry in the first table below relates to the whole Parliament. Although it rebelled against King Charles I and continued to exist long after the King&#x27;s death, it was a Parliament he originally summoned. An attempt has been made to set out the different phases of the Parliament in the second table in this section and in subsequent sections. The phases are explained in a note.&quot;

===The Long Parliament (Royalist phases)===


==Parliaments of the Revolution and Commonwealth==


==Parliaments of the Protectorate==
These parliaments included representatives of Scotland and Ireland.

==Parliaments of the Commonwealth==


==Parliaments of Charles II==
==Parliament of James II==
==Parliaments of William III and Mary II==
* Note: The Convention Parliament of 1689 is usually referred to as the 1st Parliament of William &amp; Mary and thus the 1690 parliament is referred to as the &quot;Second Parliament&quot;. The very first act of the 1690 parliament (2 Will. &amp; Mar., c.1) was to legitimise the Convention parliament as a lawfully-summoned parliament.
* Note: Queen Mary II died in December 1694, during the sixth session of the second parliament. Subsequent parliamentary sessions are labelled as &quot;William III&quot; alone (rather than &quot;William &amp; Mary&quot;), but their numbering is not reset. The next parliament (1695) is conventionally called the &quot;third parliament&quot;, the 1698 parliament the &quot;fourth parliament&quot; etc.

==Parliaments of Anne==
On 29 April 1707, the Parliament of Great Britain was constituted. The members of the 2nd Parliament of Queen Anne became part of the 1st Parliament of Great Britain.

<doc id="667428" wikidata="Q644318" url="?curid=667428" title="Vasculitis">
<text>Vasculitis is a group of disorders that destroy blood vessels by inflammation. Both arteries and veins are affected. Lymphangitis (inflammation of lymphatic vessels) is sometimes considered a type of vasculitis. Vasculitis is primarily caused by leukocyte migration and resultant damage. Although both occur in vasculitis, inflammation of veins (phlebitis) or arteries (arteritis) on their own are separate entities.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The clinical presentation of the various vasculitides on the skin and internal organs is mostly determined by the diameter or size of the vessels mainly affected. Non-specific symptoms are common and include fever, headache, fatigue, myalgia, weight loss, and arthralgia.

All forms of vasculitis, even large vessel vasculitides, may cause skin manifestations. The most common skin manifestations include purpura, nodules, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, and purpuric urticaria.
== Causes ==
There are several different etiologies for vasculitides. Although infections usually involve vessels as a component of more extensive tissue damage, they can also directly or indirectly cause vasculitic syndromes through immune-mediated secondary events. Simple vascular thrombosis usually only affects the luminal process, but through the process of thrombus organization, it can also occasionally cause a more chronic vasculitic syndrome. The autoimmune etiologies, a particular family of diseases characterized by dysregulated immune responses that produce particular pathophysiologic signs and symptoms, are more prevalent.

== Classification ==
Primary systemic, secondary, and single-organ vasculitis are distinguished using the highest classification level in the 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference nomenclature.

=== Primary systemic vasculitis ===

Primary systemic vasculitis is categorized by the size of the vessels mainly involved. Primary systemic vasculitis includes large-vessel vasculitis, medium-vessel vasculitis, small-vessel vasculitis, and variable-vessel vasculitis.

==== Large vessel vasculitis ====
The 2012 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference defines large vessel vasculitis (LVV) as a type of vasculitis that can affect any size artery, but it usually affects the aorta and its major branches more frequently than other vasculitides. Takayasu arteritis (TA) and giant cell arteritis (GCA) are the two main forms of LVV.

==== Medium vessel vasculitis ====
Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV) is a type of vasculitis that mostly affects the medium arteries, which are the major arteries that supply the viscera and their branches. Any size artery could be impacted, though. The two primary types are polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and Kawasaki disease (KD).

==== Small vessel vasculitis ====
Small vessel vasculitis (SVV) is separated into immune complex SVV and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a necrotizing vasculitis linked to MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA that primarily affects small vessels and has few or no immune deposits. AAV is further classified as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).

Immune complex small vessel vasculitis (SVV) is vasculitis that primarily affects small vessels and has moderate to significant immunoglobulin and complement component deposits on the vessel wall. Normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis), cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV), IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein) (IgAV), and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease are the categories of immune complex SVV.

==== Variable vessel vasculitis ====
Variable vessel vasculitis (VVV) is a kind of vasculitis that may impact vessels of all sizes (small, medium, and large) and any type (arteries, veins, and capillaries), with no particular type of vessel being predominantly affected. This category includes Behcet&#x27;s disease (BD) and Cogan&#x27;s syndrome (CS).

=== Secondary vasculitis ===
The subset of illnesses known as secondary vasculitis are those believed to be brought on by an underlying ailment or exposure. Systemic illnesses (such as rheumatoid arthritis), cancer, drug exposure, and infection are the primary causes of vasculitis; however, there are still few factors that have a conclusively shown pathogenic relationship to the condition. Vasculitis frequently coexists with infections, and several infections, including hepatitis B and C, HIV, infective endocarditis, and tuberculosis, are significant secondary causes of vasculitis. Except for rheumatoid vasculitis, the majority of secondary vasculitis forms are exceedingly rare.

=== Single-organ vasculitis ===
Single-organ vasculitis, formerly known as &quot;localized,&quot; &quot;limited,&quot; &quot;isolated,&quot; or &quot;nonsystemic&quot; vasculitis, refers to vasculitis that is limited to one organ or organ system. Examples of this type of vasculitis include gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and peripheral nerve vasculitis.

== Diagnosis ==
* Laboratory tests of blood or body fluids are performed for patients with active vasculitis. Their results will generally show signs of inflammation in the body, such as increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia, increased white blood cell count and eosinophilia. Other possible findings are elevated antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels and hematuria.
* Other organ functional tests may be abnormal. Specific abnormalities depend on the degree of various organs involvement. A brain SPECT can show decreased blood flow to the brain and brain damage.
* The definite diagnosis of vasculitis is established after a biopsy of involved organ or tissue, such as skin, sinuses, lung, nerve, brain, and kidney. The biopsy elucidates the pattern of blood vessel inflammation.
:*Some types of vasculitis display leukocytoclasis, which is vascular damage caused by nuclear debris from infiltrating neutrophils. It typically presents as palpable purpura. Conditions with leucocytoclasis mainly include hypersensitivity vasculitis (also called &quot;leukocytoclastic&quot; vasculitis) and cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis (also called cutaneous &quot;leukocytoclastic&quot; angiitis).
* An alternative to biopsy can be an angiogram (x-ray test of the blood vessels). It can demonstrate characteristic patterns of inflammation in affected blood vessels.
* 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT)has become a widely used imaging tool in patients with suspected Large Vessel Vasculitis, due to the enhanced glucose metabolism of inflamed vessel walls. The combined evaluation of the intensity and the extension of FDG vessel uptake at diagnosis can predict the clinical course of the disease, separating patients with favourable or complicated progress.
* Acute onset of vasculitis-like symptoms in small children or babies may instead be the life-threatening purpura fulminans, usually associated with severe infection.

In this table: ANA = antinuclear antibodies, CRP = C-reactive protein, ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, &quot;ds&quot;DNA = double-stranded DNA, ENA = extractable nuclear antigens, RNP = ribonucleoproteins; VDRL = Venereal Disease Research Laboratory

== Treatment ==
Treatments are generally directed toward stopping the inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Typically, corticosteroids such as prednisone are used. Additionally, other immune suppression medications, such as cyclophosphamide, are considered. In case of an infection, antimicrobial agents including cephalexin may be prescribed. Affected organs (such as the heart or lungs) may require specific medical treatment intended to improve their function during the active phase of the disease.

<doc id="667433" wikidata="Q484808" url="?curid=667433" title="Samuel Kobia">
<text>Samuel Kobia (born March 20, 1947, in Miathene, Meru, Kenya), is a Methodist clergyman and the first African to be elected General Secretary (2004–2009) of the World Council of Churches (WCC), a worldwide fellowship of 349 global, regional and local churches representing a Christian population of over 590 million people. In 2010, Kobia was appointed Ecumenical Special Envoy to Sudan by the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC). Kobia is married to Ruth, and they have two daughters, Kaburo and Nkatha, and two sons, Mwenda and Mutua.

==Early life==
Sam Kobia grew up in a rural home in Meru, eastern province of Kenya, where he completed primary and secondary education under the British colonial system. His ecumenical career began with his studies at St. Paul&#x27;s University, Limuru, Kenya), where he graduated with a diploma in Theology in 1971.

==Study and work abroad==
Kobia then moved to Chicago and enrolled in the McCormick Theological Seminary to study urban ministry. His interest in urbanization and its impact on African cities lead him to continue further exploration in this field. He applied and was accepted to the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he graduated with a Masters in City Planning (MCP) in 1978. His thesis paper for his Master&#x27;s is titled &quot;Origins of squatting and community organization in Nairobi&quot;.

In 1978, after graduating from MIT, Kobia and his family moved to Geneva, Switzerland, to take up the post of executive secretary for Urban Rural Mission at the World Council of Churches (WCC). Kobia spent most of his career at the WCC.From 1978 to 1984, he was executive secretary for Urban Mission at the WCC in Geneva, and served as secretary of the WCC Africa task force. He would eventually head the international organization from 2004 to 2009.

In 1993, Kobia earned a Doctor of Divinity (honorary degree) from the Christian Theological Seminary in Indianapolis. 
In 2000, he spent a sabbatical year as a fellow at the Center for the Study of Values in Public Life at Harvard Divinity School, Harvard University.

==Return to Kenya==
In 1984, Kobia returned to his home country to serve as Director of Church Development activities at the National Council of Churches of Kenya (NCCK). Three years later, in 1987 he was elected General Secretary of NCCK. He served as General Secretary from 1987 to 1993. Under his leadership, the NCCK was vocal about the need for multi-party politics in Kenya and campaigned against repression during the Moi era.

==Global Leadership==
From Kenya, he returned to Geneva, Switzerland in 1993 to serve as Executive Director of WCC&#x27;s Unit III - Justice, Peace and Creation. In 2003 he was elected General Secretary; his election was received with endorsement by global peers. During his acceptance speech he quoted the African proverb &quot;If you want to walk fast, walk alone; but if you want to walk far, walk together&quot;. In this spirit, he worked to promote greater unity in the ecumenical movement through collaboration and dialogue.

In 2005, he rejected the accusation of anti-Zionism against the WCC and stated that anti-Semitism is a &quot;sin against God and man&quot; and &quot;absolutely irreconcilable with the profession and practice of the Christian faith,&quot; quoting from the first assembly of the WCC in Amsterdam in 1948. He has nevertheless been critical of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, calling it &quot;a sin against God&quot;.

The same year, he paid a tribute to Pope John Paul II on behalf of his efforts for ecumenism.

Kobia served as General Secretary for one term resigning in 2009. Kobia&#x27;s resignation come as a surprise to the Central Committee, who stated that he had their &quot;full support&quot; despite harsh criticism from Rt. Rev. Martin Hein.

In 2010, Kobia was appointed Ecumenical Special Envoy to Sudan by the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC). Kobia has deep knowledge of Sudan having worked with the late John Garang in 1990 when the WCC set up peace talks between the mainstream SPLM/SPLA led by John Garang and the SPLM/SPLA United led by Riak Machduring. Kobia led the six-month-long talks, which were sponsored by the National Council of Churches of Kenya and the People for Peace of the Catholic Church in Kenya, with technical assistance from Nairobi Peace Initiative-Africa. In this current post, he continues his role as peacemaker and global leader.

==Selected publications==
Kobia has written numerous papers and articles on Africa, peace and ecumenism. His publications reflects his vision, his working experiences. He is the author of the following books:
*&quot;Dialogue Matters: The Role of Ecumenical Diplomacy in the Run-up to the Independence of South Sudan (2013)&quot;
*&quot;South Sudan: Free at Last (2011)&quot;
*&quot;Celebrating Life: A Festa da Vida&quot; (2007)
*&quot;Called to the one hope: a new ecumenical epoch&quot; (2006)
*&quot;The courage to hope: the roots for a new vision and the calling of the church in Africa&quot; (2003)
*&quot;Why you should vote&quot; (1992)
*&quot;The old and the new NGOs: approaches to development&quot; (1985)
*&quot;The origins of squatting and community organization in Nairobi&quot; (1978)

===Early life and career===
McBee was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States. He studied clarinet at school, but switched to bass at the age of 17, and began playing in local nightclubs. After gaining a music degree from Ohio Central State University, McBee spent two years in the U.S. Army, during which time he conducted the band at Fort Knox. In 1959, he played with Dinah Washington, and in 1962 he moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he worked with Paul Winter&#x27;s folk-rock ensemble between 1963 and 1964.

===New York===
His jazz career began to take off in the mid-1960s, after he moved to New York, when he began playing and recording with a number of significant musicians including Miles Davis, Andrew Hill, Sam Rivers, Jackie McLean (1964), Wayne Shorter (1965–66), Charles Lloyd (1966), Yusef Lateef (1967–69), Keith Jarrett, Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw (1986), and Alice Coltrane (1969–72).

===Later career===
In the 2000s, McBee unsuccessfully sued a Japanese company that opened a chain of stores under his name.

<text>The Seabed Arms Control Treaty (or Seabed Treaty, formally the Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil thereof) is a multilateral agreement between the United States, Soviet Union (now Russia), United Kingdom, and 91 other countries banning the emplacement of nuclear weapons or &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot; on the ocean floor beyond a 12-mile (22.2 km) coastal zone. It allows signatories to observe all seabed &quot;activities&quot; of any other signatory beyond the 12-mile zone to ensure compliance.

Like the Antarctic Treaty, the Outer Space Treaty, and the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone treaties, the Seabed Arms Control Treaty sought to prevent the introduction of international conflict and nuclear weapons into an area hitherto free of them. Reaching agreement on the seabed, however, involved problems that were not met in framing the other two agreements.

==History==
In the 1960s, advances in the technology of oceanography and greatly increased interest in the vast and virtually untapped resources of the ocean floor led to concern that the absence of clearly established rules of law might lead to strife. There were concurrent fears that nations might use the seabed as a new environment for military installations, including those capable of launching nuclear weapons.

In keeping with a proposal submitted to the U.N. Secretary General by Ambassador Pardo of Malta in August 1967, the U.N. General Assembly, on 18 December 1967, established an ad hoc committee to study ways of reserving the seabed for peaceful purposes, with the objective of ensuring &quot;that the exploration and use of the seabed and the ocean floor should be conducted in accordance with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in the interests of maintaining international peace and security and for the benefit of all mankind.&quot; The committee was given permanent status the following year. At the same time, seabed-related military and arms control issues were referred to the Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (ENDC) and its successor, the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD). In a message of 18 March 1969, President Nixon said the American delegation to the ENDC should seek discussion of the factors necessary for an international agreement prohibiting the emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on the seabed and ocean floor and pointed out that an agreement of this kind would, like the Antarctic and Outer Space treaties, &quot;prevent an arms race before it has a chance to start.&quot;

==Status==

===List of parties===
The Seabed Arms Control Treaty was opened for signature in Washington, London, and Moscow on 11 February 1971. It entered into force 18 May 1972, when the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and more than 22 nations had deposited instruments of ratification. As of October 2018, 94 current states are parties to the treaty, while another 21 have signed the treaty but have not completed ratification.

Multiple dates indicate the different days in which states submitted their signature or deposition, which varied by location. This location is noted by: (L) for London, (M) for Moscow, and (W) for Washington.

;Notes
===State with limited recognition, abiding by treaty===
The Republic of China (Taiwan), which is currently only recognized by , deposited their instruments of ratification of the treaty prior to the United States&#x27; decision to switch their recognition of the sole legitimate government of China from the Republic of China (ROC) to the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1971. When the PRC subsequently ratified the treaty, they described the ROC&#x27;s ratification as &quot;illegal&quot;. The ROC has committed itself to continue to adhere to the requirements of the treaty, and the United States has declared that they still consider them to be &quot;bound by its obligations&quot;.

<doc id="667443" wikidata="Q2984985" url="?curid=667443" title="Ternary conditional operator">
<text>In computer programming, the ternary conditional operator is a ternary operator that is part of the syntax for basic conditional expressions in several programming languages. It is commonly referred to as the conditional operator, conditional expression, ternary if, or inline if (abbreviated iif). An expression or evaluates to if the value of is true, and otherwise to . One can read it aloud as &quot;if a then b otherwise c&quot;. The form is the most common, but alternative syntax do exist; for example, Raku uses the syntax to avoid confusion with the infix operators and , whereas in Visual Basic .NET, it instead takes the form .

It originally comes from CPL, in which equivalent syntax for codice_1 was codice_2.

Although many ternary operators are possible, the conditional operator is so common, and other ternary operators so rare, that the conditional operator is commonly referred to as &quot;the&quot; ternary operator.

==Variations==
The detailed semantics of &quot;the&quot; ternary operator as well as its syntax differs significantly from language to language.

A top level distinction from one language to another is whether the expressions permit side effects (as in most procedural languages) and whether the language provides short-circuit evaluation semantics, whereby only the selected expression is evaluated (most standard operators in most languages evaluate all arguments).

If the language supports expressions with side effects but does not specify short-circuit evaluation, then a further distinction exists about which expression evaluates first—if the language guarantees any specific order (bear in mind that the conditional also counts as an expression).

Furthermore, if no order is guaranteed, a distinction exists about whether the result is then classified as indeterminate (the value obtained from &quot;some&quot; order) or undefined (any value at all at the whim of the compiler in the face of side effects, or even a crash).

If the language does not permit side-effects in expressions (common in functional languages), then the order of evaluation has no value semantics—though it may yet bear on whether an infinite recursion terminates, or have other performance implications (in a functional language with match expressions, short-circuit evaluation is inherent, and natural uses for the ternary operator arise less often, so this point is of limited concern).

For these reasons, in some languages the statement form can have subtly different semantics than the block conditional form (in the C language—the syntax of the example given—these are in fact equivalent).

The associativity of nested ternary operators can also differ from language to language. In almost all languages, the ternary operator is right associative so that evaluates intuitively as , but PHP in particular is notoriously left-associative, and evaluates as follows: , which is rarely what any programmer expects. (The given examples assume that the ternary operator has low operator precedence, which is true in all C-family languages, and many others.)

==Equivalence to map==
The ternary operator can also be viewed as a binary map operation.

In R—and other languages with literal expression tuples—one can simulate the ternary operator with something like the R expression (this idiom is slightly more natural in languages with 0-origin subscripts).
Nested ternaries can be simulated as where the function returns the index of the first true value in the condition vector. Note that both of these map equivalents are binary operators, revealing that the ternary operator is ternary in syntax, rather than semantics. These constructions can be regarded as a weak form of currying based on data concatenation rather than function composition.

If the language provides a mechanism of futures or promises, then short-circuit evaluation can sometimes also be simulated in the context of a binary map operation.

==Conditional assignment==
Originally from ALGOL 60 the conditional assignment of ALGOL is:

 &quot;variable&quot; := if &quot;condition&quot; then &quot;expression_1&quot; else &quot;expression_2&quot;;

 is used as follows:

 &quot;condition&quot; ? &quot;value_if_true&quot; : &quot;value_if_false&quot;

The &quot;condition&quot; is evaluated &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as a Boolean expression. On the basis of the evaluation of the Boolean condition, the entire expression returns &quot;value_if_true&quot; if &quot;condition&quot; is true, but &quot;value_if_false&quot; otherwise. Usually the two sub-expressions &quot;value_if_true&quot; and &quot;value_if_false&quot; must have the same type, which determines the type of the whole expression. The importance of this type-checking lies in the operator&#x27;s most common use—in conditional assignment statements. In this usage it appears as an expression on the right side of an assignment statement, as follows:

 &quot;variable&quot; = &quot;condition&quot; ? &quot;value_if_true&quot; : &quot;value_if_false&quot;;

The ?: operator is similar to the way conditional expressions (if-then-else constructs) work in functional programming languages, like Scheme, ML, Haskell, and XQuery, since if-then-else forms an expression instead of a statement in those languages.

==Usage==
The conditional operator&#x27;s most common usage is to create a terse, simple conditional assignment. For example, if we wish to implement some C code to change a shop&#x27;s normal opening hours from 9 o&#x27;clock to 12 o&#x27;clock on Sundays, we may use
int opening_time = (day == SUNDAY) ? 12 : 9;
instead of the more verbose
int opening_time;

if (day == SUNDAY)
 opening_time = 12;
else
 opening_time = 9;
The two forms are nearly equivalent. Keep in mind that the is an expression and if-then-else is a statement. Note that neither the &quot;true&quot; nor &quot;false&quot; portions can be omitted from the conditional operator without an error report upon parsing. This contrasts with if-then-else statements, where the else clause can be omitted.

Most of the languages emphasizing functional programming don&#x27;t need such an operator as their regular conditional expression(s) is an expression in the first place e.g. the Scheme expression is equivalent in semantics to the C expression . This is also the case in many imperative languages, starting with ALGOL where it is possible to write , or Smalltalk () or Ruby (, although works as well).

Note that some languages may evaluate &quot;both&quot; the true- and false-expressions, even though only one or the other will be assigned to the variable. This means that if the true- or false-expression contain a function call, that function may be called and executed (causing any related side-effects due to the function&#x27;s execution), regardless of whether or not its result will be used. Programmers should consult their programming language specifications or test the ternary operator to determine whether or not the language will evaluate both expressions in this way. If it does, and this is not the desired behaviour, then an if-then-else statement should be used.

===ActionScript 3===

condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
===Ada===
The 2012 edition of Ada has introduced conditional expressions (using and ), as part of an enlarged set of expressions including quantified expressions and expression functions. The Rationale for Ada 2012 states motives for Ada not having had them before, as well as motives for now adding them, such as to support &quot;contracts&quot; (also new).
Pay_per_Hour := (if Day = Sunday
 then 12.50
 else 10.00);
When the value of an &quot;if_expression&quot; is itself of Boolean type, then the part may be omitted, the value being True. Multiple conditions may chained using .

=== ALGOL 60 ===

ALGOL 60 introduced conditional expressions (thus ternary conditionals) to imperative programming languages.

 if &lt;boolean expression&gt; then &lt;expression&gt; else &lt;expression&gt;

Rather than a conditional statement:
integer opening_time;

if day = Sunday then
 opening_time := 12;
else
 opening_time := 9;
the programmer could use the conditional expression to write more succinctly:
integer opening_time;

opening_time := if day = Sunday then 12 else 9;
===ALGOL 68===
Both ALGOL 68&#x27;s choice clauses (if and the case clauses) provide the coder with a choice of &quot;either&quot; the &quot;bold&quot; syntax or the &quot;&quot;brief&quot; form.

* Single if choice clause:
 if condition then statements [ else statements ] fi
*: &quot;brief&quot; form: codice_3

* Chained if choice clause:
 if condition1 then statements elif condition2 then statements [ else statements ] fi
*: &quot;brief&quot;&quot; form: codice_4

===APL===
With the following syntax, both expressions are evaluated (with evaluated first, then , then ):
result ← value_if_true ⊣⍣ condition ⊢ value_if_false
This alternative syntax provides short-circuit evaluation:
result ← { condition : expression_if_true ⋄ expression_if_false } ⍬
===AWK===

result = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
===Bash===
A true ternary operator only exists for arithmetic expressions:
((result = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false))
For strings there only exist workarounds, like e.g.:
result=$( &quot;$a&quot; = &quot;$b&quot;  &amp;&amp; echo &quot;value_if_true&quot; || echo &quot;value_if_false&quot;)
Where can be any condition construct can evaluate. Instead of the there can be any other bash command. When it exits with success, the first echo command is executed, otherwise the second one is executed.

===C===
A traditional if-else construct in C is written:
if (a &gt; b) {
 result = x;
else {
 result = y;


This can be rewritten as the following statement:
result = a &gt; b ? x : y;
As in the if-else construct only one of the expressions &#x27;x&#x27; and &#x27;y&#x27; is evaluated. This is significant if the evaluation of &#x27;x&#x27; or &#x27;y&#x27; has side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1999&quot;&gt;ISO.IEC 9899:1999 (E) 6.5.15.4&lt;/ref&gt; The behaviour is undefined if an attempt is made to use the result of the conditional operator as an lvalue.

A GNU extension to C allows omitting the second operand, and using implicitly the first operand as the second also:
a = x ? : y;
The expression is equivalent to
a = x ? x : y;
except that expressions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are evaluated only once. The difference is significant if evaluating the expression has side effects. This shorthand form is sometimes known as the Elvis operator in other languages.

===C#===
In C#, if condition is true, first expression is evaluated and becomes the result; if false, the second expression is evaluated and becomes the result. As with Java only one of two expressions is ever evaluated.
// condition ? first_expression : second_expression;

static double sinc(double x) 
 return x != 0.0 ? Math.Sin(x) / x : 1.0;


===C++===
Unlike in C, the precedence of the operator in C++ is the same as that of the assignment operator ( or ), and it can return an lvalue. This means that expressions like and are both legal and are parsed differently, the former being equivalent to .

In C++ there are conditional assignment situations where use of the &quot;if-else&quot; statement is impossible, since this language explicitly distinguishes between initialization and assignment. In such case it is always possible to use a function call, but this can be cumbersome and inelegant. For example, to pass conditionally different values as an argument for a constructor of a field or a base class, it is impossible to use a plain &quot;if-else&quot; statement; in this case we can use a conditional assignment expression, or a function call. Bear in mind also that some types allow initialization, but do not allow assignment, or even that the assignment operator and the constructor do totally different things. This last is true for reference types, for example:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 std::string name;
 std::ofstream fout;

 if (argc &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; argv[1])
 name = argv[1];
 fout.open(name.c_str(), std::ios::out | std::ios::app);

 std::ostream &amp;sout = name.empty() ? std::cout : fout;

 sout « &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;

 return 0;


In this case, using an if-else statement in place of the operator forces the target of the assignment to be declared outside of the branches as a pointer, which can be freely rebound to different objects.
std::ostream* sout = &amp;fout;
if (name.empty()) {
 sout = &amp;std::cout;
*sout « &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
In this simple example, the pointer can be initialized to a default value, mitigating the risk of leaving pointers uninitialized or null. Nevertheless, there are cases when no good default exists or creating a default value is expensive. More generally speaking, keeping track of a nullable pointer increases cognitive load. Therefore, only conditional assignment to a reference through the operator conveys the semantics of &quot;Initializing a variable from only one of two choices based on a predicate&quot; appropriately.

Furthermore, the conditional operator can yield an lvalue, i.e. a value to which another value can be assigned. Consider the following example:
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
 int a = 0;
 int b = 0;

 (argc &gt; 1 ? a : b) = 1;

 std::cout « &quot;a: &quot; « a
 « &quot; b: &quot; « b
 « &#x27;\n&#x27;;

 return 0;


In this example, if the boolean expression yields the value on line 8, the value is assigned to the variable , otherwise the value is assigned to the variable .

===CFML===
Example of the operator in CFML:
result = randRange(0,1) ? &quot;heads&quot; : &quot;tails&quot;;
Roughly 50% of the time the expression will return 1 (true) or 0 (false); meaning result will take the value &quot;heads&quot; or &quot;tails&quot; respectively.

====Lucee, Railo, and ColdFusion 11-specific====
Lucee, Railo, and ColdFusion 11 also implement the Elvis operator, which will return the value of the expression if it is not-null, otherwise the specified default.

Syntax:
result = expression ?: value_if_expression_is_null
Example:
result = f() ?: &quot;default&quot;;

// where...
function f(){
 if (randRange(0,1)){ // either 0 or 1 (false / true)
 return &quot;value&quot;;
}

writeOutput(result);
The function will return roughly 50% of the time, otherwise will not return anything. If returns &quot;value&quot;, will take that value, otherwise will take the value &quot;default&quot;.

===CoffeeScript===
Example of using this operator in CoffeeScript:
if 1 is 2 then &quot;true value&quot; else &quot;false value&quot;
Returns &quot;false value&quot;.

===Common Lisp===
Assignment using a conditional expression in Common Lisp:
(setq result (if (&gt; a b) x y))
Alternative form:
(if (&gt; a b)
 (setq result x)
 (setq result y))
===Crystal===
Example of using this operator in Crystal:
1 == 2 ? &quot;true value&quot; : &quot;false value&quot;
Returns .

The Crystal compiler transforms conditional operators to expressions, so the above is semantically identical to:
if 1 == 2
 &quot;true value&quot;
else
 &quot;false value&quot;
end
===Dart===
The Dart programming language&#x27;s syntax belongs to the C family, primarily inspired by languages like Java, C# and JavaScript, which means it has inherited the traditional syntax for its conditional expression.

Example:
return x.isEven ? x ~/ 2 : x * 3 + 1;
Like other conditions in Dart, the expression before the must evaluate to a Boolean value.

The Dart syntax uses both and in various other ways, which causes ambiguities in the language grammar. An expression like:
{ x as T ? [1] : [2] }
could be parsed as either a &quot;set literal&quot; containing one of two lists &quot;or&quot; as a &quot;map literal&quot; codice_5. The language always chooses the conditional expression in such situations.

Dart also has a second ternary operator, the operator commonly used for setting values in lists or maps, which makes the term &quot;the ternary operator&quot; ambiguous in a Dart context.

===Delphi===
In Delphi the function can be used to achieve the same as . If the library is used, the function returns a numeric value such as an Integer, Double or Extended. If the library is used, this function can also return a string value.

Using 
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: Integer; const AFalse: Integer): Integer;
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: Int64; const AFalse: Int64): Int64;
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: UInt64; const AFalse: UInt64): UInt64;
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: Single; const AFalse: Single): Single;
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: Double; const AFalse: Double): Double;
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: Extended; const AFalse: Extended): Extended;
Using the library
function IfThen(AValue: Boolean; const ATrue: string; AFalse: string = &quot;): string;
Usage example:
function GetOpeningTime(Weekday: Integer): Integer;
begin
 { This function will return the opening time for the given weekday: 12 for Sundays, 9 for other days }
 Result := IfThen((Weekday = 1) or (Weekday = 7), 12, 9);
end;
Unlike a true ternary operator however, both of the results are evaluated prior to performing the comparison. For example, if one of the results is a call to a function which inserts a row into a database table, that function will be called whether or not the condition to return that specific result is met.

=== Eiffel ===

The original Eiffel pure OO language from 1986 did not have conditional expressions. Extensions to Eiffel to integrate the style and benefits of functional in the form of agents (closely associated with functional lambdas) were proposed and implemented in 2014.

 if &lt;boolean expression&gt; then &lt;expression&gt; else &lt;expression&gt;
opening_time: INTEGER

opening_time := if day = Sunday then 12 else 9
===F#===

In F# the built-in syntax for if-then-else is already an expression that always must return a value.
let num = if x = 10 then 42 else 24
F# has a special case where you can omit the else branch if the return value is of type unit. This way you can do side-effects, without using an else branch.
if x = 10 then
 printfn &quot;It is 10&quot;
But even in this case, the if expression would return unit. You don&#x27;t need to write the else branch, because the compiler will assume the unit type on else.

===FORTH===
Since FORTH is a stack-oriented language, and any expression can leave a value on the stack, all // sequences can generate values:
: test ( n -- n ) 1 AND IF 22 ELSE 42 THEN ;
This word takes 1 parameter on the stack, and if that number is odd, leaves 22. If it&#x27;s even, 42 is left on the stack.

===Fortran===
As part of the Fortran-90 Standard, the ternary operator was added to Fortran as the intrinsic function :
variable = merge(x,y,a&gt;b)
Note that both x and y are evaluated before the results of one or the other are returned from the function. Here, x is returned if the condition holds true and y otherwise.

Fortran-2023 has added conditional expressions which evaluate one or the other of the expressions based on the conditional expression:
variable = ( a &gt; b ? x : y )
=== FreeMarker ===
This built-in exists since FreeMarker 2.3.20.

Used like codice_6, fills the same role as the ternary operator in C-like languages.
&lt;#assign x = 10&gt;
&lt;#assign y = 20&gt;
&lt;#-- Prints the maximum of x and y: --&gt;
${(x &gt; y)?then(x, y)}
===Go===
There is no ternary if in Go, so use of the full if statement is always required.

===Haskell===
The built-in if-then-else syntax is inline: the expression
if predicate then expr1 else expr2
has type
Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
The base library also provides the function :
bool :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool -&gt; a
In both cases, no special treatment is needed to ensure that only the selected expression is evaluated, since Haskell is non-strict by default. This also means an operator can be defined that, when used in combination with the operator, functions exactly like in most languages:
(?) :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
(?) pred x y = if pred then x else y
infix 1 ?

-- example (vehicle will evaluate to &quot;airplane&quot;):
arg = &#x27;A&#x27;
vehicle = arg == &#x27;B&#x27; ? &quot;boat&quot; $
 arg == &#x27;A&#x27; ? &quot;airplane&quot; $
 arg == &#x27;T&#x27; ? &quot;train&quot; $
 &quot;car&quot;
However, it is more idiomatic to use pattern guards
-- example (vehicle will evaluate to &quot;airplane&quot;):
arg = &#x27;A&#x27;
vehicle | arg == &#x27;B&#x27; = &quot;boat&quot;
 | arg == &#x27;A&#x27; = &quot;airplane&quot;
 | arg == &#x27;T&#x27; = &quot;train&quot;
 | otherwise = &quot;car&quot;
===Java===
In Java this expression evaluates to:
// If foo is selected, assign selected foo to bar. If not, assign baz to bar.
Object bar = foo.isSelected() ? foo : baz; 
Note that Java, in a manner similar to C#, only evaluates the used expression and will not evaluate the unused expression.

===Julia===
In Julia, &quot;Note that the spaces around and are mandatory: an expression like is not a valid ternary expression (but a newline is acceptable after both the and the ).&quot;

===JavaScript===
The conditional operator in JavaScript is similar to that of C++ and Java, except for the fact the middle expression cannot be a comma expression. Also, as in C++, but unlike in C or Perl, it will not bind tighter than an assignment to its right— is equivalent to instead of .
var timeout = settings === null ? 1000 : settings.timeout;
Just like C# and Java, the expression will only be evaluated if, and only if, the expression is the matching one for the condition given; the other expression will not be evaluated.

=== Lisp ===

As the first functional programming language, Lisp naturally has conditional expressions since there are no statements and thus not conditional statements. The form is:

(if test-expression then-expression else-expression)

Hence:

(if (= day &#x27;Sunday) 12 9)

=== Kotlin ===
Kotlin does not include the traditional ternary operator, however, s can be used as expressions that can be assigned, achieving the same results. Note that, as the complexity of one&#x27;s conditional statement grows, the programmer might consider replacing their - expression with a expression.
val max = if (a &gt; b) a else b
=== Lua ===
Lua does not have a traditional conditional operator. However, the short-circuiting behaviour of its and operators allows the emulation of this behaviour:
-- equivalent to var = cond ? a : b;
var = cond and a or b
This will succeed unless is logically false (i.e. or ); in this case, the expression will always result in . This can result in some surprising behaviour if ignored.

There are also other variants that can be used, but they&#x27;re generally more verbose:
-- parentheses around the table literal are required
var = (
 [true] = a,
 [false] = b
)[not not cond]
Luau, a dialect of Lua, has ternary expressions that look like if statements, but unlike them, they have no keyword, and the clause is required. One may optionally add clauses. It&#x27;s designed to replace the idiom and is expected to work properly in all cases.
-- in Luau
var = if cond then a else b

-- with elseif clause
sign = if var &lt; 0 then -1 elseif var == 0 then 0 else 1
=== Objective-C ===
condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
int min = (1 &lt; 2) ? 1 : 2;
This will set the variable to because the condition is .

=== Pascal ===

Pascal was both a simplification and extension of ALGOL 60 (mainly for handling user-defined types).
One simplification was to remove the conditional expression since the same could be achieved with the less succinct conditional statement form.

=== Perl ===

A traditional if-else construct in Perl is written:
if ($a &gt; $b) {
 $result = $x;
} else {
 $result = $y;


Rewritten to use the conditional operator:
$result = $a &gt; $b ? $x : $y;
The precedence of the conditional operator in Perl is the same as in C, not as in C++. This is conveniently of higher precedence than a comma operator but lower than the precedence of most operators used in expressions within the ternary operator, so the use of parentheses is rarely required.

Its associativity matches that of C and C++, not that of PHP. Unlike C but like C++, Perl allows the use of the conditional expression as an L-value; for example:
$a &gt; $b ? $x : $y = $result;
will assign to either or depending on the logical expression&#x27;s boolean result.

The respective precedence rules and associativities of the operators used guarantee that the version absent any parentheses is equivalent to this explicitly parenthesized version:
(($a &gt; $b) ? $x : $y) = $result;
This is equivalent to the if-else version:
if ($a &gt; $b) {
 $x = $result;
} else {
 $y = $result;


===PHP===
A simple PHP implementation is this:
$abs = $value &gt;= 0 ? $value : -$value;
Unlike most other programming languages, the conditional operator in PHP is left associative rather than right associative. Thus, given a value of T for arg, the PHP code in the following example would yield the value horse instead of train as one might expect:
&lt;?php
$arg = &quot;T&quot;;
$vehicle = ( ( $arg == &#x27;B&#x27; ) ? &#x27;bus&#x27; : 
 ( $arg == &#x27;A&#x27; ) ? &#x27;airplane&#x27; : 
 ( $arg == &#x27;T&#x27; ) ? &#x27;train&#x27; : 
 ( $arg == &#x27;C&#x27; ) ? &#x27;car&#x27; : 
 ( $arg == &#x27;H&#x27; ) ? &#x27;horse&#x27; : 
 &#x27;feet&#x27; );
echo $vehicle;
The reason is that nesting two conditional operators produces an oversized condition with the last two options as its branches: is really . This is acknowledged and will probably not change. To avoid this, nested parenthesis are needed, as in this example:
&lt;?php
$arg = &quot;T&quot;;
$vehicle = $arg == &quot;B&quot; ? &quot;bus&quot; :
 ($arg == &quot;A&quot; ? &quot;airplane&quot; :
 ($arg == &quot;T&quot; ? &quot;train&quot; :
 ($arg == &quot;C&quot; ? &quot;car&quot; :
 ($arg == &quot;H&quot; ? &quot;horse&quot; :
 &quot;feet&quot;))));
echo $vehicle;
This will produce the result of train being printed to the output, analogous to a right associative conditional operator.

===Powershell===
In versions before Powershell 7 ternary operators are not supported however conditional syntax does support single line assignment:
$result = if $a -eq $b {&quot;was true&quot; } else {&quot;was false&quot;}
In Powershell 7+ traditional ternary operators are supported and follow the C# syntax:

$result = $a -eq $b ? &quot;was true&quot; : &quot;was false&quot;
===Python===
Though it had been delayed for several years by disagreements over syntax, an operator for a conditional expression in Python was approved as Python Enhancement Proposal 308 and was added to the 2.5 release in September 2006. Python&#x27;s conditional operator differs from the common operator in the order of its operands. The general form is:
result = x if a &gt; b else y
This form invites considering as the normal value and as an exceptional case.

Prior to Python 2.5 there were a number of ways to approximate a conditional operator (for example by indexing into a two element array), all of which have drawbacks as compared to the built-in operator.

===R===
The traditional if-else construct in R (which is an implementation of S) is:
if (a &lt; b) {
 x &lt;- &quot;true&quot;
} else {
 x &lt;- &quot;false&quot;


If there is only one statement in each block, braces can be omitted, like in C:
if (a &lt; b)
 x &lt;- &quot;true&quot;
else
 x &lt;- &quot;false&quot;
The code above can be written in the following non-standard condensed way:
x &lt;- if (a &lt; b) &quot;true&quot; else &quot;false&quot;
There exists also the function that allows rewriting the expression above as:
x &lt;- ifelse(a &lt; b, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;)
The function is automatically vectorized. For instance:
&gt; ifelse(c (0, 2) &lt; 1, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;false&quot;)
[1] &quot;true&quot; &quot;false&quot;
===Raku===
Raku uses a doubled symbol instead of single 
and a doubled symbol instead of 
$result = $a &gt; $b ?? $x !! $y;
===Ruby===
Example of using this operator in Ruby:
1 == 2 ? &quot;true value&quot; : &quot;false value&quot;
Returns &quot;false value&quot;.

A traditional if-else construct in Ruby is written:
if a &gt; b
 result = x
else
 result = y
end
This could also be written as:
result = if a &gt; b
 x
else
 y
end
These can be rewritten as the following statement:
result = a &gt; b ? x : y
===Rust===
Being an expression-oriented programming language, Rust&#x27;s existing codice_7 syntax can behave as the traditional ternary operator does. Earlier versions of the language did have the operator but it was removed due to duplication with .

Note the lack of semi-colons in the code below compared to a more declarative ... block, and the semi-colon at the end of the assignment to .
let x = 5;

let y = if x == 5 {
 10
} else {
 15


This could also be written as:
let y = if x == 5 { 10 } else { 15 };
Note that curly braces are mandatory in Rust conditional expressions.

You could also use a expression:
let y = match x {
 5 =&gt; 10,
 _ =&gt; 15,


===Scheme===
Same as in Common Lisp. Every expression has a value. Thus the builtin can be used:
(let* ((x 5)
 (y (if (= x 5) 10 15)))


===Smalltalk===
Every expression (message send) has a value. Thus can be used:
|x y|

x := 5.
y := (x == 5) ifTrue:[10] ifFalse:[15].
===SQL===
The SQL expression is a generalization of the ternary operator. Instead of one conditional and two results, &quot;n&quot; conditionals and &quot;n+1&quot; results can be specified.

With one conditional it is equivalent (although more verbose) to the ternary operator:
SELECT (CASE WHEN a &gt; b THEN x ELSE y END) AS CONDITIONAL_EXAMPLE
 FROM tab;
This can be expanded to several conditionals:
SELECT (CASE WHEN a &gt; b THEN x WHEN a &lt; b THEN y ELSE z END) AS CONDITIONAL_EXAMPLE
 FROM tab;
====MySQL====
In addition to the standard expression, MySQL provides an function as an extension:
IF(cond, a, b);
====SQL Server====
In addition to the standard expression, SQL Server (from 2012) provides an function:
IIF(condition, true_value, false_value)
====Oracle SQL====
In addition to the standard expression, Oracle has a variadic functional counterpart which operates similarly to a switch statement and can be used to emulate the conditional operator when testing for equality.
-- General syntax takes case-result pairs, comparing against an expression, followed by a fall-back result:
DECODE(expression, case1, result1,
 caseN, resultN,
 resultElse)

-- We can emulate the conditional operator by just selecting one case:
DECODE(expression, condition, true, false)
The function is, today, deprecated in favour of the standard expression. This can be used in both Oracle SQL queries as well as PL/SQL blocks, whereas can only be used in the former.

===Swift===
The &quot;ternary conditional operator&quot; of Swift is written in the usual way of the C tradition, and is used within expressions.
let result = a &gt; b ? a : b
===Tcl===
In Tcl, this operator is available in codice_8 expressions only:
set x 5
set y [expr {$x == 5 ? 10 : 15}]
Outside of codice_8, codice_10 can be used for a similar purpose, as it also returns a value:

package require math

set x 5
set y [if {$x == 5} {
 ::math::random $x
} else {
 ::math::fibonacci $x


===TestStand===
In a National Instruments TestStand expression, if condition is true, the first expression is evaluated and becomes the output of the conditional operation; if false, the second expression is evaluated and becomes the result. Only one of two expressions is ever evaluated.
condition ? first_expression : second_expression
For example:
RunState.Root.Parameters.TestSocket.Index == 3 ? Locals.UUTIndex = 3 : Locals.UUTIndex = 0
Sets the local variable to 3 if is 3, otherwise it sets to 0.

Similar to other languages, first_expression and second_expression do not need to be autonomous expressions, allowing the operator to be used for variable assignment:
Locals.UUTIndex = ( RunState.Root.Parameters.TestSocket.Index == 3 ? 3 : 0 )
===Verilog===
Verilog is technically a hardware description language, not a programming language though the semantics of both are very similar. It uses the syntax for the ternary operator.
// using blocking assignment
wire out;
assign out = sel ? a : b;
This is equivalent to the more verbose Verilog code:
// using blocking assignment
wire out;
if (sel === 1) // sel is 1, not 0, x or z
 assign out = a;
else if (sel === 0) // sel is 0, x or z (1 checked above)
 assign out = b;
else // sel is x or z (0 and 1 checked above)
 assign out = [comment]; // a and b are compared bit by bit, and return for each bit
 // an x if bits are different, and the bit value if the same
===Visual Basic===
Visual Basic doesn&#x27;t use per se, but has a very similar implementation of this shorthand statement. Using the first example provided in this article, it can do:
&#x27; variable = IIf(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)
Dim opening_time As Integer = IIf((day = SUNDAY), 12, 9)
In the above example, is a ternary function, but not a ternary operator. As a function, the values of all three portions are evaluated before the function call occurs. This imposed limitations, and in Visual Basic .Net 9.0, released with Visual Studio 2008, an actual conditional operator was introduced, using the keyword instead of . This allows the following example code to work:
Dim name As String = If(person Is Nothing, &quot;&quot;, person.Name)
Using , would be evaluated even if person is  (Nothing), causing an exception. With a true short-circuiting conditional operator, is not evaluated unless person is not .

Visual Basic Version 9 has added the operator in addition to the existing function that existed previously. As a true operator, it does not have the side effects and potential inefficiencies of the function.

The syntaxes of the tokens are similar: vs . As mentioned above, the function call has significant disadvantages, because the sub-expressions must all be evaluated, according to Visual Basic&#x27;s evaluation strategy for function calls and the result will always be of type variant (VB) or object (VB.NET). The operator however does not suffer from these problems as it supports conditional evaluation and determines the type of the expression based on the types of its operands.

===Zig===
Zig uses &quot;if-else&quot; expressions instead of a ternary conditional operator:

const result = if (a != b) 47 else 3089;
==Result type==
Clearly the type of the result of the operator must be in some sense the type unification of the types of its second and third operands. In C this is accomplished for numeric types by arithmetic promotion; since C does not have a type hierarchy for pointer types, pointer operands may only be used if they are of the same type (ignoring type qualifiers) or one is void or NULL. It is undefined behaviour to mix pointer and integral or incompatible pointer types; thus
number = spell_out_numbers ? &quot;forty-two&quot; : 42;
will result in a compile-time error in most compilers.

==?: in style guidelines==
Conditional operators are widely used and can be useful in certain circumstances to avoid the use of an statement, either because the extra verbiage would be too lengthy or because the syntactic context does not permit a statement. For example:

 #define MAX(a, b) (((a)&gt;(b)) ? (a) : (b))

or
 for (i = 0; i &lt; MAX_PATTERNS; i++)
 c_patterns[i].ShowWindow(m_data.fOn[i] ? SW_SHOW : SW_HIDE);
(The latter example uses the Microsoft Foundation Classes Framework for Win32.)

===Initialization===
An important use of the conditional operator is in allowing a single initialization statement, rather than multiple initialization statements. In many cases this also allows single assignment and for an identifier to be a constant.

The simplest benefit is avoiding duplicating the variable name, as in Python:
x = &#x27;foo&#x27; if b else &#x27;bar&#x27;
instead of:
if b:
 x = &#x27;foo&#x27;
else:
 x = &#x27;bar&#x27;
More importantly, in languages with block scope, such as C++, the blocks of an if/else statement create new scopes, and thus variables must be declared &quot;before&quot; the if/else statement, as:
std::string s;
if (b)
 s = &quot;foo&quot;;
else
 s = &quot;bar&quot;;
Use of the conditional operator simplifies this:
std::string s = b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;;
Furthermore, since initialization is now part of the declaration, rather than a separate statement, the identifier can be a constant (formally, of  type):
const std::string s = b ? &quot;foo&quot; : &quot;bar&quot;;
===Case selectors===
When properly formatted, the conditional operator can be used to write simple and coherent case selectors. For example:
vehicle = arg == &#x27;B&#x27; ? bus :
 arg == &#x27;A&#x27; ? airplane :
 arg == &#x27;T&#x27; ? train :
 arg == &#x27;C&#x27; ? car :
 arg == &#x27;H&#x27; ? horse :
 feet;
Appropriate use of the conditional operator in a variable assignment context reduces the probability of a bug from a faulty assignment as the assigned variable is stated just once as opposed to multiple times.

==Programming languages without the conditional operator==
The following are examples of notable general-purpose programming languages that don&#x27;t provide a conditional operator:

* CoffeeScript
* Go programming language (although provided by 3rd-party libraries)
* MATLAB
* Pascal although Object Pascal / Delphi do have a function to do the same (with caveats)
* Rust The construct is an expression and can be used to get the same functionality.
* Scala
* PowerShell (in old versions) an elegant workaround is to use codice_11

<text>Kariakoo (&quot;Kata ya Kariakoo&quot;, in Swahili) is an administrative ward of the Ilala Municipal Council of the Dar es Salaam Region in Tanzania. Jangwani ward and Mchafukoge ward form the ward&#x27;s northern and eastern boundaries. The Gerezani and Mchikichini wards border the ward to the south and west respectively. The ward is the home of Simba Sports Club. The name is derived from the swahilization of the British colonial occupation&#x27;s &quot;Carrier Corps&quot;, that used to be based in the area. Today, Kariakoo is mainly known for its large market that spans several city blocks. According to the 2022 census, the ward has a population of 10,246.

==Administration==
The postal code for the Kariakoo ward is &quot;11106&quot;. 
The ward is divided into the following neighborhoods (&quot;Mitaa&quot;): 
* Kariakoo Kaskazini
* Kariakoo Magharibi

* Kariakoo Mashariki

=== Government ===
The ward, like every other ward in the country, has local government offices based on the population served.The Kariakoo Ward administration building houses a court as per the Ward Tribunal Act of 1988, including other vital departments for the administration the ward. The ward has the following administration offices:

* Kariakoo Ward Police Station located in Karume neighborhood
* Kariakoo Ward Government Office (&quot;Afisa Mtendaji&quot;) in Shariff Shamba Neighborhood
* Kariakoo Ward Tribunal (&quot;Baraza La Kata&quot;) is a Department inside Ward Government Office

In the local government system of Tanzania, the ward is the smallest democratic unit. Each ward is composed of a committee of eight elected council members which include a chairperson, one salaried officer (with no voting rights), and an executive officer. One-third of seats are reserved for women councillors.

==Demographics==
The ward serves as the Zaramo people&#x27;s ancestral home, along with much of the district. As the city developed throughout time, the ward became into a cosmopolitan ward. In total, 13,780 people called the ward home in 2012.

==History==

In pre-colonial times there was a large village in the area now known as Kariakoo. This village was frequently raided by slave traders. In the latter half of the 19th century, the area became a &quot;shamba&quot; (farm) belonging to the Sultan of Zanzibar. During German rule, 200 hectares of the shamba were bought by a German businessman named Schoeller, who rented the land to the Africans. At the same time, Dar es Salaam began to grow, and while Europeans built their houses in exclusive areas such as Oyster Bay, Kariakoo became Dar&#x27;s main African settlement. In 1913, 15.000 out of the total 24.000 African inhabitants of Dar lived in Kariakoo.

In 1914 the German administration bought Kariakoo from Schoeller, with the intent of creating a formal African township according to the general segregationist strategy being applied German East Africa. Concrete houses were built to accommodate the African population, and at that same time the market was established; yet, the advent of First World War delayed its actual opening.

In 1916 the British conquered Dar es Salaam, and Kariakoo was used as a base for the Carrier Corps.In 1923 the market built by the Germans finally began to function. In the 1970s it was substantially restructured.

==Economy==
Kariakoo hosts an extensive market which is a major contribution to Dar es Salaam&#x27;s economy. The market is located on 67 Swahili Street. Kariakoo also hosts the Tanzania Postal Bank on Msimbazi Street. Kariakoo is served by the Kamata Train Station located on Msimbazi Street just outside of the ward.Kariakoo has good transport links due to the Dar es Salaam bus rapid transit service offered just outside of the ward.

==The Kariakoo Market==
It is the busiest and the biggest market that contributes substantially to Dar es Salaam&#x27;s food provision as well as a small-scale economy. Until recently Kariakoo was also one of the main dala dala &quot;stations&quot; in Dar es Salaam, although this has now been moved to south east of Mawasiliano as the Mawasiliano bus terminal. Seeing how well the business is going. The Kariakoo Market Corp are soon set to open another new market at Mbezi Beach area at the cost of Sh500m.

== Education and health==
===Education===
The ward is home to these educational institutions 
* Mamilo Vocational College

===Healthcare===
The ward is home to the following health institutions:
* Kariakoo Dispensary
* Health Home Dispensary
* Sokoni Dispensary
* Kings Health Center, Kariakoo
* Kariakoo Hospital

<doc id="667451" wikidata="Q7821548" url="?curid=667451" title="Tonks–Girardeau gas">
<text>In physics, a Tonks–Girardeau gas is a Bose gas in which the repulsive interactions between bosonic particles confined to one dimension dominate the system&#x27;s physics. It is named after physicists Lewi Tonks, who developed a classical model in 1936, and Marvin D. Girardeau who generalized it to the quantum regime. It is not a Bose–Einstein condensate as it does not demonstrate any of the necessary characteristics, such as off-diagonal long-range order or a unitary two-body correlation function, even in a thermodynamic limit and as such cannot be described by a macroscopically occupied orbital (order parameter) in the Gross–Pitaevskii formulation.

The Tonks–Girardeau gas is a particular case of the Lieb–Liniger model.

==Definition==
A row of bosons all confined to a one-dimensional line cannot pass each other and therefore cannot exchange places. The resulting motion has been compared to a traffic jam: the motion of each boson is strongly correlated with that of its two neighbors. This can be thought of as the large-&quot;c&quot; limit of the delta Bose gas.

Because the particles cannot exchange places, their behavior might be expected to be fermionic, but their behavior differs from that of fermions in several important ways: the particles can all occupy the same momentum state, which corresponds to neither Bose-Einstein nor Fermi–Dirac statistics. This is the phenomenon of bosonization which happens in 1+1 dimensions.

In the case of a Tonks–Girardeau gas (TG), so many properties of this one-dimensional string of bosons would be sufficiently fermion-like that the situation is often referred to as the &#x27;fermionization&#x27; of bosons. Tonks–Girardeau gas matches quantum Nonlinear Schrödinger equation for infinite repulsion, which can be efficiently analyzed by quantum inverse scattering method. This relation helps to study correlation functions. The correlation functions can be described by an Integrable system. In a simple case, it is a Painlevé transcendent. The quantum correlation functions of a Tonks–Girardeau gas can be described by means of classical, completely integrable, differential equations. Thermodynamics of Tonks–Girardeau gas was described by Chen Ning Yang.

==Physical realization==

The first example of TGs came in 2004 when Paredes and coworkers created an array of such gases using an optical lattice. In a different experiment, Kinoshita and coworkers observed a strongly correlated 1D Tonks–Girardeau gas.

The optical lattice is formed by six intersecting laser beams, which generate an interference pattern. The beams are arranged as standing waves along three orthogonal directions. This results in an array of optical dipole traps where atoms are stored in the intensity maxima of the interference pattern.

The researchers loaded ultracold rubidium atoms into one-dimensional tubes formed by a two-dimensional lattice (the third standing wave is initially off). This lattice is strong so that the atoms have insufficient energy to tunnel between neighboring tubes. The interaction is too low for the transition to the TG regime. For that, the third axis of the lattice is used. It is set to a lower intensity and shorter time than the other two, so that tunneling in this direction is possible. For increasing intensity of the third lattice, atoms in the same lattice well are more and more tightly trapped, which increases the collisional energy. When the collisional energy becomes much bigger than the tunneling energy, the atoms can still tunnel into empty lattice wells, but not into or across occupied ones.

This technique has been used by other researchers to obtain an array of one-dimensional Bose gases in the Tonks-Girardeau regime. However, the fact that an array of gases is observed only allows the measurement of averaged quantities. Moreover, the temperatures and chemical potential between the different tubes are dispersed, which wash out many effects. For instance, this configuration does not allow probing of system fluctuations. Thus it proved interesting to produce a single Tonks–Girardeau gas. In 2011 one team created a single one-dimensional TG gas by trapping rubidium atoms magnetically in the vicinity of a microstructure. Thibaut Jacqmin &quot;et al.&quot; measured density fluctuations in that single strongly interacting gas. Those fluctuations proved to be sub-Poissonian, as expected for a Fermi gas.

<text>Acceptance in psychology is a person&#x27;s recognition and assent to the finality of a situation without attempting to change or protest it. This plays out at both the individual and societal level as people experience change. 

== Types of acceptance ==
The term &quot;acceptance&quot; is a noun with various meanings. 

=== Self-acceptance ===

Self-acceptance is described as the state or ongoing process of striving to be satisfied with one&#x27;s current self. It is an agreement with oneself to appreciate, validate, and support the self as it is, despite deficiencies and negative past behavior. 

Some have trouble accepting themselves because of guilt, trauma, or a perceived lack of motivation. Self-acceptance has an effect on a person mentally, emotionally, within relationships and overall life. 

=== Psychological acceptance ===

Acceptance is a core element of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In this context, acceptance is a process that involves actively contacting psychological internal experiences (emotions, sensations, urges, flashbacks, and other private events) directly, fully, without reacting or becoming defensive. The idea is to accept the things one cannot change, such as psychological experiences, but build the courage to change the things one can.

=== Social acceptance ===

Social acceptance, according to &quot;APA Dictionary of Psychology,&quot; means being included in a group, either formally or informally, and not being judged or disapproved of by others. It’s about how much people want to spend time with someone in both public and private situations. In other words, social acceptance is about fitting in with those around you, like classmates, coworkers, or friends. It shows whether people include you and don’t criticize or reject you.

Social acceptance can be defined as tolerating and welcoming the differences and diversity in others because most people attempt to look and act like others do in order to fit in. Data shows that those with high self-acceptance scores tend to accept others and feel accepted by others. This concern is heightened for children and teenagers who tend to desire being accepted by friends. 

When it comes to mental disorders, social acceptance plays a big role in recovery. Many people do not understand mental illness, so they are unsure of how to embrace people who have a disease, leaving these people with feelings of isolation in friend groups. Being accepted by a friend and having support can help with mental health and give a healthy sense of self.

=== Public acceptance ===
Public acceptance is stated as a &quot;general agreement that something is satisfactory or right, or that someone should be included in a group.&quot; 

An example of public acceptance would be the LGBTQ+ community. It is a very important aspect to the movement because it involves understanding, and inclusion of many individuals with different gender identities, and sexual orientation within the public and society in general. 

=== Cultural acceptance ===
Cultural acceptance means respecting people for who they are without judging their culture, traditions, clothing, or appearance. It is the ability to accept the individual for their cultural beliefs and their principles. It&#x27;s about understanding and valuing what makes someone unique and treating them with kindness and respect.

=== Parental acceptance ===
Parental acceptance is described as the affection, nurturance, support or simply the love a parent has for that child and the experience the children can gain from it.

===Conditional acceptance===
A type of acceptance that requires modification of the initial conditions before the final acceptance is made, is called conditional acceptance, or qualified acceptance. For instance, in a contract involving two parties, adjustments or modifications may be made to ensure it aligns with the satisfaction of both parties. When a person receives an offer and is willing to agree to it, provided that certain changes are made to its terms or certain conditions or events occur, it is referred to as conditional acceptance. In a business contract between a company and an employer, both parties have the option to change and modify the terms until mutual agreement or acceptance of the contract&#x27;s details is reached.

===Expressed acceptance===

Expressed acceptance involves making an and unambiguous acceptance of the set conditions. For example, a person clearly and explicitly agrees to an offer. They accept the terms without any changes.

===Implied acceptance===

Implied acceptance refers to a situation where one&#x27;s intent to consent to the presented conditions is understood or inferred, even if not explicitly stated. Acceptance is implied by an act that indicates a person&#x27;s assent to the proposed bargain.

<text>Cochin International Airport — popularly known as Kochi International Airport or Nedumbassery Airport — is an international airport serving the city of Kochi, Kerala, in southwestern India. It is located at Nedumbassery, about northeast of the city center. The airport is the first of its kind to be developed under a public-private partnership (PPP) model in India. This project was funded by nearly 10,000 non-resident Indians from 32 countries. It is the busiest and largest airport in the state of Kerala. , the airport caters to more than 63% of the total air passenger traffic in Kerala. It is the fifth-busiest airport in India in terms of international traffic, and the eighth-busiest overall.

In fiscal year 2023–2024, the airport handled more than 10.3 million passengers with a total of 67,469 aircraft movements. As of 2024, the airport is served by over 25 airline companies, carrying passengers to 31 international destinations and 22 domestic destinations.

The airport operates three passenger terminals and one cargo terminal with a total area of over . In 2015, the airport became the world&#x27;s first fully solar-powered airport with the inauguration of a dedicated solar plant. For this entrepreneurial vision, the airport won the coveted Champion of the Earth award in 2018, the highest environmental honour instituted by the United Nations. The airport was awarded The Best Airport in Asia-Pacific in 2020 (5 to 15 million passengers per year) by Airports Council International.

==History==
Kochi&#x27;s airport began as an airstrip on Willingdon Island, built in 1936 by the Kingdom of Cochin, intended for transporting officials involved in the development of the Cochin Port. The Kingdom of Cochin allowed the British, who ruled India at the time, to convert the airstrip into a military airport for use by the Indian Navy during World War II. The Royal Navy chose it as a strategic site for their headquarters in Southern India and as an air station cum landing craft and seaplane base. The military facility hosted naval fighter planes and was intended to thwart possible Japanese air raids. A small naval unit set up operations just two days before the outbreak of World War II.

After India achieved dominion status and the merger of the Kingdom of Cochin with India, the Indian Navy operated the airport, though it permitted civilian aircraft to use the facility. The Gulf economic boom of the 1980s made it necessary to develop international connections to Kochi in the interests of expatriates working in the Middle East.

==Construction==
The original proposal for the airport outlined an estimated cost of and an expected date of commission in 1997. Approval was granted in May 1993. The funding was envisaged to be from interest-free loans from non-resident Indians working abroad, donations from industrial undertakings, exporters, cooperative societies and loans from the state government. A body called the Cochin International Airport Society, under the chairmanship of the Chief Minister of Kerala K. Karunakaran, was registered in July 1993 to execute the project. To better fund mobilisation, as well as an administrative convenience, a public limited company under the name Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) was registered in March 1994 with an authorised capital of .

In 1996, E. K. Nayanar took over as chairman of the CIAL project. The construction picked up momentum during this period and Nayanar ensured that the airport project received special attention from the State Government and gave his unstinted support to CIAL. By 1997, substantial land was taken into CIAL possession through negotiated settlements. A total of of land was acquired for the construction of the airport. Approximately 2,300 landowners and 872 families were resettled under a rehabilitation package. Major electric lines and an irrigation canal had to be diverted. The facility was formally inaugurated by the then President of India, K. R. Narayanan on 25 May 1999 and the first commercial service began on 10 June 1999. The operations from the old naval airport were moved to CIAL on 1 July 1999.

===Expansion===

====Phase 1====
The airport had of floor space at its inauguration. CIAL envisioned four phases of expansion over 20 years, the third phase of which was completed in 2009. The original airport terminal was envisioned to handle just 100 passengers at a time. However, by 2001, the international passenger traffic was growing, making it necessary to redevelop the terminal.

In 2002, the floor area for the international operations of the original building rose due to the completion of a separate domestic terminal, shifting all domestic operations there.

====Phase 2====

With a rising number of airlines operating at the airport, CIAL decided to construct an exclusive terminal for domestic operations, namely Terminal 2, making the international one Terminal 1, increasing the floor space for international operations by . As part of the second phase of the expansion plans, an airline center complex of was constructed on the western side of the terminal to accommodate the airline and CIAL&#x27;s administrative offices. The cargo terminal was also expanded in the second phase.

====Phase 3====
Work on the third phase was intended to accommodate 5 million passenger movements annually and was started in 2007. The third phase involved the commissioning of a central block, connecting the domestic and international terminals and enlarging the airside area to accommodate more gates and waiting areas along with increased shopping areas. This increased the built-up area by another . The airside area of the international arrivals and departures blocks were integrated and glass walls were installed to allow for more natural light. The runway was re-surfaced in 2008. The number of parking areas was increased from 15 to 24, including three dedicated for cargo airlines. The third phase also completed the expansion of the cargo village and a second aircraft taxiway to the MRO facility.

====Phase 4====
The fourth phase of expansion was originally planned to upgrade the domestic terminal, which has remained untouched in the past three phases. However, the expansion plans were changed after the new UDF government took over the administration of the state in May 2011.

As per the revised plans, the international terminal is to face a major renovation before being converted completely into a domestic terminal, while a new state-of-the-art international terminal is coming up. As per the new plans announced by the board of directors in September 2011, the new international terminal would come up on the eastern side of the existing structure. The built-up space of the new terminal would be having segregated departures and arrivals at different levels. The new terminal with an elevation featuring Kerala temple architecture will have all the latest features of international standards. Construction major Larsen &amp; Toubro is building the facility which will be ready within 30 months. The two-level terminal will have provisions for 112 check-in counters, with in-line baggage screening facilities, 100 immigration counters, of duty-free shops at departure and arrival lounges, 19 boarding gates, 15 aerobridges, six baggage conveyor belts and fully covered alighting and boarding area.

The current domestic terminal would be converted into an &quot;Executive Pavilion&quot; and would handle VIP and private chartered flights and jets. The current international terminal once converted into a domestic terminal, will have 5 aerobridges and 10 boarding gates, apart from increased parking bays.

==Management==
Cochin International Airport is the first in India to be built by a public-private partnership and is owned by a public limited company called Cochin International Airport Limited, better known as CIAL, created by the Government of Kerala in 1994. The Government of Kerala holds a 33.36% stake, making it the single largest investor in the project. Indian government companies like Air India, BPCL and AAI hold an 8.74% stake, while foreign companies like Abu Dhabi based Emke Group, the Oman-based Galfar Group, UAE based Majeed Bukatara Trading holds a 5.42% stake. Indian companies hold 8.57% stake, while scheduled commercial banks like Federal Bank, SBT and Canara Bank holds 5.91%. The remaining 38.03% stake is held by more than 10,000 personal investors from 29 countries, mostly non-resident Indians.

The company has decided to go for a public offering and give 10 million shares to HUDCO as part of a debt settlement, which would to lead HUDCO having a 3.37% stake in the company and a reduction of the stake of other holders.

The Chief Minister of Kerala is the ex-officio chairman of CIAL.

==Security==
Cochin International Airport is listed among the 12 major airports of India. Its safety and security is handled by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security through the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF). Cochin was the third international airport and the first private airport in the country to come under the cover of CISF in 2001, after the Government of India decided to hand over airport security to CISF in the wake of the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814. Security was handled by the Kerala Police; Special Branch of Kochi Police before the CISF. The airport company&#x27;s Aviation Safety Wing (ASW) oversees security facilities and equipment. The ASW is also responsible for fire and emergency services.

Security management training is provided by CIAL&#x27;s Aviation Academy and personnel are employed by the company as security agents – deployed in baggage screening rooms, entry gates, the general cargo area and the lounge areas. CIAL ASW employs Army-trained sniffer dogs to check for explosives in baggage areas, the only Indian airport to have such a facility. CIAL has introduced three state-of-the-art ION scanning detectors that can identify small amounts of material, down to nanograms, of explosives.

The airport is under the direct protection of the Kochi City Police, who have a station outside the terminal. CISF maintains two armed squadrons and one bomb detection and disposal squad. CISF has a command center 250metres outside the terminal, with an intelligence division and mobilisation cell. The air customs division operates a narcotics detection squad in the terminal. The CIAL ASWs are working on installing a fully automated perimeter intrusion detection system that will detect any possible violation, using sensors that will provide critical time for the security forces to react. Phase one of the intrusion prevention system is in place with barricades, automatic retractable bollards, surveillance cameras, parking gate management systems and the introduction of biometric ID cards for staff.

The immigration department is handled by Kerala Police, Special Branch officials trained by the Bureau of Immigration.

The airport company also has a high-end robotic security system capable of remote-handling of explosive devices and fire-fighting and hostage situations. The system is operational from September 2014, making CIAL the first in South India to have such a facility. It comprises safety robots developed by Canada-based Pedsco Ltd. and Threat Containment Vessel (TCV) and sophisticated luggage containment vehicle – both developed by Nabco, USA. The main equipment of the system is a threat containment vessel (TCV) carried by robots, which is capable of containing a blast of minimum 8 kg of TNT or equivalent quantity of explosive, triggered by suspected luggage including chemicals, radioactive materials and bombs. The container is reusable as it withstands repeated detonations and size of the TCV can be adjusted with the size of the suspected baggage. In addition to TCV, the technology also comprises a remote mobile Investigator (RMI)-9WT, which is a multipurpose six-wheel vehicle with removable tracks for step climbing capability. Using fixed arm extenders, the robot can be configured for different applications such as under car searches and second-store window access.

==Education and training==
Since 2008, CIAL has been the first airport to venture into providing higher education in aviation management and technical areas to overcome the shortage of skilled manpower in the aviation industry. CIAL has teamed up with the Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) to start two schools in aviation education.

CIAL Aviation Academy provides two-year management degrees in aviation and airport management, operations, economics, finance and human resources, along with short-term aviation oriented vocational diplomas. The academy also trains technical manpower required for airport operations. Air India Express has its temporary stewards grooming and training center in the facility.

Aviation Security Training Institute – The Aviation Security Training Institute (ASTI), envisioned by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security has been inaugurated in February 2014. The institute has state-of-the-art facilities like X-ray simulators (21), explosive model room, two classrooms with LCD projectors and other training infrastructures. Explosive model rooms display different types of switch mechanism to trigger explosion. Library consists of CDs, catering to International Civil Aviation With the establishment of ASTI in Kochi, employees and management personnel from Mangalore, Kozhikode, Coimbatore, Trichy, Madurai and Thiruvananthapuram airports can take training here. Employees of the proposed Kannur international airport are also likely to be trained here.

==Ground transportation==
CIAL is located between National Highway 544 (NH 544), one of the main highways of South India, and the Main Central Road (MC Road), one of the state highways of Kerala. An expressway is planned from NH 49 to the MC Road to facilitate faster transport. Though the main railway line is only about 500 meters from the airport, the nearest station is Angamaly about  5 km away. A railway station with two platforms each capable of accommodating trains with up to 24 coaches, has been proposed to be built near the Airport at a cost of about ₹19 Crores. From the proposed station, travellers can reach the airport by taking a 1.5-kilometre road that passes beneath the Railway Over Bridge. Cochin International Airport Limited is also willing to operate electric buses connecting the new railway station and the airport. The proposed name for the station is `Cochin Airport.&#x27; 

=== Air-taxi services ===
Cochin airport has dedicated air-taxi services for passengers to travel to major pilgrim destinations in Kerala as well as to cities like Thiruvananthapuram and in northern Kerala like Kozhikode. In association with Bharat Airways, it provides scheduled air-taxi services to Sabarimala.

==CIAL Aerotropolis==
One of the main projects for the future of the airport was the CIAL Aerotropolis, or Airport City, with a total area of . The Aerotropolis was proposed by its founder, V.J. Kurien, to ensure additional revenue sources for the growth of the company and to increase airport traffic through tourism and allied activities. The Aerotropolis first began in Nedumbassery and nearby villages, aimed to convert into a self-sustainable town, with the airport forming the core element with a residential zone. Work on the Aerotropolis commenced in 2007, and most of the aerotropolis has been completed, as of 2023.

===Manufacturing and business zone===
The master plan envisages the creation of a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for aircraft-allied industries, especially spare parts and OEM manufacturing units, an airline research and development center, workshops and service zones. In addition to this an Information Technology Park, with dedicated airline support technology, design and development centers is also proposed. An integrated logistics center and central container freight station are planned at the cargo village.

CIAL&#x27;s proposal for establishing the SEZ was approved by the Board of Approval of SEZs in 2008; however, work is yet to start due to the global recession. The project is estimated was started in August 2011, and some parts are completed, as of 2023.

===CIAL solar power project===
The CIAL Solar Power Project is a 15 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic (PV) power station built by CIAL. Cochin International Airport became the first fully solar-powered airport in the world with the commissioning of the plant.

The plant comprises 46,150 solar panels laid across near the international cargo complex, and was installed by the German-based Bosch. It is capable of generating 50,000 units of electricity daily, and is equipped with a supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA), through which remote monitoring is carried out. The project components include PV modules of 265 watt-peak (Wp) capacity manufactured by Renesola, and inverters of 1 MW capacity manufactured by ABB India.

The plant is coupled with a 1.1 MW solar plant that was commissioned in 2013, the first megawatt scale installation of a solar PV system in Kerala. This plant was installed by Emvee Photovoltaic Power Pvt. Ltd., consisting of 4,000 monocrystalline modules of 250 Wp and 33 string inverters of 30 kW capacity each.

CIAL has doubled solar production to 28.8 MW of power production within 2 years as part an ambitious plan to expand solar power, with three major projects under construction. The first came up over a canal close to the airport, the second was through development of India&#x27;s first solar carport roof utility plan and the third will use ground level panels on open space near the airport.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 30 July 1998, Indian Airlines Flight 503, a Dornier 228 from Agathi, crashed into a building after takeoff, killing all six people on board and three more people in the building.
* On 25 April 2010, Emirates Flight EK 530, a Boeing 777-200 from Dubai, dropped around during heavy turbulence as the aircraft entered a thick cumulonimbus cloud while on its descent. 20 passengers were injured and some internal damage was caused to the plane. The aircraft was on descent into Kochi when the incident occurred. There were 350 passengers and 14 crew on board.
* On 29 August 2011, Gulf Air Flight GF 270, an Airbus A320 from Bahrain, carrying 137 passengers skidded off the runway at 3:55 am during its descent. The reason for the crash is suspected to be the heavy rain at the time. The aircraft had been said to have slipped off the runway and landed nose first. The aircraft broke one of its wings while landing and stalled air traffic for hours. Passengers after the crash, in chaos, were reported to have jumped from the aircraft through emergency exit doors even before stairways were brought into place. The crash caused seven minor injuries and two serious injuries due to the chaos that followed.
* On 4 September 2017, Air India Express Flight IX 452, a Boeing 737-800 which arrived from Abu Dhabi, got stuck in the drain canal while taxiing to the international terminal 3 after landing. Passengers and crew were safely evacuated. The incident happened when the pilot took a wrong turn from the parallel taxiway, almost 90 meters before the link taxiway through which the aircraft was supposed to vacate.

===2018 Kerala floods===

The runway and other facilities were non-functional due to excessive flooding and inclement weather. Flights to Kochi were diverted to and were operating from other airports in the state like Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. From 20 August 2018, INS Garuda (a naval airbase in Kochi) was used as a civilian airport for small aircraft operations to neighbouring cities like Bangalore, Chennai, and Coimbatore. The airport reopened on 29 August 2018, 14:00 Indian Standard Time (UTC+05:30). It suffered an estimated loss of during the closed period.

===2019 Kerala floods===

<text>The United Golfers Association (UGA) was a group of African-American professional golfers who operated a separate series of professional golf tournaments for Blacks during the era of racial segregation in the United States. It was said to have started in 1925 when George Adams became a founding member and in 1926 by Robert Hawkins, a golfer from Massachusetts. It was known affectionately as the Chitlin Circuit and included many talented golfers such as Ted Rhodes, Bill Spiller, Pete Brown, Lee Elder, Willie Brown Jr., Zeke Hartsfield, Howard Wheeler, and Charlie Sifford.

Women were allowed to participate from the group&#x27;s inception, but only in 1939 did the first women&#x27;s golfing organization seek affiliation when the Chicago Women&#x27;s Golf Club, organized by Anna Robinson, applied to join. Also, the Wake-Robin Golf Club, whose first president was Helen Webb Harris, joined the UGA under her leadership.

Jimmy Taylor added the Mid Winter Classic at Rogers Park, Tampa to the circuit in 1963.

From 1934 through November 1961, the Professional Golfers Association of America maintained a &quot;Caucasian-only&quot; membership clause in its bylaws. The clause was removed by amending its constitution. 

Contemporary golf associations for African Americans include the African American Golf Association (AAGA), United States Black Golf Association, United Black Golfers Association (UBGA), Western States Golf Association, Bogey Boyz, Black Jewels Ladies Golf Association and the African American Golf Foundation, Inc.

<text>Carrier onboard delivery (COD) is the use of aircraft to ferry personnel, mail, supplies, and high-priority cargo, such as replacement parts, from shore bases to an aircraft carrier at sea. Several types of aircraft, including helicopters, have been used by navies in the COD role. The Grumman C-2 Greyhound has been the United States Navy&#x27;s primary COD aircraft since the mid-1960s.

==History==


Early United States Navy (USN) recognition of need for a cargo plane capable of carrier landings resulted in airframe conversion of Grumman TBM-3 Avenger torpedo bombers to unarmed seven-passenger COD aircraft designated TBM-3R. Replacement of TBM-3Rs began in the late 1950s. Grumman built a cargo variant of its twin-piston-engined Grumman S-2 Tracker anti-submarine warfare bomber as the C-1A Trader. (Contrary to popular belief, C-130 Hercules was not tested for COD.) In the late 1960s Grumman began production of a cargo variant of its twin-turboprop E-2 Hawkeye Airborne Early Warning aircraft known as the C-2A Greyhound. Five Lockheed US-3A Viking aircraft were also used from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s. The C-2 has remained the U.S. Navy&#x27;s primary COD vehicle since that time.

Several U.S. Navy &quot;Fleet Logistics Support Squadrons&quot; provided COD services aboard carriers since the World War II, including VR-5, VR-21, VR-22, VR-23, VR-24, VRC-30, VRC-40, and VRC-50. 
On 6 October 2012, a MV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft from squadron VMM-165 landed and refueled on board . This operation was part of an evaluation of the feasibility of the MV-22 as a potential replacement for the current C-2 cargo transport aircraft. Further cargo handling trials took place in 2013 on .

In April 2014 Lockheed Martin announced that they would offer refurbished and remanufactured Lockheed S-3 Vikings as a replacement for the decades-old Northrop Grumman C-2A Greyhound on-board carrier delivery aircraft. Dubbed the C-3, the aircraft would have a wider fuselage, but would retain the original wings, tail assembly, engines and crew compartment. With an unrefueled range of carrying a load, Lockheed stated that the C-3 would have twice the range of a new C-2, and triple the range of a V-22 Osprey. Unlike other competitors, the C-3 could meet the critical requirement to transport replacement Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engines for the F-35. The requirement for 35 aircraft would be met from the 91 S-3s currently in storage. In 2015, the Navy published a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for using 4 to 12 HV-22s as COD. On 3 February 2016, the future COD version was designated as the CMV-22B.

==List of COD aircraft==

<doc id="667474" wikidata="Q1232443" url="?curid=667474" title="Martin Gélinas">
<text>Martin Gélinas (; born June 5, 1970) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward who played 1,273 games in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Edmonton Oilers, Quebec Nordiques, Vancouver Canucks, Carolina Hurricanes, Calgary Flames, Florida Panthers and Nashville Predators. A first-round selection of the Los Angeles Kings at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, Gélinas was sent to the Oilers as part of the 1988 Wayne Gretzky trade before ever playing a game for the Kings.

Gélinas reached the Stanley Cup Finals with four teams. He was a member of Edmonton&#x27;s 1990 championship team and also reached the Finals in 1994 with Vancouver, 2002 with Carolina and 2004 with Calgary. He tied a record in 2004 by scoring three series-winning goals in one playoff year, earning him the nickname &quot;The Eliminator&quot;. After playing his final professional season with SC Bern in the Swiss National League A (NLA), Gélinas turned to coaching and player development. He was named an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames in 2012.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
Gélinas played two seasons of junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) for the Hull Olympiques between 1987 and 1989. He scored 101 goals and 107 assists in 106 games. In his first year, 1987–88, Gélinas finished 10th in QMJHL scoring with 131 points. He won the Michel Bergeron Trophy as offensive rookie of the year and was named Canadian Hockey League rookie of the year in addition to being named a QMJHL first-team all-star. Gélinas added 32 points in 17 playoff games as the Olympiques defeated the Drummondville Voltigeurs in the final to win the President&#x27;s Cup. At the 1988 Memorial Cup, Gélinas won the George Parsons Trophy as the most sportsmanlike player of the tournament.

The National Hockey League (NHL) Central Scouting Bureau ranked Gélinas as the eighth best prospect at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft. He was selected by the Los Angeles Kings with the seventh overall pick. Gélinas never played for the Kings as on August 9, 1988, he was included in one of the most significant trades in NHL history. The Edmonton Oilers sent Wayne Gretzky, Mike Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley to the Kings in exchange for Gélinas, Jimmy Carson, three first round draft picks and $15 million in cash.

As one of the key players coming to Edmonton in what he later called &quot;the biggest trade in sports history&quot;, Gélinas endured the scrutiny of the Canadian media and pressure created by angry and disappointed fans after the Oilers dealt away a player in Gretzky who was considered a national icon. Gélinas began the 1988–89 season with the Oilers and made his NHL debut and scored his first point, on an assist, on October 7, 1988, against the New York Islanders. He scored his first goal ten days later against Jon Casey of the Minnesota North Stars but he was returned to Hull after six games to complete his second season of junior hockey. Making his international debut, Gélinas played with the Canadian national junior team at the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. He recorded two assists in seven games for the fourth place Canadians.

===Edmonton, Quebec, Vancouver and Carolina===
Joining the Oilers full-time in 1989–90, Gélinas recorded 25 points in 46 games. At the age of 19, he was a member of Edmonton&#x27;s &quot;Kid Line&quot; playing alongside 22-year-olds Joe Murphy and Adam Graves. The trio provided an offensive boost in the post-season as the Oilers reached the 1990 Stanley Cup Finals against the Boston Bruins. Edmonton won the best-of-seven championship series four games to one and captured the Stanley Cup. After recording 40 points in 1990–91, Gélinas scored only 29 points the following season. The Quebec Nordiques, who had been criticized by local fans and media for failing to select Gélinas at the 1988 draft, attempted to acquire him in exchange for Bryan Fogarty. The deal failed to materialize and Gélinas remained with the Oilers for the 1992–93 season where his offensive production again declined, to 23 points.

The Nordiques finally acquired Gélinas on June 20, 1993, in exchange for Scott Pearson. He lasted only 31 games with Quebec before being placed on waivers and claimed by the Vancouver Canucks. After scoring 16 points in 33 games to end the 1993–94 regular season with Vancouver, Gélinas added nine points in 24 playoff games. The Canucks reached the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals but were defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, he scored 23 points in 46 games and won his first of two consecutive Fred J. Hume Awards as Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;unsung hero&quot;. Gélinas finally achieved the offensive production expected of him when he was drafted by recording consecutive 30-goal seasons. He scored 30 goals in 1995–96 and led the Canucks with 35 goals, was second to Alexander Mogilny with 68 points and recorded a four-goal game against the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996–97. He won three team awards: The Cyclone Taylor Award as Vancouver&#x27;s most valuable player, the Molson Cup for earning the most three star selections and the Most Exciting Player Award.

A collision with Edmonton&#x27;s Dan McGillis early in the 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina&#x27;s roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team at both ends of the ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.
Placed in a defensive role, Gélinas&#x27;s offensive statistics fell to 28 points in 1998–99 and 30 in 1999–2000. The Hurricanes placed him on waivers late in the latter season, but remained with the team after he went unclaimed. His teammates expressed relief that he hadn&#x27;t been moved the following season as, after improving to 59 points, Gélinas scored the game-winning goal to clinch a playoff spot for Carolina. He recorded only one assist in six post-season games, then accepted a lessened role with the Hurricanes as he was placed on the third line in 2001–02. Gélinas led the Hurricanes to their first Stanley Cup Finals in franchise history after scoring the overtime-winning goal in the sixth game of the Eastern Conference final to eliminate the Toronto Maple Leafs. Carolina fell to the Detroit Red Wings in five games in the 2002 Stanley Cup Finals.

===Calgary, Florida and Nashville===
Gélinas chose to decline his contract option for 2002–03 and left Carolina as a free agent. He signed a contract with the Calgary Flames on July 2, 2002. A 52-point season was fourth best on the Flames and included his 500th career point, a game-winning goal against the Detroit Red Wings on January 25, 2003. Gélinas reached another career milestone during the 2003–04 season as he played in his 1,000th NHL game on December 9 against the Minnesota Wild. His 35 points on the season was again fourth-best on the team.

In qualifying for the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs, the Flames reached the post-season for the first time in eight seasons. With eight goals and 15 points in the playoffs, Gélinas emerged as one of Calgary&#x27;s post-season heroes. He scored the series-winning goal in overtime of game seven of the Flames&#x27; first round series against Vancouver. The victory advanced Calgary to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in 15 years. Gélinas also scored the overtime goal that eliminated Detroit in six games, which made him the first player in NHL history to score three series-winning goals in overtime. He then became the second player in NHL history to score three series-clinching goals in one playoff year by tallying the goal that eliminated the San Jose Sharks and propelled the Flames into the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals. His heroics throughout the post-season resulted in Gélinas being called &quot;the Eliminator&quot;.

The Flames&#x27; Cinderella run ended in the Cup Finals as the Tampa Bay Lightning won the series in seven games. The result was controversial as Gélinas appeared to have scored the tie-breaking goal in the sixth game that would have won the Stanley Cup for Calgary had the score held up. Television replays of the play showed that the puck deflected off Gélinas&#x27; skate and appeared to be across the goal line before Tampa goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin kicked it out of the net. The referees did not signal a goal, however, and no video review was requested. Tampa Bay went on to win the game in overtime.

As the 2004–05 NHL season went unplayed due to a labour dispute, Gélinas spent the season in Switzerland. He played one regular season and five playoff games with HC Lugano in the Nationalliga A (NLA), but otherwise spent the season with HC Forward-Morges in the Nationalliga B (NLB) where he scored 37 goals in 41 games and recorded 58 points. A free agent when the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, Gélinas signed a two-year contract with the Florida Panthers. Brought in as a capable veteran, he played all 82 games for Florida and scored over 40 points in each season. Gélinas scored his 300th career goal in Florida&#x27;s final game of the 2006–07 season.

Leaving Florida, Gélinas signed with the Nashville Predators for the 2007–08 season. He had 20 points in 57 games before suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament on February 21, 2008, game against the Vancouver Canucks that was ultimately his final contest in the NHL. Gélinas returned to Switzerland 2008–09 as he signed a contract to play with SC Bern in the NLA. In 27 games, he scored 15 goals and 22 points. He retired following the season. In his NHL career, Gélinas played 1,273 regular season games and added 147 in the playoffs. His former junior team, now known as the Gatineau Olympiques, retired his uniform number 20 in 2012.

==Coaching career==
The Nashville Predators hired Gélinas as their director of player development in 2009. He had spent the final years of his playing career mentoring younger teammates, and Predators general manager David Poile praised him as being an ideal person for the role: &quot;we will depend on Martin and his experience, work ethic and professionalism to help develop our prospects into NHL players&quot;. Spending up to 20 days per month on the road, he often served in a coaching capacity by assisting players during practices when visiting Nashville&#x27;s farm club, the Milwaukee Admirals. He carried that experience back to Calgary in 2012 when he was hired as the Flames&#x27; assistant coach under Bob Hartley. One of Gélinas&#x27; duties with the team is to work with the special teams units, both the power play and the penalty kill.

==Personal life==
A native of Shawinigan-Sud, Quebec, Gélinas is the son of René Gélinas and Lise Lebel. His father was a barber in Shawinigan-Sud. As a youth, Gélinas played in the 1983 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Shawinigan Cats minor ice hockey team.

Gélinas and his wife Jane have three children: son Matthew and daughters Cameron and Morgan. The family have made Calgary their permanent home since he first signed with the Flames in 2002. Mathew is also a hockey player, and in 2013–14 is in junior as a member of the Tri-City Americans.

Active with charitable endeavours throughout his career, Gélinas was named the recipient of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 2004. A Calgary Flames team award, it is given to the player who best combines on-ice leadership with a dedication to community service. He is involved with the Calgary Flames Alumni Association&#x27;s charitable events. Gélinas is also involved with Calgary&#x27;s business industry, holding an interest in Calgary-based Whitecap Resources.

<text>In probability theory, Buffon&#x27;s needle problem is a question first posed in the 18th century by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon:

:Suppose we have a floor made of parallel strips of wood, each the same width, and we drop a needle onto the floor. What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two strips?

Buffon&#x27;s needle was the earliest problem in geometric probability to be solved; it can be solved using integral geometry. The solution for the sought probability , in the case where the needle length is not greater than the width of the strips, is

:formula_1

This can be used to design a Monte Carlo method for approximating the number , although that was not the original motivation for de Buffon&#x27;s question. The seemingly unusual appearance of  in this expression occurs because the underlying probability distribution function for the needle orientation is rotationally symmetric.

== Solution ==
The problem in more mathematical terms is: Given a needle of length dropped on a plane ruled with parallel lines units apart, what is the probability that the needle will lie across a line upon landing?

Let be the distance from the center of the needle to the closest parallel line, and let be the acute angle between the needle and one of the parallel lines.

The uniform probability density function (PDF) of between 0 and is
:formula_2

Here, represents a needle that is centered directly on a line, and represents a needle that is perfectly centered between two lines. The uniform PDF assumes the needle is equally likely to fall anywhere in this range, but could not fall outside of it.

The uniform probability density function of between 0 and is
:formula_3

Here, represents a needle that is parallel to the marked lines, and radians represents a needle that is perpendicular to the marked lines. Any angle within this range is assumed an equally likely outcome.

The two random variables, and , are independent, so the joint probability density function is the product
:formula_4

The needle crosses a line if

:formula_5

Now there are two cases.

=== Case 1: Short needle () ===
Integrating the joint probability density function gives the probability that the needle will cross a line:

:formula_6

=== Case 2: Long needle () ===
Suppose . In this case, integrating the joint probability density function, we obtain:

:formula_7

where is the minimum between and .

Thus, performing the above integration, we see that, when , the probability that the needle will cross at least one line is

:formula_8
or
:formula_9

In the second expression, the first term represents the probability of the angle of the needle being such that it will always cross at least one line. The right term represents the probability that the needle falls at an angle where its position matters, and it crosses the line.

Alternatively, notice that whenever has a value such that , that is, in the range , the probability of crossing is the same as in the short needle case. However if , that is, the probability is constant and is equal to 1. 

:formula_10

== Using elementary calculus ==
The following solution for the &quot;short needle&quot; case, while equivalent to the one above, has a more visual flavor, and avoids iterated integrals.

We can calculate the probability as the product of two probabilities: , where is the probability that the center of the needle falls close enough to a line for the needle to possibly cross it, and is the probability that the needle actually crosses the line, given that the center is within reach.

Looking at the illustration in the above section, it is apparent that the needle can cross a line if the center of the needle is within units of either side of the strip. Adding from both sides and dividing by the whole width , we obtain .

Now, we assume that the center is within reach of the edge of the strip, and calculate . To simplify the calculation, we can assume that formula_11.

Let and be as in the illustration in this section. Placing a needle&#x27;s center at , the needle will cross the vertical axis if it falls within a range of radians, out of radians of possible orientations. This represents the gray area to the left of in the figure. For a fixed , we can express as a function of : . Now we can let range from 0 to 1, and integrate:

:formula_12

Multiplying both results, we obtain as above.

There is an even more elegant and simple method of calculating the &quot;short needle case&quot;. The end of the needle farthest away from any one of the two lines bordering its region must be located within a horizontal (perpendicular to the bordering lines) distance of (where is the angle between the needle and the horizontal) from this line in order for the needle to cross it. The farthest this end of the needle can move away from this line horizontally in its region is . The probability that the farthest end of the needle is located no more than a distance away from the line (and thus that the needle crosses the line) out of the total distance it can move in its region for is given by

: formula_13

== Without integrals ==
The short-needle problem can also be solved without any integration, in a way that explains the formula for from the geometric fact that a circle of diameter will cross the distance strips always (i.e. with probability 1) in exactly two spots. This solution was given by Joseph-Émile Barbier in 1860 and is also referred to as &quot;Buffon&#x27;s noodle&quot;.

== Estimating ==
In the first, simpler case above, the formula obtained for the probability can be rearranged to
:formula_14

Thus, if we conduct an experiment to estimate , we will also have an estimate for .

Suppose we drop needles and find that of those needles are crossing lines, so is approximated by the fraction . This leads to the formula:

:formula_15

In 1901, Italian mathematician Mario Lazzarini performed Buffon&#x27;s needle experiment. Tossing a needle 3,408 times, he obtained the well-known approximation for , accurate to six decimal places.
Lazzarini&#x27;s &quot;experiment&quot; is an example of confirmation bias, as it was set up to replicate the already well-known approximation of (in fact, there is no better rational approximation with fewer than five digits in the numerator and denominator, see also Milü), yielding a more accurate &quot;prediction&quot; of than would be expected from the number of trials, as follows:
Lazzarini chose needles whose length was of the width of the strips of wood. In this case, the probability that the needles will cross the lines is . Thus if one were to drop needles and get crossings, one would estimate as
:formula_16

So if Lazzarini was aiming for the result , he needed and such that
:formula_17
or equivalently,
:formula_18

To do this, one should pick as a multiple of 213, because then is an integer; one then drops needles, and hopes for exactly successes. If one drops 213 needles and happens to get 113 successes, then one can triumphantly report an estimate of accurate to six decimal places. If not, one can just do 213 more trials and hope for a total of 226 successes; if not, just repeat as necessary. Lazzarini performed trials, making it seem likely that this is the strategy he used to obtain his &quot;estimate&quot;.

The above description of strategy might even be considered charitable to Lazzarini. A statistical analysis of intermediate results he reported for fewer tosses leads to a very low probability of achieving such close agreement to the expected value all through the experiment. This makes it very possible that the &quot;experiment&quot; itself was never physically performed, but based on numbers concocted from imagination to match statistical expectations, but too well, as it turns out.

Dutch science journalist Hans van Maanen argues, however, that Lazzarini&#x27;s article was never meant to be taken too seriously as it would have been pretty obvious for the readers of the magazine (aimed at school teachers) that the apparatus that Lazzarini said to have built cannot possibly work as described.

==Laplace&#x27;s extension (short needle case)==
Now consider the case where the plane contains two sets of parallel lines orthogonal to one another, creating a standard perpendicular grid. We aim to find the probability that the needle intersects at least one line on the grid. Let and be the sides of the rectangle that contains the midpoint of the needle whose length is . Since this is the short needle case, , . Let mark the coordinates of the needle&#x27;s midpoint and let mark the angle formed by the needle and the -axis. Similar to the examples described above, we consider , , to be independent uniform random variables over the ranges , , .

To solve such a problem, we first compute the probability that the needle crosses no lines, and then we take its complement. We compute this first probability by determining the volume of the domain where the needle crosses no lines and then divide that by the volume of all possibilities, . We can easily see that .

Now let be the volume of possibilities where the needle does not intersect any line. Developed by J.V. Uspensky,

:formula_19

where is the region where the needle does not intersect any line given an angle . To determine , let&#x27;s first look at the case for the horizontal edges of the bounding rectangle. The total side length is and the midpoint must not be within of either endpoint of the edge. Thus, the total allowable length for no intersection is or simply just . Equivalently, for the vertical edges with length , we have . The ± accounts for the cases where is positive or negative. Taking the positive case and then adding the absolute value signs in the final answer for generality, we get

:formula_20

Now we can compute the following integral: 

:formula_21

Thus, the probability that the needle does not intersect any line is

:formula_22 

And finally, if we want to calculate the probability, , that the needle does intersect at least one line, we need to subtract the above result from 1 to compute its compliment, yielding

:formula_23.

== Comparing estimators of ==

As mentioned above, Buffon&#x27;s needle experiment can be used to estimate . This fact holds for Laplace&#x27;s extension too since shows up in that answer as well. The following question then naturally arises and is discussed by E.F. Schuster in 1974.
Is Buffon&#x27;s experiment or Laplace&#x27;s a better estimator of the value of ? Since in Laplace&#x27;s extension there are two sets of parallel lines, we compare drops when there is a grid (Laplace), and drops in Buffon&#x27;s original experiment.

Let be the event that the needle intersects a horizontal line (parallel to the -axis)

:formula_24
and let be the event that the needle intersects a vertical line (parallel to the -axis)

:formula_25

For simplicity in the algebraic formulation ahead, let such that the original result in Buffon&#x27;s problem is . Furthermore, let drops.

Now let us examine for Laplace&#x27;s result, that is, the probability the needle intersects both a horizontal and a vertical line. We know that
:formula_26
From the above section, , or the probability that the needle intersects no lines is
:formula_27

We can solve for and using the following method:

:formula_28

Solving for and and plugging that into the original definition for a few lines above, we get
:formula_29

Although not necessary to the problem, it is now possible to see that . With the values above, we are now able to determine which of these estimators is a better estimator for . For the Laplace variant, let be the estimator for the probability that there is a line intersection such that
:formula_30.

We are interested in the variance of such an estimator to understand the usefulness or efficiency of it. To compute the variance of , we first compute where 

:formula_31
Solving for each part individually,
:formula_32

We know from the previous section that
:formula_33

yielding
:formula_34

Thus,
:formula_35

Returning to the original problem of this section, the variance of estimator is 
:formula_36

Now let us calculate the number of drops, , needed to achieve the same variance as 100 drops over perpendicular lines. If then we can conclude that the setup with only parallel lines is more efficient than the case with perpendicular lines. Conversely if is equal to or more than 200, than Buffon&#x27;s experiment is equally or less efficient, respectively. Let be the estimator for Buffon&#x27;s original experiment. Then, 

:formula_37
and
:formula_38

Solving for , 
:formula_39

Thus, it takes 222 drops with only parallel lines to have the same certainty as 100 drops in Laplace&#x27;s case. This isn&#x27;t actually surprising because of the observation that . Because and are negatively correlated random variables, they act to reduce the total variance in the estimator that is an average of the two of them. This method of variance reduction is known as the antithetic variates method.

<text>Penn Fields is an area to the south west of the City of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, within the Graiseley ward. It lies on the western side of Penn Road, the A449 trunk road to Kidderminster. The housing stock varies from modest terraced homes to large detached residences.
Notable buildings include the Bingley Enterprise Centre and Bantock Primary School. 

In April 2021, a planning application was submitted to demolish the Quality Hotel on the corner of Penn Road and Oaklands Road and construct a Lidl supermarket on the site. 

Roads of note include Lea Road, Jeffcock Road, Owen Road and Penn Road. 
Over the last decade, the area has suffered with a number of social issues. A number of incidents involving antisocial behaviour, a mysterious explosion and shootings have tarnished Penn Fields&#x27; reputation.

==Demographics==
The community is racially very mixed.
In the Penn Fields area there is a diverse culture with a mix of various cultures. Since 2007, a number of Slovaks, Polish, Czechs, Russians, Roma, Albanians and Lithuanians have moved into the area.

<text>The Toronto waterfront is the lakeshore of Lake Ontario in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It spans 46 kilometres between the mouth of Etobicoke Creek in the west and the Rouge River in the east.

==History==

Lake Ontario is a recent lake. As the last glaciation, the Laurentian glaciation receded, a number of proglacial lakes filled in basins adjacent to the glacier. One of those proglacial lakes was Lake Iroquois. Lake Iroquois was considerably deeper than Lake Ontario, as a lobe of the Laurentian glacier still filled the valley of what is now the St. Lawrence River. The southern boundary of Lake Iroquois was the Niagara escarpment. The lake flowed over the Niagara Escarpment east of Rochester, and flowed to the Atlantic Ocean down what is now the Mohawk River, to the Hudson River. The shoreline of Lake Iroquois can be observed in steep hills, such as that on the north side of Davenport Road. Casa Loma has a view of the harbour, four kilometres away, as it is on the height of the old shoreline.

When the glacier retreated from the St. Lawrence Valley, the shoreline receded to a much shallower level than today&#x27;s lake, as it takes time for land that had been under a heavy glacier to rebound. This lake was called Admiralty Lake.
Some sources suggest the drainage of the lake triggered the Upper Dryas climatic change. Some sources suggest the lake drained all the way to sea level and the lake became brackish.

Since the last ice age, silt deposits, borne mostly from the erosion of the Scarborough Bluffs and the eluvial rivers to the east were swept by strong, natural Lake Ontario currents creating prominent fingers of land away from the lakeshore in the current central waterfront area, including the Toronto Islands.
The shore of Lake Ontario (at least within present-day Toronto Harbour) is mostly landfill, extending a kilometre or more from the natural shoreline.

Adding to the existing silt deposits, Ashbridges Bay was filled in and the Port Lands area (Cherry Street to Leslie Street) was created in the early 1900s. The bay was filled in partly due to concerns about public health – locals had disposed of sewage, farm animal carcasses and household waste in the bay for years. During this period, the Don River, which used to flow into the bay to the south-west, was diverted (straightened) toward the harbour, first directly southward and later westward through the current configuration of the Keating Channel. Currently, there are proposals to restore the original natural watercourse of the Don, which would bring it closer to the downtown core. The modern harbour area was mostly formed through landfill in the years around the First World War, to allow for deeper container vessel wharf access. The central waterfront functioned as an important industrial area for many years, providing shipping access to communities from Port Union in the east to Mimico in the west.

Toronto expanded along the waterfront with new residential suburbs. West of the Humber River, outside the city limits, the waterfront has been mainly private lands fronting on the lake. East of the Humber River, within the city limits, the waterfront is under the control of the government. The Sunnyside lakefront from the Humber east to Jameson was filled in, creating new lands for recreational and park land uses. To the east of Sunnyside, the lands were originally military grounds, centred on Fort York. The Garrison lands became the Exhibition grounds and have been public ever since. To the east of the harbour area, parklands were built along the waterfront from Ashbridges Bay east to the eastern city border at Victoria Park. Further east, the Scarborough lands have been dominated by the Scarborough Bluffs and development could not proceed to the waterfront.

In the 1950s, the Gardiner Expressway project, connecting suburbs to the west, substantially changed the western waterfront. As the Toronto area prospered and the downtown lands became more developed, industry began to move out of the central area seeking cheaper land in the suburbs. This left behind many heavily polluted sites (some of the main uses of the waterfront were oil and coal storage, waste disposal and incineration, and heavy manufacturing especially in Toronto harbour). The railway lands just to the north of the waterfront now became too valuable to keep industrial and have been converted to other uses, starting with the CN Tower in the 1970s. The railway lands became the site of the SkyDome (now Rogers Centre), the Toronto Convention Centre, office buildings and numerous condominium residential buildings.

Tonnage to the Toronto Port has declined over the past 50 years, replaced by increases in other modes of transportation. The Toronto Harbour Commission was eventually dissolved, its lands transferred to the City except for those specifically to be controlled by the successor Toronto Port Authority, which retained authority over transportation uses in the Port, including the Island Airport. The federal government created the authority along with others around Canada to manage ports in a more business-like fashion. Following its mandate, the Port Authority has made attempts to increase usage of the Port, initiating a Ship Terminal and Ferry Service to Rochester, a container facility in the Port lands and plans to expand the usage of the Island Airport, although expanded use of the Island Airport is opposed by local residents and organizations, and puts it at odds with the current City of Toronto council.

The 1972 Canadian election saw a further step in the conversion of the central waterfront away from industrial uses. The Federal Liberals promised to improve Toronto&#x27;s waterfront, expropriating the area from Bathurst Street to York Street along the waterfront for the &quot;Harbourfront&quot; project. Some buildings, such as Queen&#x27;s Quay Terminal and Harbourfront Centre were remodeled, and others such as Maple Leaf Mills Silos demolished and replaced by new structures. The areas south of Queens Quay have been changed mainly to cultural and recreational uses and the area north of Queens Quay has been redeveloped into condominium residential towers. West of Bathurst Street, the lands have been converted into a new residential area.

The area between York Street and Jarvis Street along the water has remained in private ownership except for the Jack Layton Ferry Terminal. Residential condominiums and the large Harbour Castle hotel were built along the water and the Toronto Star built a new headquarters office building at Yonge Street.

The Redpath Sugar Factory remains, and several industrial buildings have been converted into other uses. The area along the water has been primarily owned by the Toronto Harbour Commission, and eventually transferred to the City&#x27;s Economic Commission.

In 1988, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called another Royal Commission into the waterfront that was headed by former mayor David Crombie. It was reported in 1992 with a detailed, but expensive plan of environmentally sound development following on the heels of his 1982–86 Toronto Waterfront Regeneration Trust Commission report. Few, if any of the recommendations were carried out, as had been the case during the previous 60 years.

Toronto&#x27;s bids for the 1996 and 2008 Summer Olympics saw plans for much of the new facilities to be located along the waterfront, with all three levels of government committed to spending a great deal of money if the games were won, but on both attempts Toronto lost its bid due to the lack of diversity in facilities either planned or in situ and, except for further commercial condominium development at Harbourfront offering grandiose views of the water, the waterfront was unchanged.
The recent bid by Toronto for the World&#x27;s Fair 2015 also planned to use waterfront sites to accommodate the fair, but this bid also failed.

As of 2008, most of the lands to the east of Yonge Street, around and east of the Don River are slated for redevelopment directed by the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. Plans are to build predominantly low-rise developments, with a waterfront opened up to public uses, including recreation. The Don River, diverted into a channel is slated to become &#x27;naturalized&#x27; with more natural river banks and a more natural appearance.

==Areas==
===Western waterfront===

Etobicoke Creek forms the western border of the city of Toronto dividing it with neighbouring Mississauga, and its portion of the Lake Ontario waterfront. The Etobicoke section of the lakeshore is mainly privately owned with parklands and public lands. The neighbourhoods north of the lake are the former villages of Mimico, New Toronto and Long Branch, developed as suburbs of the original city. While in close proximity to the lake, these areas are also just to the south of the industrial belt surrounding the CNR rail line. Notable sights on this part of the waterfront include the lakeshore campus of Humber College, housed in a historic former asylum, and Humber Bay Park, and large park at the outlet of Mimico Creek. Both these sites have marinas. More parkland along the lakeshore is being built with the goal to extend the waterfront route of Martin Goodman Trail as far west as Long Branch.

The western border of the old city of Toronto (with Etobicoke) is marked by the Humber River. At the waterfront, this river is crossed by the prominent new Humber Bay Arch Bridge. From the Humber to Jameson Avenue in the east is the Sunnyside area of waterfront parklands and recreational uses. Adjoining the waterfront to the north is the large High Park. The Swansea, Roncesvalles, and Parkdale older neighbourhoods are north of the waterfront in this area.

East of Jameson Ave, the waterfront area is home to Exhibition Place with Ontario Place just to the south on three artificial islands. This area is also the former site of Fort Rouillé, one of the first European settlements in the region.

===Toronto Harbour===

To the east of Exhibition Place begins a long stretch of former commercial and industrial areas that are rapidly being converted into some of Toronto&#x27;s most expensive residences and condominiums. Historic commercial structures such as the Tip Top Tailors Building and the Queen&#x27;s Quay Terminal have been turned into luxury condominiums with waterfront views. Associated with this Queens Quay has become home to a number of high end shops and restaurants. This area is also home to the Harbourfront Centre, a large cultural centre occupying of former industrial land including an old power plant that is now a gallery. Some large industrial structures remain though most are shut down, most prominently the imposing Canada Malting Silos. Just to the north of the Gardiner is the former railway lands that have also seen rapid development in the years since deindustrialization. This area is home to the Rogers Centre (SkyDome) and CN Tower, both of which are prominently visible from the waterfront.

Between York and Yonge Streets is a cluster of large skyscrapers, many built in the 1970s in the first wave of redevelopment on the waterfront. This includes the Westin Harbour Castle Hotel and One Yonge Street. Also in this area was Captain John&#x27;s Harbour Boat Restaurant, a permanently docked cruise ship that served as a restaurant popular with tourists (now closed, and the ship has been removed) and the Redpath Sugar Building which remains an industrial site.

East of Yonge Street running to Cherry Street is a stretch of area known as the East Bayfront, centred on the Parliament Street slip. Currently a mix of warehouses and brownlands it is slated for development in the near future. &quot;Corus Quay&quot; is the first building to be built in the district as part of a public-private partnership led by TEDCO. It is expected that, in the next few years, thousands of new residences and millions of feet of commercial space will be built in this area. South of this, on two large projections separated by a ship canal, is the still-operating portion of Toronto Harbour which includes docking facilities for both freight and cruise ships.

The Toronto Islands, a chain of small natural islands, form the southern border of the Inner Harbour. Most of the islands are today parkland, with a handful of permanent inhabitants. The westernmost portion of the islands are dominated by the island airport. The island airport is linked to the mainland by a ferry at Bathurst Street. Controversy arose in 2003 when the port authority proposed replacing the ferry with a bridge, due to concerns about increased vehicle and air traffic along the waterfront. Mayor David Miller canceled the plans for the bridge soon after winning office. However, in 2009, a revised plan to connect the Island to the mainland emerged when the Toronto Port Authority began preliminary work on a $38 million pedestrian tunnel under the Western Gap, which was completed and opened to pedestrian traffic in 2015.

====Port Lands====

To the east of Cherry Street and the Inner Harbour is another area that is partially industrial and partially abandoned known as the Port Lands. This area is home to the shuttered Hearn Generating Station and the newly opened Portlands Energy Centre. There are long-term plans to transform this area into a mix of commercial and residential developments, but no firm proposals have been developed, except a new Film Studio sponsored by TEDCO. The southern portion of the Portlands was intended to be an outer harbour, but the demand for such a harbour never developed. Instead this area today is home to Cherry Beach, while the large breakwater known as the Leslie Street Spit is a popular park and birding area.
===The Beaches===

East of the Portlands begins the well-known Beaches area of Toronto. This part of the city is named after the series of four connected beaches that lie along this section of the lakeshore. The western boundary of this region was once home to the Greenwood Raceway. The racetrack was demolished in the 1990s and a new residential neighbourhood was constructed in its stead. The eastern boundary is the R. C. Harris Water Treatment Plant, still the source of much of Toronto&#x27;s water supply and also a prominent Art Deco monument.

===Eastern waterfront===

The Scarborough portion of the waterfront is dominated by the Scarborough Bluffs, a series of cliffs that run along the lakeshore for and standing at a height of at its highest point. On the top of the cliffs are a number of suburban neighbourhoods such as Cliffside, Cliffcrest, Scarborough Village, Guildwood and West Hill. This area is also home to large manicured properties such as Rosetta McClain Gardens and extensive grounds of the St. Augustine Seminary. The most prominent site along the creek juncture with the lakeshore is Bluffer&#x27;s Park, a large park and marina built on fill below the bluffs. The bluffs end at the ravines of Highland Creek.

East of Highland Creek is Port Union, named after a port facility that existed there from 1832 to 1873. The community was centred on the Adams Creek which was the site of a local ship builder who worked for the local merchants in the area which also had a winter harbour up the mouth of the Rouge River Valley. The little harbour disappeared in the late 1870s with the arrival of the Grand Trunk Railway. The railway built a causeway, as part of a bridge project, filling in part of the river, irreversibly changing the mouth of the Rouge River, negatively impacting the local environment. Remedial efforts began in 2001 to reverse the changes in the local environment, although the bridge and causeway remains. East of Port Union is West Rouge, Toronto&#x27;s easternmost neighbourhood. The eastern terminus of Lawrence Avenue is situated near the southeast portion of West Rouge&#x27;s waterfront.

The easternmost portion of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront forms a part of Rouge National Urban Park, a national park whose area includes the Rouge River, and its surrounding valleys. The park&#x27;s waterfront area includes Rouge Pond, Rouge Beach, and the mouth of the Rouge River. The Rouge River forms the eastern end of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront, as the river is used as the border between the City of Toronto and the neighbouring suburb to the east, Pickering. Two bridges connect Toronto&#x27;s waterfront with Pickering, a pedestrian bridge, and a railway bridge.

==Revitalization plans==
Waterfront revitalization has been a hot topic of debate in Toronto for decades. In 1972, the federal government established the &quot;Harbourfront Project&quot; which converted part of the central waterfront from industrial uses to cultural, recreational and residential uses. Harbourfront Centre and Queen&#x27;s Quay Terminal are legacies of that revitalization effort. In 1999, a task force was established to develop recommendations and a business plan for revitalization.

In 2001, following the recommendations of the task force, the federal, provincial and municipal governments established the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation (now known as Waterfront Toronto), to lead and manage the renewal of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront. The three levels of government committed $1.5 billion to launch the redevelopment initiative. Waterfront Toronto is overseen by a 13-member government appointed Board of Directors.

Waterfront revitalization is concentrated on Toronto&#x27;s central waterfront, an area that extends from Dowling Avenue in the west to Coxwell Avenue in the east. The revitalization of Toronto&#x27;s waterfront is one of the largest urban redevelopment project currently underway in North America with of largely underutilized, derelict land located steps away from Canada&#x27;s largest financial and cultural urban core. Full revitalization is projected to take 25 to 30 years and an estimated $17 billion in public and private funds to complete.

According to Waterfront Toronto&#x27;s master plan, once fully developed, Toronto&#x27;s waterfront will include 40,000 new residences (20% of which will be affordable housing), 40,000 new jobs, new transit infrastructure and of parks and public spaces.

Waterfront Toronto&#x27;s plans identify public accessibility to the waterfront and the development of parks and public spaces as major priorities. A variety of waterfront public space projects have already been completed by the organization including York and John Quay Promenades, improvements to Cherry Beach, the Western Beaches Watercourse, Marilyn Bell Park improvements and expansion of the Martin Goodman Trail from Marilyn Bell Park to Ontario Place and the completion of phase one Port Union Waterfront Park. The first phase on construction of the Central Waterfront and Mimico Waterfront Park were completed in summer 2008.

The first new neighborhoods to be developed by Waterfront Toronto are the East Bayfront and West Don Lands. These lands are now rezoned as mixed use developments. Based on plans developed in consultation with public stakeholders, these environmental communities will feature green roof tops, pedestrian-friendly streets, extensive parks and public spaces, affordable housing, public transit within a five-minute walk of all residences, schools, childcare and recreation facilities.

Site preparation activities and phase one infrastructure are currently underway in East Bayfront and West Don Lands. Waterfront Toronto launched the developer selection process for the East Bayfront in March 2008 and announced Urban Capital Property Group/Redquartz Developments as the first phase developer partner for the West Don Lands in April 2008.

===Central Waterfront Innovative Design Competition===

The Toronto waterfront has seen at least 15 design charettes over the last 65 years, the most recent being the Innovative Design Competition for the Central Waterfront that took place in 2006. This charette was won by a team led by West 8, a landscape architecture and urban design firm from Rotterdam, in joint venture with DTAH (du Toit Allsopp Hillier), a Toronto architecture, landscape architecture and urban design firm. The proposed design includes a wide promenade along the water and extensive green space. Bridges and WaveDecks rising from the boardwalk and spanning the ends of the slips will provide continuous public access to the lakeshore. Additionally, the southern half of Queens Quay will be turned into a pedestrian walkway. The proposal also emphasizes the need for stronger north–south connections between the harbour and the downtown core. The first phase was to be completed by 2008. As of January 2008, no such work has been undertaken, but private developers began construction of a condominium complex at the foot of Yonge Street, and TEDCO started construction of Corus Quay.

===Major issues===
*Some see the Gardiner Expressway, a raised highway that runs just north of the lakeshore, as a major obstacle to waterfront redevelopment. The highway is often seen as both a physical and psychological barrier for pedestrians that separates the city from the lake. Proposals call for the highway to be replaced with an at-grade level 10-lane thoroughfare or burying it (tunnelling), but implementation of any such plans would be extremely expensive and would entail massive traffic disruptions. Others claim that the railway lines just north of the Gardiner are the real barrier, and still others see the condominium towers built along the waterfront in the 1990s and 2000s as either a barrier, or contributing to the separation.
*The Portlands Energy Centre is a recently approved natural gas electrical generating station, which has met with large-scale local community opposition.
*The island airport generates both strong opposition and strong support from different groups both inside and outside the city, and was a major issue in the 2003 municipal election. Opposition by residents prevented the building of a bridge, but the Government of Canada paid a out-of-court settlement to the affected parties, part of which may have helped launch Porter Airlines. In 2015, there were plans to lengthen the airport runway and to allow jet aircraft.
*Renaturalization of the Don River mouth. The lower Don Lands are planned to be &quot;renaturalised&quot; and the surrounding flood plain area, including the downtown core, will be flood-proofed by building a berm (a plan that was first proposed in the early 60&#x27;s by City Planner Eric Arthur). There is currently an environmental assessment underway on this proposal which was waived by the Province. Ecologists are calling for a return to the lacustrine marsh that existed in Ashbridges Bay prior to extensive land filling done from the late 19th century on.
*The needs of existing recreational stakeholders. For over thirty years, several sailing, rowing, and windsurfing clubs have been using the area east of Cherry Beach and south of Unwin Avenue. These volunteer-run clubs, comprised collectively of up to 2,000 members, have spent many years building up physical and recreational infrastructure which would be difficult to replicate elsewhere.

The opened a 762mm gauge line between Amagasaki and Itami (about ) in 1891. In 1893, the horsecar railway was reorganized as , which introduced steam power to the railway and extended the line to Ikeda.

The Settsu Railway was merged by , which had a plan to build a railway between Osaka and Maizuru. The Hankaku Railway converted the line to 1067mm gauge and extended it to Takarazuka in 1897 and to Fukuchiyama in 1899. The company also connected the line to the Kanzaki Station (present-day Amagasaki Station) of the JGR line in 1898 making the line to the original Amagasaki terminal a branch. Hankaku Railway was nationalized on August 1, 1907.

The Amagasaki – Tsukaguchi section was duplicated in 1934, and extended to Takarazuka in 1979/80. The Takarazuka – Shin-Sanda section was duplicated in 1986 in conjunction with the opening of the Najio tunnel and associated deviation, which shortened the route by . Duplication to Sasayamaguchi was completed in 1996.

The Amagasaki – Tsukaguchi section was electrified in 1956, and extended to Takarazuka in 1981. The remainder of the line was electrified in 1986.

CTC signalling was commissioned between Fukuchiyama and Sasayamaguchi in 1982, extended to Hirono in 1984 and to Amagasaki in 1986.

The branchline between Amagasakikō Station (former Amagasaki terminal of the horsecar railway) and Tsukaguchi Station ceased passenger operation in 1981 and freight operation in 1984.

===Former connecting lines===
* Sanda station – The Arima Line, a 12 km line to Arima operated from 1915 to 1943.
* Sasayama-guchi station – The Sasayama Railway, a line to Sasayama-Chō opened in 1915. The private railway was discontinued in 1944 when the Sasayama Line of the Japanese Government Railways opened. The Sasayama Line closed in 1972.
