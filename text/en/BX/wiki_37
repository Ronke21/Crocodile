<text>Hainuwele, &quot;The Coconut Girl&quot;, is a figure from the Wemale and Alune folklore of the island of Seram in the Maluku Islands, Indonesia. Her story is an origin myth.

The myth of Hainuwele was recorded by German ethnologist Adolf E. Jensen following the Frobenius Institute&#x27;s 1937–38 expedition to the Maluku Islands. The study of this myth during his research on religious sacrifice led Jensen to the introduction of the concept of Dema Deity in ethnology.

Joseph Campbell first narrated the Hainuwele legend to an English-speaking audience in his work &quot;The Masks of God&quot;.

==Myth==
While hunting one day a man named Ameta found a coconut, something never before seen on Seram, that had been caught in the tusk of a wild boar. Ameta, who was part of one of the original nine families of the West Ceram people who had emerged from bananas, took the coconut home. That night, a figure appeared in a dream and instructed him to plant the coconut. Ameta did so, and in just a few days the coconut grew into a tall tree and bloomed. Ameta climbed the tree to cut the flowers to collect the sap, but in the process slashed his finger and the blood dropped onto a blossom. 

Nine days later, Ameta found in the place of this blossom a girl whom he named Hainuwele, meaning &quot;Coconut Branch&quot;. He wrapped her in a sarong and brought her home. She grew to maturity with astonishing rapidity. Hainuwele had a remarkable talent: when she defecated she excreted valuable items. Thanks to these, Ameta became very rich.

Hainuwele attended a dance that was to last for nine nights at a place known as &quot;Tamene Siwa&quot;. In this dance, it was traditional for girls to distribute areca nuts to the men. Hainuwele did so, but when the men asked her for areca nuts, she gave them instead the valuable things which she was able to excrete. 

Each day she gave them something bigger and more valuable: golden earrings, coral, porcelain dishes, bush-knives, copper boxes, and gongs. The men were happy at first, but gradually they decided that what Hainuwele was doing was uncanny and, driven by jealousy, they decided to kill her on the ninth night.

In the successive dances, the men circled around the women at the center of the dance ground, Hainuwele amongst them, who handed out gifts. Before the ninth night, the men dug a pit in the center of the dance ground and, singling out Hainuwele, in the course of the dance they pushed her further and further inward until she was pushed right into the pit. The men quickly heaped earth over the girl, covering her cries with their song. Thus Hainuwele was buried alive, while the men kept dancing on the dirt stomping it firmly down.

Ameta, missing Hainuwele, went in search for her. Through an oracle he found out what had happened, then he exhumed her corpse and cut it into pieces which he then re-buried around the village. These pieces grew into various new useful plants, including tubers, giving origin to the principal foods the people of Indonesia have enjoyed ever since.

Ameta brought Hainuwele&#x27;s cut arms to &quot;mulua Satene&quot;, the ruling deity over humans. With them, she built for him a gate in spiral shape through which all men should pass. Those who would be able to step across the gate would remain human beings, although henceforward mortal, becoming divided into &quot;Patalima&quot; (Men of the five) and &quot;Patasiwa&quot; (Men of the nine). Those unable to pass through the threshold became new kinds of animals or ghosts. Satene herself left the Earth and became ruler over the realm of the dead. 

&quot;Patasiwa&quot; is the group to which both the Wemale and the Alune people belong.

==Analysis and interpretation==

===Dema deity myth===

Hainuwele can be understood as a creation myth in which the natural environment, the daily tasks of men, and the social structures are given meaning. In the myth, spirits and plants are created, and an explanation is provided for the mortality of mankind and the formation of tribal divisions within the Wemale ethnic group. Jensen identifies the Hainuwele figure with a Dema deity. 

According to Jensen, the belief in a Dema deity is typical of cultures based on basic plant cultivation as opposed to cultures of hunter-gatherers, as well as complex agricultural cultures such as those based on the cultivation of grain. Jensen identifies the worship of Dema deities in the context of many different cultures worldwide. He assumes that it dates back to the Neolithic Revolution in the early history of mankind. One of the main characteristics of Dema deities is that they are killed by early immortal men (‘Dema’) and hacked to pieces that are strewn about or buried.

Jensen found versions of the basic pattern of what could be defined as &quot;Hainuwele Complex,&quot; in which a ritual murder and burial originates the tuberous crops on which people lived, spread throughout Southeast Asia and elsewhere. He contrasted these myths of the first era of agriculture, using root crops, with those in Asia and beyond that explained the origin of rice as coming from a theft from heaven, a pattern of myth found among grain-crop agriculturalists. These delineate two different eras and cultures in the history of agriculture itself.

The earliest one transformed hunting-and-gathering societies&#x27; totemistic myths such as we find in Australian Aboriginal cultures, in response to the discovery of food cultivation, and centered on a Dema deity arising from the earth, and the later-developing grain-crop cultures centered on a sky god. Jensen explored the far-reaching culture-historical implications of these and other insights in his later work &quot;Myth and Cult among Primitive Peoples&quot;, published in 1963.

The worship of a Dema-deity implies that the creation of new life is inevitably attached to the end of life, to death. In light of this fact Jensen indicates that some rituals of the Wemale people, such as the “Maro dance,” include many elements of the Hainuwele myth. Therefore, myth and ritual were structured in a unity of meaning.

Recent research, however, disputes the use of the term Dema-deity in the context of the Hainuwele story. It disagrees with the definition of the legend as a creation myth, preferring to define it as an origin myth. From the standpoint of cultural morphology, the idea of the Dema-deity is already problematic. Jensen assumes a connection between highly dissimilar myths of different cultures located in areas that are separated by great distances. Moreover, these purported parallels are not supported by archaeological or empirical data.

Additionally, among indigenous people in Seram, there are different versions of the origin myth in which the &quot;magic&quot; female secretly brought forth foodstuffs, sagu and valuable items from her menstrual blood and/or vagina (i.e., menstruated or born from her vagina rather than defecated) 

Some versions suggest the menstrual blood allowed these items to emerge from the earth. When discovered, she turned into the &quot;original&quot; sago starch producing tree (pohon sageru; the sugar palm - Arenga pinnata). This seems partly unusual as Metroxylon sagu is primarily used for starch extraction - one of the most important starch staples of Malukans. Metroxylon also produces palm fronds and leaves for house construction of walls, floorings, and thatch. On the other hand, the Arenga palm is useful to produce sugar, sweet and alcoholic beverages, and sago starch.

===Social anthropological interpretation===
The interpretation of the Hainuwele myth has put greater stress on the anthropological aspects. It underlines the fact that, since she had defecated them, the gifts that the generous girl Hainuwele was giving out had an unclean origin and, although useful, they defiled the persons accepting them. The uncanny way in which the material gifts were brought forward points out the reality that all the objects enumerated in the myth were foreign, not produced in Seram, and thus not available on the island before the 16th century. 

Alternatively, archaeological evidence from Seram and Ambon among other Malukan islands indicates 11th-14th century Song-Yuan Dynasty stoneware ceramics were quite prevalent; the green glazed Celadons being particularly important in marriage ritual exchanges and dispute settlements. 

There are Thai and Vietnamese glazed ceramics from the 14th century onwards, increasing in abundance during the various Ming Gaps in Chinese trade policy and practice. Interestingly, the distribution includes not only coastal port sites (such as Hitu and Hitu Lama on Ambon; or Serapi near Hatusua on Seram), but remote hinterland and highland sites. This indicates the regional and extra-regional value chains included both coastal, port, and inland (highland, hinterland) areas and peoples. Bronze drums and gongs have been available for over 2000 years. Gorom still has an excellent example of a bronze Dongson drum made in Vietnam. Dongson drums were distributed throughout the archipelago and likely related to the spice trade reaching as far as China since at least the Han Dynasty over 2000 years ago where cloves were mandatory for visitors to the court to freshen their breath. Spices from Maluku also made it westward, eventually to the Mideast and Europe well before the European Colonial Period began in the early 16th century (estimated at least to the first and early second millennia CE). 

Gold, silver, bronze (especially gongs), glass (bangles and beads), and iron items were also available prior to western colonialism - although mostly traded in rather than locally produced. The small Indo-Pacific bead technology originated from Arikamedu, India over 2000 years ago. The beads, for example, are culturally valuable items still in circulation today. It remains unknown if similar beads were also produced in Southeast Asia (primarily mainland Southeast Asia) using similar technology or possibly artisans and master craftsmen from India. In either case, it demonstrates the length, extent, and inclusion of nested regional to extra-regional value chains. 

Pre-colonial Chinese glass bangle fragments were also recovered from radiocarbon dated excavation contexts in Seram in the 1990s (dated to at least the Srivijaya period in the mid to late first millennium CE). Spices (clove, nutmeg and mace) were central to the extra-regional trade and demand. These items were endemic to Maluku and seeking control of the source drove much of Western Colonialism (e.g., the Portuguese dispatched ships to Maluku in 1512 after seizing Melaka in Malaysia in 1511). 

Nevertheless, many other items were very important - such as pearls, pearl shell, aromatic woods, birds of paradise feathers, etc. as well as and many foodstuffs such as sago (Metroxolyn sagu), kenari (Canarium spp.), palm sugar (Arenga pinnata), fermented palm drinks (sageru; sometimes distilled to make much stronger sopi), tripang, fish, meat, and others.

Hainuwele&#x27;s variety of presents brought about an element of corruption, bringing about inequality, greed, and jealousy into a roughly homogeneous society, represented by the standard present of areca nuts. Hence the various gifts of the Coconut girl can be interpreted as &quot;dirty money&quot;, polluting and degrading everyone who accepts it, bringing about a socioeconomic conflict and the deviation from an ideal state. 

Thus, the Hainuwele legend as recorded by Jensen was a myth that sought to rearrange the inconsistencies with which the Wemale were confronted as the elements of change affected their society by trying to bring about agreement of the more recent socioeconomic clash with the older mythical representations.

Following the conflict brought about by the material objects that were obtained through Hainuwele the introduction of mortality among humans became a sort of compensation in order to reintroduce peace with the world of spirits and deities. Thus the Hainuwele myth signals the end of an era and the beginning of another.

Several of these interpretations are highly debatable. Some local versions display generic consistencies but substantial nuanced variations. Numerous interpretations (positive, neutral and negative) can be posited and have been offered by local specialists. Additionally, Jensen&#x27;s initial translations and interpretations (or subsequent interpretations by others) may be partially erroneous and/or questionably representative of the larger populations and diverse social groups they are meant to portray as a single cultural unit of analysis in parts of Seram Island, Seram Island as a whole, or neighboring islands in Central Maluku.

<text>The Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly () is the unicameral deliberative assembly of the [[General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador]] of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It meets in the Confederation Building in St. John&#x27;s. Bills passed by the assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador, in the name of the King of Canada.

The governing party sits on the left side of the speaker of the House of Assembly as opposed to the traditional right side of the speaker. This tradition dates back to the 1850s as the heaters in the Colonial Building were located on the left side. Thus, the government chose to sit near the heat, and leave the opposition sitting in the cold.

==Homes of Legislature==

Before 1850 the legislature has sat at various locations including Mary Travers&#x27; tavern on Duckworth Street across from War Memorial 1832, St. John&#x27;s Court House (at Duckworth and Church Hill) from 1833 to 1846, a building on southwest corner of Water Street and Prescott Street (since replaced with office building) and the site of the former St. Patrick’s Hall on Queen’s Road and Garrison Hill (demolished and replace by current building 1880). 

Permanent homes of the legislature, Confederation Building and Colonial Building, are the only surviving structures.

== Constituencies ==

Members represent one electoral district each. There are 40 seats in the House of Assembly.

==Seating plan==
==Current members (MHAs)==

<text>The Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia, commonly abbreviated as the AVNOJ, was a deliberative and legislative body that was established in Bihać, Yugoslavia, in November 1942. It was established by Josip Broz Tito, the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans, an armed resistance movement led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to resist the Axis occupation of the country during World War II.

The AVNOJ reconvened in Jajce in 1943 and in Belgrade in 1945, shortly after the war in Europe ended. Between the sessions, it operated through its presidency, its executive council, and the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia. The committee was granted authority normally wielded by cabinets. While Tito presided over the committee, the AVNOJ sessions and its presidency were chaired by Ivan Ribar. The second session of the AVNOJ proclaimed itself Yugoslavia&#x27;s new legislative body and decided that it should be a multi-ethnic federal state.

By 1944, the Western Allies and the Yugoslav government-in-exile recognised the AVNOJ as the all-Yugoslav legislative body. The third session of the AVNOJ was convened in preparation of the Constituent Assembly when the Yugoslav Parliament was convened again in 1945. Decisions of the AVNOJ determined there would be six units in the federation and defined their borders. It also took over the position of the legitimate ruling body of Yugoslavia from the government-in-exile in dealings with the Allies.

==Background==
===Invasion and uprising===
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia acceded to the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941 under pressure from Nazi Germany. The latter sought to protect its southern flank before the planned invasion of the Soviet Union, while ensuring the availability of transport routes and economic resources in the Balkans where the Greco-Italian War was in progress. In response to the pact, Royal Yugoslav Armed Forces generals staged a coup d&#x27;état deposing the government and Prince Regent Paul. Royal Yugoslav Air Force General Dušan Simović became the Prime Minister and the regency was abolished by declaring Peter II of Yugoslavia of age and thus the king even though he was only seventeen.

On 6 April 1941, the Axis powers invaded and quickly occupied Yugoslavia. Parts of the country were annexed by its neighbours, and the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) was carved out as a Ustaše-ruled Axis puppet state. With the country&#x27;s defeat imminent, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ) instructed its 8,000 members to stockpile weapons in anticipation of armed resistance. By the end of 1941, the armed resistance spread to all areas of the country except Macedonia. Building experience in clandestine operation across the country, the KPJ proceeded to organise the Yugoslav Partisans as resistance fighters led by Josip Broz Tito. The KPJ believed that the German invasion of the Soviet Union had created favourable conditions for an uprising. The KPJ politburo founded the Supreme Headquarters of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia with Tito as commander-in-chief on 27 June 1941 and the Partisans waged war against the occupying powers until 1945.

===Government-in-exile===
King Peter II and the government fled Yugoslavia in April 1941 when it became apparent the royal army would not be able to defend the country. The decision to abandon organised armed resistance put the Yugoslav government-in-exile in a weak position, further eroded by political differences between ministers. The government, an extension of the post-coup government led by Simović, based its legitimacy on the 1931 Yugoslav Constitution, which made it responsible to the king. It lost three Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) ministers including the party&#x27;s leader and the deputy prime minister Vladko Maček, who resigned and stayed in the country. The HSS thus split and lost influence. Džafer Kulenović, the only minister drawn from the Yugoslav Muslim Organization, also resigned.

The government-in-exile was split along an ethnic line separating the HSS from a bloc of Serb ministers drawn from several disunited parties. The divisions deepened because the HSS ministers were reluctant to publicly discuss and condemn Ustaše atrocities against Serbs in late 1941. In January 1942, Simović was replaced by Slobodan Jovanović and his decision to support the Chetniks widened the rift with the HSS ministers. Jovanović saw the Chetniks as a guerrilla force promising the restoration of the monarchy after the war. In combination with fear of communism, this led him to ignore information about Chetnik collaboration with the Axis powers, and appoint their leader Draža Mihailović the Minister of the Army, Navy and Air Forces. At the same time, the government promoted Mihailović to Army General and formally renamed the Chetniks the &quot;Yugoslav Army in the Homeland&quot;. In June 1943, Jovanović resigned, unable to reunite the ministers, and his replacement Miloš Trifunović also resigned after less than two months. In August, Božidar Purić was appointed the prime minister of a largely administrative government mostly composed of civil servants, although Mihailović retained his ministerial position.

==First session==

In November 1942, the Partisans captured Bihać and secured control over a large part of western Bosnia, Dalmatia and Lika, which they called the Bihać Republic. On 26 and 27 November, the pan-Yugoslav Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ) was established in the town at the initiative of Tito and the KPJ. At its founding session, the AVNOJ adopted the principle of a multi-ethnic federal state as the basis for the country&#x27;s future government but did not officially determine what system of government would be implemented after the war. There was a degree of ambiguity regarding the number of future federal units and whether they would all have equal status within the federation.

The AVNOJ also did not mention the international recognition of the London-based Yugoslav government-in-exile, backed by the Western Allies; Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not wish to antagonise the Allies by supporting the Partisans. Shortly before the Bihać session, Tito added the expression &quot;Anti-Fascist&quot; to the original name of the AVNOJ to emphasise its temporary and anti-Axis nature. These steps were made in response to Soviet positions expressed in correspondence in July–November 1942 between the KPJ and Moscow. The Comintern urged Tito to establish a political body solely to liberate the country and not to oppose the Yugoslav monarchy. The Soviets asked the AVNOJ not to openly advance a communist agenda in order to avoid antagonising the Western Allies, and cautioned against appointing Tito president of the AVNOJ.
AVNOJ delegates represented specific parts of Yugoslavia: seventeen for Bosnia and Herzegovina, fifteen for Croatia, fourteen each for Serbia and Montenegro, eight for Slovenia, six for the Sandžak, and three for Vojvodina. This distribution reflected the number of Partisans from each part of the country taking part in the armed struggle. Some of the selected delegates, including all of those representing Slovenia and Vojvodina and twelve others, did not arrive. The Slovene delegation informed the AVNOJ of its support by telegram. Macedonia was not represented at all. The AVNOJ elected its presidency with Ivan Ribar as president and Pavle Savić and Nurija Pozderac as vice-presidents. Ribar had been the first President of the Constitutional Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later renamed Yugoslavia.

The AVNOJ also appointed an executive council presided by Ribar. It had three vice-presidents—Edvard Kocbek, Nurija Pozderac, and Pavle Savić—and six other members: Mladen Iveković (social affairs), Veselin Masleša (propaganda), Simo Milošević (health), Ivan Milutinović (economy), Mile Peruničić (internal affairs), and
Vlada Zečević (religious affairs). The executive council was not formally considered a government, and Tito told the Bihać session of the AVNOJ that a government could not be formed for international reasons. Instead, he described the executive council as a political instrument to mobilise people.

After the Bihać meeting, land councils were established as political bodies representative of what was expected to be individual parts of the future federation. In January 1943, the executive council of the AVNOJ announced the &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Loan&quot;, an attempt to raise half a billion kuna for the Partisan cause. The NDH&#x27;s Ustaše regime launched a propaganda campaign in November 1942 to discredit the AVNOJ and portray the Partisans&#x27; struggle as pro-Serb and anti-Croat. The campaign, which declined after March 1943, involved the publication of brochures and newspaper articles as well as several rallies. Serb participation in the uprisings was highlighted while Croat or Bosnian Muslim AVNOJ participants were either not mentioned, labelled traitors, or misnamed. Ribar&#x27;s name was misrepresented as Slovene-sounding &quot;Janez Ribar&quot;.

Tito describes the purpose of AVNOJ in his work &quot;The Yugoslav peoples fight for freedom&quot; in 1944:


==Second session==
===Delegates===
After Italy defected to the Allies and Western Allied forces advanced towards Yugoslavia, Tito announced another session of the AVNOJ. Since the previous session, the Western Allies began to support the Partisans, and Tito considered a British landing in Yugoslavia likely. In October 1943, just before the second session, the KPJ central committee established the National Committee for the Liberation of Yugoslavia (NKOJ), an all-Yugoslav executive body, appointed to perform the role of an interim government.

The AVNOJ reconvened in Jajce on 29 and 30 November 1943; Ribar chaired the meeting as president of the executive council. The KPJ originally planned for the second session of the AVNOJ to be attended by 250 delegates elected by regional land councils. The number of delegates was subsequently increased by 53 to include delegates from Macedonia and the Sandžak. In total, 78 delegates were to be elected in Croatia, 53 in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 53 in Serbia, 42 in Slovenia, 42 in Macedonia, 16 in Montenegro, 11 in Sandžak, and 8 in Vojvodina. Of the planned 303, 142 delegates arrived by the start of the session and 163 deputy delegates also attended the session. No deputies from Sandžak or Macedonia were present. The Main National Liberation Committee for Serbia was unable to hold elections because of the German occupation of Serbia. Instead, the Serbian delegates were appointed by individual Partisan units originally from Serbia; as a result, eastern Yugoslavia was underrepresented.


===Building blocks for a new state===

The AVNOJ made several decisions of the highest political and constitutional significance. It declared itself the supreme legislative body in the country and the representation of Yugoslav sovereignty; affirmed a commitment to forming a democratic federation; and recognised the equal standing of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia in the future federation. Only Sandžak was listed with other lower-ranked regional entities, even though its land council was still included among the &quot;seven basic bodies of people&#x27;s government&quot;. Though the position of individual nations and regions were not further elaborated, the second session of the AVNOJ determined the type of federal system to be introduced in Yugoslavia, modelling it on the Soviet Union.

Tito&#x27;s views prevailed over the model adopted by the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Croatia and the Communist Party of Croatia (KPH), a nominally independent part of the KPJ established in Croatia. The KPH leader Andrija Hebrang advocated a loose Yugoslav federation where communist parties and bodies established in federal units would be sovereign. In contrast, Tito&#x27;s vision for the federal units was as administrative divisions only. Hebrang was replaced in late 1944 by Vladimir Bakarić, who aligned the KPH&#x27;s views on federalism to Tito&#x27;s.

The AVNOJ also denied the legitimacy of the Yugoslav government-in-exile and forbade the return of King Peter II to the country until its people could decide on the future of the monarchy after the war. It also declared all agreements previously concluded by the government-in-exile to be subject to review and approval, renegotiation or cancellation while declaring any further agreements concluded by the government-in-exile void. Furthermore, the AVNOJ declared that Yugoslavia had never accepted the 1941 partition. Finally, Tito was awarded the rank of Marshal of Yugoslavia.

The AVNOJ elected a new presidency consisting of sixty-three members, chaired by Ribar. Five vice-presidents were appointed: Antun Augustinčić, Moša Pijade, , Dimitar Vlahov, and . Radonja Golubović and Rodoljub Čolaković were appointed secretaries of the presidency. Some of the AVNOJ delegates were non-Communists so the presidency included some non-Communist members of the pre-war HSS and the Independent Democratic Party. The NKOJ was confirmed in the role of the government. Tito was appointed the president of the NKOJ and had three vice-presidents. Two were KPJ members Edvard Kardelj and , and the remaining one was Božidar Magovac of the HSS. Finally, the AVNOJ formally praised and thanked Tito&#x27;s Supreme Headquarters, and the Partisan forces for their armed struggle.

===Allied recognition and developments in 1944===

On 15 January 1944, the AVNOJ introduced multilingualism to its proceedings, deciding to publish its official work in Serbian, Croatian, Slovene and Macedonian. In February, the AVNOJ and the NKOJ adopted a new emblem of the future federation at Tito&#x27;s request. The emblem consisted of five lit torches burning as one flame representing five united nations; this was framed by sheaves, topped by a red five-pointed star, and crossed by a blue stripe bearing the name of the country, Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.

Stalin was enraged by the AVNOJ&#x27;s rejection of Soviet advice in its establishment of the NKOJ as an interim government and explicit repudiation of the government-in-exile. Stalin was specifically worried about Tito&#x27;s assumption of the presidency of the NKOJ and his elevation to the rank of Marshal. He thought that this would signal to the Western Allies that the KPJ was actually fighting for a revolution. Stalin was further angered by the fact that he received no prior notice of the decisions.

To Stalin&#x27;s surprise, the Western Allies did not strongly oppose the AVNOJ&#x27;s decisions. The flow of British equipment and arms to the Partisans, which had started in the second half of 1943 on the basis of the Churchill&#x27;s Mediterranean strategy, continued. Only days after the AVNOJ&#x27;s second session, the Allies recognised the Partisans as an Allied force at the Tehran Conference, and cut off further aid to the Chetniks. On British Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s urging, the government-in-exile led by Ivan Šubašić and the Tito-led NKOJ signed the Treaty of Vis on 16 June 1944; the government-in-exile recognised the AVNOJ in return for the NKOJ&#x27;s pledge to postpone the decision on the constitution of Yugoslavia until after the war. Tito and Šubašić concluded another agreement on 1 November in Belgrade; Šubašić confirmed AVNOJ as Yugoslavia&#x27;s legislative body and agreed to form a new 18-person government. Six of the members would come from the government-in-exile and twelve would be NKOJ members. The second session of the AVNOJ also drew a response from the Chetnik leadership. At the Ba Congress held in January 1944, they proposed an alternative solution for the post-war government. The congress also condemned the AVNOJ in line with the contemporary Chetnik propaganda as a product of collaboration of Communists and Ustaše against Serbs.

===Persecution of Germans===
On 21 November 1944, the presidency of the AVNOJ declared the Germans of Yugoslavia to be collectively guilty for the war and enemies of Yugoslavia. Germans in Partisan-controlled areas were interned. Prior to 1944, about half a million Germans lived in Yugoslavia. About 240,000 were evacuated before the arrival of the Red Army, another 150,000 were later deported to the USSR to work as forced labour, 50,000 died in Yugoslav-run labor camps and 15,000 were killed by the Partisans. Most of the others were expelled from Yugoslavia and German property was confiscated. By the time of 1948 census, fewer than 56,000 ethnic Germans remained.

==Third session==
At Allied suggestion, in February 1945 the AVNOJ was expanded to include members drawn from Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo-Metohija, which had not been represented at its second session. The AVNOJ was expanded again in late March to include 54 members of the pre-war Yugoslav Parliament as required by the Tito–Šubašić Agreement. At the Yalta Conference, Churchill and Stalin discussed the decisions made by the AVNOJ; they agreed to demand ratification of all AVNOJ&#x27;s decisions by the future Yugoslav Constitutional Assembly.

In February 1945, the presidency of the AVNOJ concluded that the Sandžak should not be one of federal units of Yugoslavia. In turn, the Anti-Fascist Council for the People&#x27;s Liberation of Sandžak divided the region along the pre-1912 Serbia–Montenegro border and dissolved itself. The Anti-Fascist Parliament for the People&#x27;s Liberation of Serbia (ASNOS) held its first regular session between 7 and 9 April, and voted in favour of annexation of Vojvodina, Kosovo and a part of Sandžak. The People&#x27;s Liberation Council for the Kosovo-Metohija Oblasts held its first regular session between 8 and 10 July, and a corresponding body of Vojvodina met on 30 and 31 July; both bodies decided the region they represented would join Serbia. All of these decisions were confirmed at the third session of the AVNOJ in August 1945. By the end of the month, the AVNOJ discussed and decided on changes to the borders of all Yugoslav federal units based on corresponding pre-1941 and pre-1918 borders.

The third session of the AVNOJ was held in Belgrade between 7 and 26 August 1945 as a part of preparation of the Constitutional Assembly. It was again presided over by Ribar, and held in the Yugoslav Parliament building. A parliamentary election was held on 11 November and the Constitutional Assembly convened on 29 November 1945. The Assembly went on to ratify the decisions previously made by the AVNOJ.

==Legacy==
The AVNOJ resulted in a defeat of Serbian nationalism. In the pre-war Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Serbia was in a dominant position. In comparison to the pre-war situation as well as the territory held by the Kingdom of Serbia before World War I, Serbia lost Macedonia and Montenegro. The AVNOJ established Bosnia and Herzegovina as an equal member of the Yugoslav federation, establishing and confirming borders separating Serbs living in those regions and in Croatia from Serbia. Those borders are sometimes referred to as the &quot;AVNOJ borders&quot;.

In 1945, this situation caused concerns among Serbs who feared being divided among multiple Yugoslav constituent republics. In response, Tito and the Yugoslav regime employed rhetoric designed to diminish the apparent significance of the intra-Yugoslav borders. Although the AVNOJ borders were originally drawn as administrative boundaries, they gained importance with subsequent decentralisation and the breakup of Yugoslavia. Serbian irredentism across the AVNOJ borders was a contributing factor in the 1990 Serb revolt in Croatia and the 1992–1995 Bosnian War.

The second session of the AVNOJ was celebrated in post-war Yugoslavia as the birth of the country and the event was commemorated annually on 29 and 30 November as a two-day national holiday. Museums have been established in the buildings which hosted the first and the second sessions of the AVNOJ.

<text>Fair division is the problem in game theory of dividing a set of resources among several people who have an entitlement to them so that each person receives their due share. That problem arises in various real-world settings such as division of inheritance, partnership dissolutions, divorce settlements, electronic frequency allocation, airport traffic management, and exploitation of Earth observation satellites. It is an active research area in mathematics, economics (especially social choice theory), and dispute resolution. The central tenet of fair division is that such a division should be performed by the players themselves, without the need for external arbitration, as only the players themselves really know how they value the goods.

The archetypal fair division algorithm is divide and choose. It demonstrates that two agents with different tastes can divide a cake such that each of them believes that he got the best piece. The research in fair division can be seen as an extension of this procedure to various more complex settings.

There are many different kinds of fair division problems, depending on the nature of goods to divide, the criteria for fairness, the nature of the players and their preferences, and other criteria for evaluating the quality of the division.

== Things that can be divided ==

Formally, a fair division problem is defined by a set formula_1 (often called &quot;the cake&quot;) and a group of formula_2 players. A division is a partition of formula_1 into formula_2 disjoint subsets: formula_5, one subset per player.

The set formula_1 can be of various types:
* formula_1 may be a finite set of indivisible items, for example: formula_8, such that each item should be given entirely to a single person.
* formula_1 may be an infinite set representing a divisible resource, for example: money, or a cake. Mathematically, a divisible resource is often modeled as a subset of a real space, for example, the section [0,1] may represent a long narrow cake, that has to be cut into parallel pieces. The unit disk may represent an apple pie.

Additionally, the set to be divided may be:
* homogeneous – such as money, where only the amount matters, or
* heterogeneous – such as a cake that may have different ingredients, different icings, etc.

Finally, it is common to make some assumptions about whether the items to be divided are:
* goods – such as a car or a cake, or
* bads – such as house chores.

Based on these distinctions, several general types of fair division problems have been studied:
* Fair item assignment – dividing a set of &quot;indivisible and heterogeneous&quot; goods.
* Fair resource allocation – dividing a set of &quot;divisible and homogeneous&quot; goods. A special case is fair division of a single homogeneous resource.
* Fair cake-cutting – dividing a &quot;divisible, heterogeneous good&quot;. A special case is when the cake is a circle; then the problem is called fair pie-cutting.
* Fair chore division – dividing a &quot;divisible, heterogeneous bad.&quot;

Combinations and special cases are also common:
* Rental harmony (aka the housemates problem) – dividing a set of &quot;indivisible heterogeneous goods&quot; (e.g., rooms in an apartment), and simultaneously a &quot;homogeneous divisible bad&quot; (the rent on the apartment).
* Fair river sharing – dividing waters flowing in an international river among the countries along its stream.
* Fair random assignment – dividing lotteries over divisions – is especially common when allocating indivisible goods.

== Definitions of fairness ==

Most of what is normally called a fair division is not considered so by the theory because of the use of arbitration. This kind of situation happens quite often with mathematical theories named after real life problems. The decisions in the Talmud on entitlement when an estate is bankrupt reflect the development of complex ideas regarding fairness. However, they are the result of legal debates by rabbis rather than divisions according to the valuations of the claimants.

According to the subjective theory of value, there cannot be an objective measure of the value of each item. Therefore, &quot;objective fairness&quot; is not possible, as different people may assign different values to each item. Empirical experiments on how people define the concept of fairness have given inconclusive results.

Therefore, most current research on fairness focuses on concepts of &quot;subjective fairness&quot;. Each of the formula_2 people is assumed to have a personal, subjective &quot;utility function&quot; or &quot;value function&quot;, formula_11, which assigns a numerical value to each subset of formula_1. Often the functions are assumed to be normalized, so that every person values the empty set as 0 (formula_13 for all i), and the entire set of items as 1 (formula_14 for all i) if the items are desirable, and -1 if the items are undesirable. Examples are:
* If formula_1 is the set of indivisible items {piano, car, apartment}, then Alice may assign a value of 1/3 to each item, which means that each item is important to her just the same as any other item. Bob may assign the value of 1 to the set {car, apartment}, and the value 0 to all other sets except X; this means that he wants to get only the car and the apartment together; the car alone or the apartment alone, or each of them together with the piano, is worthless to him.
* If formula_1 is a long narrow cake (modeled as the interval [0,1]), then, Alice may assign each subset a value proportional to its length, which means that she wants as much cake as possible, regardless of the icings. Bob may assign value only to subsets of [0.4, 0.6], for example, because this part of the cake contains cherries and Bob only cares about cherries.

Based on these subjective value functions, there are a number of widely used criteria for a fair division. Some of these conflict with each other but often they can be combined. The criteria described here are only for when each player is entitled to the same amount:
* A proportional division means that every player gets at least their due share &quot;according to their own value function&quot;. For instance if three people divide up a cake, each gets at least a third by their own valuation, i.e. each of the &quot;n&quot; people gets a subset of &quot;formula_1&quot; which he values as at least 1/&quot;n&quot; of the total value:
** formula_18 for all i.
* A super-proportional division is one where each player receives strictly more than 1/&quot;n.&quot; (Such a division exists only if the players have different valuations.):
** formula_19 for all &quot;i&quot;.
* An envy-free division guarantees that no-one will want somebody else&#x27;s share more than their own, i.e. every person values their own share at least as much as all other shares:
** formula_20 for all i and j.
* A group-envy-free division guarantees that no subset of agents envies another subset of the same size; this is a stronger condition than envy-freeness.
* An equitable division means every player’s valuation of their own slice is equal, i.e. each receives equal value, or “experiences equal happiness”. This is a difficult aim as players need not be truthful if asked their valuation.
** formula_21 for all i and j.
* An exact division (aka consensus division) is one where all players agree on the value of each share:
** formula_22 for all i and j.

All the above criteria assume that the participants have equal entitlements. If different participants have different entitlements (e.g., in a partnership where each partner invested a different amount), then the fairness criteria should be adapted accordingly. See proportional cake-cutting with different entitlements.

== Additional requirements ==
In addition to fairness, it is sometimes desired that the division be Pareto optimal, i.e., no other allocation would make someone better off without making someone else worse off. The term efficiency comes from the economics idea of the efficient market. A division where one player gets everything is optimal by this definition so on its own this does not guarantee even a fair share. See also efficient cake-cutting and the price of fairness.

In the real world people sometimes have a very accurate idea of how the other players value the goods and they may care very much about it. The case where they have complete knowledge of each other&#x27;s valuations can be modeled by game theory. Partial knowledge is very hard to model. A major part of the practical side of fair division is the devising and study of procedures that work well despite such partial knowledge or small mistakes.

An additional requirement is that the fair division procedure be strategyproof, i.e. it should be a dominant strategy for the participants to report their true valuations. This requirement is usually very hard to satisfy, especially in combination with fairness and Pareto-efficiency. As a result, it is often weakened to incentive compatibility, which only requires players to report their true valuations if they behave according to a specified solution concept.

== Procedures ==

A fair division procedure lists actions to be performed by the players in terms of the visible data and their valuations. A valid procedure is one that guarantees a fair division for every player who acts rationally according to their valuation. Where an action depends on a player&#x27;s valuation the procedure is describing the strategy a rational player will follow. A player may act as if a piece had a different value but must be consistent. For instance if a procedure says the first player cuts the cake in two equal parts then the second player chooses a piece, then the first player cannot claim that the second player got more.

What the players do is:
* Agree on their criteria for a fair division
* Select a valid procedure and follow its rules

It is assumed the aim of each player is to maximize the minimum amount they might get, or in other words, to achieve the maximin.

Procedures can be divided into &quot;discrete&quot; vs. &quot;continuous&quot; procedures. A discrete procedure would for instance only involve one person at a time cutting or marking a cake. Continuous procedures involve things like one player moving a knife and the other saying &quot;stop&quot;. Another type of continuous procedure involves a person assigning a value to every part of the cake.

For a list of fair division procedures, see :Category:Fair division protocols.

No finite protocol (even if unbounded) can guarantee an envy-free division of a cake among three or more players, if each player is to receive a single connected piece. However, this result applies only to the model presented in that work and not for cases where, for example, a mediator has full information of the players&#x27; valuation functions and proposes a division based on this information.

== Extensions ==
Recently, the model of fair division has been extended from individual agents to &quot;families&quot; (pre-determined groups) of agents. See fair division among groups.

== History ==

According to Sol Garfunkel, the cake-cutting problem had been one of the most important open problems in 20th century mathematics, when the most important variant of the problem was finally solved with the Brams-Taylor procedure by Steven Brams and Alan Taylor in 1995.

Divide and choose&#x27;s origins are undocumented. The related activities of bargaining and barter are also ancient. Negotiations involving more than two people are also quite common, the Potsdam Conference is a notable recent example.

The theory of fair division dates back only to the end of the second world war. It was devised by a group of Polish mathematicians, Hugo Steinhaus, Bronisław Knaster and Stefan Banach, who used to meet in the Scottish Café in Lvov (then in Poland). A proportional (fair division) division for any number of players called &#x27;last-diminisher&#x27; was devised in 1944. This was attributed to Banach and Knaster by Steinhaus when he made the problem public for the first time at a meeting of the Econometric Society in Washington, D.C., on 17 September 1947. At that meeting he also proposed the problem of finding the smallest number of cuts necessary for such divisions.

For the history of envy-free cake-cutting, see
envy-free cake-cutting.

== In popular culture ==
* The 17-animal inheritance puzzle involves the fair division of 17 camels (or elephants, or horses) into the proportions 1/2, 1/3, and 1/9. It is a popular mathematical puzzle, often claimed to have an ancient origin, but its first documented publication was in 18th-century Iran.
* In &quot;Numb3rs&quot; season 3 episode &quot;One Hour&quot;, Charlie talks about the cake-cutting problem as applied to the amount of money a kidnapper was demanding.
* Hugo Steinhaus wrote about a number of variants of fair division in his book &quot;Mathematical Snapshots&quot;. In his book he says a special three-person version of fair division was devised by G. Krochmainy in Berdechów in 1944 and another by Mrs L Kott.
* Martin Gardner and Ian Stewart have both published books with sections about the problem. Martin Gardner introduced the chore division form of the problem. Ian Stewart has popularized the fair division problem with his articles in &quot;Scientific American&quot; and &quot;New Scientist&quot;.
* A &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot; strip is based on the cake-cutting problem.
* In the Israeli movie Saint Clara, a Russian immigrant asks an Israeli math teacher, how a circular cake can be divided fairly among 7 people? His answer is to make 3 straight cuts through its middle, making 8 equal pieces. Since there are only 7 people, one piece should be discarded, in the spirit of communism.

<text>Rainer Schüttler (; born 25 April 1976) is a German former professional tennis player. Schüttler was the runner-up at the 2003 Australian Open and a semifinalist at the 2008 Wimbledon Championships. He won an Olympic silver medal in doubles at the 2004 Athens Olympics, and achieved a career-high ranking of world No. 5 in April 2004.

==Early life==
He began playing tennis at the age of nine. He resides in Switzerland.

==Career==

===2003–2009===
In 2003, Schüttler became the first German since Boris Becker in 1989 to advance to the fourth round at all Grand Slam tournaments. He became the first German to reach a Grand Slam final, at the Australian Open, since Michael Stich was the runner-up at Roland Garros in 1996. En route to the final, which he lost in straight sets to Andre Agassi, he defeated Andy Roddick who would end the season as world No 1.

In 2004, Schüttler reached his first career ATP Masters Series final in Monte Carlo by beating Gustavo Kuerten in the first round, Lleyton Hewitt in the third round, Tim Henman in the quarterfinal and Carlos Moyá in the semifinal. In the final, he lost to Guillermo Coria. That week, he would reach a career-high ranking of No. 5. Schüttler won a silver medal for Germany in men&#x27;s doubles with partner Nicolas Kiefer at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. 2004 was the sixth straight year in which he finished in the ATP top 50.

Schüttler reached his first career semifinal at Wimbledon by beating Santiago Ventura, James Blake, Guillermo García López, Janko Tipsarević, and Arnaud Clément 6–3, 5–7, 7–6, 6–7, 8–6. His match with Clément was over five hours, completed in two days to reach the semifinals, in which Schuettler saved a match point at 6–5 down in the fifth set. He was defeated by eventual champion Rafael Nadal 1–6, 6–7, 4–6. His achievement was a big surprise, since he entered the tournament ranked 94th and with a streak of 13 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments without making it past the second round.

His 2009 season Schüttler started off at the Chennai Open, beating Prakash Amritraj 6–2, 4–6, 6–1. In the second round, he beat Simon Greul 6–4, 6–2, and in the quarterfinals Björn Phau, 6–2, 7–5. Unfortunately Schuettler had to withdraw from his semifinal match against Somdev Devvarman because of a wrist injury. He also withdrew from the tournament in Sydney. At the Australian Open, he was seeded 30th but lost in the first round to Israeli Dudi Sela 1–6, 6–2, 6–4, 6–4. He also participated in the doubles with Lu Yen-hsun, but they were defeated by Łukasz Kubot and Oliver Marach. In the first round in Rotterdam, he lost to Mario Ančić. He played the Open 13 in Marseille, defeating Laurent Recouderc in the first round 6–1, 6–4.

He competed at the ARAG World Team Cup in Germany, helping his country reach the final, where they lost to Serbia.

In the second round at Wimbledon, though seeded 18th, he was upset by Dudi Sela, 7–6, 6–3, 6–2.
===2010–2011===
He reached the second round of the Australian Open defeating Sam Querrey in four sets. However he lost to Feliciano López in four sets, too. At the French Open, he again suffered a first-round exit, this time against Guillermo García López in straight sets. He reached the semifinal of the Aegon Championships at the Queens Club in London but lost to Sam Querrey in three sets 7–6, 5–7, 3–6. Despite his good form he was defeated by Denis Istomin in the second round of Wimbledon in five sets. At the quarterfinal of the Countrywide Classic in Los Angeles, Schüttler could not manage to close out the match against Querrey despite serving for it at 5–4 and 6–5 in the deciding set.
He was knocked out in the first round of the US Open losing to Benoît Paire.
At the Thailand Open in Bangkok, Schüttler beat Ricardo Mello in round one for a second round berth against Ernests Gulbis. He lost 6–7, 7–6, 4–6 in a close match.

In 2010, Schüttler and his former Davis Cup companion Alexander Waske founded the Schüttler Waske Tennis-University, a tennis academy for professional tennis players.

Schüttler started the tour at the Qatar Open where he confronted Teymuraz Gabashvili in the singles, but lost 3–5, 6–7. He also played doubles with Guillermo García López confronting Marco Chiudinelli and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, to whom they lost 1–6, 2–6. At the Australian Open, he played ninth seed Fernando Verdasco in the first round, but lost 1–6, 3–6, 2–6. He then played several Challenger series tournaments. At Wimbledon, he defeated Thomaz Bellucci in the first round, but lost to Feliciano López in the second 6–7, 7–6, 2–6, 2–6.

Schüttler officially retired in October 2012.

<doc id="669919" wikidata="Q790075" url="?curid=669919" title="Avala">
<text>Avala (, ) is a mountain in Serbia, overlooking Belgrade. It is situated in the south-eastern corner of the city and provides a great panoramic view of Belgrade, Vojvodina and Šumadija, as the surrounding area on all sides is mostly lowlands. It stands at above sea level, which means that it enters the locally defined mountain category just by .

== Location ==

Avala is located south-east of downtown Belgrade. The entire area of the mountain belongs to the Belgrade City area, the majority of it being in the municipality of Voždovac, with the eastern slopes being in the municipality of Grocka, and the southernmost extension in the municipality of Sopot. It is possible that in the future the entire area of Avala would create a separate municipality of Belgrade, named Avalski Venac.

== Geography ==

Avala is a low type of the Pannonian island mountain, though it is actually the northernmost mountain in Šumadija. Until 600,000 years ago, when the surrounding low areas were flooded by the inner Pannonian Sea, Avala was an island, just as the neighboring mountains (Kosmaj, Fruška Gora, etc.), thus earning its geographical classification. However, Avala remains an &quot;island mountain&quot; as the area around it, Pinosava plateau of the northern Low Šumadija, is low and mostly flat. In the north it extends into the woods of Stepin Lug.

The mountain is built of serpentinite, limestone and magmatic rocks, which are injected in the shape of cone (laccolith). Other peaks include Ladne vode (), Zvečara (), Sakinac (). The Avala had deposits of ores, most notably lead and mercury&#x27;s ore of cinnabarite and mining activities which can be traced to the pre-Antiquity times. Other metals mined on the mountain include silver, gold and zinc. At the Šuplja Stena localities, seven quartz-carbonate veins with minerals and cinnabarite ore were discovered (Šuplja Stena, Dževerov Kamen, Dževerov Potok, Rupine, Kamenik-Spomenik, Kamenik and Prečica), with 13 additional between Šuplja Stena and Topčiderka river.

Avala is also a location where the mineral avalite, named after the mountain, was found. A greenish mineral, chromian, magnesian or potassic alumosilicate (variety of the mineral illite), it was discovered by Serbian chemist Sima Lozanić who established its formula. Optically examined by the Israeli mineralogist Tamir Grodek who classified it as a member of the mica mineral group.

On the southern slopes, in the area of Ripanj, the closed &quot;Tešićev Majdan&quot; (&quot;Tešić Quarry&quot;) is located. The stone pit was privately owned, but was confiscated by the state after World War II and stopped operating before 1960. In the process of restitution after 2000, the quarry was returned to the surviving owners, but they live abroad so the quarry is still not operational. It is the only known location of kersantite in Serbia, a rare type of greenish granite. For decades, kersantite was used for Belgrade buildings. Features built with this stone include the fountain between the Novi Dvor and Stari Dvor, the bordure of the Hotel Bristol, Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, pedestal of the Play of Black Horses statues in front of the House of the National Assembly of Serbia and buildings of Belgrade Cooperative, Elementary School King Petar I, Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel and Main Post Office Building. As the buildings began to deteriorate over time, city authorities showed interest in the quarry, not only for the repairs but also for future construction. For now, when some deteriorated kersantite feature has to be replaced, the artificial stone is used (as in the case of the pedestal of the Play of Black Horses). Geologists suggested to the city to obtain the ownership over the land on which the pit is located and to reopen it. The Belgrade City government announced in 2012 that it will unilaterally explore the pit until it gets reopened and inspected it in 2013. Large amounts of already cut kersantite were found. Locals have been illegally extracting the stone and crushing it to use as road cover. After the political change in Belgrade in late 2013, the motion was dropped.

On the mountain itself, there are several springs, of which Sakinac is best known. Despite being the only mountain in the area, Avala is not a source of many rivers. The Topčiderka river, originating in the woods of Lipovička šuma on the south-west, flows on the western slopes of Avala, while the river Bolečica flows on the eastern slopes. Other minor flows include the Vranovac, a tributary to the Bolečica. A small artificial lake near the village of Pinosava was created on the western slope of the mountain. The settlements in the area are notorious for problems with shortages of drinking water during summer.

== Wildlife ==
=== Protection ===
The mountain has been protected since 1859 as a natural monument, or, by the modern standards, &quot;sight of the exquisite values&quot;. That year, Serbian ruling prince Miloš Obrenović issued an order for the Avala to get fenced and protected that way. He also banned construction of houses on the mountain itself.

In the early 20th century, plans were made for further forestation of the mountain. In his last visit to Serbia in 1903, Austro-Hungarian naturalist Felix Philipp Kanitz noted that the mountain would become &quot;another exceptional excursion area&quot;, after the Topčider park. Remains of the medieval Žrnov were removed in 1934 to make way for the Monument to the Unknown Hero. The destruction of Žrnov, which was demolished with dynamite, caused massive discontent among the citizens of Belgrade. In the period of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the mountain was declared a national park, in 1936. In 1946, by the ukaz of the Presidium of the National Assembly of Serbia, Avala was reduced to the status of the &quot;public property of general benefit&quot; and placed under direct management of the Government of Serbia.

Despite being officially protected for almost 150 years, it was only in 2007 that preservation plans for the mountain were made. That way, Avala entered a circle of protected green areas of Belgrade, which also included the mountain of Kosmaj, the island of Veliko Ratno Ostrvo and the woods of Stepin Lug, with the forests of Košutnjak and Topčider to be added next. Protected areas of Avala spread over 

Some areas within the mountain are additionally protected., including the &quot;Complex of mountain beech, oak, maple and elm&quot;, which is in the first level of protection. It is located in the valley of the Vranovica stream, close to the &quot;Čarapićev Brest&quot; visitors&#x27; complex.

In early September 2020, unknown persons began clearing the field in the protected downhill of Avala. The field was a recorded habitat of Caspian whipsnake. Illegal construction of the complex of houses, without any permits, began in January 2021. Inspections closed it, but the construction continued before it was halted. Demolition of the complex began in August 2022.

=== Plant life ===

Avala is known for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are protected by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of laburnum, box tree, black broom, common holly and martagon lily. The area is also abundant in medicinal herbs, like the early-purple orchid and belladonna. Almost 70% of Avala is forested, or . Thus, the meadow plant communities are rare. Other protected plant species include common yew and oregano. High woods mostly consist of durmast oak, Turkey oak, hornbeam, beech, linden, black pine, black locust and other trees.

=== Animal life ===

Almost 100 species of birds live on Avala, including strictly protected Eurasian sparrowhawk, European honey buzzard and European green woodpecker. Total of 21 bird species is protected. Other species include common buzzard, stock dove, common kestrel, and Eurasian scops owl.

A section of the mountain is organized as a game hunting ground.

== Name ==
In the Middle Ages, the town of Žrnov or &quot;Avalski Grad&quot; (Avala town) was located on top of Avala. In 1442. it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, which built a new town in Žrnov&#x27;s place as a counter-fortress to the Belgrade city fort, and renamed it &quot;havale&quot;, which originally comes from Arabic and means &quot;obstacle&quot; or &quot;shelter&quot;.

== Human history ==
=== Mining ===
Archeologist Miloje Vasić believed that the vast mines of cinnabarite (mercury-sulfide) on Avala were crucial for the development of the Vinča culture, on the banks of the Danube circa 5700 BC. Settlers of Vinča apparently melted cinnabarite and used it in metallurgy. Mining was active on the mountain at 3000 BC. However, it is still contested when people began mining on Avala, from the Neolithic, to the earnest mining by the Celtic Scordisci, prior to Roman conquest. There are three major mines, Šuplja Stena, Crveni Breg and Ciganlija, the first being the most explored.

Vasić also claimed that Vinča hosted a Ionian trade colony from the Aegean around 6000 BC, and that Ionian seamen discovered primitive mine in Šuplja Stena. The Ionians continued to mine cinnabarite and with their final departure from Vinča, the mine stoppe working until being partially revived by the Celts. Pots with mercury were discovered in Šuplja Stena, but not the smelting artefacts or slag. A vast number of potteries discovered in Vinča was internally glazed with cinnabarite, with some quartz and phyllosilicates. Examination showed that it matches materials from Avala. Vinča developed c.5700 BC, Vladimir Milojević claim the production for certain from 2000 BC to 750 BC without being able to say when the mining began. Remains from both the Neolithic and the last Ice Age are also discovered in the cave.

It is still debated whether Šuplja Stena is a natural cave or was completely dug for the mining purposes. Remains of the Neanderthal culture were discovered in it. In his 1943 &quot;Prehistoric mine Šuplja Stena on Avala hill near Belgrade (Serbia)&quot;, Vladimir Milojčić said that the &quot;cave is old as Avala&quot;, formed by the volcanic activity and elevation of the terrain. The cave was first used by the wild animals and later by the prehistoric peoples, with animal and human remains, and prehistoric mining artefacts have been discovered. However, geographer Dragan Petrović in his work on the caves of Šumadija, lists caves on the present Belgrade&#x27;s territory, but makes no mention of Šuplja Stena.

In Medieval Serbia mining on Avala began in c.1420, after the Law on mines was issued by the Despot Stefan Lazarević in 1412. In this period, the cinnabarite was used for fresco paintings and was exported to Greece. Mining activities ceased by the 1960s, when the last two mines, Šuplja Stena and Crveni Breg, were closed. Šuplja Stena (&quot;Hollow Boulder&quot;) was a mercury mine while in Crveni Breg (&quot;Red Hill&quot;), lead, zinc, silver and gold were extracted. Crveni Breg was closed in 1953 and has traces of the usage from the Roman period. It has seven levels, out of which four are flooded, and the stalactites are being formed inside. By 2009 the upper level was prepared for visitors, having been cleaned and lighted for some , but the project of turning it into a tourist attraction failed.

The survey of the Crveni Breg began in 1870, and the mine was opened in 1886. Lead, zinc and silver were mined. It was intermittently operational till 1901 when it was purchased by the Belgian company from the previous Serbian owners. Operational again from 1902, it was sold to the French owners in 1906. It worked until 1941, and in this period 18,800 tons of ore was extracted. It was reopened in 1948 and closed in 1953. 55,000 tons of ore was extracted in this period, containing lead, zinc, silver, gold and copper. Along the road to Mladenovac there is the Ciganlija mine, with numerous smaller horizontal pits covered with overgrowth. Next to the mine is Zavljak stream, where remains of the slag dated to Antiquity were discovered. The slag contains lead, zinc, copper and silver.

The ore in Šuplja Stena was rediscovered in 1882, and in 1883 survey began with digging of the &quot;Jerina&quot; horizontal pit. By 1886, horizontal pit &quot;Prečica&quot; with smelters, was also finished. During this period, numerous pits and shafts were dug, with being dug only in 1891. From 1884 to 1889 it was majority owned by Đorđe Vajfert, when he sold it to an English firm, but continued to manage works. The ore was exported to Vienna, London and China. Though officially closed in 1893, the mine was extracting ore only from 1887 to 1891. From 1889 to 1890 some 30 tons of mercury was sold. The survey of Šuplja Stena was continued in 1910 and, with interruptions, lasted until 1959, while the preparatory works for the reopening began in 1967. Smelters was built, the production continued in 1968 and until spring 1972 when it was finally closed, the mine produced 80 tons of mercury. Mine in Šuplja Stena is considered one of the best explored one, in geological, chemical, mineralogical and mining sense.

=== World War II and later ===

Avala was a key point during the Belgrade Offensive in October 1944, a fighting for the liberation of Belgrade in World War II. Germans halted their mechanized units along the Smederevo road, at Mali Mokri Lug, continued equipped with the light weapons and spread over Avala. German units were commanded by lieutenant general Walter Stettner, who was killed during the battle. Germans also had a 7th SS division at the mountain, but after the joint attack of Yugoslav Partisans and Red Army, Belgrade was liberated on 20 October 1944.

In 1965, a Avala TV Tower was constructed, one of the tallest structures in the Balkans, by the architects Uglješa Bogunović, Slobodan Janjić and M. Krstić. It had a restaurant look-out on . The tower was destroyed during the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999. Its total reconstruction began in 2006 and was officially opened at a ceremony on 21 April 2010. The new tower is almost the exact replica of the destroyed one, including the unique three-feet base. Belgrade&#x27;s General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) for the 2001–2021 period defines the mountain as a sports and recreation area.

During the 1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak, Avala functioned as a quarantine. The patients were first placed in the mountaineering camp &quot;Čarapićev Brest&quot;, which was adapted into the ad-hoc hospital. The patients were later relocated closer to the main road, in the &quot;1000 Ruža&quot; motel.

The 1st Air Defense Missile Battalion, one of the &quot;Neva&quot; battalions of the 250th Air Defense Missile Brigade, is located in Zuce, on the eastern slopes of Avala.

=== Settlements ===

Settlements near the mountain are not much populous. They include Ripanj (on the south, the largest one, with a population of 10,084 by the 2022 census of population), Pinosava (on the west, 3,239), Zuce (on the north-east, 1,915), Beli Potok (on the north, 3,717), all in the municipality of Voždovac, and Vrčin (on the east, 8,601), in the municipality of Grocka.

=== Administration ===

A movement for creation of the new Belgrade&#x27;s municipality called Avalski Venac originated in 1996. A motion for the recreation of the municipality of Ripanj appeared in 2002. The idea was to split municipality of Voždovac of its distant, suburban settlements in the area of the Avala: Ripanj, Beli Potok, Pinosava and Zuce. Later, a motion for Vrčin to split from the municipality of Grocka and creation of a joint sub-Avalan municipality also appeared. If created, the new municipality would have a population of 27,556 in 2022. In September 2007 an official motion was started by the municipality of Voždovac to create this new municipality, which would also include Resnik from the municipality of Rakovica Supported by the local administration headed by the Democratic Party at the time, it was blocked by the members of the same party on the city level. It was also proposed by the political party G17 Plus in 2010 and Nova Stranka in 2015. Coalition Moramo, during the April 2022 campaign for the local elections in Belgrade, favored formation of the municipality, but also of several others.

== Transportation ==

Avala is well connected with Belgrade and other parts of Serbia via roads, highway and railroads.

&quot;Avalski drum&quot; (&quot;Avala road&quot;) is an extension of the Boulevard of the Liberation, which directly connects the mountain to downtown Belgrade (via neighborhoods of Selo Rakovica, Jajinci, Banjica, Voždovac, Autokomanda, Karađorđev Park and Slavija). On the mountain, &quot;Avalski drum&quot; divides in three:
* one section is a circular road which goes to the top of the mountain.
* second section continues to the south-west, through Ripanj, Lipovička Šuma and Barajevo, and makes a connection to the major road in the western Serbia, &quot;Ibarska magistrala&quot;.
* third section goes south-east, parallel to the highway, through Trešnja and Ralja and further to the south and east (where it meets the highway).
Sub-Avalan settlements are directly connected to Belgrade by the bus lines of the city&#x27;s public transportation, with terminus in the Belgrade&#x27;s neighborhood of Trošarina.

The Belgrade–Niš highway, a section of one of the major European roads, European route E75, runs east of the mountain, through Vrčin. North of the mountain runs &quot;Kružni put&quot;, the most important road in the southern outskirts of Belgrade, which connects all the southern sections of the city. It is also a projected route of the future Belgrade beltway which would continue through the Bolečica river valley and the projected Vinča-Omoljica bridge over the Danube into Vojvodina.

Railroads also run on both sides of the mountain. Eastern branch is a section of the Belgrade-Niš railroad. It runs through the tunnel under the Avala at Beli Potok and then through Včrin. Western branch runs through Ripanj and the long &quot;Ripanj tunnel&quot; (though not under the Avala), and continues into western Serbia and further into Montenegro, as part of the Belgrade–Bar railway.

== Tourism ==

Avala is a traditional picnic resort for Belgraders, but its capacities are not being used much. In 1984 number of tourists was only 15,700 despite over 1.5 million of inhabitants in Belgrade. Some attractions and capacities on the mountain include:
* Šuplja Stena, a former very popular children&#x27;s resort, located on the mountain&#x27;s wind rose; after the 1990s it turned into a residential place refugees from the Yugoslav Wars but was reconstructed and reopened in 2012;
* Avala Tower, landmark TV Tower that was destroyed during the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia, later rebuilt in 2010; In June 2017 the tourist complex was opened at the base of the tower. It includes, among other facilities, a restaurant, ethno-gallery, souvenir shop, sports fields and outdoor gym.
* Weekend-settlement on the southern slopes;
* Motel &quot;1000 Ruža&quot; in Beli Potok; now adapted into the 3-star hotel;
* Hotel &quot;Avala&quot;; built in 1928 by the Russian architect Viktor Lukomsky. Russian sculptor Aleksandr Zagrodnyuk sculpted two sphinx which are located at the hotel&#x27;s north side, on the staircase to the hotel&#x27;s terrace. The hotel was privatised in 2005, but in 2007 it was declared a cultural monument;
* Trešnja resort, in the southernmost extension of the mountain;
* Mountaineering camp of &quot;Čarapićev brest&quot;; Projected by the architect Slobodan Mihajlović in the 1960s, on the northern slopes of the Avala, above Beli Potok. It was renovated in 2003;
* Mountaineering camp of &quot;Mitrovićev dom&quot;. It was made of wood and stone and named (“Mitrović Home”) after dr Dušan Špirta Mitrović, a medical doctor and volunteer on the Salonika front. In 1981 it was declared a cultural monument but in 2014 it burned to the ground in the fire. In 2016–17 it was reconstructed to look exactly the same way it looked before the fire.
* One of only three officially designated campsites in Belgrade by 2018 is located on the mountain. A small camping ground, it is situated on the slopes in the Ripanj section.
* Hiking trail &quot;Sakinac&quot;, fully revitalized in September 2020. Formerly paved with asphalt concrete, it is covered with the crushed stone from Struganik. It connects the Sakinac water spring to the &quot;Mitrovićev dom&quot;, on the top of the mountain. There, it forks in two, one end reaching the tower while the other leads to the church.

=== Monuments on Avala ===

Special attractions of the Avala are several monuments. They include:

* Monument to the Unknown Hero – dedicated to the unknown Serbian soldier from World War I; sculptured by Ivan Meštrović in the form of mausoleum with 8 caryatides (columns shaped like female figures, in this case each one representing a woman from a different historical region of Yugoslavia), it was completed in 1938. An earlier monument was erected in 1915 at the location by the German soldiers, on the orders of Field marshal August von Mackensen.
* Monument to the Soviet war veterans – dedicated to the members of the Soviet military delegation which died in an airplane crash on the Avala on October 19, 1964. They were flying to Belgrade for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade in World War II, October 20, 1944, as Red Army forces participated in the expulsion of Germans. Among those killed in the crash were Marshal Sergey Semyonovich Biryuzov, chief of the General Staff and first deputy defense minister of the Soviet Union and General Vladimir Ivanovich Zhdanov. The monument was sculptured by Jovan Kratohvil.
* Memorial Park – dedicated to the victims of the World War II
* Monument to Vasa Čarapić – dedicated to Vasa Čarapić, one of the leaders of the First Serbian Uprising in 1804 and liberator of Belgrade from the Turks, built in Beli Potok, his birthplace, near the mountaineers home &quot;Čarapićev brest&quot;. It was sculptured in 1991 by Dušan Nikolić.

=== Churches ===

Small church dedicated to the Saint Despot Stefan Lazarević was built in the immediate vicinity of the Avala Tower and Monument to the Unknown Hero. The foundations were consecrated by the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Irinej, in 2015. Made of white pine and designed by deacon Miroslav Nikolić, it covers only . The bell tower, built next to the church, is also made of wood. The church contains &quot;epitrachelion&quot; of Saint Nectarios of Aegina and pillow of Saint Petka.

=== Mountaineering camp ===

Annually, from July 1 until July 10, a traditional camp of Serbian mountaineers is held on the Avala. Among other mountaineering activities, there are competitions in:
* Orienteering
* Climbing (on an outdoor Climbing wall)
* Mountain biking
* Mountain running

=== Ski center ===

The first skiing competition in Yugoslavia was held on Avala in 1929. In 1934, Belgrade was declared a national ski center, and by 1936 there were ski pistes and a ski jumping hill. A special bus line was organized from Slavija to the ski structures on the mountain.

The first local, Serbian competition after World War II was also held here, in 1946. The usual route was the one starting at the logger&#x27;s cabin and ending all the way to the foothills above Ripanj. The tracks were quite crude. Despite low altitude, construction of the ski resort, with sports and recreational venues and a cable car have been proposed in 1994 and 2005. In October 2018, city government announced plans to set a long piste. The construction of the complex, which is planned to be operational over the entire year thanks to the artificial snowing system (skiing specifically from November to February), should start in 2019. The piste will start in the immediate vicinity of the tower and end at the logger&#x27;s cabin. Due to the altitude and the climate, the north-western slope, in the direction of Pinosava, is chosen. The track has been labeled as the &quot;blue&quot;, which means it is of and intermediate level of difficulty.

Phase I includes the construction of the piste, ski lift, training trail, snowmaking cannons, decorative lights, parking lots and special machinery. Phase II comprises the building of the bobsled on rails track, zip-line, mini golf course, artificial climbing rock, children playground and an adventure park. Projected price is €5 million. As the project includes cutting of the mountain forest, the opposition to the project amounted and no works began before 2020.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island () together with the lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island form the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The Legislative Assembly meets at Province House, which is at the intersection of Richmond and Great George Streets in Charlottetown. Bills passed by the Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor in the name of the King of Canada.

==History==
As a colony, Prince Edward Island originally had a bicameral legislature founded in 1773 with the Legislative Council of Prince Edward Island serving as the upper house and the House of Assembly as the lower house. Together they composed the 1st General Assembly of the Island of Saint John. After the name of the colony changed in 1798, the body became known as the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island.

In 1769, a British Order in Council established a new government on the British colony of St. John&#x27;s Island (present day P.E.I.). In 1770, Lieutenant Governor Walter Patterson (the island&#x27;s first Governor) arrived and appointed a Council to assist him in the administration of the island. By 1773, at the insistence of the British government, Governor Patterson summoned the island&#x27;s first assembly.

Elections for the island&#x27;s first House of Assembly were held on July 4, 1773, with 18 members being elected. Tradition has it that the first session of the island&#x27;s new assembly was held in the Crossed Keys Tavern on the corner of Queen and Dorchester Streets in Charlottetown; however, a journal entry contradicts this and indicates that it was actually held in the home of James Richardson.

In 1839, an important distinction was drawn between the executive and legislative capacities of the Legislative Council. This distinction proved to be an important step on the road to responsible government which was finally implemented in 1851.

Prior to 1893, Prince Edward Island had a bicameral system of government, consisting of a Legislative Council and a House of Assembly. These two bodies were amalgamated in 1893 to create one Legislative Assembly consisting of 30 members elected from 15 different constituencies. Each constituency returned a Councillor and an Assemblyman to the Assembly. The only change to this system of returning members to the assembly was the addition of two Members resulting from the creation of 6th Queens in 1966. In 1996, the system and the electoral map were restructured, and the province now has twenty-seven Members of the Legislative Assembly, each elected from a different constituency.

In 2015, Province House was closed for repairs and conservation work. The legislature moved to the adjacent Hon. George Coles Building, where it is expected to remain for several years.

==Composition==
The Legislative Assembly currently has 27 single-member districts and is currently the smallest provincial assembly in Canada.

Prior to the 1996 provincial election, the province was divided into 16 dual-member districts, each of which was represented by one member who held the title Assemblyman and one member who held the title Councillor. This was a holdover from the legislature&#x27;s historic bicameral structure; instead of simply abolishing its upper house as most Canadian provinces with historically bicameral legislatures did, Prince Edward Island merged the two houses in 1893. Although both members sat in the same legislative house, all voters in a district voted for the assemblyman while only landowners could vote for the councillor. Excepting the division of 5th Queens, the district that contained the capital city of Charlottetown, into two districts in 1966, these district boundaries were never adjusted for demographic or population changes.

The property qualification was discontinued in 1963, largely eliminating any practical distinction between the two roles, although the nominal titles continued to be used until the current single-member districts were introduced in 1996.

<text>William Adger Moffett (31 October 1869 – 4 April 1933) was an American admiral and Medal of Honor recipient known as the architect of naval aviation in the United States Navy.

==Biography==

Born 31 October 1869, in Charleston, South Carolina, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1890. He was the son of George Hall Moffett (1829–1875), who enlisted in the Confederate States army as a private, and was promoted for bravery on the field of battle, eventually attaining the rank of Captain and adjutant-general, Hagood&#x27;s Brigade, Twenty-fifth South Carolina Volunteers.
Moffett was on when she sailed across the Pacific and captured Guam. Ultimately ending up in the Philippines, a month after the US victory at Manila Bay, the &quot;Charleston&quot; then shelled enemy positions in support of American and Filipino troops at the Battle of Manila (1898).

Commander Moffett was the captain of the &quot;Chester&quot; during the Tampico Affair. In December 1915 Moffett received the Medal of Honor for his captaincy of the in a daring and dangerous night landing in 1914 at Veracruz, Veracruz, Mexico. (See also United States occupation of Veracruz, 1914). (See text of the Citation set forth below.)

In World War I, he was commander of the Great Lakes Naval Training Center near Chicago, where he established an aviator training program. While commanding the battleship (1918–1921) he supported the creation of a scout plane unit on the ship.

Although not himself a flyer, Moffett became known as the &quot;Air Admiral&quot; for his leadership of the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Aeronautics from its creation in 1921 with Captain Henry C. Mustin as its first Assistant Chief. In this role, he oversaw the development of tactics for naval aircraft, the introduction of the aircraft carrier, and relations with the civilian aircraft industry. A master politician, he maintained official support for naval aviation against Billy Mitchell, who favored putting all military aircraft into a separate air force. In that regard, Moffett benefited from his longstanding friendship with Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had been appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy by Woodrow Wilson in 1913.

Moffett was a strong advocate of the development of lighter-than-air craft, and lost his life when the , then the largest dirigible in the world, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean during a storm off the coast of New Jersey on 4 April 1933.

He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, alongside his wife Jeanette Whitton Moffett (1885–1958), and one of their three sons, William Adger Moffett, Jr. (1910–2001), who was also a Navy admiral.

In 2008, Moffett was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

<text>Metro Transit is the primary public transportation operator in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area of the U.S. state of Minnesota and the largest operator in the state. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The system is a division of the Metropolitan Council, the region&#x27;s metropolitan planning organization (MPO), carrying 90% to 95% of the transit riders in the region on a combined network of regular-route buses, light rail and commuter rail. The remainder of Twin Cities transit ridership is generally split among suburban &quot;opt-out&quot; carriers operating out of cities that have chosen not to participate in the Metro Transit network. The biggest opt-out providers are Minnesota Valley Transit Authority (MVTA), Maple Grove Transit and Southwest Transit (SW Transit). The University of Minnesota also operates a campus shuttle system that coordinates routes with Metro Transit services. It is considered to be one of the fastest growing mass transit networks in the US.

In 2017, buses carried about 68% of the system&#x27;s passengers. Just above 16% of ridership was concentrated on Metro Transit&#x27;s busiest route, the Green Line light rail. The region&#x27;s other light rail line, the Blue Line, fell close behind, carrying 13% of Metro Transit passengers. Nearly 2% rode the A Line arterial rapid bus line. The remaining approximately 1% rode the Northstar Commuter Rail service. In 2015, Metro Transit saw its highest yearly ridership ever, with a total of 85.8 million trips, 62.1 million (72%) of which were on buses. The remaining 23.7 million (28%) of passengers traveled on the region&#x27;s rail lines, including the then new Green Line. The single-day ridership record is 369,626, set on September 1, 2016.

Metro Transit drivers and vehicle maintenance personnel are organized through the Amalgamated Transit Union. The agency also contracts with private providers such as First Transit to offer paratransit services which operate under the Metro Mobility brand.

== History ==
The agency was established by the Minnesota State Legislature in 1967 as the Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC), with the purpose of overseeing transit planning and improvements for the region. The idea for such an agency was first floated in 1950 and gained momentum at the Legislature in 1965 when it was supported by two separate studies. The Twin Cities&#x27; primary transit operator, Twin City Lines traces its history back to the first horsecar lines in the late 19th-century. In the eclipse of public takeover, Twin City Lines had 635 buses: 75% of those were over 15 years old and 86 buses were so old that they were banned in Minneapolis. The public complained that Twin City Lines buses were too slow, uncomfortable, and lacked connection with the other seven private suburban bus companies. The 64th Legislature failed to pass the establishment of a transit commission with regulatory, planning, and other powers in 1965. The 65th Legislature established MTC two years later after overwhelming support from 23 cities and Twin City Lines itself. Originally, the bill also would have provided MTC the authority to acquire private bus companies though condemnation, but was removed after lobbying from Twin City Lines. MTC composed of nine members, eight appointed by local governments and a chair appointed by the governor. The iconic &quot;Circle T&quot; came into use shortly after its creation, becoming a regionally recognizable symbol today.
With the new commission lacking expertise themselves, MTC retained two transit consulting firms. Simpson &amp; Curtin were hired to analyze the current transit network and recommend improvements. Alan M. Voorhees &amp; Associates took on the role of developing a long-range transit plan, including rapid transit. MTC had been involved in talks with Twin City Lines about purchasing them since fall 1968. MTC was reluctant to negotiate, since they did not have condemnation powers; while Twin City Lines was also reluctant because they did not want to be condemned. In October 1969 Simpson &amp; Curtain, over two other alternatives, recommended public ownership of Twin City Lines, ridiculing them for &quot;a record of long-term neglect&quot;. The other alternatives were to subside the bus company or jawboning the company to make improvements. On September 18, 1970, MTC acquired the dilapidated Twin City Lines bus system from businessman Carl Pohlad after mounting pressure for public ownership. At 5am that morning, buses rolled out with &quot;Circle T&quot; decals applied to old buses over the night, with a long-term rebranding effort ahead. From Simpson &amp; Curtain, MTC already had a 13-point bus improvement plan, and had gained federal commitment of $9.7 million to help fund the acquisition and the first phase of the plan. MTC established a five year, $20 million program to modernize the system: kicking off the first year purchasing 93 new buses, building 135 new bus shelters, installing new bus stop signs, and the creation of a 24-hour information center. By 1975, MTC had acquired four private suburban companies, introduced 665 new buses to the fleet, and created the first highway express bus.

Shortly the acquisition of Twin City Lines, a long battle began to return rail transit to the region and efforts for additional lines continue at a snail&#x27;s pace. It would take 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) heavy rail rapid transit system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea—refusing to even look at the plan—and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for bus rapid transit in the Cities. Another system using smaller people movers was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the Saint Paul city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, light rail was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the Central Corridor, for which a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982.

In 1994, MTC became a division of the Metropolitan Council, prompting a name change to Metropolitan Council Transit Operations (MCTO). Realizing the new name was not embraced by the public, the agency rebranded itself in late 1997 to Metro Transit. The effort was to create a &quot;new name for a new beginning&quot; in a period where support for light rail transit was beginning to peak. In 1998, Hennepin County Commissioner and Hennepin County Regional Rail Authority chairman Peter McLaughlin and Congressman Martin Sabo respectively secured local and federal funding for the Hiawatha Line. A year later Governor Jesse Ventura was able to secure state funding. Light rail began operation on June 26, 2004, just over 50 years since the last regular-service streetcar ran on June 19, 1954, under Twin City Lines. Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the Northstar Line.
Metro Transit does not cover the whole Twin Cities area. Bus service in the suburbs was being cut back in the early 1980s and suburb-to-suburb service was limited (an issue that remains today). In 1986, cities and counties in the seven-county metropolitan area were given the option to run their own bus services and leave the MTC system. About 17.5% of the area which has regular route transit service is served by these six other &quot;opt out&quot; transit systems. About 5% of the system is contracted to private transit providers.

== Funding ==
Metro Transit currently receives the majority of its funding from the State Motor Vehicle Sales Tax, the State General Fund, fares and federal revenues. Metro Transit prepares an annual calendar budget, but most of its funding comes from state funds, on a July 1 biennial budget. Between 2001 and 2006, reductions in state general funds and state motor vehicle sales tax collections forced a set of service cuts, fare increases and fuel surcharges, all of which reduced ridership.

Local policy requires that one third of the system&#x27;s funding is to come from fares and current operations slightly exceed that level. Since October 1, 2008, fares on all buses and trains increased by 25 cents. Express routes cost more (on limited-stop portions) and certain eligible individuals (such as riders with disabilities) may ride for $1. Many of the fares are more expensive during rush hour periods. For instance, a rush-hour ride on an express bus costs $3.25, as opposed to $2.50 for non-rush hours.
The system does not make much use of fare zones aside from downtown zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where rides only cost $0.50. Fare transfer cards valid for 2.5 hours are available upon payment of fare. Only the Northstar commuter rail line charges fares based on distance. A number of discounted multiple-use transit pass options are available. In early 2007, the system introduced a contactless smart card (the Go-To card) for paying fares.

A second fare increase occurred in 2017. &quot;Under the new system, local fares for off-peak hours will increase from $1.75 to $2; while rides will go from $2.25 to $2.50 for peak hours. Metro Mobility users will pay $3.50 to $4.50 per ride, as well as an additional 75-cent surcharge for trips greater than 15 miles. Transit Link Dial-A-Ride fares will increase, on average, by $1.60, and include a 75-cent distance surcharge.&quot;

== METRO System ==

Metro is the system of frequent, all-day light rail and bus rapid transit lines owned by the Metropolitan Council that provide station-to-station service to the Twin Cities region. Metro Transit is the operator of both of the region&#x27;s light rail lines, the Metro Blue Line and the Metro Green Line, and the region&#x27;s bus rapid transit lines: the Metro A Line, Metro C Line, Metro D Line, Metro Orange Line, and Metro Red Line. An additional bus rapid transit line, the Metro B Line, and an extension of the Metro Green Line are currently under construction.

=== Light rail ===


The METRO Blue Line opened on June 26, 2004, as the state&#x27;s first light rail line, providing service between Hennepin Ave./Warehouse District Station and Fort Snelling Station. On December 4, 2004, service was extended to Mall of America station via Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport. As part of the Northstar Commuter Rail project, on November 14, 2009, the Blue Line was extended a few blocks north to Target Field (Metro Transit Station) to provide connections to the new commuter rail line. Current plans call for a northern extension of the Metro Blue Line to Brooklyn Park.

The METRO Green Line opened on June 14, 2014, and connects Downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota, the Midway and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of St. Paul, the State Capitol and Downtown St. Paul with light rail service. Southwest LRT is a currently under construction extension of the Green Line through the southwest suburbs to Eden Prairie. On January 14, 2021, the Metropolitan Council announced that the Southwest LRT would not be able to make its targeted opening year of 2023 due to poor soil conditions in the Kenilworth Corridor. The expected opening date was revised to 2027 the following year.

=== Arterial bus rapid transit ===

The METRO A Line, is a bus rapid transit line, that operates along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the Metro Blue Line at 46th Street Station to the Rosedale Transit Center with a connection at the METRO Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line was the first in a series of planned bus rapid transit lines that replace high ridership local routes. Service began on June 11, 2016.

The METRO C Line is a bus rapid transit line that operates along Penn Avenue and Olson Memorial Highway. The C Line connects Brooklyn Center, North Minneapolis, and Downtown Minneapolis. Service began on June 8, 2019.

The METRO D Line is a bus rapid transit line that operates along Fremont Avenue and Chicago Avenue. It connects Brooklyn Center, North Minneapolis, Downtown Minneapolis, South Minneapolis and Mall of America. Service began on December 3, 2022.

=== Highway bus rapid transit ===

The METRO Red Line is a bus rapid transit line providing connections between the Metro Blue Line at Mall of America and the southern suburb of Apple Valley. The line began service on June 22, 2013, operated by Minnesota Valley Transit Authority on behalf of the Metropolitan Council. On December 4, 2020, Metro Transit assumed all operations the Red Line.

The METRO Orange Line operates along Interstate 35W from Downtown Minneapolis to the southern suburbs, terminating in Burnsville. Transit improvements in the corridor had been discussed for decades before bus rapid transit was chosen as the preferred mode. The line began operations on December 4, 2021.

== Transitway projects in development ==
=== Metro Gold Line ===

The METRO Gold Line is a bus rapid transit line currently under construction. The route will run from Downtown Saint Paul to the east suburbs, terminating in Woodbury. It would be the first bus rapid transit line in the state to have dedicated lanes with 90% of the route traveling in these lanes. Operations are anticipated to start on March 22, 2025.

=== Metro Purple Line ===

The METRO Purple Line is a bus rapid transit line undergoing environmental analysis. The line will travel from downtown Saint Paul to White Bear Lake and 85-90% of the route will run on its own dedicated roads. The project would cost between $420-470 million and could open as soon as 2026.

=== Arterial bus rapid transit ===

There are two additional arterial bus rapid transit projects either under construction, undergoing engineering, or in the planning process.

The METRO B Line is a bus rapid transit route under construction for Lake Street, running from Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis&#x27;s Uptown neighborhood to the Snelling &amp; Dayton station of the A Line and continuing to Downtown Saint Paul along Selby Avenue. Construction began in spring of 2023 with operation expected to begin by June 2025.

The METRO E Line is a bus rapid transit route proposed for Hennepin Avenue. The route will run from the University of Minnesota through Downtown Minneapolis, Uptown Minneapolis, and Southwest Minneapolis to Southdale Center. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2024, and construction to be done by 2025.

=== Other corridors ===
In fall 2020 Metro Transit announced that they would be resuming community engagement and development of upgrading local routes to bus rapid transit lines as part of Network Next. Out of 11 corridors, three would be selected as to be upgraded after completion of the Metro E Line. All three lines would be constructed at once around 2024–2025 and would be part of the METRO network. In February 2021, it was announced that the corridors would be:
*F Line: Northtown Mall—Downtown Minneapolis via Central Avenue, currently served by Route 10.
*G Line: Little Canada Transit Center—Downtown Saint Paul—Dakota County Service Center via Rice and Robert Streets, currently served by Routes 62 and 68.
*H Line: Downtown Minneapolis—Sun Ray Transit Center via Como and Maryland Avenue, currently served by parts of Route 3, 64, and 80.

== Bus routes ==

Metro Transit operates 123 bus routes, 66 of which are local routes and 51 are express routes. An additional six bus routes are operated under contract with Maple Grove Transit. In 2012, Metro Transit buses averaged 230,575 riders per weekday. The system operates almost 900 wait shelters, including 180 reclaimed from CBS Outdoor in March 2014.

Bus routes are numbered in accordance to portions of the metropolitan area served. Bus routes that primarily serve Minneapolis are numbered 1–49, 50–59 are inner-city limited-stop routes, 60–89 primarily serve St. Paul, and route 94 is an express route that connects the core areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul via I-94. 100 series routes are primarily commuter routes connecting outlying neighborhoods of Minneapolis and St. Paul to the cities&#x27; cores, as well as the University of Minnesota. 200 series routes serve the northeast metro, 300 series the southeast, 400 series the southern Dakota and Scott County suburbs, 500 series the suburbs of Richfield, Edina, and Bloomington, 600 series the west and southwest metro, 700 series the northwest metro and 800 series serves northern Anoka County suburbs.

Three-digit route numbers are further subdivided into two groups. Routes ending in x00–x49 are typically local service bus routes connecting METRO stations, shopping areas and other local destinations, whereas those ending in x50–x99 are primarily express service routes which connect outlying suburbs and park and ride facilities to the central business districts of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Additionally, the Northstar Commuter Rail line is publicly given route number 888.

=== High Frequency Network ===
A sub-network branded as the High Frequency Network (originally spelled Hi-Frequency) was created on September 9, 2006. This network highlights sixteen routes that offer headways of 15 minutes or better during weekdays from 6 am to 7 pm and Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm. segments of Routes 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 18, 54, 64 and all of Routes 21, 63, and METRO A, C, D, Blue, Orange, and Green Lines are part of the High Frequency Network. All of Route 16 and segments of Routes 5, 19 and 84 were formerly part of the network until being replaced by METRO lines in the same corridor.

== Northstar Line ==

The Northstar Line is a commuter rail line providing service between Minneapolis and Big Lake, Minnesota, which opened on November 16, 2009. There are additional bus connections to Becker and St. Cloud, with three round-trips in the peak direction, one reverse commute round-trip on weekdays, and no weekend service. Additional service is provided on event days, such as during Twins and Vikings games. However, service is not provided on holidays.

== Facilities ==
=== Dedicated bus lanes ===
Several local transit routes travel along a dedicated transit mall in downtown Minneapolis. Nicollet Mall runs roughly south to north through downtown. An experiment to move buses off of Nicollet Mall to Hennepin Avenue in the afternoon rush hour occurred in 2005 and the results attracted mixed reviews. In 2007, 964 buses travelled through Nicollet Mall every day serving both local and express customers.

Some express routes used to travel along Nicollet Mall but starting in 2009, most express routes in downtown Minneapolis moved to the paired streets of Marquette Avenue and 2nd Avenue South on the Marq2 transit corridor. The $32 million dollar project was partly funded by the federal government under the Urban Partnership Agreement. The two-lane busways were built along the parallel roads which each travel one-way in opposite directions. The two lanes allow buses to stop at the curb to pick up customers and pass other buses in the second lane. A system of lettered gates was established, by which buses would only stop every other block along those two one-mile corridors. Some trip travel times were reduced by 10 minutes after 1,400 trips were consolidated in the corridor. NexTrip digital signs with arrival times were also added, although they weren&#x27;t functioning at the beginning of the rollout. NexTrip information has also been available through the Metro Transit website since 2008 and can be accessed with mobile web browsers. After 10 years NexTrip signs on Marquette and 2nd Avenues were upgraded with new versions that have improved connectivity, better reliability, and improved NexTrip travel time predictions.

Bus-only lanes were first introduced to Hennepin Avenue South in 2018 and became permanent after a successful trial run. The bus-only lanes were found to improve speeds and reliability of travel through the corridor. The future Metro E Line would utilize these lanes. While bus-only lanes on Hennepin Avenue are only exclusively for transit during peak periods, a 24-hour bus-only lane was added to 7th Street in downtown Minneapolis in 2021. Local and express routes use 7th Street including the Metro C Line and Metro D Line. There is a southbound bus lane on Chicago Avenue between 28th and Lake Street as well.

=== Bus-only shoulders ===
Since 1991, Metro Transit buses have been allowed to use &quot;bus-only shoulders,&quot; road shoulders to bypass traffic jams. Currently, buses are allowed to travel no more than or faster than the congested traffic in the general purpose lanes. Bus drivers must be very attentive when taking the bus onto the shoulder, since that part of the road is only about one foot wider than the buses in many cases. To help with this issue, researchers at the University of Minnesota helped rig up a bus with a lane-keep system, along with a heads-up display connected to a radar system to alert the driver of any obstacles. The technology was an adaptation of a system previously tested with drivers of snowplows and made some headlines in the early 2000s. This system will be more widely deployed under the Urban Partnership Agreement that assisted in the Marq2 project.

=== Transit centers ===
Metro Transit operates 29 transit centers, which provide connection points for bus and rail services throughout the metropolitan area.

=== Park and rides ===
Metro Transit operated service to 70 park and ride lots and ramps, with a total of 20,570 parking spaces available in 2019. Almost 12,000 spaces were used on a typical day during the 2019 survey. These lots allow commuters to park their cars for free and take buses and trains to the downtown areas to avoid traffic congestion and parking fees. A report on the region&#x27;s park and ride system, including other transit agencies, is published annually.

=== Better Bus Stops ===
After a Star Tribune investigation found mismatches between bus stops with enough riders to qualify for a bus shelter and bus shelters without enough rides to justify a shelter, Metro Transit committed to spending $5.8 million to improve shelters, with $3.26 million coming from a Federal Transit Administration &quot;Ladders of Opportunity&quot; grant. The 2014 investigation found that 460 bus stops in Metro Transit&#x27;s service area had enough riders to qualify for a shelter under the agency&#x27;s standards but did not have one, while 200 of the 801 existing shelters did not have enough riders to justify a shelter. To spend the money Metro Transit created a program called Better Bus Stops that reevaluated shelter placement guidelines. Metro Transit dedicated 10% of project funds on community outreach, which helped guide bus shelter and transit information changes at bus stops. Bus stop signs were redesigned to include more route information, and the agency made a goal of adding 150 additional shelters for a total of around 950. New shelter placement guidelines did away with different threshold for suburban and urban stops, and made the criteria based just on number of boardings and proximity to priority locations.

== Fleet ==
=== Buses ===

Metro Transit operates a fleet consisting of Gillig Low Floor 40-foot transit buses (which comprises the majority of the fleet), New Flyer D60LFR and XD60 articulated buses, and MCI D4500CT commuter coaches.

In the 2000s, most buses had a mostly white livery with a predominantly blue strip running horizontally along the side and a large white &quot;T&quot; inside a red circle on the roof. Diesel–electric hybrid buses introduced toward the end of the decade spurred new color schemes, with yellow at the front and the blue line moved above the side windows. The METRO light-rail vehicles have a different color scheme: predominantly blue and white, with yellow on each end. Metro Transit also uses vehicle wrap advertising on some buses and light rail cars, creating a different appearance.

All of the buses are handicapped-accessible, either using hydraulic lifts or a low-floor design. The Metropolitan Council also operates the Metro Mobility paratransit system for door-to-door transportation.

All Metro Transit buses and light- and heavy-rail trains have bike racks installed.

=== Rail ===
Metro Transit operates 27 Bombardier Flexity Swift vehicles on the Blue Line light rail line. There are also 64 Siemens S70 vehicles operating on both the Blue and Green Line light rail lines. Rolling stock for the Northstar Line commuter rail line consists of Bombardier BiLevel Coaches pulled by MotivePower MP36 locomotives.

<doc id="669931" wikidata="Q2842604" url="?curid=669931" title="NCAA Division I">
<text>NCAA Division I (D-I) is the highest level of intercollegiate athletics sanctioned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States, which accepts players globally. D-I schools include the major collegiate athletic powers, with large budgets, more elaborate facilities and more athletic scholarships than Division II and Division III as well as many smaller schools committed to the highest level of intercollegiate competition.

This level was previously called the University Division of the NCAA, in contrast to the lower-level College Division; these terms were replaced with numeric divisions in 1973. The University Division was renamed Division I, while the College Division was split in two; the College Division members that offered scholarships or wanted to compete against those who did became Division II, while those who did not want to offer scholarships became Division III.

For college football only, D-I schools are further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and those institutions that do not have any football program. FBS teams have more players receiving athletic scholarships than FCS teams and formerly (until 2024) had minimum game-attendance requirements. The FBS is named for its series of postseason bowl games, with various polls ranking teams after the conclusion of these games, while the FCS national champion is determined by a multi-team bracket tournament.

For the 2020–21 school year, Division I contained 357 of the NCAA&#x27;s 1,066 member institutions, with 130 in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), 127 in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and 100 non-football schools, with six additional schools in the transition from Division II to Division I. There was a moratorium on any additional movement up to D-I until 2012, after which any school that wants to move to D-I must be accepted for membership by a conference and show the NCAA it has the financial ability to support a D-I program.

==Finances==
Division I athletic programs generated $8.7 billion in revenue in the 2009–10 academic year. Men&#x27;s teams provided 55%, women&#x27;s teams 15%, and 30% was not categorized by sex or sport. Football and men&#x27;s basketball are usually a university&#x27;s only profitable sports, and are called &quot;revenue sports&quot;. From 2008 to 2012, 205 varsity teams were dropped in NCAA Division I – 72 for women and 133 for men, with men&#x27;s tennis, gymnastics and wrestling hit particularly hard.

In the Football Bowl Subdivision (130 schools in 2017), between 50 and 60 percent of football and men&#x27;s basketball programs generated positive revenues (above program expenses). However, in the Football Championship Subdivision (124 schools in 2017), only four percent of football and five percent of men&#x27;s basketball programs generated positive revenues.

In 2012, 2% of athletic budgets were spent on equipment, uniforms and supplies for male athletes at NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision school, with the median spending per-school at $742,000.

In 2014, the NCAA and the student athletes debated whether student athletes should be paid. In April, the NCAA approved students-athletes getting free unlimited meals and snacks. The NCAA stated &quot;The adoption of the meals legislation finished a conversation that began in the Awards, Benefits, Expenses and Financial Aid Cabinet. Members have worked to find appropriate ways to ensure student-athletes get the nutrition they need without jeopardizing Pell Grants or other federal aid received by the neediest student-athletes. With their vote, members of the council said they believe loosening NCAA rules on what and when food can be provided from athletics departments is the best way to address the issue.&quot;

According to the finance section of the NCAA page, &quot;The NCAA receives most of its annual revenue from two sources: television and marketing rights for the Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship and ticket sales for all championships. That money is distributed in more than a dozen ways — almost all of which directly support NCAA schools, conferences and nearly half a million student-athletes. About 60% of the NCAA&#x27;s annual revenue — around $600 million — is annually distributed directly to Division I member schools and conferences, while more than $150 million funds Division I championships&quot; (NCAA 2021).

Finances

==Football conferences==
Under NCAA regulations, all Division I conferences defined as &quot;multisport conferences&quot; must meet the following criteria:
* A total of at least seven active Division I members. However, the NCAA&#x27;s Grace Period rule (Bylaw 20.02.9.2) allows conferences to operate for up to two years with less than the minimum.
* Separate from the above, at least seven active Division 1 members that sponsor both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball.
* Sponsorship of at least 12 NCAA Division I sports.
* Minimum of six men&#x27;s sports, with the following additional restrictions:
** Men&#x27;s basketball is a mandatory sport, and at least seven members must sponsor that sport.
** Non-football conferences must sponsor at least two men&#x27;s team sports other than basketball.
** At least six members must sponsor five men&#x27;s sports other than basketball, including either football or two other team sports.
* Minimum of six women&#x27;s sports, with the following additional restrictions:
** Women&#x27;s basketball is a mandatory sport, with at least seven members sponsoring that sport.
** At least two other women&#x27;s team sports must be sponsored.
** At least six members must sponsor five women&#x27;s sports other than basketball, with at least two of those five being team sports. If a conference officially sponsors an NCAA &quot;emerging sport&quot; for women (as of 2023–24, acrobatics &amp; tumbling, equestrianism, rugby union, stunt, triathlon, or wrestling), that sport will be counted if five members (instead of six) sponsor it.

===FBS conferences===
FBS conferences must meet a more stringent set of requirements for NCAA recognition than other conferences:
* A total of at least eight active FBS members.
* To be counted toward this total, a school must participate in conference play in at least six men&#x27;s and eight women&#x27;s sports, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, football, and at least two other women&#x27;s team sports.
** Each school may count one men&#x27;s and one women&#x27;s sport not sponsored by its primary conference toward the above limits, as long as that sport competes in another Division I conference. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports so counted need not be the same sport.

==Sports==

===Men&#x27;s team sports===

Notes:
: The NCAA officially classifies the men&#x27;s championships in volleyball and water polo as &quot;National Collegiate&quot; championships, that being the designation for championships that are open to members of more than one NCAA division. The ice hockey championship, however, is styled as a &quot;Division I&quot; championship because of the previous existence of a separate Division II championship in that sport. 
* Football — D-I football programs are divided into FBS and FCS. The 133 FBS programs can award financial aid to as many as 85 players, with each player able to receive up to a full scholarship. The 128 FCS programs can award up to the equivalent of 63 full scholarships, divided among no more than 85 individuals. Some FCS conferences restrict scholarships to a lower level or prohibit scholarships altogether. 
* Soccer — As of the most recent 2023 NCAA soccer season (part of the 2023–24 academic year), four of the 10 FBS conferences do not sponsor men&#x27;s soccer: the Big 12, Conference USA, Mid-American Conference, and the SEC. Several other D-I conferences also do not sponsor the sport: the Big Sky, MEAC, Mountain West, Southland, and SWAC. The Ohio Valley Conference is the most recent conference to add men&#x27;s soccer; it started sponsoring the sport for the first time in the 2023 season. Conference USA shut down its league after losing most of its men&#x27;s soccer membership to the Sun Belt Conference, followed by the American Athletic Conference taking in CUSA&#x27;s remaining four teams (three of which fully joined The American in 2023) as associate members for 2022. The MAC was reduced to 5 men&#x27;s soccer members in the 2022 season, and shut down its league at the end of that season after being unable to find the sixth member needed to maintain its automatic NCAA tournament bid. Of its final men&#x27;s soccer members, three moved that sport to the Missouri Valley Conference, one to the Big East Conference, and one to the Ohio Valley Conference.
** The Pac-12 will be reduced to two full members in 2024, with only Oregon State sponsoring men&#x27;s soccer. Oregon State will house most of its non-football sports in the West Coast Conference in the 2024–25 and 2025–26 school years. Pac-12 men&#x27;s soccer affiliate San Diego State will move that sport to the Western Athletic Conference.
* Ice hockey — Almost all D-I ice hockey programs are in the Northeast, the Upper Midwest, or the Colorado Front Range. Only one D-I all-sports conference, the Big Ten, sponsors a men&#x27;s hockey league. All other conferences operate as hockey-specific leagues. Of the 61 teams competing in D-I hockey in 2022–23, 22 are otherwise classified as either D-II or D-III; a number of schools from D-II play in D-I ice hockey as the NCAA no longer sponsors a championship in D-II and many have traditional/cultural fan bases that support ice hockey, and the D-III schools were &quot;grandfathered&quot; in to D-I through their having sponsored hockey prior to the creation of D-III.
* Lacrosse — The vast majority of D-I lacrosse programs are from the Northeast, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic. Only five D-I programs are not in the Eastern Time Zone: Air Force and Denver on the Colorado Front Range, Lindenwood on the Missouri side of the St. Louis metropolitan area, Marquette in Milwaukee, and Utah. Lindenwood will drop men&#x27;s lacrosse after the 2024 season (2023–24 school year).
* Volleyball — Of the traditional D-I conferences, only the Big West Conference and Northeast Conference sponsor men&#x27;s volleyball, with those conferences respectively adding the sport in 2017–18 and 2022–23. Two of the other three major volleyball conferences, defined in that sport as leagues that include full Division I members, are volleyball-specific conferences; the third is the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, a multi-sport conference that does not sponsor football or basketball. In addition to the D-I schools, 33 D-II schools are competing in the National Collegiate division in 2023–24; eight of these are members of Conference Carolinas, the first all-sports league outside Division III to sponsor the sport; six are members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference; and four are either full or affiliate members of the East Coast Conference, which began sponsoring the sport in 2023–24.
* Water Polo — The number of D-I schools sponsoring men&#x27;s water polo has declined from 35 in 1987/88 to 22 in 2010/11. No school outside of California has ever made the finals of the championship, and all champions since 1998 have come from one of the four California schools that are leaving the Pac-12 in 2024.

===Men&#x27;s individual sports===
The following table lists the men&#x27;s individual D-I sports with at least 1,000 participating athletes. Sports are ranked by number of athletes.

D-I college wrestling has lost almost half of its programs since 1982.

===Women&#x27;s team sports===

;Notes:
* As in the men&#x27;s table above, sports are ranked in order of total possible scholarships. Numbers for head-count sports are indicated without a decimal point; those for equivalency sports are indicated with a decimal point, with a trailing zero if needed.
* Women&#x27;s soccer is the fastest growing NCAA D-I women&#x27;s team sport over a prolonged period, increasing from 22 teams in 1981–82 to 335 teams in 2021–22. However, in recent years, the fastest-growing has been beach volleyball, which went from 14 Division I teams in 2011–12 to 62 in 2021–22.
* † = Since the 2016–17 school year, rugby is classified by the NCAA as an &quot;emerging sport&quot; for women. Beach volleyball, which had previously been an &quot;emerging sport&quot; under the name of &quot;sand volleyball&quot;, became an official NCAA championship sport in 2015–16.
* * = The number of scholarships are partially linked for (indoor) volleyball and beach volleyball. Schools that field both indoor and beach volleyball teams are allowed 6.0 full scholarship equivalents specifically for beach volleyball as of 2016–17, with the further limitations that (1) no player receiving aid for beach volleyball can be on the indoor volleyball roster and (2) a maximum of 14 individuals can receive aid in beach volleyball. If a school fields only a beach volleyball team, it is allowed 8.0 full scholarship equivalents for that sport, also distributed among no more than 14 individuals.

===Women&#x27;s individual sports===
The following table lists the women&#x27;s individual D-I sports with at least 1,000 participating athletes. Sports are ranked by number of athletes.

== Broadcasting and revenue ==
NCAA Division I schools have broadcasting contracts that showcase their more popular sports — typically football and men&#x27;s basketball — on network television and in basic cable channels. These contracts can be quite lucrative, particularly for D-I schools from the biggest conferences. For example, the Big Ten conference in 2016 entered into contracts with Fox and ESPN that pay the conference $2.64 billion over six years.

The NCAA also holds certain TV contracts. For example, the NCAA&#x27;s contract to show the men&#x27;s basketball championship tournament (widely known as March Madness) is currently under a 14-year deal with CBS and Turner that runs from 2010 to 2024 and pays $11 billion.

For the 2014–15 fiscal year, the conferences that earned the most revenues (and that distributed the most revenues to each of their member schools) were: 
# SEC — $527 million (dispersed $33 million to each of its member schools)
# Big 10 — $449 million (dispersed $32 million each)
# Pac-12 — $439 million (dispersed $25 million each)
# ACC — $403 million (dispersed $26 million each)
# Big 12 — $268 million (dispersed $23 million each)

==Scholarship limits by sport==
The NCAA has limits on the total financial aid each Division I member may award in each sport that the school sponsors. It divides sports that are sponsored into two types for purposes of scholarship limitations:
* &quot;Head-count&quot; sports, in which the NCAA limits the total number of individuals that can receive athletic scholarships, but allows each player to receive up to a full scholarship.
* &quot;Equivalency&quot; sports, in which the NCAA limits the total financial aid that a school can offer in a given sport to the equivalent of a set number of full scholarships. Roster limitations may or may not apply, depending on the sport.
The term &quot;counter&quot; is also key to this concept. The NCAA defines a &quot;counter&quot; as &quot;an individual who is receiving institutional financial aid that is countable against the aid limitations in a sport.&quot;

The number of scholarships that Division I members may award in each sport is listed below. In this table, scholarship numbers for head-count sports are indicated &quot;without a decimal point&quot;; for equivalency sports, they are listed with a decimal point, with a trailing zero if required.

===Rules for multi-sport athletes===
The NCAA also has rules specifying the sport in which multi-sport athletes are to be counted, with the basic rules being:
* Anyone who participates in football is counted in that sport, even if he does not receive financial aid from the football program. An exception exists for players at non-scholarship FCS programs who receive aid in another sport.
* Participants in basketball are counted in that sport, unless they also play football.
* Participants in men&#x27;s ice hockey are counted in that sport, unless they also play football or basketball.
* Participants in both men&#x27;s swimming and diving and men&#x27;s water polo are counted in swimming and diving, unless they count in football or basketball.
* Participants in women&#x27;s (indoor) volleyball are counted in that sport unless they also play basketball.
* All other multi-sport athletes are counted in whichever sport the school chooses.

==Football subdivisions==
Subdivisions in Division I exist only in football. In all other sports, all Division I conferences are equivalent. The subdivisions were recently given names to reflect the differing levels of football play in them.

As of the 2023 season, the main distinctions between Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision schools are scholarship policies and the existence of an official NCAA championship in the latter subdivision. Before the 2023 season, the NCAA required that FBS schools average at least 15,000 attendance, allowing schools to report either total tickets sold or the number of persons in attendance at the games. The requirement was a minimum average of 15,000 people in attendance every other year. These numbers are posted to the NCAA statistics website for football each year. With new rules starting in the 2006 season, it was possible for the number of Bowl Subdivision schools to drop in the future if those schools were not able to pull in enough fans into the games. Additionally, 14 FCS schools had enough attendance to be moved up in 2012. Under current NCAA rules, these schools must have an invitation from an FBS conference in order to move to FBS. The difference in the postseasons in each of the subdivisions grant the FCS an advantage to have the best record in college football history, 17–0, while the FBS only allows a 15–0 record.

FBS attendance requirements were abolished early in the 2023 season, effective immediately. In their place, Division I added new requirements for athletic funding. Effective in 2027–28, FBS schools must fund the equivalent of at least 210 full scholarships across all of their NCAA sports; spend at least $6 million annually on athletic scholarships; and provide at least 90% of the total number of allowed scholarship equivalents across 16 sports, including football.

===Football Bowl Subdivision===

Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, is the top level of college football. Schools in Division I FBS compete in post-season bowl games, with the champions of five conferences, along with the highest-ranked champion of the other five conferences, receiving automatic bids to the access bowls.

FBS schools are limited to a total of 85 football players receiving financial assistance. For competitive reasons, a student receiving partial scholarship counts fully against the total of 85. Nearly all FBS schools that are not on NCAA probation give 85 full scholarships.

As of the current 2024 college football season, there are 133 full members of Division I FBS, plus one transitional school that is considered an FBS member for scheduling purposes. The newest full FBS members are Jacksonville State, James Madison, and Sam Houston, which completed the transition from FCS prior to the 2024 season. The next school to become a full FBS member is Kennesaw State, which joined Conference USA (CUSA) in 2024 and will become a full FBS member a year later. Delaware and Missouri State are set to join CUSA in 2025 and become full FBS members in 2026.

Since the 2016 season, all FBS conferences have been allowed to conduct a championship game that does not count against the limit of 12 regular-season contests. Under the current rules, most recently changed in advance of the 2022 season, conferences have complete freedom to determine the participants in their championship games. From 2016 to 2021, FBS rules allowed such a game to be held either (1) between the winners of each of two divisions, with each team having played a full round-robin schedule within its division, or (2) between the conference&#x27;s top two teams after a full round-robin conference schedule. Before 2016, &quot;exempt&quot; championship games could only be held between the divisional winners of conferences that had at least 12 football teams and split into divisions. The prize is normally a specific bowl game bid for which the conference has a tie-in.

Some conferences have numbers in their names but this often has no relation to the number of member institutions in the conference. The Big Ten Conference did not formally adopt the &quot;Big Ten&quot; name until 1987, but unofficially used that name when it had 10 members from 1917 to 1946, and again from 1949 forward. However, it has continued to use the name even after it expanded to 11 members with the addition of Penn State in 1990, 12 with the addition of Nebraska in 2011, and 14 with the arrival of Maryland and Rutgers in 2014. The Big 12 Conference was established in 1996 with 12 members, but continues to use that name even after a number of departures and a few replacements left the conference with 10 members, and later expansions brought the membership totals to 14 in 2023 and 16 effective in 2024. On the other hand, the Pac-12 Conference used names (official or unofficial) that have reflected the number of members from the establishment of its current charter in 1959 until its collapse in 2024. The conference unofficially used &quot;Big Five&quot; (1959–62), &quot;Big Six&quot; (1962–64), and &quot;Pacific-8&quot; (1964–68) before officially adopting the &quot;Pacific-8&quot; name. The name duly changed to &quot;Pacific-10&quot; in 1978 with the addition of Arizona and Arizona State, and &quot;Pac-12&quot; (instead of &quot;Pacific-12&quot;) in 2011 when Colorado and Utah joined. Conferences also tend to ignore their regional names when adding new schools. For example, the Pac-8/10/12 retained its &quot;Pacific&quot; moniker even though its four most recent additions (Arizona, Arizona State, Colorado, Utah) are located in the inland West, and the original Big East kept its name even after adding schools (either in all sports or for football only) located in areas traditionally considered to be in the Midwest (Cincinnati, DePaul, Marquette, Notre Dame), Upper South (Louisville, Memphis) and Southwest (Houston, SMU). The non-football conference that assumed the Big East name when the original Big East split in 2013 is another example of this phenomenon, as half of its 10 inaugural schools (Butler, Creighton, DePaul, Marquette, Xavier) are traditionally regarded as being Midwestern. An even more extrema example of this phenomenon is the Atlantic Coast Conference. For the first 60 years after its 1953 founding, the ACC consisted entirely of schools in Atlantic Coast states. However, in 2013, the conference added three new schools, two of which (Pittsburgh and, for non-football sports, Indiana-based Notre Dame) were in states without an Atlantic shoreline. The following year saw the ACC add another non-Atlantic school in Louisville. Then, in 2023, the conference announced it would expand in 2024 to the &quot;Pacific&quot; coast with San Francisco Bay Area rivals California and Stanford, and also add SMU from Dallas–Fort Worth.

;Notes:
===Football Championship Subdivision===

The Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), formerly known as Division I-AA, consists of 130 teams as of the 2022 season, with all participating in one of 14 conferences. The &quot;I-AA&quot; designation was dropped by the NCAA in 2006, although it is still informally and commonly used. FCS teams are limited to 63 players on scholarship (compared to 85 for FBS teams) and usually play an 11-game schedule (compared to 12 games for FBS teams). The FCS determines its national champion through an NCAA-sanctioned single-elimination bracket tournament, culminating in a title game, the NCAA Division I Football Championship. As of the 2018 season, the tournament begins with 24 teams; 10 conference champions that received automatic bids, and 14 teams selected at-large by a selection committee.

The postseason tournament traditionally begins on Thanksgiving weekend in late November. When I-AA was formed in 1978, the playoffs included just four teams for its first three seasons, doubling to eight teams for one season in 1981. From 1982 to 1985, there was a 12-team tournament; this expanded to 16 teams in 1986. The playoffs expanded to 20 teams starting in 2010, then grew to 24 teams in 2013. Since the 2010 season, the title game is held in early January at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas. From 1997 through 2009, the title game was played in December in Chattanooga, Tennessee, preceded by five seasons in Huntington, West Virginia.

==== Abstainers ====
The Football Championship Subdivision includes several conferences which do not participate in the eponymous post-season championship tournament.

The Ivy League was reclassified to I-AA (FCS) following the 1981 season, and plays a strict ten-game schedule. Although it qualifies for an automatic bid, the Ivy League has not played any postseason games at all since becoming a conference, citing academic concerns. The Ivy League member to play in a bowl game was Columbia in the 1934 Rose Bowl.

The Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) has its own championship game in mid-December between the champions of its East and West divisions. Also, three of its member schools traditionally do not finish their regular seasons until Thanksgiving weekend. Grambling State and Southern play each other in the Bayou Classic, and Alabama State plays Tuskegee (of Division II) in the Turkey Day Classic. SWAC teams are eligible to accept at-large bids if their schedule is not in conflict. The last SWAC team to participate in the I-AA playoffs was Jackson State in 1997; the SWAC never achieved success in the tournament, going winless in 19 games in twenty years (1978–97). It had greater success outside the conference while in Division II and the preceding College Division.

From 2006 through 2009, the Pioneer Football League and Northeast Conference champions played in the Gridiron Classic. If a league champion was invited to the national championship playoff as an at-large bid (something the Pioneer league, at least, never received), the second-place team would play in the Gridiron Classic. That game was scrapped after the 2009 season when its four-year contract ran out; this coincided with the NCAA&#x27;s announcement that the Northeast Conference would get an automatic bid to the tournament starting in 2010. The Big South Conference also received an automatic bid in the same season. The Pioneer Football League earned an automatic bid beginning in 2013.

The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) began abstaining from the playoffs with the 2015 season. Like the SWAC, its members are eligible for at-large bids, and the two conferences have faced off in the Celebration Bowl as an alternative postseason game since the 2015 season.

Schools in a transition period after joining the FCS from a lower division (or from the NAIA) are also ineligible for the playoffs.

==== Scholarships ====
Division I FCS schools are currently restricted to giving financial assistance amounting to 63 full scholarships. As FCS football is an &quot;equivalency&quot; sport (as opposed to the &quot;head-count&quot; status of FBS football), Championship Subdivision schools may divide their allotment into partial scholarships. However, FCS schools may only have 85 players receiving any sort of athletic financial aid for football—the same numeric limit as FBS schools. Because of competitive forces, however, a substantial number of players in Championship Subdivision programs are on full scholarships. A former difference was that FCS schools had a limit of 30 players that could be provided with financial aid in a given season, while FBS schools were limited to 25 such additions per season. These limits were suspended in 2020 before being completely eliminated for both subdivisions in 2023. Finally, FCS schools are limited to 95 individuals participating in preseason practices, as opposed to 105 at FBS schools (the three service academies that play FBS football are exempt from preseason practice player limits by NCAA rule).

A few Championship Subdivision conferences are composed of schools that offer no athletic scholarships at all, most notably the Ivy League and the Pioneer Football League (PFL), a football-only conference. The Ivy League allows no athletic scholarships at all, while the PFL consists of schools that offer scholarships in other sports but choose not to take on the expense of a scholarship football program. The Northeast Conference also sponsored non-scholarship football, but began offering a maximum of 30 full scholarship equivalents in 2006, which grew to 40 in 2011 after a later vote of the league&#x27;s school presidents and athletic directors and has since increased to 45. The Patriot League only began awarding football scholarships in the 2013 season, with the first scholarships awarded only to incoming freshmen. Before the conference began its transition to scholarship football, athletes receiving scholarships in other sports were ineligible to play football for member schools. Since the completion of the transition with the 2016 season, member schools have been allowed up to 60 full scholarship equivalents.

;Notes:
===Division I non-football schools===
Several Bowl Subdivision and Championship Subdivision conferences have member institutions that do not compete in football. Such schools are sometimes unofficially referred to as I-AAA.

The following non-football conferences have full members that sponsor football:
* The America East Conference has four football-sponsoring schools: Albany, Bryant, Maine, and New Hampshire. All play in CAA Football, the technically separate football league of the Coastal Athletic Association (CAA).
* The Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN) has seven schools that sponsor football.
** Austin Peay, Central Arkansas, Eastern Kentucky, North Alabama, and West Georgia play in the United Athletic Conference (UAC), which started play in 2023 as a football-only merger between the ASUN and the Western Athletic Conference.
** Stetson plays in the PFL.
** Bellarmine does not play NCAA football, instead playing the weight-restricted and non-NCAA variant of sprint football.
* The Atlantic 10 Conference has seven football-sponsoring members:
** Davidson and Dayton play in the PFL.
** Duquesne plays in the Northeast Conference (NEC).
** Fordham plays in the Patriot League.
** Rhode Island and Richmond play in CAA Football. Richmond will leave CAA Football in 2025 for football membership in the Patriot League.
** UMass plays FBS football as an independent through the 2024 season, after which it will leave the A-10 for the Mid-American Conference.
* The current Big East Conference has four football-sponsoring schools. Three play in FCS: Butler in the PFL, Georgetown in the Patriot League, and Villanova in CAA Football. The fourth, UConn, plays as an FBS independent.
* Three Big West Conference members have football programs. UC Davis and Cal Poly play FCS football in the Big Sky Conference, and Hawaiʻi plays FBS football in the Mountain West Conference. Hawaiʻi will leave the Big West in 2026 to become a full Mountain West member.
* The Horizon League has two football schools. Robert Morris plays in the NEC, and Youngstown State plays in the Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC).
* The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) has three football schools. Marist plays in the PFL, and Merrimack and Sacred Heart are FCS independents.
* The Missouri Valley Conference has eight football schools: Drake, Illinois State, Indiana State, Missouri State, Murray State, Northern Iowa, Southern Illinois and Valparaiso. Drake and Valparaiso play in the PFL; all others compete in the MVFC (a separate legal entity from the MVC, despite the similar name). Missouri State started a transition to FBS in 2024 and joins CUSA in 2025. 
* The Summit League has five football schools, four of which play in the MVFC: North Dakota, North Dakota State, South Dakota, and South Dakota State. The fifth, St. Thomas of Minnesota, plays in the PFL.
* The West Coast Conference&#x27;s (WCC) only football school, San Diego, plays in the PFL. Oregon State and Washington State, the only members of the Pac-12 Conference beyond the 2023–24 school year, are housing most of their non-football sports in the WCC in 2024–25 and 2025–26.
* The Western Athletic Conference has four football schools, all playing in the UAC: Abilene Christian, Southern Utah, Tarleton, and Utah Tech.

The following Division I conferences do not sponsor football. These conferences still compete in Division I for all sports that they sponsor.

;Notes:
Of these, the two that most recently sponsored football were the Atlantic 10 and MAAC. The A-10 football league dissolved in 2006 with its members going to CAA Football, the technically separate football league operated by the all-sports Coastal Athletic Association. In addition, four A-10 schools (Dayton, Fordham, Duquesne, and Massachusetts) play football in a conference other CAA Football, which still includes two full-time A-10 members (Rhode Island and Richmond, the latter of which will move football to the Patriot League in 2025 ). The MAAC stopped sponsoring football in 2007, after most of its members gradually stopped fielding teams. Among current MAAC members that were in the conference before 2007, only Marist, which plays in the Pioneer Football League, still sponsors football.

From 2013 to 2021, the Western Athletic Conference was a non-football league, having dropped football after a near-complete membership turnover that saw the conference stripped of all but two of its football-sponsoring members. The two remaining football-sponsoring schools, Idaho and New Mexico State, played the 2013 season as FBS independents before becoming football-only members of the Sun Belt Conference in 2014. Both left Sun Belt football in 2018, with Idaho downgrading to FCS status and adding football to its all-sports Big Sky Conference membership and New Mexico State becoming an FBS independent. The WAC added two more football-sponsoring schools with the 2020 arrival of Tarleton and Utah Tech (then Dixie State) from Division II; both schools planned to be FCS independents for the foreseeable future. The WAC would reinstate football at the FCS level in 2021, coinciding with the arrival of four new members with FCS football; for its first season, it entered into a formal partnership with the ASUN Conference to give it enough playoff-eligible members to receive an automatic playoff berth. This partnership was renewed for the 2022 season, with five ASUN and three WAC schools participating, though each conference will play its own schedule. After the 2022 season, the ASUN and WAC announced a full football merger for 2023 and beyond under the banner of the United Athletic Conference.

==Division I in ice hockey==


Some sports, most notably ice hockey and men&#x27;s volleyball, have completely different conference structures that operate outside of the normal NCAA sports conference structure.

As ice hockey is limited to a much smaller number of almost exclusively Northern schools, there is a completely different conference structure for teams. These conferences feature a mix of teams that play their other sports in various Division I conferences, and even Division II and Division III schools. For most of the early 21st century, there was no correlation between a team&#x27;s ice hockey affiliation and its affiliation for other sports, with the exception of the Ivy League&#x27;s hockey-playing schools all being members of the ECAC. For example, before 2013, the Hockey East men&#x27;s conference consisted of one ACC school, one Big East school, four schools from the America East, one from the A-10, one CAA school, and two schools from the D-II Northeast-10 Conference, while the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) both had some Big Ten representation, plus Division II and III schools. Also, the divisional structure is truncated, with the Division II championship abolished in 1999.

The Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ceased its sponsorship of the sport in 2003, with the remaining members forming Atlantic Hockey. For the next decade, no regular all-sport conferences sponsored ice hockey.

Starting with the 2013–14 season, Division I men&#x27;s hockey experienced a major realignment. The Big Ten Conference began to sponsor ice hockey, and their institutions withdrew their membership from the WCHA and CCHA. Additionally, six other schools from those conferences withdrew to form the new National Collegiate Hockey Conference at the same time. The fallout from these moves led to the demise of the original CCHA, two more teams entering the NCHC, and further membership turnover in the men&#x27;s side of the WCHA.

Women&#x27;s hockey was largely unaffected by this realignment. The Big Ten still has only four members with varsity women&#x27;s hockey (full members Michigan and Michigan State only ice men&#x27;s teams, as does hockey-only member Notre Dame), with six teams required under conference bylaws for official sponsorship. As a result, the only changes in women&#x27;s hockey affiliations in the 2010–14 period occurred in College Hockey America, which saw two schools drop the sport and three new members join.

The next significant realignment took place after the 2020–21 season, when seven of the 10 then-current men&#x27;s members of the WCHA left to form a revived CCHA, which in turn led to the demise of the men&#x27;s side of the WCHA.

;Notes
==Classification debate==
In the early 21st century, a controversy arose in the NCAA over whether schools will continue to be allowed to have one showcased program in Division I with the remainder of the athletic program in a lower division, as is the case of, notably, Johns Hopkins University lacrosse as well as Colorado College and University of Alabama in Huntsville in ice hockey. This is an especially important issue in hockey, which has no Division II national championship and has several schools whose other athletic programs compete in Division II and Division III.

This controversy was resolved at the 2004 NCAA Convention in Nashville, Tennessee when the members supported Proposal 65–1, the amended legislation co-sponsored by Colorado College, Clarkson University, Hartwick College, the Johns Hopkins University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rutgers University–Newark, St. Lawrence University, and SUNY Oneonta. Each school affected by this debate is allowed to grant financial aid to student-athletes who compete in Division I programs in one men&#x27;s sport and one women&#x27;s sport. It is still permitted for other schools to place one men&#x27;s and one women&#x27;s sport in Division I going forward, but they cannot offer scholarships without bringing the whole program into compliance with Division I rules. In addition, schools in Divisions II and III are allowed to &quot;play up&quot; in any sport that does not have a championship for the school&#x27;s own division, but only Division II programs and any Division III programs covered by the exemption can offer scholarships in those sports.

Five Division I programs at &quot;waiver schools&quot; were grandfathered with the passing of Proposal 65-1:

* Clarkson University – men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey
* Colorado College – men&#x27;s ice hockey, women&#x27;s soccer
* Johns Hopkins University – men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute – men&#x27;s ice hockey (women&#x27;s ice hockey moved up to Division I in 2005)
* St. Lawrence University – men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey
An additional three programs were grandfathered in Proposal 65-1 but no longer are sponsored in Division I:

* Hartwick College – men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s water polo (men&#x27;s soccer dropped to Division III in 2018, with women&#x27;s water polo discontinued at the same time)
* Rutgers University–Newark – men&#x27;s volleyball (dropped to Division III in 2014)
* SUNY Oneonta – men&#x27;s soccer (dropped to Division III in 2006)

<text>STOBAR (&quot;short take-off but arrested recovery&quot; or &quot;short take-off, barrier-arrested recovery&quot;) is a system used for the launch and recovery of aircraft from the deck of an aircraft carrier, combining elements of &quot;short take-off and vertical landing&quot; (STOVL) with &quot;catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery&quot; (CATOBAR).

Aircraft launch under their own power using a ski-jump to assist take-off (rather than using a catapult). However, the planes are conventional, rather than STOVL aircraft, and thus require arrestor wires to land on the ship. The STOBAR system is simpler to build than CATOBAR. , it has been used widely on Russian, Indian, and Chinese carriers.

== Advantages ==
Compared to CATOBAR, STOBAR is less expensive to develop. It is easier to operate than a CATOBAR configuration, which requires large number of operators to launch the aircraft. The lack of any moving parts in a ski-jump makes it less expensive to maintain than a catapult. It does not require any additional system to generate force required to launch the aircraft, unlike CATOBAR where an external force is needed to be generated either from steam catapult or Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) to launch the aircraft.

== Limitations ==
One major limitation of STOBAR configuration is that it only works with fighter aircraft that have a high thrust-to-weight ratio such as Su-33 or MiG-29K and thus limits the kind of aircraft that can be operated from the carrier. It is not known what restrictions ski-jump takeoff implies on maximal aircraft weight. According to some sources, in order to become airborne, the aircraft may be required to limit its weaponry and fuel package in order to reduce the launch weight of the aircraft. However, according to other sources, the Super Hornet can take-off from a ski-jump with a significant weapons load. Using ski-jump can limit the ability to conduct sorties faster on STOBAR aircraft carrier. STOBAR carriers must maintain a speed of in order to generate wind speed required on deck which is essential for conducting aircraft launch operations.

== List of STOBAR aircraft ==

* HAL Tejas – two naval variants are being developed for the Indian Navy; a prototype (NP-1) is currently undergoing flight testing.
* Mikoyan MiG-29K – currently active with the Indian Navy and the Russian Navy.
* Shenyang J-15 – partially based on the Su-33, operated by the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy on .
* Sukhoi Su-33 – developed from Su-27 and only operated by the Russian Navy.

==Users==
As of 2025, three countries currently operate STOBAR-type carriers; Russia, India and China have built a STOBAR ship for operation, while both India and China have procured STOBAR ships that were built by Russia and have had them converted for their own use.

<doc id="669942" wikidata="Q5532516" url="?curid=669942" title="Generalized star-height problem">
<text>The generalized star-height problem in formal language theory is the open question whether all regular languages can be expressed using generalized regular expressions with a limited nesting depth of Kleene stars. Here, generalized regular expressions are defined like regular expressions, but they have a built-in complement operator. For a regular language, its generalized star height is defined as the minimum nesting depth of Kleene stars needed in order to describe the language by means of a generalized regular expression, hence the name of the problem. 

More specifically, it is an open question whether a nesting depth of more than 1 is required, and if so, whether there is an algorithm to determine the minimum required star height.

Regular languages of star-height 0 are also known as star-free languages. The theorem of Schützenberger provides an algebraic characterization of star-free languages by means of aperiodic syntactic monoids. In particular star-free languages are a proper decidable subclass of regular languages.

<doc id="669948" wikidata="Q3773629" url="?curid=669948" title="Robert L. Park">
<text>Robert Lee Park (January 16, 1931 – April 29, 2020) was an American professor of physics at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a former director of public information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society. Park was most noted for his critical commentaries on alternative medicine and pseudoscience, as well as his criticism of how legitimate science is distorted or ignored by the media, some scientists, and public policy advocates as expressed in his book &quot;Voodoo Science&quot;. He was also noted for his preference for robotic over crewed space exploration.

==Early life==
Park was born in 1931 in Kansas City, Missouri. His father was a lawyer and a farmer in southern Texas, and Park had originally intended to attend law school himself. He entered the Air Force in 1951 and served (among other places) at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico until 1956. When the Air Force sent him to radar school, he discovered a passion for physics.

==Academic career==
Park obtained his bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in physics at the University of Texas at Austin in 1958 and 1960, and his Ph.D. in physics at Brown University in 1964. During his graduate work he was associated with physicist Harrison E. Farnsworth with whom he co-authored several papers.

Park spent almost a decade working as a member of the technical staff, and later director of the Surface Physics Division, at Sandia National Laboratories, a U.S. government weapons research laboratory. In 1974, Park took a faculty position at the University of Maryland physics department, where he remained until retirement. He was director of UMD&#x27;s Center of Materials Research from 1975 to 1978 and chairman of the Department of Physics and Astronomy from 1978 to 1982.

He was a Fellow of the American Physical Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Vacuum Society.

==Public policy work==
From 1983 until 2006, he was director of public information at the Washington office of the American Physical Society. In this role (which he established), he engaged politicians and the press on matters of science and public policy. The Washington office now employs six people and Park continued in an advisory capacity. He has been seen in the media as an outspoken critic of human spaceflight, efforts to colonize space, and the prototype U.S. National Missile Defense (as well as its predecessor SDI).

Since 2013, Park has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

==Popular writing==
Park wrote a column, &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot;, which appeared on the University of Maryland&#x27;s website. It featured discussions on topics such as science news, space exploration, energy, the government in science, pseudoscience, alternative medicine, the creation–evolution controversy, and nuclear weapons. Park has also expressed his opinion that Wikipedia is a target for misuse by the &quot;purveyors of pseudoscience&quot;, though he has also stated that he finds the site to be both indispensable and &quot;cool&quot;. In 2009 Park gave a public lecture at Dartmouth College on Malthusian overpopulation and the environment. He called for the distribution of the birth control pill, &quot;arguably the most important technological development in history&quot;, to reduce fertility rates in developing nations. Park has criticized Texas A&amp;M University&#x27;s Trotter Prize for being awarded to creationist and intelligent design advocate William A. Dembski, whom Park calls &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s top pseudoscientists&quot;, for inappropriately forcing religion and science together.

===Books===
In 2000 Park published the book &quot;Voodoo Science&quot;, which addressed and criticized topics such as alternative medicine, telepathy and homeopathy. Reviewing the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ed Regis compared it positively to the 1957 book by Martin Gardner, &quot;Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science&quot;, calling &quot;Voodoo Science&quot; a &quot;worthy successor&quot; and praising it for explaining why various purportedly scientific claims were in fact impossible.
Science fiction author Charles Platt reviewed the book for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, criticizing it for citing news stories as the inspiration for his criticisms and using &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks against individuals criticized rather than performing a more thorough investigation of the topics, and speaking with the actual researchers. This was followed by a number of letters to the editor criticizing Platt for bias.

In 2010 Park published his second book, &quot;Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; called the book &quot;disjointed&quot;, unfavorably comparing it to Daniel Dennett&#x27;s &quot;Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon&quot; for merely summarizing the existing arguments about science and religion. Park commented that the reviewer for &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was offended at his assertion that &quot;science is the only way of knowing.&quot; &quot;Booklist&quot; reviewed the book positively for its lucid style, engaging with respected scientists who also hold strong religious faith and its internal logic against claims of supernatural revelation and New Age irrationality. The same review noted that Park was less compelling in addressing his own atheism, neurochemistry and its ability to address problems such as free will.

==Personal life==
Park was married to Gerry and lived in Adelphi, Maryland. They have two sons, Robert Jr. and Daniel, and three grandchildren.

On September 3, 2000, Park was hospitalized after being struck by a falling oak tree. He later wrote about the experience in his book, &quot;Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science&quot;.

Park suffered a hemorrhagic stroke on March 17, 2013, which resulted in difficulty with reading, writing, and speech. In a newsletter update to his readers dated July 12, 2013, Park wrote, &quot;Many wonderful people are helping me, but recovery is a long process. I am optimistic that I will resume writing What’s New.&quot; Park stated that he will continue writing his newsletter because &quot;the public is often misled by reports in the media and unaware of it&quot;.

Park died April 29, 2020, survived by his wife and two sons.

<text>Erik Ivar Fredholm (7 April 1866 – 17 August 1927) was a Swedish mathematician whose work on integral equations and operator theory foreshadowed the theory of Hilbert spaces.

==Biography==

Fredholm was born in Stockholm in 1866. He obtained his PhD at Uppsala University in 1898, under the supervision of Gösta Mittag-Leffler. He was &quot;docent&quot; at Stockholm University from 1898 to 1906 and professor from 1906 until his death. In 1914 he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and in 1922 a foreign member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters. Beside his academic career he was recruited to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency when it was founded in 1902. He later served as an actuary at the insurance company Skandia (1904-1927), where his Fredholm equation was used to calculate buyback-prices.

From 1911, he was married to Agnes Maria Liljeblad, the secretary of Mittag-Leffler.

==Mathematical work==

In , Fredholm introduced and analysed a class of integral equations now called Fredholm equations. His analysis included the construction of Fredholm determinants, and the proof of the Fredholm theorems.

==Honours==

Fredholm was a member of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters and of the Accademia dei Lincei; he was awarded the Poncelet Prize for 1908.

The lunar crater &quot;Fredholm&quot; is named after him as is the asteroid 21659 Fredholm.

<doc id="669964" wikidata="Q696802" url="?curid=669964" title="Paris Peace Accords">
<text>The Paris Peace Accords (), officially the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet Nam (), was a peace agreement signed on January 27, 1973, to establish peace in Vietnam and end the Vietnam War. It took effect at 8:00 the following day. The agreement was signed by the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam); the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam); the United States; and the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRG), which represented South Vietnamese communists. US ground forces had begun to withdraw from Vietnam in 1969, and had suffered from deteriorating morale during the withdrawal. By the beginning of 1972 those that remained had very little involvement in combat. The last American infantry battalions withdrew in August 1972. Most air and naval forces, and most advisers, also were gone from South Vietnam by that time, though air and naval forces not based in South Vietnam were still playing a large role in the war. The Paris Agreement removed the remaining US forces. Direct US military intervention was ended, and fighting between the three remaining powers temporarily stopped for less than a day. The agreement was not ratified by the US Senate.

The negotiations that led to the accord began in 1968, after various lengthy delays. As a result of the accord, the International Control Commission (ICC) was replaced by the International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS), which consisted of Canada, Poland, Hungary, and Indonesia, to monitor the agreement. The main negotiators of the agreement were US National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese Politburo member Lê Đức Thọ. Both men were awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts, but Lê Đức Thọ refused to accept it.

The agreement&#x27;s provisions were immediately and frequently broken by both North and South Vietnamese forces with no official response from the United States. Open fighting broke out in March 1973, and North Vietnamese offensives enlarged their territory by the end of the year. Two years later, a massive North Vietnamese offensive conquered South Vietnam on April 30, 1975, and the two countries, which had been separated since 1954, united once more on July 2, 1976, as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

Part of the negotiations took place in the former residence of the French painter Fernand Léger; it was bequeathed to the French Communist Party. The street of the house was named after Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, who had commanded French forces in Vietnam after the Second World War.

==Provisions==
The agreement called for:
*The withdrawal of all US and allied forces within sixty days.
*The return of prisoners of war parallel to the above.
*The clearing of mines from North Vietnamese ports by the US.
*The reunification of Vietnam through peaceful means without coercion or annexation by either party, and without foreign interference.
*The establishment of &quot;Joint Military Commissions&quot; composed of the four parties and an &quot;International Commission of Control and Supervision&quot; composed of Canada, Hungary, Indonesia, and Poland to implement the cease-fire. Both operate by unanimity.
*The withdrawal of foreign troops from Laos and Cambodia. 
*A ban on the introduction of war material in South Vietnam unless on a replacement basis.
*A ban on introducing further military personnel into South Vietnam.

==Paris peace negotiations==
===Early deadlocks===

Following the strong showing of anti-war candidate Eugene McCarthy in the New Hampshire primary, in March 1968 US President Lyndon B. Johnson halted bombing operations over the northern portion of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder), in order to encourage Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) to begin negotiations. Although some sources state that the bombing halt decision announced on March 31, 1968, was related to events occurring within the White House and the Presidents counsel of Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford and others rather than the events in New Hampshire. Shortly thereafter, Hanoi agreed to discuss a complete halt of the bombing, and a date was set for representatives of both parties to meet in Paris. The sides first met on May 10, with the delegations headed by Xuân Thuỷ, who would remain the official leader of the North Vietnamese delegation throughout the process, and US ambassador-at-large W. Averell Harriman.

For five months, the negotiations stalled as North Vietnam demanded that all bombing of North Vietnam be stopped, while the US side demanded that North Vietnam agree to a reciprocal de-escalation in South Vietnam; it was not until October 31 that Johnson agreed to end the air strikes and serious negotiations could begin.

One of the largest hurdles to effective negotiation was the fact that North Vietnam and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF, or Viet Cong) in the South, refused to recognize the government of South Vietnam; with equal persistence, the government in Saigon refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the NLF. Harriman resolved this dispute by developing a system by which North Vietnam and U.S would be the named parties; NLF officials could join the North Vietnam team without being recognized by South Vietnam, while Saigon&#x27;s representatives joined their US allies.

A similar debate concerned the shape of the table to be used at the conference. The North favored a circular table, in which all parties, including NLF representatives, would appear to be &quot;equal&quot;&#x27; in importance. The South Vietnamese argued that only a rectangular table was acceptable, for only a rectangle could show two distinct sides to the conflict. Eventually a compromise was reached, in which representatives of the northern and southern governments would sit at a circular table, with members representing all other parties sitting at individual square tables around them.

===Negotiations and the Nixon campaign===
Bryce Harlow, a former White House staff member in the Eisenhower administration, claimed to have &quot;a double agent working in the White House...I kept Nixon informed.&quot; Harlow and Henry Kissinger (who was friendly with both campaigns and guaranteed a job in either a Humphrey or Nixon administration in the upcoming election) separately predicted Johnson&#x27;s &quot;bombing halt.&quot; Democratic senator George Smathers informed President Johnson that &quot;the word is out that we are making an effort to throw the election to Humphrey. Nixon has been told of it.&quot;

According to presidential historian Robert Dallek, Kissinger&#x27;s advice &quot;rested not on special knowledge of decision making at the White House but on an astute analyst&#x27;s insight into what was happening.&quot; CIA intelligence analyst William Bundy stated that Kissinger obtained &quot;no useful inside information&quot; from his trip to Paris, and &quot;almost any experienced Hanoi watcher might have come to the same conclusion.&quot; While Kissinger may have &quot;hinted that his advice was based on contacts with the Paris delegation,&quot; this sort of &quot;self-promotion...is at worst a minor and not uncommon practice, quite different from getting and reporting real secrets.&quot;

Nixon asked prominent Chinese-American politician Anna Chennault to be his &quot;channel to Mr. Thieu&quot;; Chennault agreed and periodically reported to John Mitchell that Thieu had no intention of attending a peace conference. On November 2, Chennault informed the South Vietnamese ambassador: &quot;I have just heard from my boss in Albuquerque who says his boss [Nixon] is going to win. And you tell your boss [Thieu] to hold on a while longer.&quot; Johnson found out through the NSA and was enraged saying that Nixon had &quot;blood on his hands&quot; and that Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen agreed with Johnson that such action was &quot;treason.&quot; Defense Secretary Clark Clifford considered the moves an illegal violation of the Logan Act.

In response, Johnson ordered the wire-tapping of members of the Nixon campaign. Dallek wrote that Nixon&#x27;s efforts &quot;probably made no difference&quot; because Thieu was unwilling to attend the talks and there was little chance of an agreement being reached before the election; however, his use of information provided by Harlow and Kissinger was morally questionable, and vice president Humphrey&#x27;s decision not to make Nixon&#x27;s actions public was &quot;an uncommon act of political decency.&quot;

===Nixon administration===
After winning the 1968 presidential election, Richard Nixon became president of the US in January 1969. He then replaced US ambassador Harriman with Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., who was later replaced by David Bruce. Also that year, the NLF set up a Provisional Revolutionary Government (PRG) to gain government status at the talks. However, the primary negotiations that led to the agreement did not occur at the Peace Conference at all but were carried out during secret negotiations between Kissinger and Lê Đức Thọ, which began on August 4, 1969.

North Vietnam insisted for three years that the agreement could not be concluded unless the United States agreed to remove South Vietnamese President Thiệu from power and replace him with someone more acceptable to Hanoi. Nixon and Kissinger were unwilling to sign an agreement to overthrow a government the NLF had failed to overthrow by force of arms, though the extent of North Vietnamese demands is contested. Historian Marilyn B. Young, contends that the contents of Hanoi&#x27;s proposal were systematically distorted from their original plea to &quot;permit&quot; Thiệu&#x27;s replacement, to what Kissinger propagated as a demand for his overthrow.

===Breakthrough and agreement===
On May 8, 1972, Nixon made a major concession to North Vietnam by announcing that the US would accept a cease-fire in place as a precondition for its military withdrawal. In other words, the US would withdraw its forces from South Vietnam without North Vietnam doing the same. The concession broke a deadlock and resulted in progress in the talks over the next few months.

The final major breakthrough came on October 8, 1972. Prior to this, North Vietnam had been disappointed by the results of its &quot;Nguyen Hue Offensive&quot; (known in the West as the Easter Offensive), which had resulted in the United States countering with &quot;Operation Linebacker&quot;, a significant air bombing campaign that blunted the North&#x27;s drive in the South as well as inflicting damage in the North. Also, they feared increased isolation if Nixon&#x27;s efforts at détente significantly improved US relations with the chief communist powers, the Soviet Union and the People&#x27;s Republic of China, who were backing the North Vietnamese military effort. In a meeting with Kissinger, Thọ significantly modified his bargaining line, allowing that the Saigon government could remain in power and that negotiations between the two South Vietnamese parties could develop a final settlement. Within 10 days the secret talks drew up a final draft. Kissinger held a press conference in Washington during which he announced that &quot;peace is at hand.&quot;

When Thiệu, who had not even been informed of the secret negotiations, was presented with the draft of the new agreement, he was furious with Kissinger and Nixon (who were perfectly aware of South Vietnam&#x27;s negotiating position) and refused to accept it without significant changes. He then made several public radio addresses, claiming that the proposed agreement was worse than it actually was. Hanoi was flabbergasted, believing that it had been duped into a propaganda ploy by Kissinger. On October 26, Radio Hanoi broadcast key details of the draft agreement.

However, as US casualties had mounted throughout the conflict since 1965, American domestic support for the war had deteriorated, and by late 1972 there was major pressure on the Nixon administration to withdraw from the war. Consequently, the US brought great diplomatic pressure upon their South Vietnamese ally to sign the agreement even if the concessions Thiệu wanted could not be achieved. Nixon pledged to provide continued substantial aid to South Vietnam and given his recent landslide victory in the presidential election, it seemed possible that he would be able to follow through on that pledge. To demonstrate his seriousness to Thiệu, Nixon ordered the heavy Operation Linebacker II bombings of North Vietnam in December 1972. Nixon also attempted to bolster South Vietnam&#x27;s military forces by ordering that large quantities of US military material and equipment be given to South Vietnam from May to December 1972 under Operations Enhance and Enhance Plus. These operations were also designed to keep North Vietnam at the negotiating table and to prevent them from abandoning negotiations and seeking total victory. When the North Vietnamese government agreed to resume &quot;technical&quot; discussions with the United States, Nixon ordered a halt to bombings north of the 20th parallel on December 30. With the US committed to disengagement (and after threats from Nixon that South Vietnam would be abandoned if he did not agree), Thiệu had little choice but to accede.

On January 15, 1973, Nixon announced a suspension of offensive actions against North Vietnam. Kissinger and Thọ met again on January 23 and signed off on an agreement that was basically identical to the draft of three months earlier. The agreement was signed by the leaders of the official delegations on January 27, 1973, at the Hotel Majestic in Paris.

==Aftermath==


The Paris Peace Accords effectively removed the US from the conflict in Vietnam. Prisoners from both sides were exchanged, with American ones primarily released during Operation Homecoming. Around 31,961 North Vietnamese/VC prisoners (26,880 military, 5,081 civilians) were released in return for 5,942 South Vietnamese prisoners. However, the agreement&#x27;s provisions were routinely flouted by both the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese government, eliciting no response from the United States, and ultimately resulting in the communists enlarging the area under their control by the end of 1973. North Vietnamese military forces gradually built up their military infrastructure in the areas they controlled and two years later were in a position to launch the successful offensive that ended South Vietnam&#x27;s status as an independent country. Fighting began almost immediately after the agreement was signed, due to a series of mutual retaliations, and by March 1973, full-fledged war had resumed.

Nixon had secretly promised Thiệu that he would use airpower to support the South Vietnamese government should it be necessary. During his confirmation hearings in June 1973, Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger was sharply criticized by some senators after he stated that he would recommend resumption of US bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam, but by August 15, 1973, 95% of American troops and their allies had left Vietnam (both North and South) as well as Cambodia and Laos under the Case-Church Amendment. The amendment, which was approved by the US Congress in June 1973, prohibited further US military activity in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia unless the president secured Congressional approval in advance. However, during this time, Nixon was being driven from office due to the Watergate scandal, which led to his resignation in 1974. When the North Vietnamese began their final offensive early in 1975, the US Congress refused to appropriate increased military assistance for South Vietnam, citing strong opposition to the war by Americans and the loss of American equipment to the North by retreating Southern forces. Thiệu subsequently resigned, accusing the US of betrayal in a TV and radio address:

Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese army on April 30, 1975. Schlesinger had announced early in the morning of April 29 the beginning of Operation Frequent Wind, which entailed the evacuation of the last US diplomatic, military and civilian personnel from Saigon via helicopter, which was completed in the early morning hours of April 30. Not only did North Vietnam conquer South Vietnam, but the communists were also victorious in Cambodia when the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, as were the Pathet Lao in Laos successful in capturing Vientiane on December 2. Like Saigon, US civilian and military personnel were evacuated from Phnom Penh, US diplomatic presence in Vientiane was significantly downgraded, and the number of remaining US personnel was severely reduced.

==Assessment==
According to Finnish historian Jussi Hanhimäki, due to triangular diplomacy which isolated it, South Vietnam was &quot;pressurized into accepting an agreement that virtually ensured its collapse.&quot; During negotiations, Kissinger stated that the United States would not intervene militarily 18 months after an agreement, but that it might intervene before that. In Vietnam War historiography, this has been termed the &quot;decent interval.&quot;

<doc id="669966" wikidata="Q684945" url="?curid=669966" title="Kusarigama">
<text>A is a traditional Japanese weapon that consists of a &quot;kama&quot; (the Japanese equivalent of a sickle or billhook) on a kusari-fundo – a type of metal chain (&quot;kusari&quot;) with a heavy iron weight (&quot;fundo&quot;) at the end. The &quot;kusarigama&quot; is said to have been developed during the Muromachi period. The art of handling the kusarigama is called &quot;kusarigamajutsu&quot;.

==History==
The researcher Nawa Yumio believes that the &quot;kusarigama&quot; was based on the &quot;jingama&quot;, a tool that resembles a sickle, which was used to cut through a horse&#x27;s ropes in the case of a fire. The &quot;jingama&quot; could also be used as a weapon and according to Nawa, the tool might have been combined with a , which is a chain that contained a weighted end and a chain around the user&#x27;s wrist. People would wield the weapons with both hands to protect their horses against criminals. Another theory is that the &quot;kusarigama&quot; is based on the &quot;tobiguchi&quot; (:ja:鳶口), which is a type of axe that had a &quot;stout haft and a short pick-like blade&quot;.

There is no evidence of the &quot;kusarigama&quot; being used as a battlefield weapon in mass combat. Swinging its long chain could endanger allies and it would be ineffective against armor. The weapon is at its most useful when wielded against an opponent who attacks with a sword; it is not as useful against a longer weapon such as a spear, a &quot;naginata&quot;, or a &quot;bō&quot;. Perhaps, it was carried as a backup weapon, being light weight and compact. It is likely that the &quot;kusarigama&quot; was common during the Edo period, used against swordsmen and as a training weapon, but it was first created during the Muromachi period.

From the 12th century, until the time of the Tokugawa shogunate, many fighters specialized in the use of the weapon. One of these fighters was Yamada Shinryukan, a man who defeated many swordsmen; he was trapped in a bamboo grove by Araki Mataemon and killed. Yamada did not have enough room in the bamboo grove to swing around the chain of his &quot;kusarigama&quot;. The weapon has been used by ninja. The &quot;kusarigama&quot; has also been used as a &quot;plaything for warriors with time on their hands, and a means of attracting rural students who wished to do something unique in their local festivals&quot;. Samurai women used the weapon as well.

The schools of &quot;kenjutsu&quot;, &quot;jūjutsu&quot;, and &quot;naginatajutsu&quot; taught &quot;kusarigamajutsu&quot;, the art of handling the &quot;kusarigama&quot;. It combined the aspects of &quot;kamajutsu&quot;, &quot;kusarijutsu&quot;, and &quot;fundojutsu&quot;. &quot;Kamajutsu&quot; refers to the &quot;kama&quot; (sickle), &quot;kusarijutsu&quot; refers to the chain, and &quot;fundojutsu&quot; refers to the weight. &quot;Kusari-fundo&quot; refers to the chain combined with the iron weight.

A handle of a &quot;kusarigama&quot; is surrounded by &quot;raden&quot;, which is a lacquer wood inlay that contains pieces of mother-of-pearl. The handle often has metal bands or strips for reinforcement at either end.

Ellis Amdur’s book &quot; Old School: Essays on Japanese Martial Traditions&quot; retells a myth about the origin of the &quot;kusarigama&quot;. In the story, a farmer who used a farming sickle to cut his rice plants was attacked by a samurai. The farmer used the sickle with a chain attachment to defeat the warrior. According to Amdur, trapping an opponent with the chain is not effective, and a farmer&#x27;s sickle would be an awkward weapon. He also states that there is no evidence for peasant use of the &quot;kusarigama&quot; or that it was derived from a farmer&#x27;s tool. However, Donn F. Draeger mentions in his book &quot;Comprehensive Asian Fighting Arts&quot; that the sickle, referring to the &quot;kama&quot;, was originally used for agriculture and later became used as a weapon.

== Methods of use ==
Attacking with the weapon usually entailed swinging the weighted chain in a large circle over one&#x27;s head, and then whipping it forward to entangle an opponent&#x27;s spear, sword, or other weapon, or immobilizing their arms or legs. This allows the kusarigama user to easily rush forward and strike with the sickle.

There are three types of &quot;kusarigama&quot;. The first type has a weapon in the shape of a sickle that has a chain attached to the end of its shaft. The use of the first type depends on the &quot;ryū&quot; (school), with the weapon being held in either hand and its chain and weight being held in the other hand to be swung at the other person. Depending on how easy it is to see the weapon&#x27;s weight move, &quot;it can be deflected or blocked&quot;. One hit with the &quot;kusarigama&quot; is typically not able to stop someone from attacking and the weight needs to be &quot;reeled in&quot; by the wielder again so that a second attack can be made. The second type of &quot;kusarigama&quot; has the chain &quot;attached at the base of the blade&quot; and it is much more powerful than the first type. The second type allows the wielder to use quick attacks and it can continue to be used if the weapon is deflected. It only takes one hand to operate the second type and the other hand can be used for another form of combat. The third type &quot;has a straight blade, hafted at right angles, with a handguard set at the blade side&quot;. The chain is attached to the weapon&#x27;s base and it is controlled with both hands, similar to the first type of &quot;kusarigama&quot;.

==Modern use==
Issue 9 of &quot;This Is Japan&quot; by &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; stated, &quot;Maybe, the most unusual Japanese martial art is that which employs the &quot;kusarigama&quot;. The fact that it has survived through history gives mute testimony to its effectiveness. Yet, the casual observer, untrained in its use, would be apt to regard it as a foolish toy.&quot; A book by Tadashi Yamashita that teaches people how to use the Okinawan kusarigama was advertised in the magazine &quot;Black Belt&quot; in the 1980s.
==Legality==
In the Republic of Ireland, the &quot;kusarigama&quot; is classified as an illegal offensive weapon. The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 in Ireland does not allow the &quot;kusarigama&quot;, and other similar weapons, to be manufactured, imported, or sold. These actions can result in imprisonment for up to seven years.

<doc id="669974" wikidata="Q1156826" url="?curid=669974" title="Northern snakehead">
<text>The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of snakehead fish native to temperate East Asia, in China, Russia, North Korea, and South Korea. Their natural range goes from the Amur River watershed in Siberia and Manchuria down to Hainan. It is an important food fish and one of the most cultivated in its native region, with an estimated produced every year in China and Korea alone. Due to this, the northern snakehead has been exported throughout the world and has managed to establish non-native populations in Central Asia and North America. In the United States, it is found in Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Arkansas and Mississippi.

==Appearance==

The distinguishing features of a northern snakehead include a long dorsal fin with 49–50 rays, an anal fin with 31–32 rays, a small, anteriorly depressed head, the eyes above the middle part of the upper jaw, a large mouth extending well beyond the eye, and villiform teeth in bands, with large canines on the lower jaw and palatines. It is generally reported to reach a length up to , but specimens approaching are known according to Russian ichthyologists. The largest registered by the International Game Fish Association weighs .

Its coloration is a golden tan to pale brown, with dark blotches on the sides and saddle-like blotches across the back. Blotches toward the front tend to separate between top and bottom sections, while rear blotches are more likely to be contiguous. Coloration is nearly the same between juveniles and adults, which is unusual among snakeheads, and is similar to &quot;Channa maculata&quot;, but can be distinguished by two bar-like marks on the caudal peduncle (where the tail attaches); in &quot;C. maculata&quot;, the rear bar is usually complete, with pale bar-like areas before and after, while in &quot;C. argus&quot;, the rear bar is irregular and blotched, with no pale areas around it.

=== Fish similar in appearance ===
The eyespot bowfin (&quot;Amia ocellicauda&quot;) and northern snakehead can be found in the same waters on the swampy tidal coastal plain of the mid-Atlantic United States, such as the Potomac and Delaware River, and are commonly confused with each other. Some contrasting differences in northern snakehead include the lack of a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle, a golden tan to brown coloration with dark splotches, a longer anal fin, a more elongated head, and an upper jaw that is shorter than its lower jaw. Another noticeable difference is that the northern snakehead has scales that continue uniformly from the body through to their head, whereas bowfin heads are smooth and free of scales.

==Behavior==
The northern snakehead is a freshwater species and cannot tolerate salinity in excess of 10 parts per million. It is a facultative air breather; it uses a suprabranchial organ and a bifurcated ventral aorta that permit aquatic and aerial respiration. This unusual respiratory system allows it to live outside of water for several days; it can wriggle its way to other bodies of water or survive being transported by humans. Only young of this species (not adults) may be able to move overland for short distances using wriggling motions. The preferred habitats of this species are stagnant water with mud substrate and aquatic vegetation, or slow, murky, swampy streams; it is primarily piscivorous, but is known to eat crustaceans, other invertebrates, and amphibians.

==Reproduction==

The northern snakehead can double its population in as little as 15 years. It reaches sexual maturity at age three or four, when it will be about long. The eggs are fertilized externally; a female can lay 100,000 eggs a year. Fertilization occurs in shallow water in the early morning. The eggs are yellow and spherical, about in diameter. Eggs hatch after about 1–2 days, but they can take much longer at lower temperatures. The eggs are guarded by the parents until egg absorption, when the eggs are about long.

==Subspecies==
Two subspecies have been recognized:

* &quot;C. a. argus&quot; (Northern snakehead) China and Korea
*&quot;C. a. warpachowskii&quot; (Amur snakehead) eastern Russia.

==As an invasive species==
In its native Asia, the snakehead fish is considered to be an important food fish and for this reason they have been exported to many other regions around the world. They were first introduced to Japan from mainland Asia in the early 1900s, where they have since become a sport fish. The USSR experimented with aquaculture of snakeheads during the mid 20th century in both Europe and Central Asia. In the United States, snakeheads were only cultured in Arkansas, but have managed to establish populations there and several states in the Mid-Atlantic.

=== Japan ===
Snakeheads of Korean stock were first introduced to Japan in the 1920s, and since then have spread to about every suitable body of water on the Japanese mainland.

=== Europe ===
During the Cold War, the USSR imported several different species of fish from eastern Eurasia into Europe for new prospects in aquaculture. Among these fish was the northern snakehead, which came from the Amur River basin and were stocked in various ponds of the Moscow region starting in 1949. These initial experiments were successful and it was recommended that snakehead be stocked into various other waterbodies. However, only one shipment to Czechoslovakia was ever made in 1955, and nothing else after. The snakehead was also introduced to the Volga Delta and various ponds in Yekaterinburg, but are presumed to have failed due to no reports since then.

While the snakeheads were reported to have been breeding in Moscow in the 1950s, they have since disappeared. There are no known populations in Europe in this moment.

=== Central Asia ===
The snakehead has managed to establish themselves in the countries of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, all of which used to be part of the former Soviet Union. More specifically, they are known to be in the Amu Darya, Syr Darya, and Kashka-Darya since the 1960s due to both accidental and intentional releases. Since then, snakeheads have also been introduced to the Sarysu River, Talas River, and Chu River. They have become an important commercial fish in the region, with around 10 metric tons being harvested from just the Talas in 1989.

=== United States ===

The fish first appeared in U.S. news when an alert fisherman discovered one in a Crofton, Maryland, pond in the summer of 2002. The northern snakehead was considered a threat to the Chesapeake Bay watershed, and wary officials took action by draining the pond in an attempt to destroy the species. The action was successful, and two adults and over 100 juvenile fish were found and destroyed. A man admitted having released two adults, which he had purchased from a New York City market, into the pond.

When the northern snakehead was found in Crofton, the piscicide rotenone was added to the three adjacent ponds. The chemical breaks down rapidly, and has a half-life in water of one to three days. This method of containment kills all fish present in a body of water, and its use prevents the spread of the highly invasive snakehead.

In 2004, 19 northern snakeheads were captured in the Potomac River, and they were later confirmed to have become established (i.e., they were breeding). They are somewhat limited to that stretch of the river and its local tributaries, upstream by the Great Falls and downstream by the salinity of the Chesapeake Bay. Tests found they are not related to northern snakeheads found in other waters in the region, alleviating some concern of their overland migration. Northern snakeheads continue to be caught in the river as of 2022.

The northern snakehead has been found in three counties of Florida, and may already be established there. Apparently unestablished specimens have been found in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in New York City, two ponds in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a pond in Massachusetts, and reservoirs in California and North Carolina. In 2008, the northern snakehead was found in drainage ditches in Arkansas as a result of a commercial fish-farming accident. Recent flooding may have allowed the species to spread into the nearby White River, which would allow an eventual population of the fish in the Arkansas River and Mississippi River.

In the summer of 2008, an infestation of the northern snakehead was confirmed in Ridgebury Lake and Catlin Creek near Ridgebury, New York. By August 2008, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) had collected a number of the native fish, and then poisoned the waters with a liquid rotenone formulation. After the poisoning, the NYSDEC had to identify, measure, and additionally process the fish to adhere with New York Bureau of Fisheries procedures before disposal. The treatment plan was operated under several agents, and New York State Police were placed on stand-by in case of protests by local residents.

In April 2013, sightings of the species in Central Park&#x27;s Harlem Meer prompted New York City officials to urge anglers to report and capture any individuals. Ron P. Swegman, author of several angling essays on Central Park&#x27;s ponds, confirmed the species had put both anglers and the State of New York&#x27;s Department of Environmental Protection on high alert.

On 1 June 2013, Caleb Newton, a resident of Spotsylvania County, Virginia, caught a northern snakehead from the junction of Aquia Creek and the Potomac River, beating the previous world record of caught in 2004, in Miki, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan.

In late 2013, authorities in Maryland and Virginia were counting snakeheads in the Chesapeake Bay to better understand the impact of the introduction of the fish to the local ecosystem. The Commonwealth of Virginia has criminalized the &quot;introduc[tion]&quot; of snakeheads into the state without specific authorization, although the relevant statute does not explain whether mere importation is sufficient to constitute &quot;introduc[tion] into the Commonwealth&quot; or whether instead release into the environment is required.

On May 20, 2014, Luis Aragon of Triangle, Virginia, caught a northern snakehead, which was officially listed as the biggest ever caught on rod and reel, according to the International Game Fish Association.

On May 20, 2016, Emory &quot;Dutch&quot; Baldwin of Indian Head, Maryland, boated an northern snakehead in a tidal marsh of the Potomac using archery tackle. This fish was listed as the state sport record in Maryland by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

On the night of May 24, 2018, Andrew “Andy” Fox of Mechanicsville, Maryland, shot a northern snakehead with a bow and arrow, which was officially listed as the biggest ever shot according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. The record-breaking northern snakehead weighed , with a length of . The snakehead was shot in Mattawoman Creek in Charles County, Maryland, near Indian Head.

In October 2019, a number of northern snakeheads were found in a pond on private property in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

In August 2021, a snakehead weighing was caught in a reservoir in Canton, Massachusetts.

In 2024 a snakehead was confirmed at the Duck Creek Conservation Area in southeast Missouri.

A new concern is that this fish&#x27;s spreading is getting close to the Great Lakes, which it may enter and disrupt that ecosystem.

=== Canada ===

In 2012, a suspected northern snakehead was found in a pond in Burnaby, British Columbia, but further study revealed that it had been released three months or less before its capture and that it was a blotched snakehead or perhaps a hybrid involving that species. Before its exact identity was revealed, the government of British Columbia introduced legislation banning the possession of snakeheads and several other potentially invasive species. However, unlike the northern snakehead, which could establish a population in parts of Canada, the blotched snakehead generally lives only in warmer waters than those found in Canada.

==World record==
According to the International Game Fish Association, Damien Cook, caught a world-record northern snakehead in Dorchester County, Maryland, United States, on 5 July 2023

==In traditional culture==
Northern snakeheads are respected among some Chinese fishermen for their virtue, as parent snakefish are known to sacrifice themselves to protect their young. The young fish are said to rush to feed upon their mother after she gives birth and is temporarily unable to catch prey.

<text>William Roger Dean (born 31 August 1944) is an English artist, designer, and publisher. He began painting posters and album covers for musicians in the late 1960s. The groups for whom he did the most art are the English rock bands Yes and Asia.

The covers often feature exotic fantasy landscapes. His work has sold more than 150 million copies worldwide.

== Early life ==
William Roger Dean was born on 31 August 1944 in Ashford, Kent. His mother studied dress design at Canterbury School of Art before her marriage and his father was an engineer in the British Army. He has three siblings, brother Martyn and sisters Penny and Philippa. Much of Dean&#x27;s childhood was spent in Greece, Cyprus, and, from age 12 to 15, Hong Kong, so his father could carry out army duties. Dean was very keen on natural history as a child, and Chinese landscape art and feng shui became particular influences on him during his time in Hong Kong. He has cited landscape, &quot;and the pathways through it&quot;, as his greatest influence and source of inspiration.

In 1959, after the family had returned to England, Dean attended Ashford Grammar School followed by his entry in 1961 to the Canterbury College of Art studying silversmithing and furniture design and graduated with a National Diploma in Design. He was removed from a life drawing class by the principal for being &quot;young and impressionable&quot;, and was informed he could not take it due to maths and physics being his other subjects, leading a switch to studying industrial design. As the school was trying to become accredited in the subject, Dean bypassed its foundation level course but disliked the way the subject was taught and questioned the teachers as to why people had to live in &quot;boxes&quot; and their response in that &quot;form follows function&quot;.

Towards the end of the course at Canterbury, Dean was faced with the option of pursuing either architecture or industrial design; one of his tutors thought neither were for him, and recommended that Dean study at the Royal College of Art in London. He enrolled at the college in 1965 to study furniture design and became a student of Professor David Pye. Among his research was the &quot;psychology of architecture&quot; and what made people feel comfortable in buildings. He did a thesis about &quot;producing a sense of tranquillity in domestic architecture&quot;. He graduated from the college in 1968 with a masters first degree honours, and won a silver medal for &quot;work of special distinction&quot;. By this time, Dean was interested in &quot;designing the future [...] boxes for people to live in&quot;. He considered Rick Griffin&#x27;s artwork for &quot;Aoxomoxoa&quot; (1969) by the Grateful Dead as his &quot;first big visual shock&quot; and bought the album prior to owning a record player.

== Career ==
=== 1960s ===
Among Dean&#x27;s first successes was his sea urchin chair design which spawned from his research at the Royal College and completed in 1967. He filed a patent for it in the following year. It has been considered to be a predecessor to the bean bag, whereby the chair compresses and fully adapts to the shape and size of the user. The design was completed when Dean was one of the few students picked from the Royal College to design and make objects in famed designer Cherrill Scheer&#x27;s factory. The chair remains one of Scheer&#x27;s favourite pieces. It is now a part of the permanent collection at the Victoria and Albert Museum.

In 1968, during his third year at the Royal College, Dean was assigned a project which involved the design of a contemporary landscape seating area of the upstairs disco at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in Soho. This led to the design of his first album cover, &quot;Gun&quot; (1968) by rock band The Gun, after owner Ronnie Scott and business partner Jimmy Parsons asked him to use a demonic-themed design that Dean originally made in his sketchbook for his thesis, for the album&#x27;s cover. Dean revisited the original design and was paid around £5,000 for his work, which was more than he had earned with architecture, and with much less effort. He decided to venture into cover design not purely for the money, but its wider audience and its use &quot;as a propaganda tool [...] showing people what might be and what could be&quot;. Dean picked up work where he could, including covers for various jazz artists for Vertigo Records which he disliked, calling them &quot;austere exercises&quot; and too restrictive for the ideas he wished to convey. The experience led Dean to establish a commission before starting work he wanted to do, leading to a short period of financial hardship. At the same time he wanted to release a book on architecture, but faced rejection from 27 different publishers.

=== 1970s ===
Dean designed the logo to the independent label Fly Records in 1970. This led to a single for their musician Marc Bolan, which involved typesetting the liner notes and lyrics, but Dean had not performed typesetting before and completed the inserts by hand with the assistance of a graphic designer, in order to show the printing staff where the text was to be placed. The positive reaction Dean received from his style of writing led to him handwriting the text for further Bolan singles. This was a similar case for Dean&#x27;s design for &quot;Clear Blue Sky&quot; (1970) by Clear Blue Sky, where a painting had been completed except the typesetting, &quot;So to bluff my way through the meeting I had to handwrite it all and hope they would never ask about it&quot;. The label&#x27;s staffers were enthusiastic, which gave Dean the confidence to pursue more handwriting, logo, and graphic work.

By 1971, Dean&#x27;s desire to produce artwork for rock bands had grown though he continued to pursue architecture and headed a small exhibition of his work in Florence. Following discussions with A&amp;R man David Howells, who had assigned Dean the sleeve for &quot;The Gun&quot;, Dean agreed to work on the cover of &quot;Osibisa&quot; (1971) by Afro-rock band Osibisa. The design is a result of a brief that Dean described as &quot;credible African fairytale imagery&quot; and features &quot;flying elephants and not architecture&quot;, which became an early representation of the style he later achieved fame with. Dean considered the job a breakthrough for his career as the design was made into a poster by the Big &#x27;O&#x27; poster company which sold a large number of copies. He later said, &quot;From that point on I could do what I wanted&quot;.

In mid-1971, during his search for work affiliated with rock bands, Dean sent a portfolio to numerous executives including Phil Carson, the European General Manager of Atlantic Records. Carson took an interest in using Dean for one of his rock acts, Yes, and hired Dean for the cover of Yes&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), which marked the beginning of an association with the band to the present day. Dean pitched a story on a creation myth rather than a particular image for it, &quot;about a child who dreamt they were living on a planet that was breaking up, so they had to build a space ark to find another planet to live on. And they towed all the little bits of the planet with them&quot;. In 1972, he designed the band&#x27;s logo while travelling on the Brighton Belle train, which has been used on most of their albums since &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972). In addition to their covers, Dean and his brother Martyn worked on the stage design for Yes from 1973 to 1976, 1980, 1989, and 2004. The tour for &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973) featured a nationwide merchandising campaign including posters and t-shirts that led to the creation of the production company Brockum.

In 1972, Dean designed the logo for Richard Branson&#x27;s newly established Virgin Records label, following several labels and designs he produced for Branson&#x27;s Virgin record shop in London, such as the carrier bags. A photographic variation of Dean&#x27;s Virgin logo was used for its subsidiary label, Caroline Records. In 1973, Vertigo Records changed the design of its record labels from a spiral pattern to a pictorial one by Dean that featured two spaceships. While working on the art for &quot;Yessongs&quot; (1973), Dean and his printers Tinsley Robor secured a patent for &quot;a way of going from gatefold to any number of pages, folded out of one piece of card&quot;. In the late 1970s, Dean had an idea for &quot;Living in the Third Millennium&quot;, a thirteen episode television show about the designs and technological challenges of the future, yet it never made it to production due to budget constraints.

=== 1980s–present ===
In the 1980s, Dean&#x27;s output focused on other areas, including stage design, architecture, and video game art. He was approached by Italian film producer Dino De Laurentiis to design the costumes for &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; (1980), but declined as film work required him to relinquish the ownership of his designs. In 1981, he collaborated with his brother Martyn on the Tectonic House, an environmentally-friendly and economic home that was displayed at the annual International Ideal Home Exhibition in Birmingham. The idea spawned from two ideas–Dean&#x27;s earlier designs for a bedroom intended for the safety of children, and Martyn&#x27;s &quot;retreat pod&quot; from 1970 that Stanley Kubrick borrowed for his film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971). The project has developed into its current name, Home for Life, and the non-working prototype contains no straight edges or right angles. In the early 2000s, the cost to produce one was estimated to be $75,000–$80,000. Although several local British governments have expressed interest in the project, none have come into fruition. In 2003, a project involving the construction of 264 villas, chalets, and apartments designed by Dean on a 65-acre site near Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire had entered the planning stage.

In 1982, readers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted Dean&#x27;s cover for Asia&#x27;s debut studio album as the second greatest album cover of all time, behind &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; (1967) by the Beatles. His logo for the band featured hard edges and sharp corners on purpose, as a contrast to the had produced for Yes.

Dean&#x27;s first design for a video game was &quot;The Black Onyx&quot; (1984), which was a collaboration with comic artist Michael Kaluta. It marked the beginning of a series of designs Dean produced for Henk Rogers, who designed the game. The project involved Dean and Kaluta producing an estimated 4,000 drawings for the game, including ideas for its animation, story, music, and motion capture. Dean went on to produce the cover artwork for several Psygnosis games, including &quot;Obliterator&quot; (1988) and &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot; (1989). Dean redesigned the Tetris logo which led to the design of the cover art for &quot;Tetris Worlds&quot; (2001).
In 1996, Dean produced artwork for a poster distributed nationwide to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Starbucks.

Dean received an honorary doctorate from the Academy of Art University in San Francisco in 2002, and an honorary fellowship from the Arts University Bournemouth in 2009.

In 2013, Dean filed a $50 million lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in New York, alleging that director James Cameron had plagiarised 14 of his original images in the film &quot;Avatar&quot; (2009). Although the filmmakers admitted to being influenced by his work, a judge dismissed the case. Dean felt the judge failed to properly examine the evidence provided. &quot;I showed half a dozen different details that they copied specifically from it that didn&#x27;t occur in nature. But the judge, reverting to this idea that the work has to be taken as a whole and you don&#x27;t go into detail, he took all my evidence out. Then when he came back to the concept that I&#x27;m saying they copied in detail things that they claimed I&#x27;d taken from nature, my evidence was gone.&quot;

In 2013, Dean received a Gold Badge of Merit from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors.

In March 2021, Dean released his first artwork on the digital art auction platform Nifty Gateway, featuring non-fungible token art pieces. In 2022, an exhibition of works by Dean and his daughter Freyja was displayed at the Haight Street Art Center in San Francisco, entited The Secret Path. Later in 2022, an immersive exhibition featuring Dean&#x27;s artwork presented in high definition 4D audio and video with laser projections was held at the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts, also in San Francisco.

Dean has two permanent galleries, his largest at Trading Boundaries, East Sussex in the UK and the other at The San Francisco Art Exchange. Both galleries display original works and limited edition prints, sketches and drawings.

==Album covers==
Known primarily for the dreamy, other-worldly scenes he has created for Yes, Asia, Budgie, Uriah Heep, Gentle Giant and other bands, Dean has described himself primarily as a landscape painter. Characteristic landscapes show graceful stone arches (as shown in &quot;Arches Mist&quot;) or floating islands, while many paintings portray organic-seeming habitats, such as on the cover of &quot;Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe&quot;. Though he primarily works with watercolour paints, many of his paintings make use of multiple media, including gouache, ink, enamel, crayon and collage. In addition to his cover paintings, Dean is respected for his calligraphic work, designing logos and titles to go with his paintings.

Dean was friends with album cover designer Storm Thorgerson of Hipgnosis and the two lived in the same building after leaving university. He recalled a time when they collaborated on an album cover, but it turned out to be &quot;a complete failure&quot;. The rise of the compact disc in the 1980s led to what Dean described as a decline in combining music with art, with the jewel case looking &quot;tacky&quot; and a way for record companies sacrificing quality to save money. He cites the early CD reissue of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; by Yes as one that particularly affected him as his inner sleeve artwork was missing, replaced with black and white text.

== Personal life ==
Dean lives in Lewes, East Sussex. He has a daughter, Freyja, who also an artist and designer and is the inspiration behind Dean&#x27;s 1987 painting &quot;Freyja&#x27;s Castle&quot;. The pair have collaborated on work, exhibitions and stage productions. She produced the cover art for Osibisa&#x27;s album &quot;Osee Yee&quot; (2009).

== Recognition in other media ==
Dean is mentioned in the 1987 song &quot;Dickie Davies Eyes&quot; by English band Half Man Half Biscuit.

On 19 August 2016, the Isle of Man Post Office issued a series of 6 stamps featuring Dean&#x27;s artwork:
* &quot;Meeting Place&quot; – produced exclusively for the stamp issue
* &quot;Blind Owl Late Landing&quot; – features the unreleased &quot;Blind Owl&quot; album artwork

* &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; – from the Yes album of the same name
* &quot;Sea of Light&quot; comes from the Uriah Heep album of the same name

Dean has had a long relationship with the Isle of Man, and especially with its long-term resident Rick Wakeman, keyboardist of Yes, for which Dean has designed several pieces of album artwork.

The First Day Cover (FDC) was also issued in a limited 750-issue run which were signed by Dean (this cover was issued on 2 September 2016).

On 20 August 2016, an exhibition of Dean&#x27;s masterpieces went on display at the Manx Museum.

A special FDC was issued on 25 March 2018, to celebrate 50 years of Yesthis was a different cover to the August 2016 one, and was postmarked in Gold to record this historic event and signed personally by Dean who has created a special 50th Anniversary logo. A limited edition of 1000 signed covers were issued.

Dean&#x27;s artwork was featured in a collaboration with Italian fashion house Valentino for their spring/summer 2020 men&#x27;s collection.

In the manga JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean the stand Dragon&#x27;s Dream is named after Roger Dean&#x27;s art book of the same name

<text>Gottfried Freiherr van Swieten (29 October 1733 – 29 March 1803) was a Dutch-born Austrian diplomat, librarian, and government official who served the Holy Roman Empire during the 18th century. He was an enthusiastic amateur musician and is best remembered today as the patron of several great composers of the Classical era, including Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach, Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

==Life and career==

Van Swieten was born Godefridus Bernardus &quot;Godfried&quot; van Swieten in Leiden and grew up in the Dutch Republic to the age of 11. His father, Gerard van Swieten, was a physician who achieved a high reputation for raising standards of scientific research and instruction in the field of medicine. In 1745, the elder Van Swieten agreed to become personal physician to the Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa and moved with his family to Vienna, where he also became the director of the court library and served in other government posts. The young Van Swieten was educated for national service in an elite Jesuit school, the Theresianum.

===As diplomat===

According to the musicologist Daniel Heartz, the young Van Swieten had &quot;excelled in his studies&quot; and was fluent in many languages. Thus it was natural that he would pursue (following a brief stint in the civil service) a career as a diplomat. His first posting was to Brussels (1755–1757), then Paris (1760–1763), Warsaw (1763–1764) and ultimately (as ambassador) to the court of Frederick the Great of Prussia in Berlin (1770–77).

The last posting involved serious responsibility. Frederick had previously defeated Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), seizing from her the territory of Silesia; and had successfully defended his conquest in the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763). Van Swieten was ambassador during the First Partition of Poland (1772), in which much of the territory of this nation was annexed by the more powerful neighboring empires of Austria, Russia, and Prussia. Austria rather unrealistically wanted Silesia (and other territories) back as part of the terms of the partition. According to Abert, it was Van Swieten&#x27;s &quot;thankless task&quot; to negotiate on this basis; the 60-year-old Frederick replied to him: &quot;That&#x27;s the sort of suggestion you could make if I had gout in the brain, but I&#x27;ve only got it in my legs.&quot; Van Swieten shifted the negotiations to his backup plan and the Partition went forward with Silesia remaining Prussian.

During this period of his career Van Swieten assiduously cultivated his musical interests. His supervisor in Brussels, Count Cobenzl, reported in 1756 that &quot;music takes up the best part of his time&quot;. In Berlin, Van Swieten studied with Johann Philipp Kirnberger, a former pupil of J. S. Bach, and was part of the musical circle of Princess Anna Amalia, where the music of Bach and Handel was played and admired.

===As librarian===
On his return to Vienna in 1777, Van Swieten was appointed as the prefect of the Imperial Library, a post which had been vacant for five years since his father&#x27;s death. Van Swieten remained imperial librarian for the rest of his life.

As librarian Van Swieten introduced the world&#x27;s first card catalog (1780). Libraries had had catalogs before, in the form of bound volumes. Van Swieten&#x27;s innovation of using cards permitted new entries to be freely added in a conveniently searchable order. Card catalogs were soon adopted elsewhere, notably in Revolutionary France.

Van Swieten also expanded the library&#x27;s collection, notably with books on science, as well as older books from the libraries of monasteries that had been dissolved under the decrees of Emperor Joseph II.

===In politics===

In 1780, when Joseph II came to the throne, Van Swieten&#x27;s career reached its peak of success. He was appointed a Councillor of State and Director of the State Education Commission in 1781, then also as Director of a new Censorship Commission in 1782. Van Swieten was strongly sympathetic to the program of reforms which Joseph sought to impose on his empire, and his position in government was a critical one, considered by Volkmar Braunbehrens (1990) to be the equivalent of being minister of culture.

Edward Olleson describes the political situation: &quot;The projected reforms of the educational system ... were the most fundamental of all. Joseph&#x27;s goal of building up a middle class with a political responsibility towards the State depended on great advances in elementary education, and on the universities. Van Swieten&#x27;s liberal views fitted him to the task of implementing the Emperor&#x27;s plans.&quot; Olleson adds that, because Joseph&#x27;s reforms increased the freedom of the press, a &quot;flood of pamphlets&quot; was published critical of the Imperial government—thus increasing Van Swieten&#x27;s responsibilities in supervising the censorship apparatus of the government. His letters of the time report an extremely heavy workload.

In 1784 Van Swieten proposed that the Holy Roman Empire should have a copyright law; such a law had already been in effect in England since 1709 (&quot;see: History of copyright&quot;). Van Swieten&#x27;s suggestion was overruled by the Emperor. The historian Nicholas Till suggests that had Van Swieten&#x27;s law been implemented, the career of his protégé Mozart as an independent musician might have gone much more successfully. Van Swieten&#x27;s rise to power eventually met with obstacles and trouble. In 1787, the Emperor launched a &quot;disastrous, futile, and costly&quot; war against the Turks, which put Austrian society in turmoil and undermined his earlier efforts at reform. Till writes:

Joseph attempted to pass the blame for events on to ... Van Swieten. As President of the Censorship Commission, [he] had been more liberal than Joseph was willing to countenance. ... As Minister for Education [he] had aimed to strip education of any religious character; he was more concerned about the dangers of religious orthodoxy than heresy, and believed that students should be taught a system of secular values based upon &quot;philosophy&quot;. But his reforms, which indicated a far more radical rejection of religious education than Joseph was prepared to accept, had failed. In 1790, Joseph wrote to Chancellor Kolowrat expressing his discontent: &quot;since an essential aspect of the education of young people, namely religion and morality, is treated far too lightly, since ... no feeling for one&#x27;s true duties is being developed, the state is deprived of the essential advantages of having raised right-thinking and well-behaved citizens.&quot;

The Emperor was already terminally ill when he wrote the quoted letter, and died later that year. He was replaced by his more conservative brother Leopold, which further undermined Van Swieten&#x27;s position. A &quot;bitter&quot; (Olleson) power struggle took place which Van Swieten ultimately lost. He was relieved of his commission post on 5 December 1791, coincidentally the day his protégé Mozart died.

===As composer===

Van Swieten&#x27;s strong interest in music extended to the creation of his compositions. While in Paris he staged a comic opera of his own composition. He also composed other operas as well as symphonies. These works are not considered of high quality and are seldom if ever performed today. The &quot;Grove Dictionary&quot; opines that &quot;the chief characteristics of [his] conservative, three-movement symphonies are tautology and paucity of invention ... As a composer Van Swieten is insignificant.&quot;

Known works include three comic operas: &quot;Les talents à la mode&quot;, &quot;Colas, toujours Colas&quot;, and the lost &quot;La chercheuse d&#x27;esprit&quot;. He also wrote ten symphonies, of which seven survive.

===Other===

Van Swieten was well off financially, though by no means as wealthy as the great princes of the Empire. He had inherited money from his father, and he was also well paid for his government posts. Braunbehrens estimates his income as about &quot;ten times Mozart&#x27;s&quot;, which would make it (very roughly) 20,000 florins per year.

Van Swieten never married. Unlike his father, who remained a Protestant after coming to Austria, Gottfried converted to Roman Catholicism, the state religion of the empire.

Van Swieten owned &quot;Art of Painting&quot; by Vermeer, which he inherited from his father. At the time it was not known that the painting was by Vermeer.

===Death===
Van Swieten died in 1803 in Vienna.

==Relation to classical composers==

The evidence suggests that Van Swieten&#x27;s relationship with the great composers of his day was primarily one of patronage. This means that the composers did not work for Van Swieten on salary or commission, but received payments from him from time to time in the manner of a tip. Thus, Joseph Haydn remarked to his biographer Griesinger that &quot;He patronized me occasionally with several ducats.&quot; This was a common way of paying musicians in the age of aristocracy; Haydn had received similar payments from his employer Nikolaus Esterházy, though he also drew a salary. The patronage system also financed the early travels of the Mozart family.

The relationship between patron and artist was not one of social equals. An 1801 letter of Haydn to Van Swieten, by then his longtime collaborator, used no second person pronouns, instead addressing the Baron as &quot;Your Excellency&quot;; presumably this reflected their everyday practice.

===Mozart===
Van Swieten first met Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1768, when he was 35 years old and Mozart a boy of 11. The Mozart family was visiting Vienna, hoping to achieve further fame and income following the earlier completion of their Grand Tour of Europe. According to Mozart&#x27;s father Leopold, Van Swieten was involved in the early planning of Wolfgang&#x27;s ill-fated opera &quot;La finta semplice&quot; (the opera was later blocked by intrigues, and could be performed only in Salzburg).

In 1781, shortly after Mozart had moved to Vienna, Van Swieten met him again: at the salon of Countess Thun, Mozart played extracts from his recent opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, with Van Swieten and other important officials in the audience; this event helped instigate Mozart&#x27;s commission for the opera &quot;Die Entführung aus dem Serail&quot;, his first great success as a composer.

====Sharing works by Bach and Handel====

By 1782, Van Swieten had invited Mozart to visit him regularly, in order to inspect and play his manuscripts of works by J. S. Bach and Handel, which he had collected during his diplomatic service in Berlin. As Mozart wrote to his father Leopold (10 April 1782):

I go every Sunday at twelve o&#x27;clock to the Baron van Swieten, where nothing is played but Handel and Bach. I am collecting at the moment the fugues of Bach—not only of Sebastian, but also of Emanuel and Friedemann.

Others also attended these gatherings, and Van Swieten gave Mozart the task of transcribing a number of fugues for instrumental ensembles so that they could be performed before the assembled company. Mozart also sat at the keyboard and rendered the orchestral scores of Handel&#x27;s oratorios in a spontaneous keyboard reduction (while, according to Joseph Weigl, also singing one of the choral parts and correcting errors of the other singers).

It appears that encountering the work of the two great Baroque masters had a very strong effect on Mozart. Olleson suggests that the process took place in two stages. Mozart responded first with rather direct imitations, writing fugues and suites in the style of his models. These works &quot;have the character of studies in contrapuntal technique.&quot; Many were left incomplete, and even the completed ones are not often performed today; Olleson suggests they have &quot;a dryness which is absent from most of [Mozart&#x27;s] music.&quot; Later, Mozart assimilated Bach and Handel&#x27;s music more fully into his style, where it played a role in the creation of some of his most widely admired works. Of these, Olleson mentions the C minor Mass (1784) and the chorale prelude sung by the two armored men in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (1791).

====The Society of Associated Cavaliers====

The keyboard-accompanied, one-on-a-part performances of Handel oratorios in Van Swieten&#x27;s rooms whetted the interest of Van Swieten and his colleagues in full-scale performances of these works. To this end, in 1786 Van Swieten organized the &quot;Gesellschaft der Associierten&quot; (&quot;Society of Associated Cavaliers&quot; or &quot;Society of Noblemen&quot;), an organization of music-loving nobles. With the financial backing of this group, he was able to stage full-scale performances of major works. Generally, these concerts were first given in van Swieten&#x27;s private rooms in the Vienna Hofburg, then in a public performance in the Burgtheater or Jahn&#x27;s Hall.

Mozart took on the task of conducting these concerts in 1788. He had previously been too busy with other tasks, but with a decline in his career prospects elsewhere he was willing to take up the post. In addition to having him conduct, the Gesellschaft commissioned Mozart to prepare four works by Handel for performance according to contemporary taste:

* &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;, performed in (approximately) November 1788 in Jahn&#x27;s Hall.
* the oratorio &quot;Der Messias&quot; after &quot;Messiah&quot;, for which Mozart wrote new parts for flutes, clarinets, bassoons, horns, and trombones, as well as more notes for the timpani (1789).
* the &quot;Ode for St Cecilia’s Day&quot; (1790)
* &quot;Alexander’s Feast&quot; (1790)

Van Swieten was responsible for the translations from English into German of the libretti for these works, a task he would perform later on for Haydn (see below).

The Gesellschaft&#x27;s concerts were an important source of income for Mozart during this time when he was experiencing severe financial worries. Van Swieten&#x27;s loyalty to Mozart at this time is also indicated by one of Mozart&#x27;s letters of 1789, in which he reported that he had solicited subscriptions to a projected concert series (as he had previously done with great success in the mid-1780s) and found that—after two weeks—the Baron was still the only subscriber.

====Mozart&#x27;s death and aftermath====

When Mozart died (1:00 am on 5 December 1791), Van Swieten attended his home and made the funeral arrangements. He may have temporarily helped support the surviving Mozarts, as Constanze&#x27;s correspondence in several places mentions his &quot;generosity&quot;. On 2 January 1793, he sponsored a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; as a benefit concert for Constanze; it yielded a profit of 300 ducats, a substantial sum. He was also reported to have helped arrange for the education of Mozart&#x27;s son Karl in Prague.

===Haydn===
In 1776, during a visit home to Vienna from his posting in Berlin, Van Swieten offered encouragement to the 43-year-old Joseph Haydn, who at the time was vexed by the hostile reception his work was receiving from certain Berlin critics. Van Swieten told him that his works were nevertheless in high demand in Berlin. Haydn mentioned this appreciatively in his 1776 autobiographical sketch.

In 1790, with the death of Nikolaus Esterházy, Haydn became semi-independent of his long-time employers the Esterházy family. He moved to Vienna and thus became more free to accept Van Swieten&#x27;s patronage. Olleson suggests that Haydn participated in the Handel concerts of the Gesellschaft der Associierten, and notes that already in 1793, Van Swieten was trying to get him to write an oratorio (to a text by ). In 1794, when Haydn set off for London on his second journey there, he rode in a carriage provided to him by Van Swieten.

On his return the following year, Haydn and Van Swieten developed a close working relationship, with Van Swieten serving as his librettist and artistic adviser. The collaboration began in 1795/1796 with the small oratorio version of &quot;The Seven Last Words of Christ&quot;. This work was composed by Haydn as an orchestral piece in 1785. In the course of his second London journey, in Passau, he had heard a revised version amplified to include a chorus, prepared by the Passau Kapellmeister Joseph Friebert. Liking the idea, Haydn then prepared his own choral version, with Van Swieten revising the lyrics used by Friebert.

Haydn and Van Swieten then moved on to larger projects: the full-scale oratorios &quot;The Creation&quot; (1798) and &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1801). Van Swieten translated (from English to German) and adapted the source material, which came from John Milton&#x27;s poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; and James Thomson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;, respectively. He also translated in the reverse direction, putting the German back into English in a way that would fit the rhythm of Haydn&#x27;s music. This reverse translation, though often awkward, enabled the first published editions of these oratorios to serve both German- and English-speaking audiences.

In the margins of his libretti, Van Swieten made many specific artistic suggestions to Haydn about how various passages should be musically set, suggestions which in general Haydn &quot;observed closely&quot; (Olleson). One example is the moving episode in &quot;The Creation&quot; in which God tells the newly created beasts to be fruitful and multiply. Van Swieten&#x27;s paraphrase of Genesis reads:
&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;
Seid fruchtbar alle,
Mehret euch!
Bewohner der Luft, vermehret euch, und singt auf jedem Aste!
Mehret euch, ihr Flutenbewohner
Und füllet jede Tiefe!
Seid fruchtbar, wachset, und mehret euch!
Erfreuet euch in eurem Gott!&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;
Be fruitful all
And multiply.
Dwellers of the air, multiply and sing on every branch.
Multiply, ye dwellers of the tides,
And fill every deep.
Be fruitful, grow, multiply,
And rejoice in your God!&lt;/poem&gt;

Haydn&#x27;s musical setting stems from a suggestion of Van Swieten&#x27;s that the words should be sung by the bass soloist over an unadorned bass line. However, he only partly followed this suggestion, and after pondering, added to his bass line a rich layer of four-part harmony for divided cellos and violas, crucial to the final result.

The premieres of the three oratorios &quot;The Seven Last Words&quot;, &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot; all took place under the auspices of the &quot;Gesellschaft der Associierten&quot;, who also provided financial guarantees needed for Haydn to undertake long-term projects.

===Beethoven===
Van Swieten was a patron and supporter of Ludwig van Beethoven during his early years in Vienna. Beethoven&#x27;s experience with Van Swieten was in some ways parallel to Mozart&#x27;s about 12 years earlier. He visited the Baron in his home, where there were still regular gatherings centred around the music of Bach and Handel. Beethoven&#x27;s early biographer Anton Schindler wrote:

The evening gatherings at Swieten&#x27;s home had a marked effect on Beethoven, for it was here that he first became acquainted with the music of Handel and Bach. He generally had to stay long after the other guests had departed, for his elderly host was musically insatiable and would not let the young pianist go until he had &#x27;blessed the evening&#x27; with several Bach fugues.

Schindler&#x27;s testimony is not generally trusted by modern musicologists. Indeed, Swieten&#x27;s soirées were not Beethoven&#x27;s first encounter with Bach&#x27;s fugues. Beethoven&#x27;s teacher, Christian Gottlob Neefe wrote in a letter promoting Beethoven&#x27;s abilities: &quot;a boy of eleven years ... plays chiefly &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; of Sebastian Bach, which Herr Neefe put into his hands. Whoever knows this collection of preludes and fugues in all the keys – which might almost be called the non plus ultra of our art – will know what this means.&quot; However, in the case of Swieten&#x27;s invitation there is concrete evidence preserved in the form of a letter from Swieten to Beethoven. The letter dates from 1794, when Beethoven was 23 years old:
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
Monday, 15 December
Herr Beethoven
Alstergasse No. 15
c/o Prince Lichnowsky
If you are not hindered this coming Wednesday, I wish to see you at my home at 8:30 in the evening with your nightcap in your bag. Give me your immediate answer.
Swieten&lt;/poem&gt;

Albrecht explains &quot;nightcap&quot; as follows: &quot;This aspect of Swieten&#x27;s invitation was as much practical and considerate as it was hospitable: if Beethoven had returned home after the citywide 9 p.m. curfew, he would have had to pay Lichnowsky&#x27;s turnkey a fee to let him in the locked house doors.&quot;

Exposure to Bach and Handel&#x27;s music seems to have been important to Beethoven just as it had been to Mozart. Ferdinand Ries later wrote, &quot;Of all composers, Beethoven valued Mozart and Handel most highly, then [J.] S. Bach. ... Whenever I found him with music in his hands, or saw some lying on his desk, it was certain to be a composition by one of these idols.&quot;

In 1801, Beethoven dedicated his First Symphony to Van Swieten.

===Other associations===

Earlier in his career, while in Berlin, Van Swieten had also supported the career of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Bach wrote the six Symphonies for String Orchestra (1773; H. 657–662) on commission from Van Swieten; according to Goodwin and Clark, the commission specified that &quot;the composer&#x27;s creative imagination might have free rein, unfettered by any regard for technical difficulties&quot;. The third set of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Sonaten für Kenner und Liebhaber&quot; (1781) is dedicated to Van Swieten.

Johann Nikolaus Forkel, the first biographer of Bach, dedicated his book to Van Swieten.

==Van Swieten and the social customs of music==

Van Swieten is thought to have played a role in changing the social customs of music. As William Weber points out, in Van Swieten&#x27;s time, it was still the normal practice for performers to play mostly newly composed music; often music that had been written by the performers themselves. The practice of cultivating the music of previous decades and centuries only gradually increased. By about 1870, older works had come to dominate the scene.

This shift began in Van Swieten&#x27;s century. Some of the early cases of performers playing older music are pointed out by Weber: &quot;In France the tragedies lyriques of Jean-Baptiste Lully and his successors were performed regularly up through the 1770s. In England music of the sixteenth century was revived in the Academy of Ancient Music, and many of the works of George Frideric Handel remained in performance after his death in 1759.&quot; As Weber notes, Van Swieten was one of the pioneers of this trend, particularly in his work reviving the music of Bach and Handel, and in his encouragement of contemporary composers to learn from the old masters and create new work that would be inspired by them.

Van Swieten expressed some of his views about the value of earlier music in the pages of the first volume of the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;:

I belong, as far as music is concerned, to a generation that considered it necessary to study an art form thoroughly and systematically before attempting to practice it. I find in such a conviction food for the spirit and for the heart, and I return to it for strength every time I am oppressed by new evidence of decadence in the arts. My principal comforters at such times are Handel and the Bachs and those few great men of our own day who, taking these as their masters, follow resolutely in the same quest for greatness and truth.

DeNora describes the devotion to earlier masters as a &quot;fringe&quot; view during the 1780s, but eventually others were following Swieten&#x27;s lead, particularly with the success of &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot;. The music publisher Johann Ferdinand von Schönfeld wrote in 1796:

[Van Swieten is], as it were, looked upon as a patriarch of music. He has taste only for the great and exalted. ... When he attends a concert our semi-connoisseurs never take their eyes off him, seeking to read in his features, not always intelligible to everyone, what ought to be their opinion of the music.

A corollary of a &quot;taste for the great and exalted&quot; is the idea that concert audiences should maintain silence, so that each note can be heard by all. This was not the received view in the 18th century, but was clearly Van Swieten&#x27;s opinion. In his 1856 Mozart biography, Otto Jahn reported the following anecdote from Sigismund Neukomm:

[He] exerted all his influence in the cause of music, even for so subordinate an end as to enforce silence and attention during musical performances. Whenever a whispered conversation arose among the audience, his excellence would rise from his seat in the first row, draw himself up to his full majestic height, measure the offenders with a long, serious look and then very slowly resume his seat. The proceeding never failed of its effect.

==Assessment==

Van Swieten has not fared well in assessments of his personal demeanor. In a frequently reprinted remark, Haydn remarked to Georg August Griesinger that Van Swieten&#x27;s symphonies were &quot;as stiff as the man himself.&quot; He maintained a firm social distance between himself and the composers he patronized, a distance rooted in the system of aristocracy still in force in Austria in his day. Sigismund Neukomm wrote that he was &quot;not so much a friend as a very self-opinionated patron of Haydn and Mozart&quot;. Olleson suggests that &quot;in his own time Van Swieten won little affection&quot; (adding: &quot;but almost universal respect.&quot;). He also was not close to his fellow aristocrats; although his public roles in music and government were prominent, he avoided salon society, and after 1795 expressed content that he lived in &quot;complete retirement&quot;.

Concerning Van Swieten&#x27;s contributions to music, posthumous judgment seems most critical of his role as librettist. Olleson observes that in the three successive oratorio libretti that Van Swieten prepared for Haydn, his own involvement in the writing was greater for each than in the previous one. According to Olleson, &quot;many critics would say that this progressive originality was disastrous&quot;.

Even Van Swieten&#x27;s musical taste has been harshly criticized, but here the consensus is perhaps more positive. Van Swieten seems to have singled out for his favor—from among many composers whose reputation is now obscure—the composers that posterity has judged very highly. As Olleson notes, &quot;One could scarcely quarrel with his choice of composers of the past, Sebastian Bach and Handel; and of those of his own time, Gluck, Emanuel Bach, Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.&quot;

==In popular culture==

Unlike his protégés Mozart and Beethoven, Van Swieten is seldom portrayed in works of modern popular culture. He does appear as a supporting character in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s 1979 play &quot;Amadeus&quot; and in Miloš Forman&#x27;s 1984 film based on it.

<text>In theoretical computer science, more precisely in the theory of formal languages, the star height is a measure for the structural complexity 
of regular expressions and regular languages. The star height of a regular &quot;expression&quot; equals the maximum nesting depth of stars appearing in that expression. The star height of a regular &quot;language&quot; is the least star height of any regular expression for that language.
The concept of star height was first defined and studied by Eggan (1963).

==Formal definition==
More formally, the star height of a regular expression
&quot;E&quot; over a finite alphabet &quot;A&quot; is inductively defined as follows:

* formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3 for all alphabet symbols &quot;a&quot; in &quot;A&quot;.
* formula_4 
* formula_5

Here, formula_6 is the special regular expression denoting the empty set and ε the special one denoting the empty word; 
&quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; are arbitrary regular expressions.

The star height &quot;h&quot;(&quot;L&quot;) of a regular language &quot;L&quot; is defined as the minimum star height among all regular expressions representing &quot;L&quot;.
The intuition is here that if the language &quot;L&quot; has large star height, then it is in some sense inherently complex, since it cannot be described 
by means of an &quot;easy&quot; regular expression, of low star height.

==Examples==
While computing the star height of a regular expression is easy, determining the star height of a language can be sometimes tricky.
For illustration, the regular expression 

:formula_7 
over the alphabet &quot;A = {a,b}&quot;
has star height 2. However, the described language is just the set of all words ending in an &quot;a&quot;: thus the language can also be described by the expression 

:formula_8
which is only of star height 1. To prove that this language indeed has star height 1, one still needs to rule out that it could be described by a regular
expression of lower star height. For our example, this can be done by an indirect proof: One proves that a language of star height 0
contains only finitely many words. Since the language under consideration is infinite, it cannot be of star height 0.

The star height of a group language is computable: for example, the star height of the language over {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;} in which the number of occurrences of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are congruent modulo 2&quot;n&quot; is &quot;n&quot;.

==Eggan&#x27;s theorem==

In his seminal study of the star height of regular languages, established a relation between the theories of regular expressions, finite automata, and of directed graphs. In subsequent years, this relation became known as &quot;Eggan&#x27;s theorem&quot;, cf. . We recall a few concepts from graph theory and automata theory.
In graph theory, the cycle rank &quot;r&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of a directed graph (digraph) is inductively defined as follows:
* If &quot;G&quot; is acyclic, then . This applies in particular if &quot;G&quot; is empty.
* If &quot;G&quot; is strongly connected and &quot;E&quot; is nonempty, then
::formula_9where is the digraph resulting from deletion of vertex and all edges beginning or ending at .
* If &quot;G&quot; is not strongly connected, then &quot;r&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is equal to the maximum cycle rank among all strongly connected components of &quot;G&quot;.

In automata theory, a nondeterministic finite automaton with ε-transitions (ε-NFA) is defined as a 5-tuple, (&quot;Q&quot;, Σ, &quot;δ&quot;, &quot;q0&quot;, &quot;F&quot;), consisting of
* a finite set of states &quot;Q&quot;
* a finite set of input symbols Σ 
* a set of labeled edges &quot;δ&quot;, referred to as &quot;transition relation&quot;: &quot;Q&quot; × (Σ ∪{ε}) × &quot;Q&quot;. Here ε denotes the empty word.
* an &quot;initial&quot; state &quot;q&quot;0 ∈ &quot;Q&quot;
* a set of states &quot;F&quot; distinguished as &quot;accepting states&quot; &quot;F&quot; ⊆ &quot;Q&quot;.
A word &quot;w&quot; ∈ Σ* is accepted by the ε-NFA if there exists a directed path from the initial state &quot;q&quot;0 to some final state in &quot;F&quot; using edges from &quot;δ&quot;, such that the concatenation of all labels visited along the path yields the word &quot;w&quot;. The set of all words over Σ* accepted by the automaton is the &quot;language&quot; accepted by the automaton &quot;A&quot;.

When speaking of digraph properties of a nondeterministic finite automaton &quot;A&quot; with state set &quot;Q&quot;, we naturally address the digraph with vertex set &quot;Q&quot; induced by its transition relation. Now the theorem is stated as follows.
:Eggan&#x27;s Theorem: The star height of a regular language &quot;L&quot; equals the minimum cycle rank among all nondeterministic finite automata with ε-transitions accepting &quot;L&quot;.

Proofs of this theorem are given by , and more recently by .

==Generalized star height==
The above definition assumes that regular expressions are built from the elements of the alphabet &quot;A&quot;
using only the standard operators set union, concatenation, and Kleene star. &quot;Generalized regular expressions&quot; are defined just as regular expressions, but here also the set complement operator is allowed 
(the complement is always taken with respect to the set of all words over A). If we alter the definition such that taking complements does not increase the star height, that is,

:formula_10

we can define the generalized star height of a regular language &quot;L&quot; as the minimum star height among all &quot;generalized&quot; regular expressions 
representing &quot;L&quot;. It is an open problem whether some languages can only be expressed with a generalized star height greater than one: this is the generalized star-height problem.

Note that, whereas it is immediate that a language of (ordinary) star height 0 can contain only finitely many words, there exist infinite 
languages having generalized star height 0. For instance, the regular expression 
:formula_11 
which we saw in the example above, can be equivalently described by the generalized regular expression
:formula_12, 
since the complement of the empty set is precisely the set of all words over &quot;A&quot;. Thus the set of all words over the alphabet &quot;A&quot; ending in the letter &quot;a&quot; has star height one, while its 
generalized star height equals zero.

Languages of generalized star height zero are also called star-free languages. It can be shown that a language &quot;L&quot; is star-free if and only if its syntactic monoid is aperiodic ().

<text>In mathematics, an aperiodic semigroup is a semigroup &quot;S&quot; such that every element is aperiodic, that is, for each &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot; there exists a positive integer &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;xn&quot; = &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1. An aperiodic monoid is an aperiodic semigroup which is a monoid.

== Finite aperiodic semigroups ==
A finite semigroup is aperiodic if and only if it contains no nontrivial subgroups, so a synonym used (only?) in such contexts is group-free semigroup. In terms of Green&#x27;s relations, a finite semigroup is aperiodic if and only if its &quot;H&quot;-relation is trivial. These two characterizations extend to group-bound semigroups.

A celebrated result of algebraic automata theory due to Marcel-Paul Schützenberger asserts that a language is star-free if and only if its syntactic monoid is finite and aperiodic.

A consequence of the Krohn–Rhodes theorem is that every finite aperiodic monoid divides a wreath product of copies of the three-element flip-flop monoid, consisting of an identity element and two right zeros. The two-sided Krohn–Rhodes theorem alternatively characterizes finite aperiodic monoids as divisors of iterated block products of copies of the two-element semilattice.

<text>Fitzgerald Marine Reserve is a marine reserve in California on the Pacific Ocean, located just north of Pillar Point Harbor and Mavericks in the San Mateo County community of Moss Beach. Moss Beach is located approximately south of San Francisco and north of Santa Cruz. The reserve is a holding which extends from Montara light station at the north to Pillar Point on the south. The reserve consists of a three-mile stretch of beach, tidepool habitat, marsh, erosive bluffs, clifftop trail and cypress and eucalyptus forests. The property is owned by the State of California and managed by San Mateo County as a county park and nature preserve. The reserve is administratively assigned to be part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Adjacent to and possibly within the reserve is an endangered species of butterfly, the San Bruno elfin butterfly.

Montara State Marine Reserve &amp; Pillar Point State Marine Conservation Area extend offshore from Montara, just north of Pillar Point. Like underwater parks, these marine protected areas help conserve ocean wildlife and marine ecosystems. Fitzgerald Marine Reserve lies within Montara State Marine Reserve.

==History==
The site of the current Fitzgerald Marine Reserve was originally settled by Native Americans approximately 5,800 years ago. In 1908, the Ocean Shore Railroad extended through the town of Moss Beach, effectively creating this location as a tourist destination. Remains of the foundation and some original landscape features from the Smith-Doelger homesite from the early-1900s may be found on the bluffs overlooking the Reserve.

The site has long been a source of research and materials for marine biologists and collectors, so much so that, in 1969, San Mateo County urged the State of California to designate the site as a state reserve to protect the remaining flora and fauna. On August 5, 1969, the site was officially designated as a state reserve and was named after James V. Fitzgerald, former mayor of San Bruno and a longtime member of the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors.

==Natural features==

The tidepool habitat has long been prized as one of the best such habitats in northern California. It has been identified by the State of California as one of 34 such coastal habitats having &quot;Special Biological Significance&quot;. Sea urchins, anemone, hermit crabs and many other intertidal species are prominent.

At the north of the reserve San Vicente Creek empties into the Pacific Ocean and has a diverse habitat supporting Red Willow and other riparian species. From a footbridge across San Vicente Creek, one climbs atop the bluff trail, which rises about above the beach. From there one has rewarding views down upon Frenchmans Reef, a rich marine ecological area. Seaward the reserve extends to a depth of over downward into the Pacific Ocean. The reef is composed of the rock granodiorite.

An occurrence of the rare plant Hickman&#x27;s potentilla, &quot;Potentilla hickmanii&quot;, was observed by E.C. Suttliffe in 1933 in the vicinity of the mouth of San Vicente Creek within Moss Beach. This colony was not further documented for decades, but another colony was discovered toward the end of the 20th century north of Moss Beach. The plant was listed as an endangered species by the United States government in 1998, and had previously been listed as California endangered in 1973.

Sightings of the San Bruno elfin butterfly have been made adjacent to the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve in Montara. This endangered species has very limited range and habitat.

The active Seal Cove Fault (first mapped and named by William Glen in a 1959 publication of the University of California series in the geological sciences) forms much of the eastern boundary of the site. Glen first suggested that the Seal Cove fault was a northward extension of the San Gregorio fault. Submarine surveys later found that the fault extends northward under the Pacific Ocean and presumably joins the San Andreas Fault near Bolinas. The fault&#x27;s trace was formerly clearly exposed in a sea cliff at the northern portion of the reserve, but is now obscured by cultural changes.

==Details of habitats==
The coastal strand habitat lies between the Pacific Ocean and the upper edge of the beach or coastal marsh. Species enjoying this niche are the California sea lion, harbor seal, Snowy egret, Great blue heron, cormorant and a variety of terns, murres, gulls and other shorebirds. Within the tidepool area there are also sea urchins, anemone, hermit crabs and numerous other mollusks.

The flanks of San Vicente Creek and another unnamed drainage further south in the preserve are coastal salt marsh habitat. This niche is an important nesting and feeding area for many bird species including rails. Since this marsh lacks cordgrass, it is a poor nesting site of ducks. Dense pickleweed provides good habitat for a variety of rodents, reptiles and rabbits.

North of the salt marsh of Vicente Creek lies the freshwater marsh and seepage, which hosts a number of trees supporting bird-life and mammals. The arroyo willow here is important to migrating warblers and other passerines.

==Nearby features of interest==
At the southern edge of the reserve lies the Moss Beach Distillery, a California Point of Historical Interest, that has served as a clifftop restaurant since 1927. To the east of the reserve is the Seal Cove Inn, a luxury destination country inn operated by noted travel author Karen Brown.

The opening sequence of the movie &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; was filmed on the bluffs overlooking the Reserve.

<text>Donald Lee Haskins (March 14, 1930 – September 7, 2008), nicknamed &quot;The Bear&quot;, was an American basketball player and coach. He played college basketball for three years under coach Henry Iba at Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State University). He was the head coach at the University of Texas at El Paso from 1961 to 1999 (the school was known as Texas Western College until 1967). In 1966 his team won the NCAA tournament over the Wildcats of the University of Kentucky, coached by Adolph Rupp. The watershed game highlighted the end of racial segregation in college basketball.

In his time at Texas Western/UTEP, he compiled a 719–353 record, suffering only five losing seasons. His Miners won 14 Western Athletic Conference championships and four WAC tournament titles, had fourteen NCAA tournament berths and made seven trips to the NIT. Haskins led UTEP to 17 20-plus-win seasons and served as an assistant Olympic team coach in 1972. He was admitted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997 as a basketball coach. His 1966 team was inducted in its entirety by the same Hall of Fame on September 7, 2007. A movie was made about him called Glory Road in 2008.

==Early coaching career==
After college and a stint with the Amateur Athletic Union&#x27;s Artesia Travelers, Haskins began coaching small-town Texas high schools (Benjamin, Hedley and Dumas) from 1955 to 1961. He took a pay cut for a chance to be a college coach, accepting a job offer at Texas Western College—now known as the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) in 1961.

In the 1950s, prior to Haskins&#x27; arrival, Texas Western recruited and played African American players in a time when it was still common to find all-white college sports teams, particularly in the South. When Haskins arrived in El Paso, he inherited three black players from his coaching predecessor. One of those players, El Paso native Nolan Richardson, later won the 1994 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament national championship as the head coach at Arkansas.

In 1961–62, Haskins&#x27; first season as head coach, the Miners had an 18–6 record. The next year they posted a 19–7 mark and made the first of 14 NCAA tournament appearances under Haskins. They again reached the NCAA Tournament in 1964 and played in the NIT in 1965. On numerous occasions, Haskins stated that he believed his 1964 team could have won the NCAA Tournament had All-American Jim Barnes not fouled out after playing only eight minutes in a 64–60 loss to Kansas State in the tournament.

==1966 NCAA Championship team==
The Texas Western Miners finished the 1965–66 regular season with a 23–1 record, entering the NCAA Tournament ranked third in the nation in the final regular season AP college basketball poll.

In the first round of the tournament, the Miners defeated Oklahoma City 89–74. In the next round, they defeated Cincinnati 78–76 in overtime. They went on to defeat Kansas in double overtime in the Midwest Regional Finals, 81–80, and to defeat Utah in the national semifinals, 85–78.

Facing the top-ranked University of Kentucky in the championship game, Haskins made history by starting five African American players for the first time in a championship game against Kentucky&#x27;s all-white squad, coached by Adolph Rupp. The Miners took the lead midway in the first half and never relinquished it — though Kentucky closed to within a point early in the second half. The Miners finished with 72 points to Kentucky&#x27;s 65, winning the tournament and finishing the year with a 28–1 record.

Later asked about his decision to start five African American players, Haskins downplayed the significance of his decision. &quot;I really didn&#x27;t think about starting five black guys. I just wanted to put my five best guys on the court,&quot; Haskins was later quoted as saying. &quot;I just wanted to win that game.&quot;

Though credited with advancing the desegregation of college basketball teams in the South, he wrote in his book, &quot;Glory Road&quot;, &quot;I certainly did not expect to be some racial pioneer or to change the world.&quot;

==Post-championship career==
Haskins was never able to duplicate his 1966 success. After winning the 1966 title, his Miners would only win seven more NCAA Tournament games and only survived the tournament&#x27;s first weekend twice, in 1967 and 1992.

Nonetheless, he is regarded as an important figure in basketball history. Among the players he coached at UTEP over the years were future NBA all-stars Nate Archibald, Tim Hardaway, and Antonio Davis. Other UTEP alums moving to the NBA included Marlon Maxey and Greg Foster. He was also a mentor for several future coaches, including Nolan Richardson and Tim Floyd. He served as an assistant coach under Hank Iba in the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.

A street is named after him in El Paso&#x27;s East side. In 1977, UTEP moved from Memorial Gym, home of the 1966 champions, to the larger Special Events Center. In 1998, before what would be Haskins&#x27; last season, it was renamed the Don Haskins Center in his honor.

Bob Knight was Haskins&#x27; fishing partner and one of his best friends. Another good friend, Norm Ellenberger, was former coach of the New Mexico Lobos.

In 1997, he was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports hall of Fame.

==&quot;Glory Road&quot;==

&quot;Glory Road&quot;, a Walt Disney Pictures film about the then-Texas Western 1966 championship season, was released on January 13, 2006. Haskins is portrayed in the film by actor Josh Lucas. On November 29, 2005, the City of El Paso renamed the street between its two basketball arenas &quot;Glory Road.&quot; Adolph Rupp Jr. pointed out that his father had previously used the term &quot;Glory Road&quot; in his farewell speech to his fans and worried that his father would be villainized in the film. However, director Jim Gartner stated that Rupp Sr. would not be negatively portrayed in the film, claiming that Jon Voight, who played Rupp, was careful in his role, seeking not to mischaracterize Rupp as a racist.

Haskins stated his disappointment at the cutting of the movie scenes of his one-on-one games with his boyhood friend Herman Carr, who is African-American. Carr was present in El Paso as a guest for the premiere screening, November 28, 2005. These scenes would have depicted a formative influence on Haskins&#x27; game of basketball. Haskins appeared in the movie as an extra by playing a gas station attendant.

&quot;Glory Road&quot; was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and was based upon Haskins&#x27; official same-titled autobiography, written with Dan Wetzel and released by Hyperion Books in 2005. A national best seller, it was reprinted five times in its first four months of release and was selected as an &quot;Editor&#x27;s Choice&quot; by the New York Times Book Review.

==Death==
Haskins died at his home on September 7, 2008. He was survived by his wife Mary, sons Brent, Steve, and David, and grandsons John Paul, Cameron, and Dominick. A fourth son, Mark, died in 1994. His son Steve is a professional golfer who began play on the Champions Tour after reaching the age of 50 and won two events on the Nationwide Tour during his regular career years. Haskins is buried at the Memory Gardens of the Valley in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

<text>The Salem River is a tributary of the Delaware River in southwestern New Jersey in the United States.

The course and watershed of the Salem River are entirely within Salem County. Tributaries of the Salem include Game Creek, Mannington Creek, and Fenwick Creek. The river rises in Upper Pittsgrove Township and flows initially westwardly, through Pilesgrove Township and the borough of Woodstown and along the boundaries of Carneys Point and Mannington Townships. Near Deepwater it approaches to within of the Delaware River, a distance breached by the Salem (Deepwater) Canal, which connects the two rivers. From there the Salem River turns to the south, flowing along the boundary of Mannington and Pennsville Townships, where it widens into a meandering shallow estuary, Kates Creek Meadow, and passes the city of Salem, its head of navigability. It flows into the Delaware River from the east near the head of Delaware Bay, on the boundary of Pennsville and Elsinboro townships, approximately west of Salem and approximately southeast of Finns Point.

The Delaware and the Salem are tidal. The Delaware River Main Channel is maintained at a depth of and expected to be in 2017 Reach D, which includes the entrance to Port of Salem, was completed in 2010. The shipping channel of the Salem River is much shallower, making the city a low draft port, which prohibits use by Handymax class ships. The river is entered though Salem Cove about from the entrance of the Delaware Bay. The channel travels along the southeast side of the cove for and continues another upstream of the first vehicular bridge crossing it.
The Salem River and Cut-Off was first channelized in 1925 to a depth of .

According to the Geographic Names Information System, the river has also been known historically as &quot;Firkins Creek&quot;, &quot;Varkens Kill&quot;, and &quot;Varkins Kill&quot; (Hogg Creek). The Board on Geographic Names settled on &quot;Salem River&quot; as the stream&#x27;s name in 1940. The estuary was inhabited by Lenape at the time of European colonization. In 1641, emigrants from the New Haven Colony settled along the Varkens Kill. Fort Elfsborg, a settlement of the New Sweden colony was constructed along the eastern bank of the Delaware near the mouth of the Salem in 1642–1643. The fort was later abandoned because of the prevalence of mosquitoes and the construction of Fort Casimir by the New Netherland Dutch across the river. In 1675, the village of Salem was founded near the mouth of the Salem river as part of the Fenwick Colony.

<text>In the fields of sociology and social psychology, a breaching experiment is an experiment that seeks to examine people&#x27;s reactions to violations of commonly accepted social rules or norms. Breaching experiments are most commonly associated with ethnomethodology, and in particular the work of Harold Garfinkel. Breaching experiments involve the conscious exhibition of &quot;unexpected&quot; behavior/violation of social norms, an observation of the types of social reactions such behavioral violations engender, and an analysis of the social structure that makes these social reactions possible. The idea of studying the violation of social norms and the accompanying reactions has bridged across social science disciplines, and is today used in both sociology and psychology.

The assumption behind this approach is not only that individuals engage daily in building up &quot;rules&quot; for social interaction, but also that people are unaware they are doing so. The work of sociologist Erving Goffman laid the theoretical foundation for ways to study the construction of everyday social meanings and behavioral norms, especially by breaking unstated but universally accepted rules. Garfinkel expanded on this idea by developing ethnomethodology as a qualitative research method for social scientists. Later, in the 1970s and 80s, famous social psychologist Stanley Milgram developed two experiments to observe and quantify responses to breaches in social norms to empirically analyze reactions to violation of those norms.

== Erving Goffman on social interaction ==
Goffman published two seminal works related to this domain: &quot;Behavior in Public Places&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Relations in Public: Microstudies of the Public Order,&quot; published in 1971. Goffman draws on his earlier studies of individuals in mental asylums, as well as other stigmatized social groups, in order to highlight the often taken-for-granted rules of social interaction, as well as the results when rules are broken. He argues that the most common rule in all social situations is for the individual to &quot;fit in&quot;. He defines norms as a kind of guide for action supported by social sanctions or reactions, in that there are penalties for infraction, or breaking norms, while individuals are generally rewarded for compliance. If an individual breaches a social norm, the act is often attributed to some property of the individual, such as that the person is sick or mentally ill. For example, a person who is observed talking to himself in a public place is assumed to be mentally ill by any strangers who may notice.

Goffman further states that social gatherings have significant importance for organizing social life. He argues that all people in a social setting have some concern regarding the rules governing behavior. Infractions, or violation of an unstated rule, may be &quot;taken as a sign that the offender cannot be trusted&quot; not to take advantage of the situation &quot;even though the original infraction itself&quot; may actually be harmless. Individuals come to &quot;feel that rules for participating in gatherings are crucial for society’s well-being&quot; and that these &quot;rules are natural, inviolable, and fundamentally right&quot;.

== Harold Garfinkel and &quot;making commonplace scenes visible&quot; ==
Garfinkel suggests that each member of society uses &quot;background expectancies&quot; to interpret and decide how to act in a social situation. However, individuals are unable to explicitly describe what each of these expectancies, or rules, are. One way to help make background expectancies more visible is to be a &quot;stranger to the life as usual character of everyday scenes&quot;. For instance, saying &quot;hello&quot; at the termination of a conversation. Although the term &quot;breaching experiment&quot; developed as a result of Garfinkel&#x27;s approach, he warns it should not properly be called an experiment, but more accurately, a demonstration meant to produce disorganized interaction in order to highlight how the structures of everyday activities are ordinarily created and maintained.

Some examples of everyday scenes include the home, school, or workplace. One task Garfinkel assigned to his graduate students was to challenge everyday understandings by frequently asking for clarification during a normal conversation with a friend or family member. Below is an example of an excerpt quoted in Garfinkel&#x27;s text, Case 2 of &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot;:

This is a breaching experiment in the form of interpersonal conversation. The violation of the expectancy of shared verbal understanding between friends results in the subject expressing confusion and irritation. Garfinkel conducted other experiments—often using his students:

* Students were to return to their parental homes and observe their family as if each student was a . Many students found this difficult as their distanced assessments of their family were discordant with their everyday beliefs (e.g., how often people argued). They were happy to return to what one student described as the &quot;real me&quot;.
* Students were to do the same as above, but actually behave as if they were lodgers. The associated distance and politeness resulted in reports of &quot;astonishment, bewilderment, shock, anxiety, embarrassment, and anger, and with charges by various family members that the student was mean, inconsiderate, selfish, nasty, or impolite&quot;.
* Students were to engage in conversation with others with the assumption that what the other person said was directed by hidden motives. Family members and friends were reported as having hurt feelings, and the two students who tried this with strangers were unable to complete the interaction.
* Students were to participate in an evaluation in which their assessments of others was contradicted by subsequent information revealed by other assessors. Subsequently, many students tried to reconcile their initial opinion with the information and assessment provided by others.
* They were asked to bargain for standard-priced merchandise in a store. Students felt anxiety in anticipation of the task and approaching the salesperson. However, this lessened once they began their interactions and were surprised by the possibility of succeeding.
* Subjects played tic-tac-toe where the experimenter asked the subject to make the first move, then erases that mark and moves it to another square before making the responding move. Subjects were confused by this and interpreted the action as a sexual pass, a comment on their own stupidity, or as the impudence of the experimenter. Eventually, most demanded a reckoning of this behavior.
* Subjects were asked to stand very, very close to a person while engaging in otherwise innocuous conversation.

Garfinkel instructed his students to treat such everyday, implicit understandings as problematic phenomena to be studied. Breaching experiments reveal the resilience of social reality, since the subjects respond immediately to normalize the breach. They do so by rendering the situation understandable in familiar terms. It is assumed that the way people handle these breaches reveals much about how they handle their everyday lives.

==Social psychology approach to breaching norms==
Later work in the field of social psychology adapted this approach, but often refers to the phenomena as social norm breaking. Two of the most well known studies of violation of social norms by a social psychologist were carried out by Stanley Milgram, well known for his infamous obedience experiments. One was conducted on the New York City Subway in the 1970s, when experimenters boarded crowded trains and asked able-bodied but seated riders, with no explanation, to give up their seats. The other was conducted in the 1980s, and studied the reactions to graduate student experimenters cutting ahead in lines of people waiting to purchase railroad tickets. These experiments build on the sociological work on breaching norms, but note that they are approached quantitatively by being structured so the experimenter can observe and count people&#x27;s reactions.

===&quot;On maintaining social norms: a field experiment in the subway&quot;===

Milgram defines &quot;residual rules&quot; as rules that fulfill two criteria: 
# People must substantially agree on them.
# People don&#x27;t notice them until a violation occurs.

A residual rule of everyday interaction on the New York City Subway is that seats are on a first-come, first-served basis and individuals are not supposed to talk to one another in such close quarters.

The experimenters violated this implicit rule by asking people to give up their seats. They then measured the responses as the number of times individuals consented or refused to give up their seats, and also noted people&#x27;s verbal and physical reactions to the request. Experimenters approached individuals under three conditions:

# The experimenter approached the subject and said, &quot;Excuse me. May I please have your seat?&quot; No justification was offered.
# The second condition tested the hypothesis that subjects gave up their seats because they assumed the experimenter had some important reason for requesting it. To rule out this assumption, experimenters were instructed to ask &quot;Excuse me. May I please have your seat? I can&#x27;t read my book standing up.&quot;
# The third condition was included because the experimenters believed that subjects might have been so startled by the request that they didn&#x27;t have time to think about an adequate reply. Therefore, in this condition, to alert the subject that a seat might be requested, two experimenters entered the subway car from different doors: one would say &quot;Excuse me. Do you think it would be all right if I asked someone for a seat?&quot; and the other &quot;I don&#x27;t know.&quot;
The experimenters reasoned that subjects in the no justification condition engaged in normalization of the breach by attributing a meaning to the violation that would make it seem not to be a violation at all. An example of such a normalization would be &quot;he is asking for a seat because he is sick.&quot; Since the second condition, the trivial justification, prevented the process of normalization, subjects could not as easily imagine an appropriate justification for the request, and therefore, a much lower number gave up their seats. In the third, overheard condition, the experimenters reasoned that the warning of the pending seat request allowed subjects to be better prepared to refuse the request.

An important aspect of the maintenance of social norms is also revealed in the emotional reactions felt by the experimenters. Most of the experimenters reported great difficulty in carrying out the task. They reported that, when standing in front of the subject, they felt anxious, tense, and embarrassed. Many felt unable to verbalize the request for a seat and had to withdraw. They sometimes feared they were the center of attention in the car and were often unable to look directly at the subjects. Once they made a successful request for a seat, they felt pressure to act in a way that would actually justify the request, such as pretending to be ill. Milgram proposes that the experimenters were playing the social role of subway rider, and they felt an extreme emotional reaction as a result of breaking implicit rules for that role. These extreme emotional reactions reflect how important it is to people to engage in routine, everyday activities.

===&quot;Response to intrusion into waiting lines&quot;===

Another norm breaching study led by Milgram sought to examine the response of people waiting in line to intruders, again violating &quot;first-come, first served&quot;. This was done by having experimenters break into naturally formed lines around New York City and noting how people respond to them. The experimenters encroached on a total of 129 waiting lines, formed at railroad ticket counters, betting parlors, and other New York City locations.

The lines had an average of six people waiting. The experimenter calmly approached a point between a 3rd and 4th person in line and said in a neutral tone &quot;Excuse me, I’d like to get in here.” Before anyone in the line could respond, the intruder cut in line and faced forward. If the experimental intruder was directly admonished to leave the line, he or she did so. Otherwise, the intruder stayed in the line for one minute before departing. Three female and two male graduate students acted as intruders, with an observer watching nearby to record physical, verbal, and nonverbal reactions to the intrusion. The experiment manipulated conditions by having either one or two intruders break into the line, as well as varying one or two buffers, or experimenters standing passively by in the line. This enabled the researchers to test whether the responsibility of addressing the intruder would extend from the person closest behind in line to the rest of those in line.



Broadly, results indicated that others in line objected most frequently when there were more intruders and fewer buffers. Nonverbal objections included dirty looks, hostile stares, and gestures. Verbal interjections included &quot;No way! The line&#x27;s back there. We&#x27;ve all been waiting and have trains to catch&quot;.

As reported in Milgram&#x27;s subway study, experimenters in this study also experienced a high level of negative emotion associated with the task of intrusion into lines. Experimenters described feeling nauseated, anxious, and struggling to get up the &quot;nerve&quot; to intrude in a line. Milgram reasons that these feelings make up the &quot;inhibitory anxiety that ordinarily prevents individuals from breaching social norms&quot; and indicate that the internal restraints against intruding into lines play a significant role in assuring the integrity of the line.

== Other examples ==
Social science researcher Earl R. Babbie instructed his students to experiment fixing problems for which they had no prior responsibility, such as picking up garbage from the street or mending street signs. Their self-consciousness while doing this, and the negative reactions they encountered, showed that &quot;in the normal course of things, it is simply not acceptable for people to take responsibility for public things&quot;. Babbie claims that people have negative reactions when they see somebody fixing something that is not his/her &quot;job&quot; to fix; in some cases, altruistic actions are viewed as personal intrusions. However, he noted that these negative reactions were often based on incorrect assumptions, and when those assumptions were corrected the bystanders stopped reacting negatively. For instance, when a student picked up trash bystanders assumed that the student was responsible for the mess and either felt guilty or was being forced to clean it up. When the truth was explained, bystanders often joined in and assisted the students.

<text>Joint Force Harrier, initially known as Joint Force 2000 and towards the end of its life as Joint Strike Wing, was the British military formation which controlled the British Aerospace Harrier II and British Aerospace Sea Harrier aircraft of the Royal Air Force and Fleet Air Arm between 2000 and 2011. It was subordinate to RAF Air Command.

Upon its disbandment there were two operational Joint Strike Wing squadrons, one Fleet Air Arm and one Royal Air Force, plus an RAF Operational Conversion Unit.

==History==
Joint Force Harrier (JFH) was established on 1 April 2000 in response to the proposal brought by the British Government as part of Strategic Defence Review. Originally called Joint Force 2000, it combined the Royal Navy&#x27;s two Sea Harrier FA2 squadrons with the RAF&#x27;s four Harrier GR7/7A squadrons under a single command structure within RAF Strike Command. This force was to be deployable from both s, Royal Air Force stations and deployed air bases.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s contribution to the force was the Sea Harrier previously part of Naval Air Command.

In 2006, No. 3 Squadron RAF converted to the Eurofighter Typhoon. In the same year, the Sea Harrier was retired and 800 Naval Air Squadron re-equipped with former 3 Squadron Harrier GR7 and GR9 aircraft. At the same time, the size of operational squadrons reduced from 12 aircraft to nine. The Naval Air Squadron operated but did not own the aircraft.

801 Naval Air Squadron was also intended to reform with Harrier GR7/9s in 2007. However, on 9 March 2007, the Naval Strike Wing (NSW) was formed. This saw elements of both Fleet Air Arm squadrons amalgamate into a single operational squadron for deployment either on land (such as Afghanistan) or aboard the Royal Navy&#x27;s two aircraft carriers ( and ). On 1 April 2010, NSW reverted to the identity of 800 Naval Air Squadron.

On 31 March 2010, the force was reduced by one squadron with the disbandment of No. 20 Squadron RAF, the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit (OCU). No. 4 Squadron also disbanded and reformed as No. 4 (Reserve) Squadron at RAF Wittering, taking over as the OCU. At the same time, Joint Force Harrier was renamed Joint Strike Wing and all remaining Harrier GR7 aircraft were retired. Until 2010, it was intended that the Harrier GR9 fleet would continue in service until replaced by 138 STOVL-capable F-35B Lightning II aircraft around 2018. However, on 19 October 2010, as part of the UK government&#x27;s Strategic Defence and Security Review, it was announced that the Harrier out-of-service date was to be brought forward to April 2011.

HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the last of the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class carriers, launched her final fixed wing aircraft on 24 November 2010 when the four embarked Harrier GR9s left the ship to return to land. On 15 December 2010, a 16 aircraft flypast from RAF Cottesmore marked the final operational flights of British Harriers. 1(F) Squadron, 4(R) Squadron and 800 NAS were disbanded on 28 January 2011.

<doc id="670026" wikidata="Q3321297" url="?curid=670026" title="Syntactic monoid">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, the syntactic monoid formula_1 of a formal language formula_2 is the smallest monoid that recognizes the language formula_2.

==Syntactic quotient==
The free monoid on a given set is the monoid whose elements are all the strings of zero or more elements from that set, with string concatenation as the monoid operation and the empty string as the identity element. Given a subset formula_4 of a free monoid formula_5, one may define sets that consist of formal left or right inverses of elements in formula_4. These are called quotients, and one may define right or left quotients, depending on which side one is concatenating. Thus, the right quotient of formula_4 by an element formula_8 from formula_5 is the set
:formula_10

Similarly, the left quotient is

:formula_11

==Syntactic equivalence==
The syntactic quotient induces an equivalence relation on formula_5, called the syntactic relation, or syntactic equivalence (induced by formula_4).

The &quot;right syntactic equivalence&quot; is the equivalence relation

:formula_14.

Similarly, the &quot;left syntactic equivalence&quot; is

:formula_15.

Observe that the &quot;right&quot; syntactic equivalence is a &quot;left&quot; congruence with respect to string concatenation and vice versa; i.e., formula_16 for all formula_17.

The syntactic congruence or Myhill congruence is defined as

:formula_18.

The definition extends to a congruence defined by a subset formula_4 of a general monoid formula_5. A disjunctive set is a subset formula_4 such that the syntactic congruence defined by formula_4 is the equality relation.

Let us call formula_23 the equivalence class of formula_24 for the syntactic congruence.
The syntactic congruence is compatible with concatenation in the monoid, in that one has

:formula_25

for all formula_26. Thus, the syntactic quotient is a monoid morphism, and induces a quotient monoid

:formula_27.

This monoid formula_28 is called the syntactic monoid of formula_4.
It can be shown that it is the smallest monoid that recognizes formula_4; that is, formula_28 recognizes formula_4, and for every monoid formula_33 recognizing formula_4, formula_28 is a quotient of a submonoid of formula_33. The syntactic monoid of formula_4 is also the transition monoid of the minimal automaton of formula_4.

A group language is one for which the syntactic monoid is a group.

==Myhill–Nerode theorem==

The Myhill–Nerode theorem states: a language formula_2 is regular if and only if the family of quotients formula_40 is finite, or equivalently, the left syntactic equivalence formula_41 has &quot;finite index&quot; (meaning it partitions formula_5 into finitely many equivalence classes).

This theorem was first proved by Anil Nerode and the relation formula_41 is thus referred to as Nerode congruence by some authors.

===Proof===

The proof of the &quot;only if&quot; part is as follows. Assume that a finite automaton recognizing formula_2 reads input formula_45, which leads to state formula_46. If formula_47 is another string read by the machine, also terminating in the same state formula_46, then clearly one has formula_49. Thus, the number of elements in formula_50 is at most equal to the number of states of the automaton and formula_51 is at most the number of final states.

For a proof of the &quot;if&quot; part, assume that the number of elements in formula_50 is finite. One can then construct an automaton where formula_53 is the set of states, formula_54 is the set of final states, the language formula_2 is the initial state, and the transition function is given by formula_56. Clearly, this automaton recognizes formula_2. 

Thus, a language formula_2 is recognizable if and only if the set formula_50 is finite. Note that this proof also builds the minimal automaton.

==Examples==
* Let formula_2 be the language over formula_61 of words of even length. The syntactic congruence has two classes, formula_2 itself and formula_63, the words of odd length. The syntactic monoid is the group of order 2 on formula_64. 
* For the language formula_65, the minimal automaton has 4 states and the syntactic monoid has 15 elements.
* The bicyclic monoid is the syntactic monoid of the Dyck language (the language of balanced sets of parentheses).
* The free monoid on formula_66 (where formula_67) is the syntactic monoid of the language formula_68, where formula_69 is the reversal of the word formula_70. (For formula_71, one can use the language of square powers of the letter.)
* Every non-trivial finite monoid is homomorphic to the syntactic monoid of some non-trivial language, but not every finite monoid is isomorphic to a syntactic monoid.
* Every finite group is isomorphic to the syntactic monoid of some regular language.
* The language over formula_72 in which the number of occurrences of formula_73 and formula_74 are congruent modulo formula_75 is a group language with syntactic monoid formula_76.
* Trace monoids are examples of syntactic monoids.
* Marcel-Paul Schützenberger characterized star-free languages as those with finite aperiodic syntactic monoids.

<doc id="670042" wikidata="Q1747363" url="?curid=670042" title="Meriden, West Midlands">
<text>Meriden is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull, West Midlands, England. Historically, it is part of Warwickshire and lies between the cities of Birmingham and Coventry. It is located close to the North Warwickshire district border within a green belt of the countryside known as the Meriden Gap and is in the ecclesiastical parish of the Diocese of Coventry. 

The village is east-northeast of Solihull, west-northwest of Coventry and east-southeast of Birmingham city centre. It was known as &quot;Alspath&quot; in the Domesday Book. The village gives its name to the Meriden parliamentary constituency, which was created in 1955 and covers the Meriden Gap. In the 2011 Census, the population of the Meriden parish was 2,719. The population is estimated to have risen to 3,096 by 2017.

== History ==

The area has been occupied since the Stone Age, as evidenced by flints in the Blythe valley. Bronze Age swords have also been found in Meriden. In 43 AD, nearby Corley Rocks marked the southern limit of the cattle rearing Cornovii tribe.

The original name of the village was Alspath, meaning &quot;Aelle&#x27;s path&quot; in Old English. The village was centred on the site of the parish church, overlooking the current village, at the Coventry end of Meriden.

Alspath is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the property of Godiva, the former Countess of Mercia. For the few centuries after the conquest, the whole area was the Forest of Arden. The importance of the hilltop location of Alspath as the hub of the village declined as the &#x27;king&#x27;s highway&#x27; main route from London to Chester and Holyhead developed—in turn encouraging the development of Meriden. The name &#x27;Meriden&#x27; derives from the Old English &quot;myrge&quot;, pleasant, and &quot;denu&quot;, valley. Between the 15th and 17th centuries, the name &#x27;Meriden&#x27; gradually supplanted that of Alspath as the straggling settlement at the foot of the hill grew in importance.

In the late 11th century, the village was small and impoverished, with a population of only nine families (45 persons). The first mention of it as a separate hamlet was in 1230. By the time of Edward I (1272–1307) there was a thriving community &#x27;worth encouraging&#x27; in the eyes of the Lord of Alspath. By the reign of Henry VIII, the village was growing more substantial and stretched from the foot of Meriden Hill to where the &quot;Bull&#x27;s Head&quot; is now. Ogilivy&#x27;s &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Guide Book&quot; in 1675 describes Meriden as &quot;... A scattering village consisting chiefly of inns&quot;. By 1686 the population had grown to 290 people. By 1772 there were 93 cottages and houses. In 1811 the village had 152 homes, 171 families and 817 people.&quot;

Meriden was a local distribution point in the 16th-century cattle-driving trade, with the pool at the centre of the old village used to water the animals. Cattle would rest in Meriden before continuing either to the cattle pens at the top of Meriden Hill for the Coventry cattle market, or towards the cattle market then held in Berkswell.

The path of the London-Chester/Holyhead road gained strategic and commercial importance over time. The section which ran through Coventry to the bottom of Meriden Hill became a turnpike in 1723. Thomas Telford renovated the whole route to Holyhead in 1810, lowering Meriden Hill and thus bypassing the Queen&#x27;s Head Pub and the &#x27;Old Road&#x27;. This &#x27;Telford road&#x27; remained the main Coventry to Birmingham Road until 1958, when the village was bypassed by the A45 dual carriageway. The old, narrow road past the Queen&#x27;s Head is the site of the pre-Telford turnpike.

The shape of the current centre of the village, around the green, was another product of enclosure post-1785. Whilst the west end of the village had previously been the meeting place of lanes coming in to the main London-Chester road from Fillongley, Maxstoke and Packington; the ultimate shape was completed with another enclosure provision &quot;staking out a new road to Hampton-in-Arden across the Heath&quot;.

=== Manor and overlordship ===
Following the Norman Conquest, the overlordship of Alspath/Meriden passed successively through the hands of the Earls of Chester (1080), the Segrave family (1220), the Mowbray Earls of Norfolk (late 14th century), the Stanley Earls of Derby (1468/1501), and the Earls of Aylesford (1784).

Of the Lords of the Manor owing fealty to those overlords, two in particular who contributed to events in English history or to the parish church. Ivo of Alspath was the first Norman holder of the Knight&#x27;s fee that was Alspath/Meriden. He took his name from the village. Under the overlordship of the Earl of Chester, he built the core of the current church of St. Laurence (circa 1150) for reasons covered below. After his death the manor was split amongst his four daughters:
* A manor based on the original siting, around the church and occupied since 1481 by the building of Moat House farm.
* The manor of Alspath Hall, the remains of which are sited in a field off the access to the A45 from Showell Lane.
* A manor that became the property of Meriden Hall.
* The building and land known as Walsh Hall (formerly and alternately as Wyard&#x27;s Place).
* The fifth subdivision (Marbrook Hall) near Hollyberry End, near the junction of Shaft Lane and Becks Lane, is now considered a later claim.

The second was Gerard (or Gerald) II of Alspath (d. 1282). He was involved with the escape from the Tower of London of Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. His wife Millicent gave the name to what is now known as Millisons Wood, at the far east end of the village, at the top of Meriden Hill.

===In history===

Meriden has never itself been a significant location in English and British history. It is, however, located within a narrow band of castles with significant historical interest. to the north is Maxstoke Castle, one of the three seats of the Stafford Dukes of Buckingham in the mid-to-late 15th century and deemed to be a favourite residence of Lady Margaret Beaufort after her second marriage into the Stafford family. south is Kenilworth Castle, site of the longest siege in English history; and south is Warwick Castle, the seat of Warwick the Kingmaker, Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick.

The escape of the powerful Marcher lord, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, one of only two escapes from the Tower of London in its history, involves a critical Meriden connection. Constable Stephen Segrave and Deputy Constable of the Tower Gerard Alspath were Overlord and Lord of the Manor of Meriden/Alspath, respectively. Gerard was implicated in the escape; but Segrave escaped the initial reprisal, as described by the 14th-century chronicler Henry Knighton from St Mary de Pratis Abbey, Leicester, better known as Leicester Abbey: listing Stephen&#x27;s excuse being that he had been duped by a supposedly loyal servant in whom he had confidence, Gerard Alspath. Another person involved in the escape was a progenitor of John Wyard of what is now Walsh Hall, whose effigy resides in the parish church.

After the death in 1460 of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, the previous owner of Maxstoke Castle, at the Battle of Northampton, an inquisition was held in Alspath to determine the heirs and liabilities for his estates.

By the late 15th century the overlord of Alspath/Meriden was Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby.

Queen Elizabeth I stayed at the previous house on the site of Meriden Hall in 1575.

The last male Walsh owner of Walsh Hall, Sir Richard Walsh, was the Sheriff of Worcestershire who cornered the last group of Gunpowder Plot conspirators in 1605.

Shortly before the first battle of the English Civil War in 1642, south at Edgehill, the royal army camped on Meriden Heath whilst the King slept at nearby Packington Hall.

When Bonnie Prince Charlie marched south in the last of the great Jacobite rebellions in 1745, the government forces, recalled from the continent and assembled to oppose him, waited on Meriden Heath under the command of the Duke of Cumberland.

The novelist George Eliot visited her sister in Meriden repeatedly until 1854. Her sister is buried in the churchyard of St Laurence&#x27;s parish church.
In 1897, Jane (Jeannie) Monckton founded Meriden School, located in Strathfield, an inner-western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, which took the name &#x27;Meriden&#x27; from this town. It was named due to the happy memories that her husband had as a child holidaying in Meriden, and the hope that the school would be a similar place of happy childhood memories. Today, it is an independent Anglican single-sex day school for girls, with approximately 1600 students from early learning, through Year K to Year 12.

The grindcore band Napalm Death was formed in Meriden in 1981

== Traditional Centre of England ==

Meriden was identified as the centre of England as early as 1829. That designation was shown to be inaccurate in 1920, when the first systematic attempt was made to validate the claim.

A grade II listed sandstone monument on the village green carries a plaque commemorating Meriden&#x27;s status as Centre of England. Traditionally known as the sandstone cross, a photograph from 1879 shows a garland that would have originally enclosed a cross on top of the monument, like the one at Hockwold cum Wilton. The garland was lost between 1879 and 1885. The cross was originally located in the old centre of the village, where the road initially came in from Berkswell before the junction was straightened in 1785. The monument was moved to the village green in 1822. It was moved yet again to its current position on the green in 1952–1953.

Also on the village green is a memorial bench to Walter MacGregor &quot;Robbie&quot; Robinson (died 17 September 1956). He was also known as Wayfarer and had a major role in promoting cycle touring for the general public in the UK from the 1920s onwards through writing, giving lectures and as a cycling role model. The bench was installed by the Cyclists&#x27; Touring Club.

== St Laurence Parish Church ==

The parish church of St. Laurence was built on the site of a simple Saxon church, dedicated to St. Edmund, erected on her own land by Lady Godiva—the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia in the years prior to the Norman conquest.

The present church was built in several stages. The nave and two-thirds of the chancel were finished by the late 12th century—late Norman—and were probably built as an expiation for sins committed during the civil war between Stephen and Matilda by Ivo de Alspath. St Mary&#x27;s Priory, Coventry, and the Benedictine Priory at Monk&#x27;s Kirby near Rugby being two notable targets of his overlord, the Earl of Chester&#x27;s, raiding parties—the earl having remained aloof from taking sides and instead forming marauding bands to raid, pillage and to pocket crown taxes.

The chancel was extended in the 13th century, and the south aisle and the tower were added in the late 14th. The north aisle was added, and the Norman roof was replaced in the 15th century.

Around 1831, both aisles were demolished and rebuilt with galleries to provide more space for the congregation. It is possible see the industrial quality of the stonework outside the building compared to the 14th or 15th century stone used inside. A few gravestones have been used in the external stonework.

In 1883, the church was restored again, and those galleries were removed. At some point the 15th century wooden ceilings of both nave and chancel had been plastered over, and these were uncovered during a restoration in 1924. Finally, extensive restorations of the medieval roof and tower were carried out circa 2006–10.


The current siting of alabaster effigies in the church is of 20th-century origin. There are pictures of an earlier 19th century siting in the centre of the nave. To the right, where his chantry was located is John Wyard, a late 14th century man at arms (never knighted) who was part of the retinue for the then Beauchamp Earl of Warwick. The effigy to the left represents Sir Thomas Bottiler who died at the Battle of Northampton (at the same time as the 1st Duke of Buckingham.

On the left is a squint, an opening allowing penitents from a side chapel to witness the raising of the Host at the main altar.

The Saint Laurence/Lawrence (spelling interchangeable) to whom the church is dedicated may be either Lawrence of Rome who was one of the seven deacons of the early church martyred during the persecution of Emperor Valerian in 258 AD; or it may have been Laurence of Canterbury who became the second Archbishop of Canterbury in 604 AD. Legend favors the latter, although, from 1318 onward, the choice of 10 August for the Patronal feast day and the village fair (until 1959) would indicate the Roman Lawrence.

The Heart of England Way long-distance path, linking the Staffordshire Heathlands together with the Cotswolds and the Forest of Arden, passes through the churchyard.

Meriden is home to a memorial obelisk dedicated to the cyclists who died in the First World War. National cycling organisations commemorate these deaths with an annual mid-May service on the green. The grey granite memorial originally cost £1,100 and was unveiled on 21 May 1921 in the presence of over 20,000 cyclists.

The village&#x27;s own war memorial is at the Berkswell Road turn-off from the Meriden main road, opposite the pool. It takes the form of a wayside shrine with a crucified Jesus and is located on the land donated by Letitia Banks, heiress of Meriden Hall and wife of Captain Edward Banks. Edward Banks was the first WWI death from the village, due to friendly fire at the Battle of St Julien in 1915. He is commemorated in a stained glass window in the church.

== Triumph motorcycles ==

From 1941 until 1983, Meriden was associated with the large Triumph motorcycles production plant.
Its original Priory Street factory in Coventry was destroyed by the Luftwaffe during World War II.
As documented in the book &quot;Forty Summers Ago&quot;, the factory was visited by Steve McQueen and Bud Ekins with the rest of the 1964 U.S. International Six Day Trials team to collect their specially prepared Triumphs.
In 1973, Triumph workers blockaded the factory from the new owners, Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT), to prevent closure. The government loaned the subsequent Meriden Workers Co-Operative money to buy the factory and later to market the Triumph motorcycles they produced. The sit-in and formation of the co-operative were the subject of much media interest including David Edgar&#x27;s play, &quot;Events Following The Closure Of A Motorcycle Factory&quot;. Trading later as Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Ltd., the co-operative eventually closed in August 1983, the factory being demolished the following year. A new company, Triumph Motorcycles Ltd was established in 1984, and moved to Hinckley, Leicestershire, in 1988.

A housing development was built on the site of the Triumph motorcycle factory at Meriden, now known as Millisons Wood, up the hill out of the main village. Road names on the estate include Triumph motorcycle model names Bonneville Close and Daytona Drive. A plaque commemorating the site&#x27;s former use stands outside Bonneville Close.

<doc id="670043" wikidata="Q3088626" url="?curid=670043" title="Powell Peralta">
<text>Powell Peralta is an American skateboard company founded by George Powell and Stacy Peralta in 1978. The company rose to prominence in the 1980s as skateboarding began maturing as a sport. The company featured the Bones Brigade, a team featuring the era&#x27;s top competitors. Peralta left the company in 1991 and Powell continued to produce skateboard equipment as Powell, Bones Bearings and RollerBones. The two company founders reunited to produce the company&#x27;s now classic inventory under the name Powell Classic.

==Background==
George Powell studied engineering at Stanford University and started making homemade skateboards in 1957. In 1974, Powell&#x27;s son came and asked for a skateboard. When Powell pulled an old one out of the garage, his son complained it did not ride smoothly. Powell became interested in skateboarding again, as he realized urethane wheels improved a skateboard&#x27;s ride. With this prompting, Powell started making his own skateboards and wheels. He bought urethane and baked his own wheels. He also used some new materials like aluminum and fiberglass to fabricate his own composite boards. One of the test riders of one of his flexible slalom boards was Stacy Peralta.

When Powell was laid off from his job in the aerospace industry, he moved from Los Angeles to Santa Barbara to start his own skateboard manufacturing business. In 1976, Powell built the Quiksilver ProSlalom deck which he marketed through Sims. This was followed by the Quicktail.

== Foundation of Powell Peralta ==
In 1978, Powell teamed up with Stacy Peralta forming Powell Peralta. Peralta took over team management and advertising. In 1979 they created a skateboarding team called the Bones Brigade (name unrelated to the wheels).

===Members===
The &quot;Bones Brigade&quot; was a skateboarding team that rode under the Powell Peralta, and later, Powell banner. Notable Bones Brigade members throughout the years have included:
*Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Rodriguez
*Steve Saiz
*Ray Barbee
*Steve Caballero
*Alan Gelfand
*Tommy Guerrero
*Nicky Guerrero
*Kevin Harris
*Tony Hawk
*Brandon Novak
*Bucky Lasek
*Andy Macdonald
*Guy Mariano
*Cameron Martin
*Mike McGill
*Colin McKay
*Lance Mountain
*Rodney Mullen
*David &quot;Q&quot; Occhiuzzo
*Steve Rocco
*Chris Senn
*Jim Thiebaud
*Mike Vallely
*Danny Way
*Frankie Hill
*Per Welinder
*Ray Underhill
*Steve Steadham
* Jason Ellis

===Filmography===
Powell Peralta produced the Bones Brigade videos, starting in 1982, and they became some of the most influential skateboarding videos of the era:

*&quot;The Bones Brigade Video Show&quot; (1984)
*&quot;Future Primitive&quot; (1985)
*&quot;The Search for Animal Chin&quot; (1987)
*&quot;Public Domain&quot; (1988)
*&quot;Axe Rated&quot; (1988)
*&quot;Ban This&quot; (1989)
*&quot;Propaganda&quot; (1990)
*&quot;Eight&quot; (1991)
*&quot;Celebrity Tropical Fish&quot; (1991)
==Downturn and formation of Powell Corporation==
In the late 1980s, smaller companies like World Industries appeared and took market share from the bigger companies. Powell Peralta suffered as many of their riders defected and either set up or rode for those new independent companies. At the end of 1991, Stacy Peralta left Powell Peralta and the company was then re-branded as Powell Corporation.

===Filmography as Powell===

*&quot;Hot Batch&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Chaos&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Play&quot; (1993)
*&quot;Suburban Diners&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Scenic Drive&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Strip Mall Heroes&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Magic&quot; (1999)
*&quot;Bones Bearings Class of 2000&quot; (1999)
*&quot;FUN&quot; (2009)
===Bones Bearings===
Bones specializes in wheels. Powell continues to make skateboard products, including Bones Bearings and skateboard wheels.

==Reunion==
Powell Peralta has re-issued decks under the brand Powell Classic. George Powell and Stacy Peralta have teamed up once again to re-issue some of the original pro models under the Powell-Peralta brand. Current reissues include models from Steve Caballero, Ray &quot;Bones&quot; Rodriguez, Mike McGill, Steve Steadham, and Mike Vallely. In late 2010, Powell Skateboards and Powell Classic were folded into Powell-Peralta. The current team is Pros, which includes Steve Caballero.

In March 2011 it was announced that artist VCJ (Vernon Courtlandt Johnson) has returned to Powell-Peralta, and is working on new art for the brand.

==Cultural references==
Powell-Peralta Skateboards appeared in several films:
* The 1992 film &quot;Encino Man&quot; features Brendan Fraser&#x27;s character Link riding a Lance Mountain Family (art by Lance&#x27;s son) skateboard deck near the end. There is a Powell-Peralta poster clearly visible in Dave&#x27;s room.
* In the teen-angst/skateboard movie &quot;Gleaming The Cube&quot; (1989) starring Christian Slater, and featuring an early cameo from Tony Hawk, the &#x27;Crew&#x27; can be witnessed in one scene to be stickering skate transfers on public property, one or many of which are of Powell-Peralta design. Also, the main character Brian, as played by Slater, can be seen wearing some Powell-Peralta Lizard Bones Black Sweat Pants.
* Most of the Bones Brigade appeared in a skateboard sequence in &quot;Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol&quot; in 1987.
* In the 2009 single &quot;Skate or Die&quot; by Teenage Bottlerocket, the Bones Brigade was mentioned in the lyrics. &quot;We&#x27;re waging war against the poseurs of the day, If we play our cards right, Someday we might be on the Bones Brigade.&quot;
* The lead track &quot;Hornets! Hornets!&quot; on the Hold Steady&#x27;s 2005 album Separation Sunday references Bones Brigade with the lyrics &quot;She&#x27;s got those Bones Brigade videos. She knew &#x27;em back and forth. She slept with so many skaters.&quot;

The name of a Chilean hip-hop dance duo &quot;Power Peralta&quot; may possibly be inspired by the skateboard brand.

<text>Konstantinos Pollux Alexandros &quot;Dino&quot; Stamatopoulos (born December 14, 1964) is an American writer, producer, and actor. He has worked on TV programs such as &quot;Mr. Show&quot;, &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. He has also created multiple animated TV shows such as &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenhole&quot;, and &quot;High School USA!&quot;. As an actor, he is best known for his recurring role as the character Alex &quot;Star-Burns&quot; Osbourne on the NBC comedy series &quot;Community&quot;, on which he also worked as a producer, a consulting writer, and wrote two animated episodes.

==Early life==

Stamatopoulos attended Ridgewood High School in Norridge, Illinois.

==Career==
Stamatopoulos was hired on &quot;The Ben Stiller Show&quot; after Andy Dick convinced him to submit a spec script for a &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode. There, he met and worked with Bob Odenkirk. After Stiller&#x27;s show was canceled, he moved to New York City, where he wrote during the 1990s for &quot;The Dana Carvey Show&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; (also with Odenkirk), &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot;.

In 2000, Stamatopoulos and Robert Smigel pitched Comedy Central a spin-off of Smigel&#x27;s &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; cartoons (which were appearing singly as animated shorts on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episodes) as a half-hour sketch comedy show. The standalone &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; show premiered in 2000 but was canceled after one season. He later joined the writing staff on &quot;Mad TV&quot;.

Stamatopoulos worked as a creative consultant and contributing writer on the first season of &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot;, with Tim &amp; Eric and Bob Odenkirk. He also provided the voice of Drinky Crow on &quot;The Drinky Crow Show&quot;, which aired for one season on Adult Swim. His stop motion animated series &quot;Moral Orel&quot; premiered on Adult Swim on Christmas 2005 and aired for three seasons, airing its final episode in December 2008; a follow-up special aired in 2012. Following &quot;Moral Orel&quot;, Stamatopoulos created &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenhole&quot;, a stop motion series, for Adult Swim. It ran for two seasons from 2010 to 2012.

Stamatopoulos was a writer, consulting writer, producer and actor on the 2009 NBC sitcom &quot;Community&quot;. He wrote two animated episodes for the series, &quot;Abed&#x27;s Uncontrollable Christmas&quot; (2010) and &quot;G.I. Jeff&quot; (2014). He played the recurring role of Alex &quot;Star-Burns&quot; Osbourne, a character whose nickname derived from his large star-shaped sideburns. Together with &quot;Community&quot; creator Dan Harmon, Stamatopoulos started production company Starburns Industries.

A long-time fan of radio personality Steve Dahl, Stamatopoulos hosted a podcast, &quot;Sorry About Everything&quot;, from May 2012 until June 2013 on Dahl&#x27;s Steve Dahl Network.

Stamatopoulos and friend Andy Dick hosted a weekly podcast, &quot;Dino and Andy&#x27;s Skull Juice&quot;, which premiered in late 2016 and was initially produced by Feral Audio. Due to an on-air incident of hostility in mid-2018, Dick was asked to leave the podcast. Stamatopoulos asked friend and recurring guest Dana Snyder to replace Dick as co-host, and the podcast was renamed &quot;Dino &amp; Dana&#x27;s Safe Space&quot;. Additional co-hosts Laetitia &quot;Tish&quot; Burns and Spencer Crittenden were also given billing in the podcast.

==Personal life==
Stamatopoulos was married and has one daughter. He is a vocalist and guitarist in a rock band called Sorry About Everything.

<text>Gillian Lesley Gilbert (born 27 January 1961) is an English musician. She is the keyboardist and guitarist of the band New Order.

==Early life==
Gilbert&#x27;s family moved from her birthplace, Manchester, to the nearby market town of Macclesfield when she was young. She disliked living in Cheshire as a teenager and had wanted to live in Manchester. In the late 1970s, seeing Siouxsie and the Banshees play live on UK television was a life changing experience for her. &quot;Me dad always says to us, &#x27;You changed as soon as you saw Siouxsie and the Banshees on television&#x27;... And I really liked Gaye Advert out of the Adverts, who played bass, and I thought, &#x27;Oh, there&#x27;s nobody playin&#x27; guitar&#x27; - you know, women in bands.&quot; Her uncle taught her how to play guitar.

Gilbert was then in a punk band with three girls, the Inadequates, who rehearsed at premises next to Joy Division. In a 1987 interview with &quot;Option&quot;, Gilbert reflected on the first time she became familiar with Joy Division: &quot;We didn&#x27;t have a car and us three needed a lift home. So we asked them, and they said, &#x27;Alright, but you have to buy one of our singles.&#x27; So we did and got it home and played it on this horrible record player. We&#x27;d known Stephen [Morris] before. We thought, &#x27;My God, this sounds horrible.&#x27;&quot; She would later begin dating Morris.

==Career==
After Ian Curtis&#x27;s death in May 1980, the three remaining members of Joy Division started a new band called New Order. Wishing to complete their line-up with someone they knew well and whose musical skill and style was compatible with their own, New Order invited Gilbert to join the band during the early part of October 1980, as keyboardist and guitarist. She had already played with Joy Division a number of times, filling in for both Curtis and Bernard Sumner playing guitar. New Order&#x27;s manager Rob Gretton suggested she should join. Gilbert&#x27;s first live performance with them occurred at The Squat in Manchester on 25 October 1980.

Gilbert&#x27;s voice can be heard on several New Order tracks: the 1981 single &quot;Procession&quot;; the 1983 single &quot;Confusion&quot;; &quot;Avalanche&quot; from the album &quot;Republic&quot; on which she sang a single word, &quot;faith&quot;; and &quot;Doubts Even Here&quot; from their first album, &quot;Movement&quot;, on which she provided a spoken-word background vocal.

Fellow band members Sumner and Peter Hook had already produced music outside New Order, when Gilbert and Morris formed their own band, The Other Two. They released their first single &quot;Tasty Fish&quot; in 1991, and recorded two albums: &quot;The Other Two &amp; You&quot;, released in 1993, and &quot;Super Highways&quot; in 1999. Gilbert and Morris were engaged in 1993, and married the following year. The couple live in Rainow, outside Macclesfield, and have two daughters. Gilbert stopped touring with New Order in 1998 so that she could care for their children, one of whom suffers from neuromyelitis optica. Her husband had briefly offered to care for the children, but Gilbert reasoned that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. Gilbert participated in the recording of 2001&#x27;s &quot;Get Ready&quot;, after which she was replaced by Phil Cunningham in New Order&#x27;s line-up.

In 2007, Gilbert and Morris remixed two tracks for the Nine Inch Nails remixes album &quot;Year Zero Remixed&quot;. That year, Gilbert was diagnosed with breast cancer, from which she recovered.

Gilbert re-joined New Order in 2011, after a 10-year absence from their albums. The band had initially reformed, after 4 years, to play two benefit gigs for Michael Schamberg, video-producer and long-time friend. Speaking in a 2021 interview, Gilbert explained; &quot;It was up to me whether I wanted to carry on, really. It seemed quite pleasant at the time, so yeah, just went for it&quot;. Gilbert performed alongside Cunningham (who remained a member), expanding the group to a quintet. Gilbert is quoted as saying that she felt glad that she had done other things during her time away from the band. Speaking about recording new material, Gilbert explained; “I figured doing an EP might be OK, but Bernard wanted to do a whole record. That made me think about the bad old days, especially &quot;Get Ready&quot;, when I’d been glad to get out of it all. But the bad old relationships around Factory had gone, which had caused a lot of problems with a hierarchy becoming established within the band. Phil and Tom are very easy-going. It was a refreshing new start, where I felt that I could do anything – so I did. I came in to &quot;Music Complete&quot; with a lot of ideas, and it was a record where everyone’s ideas were thrown in together.&quot;

Since 2011, New Order have performed across the world. Their album &quot;Music Complete&quot; was released in September 2015. Gilbert&#x27;s vocals were featured on a Koishii &amp; Hush remix album titled &quot;Lifetime&quot;; it was released on 3 February 2016, and featured four tracks remixed by artists such as Saltmarine, Lavigne, FM Attack and Re:Locate. 
In 2021 Gilbert contributed to a band interview reflecting on the previous 10 years of New Order

<text>ROBODoc is a documentation tool similar to Javadoc and licensed under the GPL. It is used to extract API documentation from source code. It can be used with any language that supports comments and works by extracting specially formatted headers. These are then reformatted into HTML, DocBook, TROFF, ASCII, LaTeX, PDF, or RTF.

It can be used to document any programming artifact, such as: classes, functions, tests, makefile entries, etc.

ROBODoc works with C, C++, Fortran, Perl, shell scripts, Assembler, DCL, DB/C, Tcl/Tk, Forth, Lisp, COBOL, Occam, Basic, HTML, Clarion, and any other language that supports comments.

==History==

The first version of ROBODoc was written by Jacco van Weert in 1995. ROBODoc was inspired by the Autodocs program that was available on the Amiga. Autodocs produced ASCII output only. Jacco created a version that created output in Amigaguide format. This made it possible to create hyperlinks between the various documentation parts.

<text>The Governorate of Estonia, also known as the Esthonia (Estland) Governorate, was a province (&quot;guberniya&quot;) and one of the Baltic governorates of the Russian Empire. It was located in the northern Estonia with some islands in the West Estonian archipelago, including Hiiumaa and Vormsi. Previously, the Reval Governorate existed during Peter I&#x27;s reign and was confirmed by the Treaty of Nystad, which ceded territory from Sweden to the newly established Russian Empire. The Estonia Governorate was established in 1796 when Paul I&#x27;s reforms abolished the Reval Viceroyalty. The port city of Reval (known in Russian as Revel, contemporary Tallinn) was the administrative centre where the governor had his seat.

From the 1850s to 1914, the Estonian national awakening influenced and characterized the governorate by general modernization, the reorganization into a modern European society, and the success of the newly emerged nationalist awareness. The accession of Alexander III in 1881 marked the beginning of a period of more rigid Russification; the previous Baltic civil and criminal codes were replaced with Russian ones, and the Russian language replaced the German language and Estonian language. Jaan Tõnisson founded the National Liberal Party and organized its first congress in 1905, in the course of the First Russian Revolution; in response, the Russian government suppressed the revolution by declaring martial law, causing Konstantin Päts and the radical leader Jaan Teemant to flee abroad. The governorate gained more territories from the Governorate of Livonia and was granted autonomy on 12 April 1917, and lasted for nearly a year. The Estonian independence that came on 24 February 1918 marked the permanent end for the governorate.

Until the late 19th century the governorate was administered independently by the local Baltic German nobility through a feudal Regional Council.

== History ==

From 1561, Estonia had been under the control as a dominion of the Swedish Empire following the annexation of the northern part of the Livonian Confederation, in which nobilies swore obedience to the Swedish king Eric XIV as the Russians, in 1558, invaded Livonia, which prompted the Livonian War. The Treaty of Plussa forced Russia to cede to Sweden possessions along the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland, including northern Livonia and Ingria.

Seeking to regain lost territories, in 1701, Tsar Peter I and his allies invaded Sweden, beginning the Great Northern War. He initially met with setbacks by King Charles XII but later gained triumphs. In 1710, the Russians advanced into Estonia and Livonia, which were incorporated into Russia. In the Treaty of Nystad of 1721, Sweden formally ceded its former dominion of Estonia, Livonia, and its other territories to Russia, whereas Russia paid Sweden compensation of 2 million efimki (1.3 million rubles).

Initially named Reval Governorate after the city of Reval (now known as Tallinn), it was established in 1719 by decree of Peter the Great on 29 May, on the territory that was acquired from Sweden, along with the Riga Governorate. In 1783, the Reval Viceroyalty was formed from Reval Governorate, and in 1796, together with Narva county, which was separated from Saint Petersburg Governorate, Estonia Governorate was formed. During the reign of the Swedish kings, there was a tendency towards granting more autonomy to the peasantry, but under the Russian tsars, there was a shift towards tighter regulation. Serfdom remained in place until its abolition in 1816.

=== Rise of the Estonian cultural identity ===

The early course of the reign of Alexander II marked the emergence of the Estonian national movement, which periodised the so-called Estonian age of awakening that led to the birth of a distinctive Estonian national culture and laid the groundwork for its growing roles in Baltic politics. As agricultural reforms, the spread of education, increasing communication beyond the Baltic, and the spirit of reformation were factors in the national awakening, from 1860, the Estonian national movement had gained more support from rising Estonians. Although many Estonians still continued to assimilate into the German and Russian cultures, many nationwide efforts to promote the Estonian culture were seen, especially for the , the Society of Estonian Literati, and the all-Estonian song festivals.
The prominent figure in the period was Carl Robert Jakobson from the neighbouring Governorate of Livonia; he opposed the Baltic German dominance and took an anti-clerical position on the Lutheran Church. He had also begun campaigning for the introduction of zemstvo, which had already existed in the empire; in June 1881, seventeen Estonian societies requested that they do so with equal representations for Germans and Estonians, in a memorandum to Alexander III. As a result, four of the ten points of the memorandum were implemented at the end of the 1880s.

Also in this era, poet Lydia Koidula had been a prominent figure in the advocation of Estonian literature; she wrote her most important work, &quot;&quot; (The Nightingale of Emajõgi), which was published in 1867. Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald composed his epic &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot;, in which he portrayed the mythological adventures of the eponymous hero, who had ended up in chains at the gate of Hell and the promise of a return to home; &quot;Kalevipoeg&quot; has been later considered the national epic. Among Koidula and Kreutzwald were Mihkel Veske, Ado Reinvald, Friedrich Kuhlbars, and others. Many works in this era reflected the condition of rural people and satirised the elites. Publication of Estonian-language print grew rapidly from 1860 to 1900, and the number of books and brochures six times increased, from 55 to 312. According to the 1897 census, 96.9 per cent of Estonians, 10 years and older, could read and write, making the northern Baltic area the most literate region of the empire.

=== Russification ===

In 1885, the new governor of Estonia, Sergey Shakhovskoy, was appointed by Emperor Alexander III, who had seemed to think the father&#x27;s reforms were a threat to Russian culture; this marked the beginning of the Russification process in Estonia. In 1877, the Russian urban reform of 1870 took place in the Baltic area. The new law enfranchised men 25 years of age and over, which was divided into three curiae according to the city taxes they paid, replacing the medieval estate-based system that had excluded Estonians from participation in the municipal government. Virtually all Estonians, in fact, belonged to the third curia since their begeoisie was only beginning to improve its economic position. The 1892 municipal law, in which the franchise base was determined by property value, was implemented in the Baltic provinces; for Estonians, it would increase the possibility of winning over the Baltic German hegemony, and for the begeoisie, it would be a step forward to put all voters in the same place.

In 1888–1889, the Russification of the police system took place: the Baltic Germans lost all police powers in the rural township, although they retained powers on their estates; and the police system at county and urban levels was reorganised and placed under the Minister of Internal Affairs, by which all higher police officers were appointed. The new Russian officers regarded Estonian local affairs with disinterest, and its population was more impartial than the German ones, although they were non-Estonian. The Russification of jurisdiction, although the Baltic legal codes remained unchanged, was taken as well, by which the peasantry had its own courts, the township court, with appeals to the higher court for the peasantry. In 1864, the Russian institution reform was introduced, which brought more impartial justice: the justice of the peace with appeals to the conference of justices of the peace; and the circuit court with appeals to the court chamber. The major problem was that proceedings in the higher court were conducted exclusively in Russian, which meant the Estonians, who did not fluent in Russian, were forced to hire translators or lawyers, involving a prohibitive expense for destitute Estonians.

Russification policies had also been taken in education: placing all Lutheran rural elementary schools under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education; creating the position of director and inspector so the ministry insured the state control; and introducing Russian as an instruction language in the third year of the school in 1887 and then the first year in 1892. Initially, the result of Russification was disorganised: many schools, which the Baltic Germans withdrew support for as a protest, were closed; much of the teaching personnel were unable to teach Russian; and the number of pupils in the governorate declined, from 25,646 to 20,565 between 1886 and 1892.
The Russian Orthodoxy came unexpectedly into the Baltic area in the 1840s, causing the struggle between the Orthodox and the Lutheran churches, which had attended since the Northern Crusades, for the allegiance of Estonians. There, the Russification process was also performed for religious purposes. In 1883, in Wiek county, the conversation movement among 3,400 Estonian peasants began, which had the motivation of strong anti-German sentiment. During his first tenure as governor, Shakhovskoy sought to propagate Orthodoxy in his ruling governorate, which caused spiritual dissatisfaction among the Baltic natives who lived under a German-controlled Protestantism. In 1886, Shakhovskoy suggested to the procurator of the Holy Synod, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, that Orthodoxy was the quickest way to unite the Estonians into the &quot;great Russian family&quot;. Furthermore, in 1885, Alexander III reinstated that children of mixed Lutheran-Orthodox marriages be only baptised as Orthodox, and the reconverts to Lutheranism were again considered members of the state church.

The major factor that was unavoidable in internal affairs was the gradual introduction of Russian as the language in administration in 1885; by 1889, Russian had become the language in municipal government and exclusively in higher courts, as well as in communication among all administrative organs. Estonian intelligentsia, which had sought equal rights for Estonian as an administrative language and had been rooted in a Baltic &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, proved this aspect of Russification disorienting. Some of them, who had received their education in German, were able to retool themselves, but it was a long process.

=== 1905 Revolution ===

With the rise of the liberation movement in Russia, all-Empire questions began to impinge on Estonian life, as well as a new generation emerged in Estonia. The crucial point in social and political thought was the appearance of journalistic voices for the lower class, engaging in the fade of loyalty to the crown. Many intellectuals emerged in the post-Russification era; among them were Jaan Tõnisson, who represented a renewal of the moderate political orientation, and Konstantin Päts, the editor of &quot;Teataja&quot; in Reval.

In 1905, the massacre on Bloody Sunday became the final straw that brought about the revolution, whose impulse had spread into the rural area of the Baltic region; the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party organised activity in Estonia, with its counterpart formed in August. The worker strikes broke out in Reval, Narva, and Pernau in January 1905. In the rural area, 120 manor houses, which were the symbol of Baltic German power, were put to the torch by Estonians. Mass meetings called for peaceful reform in Reval, and the situation remained calm until 16 October; the Russian Army on that day, however, opened fire on a peaceful demonstration on a market square, which was later known as the Tallinn Bloodbath.

In November 1905, Jaan Tõnisson founded the Estonian Progressive People&#x27;s Party, which, along with the Baltic German-led Baltic Constitutional Party, was the only legal party in the governorate at that time. The All-Estonian Congress was held by Tõnisson and his moderates on 27–29 November, with the authority permitting that. Following the dispute over the election of vice-chairs, the congress was split into two factions: the moderates, known as the &quot;Bürgermusse&quot;; and the radicals, known as the &quot;Aula&quot;. Nevertheless, both factions demanded the repeal of Russification; the moderates demanded the unification of Estonia and northern Livonia with an autonomous self-government.

In early December, the Russian government began to react with force to what it described as &quot;revolutionary excesses&quot;: martial law was declared in Reval and the Harrien County on 10 December; the Russian army and local Baltic German militias, known as &quot;Selbstschutz&quot;, began to scour cities and the countryside for participants in the 1905 revolution; and much of the local committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and Estonian intellectuals were arrested. In the governorate alone, 300 people were executed, 600 received some form of corporal punishment, and 500 were sentenced to hard labour in Siberia or elsewhere. Konstantin Päts and Jaan Teemant, the radical leader, fled to Finland and then to Western Europe; both had reasons to fear for their freedom.

=== World War I and path to independence ===
The outbreak of World War I was greeted by mixed reactions in the governorate. Within the Estonian population, there was some enthusiasm for a struggle against a historical enemy; for the Baltic Germans, however, it was unthinkable to fight against their co-nationals—the imperial Germans. Increasingly suspicious of possible collaboration with the imperial Germans, the Russian authorities closed down German schools and forbade using German in public. Restrictions were also included for using Estonian. About 100,000 men, nearly 10 percent of the Estonian population, were mobilised into the Russian Imperial Army; their extent of casualties is little known, and no reliable sources are available. The Estonians considered that fighting against foes—the Germans and the Austrians—was easy to transfer the enmity they felt towards the Baltic Germans, who were the representatives of the German-speaking cultural world; however, the Baltic German leadership also declared encouragement for Russia.

By the time the Russian Empire was crumbling, the Estonian desire for unification of the Estonian-speaking area, especially the entire Estonia and northern Livonia, had come into focus. Following the February Revolution in Russia, the Russian Provisional Government was proclaimed, and the clash on the Eastern Front was still ongoing. Seeing this moment as an opportunity to fulfil what they had wanted, Jaan Tõnisson and his moderate politicians lobbied the provisional government for changes in the northern Baltic area. In conjunction with a mass demonstration attended by 40,000 Estonians in Petrograd, the government agreed on to reorganise the self-government in the northern Baltic. The decree consisted of the merger of the governorate of Estonia with the northern counties of the governorate of Livonia—Dorpat, Fellin, Ösel, Pernau, Werro, and some portions of Walk—into the consilidated governorate, which accomplished what Carl Robert Jakobson had expressed, creating the autonomous polity known as &quot;Estonia&quot;. The decree also established a temporary zemstvo with the provincial assembly as its head. In addition, Baltic German-controlled diets and imperial local administrative organs were dissolved.

In April, the provisional government appointed the Reval Mayor Jaan Poska as the first commissar, followed by, in May, elections of the provincial assembly known as &quot;Maapäev&quot;, in which political parties emerged on a broad basis for the first time, with the largest blocs being the Agrarian League and the Labour Party. The municipal elections in 1917, however, proved the significant fractionalisation of the political spectrum, as the configuration of party groupings was unstable. Predominantly, the moderates dominated the smaller urban areas, while the lefts dominated stronger in the larger industrial cities. In the early course, the soviets that emerged in Estonia were the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, who concentrated in major cities and military garrisons. Although permission of principle for the formation of national military units was granted in April, the Minister of War Alexander Kerensky restricted the establishment of a single regiment due to pressure from the Soviets. Nevertheless, the first Estonian regiment had grown to 8,000 men by the end of July, twice as large as originally intended, and the provisional government approved the formation of a second regiment in September.
After the successful October Revolution in Petrograd, the Estonian Military Revolutionary Committee, led by Viktor Kingissepp, took power from the provisional government&#x27;s commissar. The Bolsheviks were, however, unable to consolidate their power owing to the lack of Bolshevik officials who could replace the former government&#x27;s public officials; the latter refused and launched the strike. The Estonian Bolsheviks had lost much of their popular support by the end of January 1918, engaging in the cancellation of the Estonian Constituent Assembly election held on . With the German advance in southern Livonia and Estonia and the Bolsheviks fleeing to Soviet Russia, the Estonian Provincial Assembly asserted Estonia &quot;independent and democratic republic&quot; within its &quot;historical and ethnographical borders&quot; on 24 February, with Konstantin Päts being the leader of the new provisional government. This was nonetheless a symbolic indication, and the Germans, on the following day, entered Reval.

== Geography ==
The Governorate of Estonia was the northernmost of the Baltic governorates, located on the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland. It was bordered with the Baltic Sea in the west, the Gulf of Finland in the north, the Saint Petersburg Governorate in the east, and the Governorate of Livonia and Lake Peipus in the south. The westernmost point was Cape Kalana in Hiiumaa; in the east, the Narva river near the city of Narva; Cape Stenskär in the north; Kõrksaar in the Pärnu Bay in the south. The land border was in the west, in the north, in the east with Saint Petersburg Governorate along the Neva, and with Lake Peipus and Governorate of Livonia in the south. The provincial border between Wierland and Dorpat counties was long, and between Wierland and Fellin counties was long.

Physically, the governorate was situated on the East European Plain, where the uplands and plateau structures were interspersed with lowlands and valley structures. It consisted of the limestone plateau, the northern part of which formed the North Estonian Klint. The highest areas were Pandivere and Jõhvi Uplands; the Pandivere was where the Emumägi, the highest point in the governorate, was located. In the west, the large area was entirely flat, forming the lowlands of West Estonia and the Moonsund archipelago. The scarps of the Ösel and Moon islands and those in the western continental area formed the Silurian Klint. Crystalline rocks formed in the lowest part of the basement; in the northeastern part, the crystalline rocks were 60–70 metres below the surface. Below the surface, the area also consisted of a large amount of phosphorite, especially in Wesenberg deposits, and kukersite oil shales within the Baltic Oil Shale Basin.
In the west, it is the location of the Moonsund archipelago, which was shared with the Governorate of Livonia. There are about 80 islands in the governorate, of which Dagö (known in modern times as Hiiumaa) was the largest, with an area of . Other islands in the archipelago were Worms, Kassar, Groß Pakri and Klein Pakri, and Nargen.

The area of the Governorate of Estonia was ; of this, were the mainland and were the islands, with were the of Lake Peipsi as a part the governorate.

The governorate consisted of the northern Estonia, approximately corresponding to: Harju, Lääne-Viru, Ida-Viru, Rapla, Järva, Lääne and Hiiu counties, and a small portion of Pärnu County.

<text>Dagoberto Campaneris Blanco (born March 9, 1942), nicknamed &quot;Bert&quot; or &quot;Campy&quot;, is a Cuban American former professional baseball shortstop, who played Major League Baseball (MLB) for four American League (AL) teams, primarily the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics. One of the mainstays of the Athletics&#x27; championship teams of 1972 to 1974, he holds the A&#x27;s franchise records for career games played (1795), hits (1882), and at bats (7180). In 2019, Campaneris was inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame.

Campaneris led the AL in stolen bases six times between 1965 and 1972 and retired with the seventh-most steals in MLB history (649). Defensively, he led the league in putouts three times; his career totals at shortstop place him among the all-time MLB leaders in games played (5th, 2097) and double plays (7th, 1186), at that position. Campaneris is the second cousin of former MLB player Jose Cardenal, growing up near each other in Matanzas, Cuba.

==Professional career==
Campaneris attracted the attention of major league scouts while playing with the Cuba national baseball team at the 1961 Amateur World Series, along with Tito Fuentes and José Miguel Pineda. He was signed by Kansas City Athletics scout Felix Delgado, who agreed to a $1,000 bonus if he remained with the A’s organization for at least 60 days. Campaneris was one of the last players to sign with a major league team before the Cuban Revolution made emigration extremely rare.”

A small player at and , Cuban-born Campaneris was a key figure on the A&#x27;s of the 1960s and 1970s. In his debut with Kansas City on July 23, 1964, Campaneris hit two home runs, the first coming on the first pitch thrown to him by Jim Kaat of the Minnesota Twins. He is one of only five players in major league history to hit two home runs in his first game; Bob Nieman (), Mark Quinn (), J. P. Arencibia (), and Trevor Story () are the others to accomplish this feat. Just called up that day from Double-A Birmingham, he also singled, walked, and stole a base.

On July 23, 1964, Campy Campaneris was introduced on air by Monte Moore, announcer, by explaining a promotional gimmick by Charlie O. Finley, of Campy riding a donkey in from the bullpen.

In 1965, Campaneris led Kansas City in batting average (.270), and shared the league lead in triples (twelve, with 1965 AL MVP Zoilo Versailles) and stolen bases (51). His 51 stolen bases were the highest total by an Athletics player since Eddie Collins stole 58 in (when the team was based in Philadelphia). He also broke Luis Aparicio&#x27;s nine-year run of the American League stolen base title. In he finished tenth in the voting for the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award after having a similar season at the plate but playing more regularly at shortstop. When the Athletics moved to Oakland in 1968, Campaneris led the league in hits (177), steals (62), and at bats (642); the last mark was an Oakland record until Johnny Damon broke it in 2001. 

Between June 10 and June 21, 1969, Campaneris set a major league record by stealing a base in twelve consecutive games, a record which still stands as of 2021.

In 1970, Campaneris batted .279 with career highs of 22 home runs and 64 runs batted in while leading the league in steals for the fifth time (42) and scoring 97 runs. He improved consistently on defense; his six double plays in an extra-inning game on September 13 of that year set an AL record. In 1972, he led AL shortstops with 795 total chances while also breaking Collins&#x27; franchise record of 376 steals. An avid bunter, he led the league in sacrifice hits in 1972 (twenty), (forty) and (25).

In his postseason career of 37 games, he had eleven runs batted in (RBI) with three home runs, four doubles and a triple while also scoring fifteen runs and stealing six bases.

In 1972, Campaneris was second in American League shortstop All-Star voting behind Luis Aparicio. Aparicio could not play and all-star manager, and future hall of famer, Earl Weaver, picked all-star reserve Toby Harrah to start rather than Campaneris who was Aparicio&#x27;s original all-star reserve. When Harrah was injured, Weaver picked his own Orioles player, Bobby Grich, to not only replace Harrah, but to start over Campaneris. The game went 10 innings and Weaver played Grich the entire game at shortstop, instead of allowing Campaneris a chance to play at all. Campaneris&#x27; teammate Reggie Jackson reported Campaneris was extremely angry after the game. Campaneris responded to Weaver&#x27;s slight by his future stellar play against the Orioles. In the 1973 playoffs against the Orioles, which Oakland won 3-2, he led off game two with a home run, stole two bases and scored two runs. In game three, he hit a game-winning home run in the 11th inning. In five games he had a .308 batting average, 16 hits, 9 runs scored, 6 RBI, 6 stolen bases and 3 home runs. 

In Game 2 of the 1972 American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers, Campaneris already had three hits, two steals, and two runs when he faced pitcher Lerrin LaGrow in the seventh inning. After a pitch hit him in the ankle, Campaneris threw his bat at LaGrow. The benches cleared, with Detroit manager Billy Martin going after Campaneris; both Campaneris and LaGrow were ejected. Campaneris was fined $500 and suspended for the rest of the ALCS by American League President Joe Cronin. MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn added a seven-day suspension to the start of the next season but permitted Campaneris to play in the World Series victory over the Cincinnati Reds.

In the 1973 American League Championship Series, in which the A&#x27;s defeated the Baltimore Orioles, he led off Game 2 with a home run, and won Game 3 with a leadoff home run in the eleventh inning. In Game 7 of the 1973 World Series against the New York Mets, both he and Reggie Jackson hit two-run home runs in the third inning off Jon Matlack—the only two home runs Oakland hit the entire series. The A&#x27;s took a 4–0 lead and went on to win to repeat as world champions; Campaneris caught Wayne Garrett&#x27;s pop-up for the final out of the Series. In 1974, he broke Jimmy Dykes&#x27; franchise mark for career at bats (6,023), and in 1976, he broke Dykes&#x27; mark for games played (1,702), as well as Al Simmons&#x27; Athletics record of 1,827 career hits.

After the 1976 season, he signed with the Texas Rangers, but he saw his playing time reduced in 1978. In May 1979, he was traded to the California Angels, splitting time at shortstop over the next two seasons with Jim Anderson and Freddie Patek before playing as a reserve third baseman in 1981. 

After spending 1982 in the Mexican League, Campaneris returned to the majors in 1983 with Billy Martin&#x27;s New York Yankees, where he batted a career-high .322 in sixty games at second and third base before retiring.

In his 19-year career, Campaneris batted .259 with 79 home runs, 646 RBI, 1,181 runs, 2,249 hits, 313 doubles, and 86 triples in 2,328 games. His 649 stolen bases place him fourteenth in major league history, behind only Ty Cobb and Eddie Collins in the AL. His Athletics record of 566 steals was broken by Rickey Henderson in . Henderson also surpassed his Oakland records for career triples, if limited to Oakland and excluding Campaneris&#x27;s triples for the Kansas City Athletics from 1964-1967. Neither Campaneris or Henderson is in the top 10 of all time Athletics triples leaders, where Danny Murphy leads with 102. 

Campaneris still retains the Athletics franchise records for career games (1,702), at bats (7,180 at bats), putouts (2,932), assists (5,021) and double plays (934) at shortstop. Henderson walked over 700 more times than Campaneris (1,227 to 504), but Campaneris had over 1,000 more at bats (7,180 to 6,140), more sacrifice hits (156-59), and both were hit by pitches 55 times; giving Campaneris the most plate appearances for the Athletics.

===Playing all nine positions===

In 1965, Campaneris became the first player to play every position in a major league game in a thirteen-inning 5–3 loss to the California Angels at Municipal Stadium on September 8. It was an attempt by owner Charlie Finley to sell more tickets, which succeeded as the attendance that Wednesday night was 21,576. Playing a different position in each of the first nine innings, Campaneris started at shortstop, then shifted to second base, third base, left field, center field, right field, first base, pitcher, and catcher. On the mound, he pitched ambidextrously, throwing lefty to left-handers, and switched against right-handers. His night ended when he sustained a minor left shoulder injury while tagging out Ed Kirkpatrick in a collision at home plate to end the top of the ninth.

Since then, César Tovar (Twins, ), Scott Sheldon (Rangers, ), Shane Halter (Tigers, 2000), and Andrew Romine (Tigers, ) have joined this select list of nine-position players in a major league game. On March 12, 2015, actor Will Ferrell played in five Major League Baseball Spring training games at all nine positions to honor Campaneris. 

==Post-baseball career==
Following his retirement, Campaneris wanted to coach in the Major Leagues, but no one gave him a chance. He then landed a few minor league opportunities, until the Seibu Lions offered him a job to coach defense and base running with them in 1987. The Lions won the Japan Series in both 1987 and 1988. Afterwards, Campaneris played for the Gold Coast Suns of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in its inaugural season of 1989. As the oldest everyday player in the league at 47, he hit .291 and stole 16 bases in 60 games.

Campaneris currently lives in Scottsdale, Arizona, and often participates in Old-Timers&#x27; games around the country. He also conducts baseball camps and is an active participant in the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association, often playing in charity golf tournaments.

<text>Hamath-zobah was a place of uncertain location in Aram or Ancient Israel. According to , it was conquered by Solomon and thus figured in his only military engagement alluded to in the Books of Chronicles. It is not referred to in the parallel or source passage in 1 Kings 9. 

Hamath and Zobah were likely adjoining kingdoms, whence the compound name &quot;Hamath-Zobah&quot;, an idea supported by mention of wars between Hadadezer of Zobah and Toi of Hamath in 2 Samuel 8:9-10. According to Martin J. Selman, the existence of a joint name &quot;Hamath-Zobah&quot; indicated that by the time of Solomon the two kingdoms had joined into a single polity.

<text>Crystal Springs Regional Trail is a county park located between San Bruno to the north and Woodside to the south. The park comprises three main trails: Crystal Springs Trail on the south, Sawyer Camp Trail in the middle, and San Andreas Trail in the northern section, which run along the eastern shore of San Andreas Lake in San Mateo County.

Settled thousands of years ago by the Shalshone Indians, the Crystal Springs Reservoir (separate from San Andreas Lake to the north) is currently part of the City of San Francisco&#x27;s Hetch Hetchy Reservoir water system.

Crystal Springs reservoir is long and narrow because it lies atop the San Andreas Fault. The famous fault runs right through the Crystal Springs Reservoir. Satellite images and maps show the long narrow San Andreas rift continuing north of San Francisco in Tomales Bay, in Point Reyes National Seashore in a straight line. The Crystal Springs Dam survived both the 1906 earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta quake with no damage whatsoever, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

<text>The Committee of Safety, formally the Citizen&#x27;s Committee of Public Safety, was a 13-member group of the Annexation Club. The group was composed of mostly Hawaiian subjects of American descent and American citizens who were members of the Missionary Party, as well as some foreign residents in the Kingdom of Hawaii. The group planned and carried out the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve annexation of Hawaii by the United States. The new independent Republic of Hawaii government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President Grover Cleveland, and it was not until 1898 and under the administration of William McKinley that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. Territory of Hawaii.

==Formation==
The Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the &quot;Committee of Nine&quot; was formed January 14, 1883, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature. For the following elections of 1886 the committee reconvened, this time calling themselves the &quot;Committee of Thirteen&quot; due to the change in members. Their intent was to make the Independent Party the majority party in the legislature. At the end of the elections the Independents won ten seats, a net loss of three seats.

==Hawaiian League==

In January 1887 the Committee of Thirteen formed a secret society called the Hawaiian League. No official records were kept, but Lorrin A. Thurston (the grandson of American missionaries Asa Thurston and Lorrin Andrews) drafted the group&#x27;s constitution. The group was headed by an executive committee of lawyers and businessmen mostly of non-aboriginal non-indigenous naturalized United States citizens. Membership grew through the year, including some German and British citizens, and a few part-Hawaiians.
Although the politicians changed the name of their party from &quot;Missionary&quot; to &quot;Reform&quot;, many wanted to become part of the United States, not just reform the monarchy. 
This was why the Hawaiian League was also called the Annexation Club, although not often in public.

The Hawaiian League came into control of the Honolulu Rifles. Made of about 200 armed local (non-native) men, who fought under the command of enthusiastic annexationist Volney V. Ashford.
In June 1887, the Hawaiian League used the Rifles to force King Kalākaua to enact the Bayonet Constitution which limited his power. 
After Queen Liliuokalani came to power in 1891, she attempted to restore power to the throne. This caused the group to act again.

==Overthrow==

The precipitating event leading to the overthrow was the attempt by Queen Liliuokalani to promulgate a new constitution which would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature in which Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power, a political situation that was a direct result of the 1887 constitution. The conspirators&#x27; stated goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii&#x27;s annexation to the United States.

On January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson was tipped off to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member Committee of Safety and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard Samuel Nowlein had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen.

The Revolution ignited on January 17 when a policeman was shot and wounded while trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles. The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to root out the conspirators and stop the coup before it could begin. The Rifles garrisoned Ali&#x27;iolani Hale across the street from ʻIolani Palace and waited for the Queen&#x27;s response.

As these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu. United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and marines aboard the USS &quot;Boston&quot; in Honolulu Harbor came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. The sailors and marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served to intimidate royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, &quot;the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.&quot; Due to the Queen&#x27;s desire &quot;to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life&quot; for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.

The Committee of Safety issued the following proclamation, read aloud on January 17 by its chairman Henry E. Cooper to a large crowd assembled in front of the royal residence Iolani Palace:
&quot;First – The Hawaiian monarchial system of government is hereby abrogated.

Second – A Provisional Government for the control and management of public affairs and the protection of public peace is hereby established, to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon&quot;.

The Hawaiian League unofficially adopted the American Flag to appeal to the US and promote annexation. The flag was raised over ʻIolani Palace by Stevens on January 17, 1893. The flag was eventually lowered by James H. Blount that April for spreading a false presumption that the US had taken control.

==International response==
During the overthrow, the Japanese Imperial Navy gunboat &quot;Naniwa&quot; was docked at Pearl Harbor. The gunboat&#x27;s commander, Heihachiro Togo, who later commanded the Japanese battleship fleet at Tsushima, refused to accede to the Provisional Government&#x27;s demands that he strike the colors of the Kingdom, but later lowered the colors on order of the Japanese Government. Along with every other international legations in Honolulu, the Japanese Consulate-General, Suburo Fujii, quickly recognized the Provisional Government as the legitimate successor to the monarchy.

Every government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow, including the United States. Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Japan, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Denmark, Belgium, China, Peru, and France. When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November.

<doc id="670076" wikidata="Q2708193" url="?curid=670076" title="Lili Damita">
<text>Lili Damita (born Liliane Marie-Madeleine Carré; 10 July 1904 – 21 March 1994) was a French-American actress, singer, and dancer who appeared in 33 films between 1922 and 1937.

==Early life and education==
Lili Damita was born in Blaye, France, on 10 July 1904. Her father was an officer. She was educated in convents and ballet schools in her native France, as well as Spain and Portugal. At 14, she was enrolled as a dancer at the Paris Opera.

==Early career in revue, modeling and German film==
As a teenager, she was performing in popular music halls, eventually appearing in the Revue at the Casino de Paris. She worked as a photographic model. Offered a role in film as a prize for winning a magazine beauty competition in 1921, she appeared in several silent films before being offered her first leading role in &quot;Das Spielzeug von Paris&quot; (1925) by Hungarian-born director Michael Curtiz. She was an instant success, and Curtiz directed her in two more films: &quot;Fiaker Nr. 13&quot; (1926) and &quot;Der goldene Schmetterling&quot; (1926). Damita continued appearing next in German productions directed by Robert Wiene (&quot;Die große Abenteuerin&quot;; 1928), G.W. Pabst (&quot;Man spielt nicht mit der Liebe&quot;; 1926) and British director Graham Cutts (&quot;The Queen Was in the Parlour&quot;; 1927).

==Hollywood career==
In 1928, Damita was invited to Hollywood by Samuel Goldwyn and made her American film debut in &quot;The Rescue&quot;. She was leased out to various studios, appearing with stars and leading men such as Maurice Chevalier, Laurence Olivier, James Cagney, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant. Her films included box office successes &quot;The Cock-Eyed World&quot; (1929), the semi-silent &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; (1929) and &quot;This Is the Night&quot; (1932).

==Personal life==

Following a lengthy affair with Curtiz, and a relationship with Prince Louis Ferdinand, grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, she married the then-unknown actor Errol Flynn in 1935 and retired from the screen. Flynn soon became one of Hollywood&#x27;s biggest box office attractions, and in 1941 they had a son, Sean Flynn. The couple had an acrimonious divorce in 1942. 
According to her ex husband&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;, Damita was unstable and violent throughout the tumultuous relationship. She is portrayed by Barbara Hershey in the 1985 TV movie based on the book.

In 1962, while living in Palm Beach, Florida, Damita married Allen Loomis, a retired Fort Dodge, Iowa, dairy product manufacturer, and spent part of each year living there. They divorced in the mid-80s.

During the Cambodian Civil War (Khmer Rouge reign), her son Sean Flynn was working as a freelance photo journalist under contract to &quot;Time&quot; magazine when he and fellow journalist Dana Stone went missing on the road south of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 6 April 1970. Although Damita spent an enormous amount of money searching for her son, he was never found, and in 1984 he was declared legally dead.

==Death==
Damita died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on 21 March 1994, in Palm Beach, Florida, aged 89. She was interred in the Oakland Cemetery in Fort Dodge, Iowa, her last husband&#x27;s hometown.

<doc id="670087" wikidata="Q507772" url="?curid=670087" title="Andrew Strauss">
<text>Sir Andrew John Strauss (born 2 March 1977) is an English cricket administrator and former player, formerly the Director of Cricket for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). He played county cricket for Middlesex, and captained the England national team in all formats of the game. A fluent left-handed opening batsman, Strauss favoured scoring off the back foot, mostly playing cut and pull shots. He was also known for his fielding strength at slip or in the covers.

Strauss made his first-class debut in 1998, and his One Day International (ODI) debut in Sri Lanka in 2003. He quickly rose to fame on his Test match debut replacing the injured Michael Vaughan at Lord&#x27;s against New Zealand in 2004. With scores of 112 and 83 (run out) in an England victory, and the man of the match award, he became only the fourth batsman to score a century at Lord&#x27;s on his debut and was close to becoming the first Englishman to score centuries in both innings of his debut. Strauss again nearly scored two centuries (126 and 94 not out) and was named man of the match in his first overseas Test match, in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in December 2004. He suffered a drop in form during 2007, and as a result he was left out of the Test squad for England&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka, and announced that he was taking a break from cricket. After a poor tour for England, he was recalled into the squad for the 2008 tour of New Zealand and subsequently re-established himself in the side with a career-best 177 in the third and final Test of that series, and a further three centuries in 2008.

Having deputised for Michael Vaughan as England captain in 2006, Strauss was appointed on a permanent basis for the 2008–09 tour of the West Indies following Kevin Pietersen&#x27;s resignation. He enjoyed success with three centuries, and retained the captaincy into 2009. Strauss captained the England team to a 2–1 victory in the 2009 Ashes, scoring a series total of 474 runs, more than any other player on either side, including 161 in England&#x27;s first victory in an Ashes Test at Lord&#x27;s in 75 years. He held the record for most catches by a fielder for England – going past Ian Botham and Colin Cowdrey at Lord&#x27;s against South Africa in 2012 – until he was in turn overtaken by Alastair Cook. He relinquished the Test captaincy and retired from all forms of professional cricket on 29 August 2012, following his 100th test, which concluded a series defeat by South Africa that saw the England Test team lose their number-one ranking. He left the job as the second-most successful captain of England in terms of wins, behind only his former opening partner Michael Vaughan. At the end of his retirement press conference he received an unprecedented round of applause from the assembled media.

He became the ECB&#x27;s Director of Cricket in 2015, shortly before the sacking of Peter Moores. As a result of his services to English cricket, Strauss was appointed a Knight Bachelor in Theresa May&#x27;s resignation honours on 10 September 2019.

==Education and early life==
Strauss moved to the UK at the age of six. He was educated at Caldicott School, a boys&#x27; prep school in Buckinghamshire, followed by Radley College, a public boarding school for boys in Oxfordshire.

He studied economics at the University of Durham, and wrote his dissertation on supermodular games. In addition to competing for the university he represented the Hatfield College side, where one of his teammates was the cricket statistician Benedict Bermange. Strauss also competed for the university rugby club as a fly-half, starting in the 3rd XV and soon moving up to the 2nd XV. Graeme Fowler, his coach at the university, was eventually able to convince Strauss to focus exclusively on cricket:

In a rare distinction, he achieved a full Palatinate (an award &quot;given to those who have represented their country whilst at University and have, at the same time, also made a significant contribution to their club&quot;) for his cricketing activities. He graduated in 1998 with an upper-second class BA degree.

==Life and career==
===Personal life===
During his early career, Strauss spent several years in the cities of Sydney and Adelaide in Australia, and briefly played first-grade cricket alongside Australian bowler Brett Lee. While in Australia he met his future wife, actress Ruth McDonald, whom he married in October 2003 and lived in Marlow, with their sons, Sam (born 4 December 2005) and Luca (14 July 2008). On 29 December 2018, Ruth died after a battle with a rare form of lung cancer. In the wake of Ruth&#x27;s death, Andrew reached out to former Ashes adversary Glenn McGrath, who had himself been widowed by cancer after Glenn&#x27;s wife Jane – a native of Paignton, Devon – had died of breast cancer. Following Jane&#x27;s death, Glenn had started the McGrath Foundation to fight breast cancer and secured the Sydney Test as a partner event, with Jane McGrath Day marked as Day 3 and the stumps, player caps and fan clothes all in pink. Having played in one such Pink Test himself in 2011, Strauss along with the Ruth Strauss Foundation secured Day 2 of the Lord&#x27;s Test as a similar partner event ahead of the 2019 Ashes.

Strauss is President of the Primary Club Juniors, a charity which helps fund blind cricket. In aid of the cause he took part in a blind game, wearing a blindfold and being dismissed on his second ball. He has a variety of nicknames ranging from &quot;Straussy&quot;, &quot;Levi&quot; and &quot;Johann&quot;, to the more obscure &quot;Lord Brocket&quot;, &quot;Mareman&quot;, &quot;The General&quot;, &quot;Jazzer&quot;, &quot;Muppet&quot; and &quot;Mr Potato Head&quot;.

Already Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Strauss was promoted to Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours. His alma mater, Durham University, conferred the honorary doctorate of DCL upon him in 2011. In Theresa May&#x27;s resignation honours on 10 September 2019 he was made a Knight Bachelor. Strauss has written several books on his professional career, &quot;Coming Into Play: My Life in Test Cricket&quot; (2006), &quot;Testing Times: In Pursuit of the Ashes&quot; (2010, with Scyld Berry), &quot;Winning the Ashes Down Under: The Captains Story&quot; (2011), and an autobiography, &quot;Driving Ambition&quot;, in 2014. Politically, Strauss is a Conservative, raising money for them in a charity auction. David Cameron tried to persuade Strauss to become an MP in 2013, but Strauss turned down the offer.

===Domestic career===
Having played for the Durham University cricket team and the Middlesex second XI since 1996, Strauss made his Middlesex first XI debut in 1998, scoring 83 in his maiden first-class innings. Despite this, he made a quiet start: he averaged 24 and 30.5 in his first two first-class seasons, and he did not make his maiden first-class century until an innings of 111 not out two years after his debut. Thereafter, Strauss&#x27;s stock rose quickly: his returns in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were 1211 runs at an average of 45, 1202 at 48 and 1529 at 51. He was appointed captain of Middlesex in 2002, following the retirement of Angus Fraser, and retained the post until the end of the 2004 season. In late August 2011, Strauss hit his highest first-class score of 241 not out against Leicestershire, beating his previous best of 177.

Strauss is a Committee Member of Marylebone Cricket Club.

===International career===

====Debut year (2003–04)====
Strauss&#x27;s first taste of international cricket came as part of England&#x27;s tour of the sub-continent, but he would only fulfil the role of the twelfth man; despite considering himself better in the long form of the game, Strauss was surprised to be selected for the One Day squad. Although he was not selected for the main team, Strauss did make an appearance in a tour match, starring with 51 in an opening partnership of 146 in a slow, but fluent innings. As England moved straight from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka, Strauss continued to put pressure on England opener Vikram Solanki in a tour match top scoring with 83, juxtaposed with Solanki&#x27;s five ball duck and was rewarded with his England debut in a disastrous ten-wicket defeat where he was caught and bowled by fellow debutant Dinusha Fernando and was subsequently omitted for the rest of the tour.

Strauss was given another chance in the tour of the West Indies, even being called up to the Test squad owing to the injury of Mark Butcher. Still he was only given a chance in the ODI team, but he made an impact even at his un-native number three position top scoring with 29 in a tense England win. Despite this he was omitted, after the second abandoned match, until the fifth ODI where he contributed only 10 but made up for it joint top scoring with skipper Michael Vaughan and putting on a good start in an ultimately losing match, making a great first international catch. He also contributed 66 to help win the final match, drawing the series.
Strauss returned home to start the 2004 English season but was chosen to make his Test debut for England after Vaughan sustained a knee injury in the nets. The initial plan was to promote Mark Butcher to the vacant opening batsman position and include Paul Collingwood in the middle order. Butcher declined to move up the order and batted third, meaning Strauss was asked to open the batting and Collingwood missed out on a place in the side. Vaughan&#x27;s injury turned out to be fortunate for Strauss who, in his first Test innings, top scored with 112 and contributed 82 in the second innings before being run out, with Nasser Hussain taking responsibility for the dismissal. This put Strauss on a series of exclusive lists including being the second English player to score a century on his debut at Lord&#x27;s, third opener to score a hundred on debut, the fifteenth English player to score a century on his debut, the first since Graham Thorpe in 1993 and only the fourth English player to score a century and half century on his debut. Strauss also made the first dismissal of the Test, catching Stephen Fleming off Simon Jones and was awarded Man of The Match for his efforts. The performance by Strauss excelled his role as a filler for Vaughan, leading to Hussain retiring from cricket allowing for Vaughan to move down the order and Strauss retaining the role of opener opposite Marcus Trescothick. Strauss&#x27; form declined over the series, with one half century in the second Test and his first Test duck along with a six in the third Test.

In the ensuing NatWest tri-series that bridged the two tours, England won only one match, where Strauss guided them home with an unbeaten 44, even losing against the West Indies after a century-each partnership of 226 with Andrew Flintoff at Lord&#x27;s with Strauss recording his first One Day century with an exact 100. Strauss continued to make Lord&#x27;s a talisman as he returned for the opening Test of the series against West Indies with another century opposite Rob Key&#x27;s 221 in a winning effort; the two also set the record for highest second wicket partnership against the West Indies. In the third Test at Old Trafford where Brian Lara scored his ten thousandth run, Strauss faltered after five hours at the crease falling just short of another century at 90. In the final part of a packed 2004 season, Strauss guided England to victory with 44 not out against India in the NatWest Challenge opening One Day match but only scored 2 a piece in the following two matches. Then, in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy at home Strauss contributed towards a win against Zimbabwe and then starred in the semi-final against old enemies Australia with 52 not out from 42. However, along with the rest of the team aside from Trescothick he failed to muster a decent total in the final allowing West Indies to take the trophy.

====Road to The Ashes (2004–05)====
The runners-up in the Champions Trophy took October off before beginning a tour of Africa in November. Their first port of call was Zimbabwe, visiting for the first time since the 2003 World Cup political concerns and despite being minnows Strauss could not muster even a half century in the 4–0 series win. In the final match, Strauss was called on to bowl a single over, conceding three runs. England then moved to Strauss&#x27; native South Africa for a five Test series taking them into the new year. His homecoming was an explosive one as he caught captain Graeme Smith off the second ball and went on to score his first away century with 126 before scoring over half of the team&#x27;s second innings score as he steered them towards victory, again falling short of twin hundreds with 94 not out; still he became only the seventh Test player to record a century on his home and away debut. Despite missing out on this accolade he did record back to back centuries, in the Boxing Day Test he top scored in the first innings with only 25 as it seemed England were set for defeat, Strauss and Trescothick bolstered the side with an opening partnership stand of 273, top scoring with 136 to help England push for victory though it would end in a draw. In the losing, third Test Strauss not only top scored in the first innings with 45, he also became the fourth fastest Englishman to reach 1,000 Test runs in 19 innings. After his third century of the tour in the fourth Test that helped secure the decisive victory Strauss ended with a pair of ducks in the fourth and fifth Test preventing England from extending the lead to 3–1. Despite the two zeroes, Strauss dominated the batsmen of the series making 656 runs over the five matches at an average of 72.88 and earned his first Man of The Series award. In the losing One Day series that followed Strauss failed to impress with the bat, never making more than 35. Nevertheless, his Test success drew the plaudits of, among others, future Australian rival Justin Langer.

After the tour, England returned home to play Bangladesh with Strauss&#x27;s home ground of Lord&#x27;s only helping him towards a half century in the one innings they played. In the following NatWest Series against Bangladesh and Australia, England built on their momentum going into the Ashes series by making their way to the top of the group and into the final. Individually, Strauss posted 82* and 98 in the first and last matches against Bangladesh, with a One Day high score of 152 from 128 balls in the middle match but fared less well against Australia, never scoring more than 25 and only managing 2 in the tied final at Lord&#x27;s. Strauss was significantly shuffled down the order in England&#x27;s inaugural Twenty20 International against Australia and made 18 in their 100 run win and in the losing NatWest Challenge scored favourably, but not notable, with two scores near 50.

====The Ashes (2005)====

Going into the 2005 Ashes series having not won since the 1980s but with an unbeaten series record going back six series it was a highly anticipated series with Australian captain Ricky Ponting predicting it to be the closest Ashes since England&#x27;s last win. Seemingly the pressure affected Strauss even at Lord&#x27;s, along with the rest of the team, as he contributed 2 to their 155 and a slightly more impressive 37 to their 180 in a losing first Test, though Strauss did catch Ponting in the first innings. The second Test proved to be a much more dramatic affair and Strauss improved somewhat on his showing at Lord&#x27;s with an opening stand of 112 opposite Trescothick, falling two short of a half century to the spin of Shane Warne. While this healthy platform pushed England towards a 99 run lead in the first innings, it was Strauss&#x27; paltry second innings of six which garnered more attention: four deliveries before the end of play on day two a Warne legbreak spun prodigiously from the rough across Strauss&#x27; body to knock down leg stump. Those six runs are arguably crucial though, as England&#x27;s winning margin was simply two runs. The number six would follow him into the next Test at Old Trafford, making way for Vaughan to bat the first century of the series. Strauss followed in his captain&#x27;s footsteps in the second innings adding 106 of his own to help set a target of 371 for the Australians who managed to stave off losing their final wicket to secure a draw and maintain a 1–1 series score.

In the fourth Test Strauss helped England to a fine start with a century first wicket partnership, contributing 35 himself and helping restrict Australia to 218 with two catches, specifically fast striker Adam Gilchrist in an exceedingly wide catch at slip which was called &quot;the abiding image of the Summer&quot;. After enforcing the follow-on England were set 129 and the batsmen started falling under pressure, with Strauss lasting until the third wicket down and posting one of four scores within the twenties to help win the Test and take the series lead. With only a draw required in the final Test to take home the Ashes, Strauss showed a winning attitude batting for almost all of the first day, with seven partnerships, to put on 129 and secure another Ashes hundred and make himself the only batsmen on either team to record two centuries in the series. Once again Strauss made a notable catch in the field helping to dismiss captain Ponting again, Australia&#x27;s second best batsman in the series, as well as sending fast bowler Glenn McGrath back to the pavilion for a duck. Unfortunately Strauss could not keep up his sterling performance as England were put back into bat with just over a day left in the series he fell to Warne again, caught by Simon Katich, for a single run. Regardless, the maiden Test century of fellow South African-born England player Kevin Pietersen stalled Australia from taking victory and England won the series 2–1 to take home the Ashes for the first time in 18 years.

In a series arguably dominated more by bowling than batting, Strauss notched up an average of 39.30; and while, with 393 runs, he was only the fourth-highest-scoring batsmen for England, only one Australian, Justin Langer, scored more than him, and by only one run. Strauss was also the only player to score two centuries, and made six catches, the second-highest number for an England fielder, behind Ian Bell. While captain Michael Vaughan and coach Duncan Fletcher were awarded OBEs, the rest of the team, Strauss included, were given MBEs in the New Years Honours list. (Strauss subsequently was awarded the OBE in the 2011 Birthday Honours list.)

====Facing Asian teams and early captaincy (2005–06)====
England toured Pakistan in the winter months that followed, looking to extend their unbeaten streak of six Test series (with only two lost Tests) since 2004. Strauss started the tour nervously, with warm-up scores of two fives and a six, mustering 56 in the final warm-up innings. Despite acknowledging his batting problems, Strauss&#x27; performance never recovered as he scored only 44 runs in the first two Test matches, losing the first and drawing the second, at an average of 11 before he departed Pakistan to attend the birth of his first child, missing England&#x27;s final loss. Strauss returned for the One Day series but showed little improvement with only five runs in the tour match, but found more success shuffled down to third man, top scoring 94 to help England win the first match. He also scored 26 runs in the low scoring, final match which England also won but in between picked up a pair of ducks.

The other side of Christmas, England went to India in March and after Trescothick absented himself owing to stress-related illness, Strauss found himself opening England&#x27;s batting with 21-year-old debutante Alastair Cook. Cook repeated Strauss&#x27; debut theatrics, scoring a half and full century, overshadowing Strauss&#x27;s 28 and 46 in the drawn match. Without Cook opposite him in the third Test, Strauss shone once again with 128 in a winning effort to level the series. In the following One Day matches England would have been lucky to manage a draw, suffering four straight losses under replacement captain Andrew Flintoff since Vaughan&#x27;s knee-injury had prevented him from touring. Strauss&#x27;s only double digit score was 61 in the second match but with Flintoff requiring a break from deputising, Strauss was handed the captaincy for the fifth match which ultimately was abandoned, leading to crowd violence in Guwahati. With Flintoff remaining the twelfth man for the following ODI, Strauss guided England to victory after putting India to bat, with a hundred partnership with Ian Bell totalling 74 before cramp forced him to retire. The emphatic, eight over victory was to be England&#x27;s only One Day success on the tour as the final match saw India chase the runs victoriously with only five balls remaining with Strauss offering only 25.

As England returned home weary from an entire Winter without a series victory after the euphoria of the previous two years, they completed a subcontinental triumvirate when Sri Lanka arrived to prove that Asian dominance was not particular to the Indian subcontinent. With the captaincy crown returned to Flintoff, Strauss could focus solely on his batting prowess at the ground that made him famous. Opening once again with Trescothick, Strauss fell two short of a half century to the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan at the stroke of lunch, allowing Cook to walk out to the wicket afterwards with company. Strauss went on to take the final wicket of Sri Lanka&#x27;s first innings, Nuwan Kulasekara, catching him off Flintoff to allow England to enforce the follow-on which they could not capitalise on, forcing a draw. In the second Test, England took the lead with a victory after Strauss scored the second highest runs in both English innings, being controversially caught for 16 in the second off his pads. He recorded another half century in the third Test, though it was not enough to stave off a 134 run defeat. Once again he was offered the captaincy for the short form game, leading England in a tense, two run loss to Sri Lanka where he put on an opening partnership with Trescothick for 59. Under Strauss&#x27; captaincy England endured a five match whitewash where Strauss failed to muster even fifty though it was acknowledged that the team, particularly the bowling side, were under strength.

Despite the One Day &#x27;whitewash&#x27;, Strauss was given faith and made the official captain, rather than a stand in, for Pakistan&#x27;s Summer tour as England embarked on their busy international schedule leading up to the Ashes and the World Cup. Given the Test captaincy, his first match was at his favourite ground Lord&#x27;s where he recorded another century, 128 this time, in the second innings but came under criticism for allowing his bowlers only 80 overs for victory, which they did not achieve. He turned things round drastically in the second Test with tight fielding that restricted Pakistan to under 250 in both innings while contributing 42 to England&#x27;s high strike rate 461, allowing an emphatic innings victory in just three days. Though the third Test was not quite as emphatic, England still won the Test after restricting the second innings, not allowing any centuries like in the other three innings and scoring one himself, 116, to take an unassailable lead in his first Test series as captain. Strauss&#x27; first Test series as skipper ended in an amount of controversy at The Oval in what some commentators have referred to as Ovalgate when, during their second innings, umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove inspected the ball and decided that it had been tampered with. Insulted by the allegation, the Pakistan team protested by not taking to the field after the tea break leading the umpires to declare the match forfeited. Pakistan later tried to take to the field but the umpires upheld their decision. Two years later the decision was changed to a draw after a petition from Pakistan, but in February 2009 the original decision was reinstated amidst criticism of the precedent such historicism would set. The series thus ended 3–0 to England, with Strauss being awarded Player of The Series due to being the top of England&#x27;s run scorers, behind only to Mohammed Yousuf on either side.

Strauss continues his captaincy with the limited overs team. He performed less well in the one-off Twenty20 International, falling for a duck while Pakistan soared to victory with two overs to spare and his luck remained the same as the One Day series began. After two low scores he scored 50 in the third match though the team would still lose, however his 78 in the fourth match propped up an eight wicket win and a top score of 35 earned England a 2–2 draw in the series. The following month England returned to the sub-continent for the Champions Trophy in India. Strauss scored two half centuries in three matches but the team as a whole played disastrously with only one victory over the West Indies.

====Decline in form (2006–07)====
After the Champions Trophy the captaincy reverted to Andrew Flintoff as soon as he was cleared as being match fit. Strauss started the tour badly, scoring only 71 runs from the first four innings along with a generally terrible display from England. After losing the first two Tests, questions were asked about a divided dressing room owing to the captaincy changing hands so frequently between Strauss and Flintoff but Strauss played down these accusations. He followed this with 88 in a warm-up match but in the following Test he was given out to dubious decisions in both innings, caught for 42 and LBW for a duck, with replays suggesting both decisions were harsh. In the Boxing Day Test Strauss secured his only landmark of the series with an even 50 though he will most likely remembered as Shane Warne&#x27;s 700th Test victim as the Australian spin bowler reached the milestone in his penultimate Test match, by which point the Ashes had been lost. As if the five match whitewash was not enough, the final innings of the series for Strauss was marked with a bouncer to the head from Brett Lee causing him to go to hospital after he was dismissed. After the Test series, coach Duncan Fletcher lamented the lack of confidence in both Strauss and Paul Collingwood whom he had wished to promote as role models for the rest of the team. Despite the decline in his form towards the end of the year, poor umpiring decisions were taken into account and Strauss was picked as part of the 2006 Wisden Forty.

England went from the Test series to a one-off Twenty20 International in warm-up for the Commonwealth Bank Tri-Series. Strauss was omitted from the Twenty20 game but did play for the One Day series. Though England tended to be superior in the long format over the short format, they gained momentum after opening losses and defeated New Zealand in what had become a winner takes all match at the end of the group stages, with Strauss&#x27;s 55 being the only notable score for him in the series. By this point Strauss&#x27;s poor One Day form had been highlighted, with Fletcher admitting he was mostly in the team due to shallow batting options. The half century did nothing for Strauss&#x27;s confidence though as he fell for a duck in the first final and only six in the second, though he did take the prized wickets of Ponting and Mike Hussey, restricting them both to single digit scores helping to manipulate the Duckworth-Lewis effected score so that England could win the match without needing the third game. His poor form saw him omitted from the group stage of the World Cup and despite commentators expecting him to make a return for the Super Eights stage against Sri Lanka he had to wait to meet old enemies Australia to be recalled, where he only made 7 and had a run-out on Ponting turned down after TV replays. He batted with England for the rest of the stage until England were knocked out; he would not play One Day cricket for England again until two years later.

Eventually his poor year in both forms of the international form of the game, even after being allowed only to focus on Tests, saw him dropped from the team after 43 Test matches.

====Omission from team and revival in New Zealand====
Strauss&#x27; poor run of form continued through 2007, averaging a low 27 and failing to score a century with a top score of 96. While he continued to play in Test matches against India and the West Indies, he was dropped from the ODI side. In late 2007, Strauss was not included in the Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka, and Michael Vaughan was selected to take his position as opening batsman. Strauss then announced that he was going to take a break from cricket after what he described as a &quot;long, tiring and immensely frustrating 12 months.&quot; He was, however, able to travel to India as part of the backup squad if he so wished.

Strauss was thus omitted from England cricket fixtures over the winter. He returned to the Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, however made only four in the first warm-up match before hitting his own wicket. Despite what was now over 25 Test innings without a century, Strauss was chosen ahead of Owais Shah (who scored 96 in the same warm-up match) to play in the second warm-up match, sparking speculation that he would have a place in the Test squad for the first match against New Zealand. Strauss was, however, placed in the number three spot on the batting order, leaving Vaughan and Cook to open as they did in Sri Lanka. His batting in the first innings was poor, and he was dismissed for 5. In the second innings, however, he was returned to the position of opener and scored 104* along with Ian Bell.

Strauss continued to play poorly through the first two matches, and was dismissed for a duck in the first innings of the third. In the second innings, however, he reached a century from 226 deliveries, his slowest but his first since August 2006, going on to make his highest score in Test cricket, 177. This innings seemed to help Strauss re-find his spark as in the first part of the English domestic season that followed he scored runs prolifically for Middlesex, smashing a 163 off 130 balls against Surrey in a domestic one day match.

====New Zealand and South Africa tour England====
After his 177, Strauss&#x27;s place in the side was guaranteed for the following series against the same opposition. While still ignored for the One Day International team he was given back his position of Test opener alongside Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan going back down to number 3. In the first rain affected match at Lords he carried on his form with a slow but steady 63 in the only England innings of the match. In the second Test Strauss made another 60 before getting out giving England a decent start following a big first innings total. He then went on to make 106, chasing 294, in the second innings on a now difficult batting wicket which set England up to win by 6 wickets to take a 1–0 lead in the three match series. This was Strauss&#x27;s second Test match century at Old Trafford (the first coming against Australia in 2005, when he also scored 106). In the third and final Test at Trent Bridge he made 37 in England&#x27;s first and only innings as England went on to win the series 2–0. He was named England&#x27;s man of the series for his 266 runs at an average of 66.50.

His form now impressing the selectors, Strauss was allowed to keep his place for the tour against South Africa. He started on an average note being dismissed for 44 in England&#x27;s only innings of the first match. He suffered in the second Test at Headlingly, however, making just 27 runs in the first innings and a duck in the second. A pair of 20s resulted as Strauss continued to struggle against the pace bowling of South Africa in the third Test. With England 2–0 down going into the last Test, a win was needed to restore pride. Strauss failed in the first innings, being dismissed for six. With the bowlers having got England into a match winning position, Strauss then came good, sharing a century opening stand with Cook and eventually being dismissed for 58. Nevertheless, his place remained under pressure again.

====2008 Tour of India====
Strauss managed to keep his place for the India tour and immediately rewarded the selectors by making 123 in the first innings of the first Test match with the rest of the batting lagging behind. He followed it up by holding the batting order together after a collapse that saw England 43–3 and shared a 200 run partnership with Paul Collingwood in which Strauss and Collingwood both made 108. He became just the 10th Englishman to make two hundreds in the same Test match, with Marcus Trescothick being the last in 2004.

====Captaincy====
Strauss was appointed captain on 7 January 2009 after a rift between previous captain Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores became public. Subsequently, Pietersen resigned the captaincy after just 3 Test matches, and Moores was sacked. This came after a rise of form in the 2008 Test Series in India, in which England lost and drew their two games.

In his first match as regular captain, against the West Indies at Sabina Park, Strauss and his team failed, Strauss scoring 7 and 9 as England were bowled out for 51 in the second innings to lose by an innings. After the fiasco of the abandoned Test match, Strauss subsequently had an excellent series with the bat, with scores of 169, 142 and 142 in the remaining three Tests giving him a series aggregate of 541 runs at an average of 67.62, but England were unable to force a victory in any of these three matches and consequently lost the series 1–0. As captain in the subsequent one-day series, which was drawn 2–2, Strauss scored 105 in Guyana and 79 not out from 61 balls at the Kensington Oval. He also captained the Twenty20 side to a six-wicket defeat. Strauss said to the BBC that he hoped that the whole captaincy debacle would be solved in time for the 2009 Ashes Series.

Strauss atoned for the defeat by the West Indies with a 2–0 home victories over the West Indies at home in both the Test and the ODI series. After that series, Strauss had a break from the international circuit while the World Twenty20 was underway. He played two county championship matches to little effect beyond a score of 97 against Essex.

====The Ashes (2009)====
England entered the series hoping to regain the Ashes after a 2007 5–0 whitewash.

In the first Test at Sophia Gardens, Strauss failed to capitalise on two starts, scoring 30 and 17; his second-innings dismissal, caught off a top-edged cut off Nathan Hauritz, was particularly poor. On a good batting wicket Australia racked up 674 for 6 declared, with Simon Katich (122), Ricky Ponting (150), Marcus North (125 not out) and Brad Haddin (121) all scoring centuries. In the second innings, only a dogged 5¾-hour 74 from Paul Collingwood and tail-end contributions salvaged a draw for England, with final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar left to block out the final 11½ overs of the match.

England entered the second Test at Lord&#x27;s having not won an Ashes Test there since Hedley Verity&#x27;s match in the 1934 Ashes. On his domestic home ground, Strauss batted through the entire first day of the match for 161 runs, sharing an opening partnership of 196 with Alastair Cook (95). Though Strauss was bowled by Ben Hilfenhaus&#x27;s second ball the following day without adding to his overnight score, his innings was the highest individual score made by either side during the series, and set up a 210-run first-innings lead. Strauss contributed 32 to England&#x27;s second innings, as Australia were set a target of 522 to win, a record if achieved. Though Michael Clarke (136), Brad Haddin (80) and Mitchell Johnson (63) briefly made the target seem attainable, Andrew Flintoff (5–92) and Graeme Swann (4–87) bowled England to a comfortable 115-run victory.

In the third Test at Edgbaston, Strauss responded to Australia&#x27;s first innings of 263 by ending the second day 64 not out; he was removed by Ben Hilfenhaus the following morning for 69, before England&#x27;s powerful lower-middle order propelled the side to a 113-run first-innings lead. Australia, however, experienced little difficulty in drawing the match, losing only five wickets in one-and-a-half days thanks to Michael Clarke (103 not out) and Marcus North (96).

In the fourth Test at Headingley, Strauss was distracted before the start of play by team selection issues, with Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff both injured, and a back spasm to Matt Prior delaying play by ten minutes as his fitness to play was ascertained. Strauss&#x27; concentration may have been affected by the fire alarm which sounded in the team&#x27;s hotel at 5 am, or by the media interviews he gave immediately before he opened the batting; he was lucky not to be given out lbw to the first ball of the match. and was removed shortly afterwards for three as England collapsed to 102 all out against Peter Siddle and Stuart Clark. More runs for Michael Clarke and Marcus North led Australia to a total of 445. Strauss and Alastair Cook responded with an opening partnership of 58 before Ben Hilfenhaus removed Strauss for 32; England capitulated, this time to Hilfenhaus and Mitchell Johnson en route to an innings defeat.

England therefore entered the fifth Test at the Oval with the series level at 1–1, knowing that only a victory would suffice to bring the Ashes home, as by longstanding convention the Ashes are retained by the current holders in the event of a drawn series. Strauss contributed 55 to England&#x27;s first innings of 332, before Stuart Broad (5–37) and Graeme Swann (4–38) unexpectedly combined to bowl Australia out for 160. In the second innings Strauss scored 75, sharing a 128-run partnership with debutant Jonathan Trott (119) to set Australia a target of 546. On the final day of the series, Strauss produced a sharp piece of fielding from leg slip to run out Michael Clarke for a duck, and also contributed a catch, as Australia were bowled out for 348 to hand England a 197-run victory in the match, a 2–1 victory in the series, and the Ashes.

Strauss was named England&#x27;s man of the series by Australian coach Tim Nielsen; he finished the series with an aggregate of 474 runs (the highest aggregate on either side; no other England player managed more than 261), at an average of 52.66 (no other England player barring Jonathan Trott, who only played in one match, averaged more than 40). Such was Strauss&#x27; dominance with the bat that Australia lost the series despite counting six of the seven leading run-scorers among their number.

During the following seven-match ODI series, Strauss&#x27;s contributions led England&#x27;s batting to the extent that, following the series, Andrew Miller commented on &quot;England&#x27;s guileless middle-order who, for the umpteenth time this summer, treated the loss of Andrew Strauss&#x27;s wicket with the same grief and disorientation that a clutch of baby chicks might greet the devouring of their mother by a fox.&quot; He spearheaded England&#x27;s batting efforts with scores of 12, 47, 63, 63, 35, zero and 47 in the series which spanned 4 September until 20 September. He stated on a number of occasions that, despite his own contributions, he was disenchanted by England&#x27;s poor performances during their 6:1 defeat.

Yet, for his performances in 2009, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC.

====2009–10 and 2010====
Following the Ashes, England played in the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. They beat Sri Lanka and South Africa to unexpectedly reach the semi-finals; however, Strauss only managed a top score of 25. He did not fare much better in the ODI series against South Africa, which England won 2–1. England drew the Test series 1–1, but Strauss passed 50 just once.

After the tour to South Africa, Strauss was controversially rested for the subsequent tour of Bangladesh. In his stead, Alastair Cook was named captain and Michael Carberry selected as a replacement opener (though Jonathan Trott was promoted to opener for the second Test, replacing Carberry). England then won the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 in the West Indies under the leadership of Paul Collingwood.

Strauss returned to the Test team in the home series against Bangladesh. He made two half-centuries as England won the two-match series. Between the Tests and the ODI series, England played Australia in a five-match ODI series (this was due to Bangladesh&#x27;s participation in the 2010 Asia Cup during June). England won the series, with Strauss making half-centuries in the second and third games. When Bangladesh returned for the ODI series, Strauss scored a half-century in the first game and a career-best 154 in the third, in which he shared a stand of 250 with Jonathan Trott who also made a century. England won the three-match series 2–1, and Strauss was named Player of the Series. In the accompanying ODI series, Strauss made 126 in the second match of a five-match series.

A controversial series against Pakistan followed. Strauss struggled for form in the Test series, with just one half-century, as England won 3–1, bowling Pakistan out for three sub-100 scores. He found form in the five-match ODI series though, with a century and two fifties as England won 3–2 in their final series before the 2010-11 Ashes series.

====The Ashes (2010–11)====
Strauss headed to the 2010–11 Ashes series hoping to join Mike Brearley and Len Hutton as the only England captains to win the Ashes both home and away, and the first to win an Ashes series in Australia since Mike Gatting in 1986–7. 
Strauss won the toss on the opening morning at the Gabba (Brisbane) and elected to bat, however was caught at gully for a third-ball duck. England&#x27;s first innings total of 260 was not enough, and Australia built a 221-run first innings lead. Despite the large deficit, England fought back; Strauss and Cook scored 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made his 19th Test hundred, eventually out for 110; stumped for the first time in his Test career. Fellow-opener Cook scored an unbeaten 235 and Jonathan Trott 135, also unbeaten, as England declared at 517–1. Australia scored 107–1 in their second innings before a draw was declared.

In the second test match at the Adelaide Oval, Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat but Strauss&#x27; bowlers skittled the Aussies for 245, thanks to James Anderson&#x27;s 4–51 . England then made 620–5 before declaring but Strauss was out for 1 in that innings. England then bowled Australia out again for 304, with Graeme Swann taking 5–91 and England winning by an innings and 71 runs.

In the third test match at Perth, Strauss won the toss and chose to bowl first. England bowled Australia out for 268 on day one and Strauss scored 12* to guide England to 29–0 at stumps. Strauss started well and guided England to 78–0 within the first hour of the day&#x27;s play but a batting collapse saw England bowled out for 187, thanks to Mitchell Johnson&#x27;s 6–38. England struck back and took three Aussie wickets but Australia got to stumps on day two on 119–3. Strauss&#x27; team then bowled the Aussies out for 309, meaning England required 391 to win but batted poorly to be bowled out for just 123, with Ryan Harris taking 6–49 and England losing by 267 runs.

Strauss won the toss at the MCG and elected to bowl on the Boxing Day Test. The decision was an inspired one as England bowled Australia out for 98. In reply, Strauss and Cook had made a 159-run opening stand with Strauss passing 6,000 Test runs before being caught for 69. After England made 513, they bowled Australia out for 258 to win by an innings and 157 runs, therefore retaining the Ashes.

In the fifth and final Test at the SCG in Sydney, Strauss lost the toss and Michael Clarke, Australian captain in the absence of the injured Ponting, elected to bat. England bowled Australia out for 280. In reply, Strauss made 60 from just 58 balls before being bowled by Ben Hilfenhaus. England continued to make a score of 644 their highest score on Australian soil, thanks to centuries from Alastair Cook, Ian Bell and Matt Prior. Australia fell for 281 in their second innings, handing England a third win by an innings in the series, and an overall 3–1 Ashes victory.

====2011 World Cup====

In England&#x27;s opening match of the ICC World cup 2011 against Netherlands, Andrew Strauss hit a better than run-a-ball 88 to get England off to a good start and help them clinch a 6 wicket victory. He maintained this good form the next game, scoring an impressive 158 off 145 chasing an imposing 339 which hosts India had set them. The match ended in a thrilling tie.
The third game saw Strauss score 34 off 37 balls as scored 327 against Ireland, but England nonetheless suffered a shock defeat, thanks to a 50-ball 100 by Kevin O&#x27;Brien and a 162-run partnership for the 6th wicket.
England then won a thrilling match against South Africa on 6 March, bowling their opponents out for 165 in Chennai to defend a low score of 171, with Stuart Broad claiming 4 vital wickets. The English bowlers derailed the strong Proteas batting lineup, which collapsed from 63 for no loss and lost all their wickets for 102 runs. However, the group stage ended in another shock defeat, this time to Bangladesh, and although England qualified for the quarter-finals, they were comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka. Strauss duly stepped down from the ODI captaincy and retired from One Day International Cricket.

====Retirement====
Strauss announced his retirement from cricket on 29 August 2012 after 100 test appearances. As a token of appreciation, his teammates bought him 100 bottles of wine, of which he said &quot;I think that will furnish me nicely into retirement!&quot; Alastair Cook, his vice-captain and opening partner, was named as his successor. Cook had previously captained England in test matches, as well as being the current ODI captain.

===Management===
In April 2015, a reorganisation at the ECB saw Paul Downton&#x27;s role of managing director made redundant. Strauss was appointed to the newly created role of director of England cricket in May 2015 and his first act was to sack the incumbent coach Peter Moores. Another early move was to rule out an imminent return to the England team for Kevin Pietersen, who had fallen out with the previous management team. He oversaw the appointment of Trevor Bayliss as coach, and encouraged a greater emphasis to be given to limited overs cricket. Strauss resigned his position on 3 October 2018, citing a wish to spend more time with his wife, Ruth, while she was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. She died on 29 December that year, aged 46.

<doc id="670091" wikidata="Q1747117" url="?curid=670091" title="List of English words of Hungarian origin">
<text>This is a partial list of known or supposed Hungarian loanwords in English:

; biro: From &quot;László Bíró&quot;, the Hungarian inventor of the ballpoint pen. Bíró originally means judge.
; coach: From &quot;kocsi&quot;, a horse‐drawn wagon with springs above the axles. Named after the village of Kocs in which this type of vehicle was invented. The verb &#x27;to coach&#x27; is also derived from this root.
; czardas: From &quot;csárdás,&quot; a Hungarian folk dance. &quot;Csárda&quot; also means &#x27;tavern&#x27;.
; Dobos torte or Dobosh: From &quot;Dobos torta&quot;, &quot;Dobos cake&quot;. After confectioner József C. Dobos. Dobos originally means drummer.
; fogas: an Eastern European species of fish &quot;(Sander lucioperca),&quot; cf. zander.
; forint: the currency of Hungary since 1946 (also between 1325-1553 and 1750–1892). Originally derived from Italian &quot;fiorino,&quot; name of the Florentine currency. Cognate with English &quot;florin&quot; (see also pengő).
; friska: From &quot;friss&quot;, a fast section of music, often associated with &quot;czardas&quot; dances (&quot;cf.&quot; lassan). But the Hungarian &quot;friss&quot; comes from the German &quot;frisch,&quot; in general with the same meaning (&quot;fresh&quot;).
; goulash: From &quot;gulyás,&quot; a type of stew known in Hungarian as &quot;gulyás&quot;. In Hungary, &#x27;gulyásleves&#x27; is a soup dish; leves meaning soup. &quot;Gulyás&quot; also means &#x27;herdsman&#x27; dealing with cattle, as the noun &quot;gulya&quot; is the Hungarian word for cattle herd. (This can cause confusion with native Hungarian speakers, as Hungarians generally understand unqualified &quot;gulyás&quot; to mean &quot;gulyásleves&quot;, the soup, instead of referring to the international &quot;goulash&quot; as &quot;pörkölt&quot;.)
; hajduk: From &quot;hajdúk&quot;, &quot;bandits&quot; (plural of &quot;hajdú&quot;). Outlaw, guerilla fighter. The original Hungarian meaning was &quot;cattle drover&quot;.
; halászlé: or Fisherman&#x27;s Soup, a hot and spicy river fish soup with much paprika. (The actual Hungarian &quot;halászlé&quot; is not always made with hot paprika, unlike the internationally known soup.)
; hussar: From Hungarian &quot;huszár,&quot; a light cavalry soldier. The Hungarian word originally meant &quot;freebooter&quot; and was further derived via Old Serbian &quot;husar, gusar, gursar&quot; (&quot;pirate&quot;) from Italian &quot;corsaro&quot; (&quot;pirate&quot;), i.e. the same root as that of English &quot;corsair&quot;.
; : is sometimes linked to Hungarian &quot;ici-pici&quot; (&quot;tiny&quot;) by popular sources, but is regarded as an unrelated English formation by English dictionaries.
; komondor: A big Hungarian breed of livestock guardian dog, looking like a big mop, always white.
; kuvasz: A big Hungarian breed of shepherd dog, always white.
; lassan: From &quot;lassú&quot;, &quot;slowly&quot;. a slow section of music, often associated with &quot;czardas&quot; dances (&quot;cf.&quot; friska).
; paprika: a spice produced from the ground, dried fruits of &quot;Capsicum annuum&quot;, a red pepper. Paprika in English refers to a powdered spice made of dried Capsicum of several sorts, though in Hungary it is the name of the fruit as well.
; pengő: the currency of Hungary between 1925 and 1946 (cf. forint).
; puli: A small Hungarian breed of shepherd dog, also looking like a mop, usually black or white.
; pusta or &quot;puszta&quot;: From &quot;puszta&quot;, a kind of Hungarian steppe.
; rezbanyite: a mineral (consisting of lead, copper, and bismuth sulfide), named after Rézbánya (&quot;copper mine&quot;)
; sabre (UK) or saber (US): From French (&quot;sabre&quot;, &quot;sable&quot;), ultimately from an unknown source in a language of Eastern origin, possibly through Hungarian &quot;szablya&quot;.

<text>In Mande mythology, Faro purified the earth by sacrificing himself to atone for his twin Pemba&#x27;s sin.

In the ancient myth, two forces, Dya and Gla, gave rise to Faro and Pemba, embodiments of the sky and earth, respectively. Faro, a symbol of femininity and creation, was accompanied by her male counterpart, Koni, who derived his existence from her.

A pivotal event occurred when Faro&#x27;s pond overflowed, causing a devastating flood. Seeking refuge, Faro, her followers, and animals boarded an ark, enduring seven days of tumultuous weather until the storm subsided. Emerging from the ark, Faro and a blacksmith companion initiated the founding of a village.

Under Faro&#x27;s guidance, the village flourished with the cultivation of crops from seeds she provided. She also bestowed life upon animals and orchestrated the rhythms of day and night, as well as the changing seasons. Faro&#x27;s crowning achievement was the creation of the Niger River, ensuring sustenance and vitality for all life.

Thus, through Faro&#x27;s nurturing and leadership, the village thrived, symbolizing the enduring power of creation and harmony.

<doc id="670103" wikidata="Q872887" url="?curid=670103" title="Henri Berger">
<text>Henry or Henri Berger (August 4, 1844 – October 14, 1929) was a Prussian Kapellmeister, composer and royal bandmaster of the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1872 to 1915.

== Biography ==
Berger was born Heinrich August Wilhelm Berger in Berlin, and became a first-rate musician as a member of the army band in the 2nd Foot Guards of the Prussian Army. He played in the orchestras of Johann Strauss, Jr. across Europe. 

Originally, Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany loaned Berger from his Potsdam station to King Kamehameha V to conduct the king&#x27;s band. He arrived in Honolulu in June 1872, fresh from service in the Franco-Prussian War. In 1877, King Kalākaua appointed Berger to full leadership of the Royal Hawaiian Band. In 1879, he became a naturalized citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii.

Berger befriended the future Queen Liliʻuokalani, a composer in her own right. Berger arranged the songs she wrote, performed by the brass band. On August 4, 1881, while traveling the world, King Kalākaua reported in a letter from Berlin to Regent Liliʻuokalani, that he had met the mother and sister of Berger and announced the sending of a program whose pieces Berger was to play with the &quot;Royal Hawaiian Band&quot; upon his return. The queen named Berger the &quot;Father of Hawaiian Music&quot;. From 1893 to 1903, the bandmaster worked with the Kamehameha Schools to develop its music program. He also built what is today the Honolulu Symphony.

He led the government band at thousands of public events. Among these were &quot;steamer day,&quot; when a ship left the Honolulu docks. The band serenaded the departees with &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; or &quot;The Girl I Left Behind Me.&quot;

Later in his tenure as royal bandmaster, Berger took it upon himself to record traditional Hawaiian hymns, chants and other Hawaiian music in print to ensure their survival, a task never done before. Berger at the same time composed the classics: &quot;The Hula March&quot;, &quot;Hilo March&quot;, &quot;Kohala March&quot;, “Huki March”, “Ka Mo’i March” and &quot;Sweet Lei Lehua.&quot; His arrangement of &quot;Hawaii Ponoī&quot;, with text by Kalākaua in honor of Kamehameha became the national anthem. Today, the song serves as the state anthem.

Berger combined German, Austrian and Hawaiian traditions in his unique compositions and performed with the Royal Hawaiian Band thousands of times, making Hawaiian music known and popular in many countries. Berger started the RHB &#x27;Aloha&quot; welcome and farewell greetings at the harbors.
He died in Honolulu. His resting-place is the Kawaiahaʻo Church Cemetery.

Robert Louis Stevenson mentioned Berger in his novel &quot;The Bottle Imp&quot;.

Berger&#x27;s legacy continues today, celebrated worldwide especially in Hawaii and Germany, as the father of the Royal Hawaiian Band, the oldest municipal band in the United States.

<doc id="670104" wikidata="Q1060609" url="?curid=670104" title="Mark Thompson (media executive)">
<text>Sir Mark John Thompson (born 31 July 1957) is a British–American media executive who is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ancestry, the largest for-profit genealogy company in the world, and Chief Executive Officer of the Cable News Network (CNN). He is the former president and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company. From 2004 to 2012, he was Director-General of the BBC, and before that was the Chief Executive of Channel 4. In 2009 Thompson was ranked as the 65th most powerful person in the world by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017.

== Early life ==
Thompson was born in London, England, and brought up in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, by his parents, Sydney ( Corduff) and Duncan John Thompson. Sydney was Irish, the daughter of a County Donegal policeman Garda Síochána. Mark Thompson has a sister, Katherine. Duncan Thompson was an accountant from Preston who died when Mark was twelve after suffering from chronic illness and depression.

Mark Thompson was educated by Jesuits at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, and then went to Merton College, Oxford where he took a first in English. He edited the university magazine, &quot;Isis&quot;.

== Early career ==

Thompson first joined the BBC as a production trainee in 1979. His career at the corporation included a number of roles.

In 1981, he assisted in the launch of the long-running consumer programme &quot;Watchdog.&quot; Two years later he was part of the team that created British television&#x27;s first national breakfast television programme, &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. In 1985, Thompson became the Output Editor of &quot;Newsnight&quot; and in 1988, at the age of 30, he was promoted to Editor of the &quot;Nine O&#x27;Clock News&quot;.

In 1990, he became Editor of &quot;Panorama.&quot; He was made Head of Features in 1992 and Head of Factual Programmes in 1994.

In 1996, Thompson succeeded Michael Jackson as Controller of BBC2. He commissioned series including &quot;The Cops&quot;, &quot;The Royle Family&quot;, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; and &quot;The Fast Show&quot;. He left BBC Two in 1999 and was replaced by Jane Root, who became the channel&#x27;s first female Controller.

In 1999 Thompson was named Director, National and Regional Broadcasting at the BBC. He became the BBC Director of Television in 2000, but left the corporation in March 2002 to become Chief Executive of Channel 4. He succeeded Michael Jackson in the role, and left in 2004 to be succeeded by Andy Duncan.

== Director-General of the BBC ==

=== Appointment ===

Thompson was appointed Director-General of the BBC on 21 May 2004. He succeeded Greg Dyke, who resigned on 29 January 2004 in the aftermath of the Hutton Inquiry. Although he had originally stated he was not interested in the role of Director-General and would turn down any approach from the BBC, he changed his mind, saying the job was a &quot;one-of-a-kind opportunity&quot;. The decision to appoint Thompson Director-General was made unanimously by the BBC Board of Governors, headed by the then new Chairman Michael Grade (another former chief executive of Channel 4). His appointment was widely praised: Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell, Shadow Culture Secretary Julie Kirkbride and Greg Dyke were amongst those who supported his selection. He took up the role of Director-General on 22 June 2004 (Mark Byford had been Acting Director-General since Dyke&#x27;s resignation). On his first day he announced several management changes, including the replacement of the BBC&#x27;s sixteen-person executive committee with a slimmed-down executive board of nine top managers.

=== Editorial guideline breaches ===

In 2007 it emerged that the BBC had been involved in a number of editorial guideline breaches: competitions on BBC shows had used fake winners who were either members of the production team or fictitious. In addition, a sequence of clips featuring the Queen and photographer Annie Leibovitz were shown out of order in a trailer for a documentary, giving the impression the Queen stormed off in a huff about her outfit after a conversation with Leibovitz.

Thompson, as BBC editor-in-chief, investigated the breaches, and presented his interim report to the BBC Trust on 18 July 2007. The Trust felt that the BBC&#x27;s values of accuracy and honesty had been compromised, and Thompson outlined to the Trust the actions he would take to restore confidence.

Later that day he told BBC staff, via an internal televised message, that deception of the public was never acceptable. He said that he, himself, had never deceived the public – it would never have occurred to him to do so, and that he was sure that the same applied to the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of BBC staff. He also spoke on BBC News 24 and was interviewed by Gavin Esler for &quot;Newsnight&quot;. He stated that &quot;from now on, if it [deceiving the public] happens we will show people the door.&quot; Staff were emailed on 19 July 2007 and later in the year all staff, including the Director-General, undertook a Safeguarding Trust course.

=== &quot;The Russell Brand Show&quot; prank telephone calls row ===

In October 2008, Thompson had to cut short a family holiday to return to Britain to deal with the arrival of &quot;The Russell Brand Show&quot; prank telephone calls row. Thompson took the executive decision to suspend the BBC&#x27;s highest paid presenter, Jonathan Ross, from all his BBC work for three months without pay. He also said it was the controversial star&#x27;s last warning. Thompson reiterated the BBC&#x27;s commitment to Ross&#x27; style of &quot;edgy comedy&quot;, arguing that &quot;BBC audiences accept that, in comedy, performers attempt to push the line of taste&quot;. Thompson had previously defended the star&#x27;s conduct and salary in 2006, when he described Ross as &quot;outstanding&quot; and said that &quot;the very best people&quot; deserved appropriately high salaries.

=== Comments on political bias ===

In September 2010, Thompson acknowledged some of the BBC&#x27;s previous political bias, which he said he had witnessed early in his career. He stated: &quot;In the BBC I joined 30 years ago there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people&#x27;s personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left&quot;. He added: &quot;the organisation did struggle then with impartiality&quot;.

=== &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot; blasphemy allegations ===
Thompson was criticised by religious groups in relation to the broadcast of &quot;Jerry Springer: The Opera&quot;, with a private prosecution brought against the BBC for blasphemy. Lord Pannick QC appeared and won the case. The High Court ruled that the cult musical was not blasphemous, and Pannick stated that Judge Tubbs had &quot;acted within her powers and made the only decision she could lawfully have made; while religious beliefs were integral to British society, so is freedom of expression, especially to matters of social and moral importance.&quot;

=== Accusations of pro-Israeli editorial stance ===
A number of commentators have suggested that Thompson has a pro-Israeli editorial stance, particularly since he supported the controversial decision by the BBC not to broadcast the DEC Gaza appeal in January 2009. Complaints to the BBC about the decision, numbering nearly 16,000, were directed to a statement by Thompson. In May 2011, Thompson ordered the lyrics &#x27;free Palestine&#x27; in a rap on BBC Radio 1Xtra to be censored. During a meeting of the British Parliament&#x27;s Culture and Media Committee in June 2012, Thompson also issued an apology for not devoting more coverage to the murders of an Israeli settler family in the West Bank, saying the &quot;network got it wrong&quot; – despite the fact that the incident occurred on the same day as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

Tam Dean Burn wrote in &quot;The Herald&quot;: &quot;I would argue that this bias has moved on apace since Thompson went to Israel in 2005 and signed a deal with prime minister Ariel Sharon on the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the conflict.&quot;

=== Nick Griffin &quot;Question Time&quot; appearance ===
In October 2009, Thompson defended the decision by the BBC to invite British National Party leader Nick Griffin to appear on the &quot;Question Time&quot; programme following criticism by Labour politicians including Home Secretary Alan Johnson and Secretary of State for Wales Peter Hain. The decision also led to protests outside BBC Television Centre by UAF campaigners. Thompson said:

It is a straightforward matter of fact that... the BNP has demonstrated a level of support which would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on &quot;Question Time&quot;. It is for that reason alone... that the invitation has been extended. The case against inviting the BNP to appear on &quot;Question Time&quot; is a case for censorship... Democratic societies sometimes do decide that some parties and organisations are beyond the pale. As a result, they proscribe them and/or ban them from the airwaves. My point is simply that the drastic steps of proscription and censorship can only be taken by government and parliament... It is unreasonable and inconsistent to take the position that a party like the BNP is acceptable enough for the public to vote for, but not acceptable enough to appear on democratic platforms like &quot;Question Time&quot;. If there is a case for censorship, it should be debated and decided in parliament. Political censorship cannot be outsourced to the BBC or anyone else.

=== Earning controversy ===
In 2010, Thompson was identified as the highest paid employee of any public sector organisation in the UK, earning between £800,000 and £900,000 per year. In January 2010, Thompson was criticised over his apparent £834,000 salary by BBC presenter Stephen Sackur, who told him &quot;there are huge numbers of people in the organisation who think your salary is plain wrong and corrosive.&quot;

=== Formula One broadcast rights ===
Thompson was Director-General of the BBC when on 29 July 2011 it was announced that the corporation would no longer televise all Formula One Grand Prix live, instead agreeing to split the broadcast between the BBC and Sky Sports. This prompted an outcry from several thousand fans and a motion on the UK Government e-petition site. On 2 September 2011, Thompson and several &quot;senior BBC figures&quot; were called upon by the House of Commons to answer questions over the exact nature of the broadcast arrangement.

=== Jimmy Savile controversy ===
Although Thompson departed the BBC before public exposure of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal and is not noted in the BBC chronology of the unfolding coverage, Thompson faced questions about his role in the events around Savile&#x27;s actions and BBC coverage of them. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Thompson denied knowing of a BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme on accusations against Savile before it was became public knowledge soon after Savile&#x27;s death in October 2011.

=== Praise and criticism of his BBC leadership ===
Thompson left the BBC in September 2012 after eight years as Director-General. &quot;The Independent&quot; said the BBC was in &quot;apparent great shape&quot; with his departure and the BBC Trust&#x27;s chairman, Chris Patten, described his directorship as &quot;outstanding&quot;.

In late 2007, Richard Eyre, former artistic director of the National Theatre, accused the BBC under Thompson&#x27;s leadership of failing to produce programmes &quot;that inspired viewers to visit galleries, museums or theatres&quot;. Tony Palmer, a multi-award-winning filmmaker, stated that the BBC &quot;has a worldwide reputation which it has abrogated and that&#x27;s shameful&quot;. He concluded, &quot;In the end, the buck stops with Mark Thompson. He is a catastrophe.&quot; In May 2008, fertility expert and BBC presenter Robert Winston accused Thompson&#x27;s leadership of showing &quot;cowardice&quot;, and following Thompson&#x27;s departure he accused the corporation of &quot;dumbing down&quot; its science programming and &quot;pursuing viewing figures&quot; rather than producing quality programmes.

== President and CEO of The New York Times Company ==

On 14 August 2012, Thompson was named CEO of The New York Times Company, effective 12 November 2012. He was brought on to accelerate the company&#x27;s digital transition and extend its global reach, and in this role he directs strategy and oversees business operations. Thompson invested heavily in the Times&#x27; digital products, and has attributed increased autonomy for the digital product teams as &quot;the single biggest reason&quot; for the news outlet&#x27;s success.

In 2013, he hired Meredith Kopit Levien as chief revenue officer and promoted her to chief operating officer in 2017. Thompson has been critical of Google and Facebook. He has said the Times seeks to be a destination and not reliant on the platforms, and hopes to &quot;more reliably turn engagement into a regular revenue stream&quot;. In 2018, he gave a speech at the Open Markets Institute in Washington, D.C., in which he described Facebook&#x27;s policy of labeling political news as ads as &quot;a threat to democracy&quot;. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Thompson&#x27;s total compensation in 2019 was $6.1 million, including salary and stock awards.

In 2015, he pledged to transform the Times into an &quot;international institution&quot;, the same way &quot;we once successfully turned a metro paper into a national one&quot;. The Times now has more international digital subscribers than it had total digital subscribers when Thompson took over as CEO. Under Thompson&#x27;s leadership, &quot;The New York Times&quot; became the first news organization in the world to pass the one million digital-only subscription mark. As of May 2020, the company surpassed 5 million digital-only subscriptions, and 6 million total subscriptions, accounting for nearly sixty per cent of the company&#x27;s revenue. In 2015, Thompson set the goal of doubling the company&#x27;s digital revenue by 2020. The goal was met ahead of schedule in 2019. The company&#x27;s new goal is to have 10 million subscriptions by 2025. He has also predicted that the print paper will last for at least 15 more years.

In July 2020, he was replaced by Meredith Kopit Levien as CEO and president of the New York Times Company.

== Chairman of Ancestry ==

In January 2021, Thompson was appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ancestry.

== CEO of CNN ==

On 30 August 2023, Thompson was named the CEO of CNN, replacing Chris Licht, who was fired in June. He officially started on 9 October 2023. Writing of the appointment in a note to staff, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav shared, &quot;I am confident he is exactly the leader we need to take the helm of CNN at this pivotal time.&quot;

===Criticism of coverage of the Israel-Hamas War===
In a 4 February 2024 investigation by The Guardian, some CNN staff blamed their channel&#x27;s newly appointed director Mark Thompson for what they described as biased reporting of the Israel–Hamas war. The staff criticized their network&#x27;s coverage of the war, charging that it had promoted Israeli propaganda, and gave more attention to Israeli suffering, and the Israeli narrative of the war. One staffer claimed that this bias was systematic and institutionalized, as many journalists&#x27; stories were forced to be cleared by channel&#x27;s Jerusalem bureau before publication. Staffers claimed that statements by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority were rarely reported on, while Israeli statements were taken at face value. A CNN spokesperson denied the charges of bias.

== &quot;Enough Said&quot; ==
In 2016, Thompson published &quot;Enough Said: What&#x27;s Gone Wrong with the Language of Politics?&quot; in which he condemns political discourse that is &quot;just a fight to the political death, a fight in which every linguistic weapon is fair game&quot; and is critical of the rejection of science and expertise, writing that this has disastrous policymaking consequences. Thompson also criticised false balance in news reporting. The book was favorably reviewed by Andrew Rawnsley, who called it an &quot;important study&quot; that &quot;identifies many culprits for the destructiveness of political debate.&quot; John Lloyd, writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, praised the work as reflective and an &quot;intricately but also urgently argued book.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the book shows that Thompson &quot;believes devoutly in the importance ... of intelligent and productive public discussion&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Thompson is a Roman Catholic, and was educated at the English Jesuit public school, Stonyhurst College, from 1970 to 1975. In 2010, &quot;The Tablet&quot; named him as one of Britain&#x27;s most influential Roman Catholics. Thompson lives in the United States with his wife, Jane Blumberg (daughter of Baruch Samuel Blumberg) whom he married in 1987. They have two sons and one daughter.

He is a member of the Reform Club and a patron of the Art Room charity in Oxford. In 2002, he joined the board of trustees of Media Trust, the UK&#x27;s leading communications charity.

Thompson has been on the board of directors for The New York Times Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company.

In September 2021, it was announced that Thompson would co-chair, with Filipino journalist and editor Maria Ressa, the International Fund for Public Interest Media.

In 2011, Thompson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Edge Hill University, and 2015, he was awarded a Honorary Doctor of Letters from Sacred Heart University.

In 2012, Thompson was the first Humanitas Visiting Professor in Rhetoric and the Art of Public Persuasion at the University of Oxford.

Thompson was knighted in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to media.

<text>The Ai (; Douay–Rheims: Hai) was a city in Canaan, mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. According to the Book of Joshua, it was conquered by the Israelites, headed by Joshua, during their conquest of Canaan.

The Ai&#x27;s ruins are commonly thought to be in the modern-day archeological site of Et-Tell. Excavations revealed a large urban settlement dating back to around 3100 BC, with cycles of destruction and rebuilding until roughly 2400 BC. It remained uninhabited until a small village emerged in the Early Iron Age. In light of these findings, scholars interpret the biblical account of Ai&#x27;s conquest as an etiological story explaining the origin of the place name.

==Biblical narrative==

According to Genesis, Abraham built an altar between Bethel and Ai.

In the Book of Joshua, chapters 7 and 8, the Israelites attempt to conquer Ai on two occasions. The first, in Joshua 7, fails. The biblical account portrays the failure as being due to a prior sin of Achan, for which he is stoned to death by the Israelites. On the second attempt, in Joshua 8, Joshua, who is identified by the narrative as the leader of the Israelites, receives instruction from God. God tells them to set up an ambush and Joshua does what God says. An ambush is arranged at the rear of the city on the western side. Joshua is with a group of soldiers that approach the city from the front so the men of Ai, thinking they will have another easy victory, chase Joshua and the fighting men from the entrance of the city to lead the men of Ai away from the city. Then the fighting men to the rear enter the city and set it on fire. When the city is captured, 12,000 men and women are killed, and it is razed to the ground. The king is captured and hanged on a tree until the evening. His body is then placed at the city gates and stones are placed on top of his body. The Israelites then burn Ai completely and &quot;made it a permanent heap of ruins.&quot; God told them they could take the livestock as plunder and they did so.

In a study from 2017, Shai Elam compared the Battle of Cannae to the Battle of Ai (which preceded it by about 1,000 years) according to the Malbim&#x27;s interpretation of the book of Joshua, which proves that in the Battle of Ai Joshua also surrounded the enemy&#x27;s army with a perfect ring (which explains the role of the two ambushers and their position during the battle), in a performance that does not fall short of Hannibal&#x27;s tactics.

==Possible locations==
===Et-Tell===
Edward Robinson (1794–1863), who identified many biblical sites in the Levant on the basis of local place names and basic topography, suggested that &quot;Et-Tell&quot; or &quot;Khirbet Haijah&quot; were likely on philological grounds; he preferred the former as there were visible ruins at that site. A further point in its favour is the fact that the Hebrew name &quot;Ai&quot; means more or less the same as the modern Arabic name &quot;et-Tell&quot;.

Up through the 1920s a &quot;positivist&quot; reading of the archeology to date was prevalent—a belief that archeology would prove, and was proving, the historicity of the Exodus and Conquest narratives that dated the Exodus in 1440 BC and Joshua&#x27;s conquest of Canaan around 1400 BC. And accordingly, on the basis of excavations in the 1920s the American scholar William Foxwell Albright believed that Et-Tell was Ai.

However, excavations at Et-Tell in the 1930s, undertaken by Judith Marquet-Krause, found that there was a fortified city there during the Early Bronze Age, between 3100 and 2400 BC, after which it was destroyed and abandoned. The excavations found no evidence of settlement in the Middle or Late Bronze Ages. These findings, along with excavations at Bethel, posed problems for the dating that Albright and others had proposed, and some scholars including Martin Noth began proposing that the Conquest had never happened but instead was an etiological myth; the name meant &quot;the ruin&quot; and the Conquest story simply explained the already-ancient destruction of the Early Bronze city. Archeologists also found that the later Iron Age I village appeared with no evidence of initial conquest, and the Iron I settlers seem to have peacefully built their village on the forsaken mound, without meeting resistance.

Five main hypotheses exist about how to explain the biblical story surrounding Ai in light of archaeological evidence. The first is that the story was created later on: Israelites related it to Joshua because of the fame of his great conquest. The second is that people of Bethel inhabited Ai during the time of the biblical story and they were the ones who were invaded. In a third, Albright combined these two theories to present a hypothesis that the story of the Conquest of Bethel, which was only a mile and a half away from Ai, was later transferred to Ai in order to explain the city and why it was in ruins. Support for this position can be found in the Bible, the assumption being that the Bible does not mention the actual capture of Bethel, but might speak of it in memory in Judges 1:22–26. Fourth, Callaway has proposed that the city somehow angered the Egyptians (perhaps by rebelling, and attempting to gain independence), and so they destroyed it as punishment. The fifth is that Joshua&#x27;s Ai is not to be found at et-Tell, but a different location entirely.

Koert van Bekkum writes that &quot;Et-Tell, identified by most scholars with the city of Ai, was not settled between the Early Bronze and Iron Age I.

This list&#x27;s taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of &quot;The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World&quot;, 2022 edition.

The following tags have been used to highlight several categories. Not all species will fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species.

*(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Gambia
*(I) Introduced - a species introduced to the Gambia as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions
*(Ex) Extirpated - a species that no longer occurs in the Gambia although populations exist elsewhere

<text>Hayk (, ), also known as Hayk Nahapet (, , ), is the legendary patriarch and founder of the Armenian nation. His story is told in the &quot;History of Armenia&quot; attributed to the Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi and in the &quot;Primary History&quot; traditionally attributed to Sebeos. Fragments of the legend of Hayk are also preserved in the works of other authors, as well as in Armenian folk tradition.

== Etymology ==

The name of the patriarch, &quot;Hayk&quot; (), is not exactly homophonous with the Armenian name for &quot;Armenia,&quot; &quot;Haykʻ&quot; (). In Classical Armenian, &quot;Haykʻ&quot; is the nominative plural of &quot;hay&quot; (), the Armenian word for &quot;Armenian.&quot; While Robert W. Thomson considers the etymology of &quot;Haykʻ&quot; (Հայք) from &quot;Hayk&quot; (Հայկ) to be impossible, other scholars consider the connection between the two to be obvious and derive &quot;Hayk&quot; from &quot;hay&quot;/&quot;Haykʻ&quot; via the suffix &quot;-ik&quot;. Armen Petrosyan proposes a possible connection between the name Hayk and the Proto-Indo-European &quot;*poti-&quot; &quot;master, lord, master of the house, husband.&quot; Armenian historiography of the Soviet era connected &quot;Hayk&quot; and &quot;hay&quot; with Hayasa, a people mentioned in Hittite inscriptions. Some authors derive &quot;Hayk&quot; and &quot;hay&quot; from Khaldi/Ḫaldi, the chief god of the Urartian pantheon, and also identify Hayk with the Urartian deity.

The Armenian word &quot;haykakan&quot; (, &#x27;that which pertains to Armenians&#x27;) derives from the name &quot;Hayk&quot;. Additionally, the poetic names for the Armenian nation, &quot;Haykazun&quot; (հայկազուն) or &quot;Haykazn&quot; (հայկազն, consisting of &quot;Hayk&quot; and &quot;azn&quot; &#x27;generation, nation, tribe&#x27;), also derive from Hayk (&quot;Haykazn&quot;/&quot;Haykaz&quot; later became a masculine given name among Armenians).

== Genealogy ==

Integrating the Armenian tradition into biblical tradition, Movses Khorenatsi describes Hayk as a descendant of Noah through the latter&#x27;s son Japheth: &quot;Yapheth begat Gamer [Gomer]; Gamer begat T‘iras; T‘iras begat T‘orgom [Togarmah]; T‘orgom begat Hayk.&quot; Hayk&#x27;s descendants through his son Aramaneak (Aramanyak) are listed as follows: &quot;Aramaneak begat Aramayis; Aramayis begat Amasya; Amasya begat Gełam [Gegham]; Gełam begat Harmay [Harma]; Harmay begat Aram; Aram begat Ara the Handsome.&quot; Hayk&#x27;s other sons, according to Moses, were Khoṛ and Manavaz. Moses also gives the names of numerous other descendants of Hayk (s, &quot;of Hayk&#x27;s lineage,&quot; also known as the Haykids), such as Sisak, Skayordi, Paruyr, and Vahe, some of which he identifies as kings of Armenia. In reference to Hayk&#x27;s descent from Torgom/Togarmah, medieval Armenian sources sometimes referred to Armenia as &quot;T‘orgoma tun&quot; (&quot;House of Torgom&quot;) and to Armenians as &quot;T‘orgomyan azg&quot; (&quot;the people of Torgom&quot;). The connection between Hayk and the descendants of Noah was created by Christian authors following the Christianization of Armenia in order to connect Armenians to the biblical narrative of human history.

In the Georgian history attributed to Juansher, Hayk is likewise identified as the son of Torgom/Togarmah and described as &quot;prince of the seven brothers and stood in service to the giant Nimrod (Nebrovt&#x27;) who first ruled the entire world as king.&quot;

One of Hayk&#x27;s most famous scions, Aram (whose name Moses purports to be the origin of the name &quot;Armenia&quot;), settled in Eastern Armenia from the Mitanni kingdom (Western Armenia), when Sargon II mentions a king of part of Armenia who bore the (Armenian-Indo-Iranian) name Bagatadi (which, like the Greek-based &quot;Theodore&quot; and the Hebrew-based &quot;Jonathan,&quot; means &quot;god-given&quot;).
== Legend ==

According to the accounts of Movses Khorenatsi and the anonymous &quot;Primary History&quot;, Hayk fought against and killed the tyrannical Babylonian king Bel (Belos, Belus). Depending on the mythological tradition, Belus can refer to a symbolic Babylonian/Akkadian god of war or mythical founder of Babylon. Moses identifies Bel with the biblical Nimrod and gives a list of his ancestors and successors, drawing from the Bible and Abydenus via Eusebius&#x27;s works.

In Movses Khorenatsi&#x27;s account (which he claims to have learned from Mar Abas Catina&#x27;s writings), Hayk, son of Torgom, had a child named Aramaneak while he was living in Babylon. After the arrogant Titanid Bel made himself king over all, Hayk emigrated to the region near Mount Ararat with his extended family, servants, followers and about 300 warriors and founded a village called &quot;Haykashen&quot;. On the way he had left a detachment in another settlement with his grandson Kadmos. Bel sent one of his sons to entreat him to return, but Hayk refused. Bel decided to march against him with a massive force, but Hayk was warned ahead of time by Kadmos of his pending approach. He assembled his own army along the shore of Lake Van and told them that they must defeat and kill Bel, or die trying to do so, rather than become his slaves.
Moses writes that the armies of Hayk and Bel clashed near Lake Van &quot;in a plain between very high mountains.&quot; King Bel was initially in the vanguard, but seeing that the outcome of the battle was uncertain, he withdrew to a hill to await the arrival of the rest of his army. Seeing this, Hayk slew Bel with a nearly impossible shot using his long bow, sending the king&#x27;s forces into disarray. Hayk named the hill where Bel fell with his warriors &quot;Gerezmankʻ&quot;, meaning &quot;tombs&quot;. He embalmed the corpse of Bel and ordered it to be taken to Hark‘ where it was to be buried in a high place in the view of the wives and sons of the king. Soon after, Hayk established the fortress or settlement (&quot;dastakert&quot;) of Haykʻ or Haykaberd at the site of the battle, which, Movses Khorenatsi says, is why the district is called Hayotsʻ Dzor (&quot;The Valley of the Armenians&quot;) and the country of the Armenians is called &quot;Hayk‘&quot;.
The 18th- and 19th-century scholars Ghevont Alishan and Mikayel Chamchian, using different methods, calculated the date of the mythical battle (also known as the &quot;Dyutsaznamart&quot;, , &quot;Battle of the Giants&quot;) between Hayk and Bel to have been August 11, 2492 BCE or 2107 BCE, respectively.

==Comparative mythology==
Armen Petrosyan describes Hayk as &quot;a complex epic figure that combines the characteristics of the god creator, the father and patriarch of gods, the thunder god, and the war god&quot; that derives from Indo-European archetypes and influenced by Near Eastern mythology. Hayk is a culture hero and an etiological founding figure, like Asshur for the Assyrians, for example. The figure slain by Hayk&#x27;s arrow is variously given as Bel or Nimrod. &quot;Hayk&quot; is also the name of the constellation Orion in the Armenian translation of the Bible. Hayk&#x27;s flight from Babylon and his eventual defeat of Bel has been compared to Zeus&#x27;s escape to the Caucasus and eventual defeat of the Titans. Petrosyan considers the Indian deity Rudra to be the most similar mythological figure to Hayk. Both are associated with the constellation Orion, both have descendants or followers of the same name (&quot;Hays&quot; and &quot;Rudras&quot;) and both are archers that kill their enemy with an arrow.

<text>Brian Baden Moore (28 February 1932 – 1 September 2001) was an English football commentator and television presenter who covered nine World Cups and more than twenty FA Cup finals.

==Early life==
Moore was born in Benenden, Kent. After passing his eleven-plus, he was educated at Cranbrook School, Kent, which was also the school of fellow commentators Peter West and Barry Davies.

==Career==
Moore began his career in newspapers. His first job, in 1954, was as a sub-editor on the monthly &quot;World Sports&quot; magazine. He subsequently worked for &quot;The Exchange Telegraph&quot; for two years before moving to &quot;The Times&quot; in 1958.

===Radio===
In 1961, Moore became a football commentator and presenter on BBC Radio, and the corporation&#x27;s first football correspondent in 1963. Moore, Alan Clarke and Maurice Edelston were the commentators for BBC Radio when England won the 1966 World Cup. Moore also covered the FA Cup Final from 1964 to 1967, and European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup victories for Tottenham Hotspur in 1963 and West Ham United in 1965, and Celtic&#x27;s European Cup victory in 1967.

===London Weekend Television and ITV===
Shortly after that Moore moved to London Weekend Television, which was preparing for its launch on the ITV network in 1968. Brought to the station by head of sport Jimmy Hill, Moore remained with LWT and ITV Sport over the next three decades.

In 1970, Moore was the host of ITV&#x27;s World Cup coverage, when Moore and Hill presided over a month of panel-based coverage. Malcolm Allison, Derek Dougan, Paddy Crerand and Bob McNab were nicknamed the &quot;Midnight Cowboys&quot; by the press due to the late-night kick off times. In subsequent years, Brian Clough also appeared frequently with Moore as a pundit on ITV.

Although primarily a commentator, Moore also presented a number of other ITV Sport shows, including Saturday lunchtime preview &quot;On the Ball&quot;, Sunday highlights show &quot;The Big Match&quot; and &quot;Midweek Sports Special&quot;. He also presented &quot;Big League Soccer&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s, a show produced in England for broadcast in Australia and New Zealand. In the late 1970s he made a six-part documentary series for ITV, &quot;Brian Moore Meets...&quot;, with guests including Kevin Keegan, Niki Lauda and Björn Borg.

During thirty years at ITV, Moore commentated on European trophy wins by Arsenal, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United, Everton and Aberdeen. Moore&#x27;s commentary of the winning goal in Aston Villa&#x27;s 1982 European Cup Final win over Bayern Munich is displayed on a giant banner across the North Stand of Villa Park:

Moore also covered the FA Cup Final for ITV every year from 1969 to 1988, and again in 1998, as well as six European Championships between 1972 and 1996, missing 1984 due to England&#x27;s absence.

Moore presented ITV&#x27;s coverage of the FIFA World Cup in 1970, 1974, 1978 and 1982. In 1986, he presented the coverage from London for most of the tournament before flying out to commentate on the final. From 1990 to 1998, he commentated throughout the tournament.

He retired as a commentator in 1998 after France&#x27;s 1998 World Cup final victory at the Stade de France against Brazil, but continued to broadcast, presenting an interview programme for Sky Sports in 1999, and hosting programmes for BBC Radio 5 Live and Talksport in addition to his commentary on &quot;Gladiators&quot;. His time on Talksport included hosting &quot;Inside the Boardroom&quot;, where club chairmen and directors joined him in the studio to answer phone-in questions from the public.

In retirement he joined the team of readers for &quot;Bromley Talking Newspapers&quot;, making weekly recordings for the blind of stories from the local papers.

==Personal life==
Moore married Betty Cole in 1955. They had two sons.

Moore was a lifelong supporter of Gillingham and served as a director at the club for seven years. A stand at the club&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium is named after him.

Moore suffered from serious heart problems in his later life and twice underwent life-saving surgery for blocked arteries. After the first health scare, he became a regular churchgoer and a committed Christian. He died at the age of 69 on 1 September 2001, the day that England beat Germany 5–1 in Munich during the qualifying stages of the 2002 World Cup.
