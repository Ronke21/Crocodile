<text>Fingal&#x27;s Cave is a sea cave on the uninhabited island of Staffa, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, known for its natural acoustics. The National Trust for Scotland owns the cave as part of a national nature reserve. It became known as Fingal&#x27;s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th-century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson.

== Formation ==

Fingal&#x27;s Cave is formed entirely from hexagonally jointed basalt columns within a Paleocene lava flow and is similar in structure to both the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Northern Ireland and Ulva.

In these locations, cooling on the upper and lower surfaces of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces. As cooling continued these cracks gradually extended toward the centre of the flow, forming the long hexagonal columns we see in the wave-eroded cross-section today. Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling.

== History ==

Fingal&#x27;s Cave was originally part of the Ulva estate of the Clan MacQuarrie from an early date until 1777. The cave was brought to the attention of the English-speaking world by 18th-century naturalist Sir Joseph Banks in 1772.

It became known as Fingal&#x27;s Cave after the eponymous hero of an epic poem by 18th century Scots poet-historian James Macpherson. It formed part of his Ossian cycle of poems claimed to have been based on old Scottish Gaelic poems. In Irish mythology, the hero Fingal is known as Fionn mac Cumhaill, and it is suggested that Macpherson rendered the name as Fingal (meaning &quot;white stranger&quot;) through a misunderstanding of the name which in old Gaelic would appear as &quot;Finn&quot;. The legend of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway has Finn (or Fionn) building the causeway between Ireland and Scotland.

== Sightseeing ==

The cave has a large arched entrance and is filled by the sea. Several sightseeing cruises organised from April to September by local companies pass the entrance to the cave. In calm conditions, one can land at the island&#x27;s landing place (as some of these cruises permit) and walk the short distance to the cave, where a row of fractured columns forms a walkway just above high-water level permitting exploration on foot. From the inside, the entrance seems to frame the island of Iona across the water.

== In art and literature ==
Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn visited in 1829 and wrote an overture, &quot;The Hebrides&quot;, Op. 26, (also known as &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Cave Overture&quot;), and was said to be inspired by the weird echoes in the cave. Mendelssohn&#x27;s overture popularized the cave as a tourist destination. Other famous 19th-century visitors included author Jules Verne, who used it in his book &quot;Le Rayon Vert&quot; (&quot;The Green Ray&quot;), and mentions it in the novels &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; and &quot;The Mysterious Island&quot;. Poets William Wordsworth, John Keats, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, who painted &quot;Staffa, Fingal&#x27;s Cave&quot; in 1832 also made the trip. In 1860 the German novelist Theodor Fontane visited the cave and described it in his travel report &quot;Jenseit des Tweed&quot; (Beyond the Tweed, Pictures and Letters from Scotland), Queen Victoria also made the trip.

The 19th century Austro-Hungarian guitarist and composer Johann Kaspar Mertz included a piece entitled &quot;Fingals-Höhle&quot; in his set of character pieces for guitar &quot;Bardenklänge&quot;.

The playwright August Strindberg also set scenes from his play &quot;A Dream Play&quot; in a place called &quot;Fingal&#x27;s Grotta&quot;. Scots novelist Sir Walter Scott described Fingal&#x27;s Cave as &quot;one of the most extraordinary places I ever beheld. It exceeded, in my mind, every description I had heard of it… composed entirely of basaltic pillars as high as the roof of a cathedral, and running deep into the rock, eternally swept by a deep and swelling sea, and paved, as it were, with ruddy marble, [it] baffles all description.&quot;

Artist Matthew Barney used the cave along with the Giant&#x27;s Causeway for the opening and closing scenes of his art film, &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;. In 2008, the video artist Richard Ashrowan spent several days recording the interior of Fingal&#x27;s Cave for an exhibition at the Foksal Gallery in Poland.

One of Pink Floyd&#x27;s early songs bears this location&#x27;s name. This instrumental was written for the film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;, but not used.

Lloyd House at Caltech has a mural representing Fingal&#x27;s Cave.

The Alistair MacLean novel-based movie, &quot;When Eight Bells Toll&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins, was filmed there.

It is likely that the township of Fingal, Tasmania was named after MacPherson&#x27;s poetry rather than the cave itself.

<text>Sergey Yevgenyevich Treshchov (; born 18 August 1958) is a former cosmonaut of the RSC Energia. He spent 184 days in space as a flight engineer of the International Space Station long duration Expedition 5 crew. During the mission he also conducted a spacewalk.

== Personal ==
Treshchov was born in Volynsky District, in the Lipetsk Region of Russia. His father is Evgueniy Georgievich Treshchov, his mother is Nina Davydovna Treshchova. Treshchov and his wife, Elvira Viktorovna Treshchova have two sons, Dmitriy born in 1988 and Aleksey born in 1992. His hobbies include soccer, volleyball, ice hockey, hiking, tennis, music, photography, and video.

== Education ==
In 1976 Treshchov graduated from technical school as an electric welder. In 1982 he graduated from the Moscow Power Institute specializing in &quot;engineer-teacher of electrical power disciplines&quot;.

== Experience ==
From 1982 to 1984, Treschov served as a group leader in an Air force regiment. He worked as a foreman and as an engineer at the RSC Energia from 1984 to 1986. His responsibilities included the analysis and planning of cosmonaut activities aboard a space station and their inflight technical training. He also developed technical documentation and, together with the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center, coordinated all facets of cosmonaut training. His duties also included crew support and training for descent and emergency escape scenarios aboard the Mir space station. He also participated as a test operator during tests of the ground-based complex to optimize the Life Support System of ЭУ367/734.

== Cosmonaut career ==

In 1992, he enrolled in the RSC Energia cosmonaut detachment, and from 1992 to 1994 he completed the basic Cosmonaut training course. Treshchov spent the next 3 years (1994 to 1996) in advanced Test Cosmonaut training.

From June 1997 to February 1998, Treshchov trained as a flight engineer for the Mir station backup Exp-25 crew. From June 1999 to July 2000 he trained as a flight engineer for the Soyuz-TM backup ISS contingency crew. Initially, he trained as backup to the ISS Expedition 3 crew.

=== Expedition 5 ===
The Expedition 5 crew was launched on June 5, 2002, aboard STS-111. lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center LC-39A at 21:22:49 UTC. After two days &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on June 7, 2002, at 16:25 UTC. Treshchov joined the Expedition 5 crew as a flight engineer. The Expedition 5 crew carried out approximately 25 new investigations on board the ISS, as well as continued with various science investigations begun before their stay. The scientific investigations aimed at studying cold plasma, crystal growth, radiation effects in the space and the human body. Some medical experiments involved blood, muscles, bones while the crew also conducted psychological experiments.

The Expedition 5 crew returned to Earth on December 7, 2002, aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; STS-113 mission. The shuttle touched down at KSC Runway 33 at 19:38:25 UTC. Completing his second long duration spaceflight, Treshchev logged 184 days, 22 hours and 15 minutes in space.

=== Spacewalks ===
Treschov performed his first and only career spacewalk on August 26, 2002. The start of the spacewalk was delayed because of an air leak in the sealed hatches between the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock and the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The problem was easily corrected but took Treshchov and fellow cosmonaut Valery Korzun almost a half-hour to step through the procedures and get ready to go outside. Despite the late start at 05:27 UTC, the two spacewalkers finished everything assigned to them on this spacewalk. Wearing Russian Orlan spacesuits Treschov and Korzun installed a frame on the outside of the &quot;Zarya&quot; module to house components for future spacewalk assembly tasks. They installed new material samples on a pair of Japanese Space Agency materials exposure experiments housed on the outside of &quot;Zvezda&quot;. They installed devices on &quot;Zvezda&quot; that will simplify the routing of tethers during future assembly spacewalks. The two spacewalkers also improved future station amateur radio operations by adding two ham radio antennas on &quot;Zvezda&quot;. The spacewalk was staged from the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock and lasted 5 hours and 21 minutes.

<doc id="677060" wikidata="Q5326215" url="?curid=677060" title="Earl of Breadalbane and Holland">
<text>Earl of Breadalbane and Holland is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1681 for Sir John Campbell, 5th Baronet, of Glenorchy, who had previously been deprived of the title Earl of Caithness. It refers to Breadalbane, Scotland (; , meaning &quot;upper Alba&quot; or &quot;upland of Alba&quot;), a region of the southern/central Scottish Highlands, within the Grampian Mountains range, archaically spelt Broadalbin.

==Creation==
Sir John, as a principal creditor, had acquired the estates of George Sinclair, 6th Earl of Caithness who had died heavily in debt and without issue in 1670. Sir John was consequently created Earl of Caithness in 1673. However after much litigation and even bloodshed, George Sinclair of Keiss (died 1698), the second son of George, 5th Earl of Caithness (died 1643), recovered the estates. Sinclair of Keiss then successfully petitioned parliament regarding the earldom, which was removed from Campbell and finally restored to him in 1681. 

Thus deprived by parliament of the Caithness earldom, Sir John Campbell was created Lord Glenorchy, Benederaloch, Ormelie and Weick, Viscount of Tay and Paintland, and Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, with the precidency of the last, on 13 August 1681 as compensation. The titles were created with the power to nominate any of his sons by his first wife to succeed him, failing which to any surviving male son, then to male heirs, failing which to any heirs whatsoever. The &quot;and Holland&quot; part of the title derived from the fact that Campbell was the husband of Lady Mary Rich, daughter of Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland (see Earl of Holland). Sir John Campbell then became known as &quot;Breadalbane&quot;

=== The Glenorchy line ===
As a member of a junior branch of Clan Campbell, Breadalbane was a descendant of Sir Colin Campbell, 1st of Glenorchy (died 1475), the son of Duncan Campbell, 1st Lord Campbell by his second wife Margaret Stewart and the half-brother of Archibald Campbell, Master of Campbell, ancestor of the Dukes of Argyll. Colin Campbell was granted Glenorchy and other lands by his father, Duncan, and built Kilchurn Castle on Loch Awe in Argyll. King James III knighted him and granted him land around Loch Tay in thanks for hunting down the local earls who had assassinated James II, and to end the power vacuum in the surrounding region that had resulted when they were executed. The land around Loch Tay formed Breadalbane, creating the association between the area and Sir Colin&#x27;s descendants. 

Sir Colin&#x27;s son Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenorchy was one of the many Scottish nobles killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. Sir Duncan&#x27;s great-grandson and namesake Duncan Campbell, known as &quot;Black Duncan&quot;, represented Argyllshire in the Scottish Parliament. He was knighted in 1590 and created a baronet, of Glenorchy in the County of Perth, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in 1625. His elder son, Sir Colin, the second Baronet, died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, Sir Robert, the third Baronet. He represented Argyllshire in the Scottish Parliament. He was succeeded by his son, Sir John, the fourth Baronet. He also represented Argyllshire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his son by his first marriage, the aforementioned Sir John Campbell, the fifth Baronet, who was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland in 1681.

==History of the Title==
Lord Breadalbane and Holland&#x27;s elder son Duncan Campbell, styled Lord Ormelie, was overlooked for the succession (owing to his &quot;incapacity&quot;) and died childless in 1727. Breadalbane nominated his younger son John as his successor, as allowed by the patent, and this John consequently succeeded in the titles on his father&#x27;s death in 1717. 

John Campbell, 2nd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer between 1736 and 1747. He was succeeded by his son, also John, the third Earl. 

The third Earl was a prominent statesman, ambassador and a Lord of the Admiralty. He married as his first wife Lady Amabel Grey, daughter of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent. Their daughter Lady Jemima Campbell succeeded her maternal grandfather as Marchioness Grey in 1740. Through Lady Jemima this Lord Breadalbane was a great-grandfather of Prime Minister Lord Goderich. The third Lord Breadalbane outlived both his only son by his first wife and his two sons by his second marriage to Arabella Pershall. On his death in 1782 the male line of the first Earl failed.

The late third Earl was succeeded by his kinsman, the great-grandson of Colin Campbell of Mochaster, younger son of Sir Robert Campbell, 3rd Baronet, and uncle of the first Earl. John Campbell, who became the fourth Earl. He was a Lieutenant-General in the British Army and sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer between 1784 and 1806. In 1806 he was created Baron Breadalbane, of Taymouth Castle in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic permanent seat in the House of Lords. In 1831 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Ormelie and Marquess of Breadalbane in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his only son, John Campbell, who became the second Marquess. 

John Campbell, 2nd Marquess of Breadalbane was a Liberal politician and served twice as Lord Chamberlain of the Household. He was childless and the United Kingdom peerages of Baron Breadalbane, Earl of Ormelie and Marquess of Breadalbane became extinct on his death in 1862. He was succeeded in the Scottish titles by his kinsman, John Campbell, who became the sixth Earl. 

The sixth Earl was the grandson of James Campbell, great-great-grandson of William Campbell of Glenfalloch (died 1648) who was in turn the brother of the aforementioned Colin Campbell of Mochaster. 

On his death the titles passed to his son, Gavin, the seventh Earl. He was a Liberal politician and notably served as Treasurer of the Household and Lord Steward of the Household. In 1873 he was created Baron Breadalbane, of Kenmure in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which entitled him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. In 1885 he was made Earl of Ormelie, in the County of Caithness, and Marquess of Breadalbane in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, thus recreating the UK peerage titles held by the third Earl. Gavin Campbell was however childless and these titles consequently again became extinct on his death in 1922. He was succeeded in the Scottish titles by his nephew, Iain Campbell, the eighth Earl. 

Iain was the son of Captain the Honourable Ivan Campbell, second son of the sixth Earl. Iain, the eighth Earl, died at an early age in 1923, only a year after succeeding his uncle. 

Iain was succeeded by his kinsman, Charles Campbell, the ninth Earl. Charles was the son of Major-General Charles William Campbell of Borland, grandson of John Campbell of Borland, younger brother of the aforementioned James Campbell, grandfather of the sixth Earl. Charles Campbell, 9th Earl of Breadalbane and Holland sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish Representative Peer between 1924 and his death in 1959. He was succeeded by his only son, John, the tenth Earl. 

John was severely wounded while serving with the Black Watch in the Second World War and he died childless in 1995 when the titles became dormant.

==Pretenders==
There are claims that Hungarian-born Huba Campbell (born 1945) petitioned the Lord Lyon for recognition of his right to the Earldom of Breadalbane and Holland, together with the subsidiary titles, and to the undifferenced arms. However, an extensive search in the records of the Lyon Office and discussions with the lawyer involved shows that no such petition was ever made. Genealogist Hugh Peskett failed to find any evidence in Hungary of such a link, and the search was abandoned on 2000. The claim that Huba is the great-great-grandson of George Campbell, brother of George Andrew Campbell (1791–1852), brother of Charles William Campbell of Borland, grandfather of the ninth Earl, cannot be substantiated.

A British aristocrat, Sir Lachlan Campbell, 6th Baronet, also claims the titles. He is a descendant of Sir Guy Campbell, 1st Baronet, grandson of John Campbell, son of the Honourable Colin Campbell, the son of first Earl by his second marriage to Lady Mary Campbell. Sir Lachlan however, is apparently unable to succeed because his ancestor John Campbell was illegitimate (see Campbell baronets, of St Cross Mede, for further history of this branch of the family).

==Taymouth Castle==
The main seat of the Earls of Breadalbane and Holland from the early 19th century was the vast Taymouth Castle in Scotland, which was sold by the seventh Earl shortly after the end of the First World War in 1922.

The father of the Scottish writer Fred Urquhart was chauffeur to the Earl in the early twentieth century, and Urquhart&#x27;s novel &quot;Palace of Green Days&quot; (1979) draws on his childhood memories of this.

<doc id="677062" wikidata="Q668347" url="?curid=677062" title="Polynesian Triangle">
<text>The Polynesian Triangle is a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: Hawaii (&quot;Hawaiʻi&quot;), Easter Island (&quot;Rapa Nui&quot;) and New Zealand (&quot;Aotearoa&quot;). This is often used as a simple way to define Polynesia.

Outside the triangle, there are traces of Polynesian settlement as far north as Necker Island (&quot;Mokumanamana&quot;), as far east as Salas y Gómez Island (&quot;Motu Motiro Hiva&quot;), and as far south as Enderby Island (&quot;Motu Maha&quot;). Also, there have once been Polynesian settlements on Norfolk Island and the Kermadec Islands (&quot;Rangitahua&quot;). By the time the Europeans first arrived, these islands were all uninhabited.

Today, the most numerous Polynesian peoples are the Māori, Hawaiians (Kanaka Maoli), Tongans, Samoans, Niueans and Tahitians. The native languages of this vast triangle are Polynesian languages, which are classified by linguists as part of the Oceanic subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian. They ultimately derive from the proto-Austronesian language spoken in Southeast Asia 5,000 years ago. There are also numerous Polynesian outlier islands outside the triangle in neighboring Melanesia and Micronesia.

==History==
Anthropologists believe that all modern Polynesian cultures descend from a single protoculture established in the South Pacific by migrant Malayo-Polynesian people (&quot;see also&quot; Lapita culture). There is also some evidence that Polynesians ventured as far east as Salas and Gómez Island and as far south as the sub-Antarctic islands to the south of New Zealand. However, none of these islands are considered part of Polynesia proper, as no viable settlements have survived. There are remains of a Polynesian settlement dating back to the 13th century on Enderby Island in the Auckland Islands. A shard of pottery was also recorded to have been found in the Antipodes Islands, but the Te Papa museum in Wellington has stated that they do not possess this shard and that the original description of the find did not say anything about its being Polynesian in origin. 

In contrast to the shape of a triangle, another theory states that the geography of Polynesian society and navigation pathways more accurately resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on Ra&#x27;iātea (French Polynesia) and tentacles spread out across the Pacific. In Polynesian oral tradition the octopus is known by various names such as Taumata-Fe&#x27;e-Fa&#x27;atupu-Hau (Grand Octopus of Prosperity), Tumu-Ra&#x27;i-Fenua (Beginning-of-Heaven-and-Earth) and Te Wheke-a-Muturangi (The Octopus of Muturangi).

<doc id="677073" wikidata="Q1413579" url="?curid=677073" title="List of lakes of Iceland">
<text>Iceland has over 20 lakes larger than 10 km2 (4 sq mi), and at least 40 others varying between 2.5 and 10 km2 (1 to 4 sq mi) in size. This list also includes a few smaller lakes and ponds that are considered notable (for example Tjörnin in Reykjavik). The figures for many of the smaller lakes are unreliable. Also, some larger lakes vary considerably in size between years or seasons or, for the reservoirs, according to the needs of power plants. Some power plant reservoirs may not be present despite being larger than listed lakes.

<doc id="677078" wikidata="Q724511" url="?curid=677078" title="Meander (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a meander or closed meander is a self-avoiding closed curve which crosses a given line a number of times, meaning that it intersects the line while passing from one side to the other. Intuitively, a meander can be viewed as a meandering river with a straight road crossing the river over a number of bridges. The points where the line and the curve cross are therefore referred to as &quot;bridges&quot;.

==Meander==

Given a fixed line &quot;L&quot; in the Euclidean plane, a meander of order &quot;n&quot; is a self-avoiding closed curve in the plane that crosses the line at 2&quot;n&quot; points. Two meanders are equivalent if one meander can be continuously deformed into the other while maintaining its property of being a meander and leaving the order of the bridges on the road, in the order in which they are crossed, invariant.

===Examples===

The single meander of order 1 intersects the line twice:

This meander intersects the line four times and thus has order 2:
There are two meanders of order 2. Flipping the image vertically produces the other.

Here are two non-equivalent meanders of order 3, each intersecting the line six times:

===Meandric numbers===

The number of distinct meanders of order &quot;n&quot; is the meandric number &quot;Mn&quot;. The first fifteen meandric numbers are given below .

:&quot;M&quot;1 = 1
:&quot;M&quot;2 = 2 
:&quot;M&quot;3 = 8
:&quot;M&quot;4 = 42
:&quot;M&quot;5 = 262
:&quot;M&quot;6 = 1828
:&quot;M&quot;7 = 13820
:&quot;M&quot;8 = 110954
:&quot;M&quot;9 = 933458
:&quot;M&quot;10 = 8152860
:&quot;M&quot;11 = 73424650
:&quot;M&quot;12 = 678390116
:&quot;M&quot;13 = 6405031050
:&quot;M&quot;14 = 61606881612
:&quot;M&quot;15 = 602188541928

===Meandric permutations===

A meandric permutation of order &quot;n&quot; is defined on the set {1, 2, ..., 2&quot;n&quot;} and is determined as follows:
* With the line oriented from left to right, each intersection of the meander is consecutively labelled with the integers, starting at 1.
* The curve is oriented upward at the intersection labelled 1.
* The cyclic permutation with no fixed points is obtained by following the oriented curve through the labelled intersection points.

In the diagram on the right, the order 4 meandric permutation is given by (1 8 5 4 3 6 7 2). This is a permutation written in cyclic notation and not to be confused with one-line notation.

If π is a meandric permutation, then π2 consists of two cycles, one containing all the even symbols and the other all the odd symbols. Permutations with this property are called &quot;alternate permutations&quot;, since the symbols in the original permutation alternate between odd and even integers. However, not all alternate permutations are meandric because it may not be possible to draw them without introducing a self-intersection in the curve. For example, the order 3 alternate permutation, (1 4 3 6 5 2), is not meandric.

==Open meander==

Given a fixed line &quot;L&quot; in the Euclidean plane, an open meander of order &quot;n&quot; is a non-self-intersecting curve in the plane that crosses the line at &quot;n&quot; points. Two open meanders are equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other while maintaining its property of being an open meander and leaving the order of the bridges on the road, in the order in which they are crossed, invariant.

===Examples===

The open meander of order 1 intersects the line once:

The open meander of order 2 intersects the line twice:

===Open meandric numbers===

The number of distinct open meanders of order &quot;n&quot; is the open meandric number &quot;mn&quot;. The first fifteen open meandric numbers are given below .

:&quot;m&quot;1 = 1
:&quot;m&quot;2 = 1
:&quot;m&quot;3 = 2
:&quot;m&quot;4 = 3
:&quot;m&quot;5 = 8
:&quot;m&quot;6 = 14
:&quot;m&quot;7 = 42
:&quot;m&quot;8 = 81 
:&quot;m&quot;9 = 262
:&quot;m&quot;10 = 538
:&quot;m&quot;11 = 1828 
:&quot;m&quot;12 = 3926 
:&quot;m&quot;13 = 13820 
:&quot;m&quot;14 = 30694 
:&quot;m&quot;15 = 110954

==Semi-meander==

Given a fixed oriented ray &quot;R&quot; (a closed half line) in the Euclidean plane, a semi-meander of order &quot;n&quot; is a non-self-intersecting closed curve in the plane that crosses the ray at &quot;n&quot; points. Two semi-meanders are equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the other while maintaining its property of being a semi-meander and leaving the order of the bridges on the ray, in the order in which they are crossed, invariant.

===Examples===

The semi-meander of order 1 intersects the ray once:

The semi-meander of order 2 intersects the ray twice:

===Semi-meandric numbers===

The number of distinct semi-meanders of order &quot;n&quot; is the semi-meandric number &quot;Mn&quot; (usually denoted with an overline instead of an underline). The first fifteen semi-meandric numbers are given below .

:&quot;M&quot;1 = 1
:&quot;M&quot;2 = 1
:&quot;M&quot;3 = 2
:&quot;M&quot;4 = 4
:&quot;M&quot;5 = 10
:&quot;M&quot;6 = 24
:&quot;M&quot;7 = 66
:&quot;M&quot;8 = 174
:&quot;M&quot;9 = 504
:&quot;M&quot;10 = 1406
:&quot;M&quot;11 = 4210
:&quot;M&quot;12 = 12198
:&quot;M&quot;13 = 37378
:&quot;M&quot;14 = 111278
:&quot;M&quot;15 = 346846

==Properties of meandric numbers==

There is an injective function from meandric to open meandric numbers:
:&quot;Mn&quot; = &quot;m&quot;2&quot;n&quot;−1

Each meandric number can be bounded by semi-meandric numbers:
:&quot;Mn&quot; ≤ &quot;Mn&quot; ≤ &quot;M&quot;2&quot;n&quot;

For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, meandric numbers are even:
:&quot;Mn&quot; ≡ 0 (mod 2)

<doc id="677082" wikidata="Q376688" url="?curid=677082" title="Yuri Usachov">
<text>Yury Vladimirovich Usachov (; born October 9, 1957) is a former cosmonaut who resides in Star City, Moscow. Usachov is a veteran of four spaceflights, including two long-duration missions on board the &quot;Mir&quot; Space Station and another on board the International Space Station. During his career, he also conducted seven spacewalks before his retirement on April 5, 2004.

==Personal==
Married to Vera Sergeevna Usachova (née Nazarova) from the Kaliningrad. They have one daughter, Zhenya. His mother, Anna Grigorevna Usachova resides in Donetsk. His father is deceased. He has a brother, five years older, and a twin sister, five minutes older. He enjoys photography and video production.

==Education==
Usachov graduated from the Donetsk Public School in 1975. In 1985, he graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute with an engineering diploma.

==Experience==
Upon graduation from the Aviation Institute, he went to work for Energia, participating in groups working with EVA training, future construction in space, public relations, and ergonomics.

== Cosmonaut career ==

In 1989, he was appointed to the position of cosmonaut candidate at the Cosmonaut Training Center. From 1989 to 1992, he underwent a course of general space training. He was a member of the back-up crew for the Mir-13, 14 and 19 missions. From January 8 to July 9, 1994, he served as Board Engineer on Space Station Mir.

=== Mir EO-15===
Usachov made his first trip into space on January 8, 1994. The Soyuz TM-18 spacecraft carrying Usachov with cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Valeri Polyakov lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 10:05:34 UTC. Usachov served as the flight engineer. After two days of solo flight, Soyuz TM-18 docked at the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module of the &quot;Mir&quot; space station on January 10 at 11:15 UTC. The three cosmonauts became the 15th resident crew of the Mir. Usachov joined as a flight engineer. He was on board &quot;Mir&quot; on January 14, when the departing Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft struck &quot;Kristall&quot; module two glancing blows during the customary inspection fly-around prior to the deorbit burn. After the incident, the EO-15 crew on &quot;Mir&quot; checked over &quot;Kristall&quot; and found no damage. During Usachov&#x27;s stay three Progress spacecraft arrived at &quot;Mir&quot;. On 30 January, on March 24 and on May 24: Progress M-21, Progress M-22 and Progress M-23 spacecraft arrived at &quot;Mir&quot;. The Progress spacecraft delivered food, water, fuel, spare parts and equipment for the maintenance of &quot;Mir&quot;″s systems and additional equipment for medical experiments.

Usachov and Afanasyev uneventfully returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-18 descent module, which landed 110 km north of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan at 10:32:35 GMT on July 9, 1994. Usachov flew on the &quot;Mir&quot; space station for 182 days.

=== Mir EO-21 ===
From February 21 to September 2, 1996, Usachov served as a Board Engineer of the Mir EO-21 expedition. The Soyuz TM-23 spacecraft carrying Usachov with cosmonaut Yuri Onufriyenko lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 21, 1996, at 12:34:05 UTC. After two days of autonomous flight, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir space station&#x27;s forward-facing port on February 23 at 14:20 UTC. One month later, he and Onufriyenko were joined by NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid. During Mir-21 Usachev performed numerous research experiments. The new module &quot;Priroda&quot;, the seventh and final module of the Mir Space Station arrived on April 26, 1996. Its primary purpose was to conduct Earth resource experiments through remote sensing and to develop and verify remote sensing methods. During Mir EO-21 supplies arrived with the Progress M-31 spacecraft. Usachov and Onufriyenko were joined by French astronaut Claudie André-Deshays after the departure of Shannon Lucid.

On September 2, 1996, Usachov, Yuri Onufriyenko and Claudie André-Deshays returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-23 capsule. The spacecraft landed at 07:41:40 UTC 108 km south west of Akmola (Tselinograd). On board Soyuz TM-23 and Mir, Usachov spent 193 days in space.

=== STS 101 ===
Usachov next flew on STS-101, the third Shuttle mission devoted to International Space Station (ISS) construction. On 9 May 2000 at 6:11 a.m. EDT lifted off from Kennedy Space Center. Usachov served as a mission specialist and was seated down on &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ middeck for both entry and landing. The primary mission objectives for STS-101 was to deliver supplies to the International Space Station, with the supplies hauled up using a Spacehab double module and Spacehab Integrated Cargo Carrier pallet, perform a spacewalk and then reboost the station from 230 to 250 statute miles (370 to 402 km). Usachov and NASA astronaut Susan Helms were the first crew members to enter the station. On Flight Days 5 and 6 of the mission, Usachov and Helms replaced two of six batteries in the &quot;Zarya&quot; module along with some associated battery-charging electronics. Usachov and Helms also installed a new Radio Telemetry System in the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, a memory unit that can store data on board when the station is not in communications with the ground. The new memory unit replaced one that was nearing the end of its planned operational lifetime. On Flight Day 8, he and Helms began backing out of the ISS by closing five hatches behind them. On the day, Usachov also took some time to talk with Russian media gathered at the Russian Mission Control Center. On the next day Usachov with other shuttle crewmembers continued stowing away equipment used over their time in orbit.

On May 29, &quot;Atlantis&quot; flew to a nighttime touchdown at KSC Runway 15 at 2:20 a.m. EDT after completing a 4,076,000 mile mission. &quot;Atlantis&quot; circled the globe 155 times for a mission duration of 9 days, 21 hours, 10 minutes.

=== Expedition 2 ===

Usachov made his fourth trip into space on board on STS-102. Launched from KSC on March 8, 2001, at 06:42 EST &quot;Discovery&quot; successfully docked with the ISS a day later on March 9 at 6:38 UTC. The Expedition 2 crew of Usachov and NASA astronauts Susan Helms and James Voss lived and worked aboard ISS for the next 167 days. Usachov was the commander of Expedition 2. During Expedition 2, research facilities launched to the ISS included a Human Research Facility, two EXPRESS (Expedite the Processing of Experiments to the Space Station) Racks, one of which contains the Active Rack Isolation System and the Payload Equipment Restraint System. They also prepared the Destiny laboratory to enable upcoming experiments to be conducted. A major focus was on gaining a better understanding of how to protect crew members from radiation while working and living in space. There were four Space Shuttle and one Soyuz missions to the ISS during Expedition 2: STS-102, STS-100, STS-104, STS-105 and Soyuz TM-32.

Usachov, Helms and Voss returned to Earth with the crew of STS-105 on August 22, 2001, on the Shuttle flight delivering the third Expedition crew.

=== Spacewalks ===
Usachov has performed seven career spacewalks. He performed six spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir Space Station and performed another internal spacewalk during his visit to the ISS as the commander of the Expedition 2.

On 15 March 1996, Usachov performed his first career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Onufriyenko started the spacewalk at 01:04 UTC. They installed the second Strela boom and prepared for Mir Cooperative Solar Array (MCSA) installation. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 51 minutes.

On 20 May 1996, Usachov performed his second career spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 22:50 UTC and ended at 04:10 UTC clocking 5 hours and 20 minutes. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts removed the Mir cooperative solar array (MCSA) from its stowed position on the exterior of the docking module at the base of the &quot;Kristall&quot; module. They used the Strela boom to reach and move the array to the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module. The two spacewalkers also inflated an aluminum and nylon pup-up model of a Pepsi Cola can, which they then filmed against the backdrop of Earth. The Pepsi Cola company paid for the procedure and planned to use the film in a television commercial. However, the commercial never aired—reportedly because Pepsi later changed the design of the can.

Usachov performed his third career spacewalk on 24 May 1996. He and cosmonaut Onufriyenko started the spacewalk at 22:50 UTC. They installed the MCSA on the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes.

On 30 May 1996, Usachov stepped outside the Mir Space Station to conduct his fourth career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Onufriyenko started the spacewalk at 18:20 UTC. They installed the modular optoelectrical multispectral scanner (MOMS) outside &quot;Priroda&quot; and handrails on the &quot;Kvant-2&quot; module to facilitate moving around outside the station during future extravehicular activities. MOMS was used to study the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and environment. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes.

On 6 June 1996, Usachov performed his fifth career spacewalk. He and Onufriyenko installed micro-meteoroid detectors and replaced cassettes in the Swiss/Russian Komza experiment and installed the Particle Impact Experiment, the Mir Sample Return Experiment, and the SKK-11 cassette, which exposed construction materials to space conditions. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 34 minutes.

Usachov performed his sixth career spacewalk on 13 June 1996. The spacewalk started at 12:45 UTC and ended at 18:27 UTC clocking 5 hours and 42 minutes. During the spacewalk, Usachov and Onufriyenko installed the Rapana truss structure (an experiment mounting point) to the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module. The two cosmonauts also manually deployed the saddle-shaped traverse synthetic aperture radar antenna on &quot;Priroda&quot;. The large antenna had failed to open fully after receiving commands from inside Mir.

On June 8, 2001, Usachov performed his seventh career spacewalk. He and NASA astronaut James Voss donned spacesuits entered the small, spherical transfer compartment at the forward end of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; Service Module during an &quot;internal&quot; spacewalk. The spacewalk at the ISS was the first without the presence of a shuttle. Just after the ISS flew over the dark side of the Earth, they removed a hatch at the Earth-facing part of the compartment to open it to the vacuum of space and officially begin the spacewalk at 9:21 a.m CDT. During the 19-minute spacewalk which ended at 9:40 a.m. CDT, Usachov and Voss moved a docking cone from storage and using a rotating handle, installed it in the lower port hatch. The installation of the docking cone was necessary to prepare for the arrival of the Russian docking compartment.

<doc id="677097" wikidata="Q7910651" url="?curid=677097" title="Valencia College">
<text>Valencia College (VC) is a public college located in Orlando, Florida. Established in 1967, it is a member of the Florida College System and is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to offer associate and bachelor’s degrees, as well as several vocational certificates.

Valencia operates multiple campuses across Orange and Osceola counties. It collaborates with local schools and businesses and participates in community programs and initiatives to support academic and career development.

==History==
The college was established in February 1967 as Valencia Junior College by the Orange County Board of Public Instruction and the Florida State Board of Education, under authority from the 1961 Florida Legislature. In July 1967, the College Advisory Committee was reconstituted as the Valencia Junior College Board of Trustees, replacing the Orange County Board of Public Instruction as the governing body. Classes began in the fall of 1967 in temporary facilities on West Oak Ridge Road in Orlando. In 1971, the college was renamed Valencia Community College and moved to a larger, permanent site on South Kirkman Road, known as the &quot;West campus.&quot;

To accommodate growing demand, Valencia Community College expanded by opening additional campuses: the East campus in 1975, the Osceola campus in Kissimmee in 1997, and the Winter Park campus in 1998.

In the 2000s, Valencia established numerous partnerships to enhance academic and economic development. Notable initiatives include the opening of the Walt Disney World Center for Hospitality and Culinary Arts in 2002, the launch of the Criminal Justice Institute in 2004, and the initiation of the &quot;DirectConnect to UCF&quot; program in 2006, which guarantees Valencia graduates admission to the University of Central Florida. Other partnerships included the Horizon Scholars Program with Orange County Public Schools in 2008, the Photonics Academy at Wekiva High School in 2009, and a training program for the Transportation Security Administration at Orlando International Airport in 2010. The college also collaborated with companies like Lockheed Martin and Universal Studios Florida.

In July 2011, the college was renamed &quot;Valencia College&quot; and began offering bachelor’s degrees, with new programs in radiologic and imaging sciences and electrical and computer engineering technology. The same year, it received the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, recognizing its achievements in graduation rates, job placement, and innovative programs. Since then, the college has continued to expand its facilities and programs to meet community needs, opening the Lake Nona campus in 2012, the Poinciana campus in 2017, and the Downtown campus in partnership with the University of Central Florida. The Advanced Manufacturing Training Center was launched in Kissimmee in 2016, followed by additional Centers for Accelerated Training at the Poinciana and Downtown campuses. In 2019, the college inaugurated a new Center for Accelerated Training and Careers in Industry and Technology at the Osceola campus and celebrated its 50th commencement ceremony. In 2021, Valencia College opened its largest center for accelerated training to date, the Valencia College Heart of Florida United Way Center for Accelerated Training in northwest Orlando.

<text>David Quantick (born 14 May 1961) is an English novelist, comedy writer and critic, who has worked as a journalist and screenwriter. A former freelance writer for the music magazine &quot;NME&quot;, his writing credits have included &quot;On the Hour&quot;, &quot;Blue Jam&quot; and &quot;TV Burp&quot;. He won an Emmy Award for &quot;Veep&quot; in 2015.

==Early life==
Quantick was born in Wortley, West Riding of Yorkshire (now South Yorkshire) on 14 May 1961, adopted, and moved at an early age with his family to Plymouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/book-of-love-interview&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Quantick spent the 1970s in Exmouth. Quantick went to Woodford Junior School and Plymouth College, then Exmouth Comprehensive School.

He was born in 1961, in a mother-and-baby home in Wortley, Yorkshire. His mother lived in the Midlands and went to stay with an aunt In Derbyshire to conceal the fact she was pregnant. He was adopted by a family, who were living in Sheffield at the time and then moved to Plymouth.

Quantick studied for a Law degree at University College London and &quot;discovered I had no aptitude. They had these &#x27;moot courts&#x27; - simulated a court hearings - and all I remember is dressing up in a cape like Batman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;londonfreelance/fecklessness&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and took a Civil Service exam &quot;to please my parents&quot; and nearly failed&quot; - &quot;which was a shock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chroniclelive/17417404&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunderland/happier&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

 &quot;The school I went to has a mentor system. I was asked to go back and give a talk on &#x27;having a dream&#x27;. I told them I believe strongly that you should not have a dream.&quot; - David Quantick

==Career==

Quantick began writing for the music publication &quot;NME&quot; in 1983, where with Steven Wells he concentrated on comedy writing until 1995. Alongside this, he also contributed material to British comedy shows such as &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. In 1992, he joined the writing team for the Radio 4 spoof news programme &quot;On the Hour&quot;, before writing for the television follow-up &quot;The Day Today&quot; in 1994. He appeared regularly on &quot;Collins and Maconie&#x27;s Hit Parade&quot; (Radio 1, 1994–1997), with his &quot;Quantick&#x27;s World&quot; slot and on the weekly show, &quot;The Treatment&quot; on BBC Radio Five Live, which was an hour-long satirical news round-up. 

In 1995, Quantick presented a pilot show called &quot;Now What?&quot; to Carlton Television but he series was not picked up for development. He wrote with Chris Morris for &quot;Brass Eye&quot; in 1996 (broadcast in 1997) and &quot;Blue Jam&quot; (Radio 1, 1997), as well as the subsequent television version &quot;Jam&quot; (Channel 4, 2000). He also provided material for &quot;Smack the Pony&quot; (Channel 4, 1999–2001), &quot;Harry Enfield&#x27;s Brand Spanking New Show&quot; (Sky One, 2000), &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; (Channel 4, 1998) and featured on Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The 99p Challenge&quot;.

Working with Jane Bussmann, he co-wrote and performed &quot;Bussmann &amp; Quantick Kingsize&quot; for BBC Radio 4 in 1998. 

In 2000, Bussmann and Quantick created, specifically made for download over the web,&lt;ref name=&quot;serializd/1855&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; what Quantick has claimed was the world&#x27;s first&lt;ref name=&quot;popontrial/70s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; internet sitcom and &quot;docusitcom&quot; (documentary/sitcom), &quot;The Junkies&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;thejunkies/2000-06-04&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; about three heroin addicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;popriot/junkies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starring Peter Baynham, Sally Phillips, Peter Serafinowicz, and Kevin Eldon in a cameo appearance, the writing pair claimed the project grew out of their frustration with the commissioning process. They argued the average sitcom cost £200,000 to make and was difficult to finance, so they secured the services of cast and crew on a voluntary basis and made a show for less than £4,000. The site received over a million visits in its first eight months of existence. The pilot was later uploaded to Quantick&#x27;s YouTube.&lt;ref name=&quot;beyondthejoke/Sitcom-YouTube&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Quantick&#x27;s biography of the Clash was published, with further books appearing in 2001. That year he collaborated with Andrew Collins and Stuart Maconie on &quot;Lloyd Cole Knew My Father&quot;, a live show about working as a music journalist. A performance was later broadcast on Radio 2 as a six-episode series. In 2003 and 2005, Quantick contributed material to sketch show &quot;That Mitchell and Webb Sound&quot;, five series of &quot;15 Minute Musical&quot; (2004–08) and several series of &quot;Parsons and Naylor&#x27;s Pull-Out Sections&quot;. He also made several appearances on Clive Anderson&#x27;s radio panel show &quot;We&#x27;ve Been Here Before&quot; in 2003 and 2004. 

In 2005, Quantick appeared in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;. Between 2003 and 2005 Quantick co-presented a weekly programme &quot;One Way Single Parent Family Favourites&quot; on London based community arts radio station Resonance FM. In 2006 he wrote and presented series 3 of &#x27;The Blagger&#x27;s Guide&#x27;, a six-part comedy series on BBC Radio 2 and appeared as &quot;Doctor Dave Radio&quot; on Radio 2 comedy programme, &quot;Radio Rivron&quot;. Between 2001 and 2012 He was also part of the writing team of &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;. Following its final series, Quantick contributed material to &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, helped write material for the comedian Rob Brydon, and recorded further editions of &quot;The Blagger&#x27;s Guide&quot; for Radio 2 until 2014.

In September 2012, Quantick published an e-book novel, &quot;Sparks&quot;, which was positively reviewed by Neil Gaiman and Ben Aaronovitch. He produced a four-episode comedy series &quot;52 First Impressions with David Quantick&quot; for Radio 4 in 2014 in which he recounted stories about 52 individuals he had encountered in his life/career. He received an Emmy in 2015 for his work on the HBO series &quot;Veep&quot;. That year he crowd-funded a novel &quot;The Mule&quot; via the Unbound company which was released on 25 February 2016. He had two writing manuals published with Oberon Books: &quot;How To Write Everything&quot; in 2015, then &quot;How to Be a Writer: Conversations With Writers About Writing&quot; the following year. 

In April 2019, his novel &quot;All My Colors&quot; came out, described by the author David M Barnett as &quot;a blend of Murakami-ish otherworldliness, Stephen King small town horror and Douglas Adams-esque absurdity.&quot;

In 2019, Quantick became a Visiting Professor with the University of Sunderland.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunderlandmagazine/screenwriter&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunderlandecho/professor&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sunderlandbusinesspartnership/tv-writer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2022, Quantick&#x27;s first movie, &quot;Book Of Love&quot;, was released. In the same year it won Best Primetime Movie at the 2022 Imagen Awards.

==Personal life==
Quantick has lived in East Sussex since about 2011.

He has worked as a flight crew representative in the area of Shuttle safety, as a CAPCOM, providing a communications interface between ground controllers and flight crews during simulations and Shuttle flights, and as the Astronaut Office Training Officer. After his third spaceflight, Voss spent two years training at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia. He served as a backup to Michael Foale on the STS-84/Mir 23/Mir 24/STS-86 mission and to Andrew Thomas for the STS-89/Mir 24/Mir 25/STS-91 mission. After his fifth flight, Voss served as the Deputy for Flight Operations in the Space Station Program Mission Integration and Operations Office.

===Spaceflight experience===
====STS-44====
Voss was a mission specialist on board Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-44 from November 24 – December 1, 1991. The mission&#x27;s primary objective was the deployment of a Defense Support Program satellite with an Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket. The crew also conducted two Military Man in Space experiments, three radiation monitoring experiments, and numerous medical tests to support longer duration spaceflight. The mission orbited the Earth 110 times before returning to Edwards Air Force Base in California.

====STS-53====

From December 2–9, 1992, Voss flew as a mission specialist on STS-53. The 171 orbit flight of the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed a classified Department of Defense payload. The satellite was the second launch of a Satellite Data System-2 military communications satellite.

====STS-69====
During STS-69, Voss was a mission specialist and payload commander on board Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. The flight, which orbited the Earth 171 times from September 7–18, 1995, successfully deployed a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility. Also on board was the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker Payload as well as various medical experiments. Voss and Michael Gernhardt performed a six-hour spacewalk in order to test space suit modifications and to evaluate tools and procedures for future use on the International Space Station.

====STS-101====
Voss was a mission specialist on board Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-101. The Shuttle visited the then-unmanned International Space Station and delivered over 3,000 pounds of equipment and supplies. The crew also repaired the Station&#x27;s electrical and environmental control systems. At the time of the flight Jim was already assigned to fly on Expedition 2. His crewmates Yuri Usachev and Susan Helms flew with him on &quot;Atlantis&quot; in order to gain experience for their future long-duration stay. Jim and Jeff Williams conducted a six-hour spacewalk to finish installation of a Russian crane, replace a faulty antenna, and install handrails on the outside of the station.

====STS-102====
Voss and his Expedition 2 crewmates launched as Mission Specialists March 8, 2001, on board Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; during the STS-102 mission. The primary objectives of the flight were to rotate crew members and to resupply the station using the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module. Voss participated in one of the missions two spacewalks, along with Susan Helms, to prepare a Pressurized Mating Adapter for relocation. The spacewalk set a record of 8 hours 56 minutes duration, that withstood until, it was broken by two Chinese astronauts on 17 December 2024.

====Expedition 2====

Voss, Susan Helms, and Yuri Usachev spent 163 days aboard the International Space Station conducting 18 scientific experiments, maintenance, and outfitting. During the flight, Jim (who was a Flight Engineer) was the first person to operate the Space Station Robotic Manipulator System (Canadarm2). He also participated in a 19-minute EVA, in which Voss and Usachev prepared a docking probe for the arrival of the Pirs Docking Compartment. During Jims stay on the ISS, the space station was visited by two unmanned cargo vehicles, the Soyuz TM-32 taxi mission, as well as two Space Shuttles (STS-100 and STS-104). Voss was also on board to witness the arrival of the Quest Airlock. He was one of the cinematographers and featured astronauts of the first 3D film shot in space, Space Station 3D. The film was released in theaters in 2002 and on DVD in 2005.

====STS-105====
Voss returned home from his fifth spaceflight as a mission specialist on board the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; on August 20, 2001 (STS-105). The mission saw a crew rotation, two spacewalks, and another flight of the MPLM.

==Post-NASA career==
After retiring from NASA in 2003, Voss became Associate Dean of Engineering for External Affairs at Auburn University, assisting with student projects and development for the College and teaching a class in Aerospace Engineering on human spacecraft design. While at Auburn he led a team of twelve aerospace engineering seniors and one graduate research assistant in the development of a crew seat prototype for space startup Transformational Space Corporation , or t/Space. In 2005, Voss became VP of Space Exploration Systems for t/Space.In November 2007 Voss left t/Space to become the Vice President of Engineering at SpaceDev. After SpaceDev was acquired by Sierra Nevada Corporation he became Sierra Nevada Corporation&#x27;s director of advanced programs and, then VP of Space Exploration Systems and program executive on the Dream Chaser spaceplane. In August 2009 Voss began teaching as a Scholar in Residence at the University of Colorado at Boulder teaching a class on human spaceflight.

He retired from SNC in July 2013 and continues to teach human spaceflight classes at the University of Colorado. Voss is a member of the NASA Advisory Council and on the Board of Directors of the National Space Biomedical Research Institute.

<doc id="677116" wikidata="Q1022873" url="?curid=677116" title="CASSIOPE">
<text>Cascade, Smallsat and Ionospheric Polar Explorer (CASSIOPE), is a Canadian Space Agency (CSA) multi-mission satellite operated by the University of Calgary. The mission development and operations from launch to February 2018 was funded through CSA and the Technology Partnerships Canada program. In February 2018 CASSIOPE became part of the European Space Agency&#x27;s Swarm constellation through the Third Party Mission Program, known as Swarm Echo, or Swarm-E. It was launched September 29, 2013, on the first flight of the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 launch vehicle. CASSIOPE is the first Canadian hybrid satellite to carry a dual mission in the fields of telecommunications and scientific research. The main objectives are to gather information to better understand the science of space weather, while verifying high-speed communications concepts through the use of advanced space technologies.

The satellite was deployed in an elliptical polar orbit and carries a commercial communications system called Cascade as well as a scientific experiment package called e-POP (enhanced Polar Outflow Probe).

Following staging, the Falcon 9&#x27;s first stage was used by SpaceX for a controlled descent and landing test. While the first stage was destroyed on impact with the ocean, significant data was acquired and the test was considered a success.

==Spacecraft==
CASSIOPE is a small satellite that is long and high. It combines the function of two distinct missions in order to be more cost-effective and reduce risk.

The spacecraft carries a primary payload of two instrument suites: the Cascade commercial communications system and a scientific payload named e-POP.

===Cascade===
The commercial payload, named Cascade, is a technology demonstrator courier in the sky, aimed at providing a proof of concept for a digital broadband courier service for commercial use. Built by MDA, the operational concept is to receive very large data files as the satellite orbits the globe, store them onboard temporarily, then deliver them at a later time to nearly any destination worldwide.

The demonstrator will provide a secure digital store-and-forward file delivery service, exploiting the fact that CASSIOPE passes over much of the globe 15 times per day. It has been described as a courier service, with the customers using a small parabolic antenna of one or two meters (three or six feet) to upload or download files at a rate of 1.2 gigabits per second. The storage capacity will be between 50 and 500 gigabytes and the data delivery time will be about 90 minutes, depending on the pickup and deposit points on the globe.

===e-POP===
The e-POP portion of CASSIOPE is a suite of eight scientific instruments. The University of Calgary&#x27;s Institute for Space Research leads the science project, while MDA is the prime contractor for the mission including launch and operation of the spacecraft. The orbital science mission is scheduled for a 21-month duration.

e-POP will gather data on Solar storms in the upper atmosphere. These storms give rise to the polar aurora or northern lights seen in the skies in northern latitudes. While these atmospheric glows may offer a thrilling night time spectacle, the inducing radiation can interfere with radio communications, GPS navigation, and other space-based systems. The eight scientific instruments aboard CASSIOPE will help scientists understand solar weather and eventually plan for measures to mitigate its deleterious effects.

The e-POP payload contains eight scientific instruments:
*Coherent EM Radio Tomography (CER), measuring radio propagation and ionospheric scintillation
*Fast Auroral Imager (FAI), measuring large-scale auroral emissions
*GPS Altitude and Profiling Experiment (GAP), high-precision position and attitude determination
*Imaging and Rapid Scanning Ion Mass Spectrometer (IRM), measuring the three-dimensional distribution of ions
*Fluxgate Magnetometer (MGF), high-precision magnetic field perturbation measurement
*Neutral Mass Spectrometer (NMS), measuring the mass, composition and velocity of neutral particles
*Radio Receiver Instrument (RRI), measuring radio wave propagation
*Suprathermal Electron Imager (SEI), measuring low-energy electron distribution

==Operations==
After a successful launch on September 29, 2013, CASSIOPE entered into a commissioning phase that lasted to January 1, 2014, with no faults detected on the spacecraft bus or payloads. Three ground stations were utilized, including Kiruna (Sweden), Inuvik (Canada), and the German Antarctic Receiving Station at the General Bernardo O&#x27;Higgins Base in Antarctica. Routine operations were scheduled to run to March, 2015. The mission was extended via funding from the Technology Partnerships Canada program through the Industrial Technologies Office that was part of the Canadian government at the time. In February 2018, the European Space Agency, through the Third Party Mission Program, integrated the mission into the Swarm constellation of satellites, dubbing CASSIOPE &quot;Swarm-Echo&quot;, recognizing the synergy between the two missions in collecting space weather data in low Earth orbit. The partnership allowed for four ground station contacts per day, rather than one, greatly increasing the amount of data that could be downloaded from the e-POP suite of instruments.

On August 11, 2016, one of the four reaction wheels used for spacecraft attitude control failed. This did not affect spacecraft operations in a significant way since only three wheels are required for 3-axis stabilized pointing. A second reaction wheel failed on February 27, 2021, forcing the spacecraft into a slowly spinning, safe-hold attitude configuration. Three-axis stabilized control was restored in September 2021 by implementing a bias momentum configuration on the two remaining wheels (spinning the wheels in opposite directions), and using the magnetic torque rods for attitude control. Three months later, on December 17, 2021, a third reaction wheel failed, leaving the spacecraft with no viable methods for fixed attitude pointing. Although most of the e-POP instruments were fully operational, without stabilized pointing much of the science objectives could not be met, resulting in a conclusion of the operational portion of the mission on December 31, 2021.

==History==

The satellite that became CASSIOPE began with a 1996 concept for a small (), inexpensive microsatellite called &quot;Polar Outflow Probe&quot;, or POP. The Canadian Space Agency funded a 1997 feasibility study that led to a modified mission concept that was designed during 2000-2005.
The revised concept was to combine an enhanced version of POP, called e-POP, with an MDA Corporation commercial satellite called &quot;Cascade&quot;, into a single satellite, and to design and build a generic, low-cost small satellite bus that would be useful for other Canadian satellite missions in the future.

The eight e-POP scientific instruments were built, calibrated, and tested in 2005-2007, with integration onto the satellite bus for spacecraft-level testing in 2008-2009.

==Launch==
The satellite was launched on September 29, 2013, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 rocket.

At the time the launch was contracted in 2005, a SpaceX Falcon 1 was the planned launch vehicle. The launch was originally scheduled for 2008 from Omelek Island. The launch date slipped several times, and after SpaceX discontinued the Falcon 1, the launch was shifted to the much larger Falcon 9 in June 2010.

MDA contracted with SpaceX to put the CASSIOPE payload on the first flight of an essentially new launch vehicle—a non-operational demonstration launch. The Falcon 9 v1.1, upgraded from the original Falcon 9, is a 60 percent heavier rocket with 60% more thrust. The flight was contracted with a payload mass that is very small relative to the rocket&#x27;s capability, at a discounted rate because it was a technology demonstration mission for SpaceX, approximately 20% of the normal published price for SpaceX Falcon 9 LEO missions.

Since this was the first flight of a new launch vehicle, the US Air Force had estimated the overall probability of failure on the mission was nearly fifty percent. In the event, the mission was successful, as was each of the next 13 Falcon 9 v1.1 missions before a launch vehicle failure and loss of mission occurred on Falcon 9 Flight 19 in June 2015.

The Falcon 9 upper stage used to launch CASSIOPE was left derelict in a decaying elliptical low Earth orbit that, , had a perigee of and an apogee of .

===Post-mission launch vehicle testing===
After the second stage separated from the booster stage, SpaceX conducted a novel flight test where the booster conducted a test to attempt to reenter the lower atmosphere in a controlled manner and decelerate to a simulated over-water landing. The test was successful, but the booster stage was not recovered.

After the three-minute boost phase of September 29, 2013 launch, the booster stage attitude was reversed, and three of the nine engines refired at high altitude, as planned, to initiate the deceleration and controlled descent trajectory to the surface of the ocean. The first phase of the test worked well and the first stage re-entered safely.

However, the first stage began to roll due to aerodynamic forces during the descent through the atmosphere, and the roll rate exceeded the capabilities of the booster attitude control system (ACS) to null it out. The fuel in the tanks centrifuged to the outside of the tank and the single engine involved in the low-altitude deceleration maneuver shut down. Debris from the first stage was subsequently retrieved from the ocean.

SpaceX also ran a post-mission test on the second stage. While a number of the new capabilities were successfully tested on the September 29, 2013, CASSIOPE flight, there was an issue with the second stage restart test. The test to reignite the second stage Merlin 1D vacuum engine once the rocket had deployed its primary payload (CASSIOPE) and all of its nanosat secondary payloads was unsuccessful.
The engine failed to restart while the second stage was coasting in low Earth orbit.

===Secondary payloads===
Five nanosatellite spacecraft that were also carried to orbit on the same launch vehicle that carried the CASSIOPE primary payload:
*CUSat, Cornell University
*Drag and Atmospheric Neutral Density Explorer (DANDE), University of Colorado Boulder
*three Polar Orbiting Passive Atmospheric Calibration Spheres (POPACS), each a white aluminum sphere, joint project of Morehead State University, University of Arkansas, Montana State University, Drexel University, and Planetary Systems Corporation.

<text>Charles Lacy Veach (September 18, 1944 – October 3, 1995) was a United States Air Force (USAF) fighter pilot and NASA astronaut.

==Personal data==
Veach was born September 18, 1944, in Chicago, Illinois, but considered Honolulu, Hawaii, to be his hometown. He was married to Alice Meigs Scott of Waycross, Georgia, they had two children. He enjoyed surfing, bicycling, reading and activities with his family. His parents reside in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was also known as Lacy Veach.

==Education==
* 1962: Graduated from Punahou School, Honolulu, Hawaii
* 1966: Received a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Management from the United States Air Force Academy

==Special honors==
*Distinguished Flying Cross with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters
*Air Medal with 13 Oak Leaf Clusters
*Air Force Commendation Medal with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster
*Purple Heart

==Experience==
Veach was commissioned in the United States Air Force upon graduation from the United States Air Force Academy. He received his pilot wings at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, in 1967, and then attended fighter gunnery school at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Over the next 14 years, he served as a USAF fighter pilot, flying the F-100 Super Sabre, the F-111 Aardvark, and the F-105 Thunderchief, on assignments in the United States, Europe, and the Far East, including a 275-mission combat tour in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. In 1976 and 1977, he was a member of the USAF Air Demonstration Squadron, the Thunderbirds, flying the T-38 Talon. Veach left active duty in 1981 but continued to fly fighters as an F-4 Phantom and F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot with the 147th Fighter Group, later 147th Fighter Wing, of the Texas Air National Guard. His name still adorns the museum display F-16 just inside the front gate of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base in Houston, Texas.

He had logged over 5,000 flying hours.

==NASA experience==
Veach came to work for NASA in January 1982 as an engineer and research pilot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. His primary duty was as an instructor pilot in the Shuttle Training Aircraft, the highly modified Gulfstream II used to train astronaut pilots to land the Space Shuttle.

Veach was selected as an astronaut candidate in May 1984 and became an astronaut in June 1985. He held a variety of technical assignments, and had flown as a mission specialist on two Space Shuttle missions, STS-39 in 1991 and STS-52 in 1992. He had logged 436.3 hours in space. Most recently, Lacy had worked as the lead astronaut for the development and operation of robotics for the International Space Station.

On STS-39, Veach was responsible for operating a group of instruments which included an ultraviolet astronomical camera, an x-ray telescope, and a liquid helium-cooled infrared telescope which performed landmark observations of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and the Aurora Australis (the Southern Lights). The 8-day unclassified Department of Defense mission aboard the Orbiter Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on April 28, 1991, and landed at Kennedy on May 6, 1991.

STS-52 was a 10-day mission aboard the Orbiter Columbia during which the crew successfully deployed the Laser Geodynamic Satellite (LAGEOS), a joint Italian-American project. They also operated the first U.S. Microgravity Payload (USMP) with French and American experiments. Veach was the primary Remote Manipulator System (RMS) operator on the mission, supporting the initial flight tests of the Canadian-built Space Vision System (SVS). STS-52 launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on October 22, 1992, and landed at Kennedy on November 1, 1992.

Lacy Veach died in Houston, Texas, on October 3, 1995, of cancer. He is interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.

<doc id="677130" wikidata="Q2376418" url="?curid=677130" title="Desuetude">
<text>In law, desuetude (; , ) is a doctrine that causes statutes, similar legislation, or legal principles to lapse and become unenforceable by a long habit of non-enforcement or lapse of time. It is what happens to laws that are not repealed when they become obsolete. It is the legal doctrine that long and continued non-use of a law renders it invalid, at least in the sense that courts will no longer tolerate punishing its transgressors.

The policy of inserting sunset clauses into a constitution or charter of rights (as in Canada since 1982) or into regulations and other delegated/subordinate legislation made under an act (as in Australia since the early 1990s) can be regarded as a statutory codification of this doctrine.

==English law==
The doctrine of desuetude has been diluted in the common law tradition. The doctrine went into decline from the Middle Ages, when the counter-notion became prevalent that enrolled bill rule existed: the king&#x27;s assent was required to nullify a clear or settled law; its second limb is similar, stating later acts and other legislation are to be preferred when conflicting. The non-preparatory, constitutional Bill of Rights 1689 clarified the fact of parliamentary supremacy over the executive and any directly conflicting case law. In 1818, the English court of King&#x27;s Bench held in the case of &quot;Ashford v Thornton&quot; that trial by combat remained available at a defendant&#x27;s option in a case where it was available under the common law. Parliament hastily enacted that such mortal combat was illegal; promotors and commentators cited morality including promoting the public good. Similarly the law of residential property distress and of attainder of estates had been little weakened despite widespread judicial displeasure before substantial, required reform via legislation.

==Scots law==
The doctrine exists in Scotland, being of the civil law tradition, where it can operate as a rare form of repeal. In Scotland, non-use is not the same as desuetude. Disuse must be accompanied by other identifiable provisions that would make the enforcement of the statute inconsistent: neglect over such a period of time that it would appear that a contrary custom had developed; and that a contrary practice had developed which is inconsistent with the law. Regarding the Scottish application, Lord McKay stated in &quot;Brown vs. Magistrates of Edinburgh&quot;:
==United States law==

Desuetude does not apply to requirements of the United States Constitution. In &quot;Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York&quot;, 397 U.S. 664, 678 (1970), the United States Supreme Court asserted that: &quot;It is obviously correct that no one acquires a vested or protected right in violation of the Constitution by long use, even when that span of time covers our entire national existence and indeed predates it.&quot;

It may, however, have validity as a doctrine in defense of penal prosecution. In 1825, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to enforce the traditional punishment of ducking for women convicted as common scolds, stating that &quot;total disuse of any civil institution for ages past, may afford just and rational objections against disrespected and superannuated ordinances.&quot; &quot;Wright v. Crane&quot;, 13 Serg. &amp; Rawle 220, 228 (Pa. 1825).

The seminal modern case under U.S. state law is a West Virginia opinion regarding desuetude, &quot;Committee on Legal Ethics v. Printz&quot;, 187 W.Va. 182, 416 S.E.2d 720 (1992). In that case, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held that penal statutes may become void under the doctrine of desuetude if:

# The statute proscribes only acts that are &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; (wrong because prohibited by statute) and not &quot;malum in se&quot; (intrinsically wrong);
# There has been open, notorious and pervasive violation of the statute for a long period; and 
# There has been a conspicuous policy of nonenforcement of the statute.

This holding was reaffirmed in 2003 in &quot;State ex rel. Canterbury v. Blake&quot;, 584 S.E.2d 512 (W. Va. 2003).

While it may not be a violation of due process to enforce a desuetudinal law, the fact that a law has long gone unenforced may present a bar to standing in a suit to prevent its future enforcement. In &quot;Poe v. Ullman&quot;, the Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to Connecticut&#x27;s ban on birth control, writing:

The undeviating policy of nullification by Connecticut of its anti-contraceptive laws throughout all the long years that they have been on the statute books bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis ... &quot;Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy ...&quot; – or not carrying it out – &quot;are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text.&quot;

Shortly thereafter, Connecticut&#x27;s birth control law was enforced, and struck down, in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;.

<doc id="677138" wikidata="Q448520" url="?curid=677138" title="Roberto Vittori">
<text>Brigadier Roberto Vittori, OMRI (born 15 October 1964, in Viterbo) is an Italian Air Force officer and an ESA astronaut. After graduating from the Italian Accademia Aeronautica in 1989, Vittori flew in the Italian Air Force. He then trained as a test pilot in the United States.

In 1998, Vittori was selected by the ESA to join the European Astronaut Corps. Since then, he has participated in three spaceflights: the Soyuz TM-34/33 and Soyuz TMA-6/5 taxi flights to the ISS, as well as STS-134, the penultimate mission of the American Space Shuttle Program in 2011. He was the last non-American to fly aboard the Shuttle.

== Career ==

Vittori graduated from the Italian Air Force Academy in 1989 and trained in the United States. He flew the Tornado in the Italian Air Force before graduating in 1995 from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Maryland where he was the first in his class. He served at the Italian Test Center as a project pilot for the development of the new European aircraft, the EF2000.
Vittori flew Tornado GR1 aircraft with the 155º Gruppo, 50° Stormo, in Piacenza, Italy from 1991 to 1994. During that time, he qualified for day/night air-to-air refuelling as well as a formation leader.
He has logged over 1700 hours in over 40 different aircraft including F-104, F-18, AMX, M-2000, G-222 and P-180.

In August 1998, after selection by ESA to join the European Astronaut Corps, he reported to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Following a period of training and evaluation, Vittori served in various technical assignments within the NASA Astronaut Office.

== Soyuz TM-34 ==
From April 25 to May 5, 2002, Vittori participated in the Soyuz TM-34 taxi-flight to the International Space Station (ISS), under an agreement between the Russian Rosaviakosmos, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), and the ESA. During his stay aboard ISS he worked alongside the resident crew overseeing four European scientific experiments. The mission successfully delivered a new &quot;lifeboat&quot; to the Station for use by resident crews in the event of an on-board emergency. Vittori returned to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-33.

== Soyuz TMA-6 ==
On 15 April 2005 Vittori participated in a second taxi-flight to the International Space Station (ISS), Soyuz TMA-6, returning to Earth on 24 April in the Soyuz TMA-5 capsule. He became the first European astronaut to visit the ISS twice and conducted experiments in upper limb fatigue in astronauts and germination of herbaceous plant seeds for possible space nutrition.

The astronaut also had a painting of the artist George Pusenkoff titled &quot;Single Mona Lisa (1:1)&quot; with him and took photos with it on the International Space Station. It is the ultimate continuation of the project &quot;Mona Lisa Travels&quot; developed by Pusenkoff and could only be realized under difficult conditions. The authorities found the idea good in theory, but constantly put forward new reasons why the project was unrealizable. Only when George Pusenkoff wrote to the then Italian ambassador in Russia, Gianfranco Facco Bonetti, the possibility of realizing the idea arose. The connection between science and art, which was also important in Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s life, found here an &quot;actualization&quot; in the form of this journey of an image of Mona Lisa into space. For the action, Pusenkoff&#x27;s painting was removed from the frame so that it could be rolled. On April 25, 2005, Vittori took the painting back to the Earth with him.

== STS-134 ==
Vittori was a mission specialist for NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-134 in 2011. He is the last non-US astronaut to have flown on the Shuttle.

== Personal life ==
Vittori has 3 sons.

While living in Washington, DC in 2015, Vittori was nearly single-handedly responsible for the rerouting of flight paths from Reagan National Airport over DC&#x27;s Ward 3 to other routes. As reported by WAMU, of the 8,760 complaints about Reagan National filed with the airports authority in 2015, 6,852 came from one household in DC&#x27;s Foxhall neighborhood (Vittori&#x27;s).

<text>Rex Joseph Walheim (born October 10, 1962) is a retired United States Air Force officer, engineer and NASA astronaut. He flew three Space Shuttle missions, STS-110, STS-122, and STS-135. Walheim logged over 566 hours in space, including 36 hours and 23 minutes of spacewalk (EVA) time. He was assigned as mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-135, the final Space Shuttle mission.

==Biography==
Walheim was born in Redwood City, California, but considers San Carlos, California, his hometown.

===Education===
Walheim graduated from San Carlos High School in 1980 and received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of California, Berkeley in 1984. He then received a Master of Science degree in industrial engineering from the University of Houston in 1989.

===Military career===
Walheim was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force in May 1984. In April 1985 he was assigned to Cavalier Air Force Station in Cavalier, North Dakota, where he worked as a missile warning operations crew commander. In October 1986, he was reassigned to the Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas, where he worked as a mechanical systems flight controller and was the lead operations engineer for the Space Shuttle landing gear, brakes, and emergency runway barrier.

Walheim was transferred to Headquarters Air Force Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in August 1989, where he was manager of a program upgrading missile warning radars. He was selected for USAF Test Pilot School in 1991, and attended the course at Edwards AFB in California in 1992. Following graduation, he was assigned to the F-16 Combined Test Force at Edwards where he was a project manager, and then commander of the avionics and armament flight. In January 1996, Walheim became an instructor at USAF Test Pilot School, where he served until he began astronaut training.

===NASA career===
Walheim served as a flight controller and operations engineer at the Johnson Space Center from October 1986 to January 1989. He was selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in March 1996 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Having completed two years of training and evaluation, he was qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. Initially, Walheim was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch. Walheim flew three flights, STS-110, STS-122 and STS-135, the final flight of the shuttle, logging over 566 hours in space, including over 36 hours and 23 minutes of EVA time. After his first flight, he was assigned to the EVA branch, where he served as the astronaut office representative for the Extra Vehicular Mobility Unit (the EVA spacesuit).

In September 2002, Walheim served as an aquanaut on the joint NASA-NOAA NEEMO 4 expedition (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations), an exploration research mission held in Aquarius, the world&#x27;s only undersea research laboratory, four miles off shore from Key Largo. Walheim and his crewmates spent five days saturation diving from the Aquarius habitat as a space analogue for working and training under extreme environmental conditions. The mission was delayed due to Hurricane Isadore, forcing National Undersea Research Center managers to shorten it to an underwater duration of five days. Then, three days into their underwater mission, the crew members were told that Tropical Storm Lili was headed in their direction and to prepare for an early departure from Aquarius.

<text>Nanayakkarapathirage Martin Perera, commonly known as Dr. N. M. Perera (Sinhala එන්.එම්.පෙරේරා ; 6 June 1904 – 14 August 1979), was one of the leaders of the Sri Lankan Trotskyist Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). He was the first Trotskyist to become a cabinet minister. He served two terms as Minister of Finance, another two as Leader of the Opposition, as well as one term as the Mayor of Colombo.

==Early life and education==
Born to Nanayakkarapathirage Abraham Perera, a rent collector at 36 St Joseph&#x27;s Street, in Grandpass, Colombo, and Johana Perera. He was the fifth of nine siblings, including five boys and four girls.

Perera started his schooling in the vernacular section of St. Joseph&#x27;s School, Grandpass and was later admitted to the English section. From there he spent a year at the Cathedral Boys&#x27; School, Mutwal a branch school of S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mutwal, then known as Cathedral Boys School, Mutwal. In 1919, he entered S. Thomas&#x27; College, Mount Lavinia and left in 1922 to join Ananda College. At Ananda he played cricket for the college team.

From 1922 to 1927, he studied at the University College, Colombo where he was a contemporary of J. R. Jayewardene, future president of Sri Lanka. Perera graduated with a BSc degree from the University of London External System. Thereafter he left for the United Kingdom, to enter the London School of Economics in 1927. He was in London from 1927 to 1933, where he studied under Professor Harold Laski, gaining his PhD with the thesis on the Constitution of the German Weimar Republic. This was followed by a further comparative study, of the Constitutions of the UK, United States, France and Germany; which gained him a DSc from the University of London. Perera was the first Ceylonese to gain a degree of Doctor of Science from the University of London.

==Formation of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party==
Perera returned to Ceylon in 1933. The work done by Perera (as a member of the Suriya-Mal Movement) in the Kegalle district during the malaria epidemic of 1934 and during the subsequent floods gained for him the support of the poor and caste-oppressed people of the area, who called him &quot;Parippu Mahathmaya&quot; after the dhal (or &quot;parippu&quot;) he distributed as relief supplies. In 1935 Perera was one of the founder members of the LSSP and played a leading role in the party&#x27;s Trotskyist activities between 1936 and 1940.

==State Council of Ceylon==
In 1936 he contested the Ruwanwella constituency, which at the time was the &quot;Thun Korale&quot; areas of Yatiyantota, Ruwanwella and Dereniyagala and parts of the present Galigamuwa electoral division, from the LSSP. His opponent was the incumbent Molamure Kumarihamy of the &quot;Meedeniya Walauwa&quot;, the feudal manor which had tremendous power over the poor people of the Sabaragamuwa area at the time. He was to hold this seat, or its Yatiyantota portion on division, continuously until 1977. Following his election, he and Philip Gunawardena, the other LSSP member of the State Council, used it as a platform voice the party&#x27;s policy and objectives for complete independence from Britten, where as the Ceylon National Congress was advocating self-rule. In 1937, he formed the Ratmalana Railway Workers&#x27; Union and was the LSSP delegate to the Indian National Congress session.

==Anti-war activity and imprisonment==
With the outbreak of World War II, the Board of Ministers declared its support to the British government. The LSSP opposed the move, claiming that it was an imperialist war and organized protest. In 1939, Perera formed the All-Ceylon Estate Workers&#x27; Union and lead a militant strike at Mooloya Plantation in January 1940. Perera and Gunawardana voted against the war budget in the State Council, On protests of the planters, the Governor of Ceylon declared LSSP activity against war effort as subversive and order the police to arrest the leaders of the LSSP. On 18 June 1940, N.M. Perera, Philip Gunawardena, and Colvin R de Silva were arrested by the police with Edmund Samarakkody being arrested the following day, but Leslie Goonewardene evaded arrest. The LSSP called for a gathering to protest the arrest and carried out a protest march which was dispersed by the police with a baton charge and followed by arrests. LSSP leaders were detained at the Welikada Prison but was later transferred to the Bogambara Prison after it was suspected that they were planning a hunger strike. On 5 April 1942 during the Easter Sunday Raid, Perera along with several other imprisoned LSSP members escaped from prison. He was smuggled into Bombay in July 1942 and worked with the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) in that country&#x27;s independence struggle. He was arrested in Bombay in July 1943 and was deported to Ceylon where he was sentenced to six months&#x27; rigorous imprisonment by the Magistrates Court of Kandy for prison escape and was imprisoned in Badulla for the duration of the war. He was released in 1945.

==Leader of the LSSP==
During the war the LSSP had several divisions. With the first taking place in 1940, with the split of the ro-Moscow fraction led by S. A. Wickremasinghe, M. G. Mendis, Pieter Keuneman and A. Vaidialingam. This was followed by a second slit over N. M. Perera and Philip Gunawardena opposition to merger into the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma, resulting in the formation the Workers&#x27; Opposition. After the war this faction, reconstructed the LSSP as an independent political party with N. M. Perera becoming its leader.

===Trade union activities===
Perera was the president of the All Ceylon United Motor Workers&#x27; Union, and the United Corporations and Mercantile Union the Ceylon Federation of Labour (CFL). He was appointed their chief negotiator by the striking workers during the 1946 general strike.

==Leader of the opposition (1947-1952)==
Having lost their seats in the State Council due to their imprisonment, the LSSP contested the 1947 general elections under the new constitution. N. M. Perera was elected from Ruwanwella and the LSSP gained the 28 seats in parliament, becoming the second largest representation, making Perera the Leader of the Opposition. He opposed the Ceylon Citizenship Act. On reunification with the Bolshevik Samasamaja Party (BSSP), he remained with the LSSP when the Viplavakari Lanka Sama Samaja Party (VLSSP) split off under Philip Gunawardena. He served as opposition leader until fresh elections were called in 1952. In the 1952 general elections, he was re-elected, but the LSSP became the second largest party in the opposition and S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike became the opposition leader.

==Mayor of Colombo==
In 1954, the LSSP won a string of local government elections which included nine Village Councils and three Urban Councils and the Colombo Municipal Council, where N. M. Perera was elected Mayor of Colombo, only non-United National Party-politician to win that office after 1945. He was Mayor for two years, before he was voted out of office on 28 February 1956 by the United National Party with the support of Ranasinghe Premadasa of the Ceylon Labour Party.

==Leader of the opposition (1956-1959)==
N. M. Perera contested the 1956 general elections, where the Sri Lanka Freedom Party of the Bandaranaike gained landslide victory over the United National Party which was reduced to eight seats in parliament. Once again N. M. Perera was elected leader of the opposition in parliament, a post he held until 1959. He was a strong opponent of the Official Language Act, and narrowly escaped death then a bomb was thrown on stage when he was addressing a crowd at the Old Town Hall.

==Split in the party==
He was re-elected in the 1960 March general election and the 1960 July general election from Yatiyantota and sat in the opposition. 
When LSSP was divided over possible government participation in the early 1960s, Perera was the principal leader of the wing that wanted to enter into government with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which led to LSSP&#x27;s expulsion from the Fourth International in 1964.

==Minister of Finance (1964)==
A short lived Coalition government was formed in 1964 known as the United Front and Perera was appointed Minister of Finance in it. He had to step down as minister when the United Front was defeated in the 1965 general elections and sat in the opposition having retained his seat in parliament.

==Minister of Finance==
He was reappointed as Minister of Finance in 1970, when the United Front won the 1970 general elections. He served as Minister of Finance from 10 May 1970 to 2 September 1975. Perera faced a budget deficit and first attempted to increase government tax revenue. In October 1970, he demonetized with the denominations of Rupees 50 and 100 to flush out black money. This failed to increase government tax revenue at the significant operational cost to the Central Bank. The 1971 Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Insurrection of left-wing youths to the leftist government by surprise and was almost toppled. He initiated a program of nationalization of private property and industries. It stunted both domestic and foreign investment in industry and development, unemployment and inflation remained unchecked. By 1974, the budget deficits of $195 million and Ceylon was facing a foreign exchange crisis. This was party due to global macro economic conditions of the such as the 1973 oil crisis as well as the results of government policies such as the Bandaranaike government&#x27;s attempts to centralise the economy and implement price controls which resulted in declining revenue from coconut, rubber and tea exports and increased food-importation costs. In September 1975, N. M. Perera and other LSSP ministers were removed by Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike. In the 1977 general elections, which the United National Party won with a total landslide of 5/6 of the seats, the LSSP like other leftist parties suffered a complete defeat and lost all of its seats. Perera lost his parliamentary seat in Yatiyantota.

==Later years==
From 1977 to 1978, he served as Chairman of the Board of Control of Cricket in Sri Lanka, and worked hard to obtain test status for Sri Lanka. In 1978, he represented Sri Lanka at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development as an adviser. He died on 14 August 1979 at the Colombo National Hospital following gall-bladder complication, aged 75 and his funeral gathered large crowds.

==Personal life==
He married fellow LSSP founding member and later party secretary, Selina Margaret Peiris on 6 March 1936. N. M. Perera was an avid cricket fan and a keen tennis player.

<text>Carl Erwin Walz (born 6 September 1955) is a retired NASA astronaut currently working for Orbital Sciences Corporation&#x27;s Advanced Programs Group as vice president for Human Space Flight Operations. Walz was formerly assigned to the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. He was the Acting Director for the Advanced Capabilities Division in the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, and was responsible for a broad range of activities to include Human Research, Technology Development, Nuclear Power and Propulsion and the Lunar Robotic Exploration Programs to support the Vision for Space Exploration.

== Personal life ==
Walz was born on September 6, 1955, in Cleveland, Ohio, and is married to the former Pamela J. Glady of Lyndhurst, Ohio. They have two children. He enjoys piano and vocal music, sports, and was notably the lead singer for Max Q, a rock-and-roll band composed of astronauts.

== Education ==
Graduated from Charles F. Brush High School, Lyndhurst, Ohio, in 1973; received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from Kent State University, Ohio, in 1977, and a Master of Science in solid state physics from John Carroll University, Ohio, in 1979.

== Organizations ==
American Legion, Kent State University Alumni Association, John Carroll University Alumni Association, and the Association of Space Explorers.

== Honors ==
Graduated summa cum laude from Kent State University. Awarded the Defense Superior Service Medal, the USAF Meritorious Service Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal with one Oak Leaf, the USAF Commendation Medal, and the USAF Achievement Medal with one Oak Leaf Cluster. Distinguished Graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School, Class 83A. Inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame. Awarded three NASA Space Flight Medals, NASA Exceptional Service Medal. Distinguished Alumnus Award, Kent State University, 1997.

== Experience ==
From 1979 to 1982, Walz was responsible for analysis of radioactive samples from the United States Atomic Energy Detection System at the 1155th Technical Operations Squadron, McClellan Air Force Base, California. The subsequent year was spent in study as a flight test engineer at the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, Edwards Air Force Base, California. From January 1984 to June 1987, Walz served as a Flight Test Engineer to the F-16 Combined Test Force at Edwards Air Force Base, where he worked on a variety of F-16C airframe avionics and armament development programs. From July 1987 to June 1990, he served as a Flight Test Manager at Detachment 3, Air Force Flight Test Center.

== NASA experience ==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Walz is a veteran of four space flights, and has logged 231 days in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), was the Orbiter flight engineer (MS-2) on STS-65 (1994), was a mission specialist on STS-79 (1996), and served as flight engineer on ISS Expedition 4 (2001–2002).

In 2008, Walz left NASA for private industry. Walz was the Vice President for Human Spaceflight Operations at Orbital Sciences Corporation in Dulles, Virginia, responsible for cargo and mission operations for Orbital&#x27;s Commercial Resupply Services program from 2008 to 2015. He then joined Oceaneering as Director Business Development.

=== Space flight experience ===
STS-51 &quot;Discovery&quot; (12–22 September 1993). During the mission, the five-member crew deployed the U.S. Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), and the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) with NASA and German scientific experiments aboard. Walz also participated in a 7-hour spacewalk (EVA) to evaluate tools for the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission. The mission was accomplished in 9 days, 22 hours, and 12 minutes.

STS-65 &quot;Columbia&quot; (8–23 July 1994). STS-65 flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2) Spacelab module and carried a crew of seven. During the 15-day flight, the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission completed 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles, setting a new flight duration record for the Shuttle program.

STS-79 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (16–26 September 1996). On STS-79 the six-member crew aboard Atlantis docked with the Russian Mir station, delivered food, water, U.S. scientific experiments and Russian equipment, and exchanged NASA long duration crewmembers. During the mission, the Atlantis/Mir complex set a record for docked mass in space. STS-79 was the first flight of the double Spacehab module and landed at KSC after 10 days 3 hours and 13 minutes.

The Expedition 4 crew launched on 5 December 2001, aboard STS-108 and docked with the International Space Station on 7 December 2001. During a 6½ month stay aboard the Space Station, the crew of three (two American astronauts and one Russian cosmonaut) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. Wearing the Russian Orlan space suit, Walz logged 11 hours and 52 minutes of EVA time in two separate spacewalks. The Expedition 4 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on 19 June 2002.

With the Expedition 4 mission, Astronauts Bursch and Walz set a new U.S. space endurance record of 195 days 16 hours 33 minutes when they beat the old mark of 188 days set by astronaut Shannon Lucid aboard the Russian Mir space station in 1996.

<doc id="677174" wikidata="Q765017" url="?curid=677174" title="Philadelphi Corridor">
<text>The Philadelphi Corridor, also called Philadelphi Route, is the Israeli code name for a narrow strip of land, some 100 metres wide and 14 km (8.7 miles) long, situated along the entirety of the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. 

Following Israel&#x27;s unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2005, the &quot;Philadelphi Accord&quot; with Egypt was concluded, which authorized Egypt to deploy 750 border guards along the route to patrol the border on Egypt&#x27;s side. The Palestinian side of the border was controlled by the Palestinian Authority until the 2007 takeover by Hamas. The joint authority for the Rafah Border Crossing was transferred to the Palestinian Authority and Egypt for restricted passage by Palestinian ID card holders, and by others by exception.

One purpose of the Philadelphi Route was to prevent the movement of illegal materials (including weapons and ammunition) and people between Egypt and the Gaza Strip.

==Background==
The 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty stipulated that the Israel-Egypt border would follow the border of Mandatory Palestine. The new border divided Rafah into two towns, one Palestinian and one Egyptian, separating families on both sides of the border. Following the October 2014 Sinai attacks, Egypt destroyed the Egyptian side of the city and had demolished at least 7,460 buildings by 2020.

==Philadelphi Accord==
In 2004, the Israeli Knesset approved a plan to unilaterally withdraw all Israeli citizens and military forces from the Gaza Strip, which went into force in August 2005. The disengagement plan defined the Philadelphi Corridor as &quot;The border area between the Gaza Strip and Egypt&quot;. The name Philadelphi was randomly chosen for the 9 mile-long corridor by the Israeli army.

On 1 September 2005, the &quot;Agreed Arrangements Regarding the Deployment of a Designated Force of Border Guards Along the Border in the Rafah Area&quot;, known as the Philadelphi Accord, was signed by Israel and Egypt. Under the accord, Egypt was authorized to deploy border guards along the route to patrol the border on Egypt&#x27;s side. The objective was to prevent smuggling of weapons from Egypt into the Gaza Strip, infiltration and other criminal activity. Egypt would also coordinate operations and share intelligence. Rafah Crossing would be the main border crossing with Gaza. The area near the border (known as Area C) would be a demilitarized zone, with Egypt only permitted to maintain police forces there.

The Accord contains 83 clauses and specifically describes the mission and obligations of the parties, including the specific types of machinery, weaponry and infrastructure permitted.

===Egyptian Border Guard Force===
The Philadelphi Accord created the Egyptian Border Guard Force (BGF) composed of 750 ground personnel divided between headquarters and four companies deployed along the route to patrol the border on Egypt&#x27;s side. The agreement specified that the Egyptian force is &quot;a designated force for the combating of terrorism and infiltration across the border&quot; and not intended for any military purposes.

Instead, it &quot;enhance[ed] Egypt&#x27;s capability to fight smuggling along the border,&quot; while ensuring that the forces would not serve any military purposes. Sentry posts, watchtowers and logistical facilities were permitted. Heavy armored vehicles, fortification, military-style intelligence-gathering equipment, and weaponry and equipment beyond the below numbers were prohibited. Israel insisted on the inclusion of provisions indicating that the Accord was not an amendment to the 1979 Peace Treaty. During negotiations Egypt attempted to frame the agreement toward the re-militarization of the Sinai and its borders with Israel and Gaza.

The BGF are equipped with the following:

* 500 assault rifles
* 67 light machine guns
* 27 light anti-personnel launchers
* ground radar
* 31 police-style vehicles
* 44 logistical and auxiliary vehicles

===Reaction===
For strategic reasons, the Israeli defense establishment opposed vacating the Philadelphi route. A primary concern was the threat to Israeli security from militarization of Gaza. However, Israel decided to vacate the corridor in order to prevent friction which could destabilize the region further.

The decision to withdraw from the Philadelphi Route also posed a threat to the neighboring Egyptians through the potential militarization of Gaza. It was feared that Israel&#x27;s departure would create a power vacuum that the weak Palestinian leadership would not be able to fill, thus creating a void to be filled by radical Islamists.
A number of scholars have looked into the legal issue of whether or not the Philadelphi Accord needed to be passed by the Knesset. Generally, the Knesset approves of major treaties either before or after their passage. The issue arose because the Philadelphi Accord would partially militarize Area D of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, changing the treaty and hence needing Knesset approval. This position was advocated by the Knesset&#x27;s Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chairperson, Yuval Steinitz; he was supported by MK Danny Yatom and they jointly filed a petition to the Supreme Court against the Government. Prime Minister Ariel Sharon on the other hand, argued that the treaty did not change the &quot;demilitarized&quot; status of Area C, and therefore was not a significant enough treaty that it needed to be ratified. On 6 July 2005, the Attorney General ruled that the government was not bound to seek Knesset approval for the treaty, but convention stipulated that it should.

== Rafah border crossing ==
Following the disengagement from Gaza, Israel signed with the Palestinian Authority the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA) on 15 November 2005. The Agreement allowed the opening of the Gaza-Egypt border for restricted passage of Palestinian residents, and the export of agricultural products from Gaza. The AMA also promised a link between Gaza and West Bank for buses and trucks, construction of a Gaza Seaport, discussion regarding a Gaza airport, and more freedom of movement within the West Bank. The Rafah Border Crossing was opened near Rafah on 25 November 2005, operated by the Palestinian Authority and US-sponsored Egypt, under supervision of EU observers. During the first six months of 2006, the crossing was opened nine and a half hours a day with an average of 650 people crossing daily each way, which was almost double the average prior to the AMA.

After Hamas kidnapped Gilad Shalit, the Rafah border was closed on 25 June 2006, although the incident did not happen in Rafah. Since then, the crossing was only irregularly opened for very limited cases. The border was never opened for the passage of goods. When Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in 2007, Egypt and Israel closed the borders with Gaza.

===Hamas control of Gaza===
In January 2008, Palestinian militants breached several parts of the wall bordering the town of Rafah. Thousands of Gazans flowed into Egypt in search of food and supplies. the Egyptian Army continued to destroy tunnels linking Egypt and Gaza and their security source said their demolition will continue &quot;in order to fight any element of terrorism.&quot;

After the fall of the Mubarak regime in 2011, Egypt relaxed restrictions at its border with the Gaza Strip, allowing more Palestinians to cross freely for the first time in four years. The Egyptian army continued to destroy Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels, according to the Egyptian army &quot;in order to fight any element of terrorism&quot;.

As of April 2013, Egypt reinforced its troops on the border with the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian Army destroyed tunnels by flooding them.

In October 2014, Egypt announced that they planned to expand the buffer zone between Gaza and Egypt, following a terrorist attack from Gaza that killed 31 Egyptian soldiers. Between July 2013 and August 2015, Egypt demolished 3,255 private houses on their side of the Egypt-Gaza border in order to create a buffer zone. By 2020, at least 7,460 buildings had been demolished.

===2023–present Gaza war===

The Rafah area was the site of active conflict in the Gaza war, including the border crossing which was at least partially closed due to military action.

On 11 December 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Security Committee that Israel will control the Philadelphi Corridor (border between Gaza and Egypt) and that Israel would impose a buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip. 

On 16 January 2024, the Egyptian government warned that any occupation of the Philadelphi Corridor by Israeli forces would be a violation of the 1978 Camp David Accords.

On 7 May 2024, Israel took control of the Rafah crossing and stationed its forces within the Philadelphi Corridor, violating the terms of the Camp David Accords. On 15 May, Israel asked Egypt to open its border so Gazan civilians who wished to, could flee across to Egypt.

The Middle East Monitor reported diplomatic sources said that on 19 August 2024, the Israeli government had asked to cancel the Philadelphi Accord during tripartite diplomatic talks in Cairo between Israel, Egypt and the US which were attempting to reach security understandings. Egypt was reported to have categorically rejected this request.

<doc id="677187" wikidata="Q539385" url="?curid=677187" title="Alfred Worden">
<text>Alfred Merrill Worden (February 7, 1932 – March 18, 2020) was an American test pilot, engineer and NASA astronaut who was command module pilot for the Apollo 15 lunar mission in 1971. One of 24 people to have flown to the Moon, he orbited it 74 times in the command module (CM) &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

Worden was born in Michigan in 1932; he spent his early years living on farms and attended the University of Michigan for one year, before securing an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Graduating in 1955, he elected to be commissioned in the United States Air Force, though he had no piloting experience. He proved adept at flying fighter planes, and honed his skills, becoming a test pilot before his selection as a Group 5 astronaut in 1966. He served on the support crew for Apollo 9 and the backup crew for Apollo 12 before his selection for the Apollo 15 crew in 1970, with David Scott as commander and James Irwin as lunar module pilot.

After Apollo 15 reached lunar orbit, and his crewmates departed to land on the Moon, Worden spent three days alone in the CM, becoming in the process the individual who traveled the farthest from any other human being, a distinction he still holds. He took many photographs of the Moon and operated a suite of scientific instruments that probed the Moon. During Apollo 15&#x27;s return flight to Earth, Worden performed an extravehicular activity (EVA), or spacewalk, to retrieve film cassettes from cameras on the exterior of the spacecraft. It was the first &quot;deep space&quot; EVA in history, and remains the one that has taken place farthest from Earth.

After their return, the crew became involved in a controversy over postal covers they had taken to the Moon; they were reprimanded by NASA and did not fly in space again. Worden remained at NASA until 1975 at the Ames Research Center, then entered the private sector. He engaged in a variety of business activities, and had a longtime involvement with the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, serving as chair of its board of directors from 2005 until 2011. He made many public appearances, promoting a renewed space program and education in the sciences, before his death in 2020.

== Early life and education ==
Alfred Merrill Worden was born February 7, 1932, in Jackson, Michigan, the son of Merrill Bangs Worden (1904–1978) and Helen Garnett Worden (; 1909–2004). The second of six children, and the oldest of the four boys, Alfred Merrill Worden lived on his family&#x27;s farm outside the city of Jackson, though the family stayed part of the time at his maternal grandparents&#x27; farm near East Jordan. Worden attended Dibble, Griswold, Bloomfield and East Jackson grade schools and graduated from Jackson High School, where he became the student council president. He was a Boy Scout and earned the rank of First Class Scout.

His family was not wealthy, so Worden sought a scholarship to enable his studies. He was able to secure one to the University of Michigan, but it was good for only one year. Seeing the U.S. service academies as his road to an education, Worden took an entrance examination and was offered appointments both to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, and to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland. He selected West Point and began his studies there in July 1951. Worden later stated, &quot;There was no way I was going to live the rest of my life on a farm. That kind of got me started down the path that led to NASA.&quot;

Worden came to like the demanding life at West Point, especially once he passed the initial stages of his military education and was given greater responsibility within the Corps of Cadets. In addition to his studies, he participated in cross country running, gymnastics and cheerleading. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in military science from West Point in 1955, finishing 47th out of 470 in his class.

== Military service ==
At the time Worden graduated from West Point, he had no piloting experience. The United States Air Force Academy was not yet graduating cadets, and would not until 1959. Graduates of West Point and Annapolis were permitted to choose to be commissioned in the Air Force, and some of Worden&#x27;s instructors urged this course upon him. He chose the Air Force, thinking promotion would be faster, something he subsequently learned was not the case.

Worden received primary flight training at Moore Air Force Base, Texas, where he learned to fly on Beechcraft T-34 trainer aircraft, coming to love piloting. Worden advanced for training at Laredo Air Force Base, Texas on Lockheed T-33 jet trainers, and after eight months went on to Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, for Air Defense Command training, flying F-86D Sabres. Worden first post-training assignment was with the 95th Fighter Interceptor Squadron at Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington, D.C., where he flew F-86Ds, and later, F-102 Delta Daggers. In addition to serving as a pilot there from March 1957 until May 1961, he was his squadron&#x27;s armament officer.

Seeking both to advance his career and to benefit the Air Force, Worden in 1961 asked to be sent to study aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan. He earned Master of Science degrees in aerospace engineering and instrumentation engineering from the University of Michigan in 1963.

After graduation, Worden applied for U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, but to his surprise, he was not selected. He learned that his superiors wanted him to be part of an exchange program with Britain&#x27;s Royal Air Force and be trained at the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School in Farnborough, England. Since that course would not begin for six months, Worden spent the time at the Randolph Air Force Base Instrument Pilots Instructor School. After successfully completing the course at Farnborough, second in his class, Worden returned to the U.S. He then served as an instructor at the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS), to which he was ordered at the specific request of its commandant, Colonel Chuck Yeager, and from which he graduated in September 1965.

== NASA career ==
=== Selection ===
In 1963, Worden put his name in for selection to NASA&#x27;s third group of astronauts but was told that though NASA was interested in him even without test pilot experience, he was ruled out by his pending orders to Farnborough, with which the agency could not interfere. Worden thought he would be beyond NASA&#x27;s age limit for new astronauts when next free to consider such a career option, and so believed he would never be an astronaut.
NASA&#x27;s recruitment for its fifth group of astronauts took place in 1965, at the same time the Air Force was seeking to recruit for its program, the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, with qualified pilots in the Air Force free to apply for either or both. Believing, as proved correct, that the Air Force program would never get off the ground, Worden chose to apply only to NASA, which he did in September 1965. Worden wrote in his first book of memoirs that &quot;professionally, I figured it couldn&#x27;t get any better than that. Even being a test pilot couldn&#x27;t compare with being an astronaut and making a spaceflight.&quot; Under the selection criteria, candidates had to be born on or after December 1, 1929, raising the age limit from 34 to 36. Worden, aged 34 when selected, was one of the 19 candidates chosen by NASA in April 1966, together with his ARPS classmates Stuart Roosa and Charles Duke; four others were previous graduates.

Having been urged by NASA superiors to have plenty of astronauts available for the many hoped-for Apollo and Apollo Applications missions, Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton, the astronauts&#x27; supervisor, hired all the Group5 candidates he considered qualified. Budget cuts and the diversion of funds to other programs meant there would be relatively few flights, and Worden perceived some resentment at the new intake from more senior astronauts as the competition for spots on Apollo missions intensified.

=== Early assignments ===
On October 3, 1966, Chief Astronaut Alan Shepard assigned Worden and four other Group5 selectees, Ken Mattingly, Jack Swigert, Ronald Evans and Vance Brand, to the astronaut team dealing with the BlockII command module (CM), headed by Pete Conrad. The BlockI command modules were intended only for Apollo&#x27;s initial Earth-orbit flights, and in fact never flew in space on a crewed mission; the BlockII modules would go to lunar orbit. The following month, Worden was assigned as part of the support crew for the second crewed Apollo mission, along with Fred Haise and Edgar Mitchell. Apollo support crews were to do the things that the prime and backup crews did not have time for. Worden took the assignment as an indication that NASA management, including Slayton, was pleased with him.

Worden was at North American Aviation&#x27;s plant in Downey, California, where the BlockII command module was being built, on January 27, 1967, when he received an urgent phone call from Slayton, informing him that all three Apollo 1 astronauts had been killed in a fire at the launch pad, where a test was under way. Worden informed the other astronauts on-site and they flew back to Houston. He was especially saddened by the fact that the three accomplished pilots who were to make up the first Apollo space crew died on the ground, rather than flying. During the complete safety review that followed, Worden spent much of his time in Downey working on the BlockII CM, seeking (with other CM specialists such as Swigert) to remove potential combustibles and other hazards. After the pause, he remained on the support crew for the second Apollo mission, which was to include testing of the CM and Lunar Module (LM) in Earth orbit.

This mission was initially designated Apollo 8. There were delays in the development of the LM and in August 1968, NASA official George Low proposed that if Apollo 7 in October went well, Apollo8 should go to lunar orbit without a LM, so as not to hold up the program. The Earth-orbit test would become Apollo 9. The crew who had been scheduled for Apollo8, led by Jim McDivitt, became the Apollo9 crew, and Worden became part of that mission&#x27;s support crew along with Mitchell and Jack Lousma.

Worden was named as backup command module pilot (CMP) for the Apollo 12 flight. Apollo9&#x27;s CMP had been David Scott, who became, by the normal rotation of crews instituted by Slayton, the backup commander of Apollo12 and the prospective commander of Apollo 15, with Worden likely to be the CMP of Apollo15&#x27;s prime crew. Jim Irwin was named backup lunar module pilot (LMP) for Apollo12, with similar prospects of flying on Apollo15. Slayton, in his memoirs, mentioned that Worden had been on the support crew for Apollo9, and deemed him a &quot;logical choice&quot;. Worden wrote in his own autobiography that he and Irwin had learned of their selection for Apollo12 at a meeting in Scott&#x27;s office.
As Apollo 12&#x27;s backup command module pilot, Worden forged a close, lifelong friendship with the prime crew&#x27;s CMP, Dick Gordon, with whom he trained. Worden remembered, &quot;Dick was my buddy. We flew together and worked together for a year and a half when he was training for Apollo12 and I was his backup. We just went everywhere together. We worked really hard but it was also a lot of fun.&quot; Gordon and Worden learned navigational techniques for space so that if communications with Mission Control failed, the CMP could bring the craft home. Worden remembered that the Apollo12 prime crew, led by Pete Conrad, had a close bond and drove matching black and gold Chevrolet Corvettes at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). In reaction, the backup crew secured a red one for Irwin, white for Worden, and a blue car for Scott, both emphasizing their individuality within the crew and making them less conspicuous at times when they did not want to be recognized as astronauts, especially since the three cars were rarely seen together.

=== Apollo 15 ===
==== Preparation and launch ====
Scott, Worden, and Irwin were publicly named as the crew of Apollo15 on March 26, 1970. Apollo15 was originally scheduled to be an H mission, with a limited stay of 33 hours on the Moon and two moonwalks, but the cancellation of two Apollo missions in mid-1970 meant the flight would be a Jmission, with three moonwalks during its three-day stay, the first Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), and in the service module (SM) a suite of scientific instruments to probe the Moon. It was Worden&#x27;s job, as his crewmates walked on the Moon, to operate these devices. For the first time, observations from lunar orbit were made a formal mission objective, and, like the CMPs of Apollo 13 and Apollo 14, Worden worked with geologist Farouk El-Baz during training, learning to interpret what he saw as he flew over the mountains and deserts of the western United States. Worden found El-Baz to be an enjoyable and inspiring teacher. He also accompanied his crewmates on geology training which took them to places where they walked over terrain resembling the Moon&#x27;s, including sites in Hawaii, Mexico, and Iceland. He trained for the possibility he might have to return without Scott and Irwin or rescue them if the LM launched into the wrong orbit. When he was not busy with that or other training, Worden spent much of his time at North American Rockwell&#x27;s facilities at Downey, supervising the construction and testing of Apollo15&#x27;s command and service module (CSM).

Before leaving on his mission, Worden appeared on the children&#x27;s television show &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot;. He felt NASA needed to do more to engage children, members of a generation whose support would one day be necessary for the space program. Fred Rogers was planning to do shows on parents going away on trips, and felt Worden&#x27;s appearance would mesh well with that. Worden appeared on the show before going to the Moon and answered several children&#x27;s questions: he wrote down some others and took them with him on the spacecraft, promising to think about them on the trip, and after the mission, appeared again on the program to answer them.

Apollo 15 took off on its lunar journey from KSC on July 26, 1971. Once trans-lunar injection had been achieved, placing the spacecraft on a trajectory towards the Moon, explosive cords separated the CSM, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, from the booster as Worden operated the CSM&#x27;s thrusters to push it away. Worden then maneuvered the CSM to dock with the LM, &quot;Falcon&quot;, which was mounted on the end of the S-IVB (the booster that had supplied the thrust for TLI), and the combined craft was then separated from the S-IVB by explosives.

==== Lunar orbit ====
After the mission arrived in lunar orbit, Scott and Irwin entered &quot;Falcon&quot; while Worden remained in &quot;Endeavour&quot;. When the two craft failed to separate to allow &quot;Falcon&quot; and its crew to prepare for the Moon landing, Worden went into the docking tunnel and reconnected a loose umbilical, fixing the problem. Worden, in &quot;Endeavour&quot;, was able to listen as Scott and Irwin descended toward and landed on the Moon, but was unable to spot &quot;Falcon&quot; until a later orbit, though he passed over the targeted site at the moment of planned landing. He had executed a burn of the CSM&#x27;s main engine, the Service Propulsion System, to send &quot;Endeavour&quot; from the lower orbit in which the two craft separated, to an orbit of by in preparation for his scientific work.

Worden began what amounted to a separate mission from his crewmates, with a separate CAPCOM and mission controllers. His main tasks while alone in lunar orbit were photography, and operating the instruments in the SIM bay. Filling previously unused space in the service module, the SIM bay contained a gamma-ray spectrometer, mounted on the end of a boom, an X-ray spectrometer and a laser altimeter, which failed part way through the mission. A stellar camera and a metric camera together comprised the mapping camera, which was complemented by a panoramic camera, derived from the long-classified Corona spy technology. Also present were an alpha particle spectrometer, which could be used to detect evidence of lunar volcanism, and a mass spectrometer, also on a boom in the hope it would be unaffected by contamination from the ship. He supplemented the photographs with verbal descriptions; &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; inclined orbit caused it to pass over features never seen before in detail as Worden watched. Each time &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; orbit passed from the far side of the Moon to a view of the Earth and renewed communications with Mission Control, Worden greeted it with the words, &quot;Hello, Earth. Greetings from &quot;Endeavour&quot;&quot;, expressed in different languages. Worden and El-Baz had come up with the idea, and had collaborated on translations.

Busy as he was, he still had time to savor the experience. Knowing he was unlikely to come back to the Moon, Worden was determined to absorb the entire experience. He did not need all the rest periods for sleep, and spent part of that time in contemplation of what was outside his craft, and what it all meant. Through &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s windows, he watched the Moon, the Earth, and the starshe could see many more stars, and more intensely, than Earthbound observers. He concluded it was naive to believe Earth had the only life in the universe, and he wondered if space exploration was part of humanity&#x27;s survival instinct to avoid being trapped in a single solar system.

Worden has been listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the &quot;most isolated human being&quot; during his time alone in &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Orbiting the Moon alone, he was at his greatest distance from Scott and Irwin in &quot;Falcon&quot;, away from any other human beings. He later stated he enjoyed his &quot;three wonderful days in a spacecraft all by myself&quot;, and that he was used to being alone as a fighter pilot. Worden remembered, &quot;On the back side of the Moon, I didn&#x27;t even have to talk to Houston and that was the best part of the flight.&quot;

==== Return ====
As &quot;Falcon&quot; took off from the Moon, Worden played a recording of the Air Force Song (&quot;Off we go, into the wild blue yonder&quot;), intending it to be heard only in Mission Control; somewhat to his chagrin, it was relayed to the LM, to the annoyance of Scott. Worden piloted the CSM as Scott maneuvered the LM, bringing them together in a direct rendezvous, on the first lunar orbit, the second time a first-orbit rendezvous had been accomplished (after Apollo14).

&quot;Endeavour&quot; completed 74 lunar orbits prior to trans-Earth injection (TEI), the burn to take the astronauts home. On the way back to Earth, Worden did a spacewalk to retrieve film from the spacecraft&#x27;s cameras. He took 38 minutes in extravehicular activity (EVA) outside &quot;Endeavour&quot; to accomplish this, three times venturing from outside the hatch to the exterior of the SIM bay of the SM. In retrieving the film cassettes from the panoramic and mapping cameras, Worden performed the first deep-space EVA, and reported his personal observations of the general condition of equipment housed there. Worden remains, , the record-holder for the spacewalk performed furthest from Earth. Apollo15 concluded with a Pacific splashdown and subsequent recovery by the amphibious assault ship USS &quot;Okinawa&quot;. In completing his flight, Worden logged 295 hours and 11 minutes in space.

=== Covers incident ===
The crew had, before the mission, agreed with an acquaintance named Horst Eiermann, who was working on behalf of a West German stamp dealer, Hermann Sieger, to carry 100 postal covers to the Moon in exchange for approximately $7,000 to each astronaut. The astronauts added 100 more for each crew member, though two covers were unaccounted for, leading to a total of 398. These were carried aboard &quot;Endeavour&quot; prior to launch by Scott in his spacesuit&#x27;s pocket, were transferred into &quot;Falcon&quot; and spent three days on the lunar surface inside the lander. After the return, 100 covers were sent to Eiermann in West Germany, and the astronauts received the agreed payments. NASA rules required that personal items carried aboard Apollo flights be manifested for weight and other reasons and approved by Slayton; this was not done. The astronauts stated their intent had been to set up trust funds for their children, and that they intended that the covers not be sold or otherwise publicized until the Apollo program was over and they had left NASA and the Air Force. Astronauts were forbidden by standards of conduct issued in 1967 from using their position for financial gain for themselves or other people.

In addition to the 398 carried by Scott, Worden took 144 covers into space, at the instigation of F. Herrick Herrick, a retired movie director and a stamp collector. These had, as required, been approved by Slayton, who did not ask where Worden had gotten them. After the flight Worden sent 100 of them to Herrick, who sold some. These sales prompted an inquiry to NASA, alerting Slayton, who warned Worden to avoid further commercialization. Worden wrote an angry letter to Herrick, stating that the sales were putting his career at risk.
The 100 covers Scott sent to West Germany were put on sale to Sieger&#x27;s customers in late 1971 at a price of about $1,500 each. After receiving the agreed payments, the astronauts returned them, and in the end, took no compensation. Slayton heard about the Sieger covers, and he spoke with Worden and Irwin; both referred him to Scott. Slayton, knowing Worden was a stamp collector, became suspicious that he had arranged both deals, and this led to repeated phone calls asking for details. In April 1972, Slayton met with Scott and Worden and learned from them that unauthorized covers had been flown. Worden remembered what hurt the most about that meeting was having disappointed Slayton, a man he greatly admired.

The Apollo 15 crew had been recycled as the backup crew for Apollo 17, the final Apollo mission, as using fully-trained astronauts was easier than training a fresh backup crew who would have no prospect of being the prime crew on a later lunar Apollo mission. But in May 1972, as Worden remembered, Slayton called him while Worden was preparing for geological training, instructing him to clear out his office and go back to the Air Force. Slayton had prevailed on Irwin to retire, letting NASA assign a new backup crew. Worden did not clear out his office but began looking into ways of staying at NASA, even if outside the Astronaut Corps. Slayton said at the time that he had to reduce the number of astronauts, that Irwin and Mitchell were eligible for retirement from the military, and the astronaut he could most easily do without after that was Worden; the postal covers incident had played a part in that determination.

The matter became public in June 1972 and the three astronauts were reprimanded for poor judgment on July 10. Concerned about commercialization of Apollo15, the Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences set a hearing for August 3, 1972; among those who testified were the astronauts, Slayton, NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher and Deputy Administrator George Low. Slayton wrote of the astronauts&#x27; testimony, &quot;they came clean and took their lumps but I was still pretty pissed off about it.&quot;

This still left Worden trying to find a job at NASA; he testified before the committee that he had been told he could stay if he came to an agreement with whoever he was to work for. He found an ally in Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight Dale D. Myers, who helped Worden get a position at the Ames Research Center in California. According to Low, NASA was aware that the reprimands made the astronauts essentially unpromotable in the Air Force, which would not have jobs for them worth their abilities, and it was decided that though the crew was removed from flight status, they would be given positions elsewhere in NASA. At Ames, Worden served as a Senior Aerospace Scientist, and from 1973 to 1975, chief of the Systems Study Division. He retired from NASA and the Air Force, with the rank of colonel, in 1975.

In his first book of memoirs, Worden took responsibility for making &quot;a decision that fucked up my life completely, utterly, and irreversibly&quot;, but felt Scott did not take enough of the blame on himself. In a second book, published posthumously in 2021, Worden expressed his belief that Slayton would not have fired him from the Astronaut Corps if given the chance, but that Slayton&#x27;s superior, Christopher C. Kraft, wanted him fired. Apollo 10 commander Thomas P. Stafford wrote an epilogue to Worden&#x27;s first book and stated, &quot;Al should not have his efforts degraded by the decades-old, short-lived publicity surrounding some postal covers carried on board.&quot; Worden later stated, &quot;We probably didn&#x27;t do the smartest thing in the world, but we didn&#x27;t do anything that was illegal. We didn&#x27;t do anything that anybody else hadn&#x27;t done, but the consequences were rather severe to us.&quot;

== Post-NASA activities ==

After leaving the Air Force and NASA, Worden founded Alfred M. Worden, Inc., then served as the director of Energy Management Programs at the Northwood Institute in Midland, Michigan. In 1982, Worden ran for the United States House of Representatives in Florida&#x27;s 12th congressional district but lost the Republican primary to state senator Tom Lewis. Despite the loss, Worden referred to his run as the high point of his life, &quot;I thought that was a very important thing to do. I put everything into it and lost, but that is okay.&quot;

The Apollo 15 astronauts had been required to turn in, and NASA had retained, 298 of the postal covers carried aboard by Scott, as well as 61 more envelopes from the deal with Herrick; they were transferred to the National Archives in August 1973. It had been Worden&#x27;s understanding that the covers would be returned once NASA&#x27;s investigation was over, and in 1983 he sued the government. Believing it could not win, the government returned the covers and the 298 were divided by the three astronauts. Worden sold some of them to pay debts from his unsuccessful run for Congress.

Worden still believed other former astronauts looked at him askance because of the postal covers incident. In 1984, he began to involve himself with the Mercury Seven Foundation, set up by the original astronauts to provide scholarships for promising students in the sciences. Worden was at the time living near KSC and as the Mercury Seven aged, he and other later astronauts took on greater responsibilities. The organization&#x27;s name was changed to the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation, and in 2005, Worden was elected to chair its board of directors. He served in that capacity until 2011.
Worden held executive positions with Jet Electronics and Technology, Inc., and with B.F. Goodrich prior to his retirement from the business world in 1996. In 2011, Worden&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Falling to Earth: An Apollo15 Astronaut&#x27;s Journey to the Moon&quot; made the top 12 of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Bestseller list. He also wrote &quot;Hello Earth: Greetings from Endeavour&quot; (1974), a collection of poetry, in 1974, and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;I Want to Know About a Flight to the Moon&quot; (1974).

Widely known as &quot;Al&quot;, Worden made many public appearances, and was one of the most approachable of the former astronauts, ready to chat over a vodka on the rocks. In 2018, Worden joined the Back to Space organization as an Astronaut Consultant with the goal of using film to inspire the next generation to go to Mars. Worden was a technical consultant to the 2018 film &quot;First Man&quot;, a biopic of Apollo 11&#x27;s Neil Armstrong. 2019 saw the establishment of the Astronaut Al Worden Endeavour Scholarship to send &quot;aspiring young space explorers&quot; and their teachers to U.S. Space Camp in Alabama.

== Awards and honors ==
Worden received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1971. He entered the International Space Hall of Fame in 1983. He was inducted into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 1997. In 2009, Worden was honored with the NASA Ambassador of Exploration Award. He was inducted in 2016 into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

Worden and the other Apollo 15 crew members received the first United Nations Peace Medal in 1971. They also received the Robert J. Collier Trophy (1971), the Kitty Hawk Memorial Award (1971) and the AIAA Haley Astronautics Award (1972). He received an Honorary Doctor of Science degree in Astronautical Engineering from the University of Michigan in 1971.

== Personal life and popular culture ==
Worden married Pamela Vander Beek, whom he met on a blind date while a cadet, in June 1955. The couple divorced in December 1969, just before Worden was selected to fly on Apollo15. Worden became the first astronaut to divorce during the program and thereafter fly in space. Al and Pamela Worden lived across the street from each other following the separation, and he remained involved in their daughters&#x27; lives. He was initially shunned by the Astronaut Wives Club but in time this ended.

In September 1974 he married Sandra Lee Wilder; they divorced in January 1980. Worden married Jill Lee Hotchkiss in July 1982. She died in May 2014. He had two daughters with Pamela Worden, Merrill and Alison, and one stepdaughter, Tamara, from his third marriage. Worden&#x27;s recreational interests included bowling, water skiing, golf, racquetball and playing the piano.

In the 1998 HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; Worden was played by Michael Raynor.

== Death ==
Alfred Worden died on March 18, 2020, at an assisted living center in Sugar Land, Texas. He was 88 years old. Worden had been suffering from an infection at home in League City, Texas for which he was hospitalized at Texas Medical Center in Houston. He was convalescing at the Sugar Land facility at the time of his death.

The tributes to Worden upon his death were many. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stated, &quot;Al was an American hero whose achievements in space and on Earth will never be forgotten.&quot; Apollo11&#x27;s Buzz Aldrin, a fellow West Point graduate, tweeted, &quot;&#x27;Line of Grey, Be Thou at Peace!&#x27; Godspeed Al.&quot; Tom Kallman, president of Kallman Worldwide, Inc., with whom Worden had worked in setting up the Astronaut Al Worden Endeavour Scholarship Foundation, noted, &quot;Though he was focused on STEM, Al&#x27;s principal message was always to &#x27;follow your passion, wherever that leads you&#x27;.&quot; Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States, stated, &quot;We stand on the shoulders of space pioneers like Al, and America will always marvel at his achievements and look to him for inspiration as we strive to go farther and faster than ever before.&quot;

A celebration of Worden&#x27;s life took place on September 19, 2020. This was originally to be a hybrid in-person/online event, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic was postponed and made online only. Those paying tribute to Worden included fellow Group 5 astronauts Duke, Haise and Jack Lousma.

<doc id="677189" wikidata="Q5403421" url="?curid=677189" title="Ethical pot">
<text>The term &quot;ethical pot&quot; was coined by Oliver Watson in his book &quot;Studio Pottery: Twentieth Century British Ceramics in the Victoria and Albert Museum&quot; to describe a 20th-century trend in studio pottery that favoured plain, utilitarian ceramics. Watson said that the ethical pot, &quot;lovingly made in the correct way and with the correct attitude, would contain a spiritual and moral dimension.&quot; Its leading proponents were Bernard Leach and a more controversial group of post-war British studio potters. They were theoretically opposed to the &quot;expressive pots&quot; or &quot;fine art pots&quot; of potters such as William Staite Murray, Lucie Rie and Hans Coper.

The &quot;ethical pot&quot; theory and style was popularized by Bernard Leach in &quot;A Potter&#x27;s Book&quot; (1940). He expanded the theories that ethical pots should be utilitarian, &quot;naturally shaped&quot; and originally as conceived should derive from &quot;Oriental forms that transcended mere good looks.&quot; Leach had previously spent considerable time in Japan studying eastern crafts and mingei. His ethical pot idea was a rough interpretation of mingei for the western world; he advocated simplicity (ideally the best pots are so quick to make that they could be &quot;thrown before breakfast&quot;), and pots made to look natural and hand crafted. Soetsu Yanagi, a leading figure in the mingei movement, said that a craft object &quot;must be made by an anonymous craftsman or woman and therefore unsigned; it must be functional, simple, and have no excess ornamentation; it must be one of many similar pieces and must be inexpensive; it must be unsophisticated; it must reflect the region it was made in; and it must be made by hand.&quot;

According to ceramic art critics of today, this pot style was intended to be modernist, useful, and &quot;democratic in usage&quot; as opposed to the &quot;fine art pot&quot; and also opposed to industrial art.

==Potters in the movement==
The potters apprenticed to Bernard Leach include: Michael Cardew, Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie, Norah Braden, David Leach and Michael Leach (his sons), William Marshall, Kenneth Quick and Richard Batterham. His American apprentices included: Warren MacKenzie, Byron Temple, Clary Illian and Jeff Oestrich. He was a major influence on the leading New Zealand potter Len Castle, and they had worked together in the mid-1950s. Through his son David, Bernard was the main influence on the work of the Australian potter Ian Sprague.

<doc id="677191" wikidata="Q5130428" url="?curid=677191" title="Differential (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, differential refers to several related notions derived from the early days of calculus, put on a rigorous footing, such as infinitesimal differences and the derivatives of functions.

The term is used in various branches of mathematics such as calculus, differential geometry, algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.

== Introduction ==

The term differential is used nonrigorously in calculus to refer to an infinitesimal (&quot;infinitely small&quot;) change in some varying quantity. For example, if &quot;x&quot; is a variable, then a change in the value of &quot;x&quot; is often denoted Δ&quot;x&quot; (pronounced &quot;delta x&quot;). The differential &quot;dx&quot; represents an infinitely small change in the variable &quot;x&quot;. The idea of an infinitely small or infinitely slow change is, intuitively, extremely useful, and there are a number of ways to make the notion mathematically precise.

Using calculus, it is possible to relate the infinitely small changes of various variables to each other mathematically using derivatives. If &quot;y&quot; is a function of &quot;x&quot;, then the differential &quot;dy&quot; of &quot;y&quot; is related to &quot;dx&quot; by the formula
formula_1
where formula_2denotes not &#x27;dy divided by dx&#x27; as one would intuitively read, but &#x27;the derivative of &quot;y&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; &#x27;. This formula summarizes the idea that the derivative of &quot;y&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; is the limit of the ratio of differences Δ&quot;y&quot;/Δ&quot;x&quot; as Δ&quot;x&quot; approaches zero.

=== Basic notions ===

* In calculus, the differential represents a change in the linearization of a function.
** The total differential is its generalization for functions of multiple variables.
* In traditional approaches to calculus, differentials (e.g. &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;, &quot;dt&quot;, etc.) are interpreted as infinitesimals. There are several methods of defining infinitesimals rigorously, but it is sufficient to say that an infinitesimal number is smaller in absolute value than any positive real number, just as an infinitely large number is larger than any real number.
* The differential is another name for the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of a function from R&quot;n&quot; to R&quot;m&quot; (especially when this matrix is viewed as a linear map).
* More generally, the differential or &quot;pushforward&quot; refers to the derivative of a map between smooth manifolds and the pushforward operations it defines. The differential is also used to define the dual concept of pullback.
* Stochastic calculus provides a notion of stochastic differential and an associated calculus for stochastic processes.
* The integrator in a Stieltjes integral is represented as the differential of a function. Formally, the differential appearing under the integral behaves exactly as a differential: thus, the integration by substitution and integration by parts formulae for Stieltjes integral correspond, respectively, to the chain rule and product rule for the differential.

== History and usage ==
Infinitesimal quantities played a significant role in the development of calculus. Archimedes used them, even though he did not believe that arguments involving infinitesimals were rigorous. Isaac Newton referred to them as fluxions. However, it was Gottfried Leibniz who coined the term &quot;differentials&quot; for infinitesimal quantities and introduced the notation for them which is still used today.

In Leibniz&#x27;s notation, if &quot;x&quot; is a variable quantity, then &quot;dx&quot; denotes an infinitesimal change in the variable &quot;x&quot;. Thus, if &quot;y&quot; is a function of &quot;x&quot;, then the derivative of &quot;y&quot; with respect to &quot;x&quot; is often denoted &quot;dy&quot;/&quot;dx&quot;, which would otherwise be denoted (in the notation of Newton or Lagrange) &quot;ẏ&quot; or &quot;y&quot;. The use of differentials in this form attracted much criticism, for instance in the famous pamphlet The Analyst by Bishop Berkeley. Nevertheless, the notation has remained popular because it suggests strongly the idea that the derivative of &quot;y&quot; at &quot;x&quot; is its instantaneous rate of change (the slope of the graph&#x27;s tangent line), which may be obtained by taking the limit of the ratio Δ&quot;y&quot;/Δ&quot;x&quot; as Δ&quot;x&quot; becomes arbitrarily small. Differentials are also compatible with dimensional analysis, where a differential such as &quot;dx&quot; has the same dimensions as the variable &quot;x&quot;.
Calculus evolved into a distinct branch of mathematics during the 17th century CE, although there were antecedents going back to antiquity. The presentations of, e.g., Newton, Leibniz, were marked by non-rigorous definitions of terms like differential, fluent and &quot;infinitely small&quot;. While many of the arguments in Bishop Berkeley&#x27;s 1734 The Analyst are theological in nature, modern mathematicians acknowledge the validity of his argument against &quot;the Ghosts of departed Quantities&quot;; however, the modern approaches do not have the same technical issues. Despite the lack of rigor, immense progress was made in the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 19th century, Cauchy and others gradually developed the Epsilon, delta approach to continuity, limits and derivatives, giving a solid conceptual foundation for calculus.
In the 20th century, several new concepts in, e.g., multivariable calculus, differential geometry, seemed to encapsulate the intent of the old terms, especially &quot;differential&quot;; both differential and infinitesimal are used with new, more rigorous, meanings.

Differentials are also used in the notation for integrals because an integral can be regarded as an infinite sum of infinitesimal quantities: the area under a graph is obtained by subdividing the graph into infinitely thin strips and summing their areas. In an expression such as
formula_3
the integral sign (which is a modified long s) denotes the infinite sum, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) denotes the &quot;height&quot; of a thin strip, and the differential &quot;dx&quot; denotes its infinitely thin width.

== Approaches ==
There are several approaches for making the notion of differentials mathematically precise.
# Differentials as linear maps. This approach underlies the definition of the derivative and the exterior derivative in differential geometry.
# Differentials as nilpotent elements of commutative rings. This approach is popular in algebraic geometry.
# Differentials in smooth models of set theory. This approach is known as synthetic differential geometry or smooth infinitesimal analysis and is closely related to the algebraic geometric approach, except that ideas from topos theory are used to &quot;hide&quot; the mechanisms by which nilpotent infinitesimals are introduced.
# Differentials as infinitesimals in hyperreal number systems, which are extensions of the real numbers that contain invertible infinitesimals and infinitely large numbers. This is the approach of nonstandard analysis pioneered by Abraham Robinson.

These approaches are very different from each other, but they have in common the idea of being &quot;quantitative&quot;, i.e., saying not just that a differential is infinitely small, but &quot;how&quot; small it is.

=== Differentials as linear maps ===
There is a simple way to make precise sense of differentials, first used on the Real line by regarding them as linear maps. It can be used on formula_4, formula_5, a Hilbert space, a Banach space, or more generally, a topological vector space. The case of the Real line is the easiest to explain. This type of differential is also known as a covariant vector or cotangent vector, depending on context.

==== Differentials as linear maps on R ====

Suppose formula_6 is a real-valued function on formula_4. We can reinterpret the variable formula_8 in formula_6 as being a function rather than a number, namely the identity map on the real line, which takes a real number formula_10 to itself: formula_11. Then formula_6 is the composite of formula_13 with formula_8, whose value at formula_10 is formula_16. The differential formula_17 (which of course depends on formula_13) is then a function whose value at formula_10 (usually denoted formula_20) is not a number, but a linear map from formula_4 to formula_4. Since a linear map from formula_4 to formula_4 is given by a formula_25 matrix, it is essentially the same thing as a number, but the change in the point of view allows us to think of formula_20 as an infinitesimal and &quot;compare&quot; it with the &quot;standard infinitesimal&quot; formula_27, which is again just the identity map from formula_4 to formula_4 (a formula_25 matrix with entry formula_31). The identity map has the property that if formula_32 is very small, then formula_33 is very small, which enables us to regard it as infinitesimal. The differential formula_20 has the same property, because it is just a multiple of formula_27, and this multiple is the derivative formula_36 by definition. We therefore obtain that formula_37, and hence formula_38. Thus we recover the idea that formula_39 is the ratio of the differentials formula_40 and formula_41.

This would just be a trick were it not for the fact that:
# it captures the idea of the derivative of formula_13 at formula_10 as the &quot;best linear approximation&quot; to formula_13 at formula_10;
# it has many generalizations.

==== Differentials as linear maps on Rn ====

If formula_13 is a function from formula_5 to formula_4, then we say that formula_13 is &quot;differentiable&quot; at formula_50 if there is a linear map formula_20 from formula_5 to formula_4 such that for any formula_54, there is a neighbourhood formula_55 of formula_10 such that for formula_57,
formula_58

We can now use the same trick as in the one-dimensional case and think of the expression formula_59 as the composite of formula_13 with the standard coordinates formula_61 on formula_5 (so that formula_63 is the formula_64-th component of formula_50). Then the differentials formula_66 at a point formula_10 form a basis for the vector space of linear maps from formula_5 to formula_4 and therefore, if formula_13 is differentiable at formula_10, we can write &quot;formula_72&quot; as a linear combination of these basis elements:
formula_73

The coefficients formula_74 are (by definition) the partial derivatives of formula_13 at formula_10 with respect to formula_61. Hence, if formula_13 is differentiable on all of formula_5, we can write, more concisely:
formula_80

In the one-dimensional case this becomes
formula_81
as before.

This idea generalizes straightforwardly to functions from formula_5 to formula_83. Furthermore, it has the decisive advantage over other definitions of the derivative that it is invariant under changes of coordinates. This means that the same idea can be used to define the differential of smooth maps between smooth manifolds.

Aside: Note that the existence of all the partial derivatives of formula_6 at formula_8 is a necessary condition for the existence of a differential at formula_8. However it is not a sufficient condition. For counterexamples, see Gateaux derivative.

==== Differentials as linear maps on a vector space ====

The same procedure works on a vector space with a enough additional structure to reasonably talk about continuity. The most concrete case is a Hilbert space, also known as a complete inner product space, where the inner product and its associated norm define a suitable concept of distance. The same procedure works for a Banach space, also known as a complete Normed vector space. However, for a more general topological vector space, some of the details are more abstract because there is no concept of distance.

For the important case of a finite dimension, any inner product space is a Hilbert space, any normed vector space is a Banach space and any topological vector space is complete. As a result, you can define a coordinate system from an arbitrary basis and use the same technique as for formula_5.

=== Differentials as germs of functions ===

This approach works on any differentiable manifold. If
# and are open sets containing 
# formula_88 is continuous
# formula_89 is continuous
then is equivalent to at , denoted formula_90, if and only if
there is an open formula_91 containing such that formula_92 for every in .
The germ of at , denoted formula_93, is the set of all real continuous functions equivalent to at ; if is smooth at then formula_93 is a smooth germ.
If
#formula_95, formula_96 formula_97 and formula_98 are open sets containing 
#formula_99, formula_100, formula_101 and formula_102 are smooth functions
#formula_103
#formula_104
# is a real number
then
#formula_105
#formula_106
#formula_107
This shows that the germs at p form an algebra.

Define formula_108 to be the set of all smooth germs vanishing at and
formula_109 to be the product of ideals formula_110. Then a differential at (cotangent vector at ) is an element of formula_111. The differential of a smooth function at , denoted formula_112, is formula_113.

A similar approach is to define differential equivalence of first order in terms of derivatives in an arbitrary coordinate patch.
Then the differential of at is the set of all functions differentially equivalent to formula_114 at .

=== Algebraic geometry ===

In algebraic geometry, differentials and other infinitesimal notions are handled in a very explicit way by accepting that the coordinate ring or structure sheaf of a space may contain nilpotent elements. The simplest example is the ring of dual numbers R[&quot;ε&quot;], where &quot;ε&quot;2 = 0.

This can be motivated by the algebro-geometric point of view on the derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; from R to R at a point &quot;p&quot;. For this, note first that &quot;f&quot; − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) belongs to the ideal &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot; of functions on R which vanish at &quot;p&quot;. If the derivative &quot;f&quot; vanishes at &quot;p&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) belongs to the square &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;2 of this ideal. Hence the derivative of &quot;f&quot; at &quot;p&quot; may be captured by the equivalence class [&quot;f&quot; − &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)] in the quotient space &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;/&quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;2, and the 1-jet of &quot;f&quot; (which encodes its value and its first derivative) is the equivalence class of &quot;f&quot; in the space of all functions modulo &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;2. Algebraic geometers regard this equivalence class as the &quot;restriction&quot; of &quot;f&quot; to a &quot;thickened&quot; version of the point &quot;p&quot; whose coordinate ring is not R (which is the quotient space of functions on R modulo &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;) but R[&quot;ε&quot;] which is the quotient space of functions on R modulo &quot;I&quot;&quot;p&quot;2. Such a thickened point is a simple example of a scheme.

==== Algebraic geometry notions ====

Differentials are also important in algebraic geometry, and there are several important notions.
* Abelian differentials usually mean differential one-forms on an algebraic curve or Riemann surface.
* Quadratic differentials (which behave like &quot;squares&quot; of abelian differentials) are also important in the theory of Riemann surfaces.
* Kähler differentials provide a general notion of differential in algebraic geometry.

=== Synthetic differential geometry ===

A fifth approach to infinitesimals is the method of synthetic differential geometry or smooth infinitesimal analysis. This is closely related to the algebraic-geometric approach, except that the infinitesimals are more implicit and intuitive. The main idea of this approach is to replace the category of sets with another category of &quot;smoothly varying sets&quot; which is a topos. In this category, one can define the real numbers, smooth functions, and so on, but the real numbers &quot;automatically&quot; contain nilpotent infinitesimals, so these do not need to be introduced by hand as in the algebraic geometric approach. However the logic in this new category is not identical to the familiar logic of the category of sets: in particular, the law of the excluded middle does not hold. This means that set-theoretic mathematical arguments only extend to smooth infinitesimal analysis if they are &quot;constructive&quot; (e.g., do not use proof by contradiction). Constructivists regard this disadvantage as a positive thing, since it forces one to find constructive arguments wherever they are available.

=== Nonstandard analysis ===

The final approach to infinitesimals again involves extending the real numbers, but in a less drastic way. In the nonstandard analysis approach there are no nilpotent infinitesimals, only invertible ones, which may be viewed as the reciprocals of infinitely large numbers. Such extensions of the real numbers may be constructed explicitly using equivalence classes of sequences of real numbers, so that, for example, the sequence (1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/&quot;n&quot;, ...) represents an infinitesimal. The first-order logic of this new set of hyperreal numbers is the same as the logic for the usual real numbers, but the completeness axiom (which involves second-order logic) does not hold. Nevertheless, this suffices to develop an elementary and quite intuitive approach to calculus using infinitesimals, see transfer principle.

==Differential geometry==
The notion of a differential motivates several concepts in differential geometry (and differential topology).
*The differential (Pushforward) of a map between manifolds.
*Differential forms provide a framework which accommodates multiplication and differentiation of differentials.
*The exterior derivative is a notion of differentiation of differential forms which generalizes the differential of a function (which is a differential 1-form).
*Pullback is, in particular, a geometric name for the chain rule for composing a map between manifolds with a differential form on the target manifold.
*Covariant derivatives or differentials provide a general notion for differentiating of vector fields and tensor fields on a manifold, or, more generally, sections of a vector bundle: see Connection (vector bundle). This ultimately leads to the general concept of a connection.

== Other meanings ==
The term &quot;differential&quot; has also been adopted in homological algebra and algebraic topology, because of the role the exterior derivative plays in de Rham cohomology: in a cochain complex formula_115 the maps (or &quot;coboundary operators&quot;) &quot;di&quot; are often called differentials. Dually, the boundary operators in a chain complex are sometimes called &quot;codifferentials&quot;.

The properties of the differential also motivate the algebraic notions of a &quot;derivation&quot; and a &quot;differential algebra&quot;.

<text>Foot roasting is a method of torture used since ancient times.

==Ancient Rome==
The Romans immobilized the prisoner and pressed red-hot iron plates to the soles of his feet. The Spanish Inquisition bound the prisoner face-upward to the rack with his bare feet secured in a stocks. The soles of the feet were basted with lard or oil and slowly barbecued over a brazier of burning coals. A screen could be interposed between the feet and the coals to modulate the exposure, while a bellows controlled the intensity of the flame. A version that consisted of a chair with an integrated foot stocks was referred to as the Spanish chair, but this is readily confused with the Iron chair. By way of contrast, in the Brittany chair, the coals were held in a movable iron tray which could be cranked upward until it actually made contact with the feet. Added diversions included placing slivers of hot coals between the toes, or suspending the prisoner head-downward and placing hot coals directly on the soles. The destruction of the Order of the Knights Templars is credited largely to foot roasting, which was committed with savagery sufficient to, literally, drive the sufferers to insanity; Knights also had their toes denailed.

== Brittany ==
In Brittany, a torture chair was used that immobilized the feet and provided a movable tray of coals that could be cranked up and down, eventually making physical contact with the soles of the feet.

== Star kicking ==
A form of torture called &quot;star kicking&quot; supposedly began with Countess Elizabeth Bathory, who derived sadistic pleasure from placing oiled bits of paper or string between her prisoners’ toes and lighting the material on fire, inflicting savage burns.

<doc id="677216" wikidata="Q1730130" url="?curid=677216" title="Later Qin">
<text>Qin, known in historiography as the Later Qin (; 384–417) or Yao Qin (), was a dynastic state of China ruled by the Yao clan of Qiang ethnicity during the Sixteen Kingdoms period in northern China. As the only Qiang-led state among the Sixteen Kingdoms, it was most known for its propagation of Buddhism under its second ruler, Yao Xing, who sponsored the Madhyamakin monk, Kumārajīva to translate Sanskrit Buddhist text into Chinese.

All rulers of the Later Qin declared themselves emperors, but for a substantial part of Yao Xing&#x27;s reign, he used the title Heavenly King. Historiographers gave the state the prefix of &quot;Later&quot; to distinguish it with the Former Qin and Western Qin as it was founded during the Former Qin&#x27;s collapse after the Battle of Fei River and went on to conquer the Former Qin&#x27;s power base in the Guanzhong. With Chang&#x27;an as its capital, the Later Qin also controlled Henan and vassalised the Western Qin, the four Liangs (Later, Southern, Northern and Western), Southern Yan, Qiao Shu, Chouchi and various tribes of the Ordos region.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The Yao clan was from Nan’an Commandery (南安郡; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and claimed descent from the Shaodang Qiang. Their chieftain, Yao Kehui (姚柯回), assisted Cao Wei during their conquest of Shu Han, and was later appointed Commander of the Western Qiang for his merits. His son, Yao Yizhong succeeded him, and during the Disaster of Yongjia that befell the Western Jin dynasty, he occupied Yumei (榆眉; east of present-day Qianyang County, Shaanxi) and welcomed refugees under his wing.

Yizhong later submitted to the Han-Zhao dynasty, and then the Later Zhao dynasty, where he associated himself with the commander, Shi Hu. After Shi Hu seized power in 333, he followed Yizhong&#x27;s advice of relocating the powerful Di and Qiang families in the Guanzhong to live around the capital, Xiangguo (襄國, in modern Xingtai, Hebei). Yizhong and his family were relocated to Shetou (灄頭; southeast of present-day Zaoqiang County, Hebei), where he supervised the Qiang tribes as the Grand Commander of the Western Qiang (西羌大都督).

Although Yizhong was one of Shi Hu&#x27;s most trusted officials, he and many other military generals colluded to overthrow his successor, Shi Shi by supporting Shi Zun after his death in 349. As Later Zhao descended into civil war, Yizhong tried to return west to the Guanzhong with his army, but was defeated by the Di general, Fu Hong, whose family founded the Former Qin dynasty in 351. Thus, Yizhong remained behind to aid the last emperor, Shi Zhi, in his war against Ran Min.

After Shi Zhi&#x27;s death in 351, Yizhong advised his sons to move south to join the Eastern Jin dynasty. His son, Yao Xiang succeeded him in 352 and fulfilled his promise. He partook in the early Jin northern expeditions as a general, but due to suspicion from his superior, Yin Hao, he later rebelled in 354. He led his army through northern China in hopes of returning to his ancestral home in Longxi, fighting against Former Qin and Jin forces along the way. However, in 357, he was killed in an ambush by Former Qin forces, prompting his brother, Yao Chang to surrender with their army.

Yao Chang became a general during the reign of Fu Jian and participated in various campaigns, but was not present at the disastrous Battle of Fei River in 383. After the battle, two branches of the Murong-Xianbei rebelled, forming the Later Yan in northeastern China and the Western Yan near Former Qin&#x27;s capital, Chang&#x27;an in 384. Yao Chang initially aided Fu Jian against the Western Yan, but during the course of the war, he feared punishment following a serious defeat and fled to the horse pastures north of the Wei River.

=== Reign of Yao Chang ===
At the same time, many of the local Han Chinese and tribal gentry clans had lost faith in the Former Qin and saw Yao Chang as a suitable successor. They gathered thousands of Qiang families and led them to join him. After some hesitation, he agreed to lead their coalition, taking the title of Everlasting King of Qin and proclaiming a new reign era in 384. To distinguish between the two states, historiographers refer to the Fu clan&#x27;s state as Former Qin and Yao Chang&#x27;s state as Later Qin.

Initially, Yao Chang avoided going straight for Chang’an, which was hotly contested between Fu Jian and Western Yan forces. He submitted to the stronger Western Yan, and after several battles with Former Qin forces, he ambushed and captured Fu Jian, who left Chang&#x27;an with his army in search of food. Yao Chang tried to force Fu Jian into formally abdicating the throne to him, but after he refused, had him killed instead. Chang’an eventually fell to Western Yan forces, who soon left to return to their homeland in the east. In 386, Yao Chang occupied the city, where he elevated himself to Emperor of (Later) Qin.

Despite Fu Jian&#x27;s death, there were still pockets of Former Qin and semi-independent forces in the Guanzhong region. A distant cousin of Fu Jian, Fu Deng, was acclaimed the new Emperor of (Former) Qin and waged war against Yao Chang. Yao Chang lost several battles to Fu Deng early on, but brought the conflict to a stalemate with a crucial victory at the Battle of Dajie in 389. From this point on, Fu Deng was unable to launch a major campaign, and Yao Chang soon gained the advantage by subjugating local warlords.

=== Early reign of Yao Xing and zenith of Later Qin ===

In 394, Yao Chang died and was succeeded by his son, Yao Xing. Hearing news of Yao Chang&#x27;s death, Fu Deng led his army to attack Later Qin. At the Battle of Feiqiao, Later Qin won a decisive victory by crushing the main Former Qin force. No longer posing a threat, Yao Xing soon captured and executed Fu Deng, while the last ruler of Former Qin was killed in battle by Western Qin forces in 394. Yao Xing thus unified the Guanzhong, establishing Later Qin as a regional power. While he initially inherited his father&#x27;s title of Emperor, he changed it to Heavenly King in 399.

Under Yao Xing, the Later Qin greatly expanded their borders, occupying areas in the Ordos, Longxi and Hedong regions. Most notably, in 399, they capitalized on Eastern Jin&#x27;s internal turmoil to capture Luoyang and several commanderies north of the Han and Huai rivers. In 400, they conquered Western Qin, and in 401, they forced the Later Liang into submission after besieging their capital. Fearing Later Qin&#x27;s presence, the other Hexi states, Southern Liang, Northern Liang and Western Liang, followed suit. Despite success in the west, Yao Xing was dissuaded from expanding east after a heavy defeat to the Northern Wei at the Battle of Chaibi in 402. The Later Liang surrendered their territory in 403, and in 405, Chouchi also submitted, bringing Later Qin to its peak.

Yao Xing upheld Confucianism by inviting famous Confucian scholars to teach in Chang&#x27;an and allowing easy access to the capital for aspiring students. At the same time, he was also an avid believer in Buddhism and heavily promoted the religion in his state. In 401, he welcomed the Kuchean monk, Kumarajiva to his court, where he was highly honoured and became one of the most important translators of Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Chinese. It was also under the Later Qin in 399 when the monk Faxian departed from Chang&#x27;an for India to acquire Buddhist texts. Yao Xing built various temples and pagodas, with construction of the Maijishan Grottoes beginning under his reign, and records claim that around nine-tenths of the population in Later Qin practiced Buddhism.

=== Decline and fall ===
Upon reaching its peak, the Later Qin quickly declined due to pressure from its own vassals and the Eastern Jin. Yao Xing ceded twelves commaderies around the Han river at the request of Jin&#x27;s paramount authority, Liu Yu, in exchange for peace, while giving up his holdings in the Hexi to the Southern Liang. In 407, he received Southern Yan and Western Shu&#x27;s submissions, but lost Chouchi&#x27;s allegicance to Jin. Worst of all, however, was the rebellion of the Xiongnu general, Helian Bobo, in the Ordos. Bobo established the Helian Xia, and for many years, led a war against Later Qin that drained their resources and killed many key generals. In 409, the Western Qin was revived in the Longxi, further reducing Later Qin&#x27;s territory.

When Liu Yu led an expedition to conquer Southern Yan in 409, Yao Xing was powerless to stop him, leading to Southern Yan&#x27;s demise in 410. He responded with an invasion of Jing province in conjunction with Western Shu and the Jin rebel, Lu Xun, but was defeated. Both Western Shu and Lu Xun were later vanquished by Jin, and Later Qin entered itself into a marriage alliance with the Northern Wei to protect itself.

Internally, Yao Xing also laid the seeds for a succession crisis. He appointed his eldest son, Yao Hong as Crown Prince, but only after much hesitation. He showed more favour to his other son, Yao Bi, who he gave military power and assigned to guard the borders while Yao Hong oversaw matters in Chang&#x27;an. Yao Bi attempted to take the throne on three occasions, all which ended in failure. He was forgiven after the first two attempts and was finally forced to commit suicide after the third in 416. However, Yao Hong still had other younger brothers and cousins who held military command and ambitions to seize power.

After Yao Xing died in 416, Yao Hong was immediately met with rebellions by his dukes. There were also revolts by the Xiongnu and Qiang tribes, and the Helian Xia, Chouchi and Western Qin all took the chance to attack Later Qin. To deal with the threats, Yao Hong entrusted military affairs to his great-uncle, Yao Shao who had much initial success, but the chaos soon caught the attention of Liu Yu. He began an expedition to conquer Later Qin, and by late 417, Yao Shao had died while Jin forces entered the Guanzhong and reached Chang&#x27;an. In the end, Yao Hong surrendered and was sent to the Jin capital, Jiankang, where he was executed. Members of the Yao clan who surrendered to Jin were exterminated, while the others who fled to Northern Wei survived.

<text>Peter Jeffrey Kelsay Wisoff (born August 16, 1958) is an American physicist and former NASA astronaut. Wisoff qualified as mission specialist and flew in four Space Shuttle missions, with his first launch in 1993 and his last in 2000.

==Career==
Wisoff graduated from Norfolk Academy, Norfolk, Virginia, in 1976, received a bachelor of science degree in physics (with Highest Distinction) from University of Virginia in 1980, a master of science degree and a doctorate in applied physics from Stanford University in 1982 and 1986 respectively.

Wisoff&#x27;s graduate work at Stanford University (as a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellow) focused on development of short wavelength lasers. Wisoff later joined the faculty of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rice University. His research focused on the development of new vacuum ultraviolet and high intensity laser sources. He also collaborated with researchers from regional Texas Medical Centers on the applications of lasers to the reconstruction of damaged nerves and has collaborated with researchers at Rice University on new techniques for growing and evaluating semiconductor materials using lasers. Wisoff has contributed numerous papers at technical conferences and in journals in the areas of lasers and laser applications. On October 1, 2013, Wisoff was named the interim principal associate director for the NIF and Photon Sciences directorate at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in place of the outgoing Ed Moses.

==NASA career==

Selected by NASA in January 1990, Wisoff became an astronaut in July 1991. He is qualified for flight assignment as a mission specialist. His technical assignments to date include: spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control; flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); coordinating flight crew equipment; evaluating extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment and techniques for the construction of Space Station; lead for the Payloads and Habitability Branch of the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, STS-57 in 1993, STS-68 in 1994, STS-81 in 1997 and STS-92 in 2000, Wisoff has logged a total of 42 days, 56 hours, 1 minute and 48 seconds in space, including 19 hours and 53 minutes of EVA time in three space walks.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-57 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (June 21 to July 1, 1993) launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The primary objective of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA) using the RMS. Additionally, this mission featured the first flight of Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials and life sciences research. During the mission Wisoff conducted a 5-hour, 50-minute spacewalk during which the EURECA communications antennas were manually positioned for latching, and various extravehicular activity tools and techniques were evaluated for use on future missions. STS-57 was accomplished in 155 orbits of the Earth in 239 hours and 45 minutes.

STS-68 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (September 30 to October 11, 1994) was the Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2) mission. As part of NASA&#x27;s Mission to Planet Earth, SRL-2 was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour&#x27;s cargo bay to study Earth&#x27;s surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth&#x27;s surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. Following 183 orbits of the Earth in 269 hours and 46 minutes, the eleven-day mission ended with Space Shuttle Endeavour landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

STS-81 &quot;Atlantis&quot; (January 12–22, 1997) was a ten-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia&#x27;s Space Station Mir, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Following 160 orbits of the Earth in 244 hours, 55 minutes, the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey.

STS-92 &quot;Discovery&quot; (October 11–24, 2000) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 13-day flight, the seven member crew attached the Z1 Truss and Pressurized Mating Adapter 3 to the International Space Station using Discovery&#x27;s robotic arm and performed four spacewalks to configure these elements. This expansion of the ISS opened the door for future assembly missions and prepared the station for its first resident crew. Wisoff also tested the SAFER jet backpack with fellow astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria, flying up to 50 feet from the spacecraft. He totaled 13 hours and 16 minutes of EVA time in two spacewalks. The STS-92 mission was accomplished in 202 orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles in 12 days, 21 hours, 40 minutes and 25 seconds.

He is related to Charles Wisoff.

<text>The tablillas are an alleged Medieval Spanish technique of torture for crushing the toes and fingers by means of pillories and wedges.

==Description and procedure==
The only writer to comment in detail on the torture of the tablillas may be paraphrased as follows: &quot;The torture of the tablillas is rarely given, the subject trussed up as for the torture of water and cords; having not obtained confession, four palm-sized tablillas are brought, each with five narrow finger-width or toe-width holes, and to give grave pain they hammer a wedge, bit by bit, between the hole and the trapped finger or toe, one after the other; and the fingers and toes are so crushed and beaten, and the torture quite remarkably savage that rarely do the judges exhaust the wedges, for some faint and others confess the crime.&quot; One presumes that rough wedges were used, additionally skinning and shredding flesh from the toes during the crushing process.

Since the French brodequin was open at the front, the same effect could be achieved by simply hammering wedges between the exposed toes. However, the tablillas gave the torturer finer control, specifically, the ability to crush one toe at a time before proceeding to the next.

<text>Philip Henderson Hoff (June 29, 1924 – April 26, 2018) was an American politician from the U.S. state of Vermont. He was most notable for his service as the 73rd governor of Vermont from 1963 to 1969, the state&#x27;s first Democratic governor since 1853.

==Life and career==
Hoff was born in Turners Falls, Massachusetts, the son of Agnes (Henderson) and Olaf Hoff, Jr. His father worked in the insurance industry and served two terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Hoff was a star high school football player, scoring the winning touchdown in Turners Falls High School&#x27;s 1942 annual game against rival Greenfield High School.

Hoff attended Williams College, where he studied English, but postponed graduation for two years in order to serve in World War II. He enisted in December 1942 and saw combat action during World War II aboard the submarine, USS &quot;Sea Dog&quot;, which took part in combat patrols throughout the Pacific Ocean theater. He attained the rank of Seaman First Class with the rating of quartermaster (the Navy&#x27;s term for a navigator), and was discharged in 1946. He met his wife, Joan Brower, during his naval service and they married in 1948. After graduating from Williams College in 1948, he attended Cornell Law School, where he joined the Phi Delta Phi fraternity and graduated in 1951. The Hoffs were the parents of four daughters―Susan, Dagny, Andrea, and Gretchen. 

The Hoffs moved to Burlington, Vermont, in 1951, where Hoff began a law practice. He also became involved in local politics as a Democrat, and was a founder of the activist group Vermont Democratic Volunteers. In addition to serving as a justice of the peace, he was also chairman of the city zoning board. Hoff was also an officer of the Chittenden County Bar Association and a member of the Burlington-Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce board of directors.

==Career==

Hoff was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives in 1960, and served one term, 1961 to 1963. As a legislator, Hoff was a member of the &quot;Young Turks,&quot; a bipartisan alliance of progressive and reform minded representatives and senators that included Republicans Franklin S. Billings Jr. and Ernest W. Gibson III.

In 1962, Hoff was elected Vermont&#x27;s first Democratic governor since the Vermont General Assembly selected John S. Robinson after no candidate obtained a popular vote majority in 1853. Hoff waged an energetic campaign against incumbent Republican F. Ray Keyser Jr., and capitalized on local factors including a split between Vermont&#x27;s conservative and progressive Republicans (the Proctor Wing and the Aiken-Gibson Wing). Rather than support the conservative Keyser, many of Vermont&#x27;s liberal Republicans opted to support Hoff on a third party line, which contributed to his narrow margin of victory. Hoff was also aided by national factors, including the popularity of incumbent Democratic President John F. Kennedy, to whom Hoff was often compared.

Hoff won reelection in 1964 and 1966. During his governorship, he pioneered unprecedented environmental, development, and social welfare programs, including the creation of the Governor&#x27;s Commission on the Status of Women. Concerned about racial justice, he joined with New York Mayor John Lindsay to co-found the Vermont-New York Youth Project, which brought minority students from the city together with Vermont students to work on joint summer projects at several Vermont colleges. According to the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the program, which temporarily doubled Vermont&#x27;s black population, &quot;uncovered some latent bigotry that had not been visible before.&quot; The poll tax was eliminated during his tenure as governor, and the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation, Legal Aid and Vermont Public Television were established.

Hoff was the first Democratic Governor in the nation to split with President Lyndon Johnson over the Vietnam War and later campaigned across the country to promote Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s effort to obtain the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Hoff endorsed Eugene McCarthy. Democrats who opposed Johnson came close to nominating Hoff as a candidate for Vice President at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, but after some initial enthusiasm, Hoff declined to put his name forward.

Hoff&#x27;s endorsement of Kennedy and later McCarthy upset conservative Democrats and Hoff was also criticized for increases in state spending which some claimed led to hefty deficits. In 1970, Hoff challenged incumbent U.S. Senator Winston L. Prouty, but Prouty easily won reelection. During the campaign, Hoff announced that he had battled alcoholism in the past. Had he won, Hoff would have been the first Democratic senator in Vermont history.

In the 1980s he returned to elective politics, serving three terms in the Vermont State Senate (1983-1989). He also served in various advisory and honorary positions and as President of the Board of Trustees at Vermont Law School as well as continuing his work as a lawyer in private practice. In 1989, he co-founded the law firm of Hoff, Curtis.

==Death==
Hoff died at an assisted living facility in Shelburne, Vermont, on April 26, 2018, at age 93.

==Legacy==
Hoff was the subject of a biography, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Philip Hoff: How Red Turned Blue in the Green Mountain State&quot; by Samuel B. Hand, Anthony Marro, and Stephen C. Terry.

In 2012, Castleton State College named its newest residence hall after Hoff, the first building to be named in his honor.

<text>Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler (1892 – 31 December 1953) was an Orthodox rabbi, Talmudic scholar, and Jewish philosopher of the 20th century. He is best known for being the &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (&quot;spiritual counselor&quot;) of the Ponevezh yeshiva in Israel and through collections of his writings published posthumously by his pupils.

==Biography==
===Lithuania===
Eliyahu Dessler, who was known throughout his life as &quot;Eliyahu Leizer&quot; or &quot;Elya Lazer&quot;, was born in 1892 (5652) in Gomel. His father, Reuven Dov Dessler, was a disciple of one of the main leaders of the Musar movement, Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv, best known as the &quot;Alter (Elder) of Kelm&quot;. Eliyahu was orphaned of his mother at a young age. His father remarried, and would become a successful timber merchant in the city of Homel over the ensuing years, although he would lose virtually his whole fortune after the Russian Revolution, which would prompt his son to relocate to England (1929).

The young Elya was taught by private tutors. At the age of 13 (in 1906), he was to be one of the youngest students at the yeshiva of Kelm, which was then being led by Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Braude, the son-in-law of the founder. Rabbi Dessler would later speak in fond terms on the study and self-perfection in the Kelm yeshiva. It was unusual in the sense that it provided its pupils with a secular education parallel to their religious studies, enabling them to earn a livelihood rather than having to take up rabbinic positions.

In Kelm, Eliyahu was a diligent student, and received semicha (Rabbinic ordination) from his uncle, Rabbi Chaim Ozer Grodzinski, who became the spiritual leader of Orthodox Lithuanian Jewry until his death in 1939 and rarely granted ordinations.

In 1920 Rabbi Dessler married Bluma, a granddaughter of the &quot;Alter&quot; of Kelm. He entered business with his father, and declined a position as a rabbinical judge in Vilna.

After the death of his stepmother in 1928, Dessler was obliged to accompany his father to London for medical treatment, and decided to remain in the United Kingdom. His wife and children stayed behind for the time being.

===London===
In London Dessler served in the rabbinate, initially in the East End and later in Dalston, Northeast London. His family joined him in 1931.

In Dalston he started tutoring a number of young people, and for a while he was the private tutor of the children of the wealthy Sassoon family. A pupil from this time, Aryeh Carmell, became one of the main disseminators of Dessler&#x27;s ideas after his death.

His son left London in the early 1930s to study in the yeshiva of Kelm. During the war they escaped to the Far East, and eventually settled in the United States. Several months before the outbreak of World War II, his wife left for Lithuania with her daughter to visit relatives. The war separated them, and the women spent the war mainly in Australia.

===Gateshead===
In the early 1940s, Dessler assumed leadership of the newly formed Gateshead kollel, an institute of religious study for married men, then a novelty in Western Europe. During the ensuing years he led the &quot;kollel&quot;, raised its funds, and also tutored small groups of young people.

===Ponevezh===
In the late 1940s, the leadership of the Ponevezh yeshiva in the Israeli town of Bnei Berak convinced Dessler to become &quot;mashgiach ruchani&quot; (spiritual counsellor and lecturer on ethical issues). He relocated to Israel, again gathering a small circle of students. One of his pupils, Chaim Friedländer, would later fill his position as Ponevezh &quot;mashgiach&quot;.

===Death===
Rabbi Dessler died quite suddenly on December 31, 1953 (Hebrew date 25 Tevet 5714), presumably of ischemic heart disease. He had suffered from peripheral vascular disease in the months prior to his death.

==Philosophy==
===Michtav me-Eliyahu===
Most of Rabbi Dessler&#x27;s work has reached the public through the pupils he reared in England and Israel, 
chiefly Aryeh Carmell and Chaim Friedlander.
Together, they edited his collected correspondence and ethical writings posthumously in the six-volume &quot;Michtav me-Eliyahu&quot; (&quot;Letter from Elijah&quot; which alludes to the letter that the prophet Elijah sent to the King of Judah that arrived after Elijah ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire), later translated into English and published as &quot;Strive for Truth&quot;.

Perhaps one of his most influential ideas, discussed throughout his works but especially in an essay in the first volume of &quot;Michtav me-Eliyahu&quot; entitled &quot;Kuntres ha-Chesed&quot; (Heb. קונטרס החסד &quot;Pamphlet [on the topic] of Lovingkindness), is the &quot;Jewish philosophy of love.&quot; He observes that the perfect love from the point of view of Jewish philosophy is not &quot;give and take&quot; but focuses exclusively on &quot;giving&quot;.

Dessler also believed that the acquisition of secular knowledge came at the expense of Torah knowledge. He warned against studying foreign or secular ideas.

He also warned against preoccupation with materialism and technology, which, in his view, distance mankind from spirituality and detracted from believing in . He writes that a civilization which is preoccupied with developing the external and the material, and neglects the inner moral content will eventually degenerate to its lowest possible depths.

One idea of his, expounded on in Michtav me-Eliyahu, is the &quot;Nekudas Habechira&quot; (point of free will). 
He states that a man has one point in his service to God where he has to fight his evil inclination, while at other points there will be no struggle, for the levels below this have already been conquered, and he will easily win those battles of will; whereas levels higher are not yet within his grasp. 
(For example, someone who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem keeping kosher, but may sometimes be tempted to rely on unreliable kosher supervision, while somebody farther away from religious practice will have to struggle with whether to eat a ham sandwich (which is non-kosher regardless of supervision).) 
Each time one defeats the evil inclination by choosing to do good over evil, his Nekudas Habechira is raised a bit higher, and that choice will be easier for him to make in the future. Consequently, Man&#x27;s task in life is to consistently raise his Nekudas Habechira, thus growing ever greater in his service of God.
See generally.

===Influences===
While it is difficult to determine which teachers had most influence on Rabbi Dessler, it is apparent that he is a child of the yeshiva world of the early 20th century, which was then influenced heavily by the ethical Musar movement, but has similarly gained proficiency in Kabbalah and works of Hasidic Judaism and Jewish philosophy. His method in interpreting tenets of Jewish philosophy reveals an adherence to the principles of the Maharal (Rabbi Loeb of Prague, 16th century). He drew inspiration from the teachings of Rabbi Nahman of Bratslav. A minor influence appears to have been the 19th century Hasidic work, Tanya. Rabbi Dessler did, however, maintain that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.

<doc id="677271" wikidata="Q941699" url="?curid=677271" title="Kagerō-class destroyer">
<text>The were a class of nineteen 1st Class destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during the 1930s, and operated by them during the Pacific War, where all but one were lost.
They were also called the , because the second ship, , was launched before the first ship, .

The class was also one of a series called within the Imperial Japanese Navy from their plan name. At the time of introduction, these destroyers were among the deadliest destroyers afloat, primarily due to the excellent range and lethality of their &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedoes.

==Background==
Following on the success of the , the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class was very similar in design, but was slightly larger and incorporated a number of improvements which had been gained through operational experience. It had a heavier main battery and much heavier torpedo armament than other contemporary foreign destroyer designs. The first 15 ships of this class were ordered in 1937 under the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and the final four vessels were ordered in 1939 under the 4th Naval Armaments Supplement Programme. The final vessel in the class, , was sometimes mistaken for part of the succeeding by immediate postwar historians due to confusion over the number of fictitious destroyers listed in the Japanese budgetary records in an effort to conceal the budget devoted to the secret battleships.

==Design and description==
The &quot;Kagerō&quot; class used a similar but slightly enlarged hull and bridge as the preceding &quot;Asashio&quot; class and had an almost identical silhouette. The main visual difference was that the reloads for the forward torpedo launcher were located in front of the launcher instead of to the rear. The ships measured overall, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The displacement and beam were thus slightly larger than for the &quot;Asashio&quot; class, giving greater stability.

Their crew numbered 240 officers and enlisted men. The ships had two Kampon geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Kampon water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a designed speed of . However, the class proved capable of exceeding 35.5 knots on sea trials. The ships were designed with a range of at a speed of . However, the class more accurately proved to have a range of on trials. The &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; differed from her sisterships in having an experimental boiler system that built up a higher steam pressure. While the ship&#x27;s top speed of 35.5 knots remained unaffected, she possessed a remarkably superior fuel economy to her sister ships, and thus scored a longer range. This engine design was used as a basis for the Japanese &quot;super destroyer&quot; &quot;Shimakaze&quot;.

===Armament===
As built, the weapons suite of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class was identical to that of the preceding &quot;Asashio&quot; class. The main battery consisted of six 5-inch 12.7 cm/50 Type 3 naval guns in three twin-gun turrets, one superfiring pair aft and one turret forward of the superstructure. The guns were capable of 55-degree elevation. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons initially comprised 16 depth charges, which was increased to 36 during the course of the Pacific War.

In terms of anti-aircraft capability, initially two twin-mount Type 96 AA guns were placed forward of the second smokestack. As the war progressed, the number of Type 96 guns was gradually increased. In 1942–1943, the twin mounts were replaced by triple mounts, and another twin mount was added forward of the bridge. From 1943 to 1944, on surviving vessels the superfiring &quot;X&quot; turret was removed and replaced by two more triple mounts. In late 1944, the seven surviving vessels were fitted with a varying number of additional guns. and received seven single mounts, whereas received 14 single mounts and four Type 93 13 mm machine guns.

 became the first Japanese destroyer to be equipped with radar when a Type 22 set was installed in late 1942. The other vessels were equipped with radar as they rotated back to Japan for repair or refit. All seven vessels surviving in mid-1944 also received a Type 13 radar.

==Ships in class==
== Operational history==

Seven out of the eleven destroyers of the Pearl Harbor strike force were of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class. During the start of World War II for Japan, the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class took part in a large variety of convoy and carrier escorting duties, and the occasional shore bombardment, to support the invasion of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies. Notably, the &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; captured the port of Davao, bombarding the naval facilities to send back British machine gunners and destroying a British oil tanker in the process. In the latter campaign, &quot;Natsushio&quot; became the first loss of the class when she was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine , while the entirety of destroyer division 16 took part in the Battle of the Java Sea, where &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; was damaged by a shell hit from the destroyer , but otherwise did not do anything of note, but in the battle&#x27;s aftermath, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; assisted in capturing the hospital ship .

The careers of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class began to pick up in March 1942 with the fall of the Dutch East Indies, with &quot;Nowaki&quot; and &quot;Arashi&quot; picking up an active role hunting down Allied warships attempting to escape to Australia, during which they together either sank or helped to sink the destroyer-minelayer hybrid , the gunboat , the sloop , three minesweepers, an oil tanker, four cargo ships, and a depot ship, alongside helping to capture three cargo ships. &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; destroyed the Dutch submarine before &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Yukikaze&quot; helped to sink the submarine , &quot;Shiranui&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot; helped to sink the cargo ship &quot;Modjokerto&quot;, while &quot;Urakaze&quot; helped to sink the cargo ship &quot;Enggano&quot;. From then on, a series of escorting duties ensued until the Battle of Midway, during which &quot;Kagerō&quot;-class destroyers escorted the aircraft carriers, invasion convoy, and battleship force. Particularly, &quot;Arashi&quot; attacked the submarine , enabling &quot;Arashi&quot; to be spotted by an American aircraft and trailed to the location of the Japanese aircraft carriers, leading to a devastating victory in which all four Japanese carriers and the heavy cruiser were sunk by American carrier-based aircraft. After the battle, &quot;Arashi&quot;″s crew committed a war crime when they murdered the downed pilot Ensign Wesley Osmus.

After that blunder, it was off to the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal campaigns, which saw much of the same service, but mixed with troop and supply transport missions, during which &quot;Arashi&quot; helped to sink the freighter &quot;Anshun,&quot; plus escorting carriers at the battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz. In the latter battle, &quot;Akigumo&quot; assisted in finishing off the crippled and abandoned aircraft carrier . On November 13, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Yukikaze&quot; fought in the first naval battle of Guadalcanal, and both became key players of the battle. With torpedo hits, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; sank the destroyer and helped to sink the light cruiser , before shelling the crippled heavy cruiser , but in turn was blasted by the light cruiser . She survived and withdrew to Truk. In stark contrast, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; survived the battle completely undamaged, and for her part helped to sink the destroyer with gunfire, then sank the destroyer with a torpedo hit to her stern, before transporting survivors from the sunken battleship to Truk. Two days later, &quot;Kagerō&quot; and &quot;Oyashio&quot; took part in a torpedo attack against the battleship during the second naval battle of Guadalcanal, but inflicted no damage. On November 25, &quot;Hayashio&quot; was sunk by land-based aircraft, while on November 30, several ships of the class took part in the Battle of Tassafaronga, where &quot;Oyashio&quot; crippled the heavy cruiser with a torpedo hit that flooded her engine room and disabled three of her four 8-inch (203 mm) gun turrets.

With the start of 1943, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; and &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; sank the American torpedo boats &quot;PT-43&quot; and &quot;PT-112&quot;, while &quot;Isokaze&quot; and &quot;Maikaze&quot; sank the submarine , before both being damaged by American aircraft during Operation Ke. In March, &quot;Tokitsukaze&quot; was sunk by land-based aircraft during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea. On May 8, &quot;Kagerō&quot;, &quot;Kuroshio&quot;, and &quot;Oyashio&quot; all ran into a minefield, &quot;Kuroshio&quot; blew up and sank instantly, while &quot;Kagerō&quot; and &quot;Oyashio&quot; were crippled and finished off by land-based aircraft. In July, &quot;Tanikaze&quot; helped to sink the light cruiser USS &quot;Helena&quot; at the Battle of Kula Gulf, while &quot;Yukikaze&quot; and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; both served in the Battle of Kolombangara, where they combined torpedoes with two other destroyer to sink the destroyer and cripple the light cruisers and , while &quot;Yukikaze&quot; directly torpedoed the light cruiser , damaging her so badly she could not be repaired before the end of the war. On August 7, &quot;Arashi&quot; and &quot;Hagikaze&quot; were sunk by gunfire and torpedoes from the destroyers , , and at the Battle of Vella Gulf, then a week later &quot;Hamakaze&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot; both helped to defend a troop convoy against US destroyers at the Battle off Horaniu, both being damaged by one 5-inch (127 mm) shell hit, before &quot;Isokaze&quot; and &quot;Akigumo&quot; did the same at the battle of Vella Lavella on October 7. At the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, after being damaged in a collision, &quot;Hatsukaze&quot; was sunk by the destroyers , , , , and . A small piece of &quot;Hatsukaze&#x27;s&quot; bow returned to Rabaul lodged into the heavy cruiser &quot;Myōkō,&quot; later to be removed and scraped.

In 1944, the height of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class was over. They only scored one victory at the Battle off Samar, October 25, 1944, when &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;, &quot;Urakaze&quot;, and &quot;Nowaki&quot; helped to finish off the already crippled destroyer . In exchange, loss after loss piled up. On 10 January, &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; was damaged beyond repair, blown in half to a torpedo fired from the submarine . The forward half rapidly sank, while the rear half 
stayed afloat and was towed to Singapore. In February, &quot;Maikaze&quot; was sunk off Truk by the heavy cruisers and and the battleship . In April, &quot;Redfin&quot; also torpedoed and sank &quot;Akigumo&quot;, while later that June, &quot;Tanikaze&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine , before the rest of the class saw escorting duties during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In October, the remaining six functional ships of the class took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Hamakaze&quot; was damaged by air attacks on the 24th and forced to withdraw from the battle, while &quot;Shrianui&quot; escaped the Battle of the Surigao Strait without damage. &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;, &quot;Urakaze&quot;, and &quot;Nowaki&quot; fought Taffy 3 at the Battle off Samar, firing torpedoes at the US escort carriers without obtaining a hit before as stated helping to sink &quot;Johnston&quot;. However, as the Japanese ships attempted to escape, &quot;Nowaki&quot; was sunk with all hands, crippled by gunfire from US cruisers and finished off by the destroyer , while &quot;Shiranui&quot; was sunk with all hands by aircraft from the carrier . With the American invasion of the Philippines becoming increasingly successful, the remaining ships retreated to mainland Japan, during which &quot;Urakaze&quot; was sunk with all hands by the submarine in the same attack that sank the battleship . Upon returning to Japan, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;, and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; escorted the newly completed aircraft carrier , during which she was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine .

Only four ships of the class were still around by 1945, only three of which were functional. Throughout March and April, the Japanese command repeatedly hatched plans to deliver the still un-repaired &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; to mainland Japan, but each plan failed, culminating on April 6 when &quot;Amatsukaze&quot; was finally destroyed by land-based aircraft. The same day of &quot;Amatsukaze&quot;″s destruction, &quot;Yukikaze&quot;, &quot;Isokaze&quot;, and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; departed Japan as escorts for the battleship during Operation Ten-Go. En route the next day, the force was attack by nearly 400 carrier aircraft. Alongside the sinking of &quot;Yamato&quot;, &quot;Hamakaze&quot; was sunk by torpedo bombers from the light carrier , while &quot;Isokaze&quot; was fatally damaged by bomb hits from the light carriers and , resulting in &quot;Yukikaze&quot; scuttling the last of her sister ships, leaving her as the last &quot;Kagerō&quot;-class destroyer still afloat. For the rest of the war, &quot;Yukikaze&quot; saw a series of costal patrol duties, and by the end of the war, due to fuel shortages, was demoted to an anti-aircraft platform, surviving several air attacks by US carriers and survived for Emperor Hirohito to announce plans for an unconditional surrender on 15 August 1945, becoming one of only a handful of Japanese destroyers to survive the war.

&quot;Yukikaze&quot; was the only ship of the &quot;Kagerō&quot; class to survive the war, and was used to transport Japanese prisoners of war back to their homeland, and was heavily inspected post war by US Navy officials for documentation, before being transferred to the Taiwanese Navy in 1947. During her service as ROCS &quot;Dan Yang&quot;, the former &quot;Yukikaze&quot; took part in two shore bombardment missions, and captured two oil tankers and a cargo ship, alongside having over 50,000 overseas Chinese civilians tour the destroyer during a visit to Manila. The former &quot;Yukikaze&quot; was eventually decommissioned in 1966 after being damaged in a storm, and finally sold for scrapping material in 1970. &quot;Yukikaze&quot;″s rudder and one of her propellers are preserved in museums.

<text>BBC Birmingham is one of the oldest regional arms of the BBC, located in Birmingham. It was the first region outside London to start broadcasting both the corporation&#x27;s radio (in 1922) and television (in 1949) transmissions, the latter from the Sutton Coldfield television transmitter.

From 1971 BBC Birmingham was based at the Pebble Mill Studios, replacing studios on Broad Street, but in 2004 moved to the Mailbox facility in the city centre. Pebble Mill has been demolished to make way for a dental hospital and school of dentistry, which opened in 2016.

BBC Birmingham is not to be confused with BBC Midlands, which is also based at the Mailbox. While BBC Birmingham is the name of the Network Productions Centre in Birmingham making network programmes for television and radio, BBC Midlands is the regional operation providing news, current affairs and other regional programmes.

Some departments within BBC Birmingham, such as factual programming, have been subject to review as part of a wider restructuring process. Much of the factual department, making programmes such as &quot;Countryfile&quot;, has been moved to either Bristol, Salford or other BBC offices.

== Buildings ==

Before 1971, several converted buildings across the city were used for the BBC&#x27;s operations in Birmingham. At some point after the Second World War the BBC took over the headquarters of the Birmingham Royal Institution for the Blind, a very large collection of buildings in Carpenter Road, Edgbaston. Here in the 1950s were several radio studios, the largest of which was used by the Midlands Light Orchestra for rehearsals and live broadcasts. In 1957 BBC TV was established in Birmingham for the first time taking over the MLO&#x27;s studio and installing the necessary lighting on builders&#x27; scaffolding. By gutting an ex-London redundant BBC TV outside broadcast unit (&quot;Scanner&quot;) the necessary three cameras (RCA 3 inch image orthicons) were salvaged. The associated camera control units, sound and vision production/mixer desk and seating were all very precariously held together with Dexion angle and old packing cases. A smaller room alongside was used for early evening local news broadcasts by dragging a camera in from the main studio. Acoustic treatment was achieved using old egg trays glued to the walls. It was all &quot;make do and mend&quot; and breakdowns were frequent. In 1959 a new purpose built news studio equipped with latest &quot;miniature&quot; Vidicon cameras was established in Broad Street in an old building backing on to Gas Street Basin. This building was already the main &quot;switching centre&quot; for the national network for radio and TV. Carpenter Road was also the base for BBC Midlands TV outside broadcasts with MCR10 – a articulated mobile control unit – equipped with Marconi Mk1 3 inch image orthicon cameras. It was also the base for the necessary VHF/UHF &quot;Links Unit&quot; to get the outside broadcast pictures and sound back into the national network – in the Midlands area usually via the main TV transmitter mast at Sutton Coldfield. In 1959 the BBC acquired the Victorian-era ex-boxing booth/cinema/theatre at Gosta Green and this was completely internally altered to become a fully equipped TV studio and TV film unit with canteens, offices, green room and editing suite. 

Network television was based at Gosta Green just north of the city centre. Regional television and some radio production were in Broad Street. Other radio studios were located at Broadcasting House in Carpenter Road, Edgbaston, and at the Walker Hall in Ampton Road, Edgbaston. The Carpenter Road site also housed the administrative offices.

All these departments, together with a new local radio station, were unified on the Pebble Mill site in a phased move during 1970/71. The new complex, known as the Broadcasting Centre, was the BBC&#x27;s first building designed for both television and radio studios, and housed the corporation&#x27;s largest TV studio outside London at the time.
When Pebble Mill closed in 2004, BBC Birmingham moved to the Mailbox building in the city centre, and to the BBC Drama Village in the Selly Oak district.

It was announced in August 2022, that BBC Birmingham will leave The Mailbox for the new creative quarter in Digbeth, Birmingham from 2026. The new broadcast centre will occupy the former Tyhpoo Tea factory. By then in adjacent studios the BBC’s flagship show Masterchef would have already taken up residence. The move coincides with BBC’s lease at The Mailbox coming to an end having been located there since the move from Pebble Mill in 2004.

==Notable historical BBC Birmingham productions==

=== Drama ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, BBC Birmingham was home to the English Regions Drama Department, established in 1971, and headed by the senior BBC producer David Rose. Its remit was to produce programmes set in various regions of England in order to provide balance to the output from London.

Among the Department&#x27;s best known productions are perhaps &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot; (1982); &quot;Play for Today&quot; - The Fishing Party, contributions to &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot;; and a series of plays by new writers, called &quot;Second City Firsts&quot;, produced by Peter Ansorge and Tara Prem which aired on BBC2. The unit also produced the first BBC Television drama with a predominantly black and Asian cast, &quot;Empire Road&quot; (1978–79) also on BBC2. The long-running Sunday evening series &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1972–79), which starred Jean Anderson, was also a fixture at the studios.

=== &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot; ===
BBC Birmingham used the main foyer of its Pebble Mill building for the early afternoon television magazine programme &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;, which ran from 1972 until 1986 and raised the profile of the studios to something of a national institution. The idea to use the foyer came about because of a lack of other studio space. It was one of the few daytime magazine programmes at the time, and quickly became popular. The Pebble Mill format returned in 1988 as &quot;Daytime Live&quot;, renamed &quot;Scene Today&quot; and finally &quot;Pebble Mill&quot;.

There was a Pebble Mill spin-off during the 1970s, when BBC 1 rested its main Saturday chat show, &quot;Parkinson&quot;. BBC Birmingham was commissioned to produce a late night replacement. The result was &quot;Saturday Night at the Mill&quot; with Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen as the regular house band, who also performed the show&#x27;s signature tune. The programme was directed and produced by Roy Norton and Roy Ronnie.

In 1981, an early evening version of a 1960s hit show on BBC1 called &quot;Six Five Special&quot; re-surfaced during the Mill&#x27;s summer break, presented by Donny MacLeod and Marian Foster, and occupying the slot vacated by &quot;Nationwide&quot;.

=== Programmes for Asian Viewers ===
During the early &#x27;60s, BBC Birmingham pioneered television programmes, for the Asian community. These were presented and produced by Mahendra Kaul and directed by Ashok Rampal, and broadcast on Sunday mornings on the sole BBC Television channel at the time. The programme, &quot;Apna Hi Ghar Samajhiye&quot; (&quot;Make Yourself At Home&quot;) aired on Sundays at 9.00am for half an hour.

=== Hosted programmes ===
The Birmingham studios also occasionally accommodated productions usually based in London when regular studio space was unavailable, for example the children&#x27;s programmes, &quot;Play School&quot; and &quot;Jackanory&quot;, and the current affairs programme &quot;Nationwide&quot; during the power cuts of 1972 when the Lime Grove studios in London were in darkness.

Some nationally popular programmes were hosted by BBC Birmingham and recorded at the Pebble Mill Studios which included the children&#x27;s programme The &quot;Basil Brush&quot; show.

=== Other Programmes ===
A popular BBC2 programme from Birmingham for much of the 1970s-1990s was snooker programme &quot;Pot Black&quot;, generally shown most Fridays throughout the year at 9.00pm.

Well-known BBC programmes based in Birmingham included the drama series &quot;Dalziel and Pascoe&quot;, &quot;Dangerfield&quot;, &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;, &quot;This Life&quot;, daytime soap opera &quot;Doctors&quot;, anthology series &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot; and daytime property show &quot;To Buy or Not to Buy&quot;. Quiz shows including &quot;Telly Addicts&quot; were recorded at Pebble Mill. Gardening programme &quot;Gardener&#x27;s World&quot;, cooking show &quot;Hairy Bikers&quot;, factual series &quot;Coast&quot; the countryside and environmental series &quot;Countryfile&quot; and viewer feedback show &quot;Points of View&quot; were also all based here, until moving to BBC Bristol and BBC Northern Ireland respectively. The original series of &quot;Top Gear&quot; was also produced by BBC Birmingham as was some content of the astronomy-based programme &quot;The Sky at Night&quot;, while the rest is produced in Selsey.

==Current BBC Birmingham productions==

BBC Birmingham output has steadily diminished over time as production has moved elsewhere with the closure of Pebble Mill and the development of other BBC sites. &quot;Doctors&quot; is currently produced at the BBC Drama Village in Selly Oak, and &quot;The Archers&quot; is produced for BBC Radio 4. For afternoon broadcast after &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Father Brown&quot; and &quot;Shakespeare &amp; Hathaway: Private Investigators&quot; are current BBC Birmingham productions whereas &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot;, &quot;Land Girls&quot;, &quot;WPC 56&quot;, and &quot;The Coroner&quot; are former productions. The closure of the Factual Unit in 2012 meant no factual programmes outside of regional output are produced in Birmingham.

The Midlands contributes the highest portion of the BBC&#x27;s revenue through licence fees (£942 million) yet has the second lowest amount of BBC spending in the region, after Northern Ireland. This equates to &quot;91% of Midland BBC licence fees spent elsewhere&quot; 

==Regional output==

As with all other BBC regions, BBC Birmingham is responsible for providing local radio services and the regional television news broadcasts on BBC One during the times when all regions opt out of the network feed to provide their own local news programming, which in the BBC Birmingham area is called &quot;Midlands Today&quot;

BBC Midlands Today is broadcast from in the Mailbox in Birmingham, and is the regional news for;

* Herefordshire
* Worcestershire
* Warwickshire
* West Midlands
* Shropshire
* Staffordshire

<doc id="677277" wikidata="Q3045036" url="?curid=677277" title="Blade (archaeology)">
<text>In archaeology, a blade is a type of stone tool created by striking a long narrow flake from a stone core. This process of reducing the stone and producing the blades is called lithic reduction. Archaeologists use this process of flintknapping to analyze blades and observe their technological uses for historical purposes.

Blades are defined as being flakes that are at least twice as long as they are wide and that have parallel or subparallel sides and at least two ridges on the dorsal (outer) side. Blade cores appear and are different from regular flaking cores, as each core&#x27;s conchoidal nature is suited for different types of flaking. Blades are created using stones that have a cryptocrystalline structure and easily be fractured into a smooth piece without fracturing. Blades became the favored technology of the Upper Palaeolithic era, although they are occasionally found in earlier periods. Different techniques are also required for blade creation; a soft punch or hammerstone is necessary for creating a blade.

The long sharp edges of blades made them useful for a variety of purposes. After blades are flaked, they are often incorporated as parts of larger tools, such as spears. Other times, the simple shape and sharpness serves the designed role. Blades were often employed in the impression process of material culture, assisting ancient humans in imprinting ornate designs into other parts of their material culture. Scrapers, used for hide working or woodworking, or burins, used for engraving, are two common such examples.

Cores from which blades have been struck are called blade cores and the tools created from single blades are called blade tools. Small examples (under 12 mm) are called microblades and were used in the Mesolithic as elements of composite tools. Blades with one edge blunted by removal of tiny flakes are called backed blade. A blade core becomes an exhausted core when there are no more useful angles to knock off blades.

Blades can be classified into many different types depending on their shape and size. Archaeologists have also been known to use the microscopic striations created from the lithic reduction process to classify the blades into specific types. Once classified archaeologists can use this information to see how the blade was produced, who produced it, and how it was used.

== Archaeological Analysis ==
Archaeologists employ numerous methods to study both lithic and obsidian blades. Each method contributes to the overall understanding of blades and their roles in past societies.

* Trace Element Analysis (Obsidian) - This method of analysis involves measurements of the elemental composition of obsidian blades using the most common method of X-ray fluorescence (XRF). This allows researchers to select chemical compounds and compare them to known geological sources and identify patterns of procurement, trade, and distribution.
* Use-Wear Analysis - This method examines the microscopic traces left on blades or tools from use. Based on the examination of wear patterns, archaeologists are able to infer activities such as cutting, scraping, sawing, or hammering.
* Microscopic Analysis - This method of analysis utilizes microscopy techniques to examine both the external structure of lithic blades and the internal structure of obsidian blades. This allows researchers to identify manufacturing techniques such as heat treatment or pressure flaking for lithics blades and identify volcanic glass textures, such as microlite and flow banding in obsidian blades.
* Experimental Archaeology - This method involves replicating techniques and processes believed to be the same used to produce ancient tools and blades. Archaeologists use this method to gain first-hand experience on how these tools may have been used for and why they may have been produced.
* Residue Analysis - This method involves extracting and examining organic and inorganic residues left on well-preserved vessel walls or tool surfaces. This method provides insight into potential foodways, ritual activities, subsistence, economy, and tool function. Some methods that are used include Liquid chromatography, Gas chromatography, and Stable Isotope analysis.
* Obsidian Hydration Dating -  Is a geochemical method of determining age in either absolute or relative terms of an artifact made of obsidian.

== Function and Use ==
Like the many methods of studyng blades, there is a significant amount of uses these blades could have served.

* Butchering and Cutting -  Blades were primarily used for cutting and carving tasks. They were essential for activities such as butchering animals, preparing food, crafting tools and utensils, and shaping wood, bone, or other materials.
* Hunting -  Blades played a crucial role in hunting and fishing. Groups used blades as components of projectile points and spearheads, which they attached to arrows, spears, or harpoons. These sharp blades increased the efficiency of hunting and fishing activities.
* Processing foods and materials - Blades were employed in processing plant materials. Groups used blades to harvest plants, cut fibers for weaving baskets or mats, prepare materials for cordage, and process seeds or grains for food preparation.
* Blades held ceremonial and symbolic significance for many indigenous groups in California. They were incorporated into rituals, dances, and sacred ceremonies, often representing strength, power, or ancestral connections.

The role of functions and use vary between tribes and regions. Lithic and Obsidian blades played a major role in many of their daily aspect of life.

== Cultural implications ==

Blade technology, too, is able to provide researchers with understanding of the social realms of the culture in question. For example, in 2002 an article was published concerning research done in Tehran, Iran. The research focused on six late prehistoric sites which coincidentally had a large focus of blade production. The main focus of the paper concentrated on the early Chalcolithic and showed that as time passed and the chopper tools became more prominent, stone tools became less aesthetically pleasing. Thus, there was a collapse of lithic craft specialization. Wherein raw material was being sent out and coming back in as blades, people were producing their own blades at home. The raw materials that these tools were made of were also very diverse. 92% of the Chalcolithic tool variety was a product of chert, a sedimentary rock indigenous to the area and easily harvested. Other raw materials found in the collection, such as obsidian, suggested that trading and expeditions were sources for blade cores, too, as these raw materials were not readily available. The provenance of parts of a culture&#x27;s material culture illuminates common trade patterns and needs of that society for archaeologists. If the resources are not available, how they traded these raw materials such as obsidian to improve their blades and stone tool technology.

Likewise, the blades and blade cores located in the Ambergris Caye Museum dated to Mayan inhabitation showed heavy reliance on obsidian. Because obsidian is not natural to Belize, the site of excavation, the obsidian cores were the product of transactions between the Mayans and those in present-day Honduras, Mexico and Guatemala. Obsidian blades are the sharpest natural cutting edges known, and after the lithic reduction already fractured blades, the triangular heads were produced. These obsidian blades were used as the Mayans&#x27; primary cutting utensil. During the 1890s in California, obsidian blades held significant cultural value and were seen as heirlooms within certain tribes. Many were reluctant to show these blades which were usually hidden away where only the owner knew the location until it was passed down.

<text>Mary Ellen Weber (born August 24, 1962) is an American executive, scientist, aviator, and a former NASA astronaut.

== Education ==
Weber was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Bedford Heights, Ohio. She graduated from Bedford High School in 1980; received a B.S. in 1984 in chemical engineering (with honors) from Purdue University, where she was a member of Phi Mu sorority; received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley in 1988; and received an M.B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 2002.

== Pre-NASA career ==
As an undergrad, Weber was a chemical engineering intern at Ohio Edison, Delco Electronics, and 3M. In her doctoral research at Berkeley, she explored the physics of chemical reactions involving silicon. At Texas Instruments she researched new processes and revolutionary equipment for making computer chips, with SEMATECH and Applied Materials. She holds one patent and published nine papers in scientific journals.

== NASA career ==
Weber was selected by NASA in the fourteenth group of astronauts in 1992. During her ten-year career with NASA, she held several positions. She worked extensively in technology commercialization, and as part of a team reporting to NASA&#x27;s chief executive, she worked directly with a venture capital firm to successfully identify and develop a business venture leveraging a space technology. In addition, Weber was the Legislative Affairs liaison at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C., interfacing with Congress and traveling with NASA&#x27;s chief executive. Prior to this appointment, she was chairman of the procurement board for the Biotechnology Program contractor, and she also served on a team that revamped the $2 billion plan for Space Station research facilities. Weber&#x27;s principal technical assignments within the Astronaut Office included Shuttle launch preparations at the Kennedy Space Center, payload and science development, and development of standards and methods for crew science training. A veteran of two space flights, STS-70 and STS-101, she was among the youngest to fly in space and she logged over 450 hours. She is the recipient of the NASA Exceptional Service Medal. She resigned from NASA in December 2002.

=== Spaceflight experience ===
==== STS-70 ====

Weber was mission specialist 3 on the crew of STS-70.
Discovery launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B July 13, 1995, 13:41:55.078 UTC, STS-70 successfully delivered to orbit a critical $200 million NASA communications satellite, TDRS-G to its 22-thousand-mile orbit above the equator. Weber deployed the satellite and also performed pioneering biotechnology experiments, growing colon cancer tissues never before possible to later become a leading NASA biotechnology spokesperson in this field. She was the prime spacewalk crewmember in the event a malfunction required a spacewalk, crew medical officer, and flight deck crew member for landing. STS-70 was known for its &quot;All-Ohio crew&quot; and for its last-minute launch delay due to woodpeckers, becoming the &quot;Woodpecker flight.&quot; The STS-70 mission was completed with a successful landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility July 22, 1995, 12:02 UTC after 142 orbits of the Earth, after traveling 3.7 million miles in 214 hours and 20 minutes.

==== STS-101 ====

Weber was mission specialist 1 on the crew of STS-101.
Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39B May 19, 2000, 10:11 UTC. STS-101 was the third Shuttle mission devoted to International Space Station construction—a critical mission, with no mission to the fledgling Station in over a year and batteries failing. The crew repaired and installed electrical and life-support components, both inside and out, and boosted the Station to a safe orbit. Weber was a flight deck crew member for launch, landing and Station rendezvous, drove Atlantis&#x27; 60-foot robotic arm to maneuver spacewalk crewmembers along the Station surface, and directed the logistics and transfer of over three thousand pounds of equipment. She also developed new crew checklists for engine failures during ascent and new procedures for robotic arm operations. The STS-101 mission—the subject of an A&amp;E documentary, Mission Possible—was completed with successful landing at the Shuttle Landing Facility May 29, 2000, 06:20 UTC after 155 orbits of the Earth, after traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 9 minutes.

== Post-NASA career ==
Weber is currently with Stellar Strategies, LLC, providing consulting services in strategies for operations in high-stakes business ventures, technology communications, and legislative strategy. She is also a speaker, with over twenty years of experience with a wide range of audiences and venues.

Prior to STELLAR Strategies, Weber was vice president for Government Affairs and Policy for nine years at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.

<text>Mary Douglas Leakey, FBA (née Nicol, 6 February 1913 – 9 December 1996) was a British paleoanthropologist who discovered the first fossilised &quot;Proconsul&quot; skull, an extinct ape which is now believed to be ancestral to humans. She also discovered the robust &quot;Zinjanthropus&quot; skull at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, eastern Africa. For much of her career she worked with her husband, Louis Leakey, at Olduvai Gorge, where they uncovered fossils of ancient hominines and the earliest hominins, as well as the stone tools produced by the latter group. Mary Leakey developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at Olduvai. She discovered the Laetoli footprints, and at the Laetoli site she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old.

During her career, Leakey discovered fifteen new species of animal. She also brought about the naming of a new genus.

In 1972, after the death of her husband, Leakey became director of excavations at Olduvai. She maintained the Leakey family tradition of palaeoanthropology by training her son, Richard, in the field.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Mary Leakey was born on 6 February 1913, in London, England to Erskine Edward Nicol and Cecilia Marion (Frere) Nicol. The Nicol family moved to numerous locations in thе United States, Italy, and Egypt where Erskine painted watercolours that he brought back and sold in England. Mary began to develop an enthusiasm for Egyptology during these travels.

On her mother&#x27;s side, Mary was a third great-granddaughter of antiquarian John Frere and shared this same ancestry with historian and archaeologist Sheppard Frere. The Frere family had been active abolitionists in the British colonial empire during the 19th century and established several communities for freed slaves. Three of these communities were still in existence when Leakey published her 1984 autobiography: Freretown, Kenya; Freretown, South Africa; and Freretown, India.

The Nicols spent much of their time in southern France where young Mary became fluent in French. In 1925, when Mary was 12, the Nicols stayed at the commune, Les Eyzies, at a time when Élie Peyrony, a French archaeologist and prehistorian, was excavating a cave there. Peyrony was not excavating scientifically during that early stage of archaeology and did not understand the significance of much of what he found. Mary received permission to go through the remnants of his dig. This was where her interests in prehistory and archaeology were sparked. She started a collection of points, scrapers, and blades from the dump and developed her first system of classification.

The family relocated to Cabrerets, a village of Lot, France. Mary met Abbé Lemozi, the village priest, who befriended her and became her mentor for a time. The two toured Pech Merle cave to view the prehistoric paintings of bison and horses.

===Education===
In the spring of 1926, when Mary was thirteen years old, her father died of cancer and Mary and her mother returned to London. Mary was placed in a local Catholic convent to be educated, and she later boasted of never passing an examination there. Although she spoke fluent French, Mary did not excel at French language studies, apparently because her teacher frowned upon her provincial accent. She was expelled for refusing to recite poetry, and was later expelled from a second convent school for causing an explosion in a chemistry laboratory. After the second expulsion, her mother hired two tutors, who were no more successful than the nuns. After the unsuccessful tutors, her mother hired a nanny.

Mary&#x27;s particular interests centered on illustration and archaeology, but formal university admission was impossible with her academic record. Her mother contacted a professor at Oxford University about possible admission, and was encouraged not to apply, as it would be a waste of her time. Mary had no further contact with the university until it awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 1951.

The small family moved to Kensington, in West London, where, though unregistered, Mary attended lectures in archaeology and related subjects at University College and at the London Museum, where she studied under Mortimer Wheeler.

Mary applied to work on a number of summer excavations. Wheeler was the first to accept her for a dig. It took place at St. Albans at the Roman site of Verulamium. Her next dig was at Hembury, a Neolithic site, under Dorothy Liddell, who trained her for four years until 1934. Her illustrations of tools for Liddell drew the attention of Gertrude Caton Thompson, and, in late 1932, she entered the field as an illustrator for Caton Thompson&#x27;s book &quot;The Desert Fayoum&quot;.

===Life===

Through Caton Thompson, an English archaeologist, Mary met Louis Leakey, who was in need of an illustrator for his book &quot;Adam&#x27;s Ancestors&quot; (1934). While she was doing that work they became romantically involved. Leakey was still married and his son Collin had just been born when they moved in with each other. They married after Frida Leakey divorced him in 1936. This ruined his career at Cambridge University.

Mary and Louis Leakey had three sons: Jonathan, born in 1940, Richard in 1944, and Philip in 1949. Their fourth child, a daughter, died as a baby. The three boys received much of their early childhood care at various anthropological sites and, whenever possible, the Leakeys excavated and explored as a family. The children accompanied them to various work sites, with dig becoming a family endeavour. The boys grew up with the same love of freedom that their parents had become accustomed to. Mary would not even allow guests to shoo away the pet hyraxes that helped themselves to food and drink at the dinner table. In her autobiography, she rarely mentioned her pregnancies or the difficulties she faced while raising children in Kenya. She smoked a lot, first cigarettes and then cigars, and usually dressed as though completing an excavation.

While her husband was alive, they published many joint findings. However, her contributions were often credited to her husband. Louis Leakey died on 1 October 1972 of a heart attack. Mary Leakey continued with the family&#x27;s archaeological work, becoming a respected figure in paleoanthropology in her own right. Her son, Richard Leakey, also decided to become a paleoanthropologist, and Mary helped him begin his career. Her other two sons, Jonathan and Philip Leakey, pursued other interests.

===Death===
Mary Leakey died on 9 December 1996, in Nairobi, Kenya, at the age of 83. Her family, who announced her death, did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.

==Research==
Mary Leakey served her apprenticeship under Dorothy Liddell at Hembury, 1930–34 (see above). In 1934, she took part in a dig at Swanscombe where she discovered the largest elephant tooth known to Britain at that time.

Throughout the 1930s to 1950s, Mary and Louis Leakey worked at Later Stone Age, Neolithic, and Iron Age archaeological sites in central Kenya, such as Hyrax Hill and Njoro River Cave. In October 1948, Mary discovered a &quot;Proconsul africanus&quot; skull on Rusinga Island. Mary Leakey also recorded and published the Kondoa Irangi Rock Paintings in central Tanzania.

The Leakeys&#x27; most famous research, however, was at Olduvai Gorge in the Serengeti plains of northern Tanzania. The site yielded many stone tools, from Oldowan choppers to multi-purpose hand axes. The earliest tools they dug up were likely made by &quot;Homo habilis&quot; and can be dated to over two million years ago.

On the morning of 17 July 1959, Louis felt ill at Olduvai and stayed at camp while Mary went out to the field. At some point she noticed a piece of bone that &quot;seemed to be part of a skull&quot; with a &quot;hominid&quot; look&quot;. After dusting the topsoil away, she found &quot;two large teeth set in the curve of a jaw&quot;, and she drove back to camp exclaiming &quot;I&#x27;ve got him!&quot; Active excavation began the following day and a partial cranium was unearthed within a few weeks, though it had to be reconstructed from fragments scattered in the scree. After examining the cranium, Louis Leakey concluded it was of a species ancestral to humans, the australopithecines.
He eventually dubbed the find &quot;Zinjanthropus boisei&quot;, &quot;East Africa man&quot;—&quot;Zinj&quot; is an ancient Arabic word for the East African coast. The name was later revised to &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot;, and by some to &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;; a consensus on its classification is still in debate.

In the 1960s the Leakeys started to work with the young Kamoya Kimeu with Mary particularly valuing his expertise. The family trained him in paleontology, evolutionary theory and excavating techniques, which he then trained the next generations of Kenyan fossil finders in, as he became a highly respected Kenyan paleontologist and curator.

After her husband died in 1972, Mary Leakey continued their work at Olduvai and Laetoli. It was at the Laetoli site that she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old.

From 1976 to 1981, Leakey and her staff uncovered the Laetoli hominin footprint trail which had been tracked through a layer of volcanic ash some 3.6 million years ago. The subsequent years were filled with research at Olduvai and Laetoli, follow-up work to discoveries, and preparing publications.

Throughout her career, Leakey discovered 15 new species of animals, and one new genus. She was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.

==Legacy==
In April 2013, Leakey was honoured by Royal Mail in the UK, as one of six people selected as subjects for the &quot;Great Britons&quot; commemorative postage stamp issue. Google celebrated the 100th anniversary of Mary Leakey&#x27;s birth with its Google doodle for 6 February 2013.

The Mary Leakey Girls&#x27; High School, a secondary school for girls near Kikuyu Town, was named after Mary&#x27;s mother-in-law, Mary Bazett Leakey, mother of her husband, Louis Leakey.

In the video game &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, Leakey is a Great Scientist that players can recruit. Her unique ability grants extra science and tourism to artifacts.

Yurchikhin was one of five cosmonauts selected to raise the Russian flag at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony.

== Experience ==
After graduating from the S. Ordzhonikidze Moscow Aviation Institute, Yurchikhin worked at the Russian Space Corporation Energia from September 1983 until August 1997. He began working as a controller in the Russian Mission Control Center, and held the positions of engineer, senior engineer, and lead engineer, eventually becoming a lead engineer for Shuttle-Mir and NASA-Mir programs.

== Roscosmos career ==
In August 1997, he was enrolled in the RSC Energia cosmonaut detachment as a cosmonaut-candidate. From January 1998 to November 1999, he completed his basic training course. In November 1999, he was qualified as a test cosmonaut. In January 2000, he started training in the test-cosmonaut group for the International Space Station (ISS) program.

=== STS-112 ===
Yurchikhin was a crewmember of the International Space Station assembly mission STS-112 conducted using . During the mission the shuttle crew conducted joint operations with the Expedition 5 by delivering and installing the S1 Truss (the third piece of the station&#x27;s 11-piece Integrated Truss Structure). Three spacewalks were required to outfit and activate the new component. The crew also transferred cargo between the two vehicles and used the shuttle&#x27;s thruster jets during two maneuvers to raise the station&#x27;s orbit. STS-112 was the first shuttle mission to use a camera on the External Tank, providing a live view of the launch to flight controllers and NASA TV viewers. The STS-112 mission was accomplished in 170 orbits, traveling in 10 days, 19 hours, and 58 minutes.

=== Expedition 15 ===
In 2007, he became a member of the Expedition 15 on the ISS. His flight began on April 7, when he launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, aboard Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft, together with Oleg Kotov and space tourist Charles Simonyi. Yurchikhin was aboard when Simonyi gave a live telebridge conversation on 17 April 2007. He served as the commander of the Expedition 15 mission.

On 21 October 2007, he returned to Earth inside the Soyuz TMA-10 capsule after spending 196 days and 17 hours in space. The Soyuz TMA-10 spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 07:14 UTC on 21 October 2007, and deorbit occurred at 09:47 UTC. During atmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft transitioned to a ballistic reentry, resulting in it landing west of Arkalyk, approximately northwest of the intended Kazakhstan landing site.

=== Expedition 24/25 ===
Yurchikhin served as a flight engineer for the Expedition 24/25 long-duration missions to the ISS. On 16 June 2010, Yurchikhin along with NASA astronauts Douglas Wheelock and Shannon Walker lifted off aboard the Soyuz TMA-19 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. He also served as the commander of the Soyuz TMA-19 spacecraft.

During his second long stay aboard the ISS, Yurhikhin participated in two spacewalks in support of station&#x27;s maintenance and staging new experiments in the exterior of the orbiting complex. On 26 July 2010, Yurchikhin and fellow Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko performed a spacewalk outside the space station. On 15 November 2010, Yurchikhin again participated in a spacewalk with cosmonaut and Expedition 25/26 flight engineer Oleg Skripochka.

On 18 October 2010, Yurchikhin took part in the all-Russian census from space. He answered questions for the census collectors during a linkup with the Mission Control Center outside Moscow.

Yurchikhin returned to Earth on 26 November 2010 after spending 163 days aboard the ISS. Soyuz TMA-19 carrying the trio of Yurchikhin, Wheelock and Walker undocked from the space station at 01:23:13 UTC After a nominal descent, the Soyuz TMA-19 descent module landed on the central steppes of Kazakhstan at 04:46 UTC After the successful landing, Yurchikhin headed for Star City – the home of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Russia.

=== Expedition 36/37 ===
Yurchikhin served as Soyuz commander aboard Soyuz TMA-09M which launched to the ISS on 28 May 2013, docking some six hours later, with fellow crewmembers NASA astronaut Karen Nyberg and ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano. He served as flight engineer for Expedition 36, and as ISS commander for Expedition 37. For a short time Yurchikhin was commander to a crew of nine, after the docking of Soyuz TMA-11M on 7 November 2013, with four astronaut corps represented between the nine crewmembers (Roscosmos, NASA, ESA, JAXA).

The three returned to Earth aboard their Soyuz on 11 November 2013.

=== Expedition 51/52 ===
Yurchikhin launched aboard Soyuz MS-04 for his fifth spaceflight to the ISS on 20 April 2017, with his crew member Jack D. Fischer. Soyuz MS-04 was the first of the Soyuz-MS series to rendezvous and dock with the ISS using the 6 hours profile, as opposed to the previous 2 days rendezvous procedure. He served as a flight engineer for Expedition 51, and on 1 June 2017, assumed command of the ISS over from crewmember Peggy Whitson.

Yurchikhin handed over the station command to Randy Bresnik on 2 September 2017, and returned to Earth along with Peggy Whitson and Jack D. Fischer aboard Soyuz MS-04 on 3 September 2017. The overall duration of his stay in space during Expedition 51/52 was 135 days, 18 hours and 8 minutes.

After Expedition 51/52, Yurchikhin cumulative duration in space is 672 days 20 hours and 38 minutes.

=== Spacewalk summary ===
On 30 May 2007, at 19:05 UTC, Yurchikhin began his first spacewalk from the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock. He and fellow cosmonaut Oleg Kotov performed a five-hour and 25 minute spacewalk, during which they installed protective panels to shield ISS from space debris.

On 6 June 2007, Yurchikhin performed his second spacewalk from the &quot;Pirs&quot; docking compartment airlock. The two spacewalkers installed a section of Ethernet cable on the &quot;Zarya&quot; module, installed additional Service Module Debris Protection (SMDP) panels on &quot;Zvezda&quot;, and deployed a Russian scientific experiment. Yurchikhin and Kotov returned to the ISS at 20:00 UTC to wound up the five hours, 37 minutes spacewalk.

On 23 July 2007, Yurchikhin participated in his third spacewalk along with NASA astronaut Clayton Anderson. He emerged from the U.S. &quot;Quest&quot; airlock at 10:24 UTC, to officially begin the spacewalk. During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Anderson removed and jettisoned the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS), installed a television camera stanchion, reconfigured a power supply for an antenna assembly, and performed several get-ahead tasks. The spacewalk lasted seven hours and 41 minutes.

On 26 July 2010, Yurchikhin and fellow Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko performed a spacewalk outside the space station. The two cosmonauts on 23 July 2010 put on their Orlan space suits and performed a dry run of the spacewalk activities. From inside the Pirs docking compartment they checked out the Orlan systems, practiced translation movements and tested their mobility. During the spacewalk (Russian EVA #25), Yurchikhin and Kornienko outfitted the Rassvet module&#x27;s (MRM-1) Kurs automated rendezvous system, installed cables and remove and replaced a video camera. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 42 minutes.

On 15 November 2010, Yurchikhin participated in a spacewalk with cosmonaut and Expedition 25 flight engineer Oleg Skripochka. At 13:25 UTC, he and Skripochka ventured into space outside the ISS from the Pirs airlock to conduct Russian EVA #26. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 27 minutes. It was the fifth for Yurchikhin, who was in the spacesuit marked with red stripes. The two cosmonauts removed Kontur and Expose-R scientific experiments. The Kontur experiment studied remote object control capability for robotic arms and the Expose-R experiment is a European Space Agency experiment designed to expose organic material to the extreme environment of space. During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Skripochka also installed a portable multipurpose workstation on the Zvezda service module and installed handrail extensions between the Poisk module and both Zvezda and Zarya modules. They performed an experiment called Test, which is aimed at verifying the existence of microorganisms or contamination underneath insulation on the Russian segment of the ISS. Yurchikhin and Skripochka removed a television camera from the Rassvet module, however they were not able to relocate the camera due to interference with insulation where it was to be installed.

On 24 June 2013, Yurchikhin performed a spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. The two spacewalkers exited the Space Station&#x27;s Pirs docking compartment with the primary goal of preparing for the addition of a new Russian module. The Orlan-MK space suits of Yurchikhin and Misurkin were equipped with NASA helmet cameras to provide close-up views of their work. During the spacewalk, Yurchikhin and Misurkin replaced a fluid flow control panel on the Zarya module. They also installed clamps for future power cables as an early step toward swapping the Pirs airlock with the new Nauka module planned to launch in 2021. The two cosmonauts also retrieved two science experiments and installed one new one. The spacewalk lasted six hours and 34 minutes.

On 16 August 2013, Yurchikhin performed his seventh spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. They first set up a Strela cargo boom on the Poisk module. Misurkin used the Strela boom to maneuver Yurchikhin with cables and Yurchikhin rerouted a cable connector and installed cables on the Zarya module. The cable work outside the station was to prepare the ISS for the planned arrival of the Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) – &quot;Nauka&quot;. The spacewalk ended at seven hours, 29 minutes when the cosmonauts closed the Pirs docking compartment hatch and re-entered the space station. The spacewalk set a new Russian spacewalk record, eclipsing the old mark of seven hours and 16 minutes set by two cosmonauts outside the Mir space station in July 1990. However, the record held by Yurchikhin and Misurkin was soon eclipsed by cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky when they performed an eight hours, seven minutes spacewalk on 27 December 2013.

On 22 August 2013, Yurchikhin performed his eight spacewalk with cosmonaut Alexander Misurkin. The cosmonauts exited the Pirs docking compartment and moved out to the first worksite on the Zvezda service module. Yurchikhin and Misurkin removed an External Onboard Laser Communications System, installed on the Zvezda module during an earlier spacewalk in August 2011. Next the spacewalkers successfully installed a camera platform on the starboard side of Zvezda module. Initially, Russian mission controllers advised Yurchikhin and Misurkin to stand down on the installation operations, due to a misaligned base plate issue in the camera platform. However, upon discovering that the problem could be fixed after its installation, the mission controllers gave the go ahead for the installation. Misurkin and Yurchikhin also headed to various sites on the Zvezda module to inspect the antenna covers and tighten screws on six antennas used for providing navigation data during ATV cargo ship rendezvous and docking operations. Yurchikhin also completed the installation of some devices called &quot;gap spanners&quot; used to help spacewalkers in their movements between the space station modules. The spacewalk lasted five hours and 58 minutes.

On 17 August 2017, Yurchikhin performed his ninth spacewalk with cosmonaut Sergey Ryazansky. The cosmonauts tested a new version of the Orlan space suit, deploying five nanosatellites and installing external experiments. Spacewalk lasted of 7 hours, 34 minutes.

Yurchikhin is currently seventh on the list of cumulative spacewalk records, with 59 hours, 28 minutes during his 9 spacewalks.

<text>A golf cart (alternatively known as a golf buggy or golf car) is a small motorized vehicle designed originally to carry two golfers and their golf clubs around a golf course with less effort than walking. Over time, variants were introduced that were capable of carrying more passengers, had additional utility features, or were certified as a street legal low-speed vehicle.

A traditional golf cart, capable of carrying two golfers and their clubs, is generally around wide, long and high, weighing between and capable of speeds up to about . The golf carts usually have four wheels, although the three-wheeled autoettes were marketed, among other uses, for golfing.

==History==
Reportedly, the first use of a motorized cart on a golf course was by JK Wadley of Texarkana, who saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in Los Angeles to transport senior citizens to a grocery store. Later, he purchased a cart and found that it worked poorly on a golf course. The first electric golf cart was custom-made in 1932, but did not gain widespread acceptance. In the 1930s until the 1950s the most widespread use of golf carts was for those with disabilities who could not walk far. By the mid-1950s the golf cart had gained wide acceptance with US golfers.
Merle Williams of Long Beach, California, was an early innovator of the electric golf cart. He started with knowledge gained from the production of electric cars due to World War II gasoline rationing. In 1951 his Marketeer Company began production of an electric golf cart in Redlands, California. E-Z-Go began producing golf cars in 1954, Cushman in 1955, Club Car in 1958, Taylor-Dunn in 1961, Harley-Davidson in 1963, Melex in 1971, Yamaha Golf Car in 1979 and CT&amp;T in 2002.

Max Walker created the first gasoline-powered golf cart &quot;The Walker Executive&quot; in 1957. This three-wheeled vehicle was shaped with a Vespa-style front end and, like any golf cart, carried two passengers and golf bags.

In 1963 the Harley-Davidson Motor Company began producing golf carts. Over the years they manufactured and distributed thousands of three- and four-wheeled gasoline-powered and electric vehicles that are still highly sought after. The iconic three-wheeled cart, with either a steering wheel or a tiller-based steering control, boasted a reversible two-stroke engine similar to the one used today in some high-end snowmobiles. (The engine runs clockwise in forward mode.) Harley Davidson sold the production of golf carts to American Machine and Foundry Company, who in turn sold production to Columbia Par Car. Many of these units survive today, and are the prized possessions of proud owners, restorers, and collectors worldwide.
==Types of golf carts==

=== Utility vehicle ===

Many golf cart manufacturers offer models configured as small utility vehicles (UTV), a type of side-by-side. Originally developed for golf course operations, these UTVs were available with small pickup beds, flatbeds, dump style beds, van boxes, or with coolers and cabinets for drink and snack sales. With the growing popularity of the side-by-side, many manufacturers are now offering models equipped for use on rugged, off-road terrain.

=== Transport vehicles ===
Many golf cart manufacturers offer models configured as transportation vehicles, with no provision to carry golf bags. These vehicles are often used in low-speed, off-road applications such as on school campuses, resort properties, or inside airport terminals. These transport variants can range from a simple conversion of a traditional golf cart, swapping the golf bag carrier for a second rear-facing seat, to a stretched cart offering additional rows of seating for 4, 6, or 8 people.

=== Solar-powered golf carts ===

Solar golf carts are powered by mounting a photovoltaic panel on top of the cart. A controller converts the sun&#x27;s energy to charge the cart&#x27;s battery pack. Not only does the solar power take the cart off the electric grid, it also increases the driving distance.

Solar conversion kits have been available for golf carts and low-speed vehicles (LSV) for several years. These kits range from low wattage solar battery chargers to a 410-watt array on an 8-passenger transport cart. Kits utilizing flexible solar panels are often preferred on golf carts due to their light weight and ability to conform to the shape of the cart roof. Buyers can take a solar tax credit of 30% of the purchase price on their US Federal Income Tax.

Solar-powered golf carts are popular with owners who drive long distances, such as maintenance workers, golf course fleets, staff at the Detroit Zoo, transportation vehicles in resorts and cities, and drivers of VIP carts on college campuses. High schools have used them as teaching tools for solar power.

==Golf cart communities==
* Peachtree City, Georgia has many miles of golf cart paths that link the city together. Children aged twelve or over may operate a cart on Peachtree City cart paths with a parent, grandparent, or guardian in the front seat. Unaccompanied fifteen-year-olds with valid Georgia learner&#x27;s permits can operate golf carts alone. Golf cart travel is used by a great majority of the community, especially among high school students. McIntosh High School and Starr&#x27;s Mill High School have student golf cart parking lots on their campuses.
* On certain islands (such as Santa Catalina Island, California; Bald Head Island, North Carolina; North Captiva Island, Florida; and Hamilton Island, Queensland, Australia), motor vehicles are sometimes restricted, and residents use golf carts instead.
* The Villages, Florida, a retirement community of over 140,000 people, has an extensive golf cart trail system (estimated at ) and also allows golf carts on many streets. It is the most popular form of transportation in this community.
* On the tropical islands of Belize, golf carts are a significant form of road transport and can be rented by tourists.
* The residential community of Discovery Bay, Hong Kong does not allow the use of private vehicles apart from a fleet of 520 golf carts &quot;(excluding the ones operating exclusively in the Golf or the Marina Clubs)&quot;. The remainder of the 20,000 residents rely on a mixture of shuttle buses and hire cars to travel around the township.
* The Palm Springs Area in California contains multiple golf cart communities, including PGA West, The Madison Club, The Hideaway, and many other golf course/golf cart communities. The PGA Tour is held at PGA West every January.

==Safety==
Along with the rising frequency of golf cart crashes, the number of golf-cart-related injuries has increased significantly over the last decades. A study conducted by researchers in the Center for Injury Research and Policy of The Research Institute at the Nationwide Children&#x27;s Hospital found that the number of golf cart-related injuries rose 132% during the 17-year study period. According to the study, published in the July 2008 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, there were an estimated 148,000 golf cart-related injuries between 1990 and 2006, ranging from an estimated 5,770 cases in 1990 to approximately 13,411 cases in 2006. More than 30% of golf cart-related injuries involved children under the age of 16.

The most common type of injury was soft tissue damage, usually just bruises, followed by fractures, constituting 22.3% of the cases, and lacerations, accounting for 15.5% of injuries. Other types of injuries include concussions, internal injuries, subdural hematoma, spinal cord injury, or acute respiratory compromise. While rare, a few cases had severe outcomes: 4 fatalities, 2 paraplegic, and 1 quadriplegic injuries have been documented.

Some of the main causes of injury related to golf cart accidents included cart overturn, falling/jumping from a moving golf cart, collision with another vehicle or stationary object, struck/run over by a cart, getting into or out of a moving cart. Out of all these, &quot;falling or jumping from a golf cart&quot; was the most common cause of injury for both adults and children.

One contributing reason is that current golf cart safety features are insufficient to prevent passenger falls or ejection. Golf carts moving at speeds as low as could readily eject a passenger during a turn. Furthermore, rear-facing golf cart seats are associated with high rates of passenger ejection during fast acceleration, and most standard (stock) golf carts do not have brakes on all four wheels (typically brakes are only on the rear wheels, thus sharply limiting their braking power).

== Legislation ==
Arizona has a large snowbird population, and many of them live in large RV parks or retirement communities that use golf carts to get around.
In 2014, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed a law permitting golf cart drivers to drive as close to the right-hand edge of the roadway as possible. Prior to the passage of the law, golf cart drivers received traffic tickets for failing to drive in the center of the roadway. Complementing the new law, a golf cart safety education program was initiated.
== Rail carts ==
Petrol powered golf carts have been converted with rail wheels for carrying passengers at up to on several former railways. Awakeri Rail Adventures operate carts on a part of the former Tāneatua branch, Forgotten World Adventures on of the former Stratford–Okahukura Line, and Dargaville Rail Carts on a section of the rail track from Dargaville branch to Tangowahine. Similar vehicles are run by Andrews Valley Rail Tours on of the Murphy Branch at Andrews and RailCruiser from Tārukenga, to Mamaku on the former Rotorua branch.

<text>Dorinne K. Kondo is a professor of American studies and Ethnicity and Anthropology at the University of Southern California. She is a scholar, playwright, and has over 20 years of work experience in dramaturge; her work shows the structural inequality of race and ethnicities in the world of contemporary theatre. Her writings discuss issues on power, gender inequality, the discourses in a Japanese workplace, and racism in the fashion industry.

Kondo suffered a cardiac incident in which one of her valves was leaking. Her book launch for Worldmaking&quot;: Race, Performance and the Work of Creativity&quot;, was postponed three years due to her open-heart surgery.

== Education ==
Kondo&#x27;s education was fully focalized on Anthropology. She received her Bachelor of Anthropology from Stanford University in 1975. She continued her studies by taking her Masters in Anthropology in Harvard University in 1978. She then obtained her Ph.D. in Anthropology in Harvard University in 1982. Dorinne Kondo has specialized in research after finishing her Ph.D. at Harvard University. She practiced research and taught as an Assistant Professor of Anthropology in Harvard University 1982. Her research was on race and power, performance studies, theories of subject, and cultural theory.

=== Degrees ===
* Ph.D., Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, 1982
*M.A., Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, 1978
*B.A., Phi Beta Kappa, Departmental Honors, Distinction, Department of Anthropology, Stanford University, 1975

Kondo had multiple postdoctoral training from (1987-2002), such as in:
* Fellow, University of California, Irvine Humanities Research Institute, Spring 2002 
* Research Fellow, Getty Research Institute, 2000-2001 
* Institute of American Cultures Postdoctoral Fellow, UCLA, 1993-1994 
* Fellow, University of California, Irvine Humanities Research Institute, Fall 1993 
* Rockefeller Fellow, Rice University, 1989-1990 
* Rockefeller Fellow, The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, 1987-1988

== Career ==

Kondo is a professor and started her career as an Assistant Professor of Anthropology in Harvard University for seven years from 1982 to 1989. She became a MacArthur Associate Professor of Women&#x27;s Studies and Anthropology; later on she was appointed to be a Full Professor in 1997 at Pomona College. She is now a Professor of Anthropology and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California and she has been at the University of Southern California since 1997.

Her career mainly focused on gender studies and ethnology as she has now portrayed her knowledge on discrimination and gender inequality in her dramaturge and playwright. In her book &quot;Worldmaking: Race, Performance and the Work of Creativity&quot;, Kondo posits the racialized constructions of imbalance that pervade theater and the arts. Grounded in twenty years of hands on work as dramaturge and writer, Kondo activates critical race researches, influence hypothesis, analysis, and emotional composition to abrasively break down performance center&#x27;s work of inventiveness as hypothesis: acting, writing, and dramaturgy.

Her other book &quot;About Face&quot; analyzes representations of Asia and their resonations in both Asia and Asian American lives. Japanese high fashion and Asian American theater become points of passage into the political issues of pleasure, the presentation of racial personalities, the possibility of political intervention in commodity capitalism. In view of Kondo&#x27;s hands on work, this interdisciplinary work unites papers, interviews with fashioner Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons and dramatist David Henry Hwang, and &quot;individual&quot; vignettes in its investigation of counter-orientalism.

Paul H. Noguchi, an American Anthropologist, commented on Kondo&#x27;s book &quot;Crafting Selves&quot;:
&quot;The ethnography of Japan is currently being reshaped by a new generation of Japanologists, and the present work certainly deserves a place in this body of literature. . . . The combination of utility with beauty makes Kondo’s book required reading, for those with an interest not only in Japan but also in reflexive anthropology, women’s studies, field methods, the anthropology of work, social psychology, Asian Americans, and even modern literature.&quot;

<doc id="677347" wikidata="Q1331366" url="?curid=677347" title="USS Drum (SS-228)">
<text>USS &quot;Drum&quot; (SS-228) is a of the United States Navy, the first Navy ship named after the drum, a type of fish. &quot;Drum&quot; is a museum ship in Mobile, Alabama, at Battleship Memorial Park.

&quot;Drum&quot; was the twelfth of the &quot;Gato&quot; class but was the first completed and the first to enter combat in World War II. She is the oldest of her class still in existence.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Drum&quot; was laid down on 11 September 1940 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 12 May 1941, sponsored by Mrs. Beatrice M. Holcomb, wife of Major General Thomas Holcomb, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. &quot;Drum&quot; was commissioned on 1 November 1941, with Commander Robert H. Rice in command.

==Service history==
===November 1941–April 1942===
After shakedown training, &quot;Drum&quot; set out to join the war in the Pacific, which began with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. An Allied aircraft mistook her for a German U-boat and attacked her as she made the transit from the United States East Coast to the Panama Canal, probably in March 1942.

&quot;Drum&quot; arrived at Naval Station Pearl Harbor at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 1 April 1942. She departed Pearl Harbor on 14 April 1942 and proceeded to Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

===First war patrol===
&quot;Drum&quot; departed Midway Atoll to begin her first war patrol. Cruising off the coast of Japan, she sank the Japanese seaplane tender &quot;Mizuho&quot; on 2 May and afterwards endured a 16-hour depth charge attack consisting of 31 depth charges. Later that month she sank three cargo ships (first unidentified, second: &quot;Shonan Maru&quot; (5000 BRT) third &quot;Kitakata Maru&quot; (2300 BRT) ) before returning to Pearl Harbor on 12 June to refit. For her efforts, the crew were awarded the Submarine Combat Patrol insignia.

===Second war patrol===
&quot;Drum&quot;″s second war patrol, which she made in the waters between Truk and Kavieng from 10 July2 September, found her efforts frustrated by poor torpedo performance, but she damaged one freighter before returning to Midway to refit.

===Third war patrol===
The submarine sailed from Midway on 23 September on her third war patrol, bound for the eastern coast of Kyūshū. On 8 October, she contacted a convoy of four freighters, and defying the air cover guarding the ships, sank the 5652 ton cargo/passenger ship IJA &quot;Hague Maru&quot; laden with 4000 tons of wheat, machines, steel, oil, automobiles and captured paper money for the Formosa bank, before aerial bombs forced her deep. The next day, &quot;Drum&quot; underwent a severe depth charging from several escorts after she attacked and sank the 2461 ton cargo ship &quot;Hachimanzan Maru&quot;. On 20 October, she sank the 5106 ton &quot;Ryunan Maru&quot;, one of three air-escorted cargo ships, and damaged at least two more ships before completing her patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 November.

===Fourth war patrol===
On her fourth patrol, 29 November 194224 January 1943, &quot;Drum&quot; carried out the demanding task of planting mines in heavily traveled Bungo Suido. On 12 December, she spotted the Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūhō, which had a full deck-load of planes. Although taking water forward due to faulty valves, &quot;Drum&quot; launched torpedoes at this choice target, scoring two hits, and causing the carrier to list so far that her flight deck became completely visible. Also visible was a destroyer bearing down, and splashes that indicated &quot;Drum&quot;″s periscope was under fire. As the submarine dove, she lost depth control and her port shaft stopped turning. As she made emergency repairs, she underwent two waves of depth charging. When she surfaced several hours later to see what had become of her prey, which had escaped, an aircraft forced her down again. During this patrol, &quot;Drum&quot; also damaged a large tanker, another choice target.

===Fifth and sixth war patrols===

After a thorough overhaul at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Drum&quot; made her fifth war patrol, 24 March13 May, searching waters south of Truk after she had completed a photographic reconnaissance of Nauru. She sank the cargo vessel &quot;Yuzan (Oyama) Maru&quot; of 3809 tons on 9 April, and on 18 April she sank the 6380 ton cargo ship &quot;Nisshun Maru&quot;, carrying a cargo of ammunition, then refitted at Brisbane, Australia. Her sixth war patrol, 7 June26 July, found her north of the Bismarck Archipelago, where on 17 June she found a 3 ship convoy consisting of 2 cargo ships under escort by a destroyer and sank the 5086 ton cargo-passenger ship &quot;Myoko Maru&quot;.

===Seventh war patrol===
She returned to Brisbane to replenish, and on 16 August sailed on her seventh war patrol. She damaged the 6439 ton cargo ship &quot;Yamagiri Maru&quot;, carrying a load of raw materials for the war effort, with two torpedoes on 28 August. Adding to her impressive list of sinkings, she sank the 1334 ton cargo ship &quot;Hakutetsu Maru 13&quot; on 8 September, as well and patrolled off New Georgia during the landings there. She put into Tulagi from 29 September2 October to repair her gyrocompass, then sailed on to Brisbane.

===Eighth war patrol===
&quot;Drum&quot; sailed on 2 November for her eighth war patrol, coordinated with the landings at Cape Torokina. Patrolling between the Carolines and New Ireland, she sank the submarine tender &quot;Hie Maru&quot; (11,621 tons) on 17 November, and on 22 November attacked a convoy of four freighters. The convoy&#x27;s escorts delivered three depth charge attacks. &quot;Drum&quot; was heavily damaged and ordered to Pearl Harbor. She arrived there on 5 December; inspection revealed that the conning tower needed to be replaced, which required that she sail to the West Coast.

===Ninth war patrol===
Returning to Pearl Harbor on 29 March 1944, &quot;Drum&quot; sailed 11 days later on her ninth war patrol, during which she patrolled the waters around Iwo Jima and other islands in the Bonin Islands. No worthy targets were contacted, but a reconnaissance of Chichi Jima gained valuable intelligence for bombardment of the island later by surface ships.

===Tenth and eleventh war patrols===
The submarine refitted at Majuro from 31 May24 June, then sailed on her 10th war patrol to give lifeguard service for raids on Yap and Palau. She sank a 125-ton &quot;sampan&quot; on 29 July, capturing two prisoners whom she brought back to Pearl Harbor on 14 August. For her efforts during the patrol the crew was granted the Submarine Combat Patrol insignia. She sailed for Surigao Strait on 9 September on her 11th war patrol, and after two weeks in the Strait with no contact, she was ordered north to the South China Sea. Here she patrolled during the Leyte landings and the decisive Battle for Leyte Gulf, and on 24 October sank the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shikisan Maru&quot; (4725 tons). On 26 October &quot;Drum&quot;, made contact with a 13 ship convoy (10 merchant with 3 escorts) sinking two passenger-cargo ships, &quot;Taihaku Maru&quot; (6886 tons), &quot;Taisho Maru&quot; (6886 tons), and one transport ship, &quot;Tatsura Maru&quot;, (6420 tons), also damaging another passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Aoki Maru&quot; (3710 tons), bound for the Philippines with Japanese reinforcements. While sailing for Majuro for refit, &quot;Drum&quot; searched east of Luzon Strait for downed aviators.

===Twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth patrols===
&quot;Drum&quot; replenished and made repairs at Majuro from 8 November7 December, then sailed for the Nansei Shoto on her 12th war patrol. Only one contact was made during this patrol, and she returned to Guam on 17 January 1945. During her 13th war patrol, from 11 February2 April, &quot;Drum&quot; played a part in the assaults on both Iwo Jima and Okinawa, providing lifeguard service for air strikes on the Nansei Shoto and the Japanese home islands as bases were neutralized before both invasions. Returning to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Drum&quot; sailed to the U.S. West Coast for another overhaul, and after training at Pearl Harbor, cleared Midway on 9 August for her 14th war patrol. This was cut short by the Japanese surrender on 15 August. She proceeded to Saipan at the end of hostilities, and from there sailed for Pearl Harbor, the Panama Canal Zone, and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

===Post-World War II===
&quot;Drum&quot; was decommissioned on 16 February 1946 and on 18 March 1947, began service at Washington, D.C., to members of the Naval Reserve in the Potomac River Naval Command, which continued through 1967. She was in the inactive Fleet at Norfolk, Virginia from 1967 to 1969.

==Awards==
&quot;Drum&quot; received a total of 12 battle stars for her World War II service. She is credited with sinking 15 ships, a total of 80,580 tons of enemy shipping, eighth highest of all US submarines in total Japanese tonnage sunk.

==Museum ship and landmark==

&quot;Drum&quot; was donated to the USS &quot;Alabama&quot; Battleship Commission on 14 April 1969. She was towed to Battleship Alabama Memorial Park in Mobile, Alabama arriving on 18 May 1969. &quot;Drum&quot; was dedicated and opened to the public on 4 July 1969.

The submarine was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

&quot;Drum&quot; was moored in the waters behind &quot;Alabama&quot;, until she was substantially damaged by the storm surge of Hurricane Georges in 1998. As a result, she is now on display on shore. &quot;Alabama&quot; and &quot;Drum&quot; also sustained damage when Hurricane Katrina came ashore on 29 August 2005. Tours on board &quot;Drum&quot; resumed 9 January 2006. Most funding to maintain the submarine comes from a community of American Submarine Vets.

, the &quot;Drum&quot;&#x27;s restoration has progressed, including the complete rebuilding of part of the bow and stern sections and the installation of new I-beams inside the ballast tanks to support the submarine&#x27;s overall weight.

<text>Anna Moffo (June 27, 1932 – March 9, 2006) was an American opera singer, television personality, and actress. One of the leading lyric-coloratura sopranos of her generation, she possessed a warm and radiant voice of considerable range and agility. Noted for her physical beauty, she was nicknamed &quot;La Bellissima&quot;.

Winning a Fulbright scholarship to study in Italy, Moffo became popular there after performing leading operatic roles on three RAI television productions in 1956. She returned to America for her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago on October 16, 1957. In New York, her Metropolitan Opera debut took place on November 14, 1959. She performed at the Met for over seventeen seasons. Moffo&#x27;s earliest recordings were made for EMI Records; she signed an exclusive contract with RCA Victor in 1960, recording for the company until the late 1970s. In the early 1960s, she hosted her own show on Italian television and appeared in several operatic films along with other non-singing roles.

In the early 1970s Moffo extended her international popularity to Germany through operatic performances, TV appearances, and several films, all while continuing her American operatic performances. Due to an extremely heavy workload, Moffo suffered a serious vocal breakdown from which she never fully recovered. Her final appearance at the Metropolitan Opera was in 1983.

==Early life==
Anna Moffo was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Italian immigrant parents, Nicola Moffo (a shoemaker) and his wife, Regina ( Cinti) Moffo. After graduating from Radnor High School, Anna turned down an offer to go to Hollywood and instead attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Eufemia Giannini-Gregory, sister of soprano Dusolina Giannini. In 1954, on a Fulbright scholarship, she left for Italy to complete her studies at the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome where she was a pupil of Mercedes Llopart and Luigi Ricci. She later studied voice privately in New York City with Beverley Peck Johnson.

==Career==
Moffo made her official operatic debut in 1955 in Spoleto as Norina in &quot;Don Pasquale&quot;. Shortly after, still virtually unknown and little experienced, she was offered the challenging role of Cio-Cio San in an Italian television (RAI) production of &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. The telecast aired on January 24, 1956, and made Moffo an overnight sensation throughout Italy. Offers quickly followed and she appeared in two other television productions that same year, as Nannetta in &quot;Falstaff&quot; and as Amina in &quot;La sonnambula&quot;. She appeared as Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and made her recording debut for EMI as Nannetta (&quot;Falstaff&quot;) under Herbert von Karajan, and as Musetta in &quot;La bohème&quot; with Maria Callas, Giuseppe Di Stefano and Rolando Panerai. The following year (1957) saw her debut at the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg Festival, at La Scala in Milan and the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. Moffo returned to America for her debut there, as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; next to Jussi Björling&#x27;s Rodolfo, at the Lyric Opera of Chicago on October 16, 1957. Moffo had three other roles at the Lyric that season: &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (with Tito Gobbi, Giulietta Simionato and Eleanor Steber) and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;. On at least one occasion her performance of Lucia&#x27;s Mad Scene earned Moffo a 10-minute standing ovation.

Her Metropolitan Opera debut took place on November 14, 1959, as Violetta in &quot;La traviata&quot;, a part that would quickly become her signature role. She performed at The Metropolitan Opera for seventeen seasons in roles such as Lucia, Gilda, Adina, Mimì, Liù, Nedda, Pamina, Marguerite, Juliette, Manon, Mélisande, Périchole, and the four heroines of &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;. Alfred Lunt&#x27;s production of La Traviata as part of the opening of the new Metropolitan Opera House in the Lincoln Center in 1966 was mounted especially for her. In the late 1950s, she recorded Susanna in &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot;, opposite Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Giuseppe Taddei, conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini; and recitals of Mozart arias with EMI. She then became an exclusive RCA Victor artist.

Moffo was also invited to sing at the San Francisco Opera where she made her debut as Amina on October 1, 1960. During that period she also made several appearances on American television, while enjoying a successful international career singing at most major opera houses around the world (Stockholm, Berlin, Monte Carlo, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, etc.). At the Metropolitan Opera in March 1961 with Birgit Nilsson and Franco Corelli she performed in &quot;Turandot&quot; as Liù, conducted by Leopold Stokowski. She made her debut at the Royal Opera House in London, as Gilda, in a Franco Zeffirelli production of &quot;Rigoletto.&quot; Shortly after the Italian tenor Sergio Franchi joined RCA Victor, they recorded a popular album of operetta duets, &quot;The Dream Duet,&quot; which peaked at number ninety seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1963. Later that year Franchi and Moffo collaborated in recording excerpts from &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; with the Vienna State Orchestra and Chorus conducted by Oskar Danon. In 1999 this album was re-mastered and re-issued in High Performance Stereo.

Moffo remained particularly popular in Italy and performed there regularly. She hosted a program on Italian television &quot;The Anna Moffo Show&quot; (two series: the first in 1964; the second in 1967) and was voted one of the ten most beautiful women in Italy. She appeared in film versions of &quot;La traviata&quot; (1967) and &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (1971), both produced (with the Italian TV director Sandro Bolchi) and directed by her first husband Mario Lanfranchi, as well as non-operatic films, including &quot;Menage all&#x27;italiana&quot; (1965), the then controversial &quot;Una storia d&#x27;amore&quot; (1970), &quot;The Adventurers&quot; (1970), &quot;A Girl Called Jules&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Weekend Murders&quot; (1970). In the early 1970s, she began appearing on German television and in operetta films such as &quot;Die Csárdásfürstin&quot; and &quot;Die schöne Galathée&quot;. She also recorded with Eurodisc a lieder album and the title roles in &quot;Carmen&quot; and &quot;Iphigenie in Aulis&quot;, as well as the role of Hänsel in &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;.

Her heavy workload led to physical exhaustion and serious vocal impairment in 1974, from which she never fully recovered. Although she continued to sing in staged opera through 1980, her appearances became more sporadic. Her last performance at the Met was during the 1983 Centennial celebrations, where she sang the Sigmund Romberg duet &quot;Will You Remember?&quot; with Robert Merrill. After retiring from singing Moffo remained active as a board member of the Metropolitan Opera Guild and by hosting several tributes and giving occasional masterclasses.

==Personal life==
Moffo was married twice, first to stage and film director Mario Lanfranchi, on December 8, 1957. The couple divorced in 1972. Her second marriage was to Robert Sarnoff, the chairman of the RCA Corporation, on November 14, 1974. He died on February 22, 1997.

Anna Moffo spent the last years of her life in New York City, where she died in 2006 of a stroke at age 73, following a decade-long battle with breast cancer. She is interred with Sarnoff at Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.

<doc id="677361" wikidata="Q1374280" url="?curid=677361" title="James Beckwourth">
<text>James Pierson Beckwourth (April 26, 1798/1800 – October 20, 1866) was an American fur trapper, rancher, businessman, explorer, author and scout. Known as &quot;Bloody Arm&quot; because of his skill as a fighter, Beckwourth was of multiracial descent, being born into slavery in Frederick County, Virginia. He was eventually emancipated by his enslaver, who was also his father, and apprenticed to a blacksmith so that he could learn a trade.

As a young man, Beckwourth moved to the Western United States, first making connections with fur traders in St. Louis, Missouri. As a mountain man, he lived with the Crow people for several years. He is credited with the discovery of Beckwourth Pass, the lowest pass through the Sierra Nevada, connecting Reno, Nevada, and Portola, California during the California Gold Rush. He improved the Beckwourth Trail, which thousands of settlers followed to central California. Beckwourth narrated his life story to Thomas D. Bonner, who was described as &quot;an itinerant justice of the peace&quot;, but was also a temperance speaker and journalist, who, according to his preface, by chance was present in Beckwourth&#x27;s rustic California hotel when he decided to dictate his memoirs. The book was published in New York City and London in 1856 as &quot;The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth: Mountaineer, Scout and Pioneer, and Chief of the Crow Nation of Indians&quot;. A translation appeared in France in 1860.

The reliability of Beckworth&#x27;s autobiography was called into question from the beginning; an editor of it quoted the observation &quot;that some one said of him that some men are rarely worthy of belief, but that Jim was always Beckwourthy of un-belief.&quot; &quot;I knew Jim intimately and he was the biggest liar that ever lived.&quot; A review when it appeared called it &quot;half fiction&quot;:

Elinor Wilson has defended Beckwourth&#x27;s narration as a valuable source of social history, especially for life among the Crow, although not all its details are reliable or accurate. The civil rights movement of the 1960s celebrated Beckwourth as an early African-American pioneer. He has since been featured as a role model in children&#x27;s literature and textbooks.

==Early life==
James Beckwith was born into slavery in April 26, 1798 (or 1800), in Frederick County, Virginia. Of multiracial descent, his father was Jennings Beckwith, a white planter, and his mother was a Black woman enslaved by Jennings. Jennings was the son of Sir Marmaduke Beckwith, 3rd Baronet, who had immigrated to Virginia and worked as a merchant. Jennings reportedly had thirteen children with James&#x27; mother.

Jennings moved to Missouri around 1809, when James was young, taking James&#x27; mother and all her children with him. Although Beckwith acknowledged and raised his mixed-race children as his own, he legally held them as owner. His father arranged to apprentice him to a blacksmith so that he could learn a good trade. At age 19, he was fired by the artisan after getting into an argument with him. His father freed Beckworth by manumission, by deed of emancipation in court in 1824, 1825, and 1826.

==Career==
===Fur trade and Crow tribe===
As a young man in 1824 Beckwourth joined General William Ashley&#x27;s Rocky Mountain Fur Company. He worked as a wrangler during Ashley&#x27;s expedition to explore the Rocky Mountains. In the following years, Beckwourth became known as a prominent trapper and mountain man. In July 1825, rendezvous, trapper and colleague Caleb Greenwood told the campfire story of Beckwourth&#x27;s being the child of a Crow chief. He claimed Beckwourth had been stolen as a baby by raiding Cheyenne and sold to whites. This lore was widely believed, as Beckwourth had adopted Native American dress and was taken by some people as an Indian.
Later that year, Beckwourth claimed to have been captured by Crow while trapping in the border county between the territories of Crow, Cheyenne, and Blackfoot. According to his account, he was mistaken for the lost son of a Crow chief, so they admitted him to the nation. Independent accounts suggest his stay with the Crow was planned by the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to advance its trade with the tribe. Beckwourth married the daughter of a chief. (Marriages between Native Americans and fur trappers and traders were common for the valuable alliances they provided both parties.)

For the next eight to nine years, Beckwourth lived with a Crow band, who named him &quot;Bull&#x27;s Robe.&quot; He rose in their society from warrior to chief (a respected man) and leader of the &quot;Dog Clan&quot;. According to his book, he eventually ascended to the highest-ranking war chieftaincy of the Crow tribe. He still trapped but did not sell his or Crow furs to his former partners of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. Instead, he sold to John Jacob Astor&#x27;s competing American Fur Company. Beckwourth participated in raids by the Crow on neighboring nations and the occasional white party. Sometimes such raids escalated to warfare, most often against bands of their traditional Blackfoot enemy.

In 1837, when the American Fur Company did not renew his contract, Beckwourth returned to St. Louis. He volunteered with the United States Army to fight in the Second Seminole War in Florida. In his book, he claims to have been a soldier and courier. According to historical records, he was a civilian wagon master in the baggage division.
During one trade exchange Beckwourth may have helped to spread smallpox to an Indian tribe. When Little Robe had complained to fur trapper Jim Bridger that &quot;white men&quot; were responsible for destroying his people, Bridger replied that Whites didn&#x27;t do that, &quot;he told Little Robe how Jim Beckwourth a Mulatto...had done this evil thing,&quot; by trading infected blankets with the Indians, and pointing out that &quot;Beckwourth...was a Negro, and therefore not a white man.&quot;
From 1838 to 1840, Beckwourth was an Indian trader to the Cheyenne, on the Arkansas River, working out of Fort Vasquez, Colorado, near Platteville. In 1840, he moved to Bent, St. Vrain &amp; Company. Later that same year, Beckwourth became an independent trader. In 1842, Beckwourth moved to new settlement at Pueblo, Colorado with a wife (or consort), Maria Luisa Sandoval and a child Matilda. In 1843, he departed for California and when he returned to Pueblo in 1846 Luisa was married (in the informal style of the mountains) to John Brown.

In 1844, Beckwourth traded on the Old Spanish Trail between the Arkansas River and California, then controlled by Mexico. When the Mexican–American War began in 1846, Beckwourth returned to the United States. He brought along nearly 1,800 stolen Mexican horses as spoils of war. In the war, he served as a courier with the U.S. Army and helped suppress the Taos Revolt. His former employer, Charles Bent, then interim governor of New Mexico, was slain in that revolt.

===Business===
By 1848 and the start of the Gold Rush, Beckwourth went to California. He first opened a store at Sonoma. He soon sold and went to Sacramento, then a boomtown close to the mines, to live as a professional card player.

In 1850, Beckwourth was credited with discovering what came to be called Beckwourth Pass, a low-elevation pass through the Sierra Nevada mountain chain. In 1851, he improved what became the Beckwourth Trail, originally a Native American path through the mountains. It began near Pyramid Lake and the Truckee Meadows east of the mountains, climbed to the pass named for him, and went along a ridge, between two forks of Feather River, before passing down through the gold fields of northern California, and on to Marysville. The trail spared the settlers and gold seekers about and several steep grades and dangerous passes, such as Donner Pass.

By his account, the business communities of the gold towns in California were supposed to fund the making of the trail. However, when Beckwourth tried to collect his payment in 1851 after leading a party, Marysville suffered from two huge fires and town leaders were unable to pay. (In 1996, in recognition of his contribution to the city&#x27;s development and of the outstanding debt to him, the City of Marysville officially renamed the town&#x27;s largest park as Beckwourth Riverfront Park.)

Beckwourth began ranching in the Sierra. His ranch, trading post, and hotel, in today&#x27;s Sierra Valley, were the starting of the settlement of Beckwourth, California. In the winter of 1854/55, the itinerant judge Thomas D. Bonner stayed in the hotel, and on winter nights Beckwourth told him his life story. Bonner wrote it down, edited the material the following year, and offered the book to Harper &amp; Brothers in New York. &quot;The Life and Adventures of James P. Beckwourth&quot; was published in 1856. According to the contract, Beckwourth was entitled to one-half of the proceeds, but he never received any income from Bonner. The book provides historical information on how U.S. government officials used alcohol; how occupations affect those who work in the field; the historical relationship among diseases, wildlife, and the environment; as well as reports dealing with massacres and war.

===Military service===

In 1859, Beckwourth returned to Missouri briefly but settled later that year in Denver, Colorado Territory. Working as a storekeeper in the employ of Louis Vasquez, Beckwourth was appointed as an Indian agent by the government. In 1864, Beckwourth was hired as a scout by United States Army officer John Chivington, who commanded the 3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment. The regiment subsequently served in a campaign against the Cheyenne and Apache as part of the Colorado War. Chivington&#x27;s men perpetrated the Sand Creek massacre on November 29, 1864, in which the U.S. Army slaughtered an estimated 70-163 Cheyenne people, who had camped in an area suggested by the previous commander of Fort Lyon as a safe place and were flying an American flag to show their peaceful intentions. Outraged by his involvement in the massacre, the Cheyenne banned Beckwourth from trading with them. Well into his sixties by then, Beckwourth returned to trapping. In 1866, during Red Cloud&#x27;s War, the United States Army again employed him as a scout at Fort Laramie and Fort Phil Kearny.

==Death==
While guiding a military column to a Crow band in Montana, Beckwourth complained of severe headaches and suffered nosebleeds, most probably the result of a severe case of hypertension, but Jim Bridger heard that the Crows had poisoned him. Beckwourth returned to the Crow village, where he died in 1866. William Byers, a personal friend and the founder of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;, claimed the Crow had poisoned Beckwourth. He said the tribe felt they could no longer trust him. Beckwourth was buried at the lodge of Iron Bull near Fort Smith and Clarks Fork in Crow Territory. Lt. Templeton, stationed at Fort C.F. Smith in the &quot;heart of the Crow Hunting Grounds&quot;, chronicled the end of Beckwourth&#x27;s life in his diary. He wrote &quot;On his arrival at the village he and Thompson were taken into the lodge of the Iron Bull and were his guest while he remained. There Beckwourth died and was buried by his host.&quot;

*Matt Braun, &quot;Bloody Hand&quot;, New York: St Martin&#x27;s Press, 1996, . (novel about Beckwourth&#x27;s life with the Crow)
*In the 2021 film &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; directed by Jeymes Samuel, his role was played by actor RJ Cyler.

==Legacy==
* Beckwourth Pass, named in honor of Beckwourth, is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Plumas County, California. This pass and route was used by the Western Pacific Railroad to cross the Sierra along their Feather River route. The pass is located east of Portola, California. State Route 70 crosses the Sierra at this pass at an elevation of 1,591 m (5,221 ft); it is the lowest pass crossing the Sierras in California. 
* In 1994, the U.S. Postal Service issued a 29-cent commemorative postage stamp honoring Beckwourth as part of the set &quot;Legends of the West&quot;.
* In 1996, the city of Marysville, California renamed its largest park as Beckwourth Riverfront Park to commemorate his contributions to development of the city. For a few years, the &quot;Beckwourth Frontier Days&quot; were celebrated annually in October and were the only living history festival in northern California.
* What is now West 5th Ave. in Denver, Colorado, was named Beckwourth Street (sometimes Beckwith) after James Beckwourth.
* In 2011 a memorial commemorating Beckwourth&#x27;s role in the founding of Pueblo, Colorado, was erected in that city.

<text>The River Cover is a river in the Yorkshire Dales in North Yorkshire, England. The Yorkshire Dales Rivers Trust has a remit to conserve the ecological condition of the River Cover. The river forms a limestone dale with ancient woodlands.

==Course==

The source of the river lies in the shake holes that are found between Buckden Pike and Great Whernside that feed many small gills, such as East Stone Gill, West Stone Gill and Downs Gill. Where these conjoined flows meet Hazel Bank Gill is where the river becomes known as the River Cover. It flows in a north-east direction past Woodale, Braidley and Horsehouse. It turns to the north north-east towards Gammersgill before returning north-east between West Scrafton and Carlton, North Yorkshire. Immediately east of Agglethorpe, the river turns east until it joins the River Ure south-east of Middleham.

The river flows north eastwards for and drains an area covering over .

==Ecology==

The river is home for brown trout and grayling.

==Geology==

The river runs along a U-shaped glacial valley over Great Scar limestone with Yoredale rock forming the valley sides. It is a gently meandering river with a characteristic stony channel and beaches leading to wooded low banks. The wooded areas extend up into the many gills that join the river.

<text>Karl Gordon Henize (; October 17, 1926 – October 5, 1993) was an American astronomer, space scientist, NASA astronaut, and professor at Northwestern University. He was stationed at several observatories around the world, including McCormick Observatory, Lamont–Hussey Observatory (South Africa), Mount Wilson Observatory, Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Mount Stromlo Observatory (Australia). He was a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 15 and Skylab 2, 3, and 4. As a mission specialist on the Spacelab-2 mission (STS-51-F), he flew on Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; in July/August 1985. He was awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1974.

He died in 1993, during a Mount Everest expedition while testing equipment for NASA.

==Early life and education==
Karl Henize was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 17, 1926. He grew up on a small dairy farm outside Cincinnati, and his boyhood heroes were Buck Rogers and Sir Edmund Hillary, the first man to reach the summit of Mount Everest. Henize was fascinated with space at a young age. Since space travel had not happened yet during his childhood, he became interested in astronomy. Henize built his own telescopes and read every book on astronomy in his school&#x27;s library. He joined the Boy Scouts, and his only merit badge was in astronomy.

His hobbies included home computers, stamp collecting, mathematics, and astronomy, and he also enjoyed racquetball, baseball, skin diving, and mountain climbing.

Henize attended elementary school in Plainville and Mariemont, Ohio. The school was small, three or four rooms, and did not contain a library. He also attended high school in Mariemont, where he played baseball and was on the tumbling team. Due to the war, Karl elected to not finish high school, instead entering the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which first took him to Denison University in Granville, Ohio, and then to the University of Virginia. World War II ended before he received his Naval Commission, so he became a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander and retained a draft status of A1 until being required to give that up when he became an astronaut in 1967. While at the University of Virginia, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1947, and a Master of Arts degree in astronomy in 1948, while also carrying out research at McCormick Observatory. He was awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in astronomy in 1954 by the University of Michigan.

Henize married Caroline in Ann Arbor, and they had four children: Kurt, Marcia, Skye, and Vance.

==Experience==

Henize was an observer for the University of Michigan Observatory from 1948 to 1951, stationed at the Lamont–Hussey Observatory in Bloemfontein, Union of South Africa. While there, he conducted an objective-prism spectroscopic survey of the southern sky for stars and nebulae showing emission lines of hydrogen.

In 1954 he became a Carnegie post-doctoral fellow at the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California, and conducted spectroscopic and photometric studies of emission-line stars and nebulae. From 1956 to 1959, he served as a senior astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. He was in charge of photographic satellite tracking stations for the satellite tracking program and responsible for the establishment and operation of a global network of 12 stations for photographic tracking of artificial Earth satellites.

Henize was appointed associate professor in Northwestern University&#x27;s Department of Astronomy in 1959 and was awarded a professorship in 1964. In addition to teaching, he conducted research on planetary nebulae, peculiar emission-line stars, S-type stars, and T-associations. During 1961 and 1962, he was a guest observer at Mount Stromlo Observatory in Canberra, Australia, where he used instruments ranging from the Uppsala 20/26-inch schmidt to the 74-inch parabolic reflector.
Henize also engaged in studies of ultraviolet optical systems and astronomical programs suited to the crewed space flight program. He became principal investigator of experiment S-013 which obtained ultraviolet stellar spectra during the Gemini 10, 11, and 12 flights. He also became principal investigator of experiment S-019 in which a 6-inch aperture objective-prism spectrograph was used on Skylab to obtain ultraviolet spectra of faint stars.

From 1974 to 1978 Henize chaired the NASA Facility Definition Team for STARLAB, a proposed 1-meter UV telescope for Spacelab. From 1978 to 1980 he chaired the NASA Working Group for the Spacelab Wide-Angle Telescope. Since 1979 he had been the chairman of the International Astronomical Union Working Group for Space Schmidt Surveys and was one of the leaders in proposing the use of a 1-meter (3 ft) all-reflecting Schmidt telescope to carry out a deep full-sky survey in far-ultraviolet wavelengths.

He authored or co-authored 70 scientific publications dealing with astronomy research.

==NASA experience==

Henize applied for the first scientist-astronaut group, but was denied because the age limit was 35 and he was 37. In 1967, NASA abolished the age limit, and Henize was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in August. Astronauts that did not already know how to fly had to complete a 53-week jet pilot training program at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. They also completed initial education there. He was a member of the astronaut support crew and CAPCOM for the Apollo 15 mission. The entire support crew consisted of scientist-astronauts, as the prime crew of the mission thought they would need more help with the science aspects of the mission rather than the piloting. He was also a member of the astronaut support crew for the Skylab 2, 3, and 4 missions. He was mission specialist for the ASSESS-2 spacelab simulation mission in 1977. He logged 2,300 hours flying time in jet aircraft.
Henize was a mission specialist on the Spacelab-2 mission (STS-51-F) which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on July 29, 1985. He was accompanied by Col. Gordon Fullerton (spacecraft commander), Col. Roy D. Bridges (pilot), fellow mission specialists Dr. Anthony W. England and Dr. F. Story Musgrave, as well as two payload specialists, Dr. Loren Acton and Dr. John-David Bartoe.

This mission was the first pallet-only Spacelab mission and the first mission to operate the Spacelab Instrument Pointing System (IPS). It carried 13 major experiments, of which seven were in the field of astronomy and solar physics, three were for studies of the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, two were life science experiments, and one studied the properties of superfluid helium. Henize&#x27;s responsibilities included testing and operating the IPS, operating the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), maintaining the Spacelab systems, and operating several of the experiments.

After 126 orbits of the Earth, STS 51-F &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on August 6, 1985. With the completion of this flight Henize logged 190 hours in space.

In 1986, he retired as an astronaut and accepted a position as senior scientist in the Space Sciences Branch. He studied space debris and hazards to the space station.

In the 1998 miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot;, Henize was played by Marc Macaulay.

==Death==

Henize, on leave from NASA at the time, went on a hiking expedition to Mount Everest with British research group High Adventure BVI. Henize intended to test the Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter (TEPC) at different altitudes: , , and . The TEPC would reveal how people&#x27;s bodies would be affected, including the way bodily tissues behaved, when struck by radiation, which was important for the planning of long duration space missions. The data would be shared with NASA and BVI.

Henize acclimatized at Kathmandu, Nepal, followed by acclimatization at expedition base camp in China. Henize, with three members of High Adventure BVI, began the hike on October 4, 1993. Henize reported breathing problems on their way to advanced base camp; they were at . Treatments with oxygen failed, and they returned to base camp. On October 5, Henize died in his sleep. The cause of death was determined to be high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Henize, aged 66, was buried near the Changtse Glacier. He was survived by his wife, Caroline, and four children.

==Organizations==
Henize was a member of the American Astronomical Society; the Royal Astronomical Society; the Astronomical Society of the Pacific; the International Astronomical Union; and Phi Beta Kappa.

==Special honors==
He was presented the Robert Gordon Memorial Award for 1968, and was a recipient of NASA Group Achievement Awards in 1971, 1974, 1975, 1978. He was also awarded the NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal in 1974.

==Writings==

In 1956, Henize published the &quot;Catalogues of Hα-Emission Stars and Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds&quot;. The paper references many objects which bear his name, such as the Superbubble Henize 70 and the planetary nebula Henize 3–401. He discovered over 2,000 stars. In total, he published 75 papers.

<text>William S. Laughlin (August 26, 1919 – April 6, 2001) was an American anthropologist who carried on research and wrote about aboriginal peoples in the Aleutians and Greenland.

William Sceva Laughlin was born in Canton, Missouri in 1919. He grew up in Salem, Oregon, where his father was a professor at Willamette University. His education included a bachelor&#x27;s (Willamette University, 1941) and master&#x27;s (Haverford College, 1942) degree in sociology, and master&#x27;s (1948) and Ph.D. (1949) degrees in anthropology from Harvard University. His academic career in anthropology included professorships at the University of Oregon (1949-1955), the University of Wisconsin (1955-1969), and the University of Connecticut (1969-1999). His primary field of specialization was physical anthropology, including Aleutian-Siberian studies, human biology, population history and human evolution. Laughlin first came to Alaska in 1938 as a member of the Smithsonian Expedition to the Aleutian Islands, directed by Dr. Aleš Hrdlička. In 1948, he was the field director for the Peabody Museum&#x27;s Expedition to the Aleutians. Over the years, he made over twenty trips to the Aleutians to study its peoples. His research there culminated in the publication in 1980 of his book, Aleuts: Survivors of the Bering Land Bridge. He also co-edited the book, The First Americans: Origins, Affinities and Adaptations, with Connecticut colleague, Albert B. Harper. Laughlin was a member or fellow of several professional societies, edited the American Journal for Physical Anthropology (1958-1963), and served on several scientific committees, including the U. S. National Committee for the International Biological Program, the Committee to Evaluate National Science Foundation Programs, and the Programs Advisory Committee of the National Institutes for Dental Research. William S. Laughlin died in Portland, Oregon, in 2001.

<text>Robert Byron (26 February 1905 – 24 February 1941) was an English travel writer, best known for his travelogue &quot;The Road to Oxiana&quot;. He was also an art critic and historian.

==Biography==
Robert Byron was born in Wembley, London on 26 February 1905, the only son of three children born to Eric Byron, a civil engineer, and his wife Margaret, daughter of William Robinson, of Southall Manor, Middlesex. He was educated at Eton College and Merton College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1925 in Modern History. At Oxford he took part in the Hypocrites&#x27; Club.

Byron travelled in 1925 across Europe in a car to Greece, with Alfred Duggan and Gavin Henderson. It led to his first book, and a second was commissioned for Duckworth by Thomas Balston, to be on Mount Athos. He later visited India, the Soviet Union, and Tibet.

It was in Persia and Afghanistan that Byron found the subject to match his style of travel writing. He completed his account of &quot;The Road to Oxiana&quot; in Beijing, his temporary home. His innovation, that set him apart from his major travel writing rival Peter Fleming and others, was to disregard the conventional continuous narrative.

An appreciation of architecture is a strong element in Byron&#x27;s writings. He was a forceful advocate for the preservation of historic buildings and a founder member of the Georgian Group. A philhellene, he also pioneered, in the English-speaking world, a renewal of interest in Byzantine history. Byron has been described as &quot;one of the first and most brilliant of twentieth-century philhellenes&quot;. Photographs of Iranian architecture by Byron, taken while he was writing &quot;The Road to Oxiana&quot; between 1933 and 1934 are held in the Conway Library of Art and Architecture at The Courtauld Institute of Art in London.

He attended the last Nuremberg Rally, in 1938, with Nazi sympathiser Unity Mitford. Byron knew her through his friendship with her sister Nancy Mitford, but he was an outspoken opponent of the Nazis. Nancy Mitford hoped at one stage that Byron would propose marriage to her, and was later astonished as well as shocked to discover his homosexual tastes, complaining: &quot;This wretched paederasty falsifies all feelings and yet one is supposed to revere it.&quot; According to Paul Fussell in his introduction to the Oxford paperback edition of &quot;The Road to Oxiana&quot; (1982) Byron was a fervent and vocal critic of Hitler, &quot;object[ing] in the most violent terms to the Nazification of Europe and abusing those in England who imagined that some sort of compromise with this new wickedness was possible&quot;.

Byron&#x27;s great, though unreciprocated, passion was for Desmond Parsons, younger brother of the 6th Earl of Rosse, who was regarded as one of the most charismatic men of his generation. They lived together in Peking, in 1935, where Parsons developed Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, of which he died in Zurich, in 1937, at 26 years old. Byron was left devastated.

==Death, reputation and legacy==

Byron died aged 35 in 1941, during World War II, when the ship on which he was travelling was torpedoed en route to West Africa. Byron was destined for Egypt and would likely have transshipped on arrival and continued his journey via the Cape. The SS &quot;Jonathan Holt&quot; was torpedoed by U-97, a Type VIIC submarine, in the North Atlantic off Cape Wrath. His body was never found.

An acquaintance from early days, Evelyn Waugh noted Byron&#x27;s gumption. In 1929 he wrote to Henry Yorke &quot;I hear Robert has beaten us all by going to India in an aeroplane which is the sort of success which I call tangible.&quot; But writing in 1948, Waugh said of Byron in a letter to Harold Acton: &quot;It is not yet the time to say so but I greatly disliked Robert in his last years &amp; think he was a dangerous lunatic better off dead.&quot; The passionately anti-communist Waugh believed that during the 1930s Byron had become pro-Soviet, though Byron&#x27;s – and Waugh&#x27;s – biographer Christopher Sykes firmly denied any such sympathy on Byron&#x27;s part.

Prince Charles read Byron&#x27;s prose &quot;All These I Learnt&quot; on BBC Radio 4 on National Poetry Day, 5 October 2006.

In February 2012, his book &quot;Europe in the Looking Glass&quot; was serialised by BBC&#x27;s Radio 4 Book of the Week. The program included detailed passages of Germany and an eyewitness report of the 1922 Greek refugee exodus and massacres following the Great Fire of Smyrna.

<doc id="677389" wikidata="Q1254108" url="?curid=677389" title="Dr. T &amp; the Women">
<text>Dr. T &amp; The Women is a 2000 American romantic comedy film directed by Robert Altman, featuring an ensemble cast including Richard Gere as wealthy gynecologist Dr. Sullivan Travis (&quot;Dr. T&quot;) and Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett, Laura Dern, Shelley Long, Tara Reid, Kate Hudson, and Liv Tyler as the various women that he encounters in his everyday life. The movie was primarily filmed in Dallas, Texas, and was released in US theaters on October 13, 2000. The film&#x27;s music was composed by American composer and alternative country singer Lyle Lovett, who released an album of his score in September 2000.

==Plot==
Dr. Sullivan &#x27;Sully&#x27; Travis (aka &quot;Dr. T.&quot;), a wealthy Dallas gynecologist for some of the wealthiest ladies in Texas, finds his life beginning to fall apart starting when his wife, Kate, suffers from &quot;Hestia Complex&quot;, a rare type of stigmatization syndrome of wealthy women; after she disrobes in a shopping mall fountain while shopping for their daughter&#x27;s wedding registry at Tiffany&#x27;s, she is committed to the state mental hospital. When Dr. T visits Kate, she rebuffs his kisses as improper and he sees her old psyche cannot be returned to now by his affection. Dr. T&#x27;s daughter, Dee Dee, a student at Southern Methodist University and alternate for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, is planning to go through with her approaching wedding despite the secret that she is romantically involved with Marilyn, her former college friend in Houston and the maid of honor. Dr. T&#x27;s other daughter, Connie, is a conspiracy theorist and eventually reveals to her father that Dee Dee and Marilyn are lovers.

While Marilyn is on his examining table for the first time, she surmises her condition is caused by the stress of being the maid of honor for her friend Dee Dee. Dr. T realizes she is Dee Dee&#x27;s lover and becomes embarrassed mid-examination, asking the nurse to finish.

Dr. T&#x27;s loyal secretary Carolyn has romantic feelings for him, which are not mutual: in a farcical scene at the workday end, she locks the office door and gives him a shoulder massage from behind his chair, secretly disrobing while emphasizing his need for a loving wife. Refreshed but unaware of her intentions, he goes to the coat closet, turns, and finds she has vanished. From under the desk, she says he never empties his trash baskets. Approaching the desk he glimpses her state of undress and quickly leaves.

Meanwhile, Dr. T&#x27;s alcoholic sister-in-law, Peggy, unintentionally meddles in every situation she stumbles into. She is currently divorced and has moved into his house with her three daughters.

At his golf club, Bree, a golf pro, gets accidentally soaked by the automatic sprinklers. He offers a towel and his dry golf cart and they decide to play the round together. Accepting his offer for dinner, she says she knows a better place than his suggested restaurant, next they&#x27;re taking grocery bags into her condo. She moves quickly and gracefully turning on the stereo music by Lyle Lovett, the grill on the balcony, putting steak on, going upstairs, into one room, then walking nude across the balcony to the shower. After dinner, she takes a bottle of wine upstairs, briefly hesitating he follows her and they become lovers. She provides friendship and comfort in his difficult office and personal life.

As Dee Dee&#x27;s wedding begins the skies are darkening and thunder increasing. As the procession is blown by increasing wind, Dee Dee bypasses her groom, embraces and kisses Marilyn and the skies open up sending all the guests for shelter. Inspired, Dr. T drives his open-top convertible to Bree&#x27;s house where he asks her to marry and run away with him. He offers to fulfill her every need and she asks why she would want that (this is what caused Kate&#x27;s syndrome according to her psychologist). She says she has made other plans. Dr. T. asks if she is with Harlan, one of his golfing/hunting buddies, and she replies: “I’m not with anybody.” Distraught, Dr. T. drives off into the storm and into a tornado as it crosses his path and is lifted into the air, tumbling in debris. The scene fades to the morning after. The camera view pans to reveal distant mountains surrounding a vast desert flat land. His car is found by three Mexican girls. A little girl in a white dress with a veil sees the doctor&#x27;s badge on the front grill of the car. They find &amp; lead him, still dazed, to a circle of seven tiny houses where a girl is in labor. Galvanized by the sight, he immediately washes his hands, drops his wedding ring into the basin, takes charge, and delivers the baby, holding it and rejoicing “It’s a boy!”

==Release==
&quot;Dr. T &amp; The Women&quot; was released in US cinemas on October 13, 2000 by Artisan Entertainment, and earned $5,012,867 in its opening weekend on 1,489 screens, ranking #7 in the weekend of October 13, 2000 ultimately grossing $13,113,041 in the United States. It was released in the United Kingdom on July 6, 2001, by Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International, grossing $9,731,250 in international profits.

==Reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 57% approval rating, based on 108 reviews with an average rating of 5.71/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;In terms of quality, &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; is one of Altman&#x27;s good-but-not-great films. In typical Altman style, it features some great ensemble acting, including a wonderful performance by Richard Gere.&quot; Metacritic gave the film an average score of 64/100, based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;. CinemaScore audience polling gave the film an &quot;F.&quot; Coincidentally, it was released the same day as &quot;Lost Souls&quot;, which also received an &quot;F.&quot;

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, stating &quot;When you hear that Dr. T is a gynecologist played by Richard Gere, you assume he is a love machine mowing down his patients. Nothing could be further from the truth&quot;.

A. O. Scott wrote in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Dr. T and the Women&#x27; uses its affluent milieu to good comic effect, but it&#x27;s mellower and more forgiving than [Altman&#x27;s earlier works &quot;The Player, Tanner &#x27;88,&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot;], and less interested in social criticism than in the celebration of human foible. In spite of Sully&#x27;s troubles, the emotional stakes never seem very high. Everyone seems to be having too much fun to be suffering terribly much.&quot;

In a moderately favorable review for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy wrote, &quot;Although marked by a continually enjoyable accretion of detail and vital work by the thesps, storytelling admittedly leans to the slight and leisurely through the first hour or so, until a prolonged sequence devoted to Dr. T’s day from hell.&quot;

<text>23, original German title: 23 – Nichts ist so wie es scheint (&quot;Nothing is what it seems&quot;) is a 1998 German drama thriller film about young hacker Karl Koch, who died on 23 May 1989, a presumed suicide. It was directed by Hans-Christian Schmid, who also participated in screenwriting. The title derives from the protagonist&#x27;s obsession with the number 23, a phenomenon often described as apophenia. Although the film was well received by critics and audiences, its accuracy has been vocally disputed by several witnesses to the real-life events on which it was based. Schmid subsequently co-authored a book that tells the story of the making of &quot;23&quot; and also details the differences between the movie and the actual main events.

==Plot==
In 1980s Germany at the height of the Cold War, 19-year-old Karl Koch finds the world around him threatening and chaotic. Inspired by the fictitious character Hagbard Celine (from Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;), he starts investigating the backgrounds of political and economic power and discovers signs that make him believe in a worldwide conspiracy.

At a meeting of the Chaos Computer Club, Karl gets to know the student David. David and Karl are able to hack into the global data network — still in its early stages — and their belief in social justice propels them into espionage for the KGB. Driven by contacts with a drug dealer—and by increasing KGB pressure to hack into foreign systems—Karl spirals into a cocaine dependency and grows increasingly alienated from David.

In a drug-addled state, Karl begins to sit in front of his computer for days at a time. Perpetually sleepless, he also grows increasingly delusional. When David publicly reveals the espionage activity in which the two men have been engaged, Karl is left alone to face the consequences. Collapse soon follows. Karl is taken to a hospital to deal with his drug addiction and mysteriously dies after his supposed hacking of Chernobyl.

<doc id="677408" wikidata="Q4788635" url="?curid=677408" title="Area codes 613, 343, and 753">
<text>Area codes 613, 343, and 753 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for Ottawa and surrounding Eastern Ontario, Canada. Area code 613 is one of the 86 original North American area codes assigned in October 1947. Area code 343 was assigned to the numbering plan area in an overlay plan activated on May 17, 2010. Area code 753 was assigned as an additional overlay code for the numbering plan area, activated on March 26, 2022.

== History ==
Area code 613 was originally assigned to a numbering plan area that included all of Ontario with the exception of the Golden Horseshoe, which was assigned the area code 416. The numbering plan area has been split twice. In 1953, the southwestern Ontario portion of 613 was combined with the western portion of 416 to become numbering plan area 519. In 1957, the vast northwestern portion of 613 was combined with the northern portion of 519 to receive area code 705. Since 1957, 613 covers only eastern Ontario, an area extending from Brighton and Deep River eastward to Saint Regis, Quebec.

Ottawa and its twin city in Quebec, Gatineau, fall on the boundary between 613 and Quebec&#x27;s area code 819. However, Ottawa shares a local calling area with the former city of Hull, Quebec (now part of the city of Gatineau). As a result, for 46 years, a call could be completed between Ottawa and Hull with only seven digits. 

While there are fewer than two million people in the geographic area served by 613, the bulk of that population lives in the Ottawa area. To preserve seven-digit dialling between Ottawa and Hull, an exchange code protection scheme was implemented so that the same seven-digit local number could not be assigned on both sides of the National Capital Region. Technically, it was only necessary that no two prefixes within the same local calling area be duplicates, but the code protection as implemented reserved the numbers across both area codes. This meant that if an 819-number was being used in Hull, the corresponding 613-number could not be used anywhere in eastern Ontario, even in areas a safe distance from the National Capital Region such as Brighton. Similarly, if a 613-number was being used in Ottawa–Carleton, the corresponding 819-number could not be used anywhere in western Quebec. Federal government offices in Hull duplicated their entire allocation of multiple exchanges worth of numbers available in 613 as part of a &quot;dual dialability&quot; scheme.

By the turn of the century, both 613 and 819 were close to exhaustion due to Canada&#x27;s inefficient number allocation system. Every competitive local exchange carrier received blocks of 10,000 numbers (corresponding to a single prefix) in every rate centre in which it planned to offer local service, no matter how small. A tiny unincorporated village (like Odessa, Ontario, with no telephone central office but still listed as a rate centre) usually received multiple 10,000-number blocks. Once a number is assigned to a rate centre and CLEC, it is unavailable for use elsewhere, even in cases when a rate centre has more numbers than it needs. Larger municipalities have multiple rate centres and multiple competing carriers in each. For instance, even though Ottawa has been a single municipality since merging with the Regional Municipality of Ottawa–Carleton in 2001, it still has 11 rate centres (plus portions of other rate centres primarily located beyond the city limits) – most with very similar local calling areas – which have never been amalgamated. The &quot;Ottawa–Hull&quot; exchange only covers the area that was the city of Ottawa prior to the 2001 amalgamation, plus the former suburbs of Nepean (central part) and Vanier and small sections of other urban communities.

Since Canada does not use number pooling as a relief measure, many telephone numbers of the area code remained unused. The proliferation of cell phones and pagers, particularly in the larger cities in the 613 area (Ottawa, Kingston, Belleville, etc.) only magnified the problem. By 2006, the only remaining unassigned exchange prefixes in the entire 819 region were numbers which could not be assigned to the Quebec side of the Ottawa–Hull area without breaking seven-digit dialling between Hull and Ottawa.

Ten-digit dialling in 613 and 819 became mandatory on October 21, 2006. Intraprovincial calls from rate centres with no local calling beyond a small fragment of their own area code were returning intercept messages if dialled as seven digits. Exchange protection in the National Capital Region was ended, except for the &quot;dual dialability&quot; scheme for government numbers on both sides of the river. This situation could have been avoided had some 1-613 versions of seven-digit Ottawa-Hull numbers been assigned to areas a safe distance from the National Capital Region years earlier.

Within two years, it became apparent that a new area code was necessary due to the continued number allocation problem – an issue exacerbated by the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. A geographic split was quickly ruled out. Local telephone companies did not want the expense and burden of changing existing customers&#x27; numbers, which would have required &quot;en masse&quot; reprogramming of cell phones. As a result, overlay area codes were proposed for both 613 and 819.

Area code 343, an overlay proposed in 2007, and approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission on September 10, 2008, was activated for the region on May 17, 2010, several years earlier than originally anticipated.

On 10 November 2021, the Canadian Numbering Administrator approved an additional overlay code for the numbering plan area 613/343. Area code 753 was assigned for activation on March 26, 2022.

==Carriers==
The main incumbent local exchange carrier in area code 613 is Bell Canada, but there are some five independent companies serving rural exchanges: the Lansdowne Rural Telephone Company, serving Lansdowne; the North Frontenac Telephone Company, serving Sharbot Lake and Parham; the North Renfrew Telephone Company, serving Beachburg, Westmeath, and the area outside Pembroke; the Roxborough Telephone Company, serving Moose Creek; and the Westport Telephone Company, serving Westport.

Also served by area code 613 and Bell Canada is Saint-Régis, Quebec. The exchange covers the Mohawk nation territory of Akwesasne, which straddles the Ontario–Québec–New York border. Calls from Saint-Régis to Fort Covington, New York, are local although they cross an international border.

In the west, Rapides-des-Joachims, Quebec, shares an exchange with the adjacent Rolphton, Ontario.

The college is named after Abraham Baldwin, a signer of the United States Constitution from Georgia and the first president of the University of Georgia.

ABAC was established in 1908 as the Second District A&amp;M School. The name was changed to the South Georgia A&amp;M College in 1924, and to the Georgia State College for Men in 1929. It became Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in 1933 when ABAC became a part of the newly formed University System of Georgia. At that time, ABAC&#x27;s mission was devoted to associate level studies in agriculture, home economics, and related fields. Today, ABAC offers a variety of bachelor&#x27;s degree programs as well as associate degrees.

==Campus==
The ABAC campus is used as an open-air classroom for students in the School of Agriculture and Natural Resources due to the large number of trees, plants, shrubs, and fields on campus. ABAC faculty, staff, students and visitors also enjoy the well-manicured grounds of the college. A renovation project was recently completed for the original three buildings on campus, Tift, Lewis, and Herring Halls. New landscaping and a new front lawn for ABAC were also a part of the renovation process. ABAC has a lab science building that was opened in 2016. ABAC also has an instructional site in Bainbridge.

==Academics==

The Forestry track of the Natural Resources Management program is accredited by the Society of American Foresters. Nursing is the largest single major. This associate degree program prepares students to be certified as a Registered Nurse (R.N.).

Learning laboratories such as the J.G. Woodroof Farm and the Forest Lakes Golf Club enhance the academic curriculum. ABAC&#x27;s 516-acre campus also includes the Georgia Museum of Agriculture and Historic Village, one mile south of the main campus. Key components of the museum include an 1890s village, a blacksmith shop, a grist mill, a cotton gin, a print shop, a saw mill, and a steam locomotive.

==Student life==

There are numerous student organizations on the ABAC campus. Students have the opportunity to get involved with organizations ranging from the Student Government Association to the Forestry-Wildlife Club.

===Campus media===
&quot;The Stallion&quot; is the premier student newspaper in both the state and the southeast region. Staff of the literary magazine, &quot;Pegasus&quot;, and creative writing faculty sponsor numerous poetry readings each year. Other events include a Writer&#x27;s Harvest and contributions to the George Scott Day festival.

ABAC also has its own radio station, WPLH 103.1.

===Athletics===
Intercollegiate sports teams include basketball, baseball, golf, and tennis for men, and basketball, softball, tennis, and soccer for women. ABAC has five national championships, three in softball and two in men&#x27;s tennis.

<doc id="677430" wikidata="Q6524265" url="?curid=677430" title="Leo T. McCarthy">
<text>Leo Tarcissus McCarthy (August 15, 1930 – February 5, 2007) was an American politician and businessman. He served as the 43rd lieutenant governor of California from 1983 to 1995.

==Early life and education==
McCarthy, whose parents were both natives of Tralee, Ireland, was himself born in Auckland, New Zealand, on August 15, 1930 but emigrated to the United States with his parents Daniel and Nora McCarthy, and siblings when he was three years old. The McCarthy family sailed from the Port of Wellington, New Zealand on the Union Steam Ship &quot;Makura&quot;, which arrived at the Port of San Francisco, California, on February 9, 1934. He went to elementary school at Mission Dolores. He then went to high school at St. Ignatius College Preparatory. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of San Francisco and a Juris Doctor from San Francisco Law School, now integrated to Alliant International University.

==Career==
McCarthy joined the United States Air Force in March 1951, and served for twenty-one months until the end of 1952, as an enlisted man. He was in an intelligence unit at the Strategic Air Command and was stationed at Lake Charles, Louisiana for seventeen months. While at the Strategic Air Command, he spent a few weeks deployed to Saudi Arabia taking part in a mission to simulate the start of World War III. He also served in the United States Air Force Reserves for a few years.

===California Assembly===
In 1958, the year that saw the Democrats capture statewide offices for the first time since World War II, McCarthy managed the successful campaign for State Senate of J. Eugene McAteer. After the election, McCarthy served as McAteer&#x27;s administrative assistant.

McCarthy first ran for office in 1963, when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. He served there until 1967. In 1968, he was elected to the State Assembly, serving as speaker of the Assembly from 1974 to 1980. (Art Agnos, elected mayor of San Francisco in 1988, had his political start as McCarthy&#x27;s first legislative assistant, and later as the speaker&#x27;s chief of staff.) As speaker, McCarthy earned a reputation as a partisan, take-no-prisoners insider in Democratic Party politics.

McCarthy unexpectedly lost the speakership to Willie Brown in 1980. McCarthy had been facing a stiff challenge from Howard Berman. Seeing his fellow Democrats so divided, Brown worked with Republicans to gain the speakership. Both of the losers in this struggle soon left the legislature. Berman ran for Congress and McCarthy ran for statewide office.

===Lieutenant Governor of California (from 1983 to 1995)===
McCarthy was first elected to statewide office to the first of three consecutive four-year terms as lieutenant governor of California in 1982, at the same time that Republican George Deukmejian was elected governor. In 1986, the incumbent McCarthy ran against Republican Mike Curb, the former Lieutenant Governor and McCarthy&#x27;s immediate predecessor as well as a former film producer and music promoter with a reputation for opposing drug use by artists. In a hotly-contested race for lieutenant governor that centered largely around violent crime and drug policy, McCarthy alleged that Curb made a fortune in making &#x27;exploitation films&#x27; that glorified drugs, sex, and violence. Curb was so incensed at the charges that he filed a $7-million libel and slander suit against McCarthy, who ultimately won the election.

After his failed 1988 Senate campaign, McCarthy won a third term as lieutenant governor in 1990, while his 1988 opponent Pete Wilson won the election for governor.

=== 1988 U.S. Senate campaign ===

In 1988, McCarthy ran for the U.S. Senate. He easily won the Democratic Party nomination but was defeated in the general election by the Republican incumbent and future Governor Pete Wilson. As of 2021, this was the last time a Republican won a U.S. Senate seat in California. McCarthy&#x27;s 4,287,253 votes set a record for the most votes given to a losing Democratic Senate candidate that lasted until it was broken by MJ Hegar of Texas in 2020. McCarthy was the first person to get more than 4 million votes in a losing Senate campaign.

=== 1992 U.S. Senate campaign and retirement ===
In 1992, McCarthy entered the Democratic primary election for the U.S. Senate but lost the nomination to US Representative (and later general election winner) Barbara Boxer.

McCarthy retired from public office at the end of his third term as the state&#x27;s longest-serving Lieutenant Governor after 12 years in office on January 2, 1995, choosing not to seek re-election to a fourth term in 1994, even though he was eligible for one more term and would not have been term-limited until 1998. He was succeeded by a fellow Democrat, then-State Controller and later future Governor Gray Davis. McCarthy&#x27;s 12 years are the longest any California lieutenant governor has served. Upon leaving politics, he created an investment company, The Daniel Group, named for his father and located in San Francisco.

===Leo T. McCarthy Center===
He helped found the Leo T. McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good at the University of San Francisco.

==Personal life and death==
McCarthy was Catholic. He was married on December 17, 1955, to the former Jacqueline Lee Burke. They had four children (Sharon, Conna, Adam, and Niall) and eleven grandchildren.

After a long illness, McCarthy died from a kidney ailment at his home in San Francisco on February 5, 2007.

<text>Antonio de los Reyes Correa (c. 1665 – June 9, 1758), also known as El Capitán Correa, was a Puerto Rican native who served as a captain in the Spanish Marine Infantry. Correa and his men defended the town of Arecibo from an English invasion in 1702.

==Early years==

Correa was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico to Jose Rodriguez Correa and Francisca Rodriguez de Valdez Colon. He was in charge of the local militia whose mission was to protect Arecibo from attacks by pirates or other European powers. His claim to fame came as a result of his defense of the city from an attack by English forces on August 5, 1702.

==Defense of Arecibo==

As part of the War of the Spanish Succession, England was at war with pro-Bourbon Spaniards, and the conflict spilled over into the Americas. On August 5, 1702, two Royal Navy warships under the command of William Whetstone approached Arecibo. From them, two rowboats transporting 40 marines and sailors proceeded to land on the town&#x27;s beach. A force of 30 local militiamen, led by Correa, was mustered to confront the invaders. The ensuing engagement killed 22 of the attackers, while the defenders suffered one killed and three wounded, including Correa. Whetstone&#x27;s ships proceeded to sail away, ending the engagement.

==Honors and later years==

Correa was awarded &quot;La Medalla de Oro de la Real Efigie&quot; (The Gold Medal of the Royal Image), by King Philip V of Spain and given the title of &quot;Captain of Infantry&quot; on September 23, 1703. It was within Spanish tradition to name its Captain of Infantry to the position of Mayor. Correa served as temporary mayor of Arecibo from 1700 to 1701 and then as official mayor from 1701 to 1705. He also served as mayor from 1710 to 1714 and from 1716 to 1744.

Captain Antonio de los Reyes Correa, who was married to Estefanía Rodríguez de Matos y Colón Luyando, died on June 9, 1758. Arecibo is known as the &quot;Villa del Capitan Correa&quot; (Captain Correa&#x27;s Village), an honour bestowed by the people of the town. The people of Arecibo also honored Correa by including a gold colored belt in their Coat of Arms with the words &quot;Muy Leal&quot;, which means &quot;Very Loyal&quot;, in representation of Correa. On January 8, 2004, the Government of Puerto Rico approved public law #29 (P. de la C. 4029 LEY NUM. 29. 8 DE ENERO DE 2004) establishing August 5 as the Day of Antonio de los Reyes Correa. In the southern Puerto Rican city of Ponce a street was named after him. It runs from Barrio Segundo through Barrio Primero and ends in the northern portion of Barrio Canas Urbano at Avenida Las Américas.

<doc id="677443" wikidata="Q422282" url="?curid=677443" title="Homo faber">
<text>is the concept that human beings are able to control their fate and their environment as a result of the use of tools.

== Original phrase ==

In Latin literature, Appius Claudius Caecus uses this term in his &quot;Sententiæ&quot;, referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him: &quot;Homo faber suae quisque fortunae&quot; (&quot;Every man is the artifex of his destiny&quot;).

In older anthropological discussions, &quot;Homo faber&quot;, as the &quot;working man&quot;, is confronted with &quot;Homo ludens&quot;, the &quot;playing man&quot;, who is concerned with amusements, humor, and leisure. It is also used in George Kubler&#x27;s book, &quot;The Shape of Time&quot; as a reference to individuals who create works of art.

== Modern usage ==

The classic &quot;homo faber suae quisque fortunae&quot; was &quot;rediscovered&quot; by humanists in 14th century and was central in the Italian Renaissance.

In the 20th century, Max Scheler and Hannah Arendt made the philosophical concept central again.

Henri Bergson also referred to the concept in &quot;Creative Evolution&quot; (1907), defining intelligence, in its original sense, as the &quot;faculty to create artificial objects, in particular tools to make tools, and to indefinitely variate its makings.&quot;

&quot;Homo Faber&quot; is the title of an influential novel by the Swiss author Max Frisch, published in 1957.

<doc id="677444" wikidata="Q1236078" url="?curid=677444" title="Lerna">
<text>In classical Greece, Lerna () was a region of springs and a former lake located in the municipality of the same name, near the east coast of the Peloponnesus, south of Argos. Even though much of the area is marshy, Lerna is located on a geographically narrow point between mountains and the sea, along an ancient route from the Argolid to the southern Peloponnese; this location may have resulted in the importance of the settlement.

Its site near the village Mili at the Argolic Gulf is most famous as the lair of the Lernaean Hydra, the chthonic many-headed water snake, a creature of great antiquity when Heracles killed it, as the second of his labors. The strong Karstic springs remained; the lake, diminished to a silt lagoon by the 19th century, has vanished.

Lerna is notable for several archaeological sites, including an Early Bronze Age structure known as House of the Tiles, dating to the Early Helladic period II (2500–2300 BC).

==Myths==
The secret of the Lernaean spring was the gift of Poseidon when he lay with the &quot;blameless&quot; daughter of Danaus, Amymone. The geographer Strabo attests that the Lernaean waters were considered healing: 
Lake Lerna, the scene of the story of the Hydra, lies in Argeia and the Mycenaean territory; and on account of the cleansings that take place in it there arose a proverb, &#x27;A Lerna of ills.&#x27; Now writers agree that the county has plenty of water, and that, although the city itself lies in a waterless district, it has an abundance of wells. These wells they ascribe to the daughters of Danaus, believing that they discovered them ... but they add that four of the wells not only were designated as sacred but are especially revered, thus introducing the false notion that there is a lack of water where there is an abundance of it.

Lerna was one of the entrances to the Underworld, and the ancient Lernaean Mysteries, sacred to Demeter, were celebrated there, along with a festival called the Lernaea, which was also held in her honor. Pausanias (2.37.1) says that the mysteries were initiated by Philammon, the twin &quot;other&quot; of Autolycus. Heroes could gain entry to the netherworld via the Alcyonian Lake. Prosymnus aided Dionysus in his search for his mother Semele by guiding him to this entrance. For mortals the lake was perilous; Pausanias writes:
There is no limit to the depth of the Alcyonian Lake, and I know of nobody who by any contrivance has been able to reach the bottom of it since not even Nero, who had ropes made several stades long and fastened them together, tying lead to them, and omitting nothing that might help his experiment, was able to discover any limit to its depth. This, too, I heard. The water of the lake is, to all appearance, calm and quiet but, although it is such to look at, every swimmer who ventures to cross it is dragged down, sucked into the depths, and swept away.

At Lerna, Plutarch knew (&quot;Isis and Osiris&quot;), Dionysus was summoned as &quot;Bugenes&quot;, &quot;son of the Bull&quot; with a strange archaic trumpet called a &quot;salpinx,&quot; while a lamb was cast into the waters as an offering for the &quot;Keeper of the Gate.&quot; The keeper of the gate to the Underworld that lay in the waters of Lerna was the Hydra.

==Archaeology==
Excavations at the site were initiated under John L. Caskey in 1952, whose efforts initiated the series of publications of Bronze Age Lerna, &quot;Lerna&quot; I-V, inspiring many other publications.

Lerna was occupied in Neolithic times, as early as the fifth millennium BCE, then was abandoned for a time before the sequence of occupation from the Early to Late Bronze Age (Early Helladic through Late Helladic or Mycenaean period). On-site techniques of flint-knapping with imported obsidian and chert attest to cultural continuity over this long stretch of time, with reduction in the supply of obsidian from Melos testifying to reduced long-distance trade at the end of Early Helladic III, corresponding to Lerna IV.

The site of Lerna is one of the largest prehistoric tumuli in Greece (ca. 180 m by 160 m across), which accumulated during a long Neolithic occupation. The crest of the mound was levelled and extended in the Early Bronze Age (Early Helladic II period, ca. 2500–2200 BC), as at Eutresis and Orchomenus, for the construction of a new settlement, known as Lerna III in the site&#x27;s stratigraphy. Lerna III lacks signs of continuity with the previous occupation. It was strongly fortified by a double ring of defensive walls with towers and was the site of a two-storey palace or administrative center known as House of the Tiles, for the terracotta tiles that sheathed its roof (an early example of tile roofing). This building was destroyed by fire at the end of the Early Helladic II period. In the following period (Lerna IV = Early Helladic III) the site of the &quot;House of the Tiles&quot; was covered by an earthen tumulus and not built upon again, whether through respect or fear, until, at the end of the Middle Helladic period, shaft graves were cut into the tumulus, suggesting that the significance of the monument had been forgotten. Lerna was used as a cemetery during the Mycenaean age (Late Helladic period), but was abandoned about 1250 BCE.

Ceramics of Lerna III include the hallmark spouted vessels that archaeologists name &quot;sauceboats&quot;, with rims that sweep upwards into a curved spout, as well as bowls with incurving rims, both flat-bottomed and with ring bases, and wide saucers, sometimes with glazed rims, more pleasant for the drinker&#x27;s lips. Jars and hydria have swelling curves. Painted decoration is sparse; stamped sealing form decorative patterns on some pieces, or rolled scribed cylinders have been used to make banded patterns. Remarkably, banded patterns made with the self-same seal have been found at Lerna, Tiryns and Zygouries. The burning of the House of Tiles brought the Third Period at Lerna to a decisive close; a low round tumulus marked its undisturbed, apparently sacrosanct site.

Lerna IV (Early Helladic III) marked a fresh start, not as a fortified seat of central authority this time, but as a small town, with houses of two and three rooms with walls of crude brick set upon stone foundations; several had central circular hearths. Narrow lanes separated houses. A great profusion of unlined pits (&quot;bothroi&quot;) was characteristic of this phase: eventually they became filled with waste matter, bones, potsherds, even whole pots. The pottery, markedly discontinuous with Lerna III, shows a range of new forms, and the first signs— regular spiral grooves in bases and parallel incised lines— marking the increasing use of the potter&#x27;s wheel. Painted linear decoration in dark glaze on the pale body is characteristic of Lerna IV. Caskey identified early examples of the ware that in Middle Helladic contexts would be recognized as Minyan ware, and, among the few examples of imported pottery, a winged jar characteristic of Troy, perhaps Troy IV.

Lerna V is continuous with the preceding phase, distinguished largely by new styles in pottery with the sudden, peaceful introduction of matte-painted ware, the thick-slipped Argive version of gray Minyan ware, and a vigorous increase in the kinds of imported wares, coming from the Cyclades and Crete (Middle Minoan IA). A new custom of burying the dead in excavations within the houses or between them is universal at the period.

Modern geological techniques such as core drilling have identified the site of the vanished sacred Lake Lerna, which was a freshwater lagoon, separated by barrier dunes from the Aegean. In the Early Bronze Age Lake Lerna had an estimated diameter of 4.7 km. Deforestation increased the rate of silt deposits and the lake became a malarial marsh, of which the last remnants were drained in the nineteenth century.

<text>Emma Alice Margaret Asquith, Countess of Oxford and Asquith (&#x27;Tennant; 2 February 1864 – 28 July 1945), known asMargot Asquith, was a British socialite and author. She was married to British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith from 1894 to his death in 1928. Known for her wit, in late Victorian society she was a member of the famed aristocratic group of intellectuals called &quot;The Souls&quot;. An opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage, whose autobiography was lampooned, Lady Oxford and Asquith was a controversial yet colourful character in her time.

==Early life==
Emma Alice Margaret Tennant was born in 1864 at The Glen, the family&#x27;s country estate in Peeblesshire, the 12th and youngest child of Sir Charles Tennant, 1st Baronet, an industrialist and politician, and Emma Winsloe. She never knew one of her five sisters and three of her six brothers, who died young. She was of Scottish and English descent and was a great-great-granddaughter of John Walter, founder of &quot;The Times&quot;. Known always as Margot, Tennant was brought up at The Glen; Asquith and her sister Laura grew up wild and uninhibited. Asquith was a &quot;venturesome child&quot;, for example roaming the moors, climbing to the top of the roof by moonlight, riding her horse up the front steps of the estate house. Riding and golf were her lifelong passions.

The two girls were inseparable, entering society together in London in 1881. She and Laura became the central female figures of an aristocratic group of intellectuals called &quot;The Souls&quot; (&quot;You are always talking about your souls,&quot; complained Lord Charles Beresford, thereby providing them with a suitable label). Laura married Alfred Lyttelton in 1885 and died in 1888, and Asquith&#x27;s life was strongly impacted by these events.

==Mrs Asquith==

On 10 May 1894, Asquith married H. H. Asquith and became a &quot;spur to his ambition&quot;. She brought him into the glittering social world, which he had in no way experienced with his first wife, who Asquith had known and always spoke of warmly. Asquith also became an unenthusiastic stepmother to five children, who were bemused by Asquith, so different from their quiet mother. Violet Asquith wrote: &quot;She flashed into our lives like some dazzling bird of paradise, filling us with amazement, amusement, excitement, sometimes with a vague uneasiness as to what she might do next.&quot; In 1908, when Asquith became prime minister, Violet was the only child of his first wife still at home, and the two shared a deep interest in politics. In contrast, relations between stepmother and stepdaughter were frequently strained, prompting H. H. Asquith to write lamentingly of how the two were &quot;on terms of chronic misunderstanding&quot;.

Asquith bore five children of her own, two of them surviving infancy. Elizabeth Asquith, born in 1897, later married Prince Antoine Bibesco of Romania in 1919 and became a writer of some note. Anthony Asquith, born in 1902, became a leading English film director.

Until they moved to the prime minister&#x27;s residence at 10 Downing Street in 1908, the Asquith home was a huge house in Cavendish Square in London, with a staff of 14 servants. The residence of most importance in the life of the Asquiths was The Wharf in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire, built in 1912. It became their weekend home away from home, and it was there that literary, artistic and political luminaries would gather.

==Views on Suffrage and Politics==

Her husband was in office as British Prime Minister from April 1908 to December 1916.

Asquith was a staunch opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage, once saying in a letter that &quot;women have no reason, very little humour, hardly any sense of honour... and no sense of proportion&quot;. 
In 1909, on holiday in Clovelly Court, Devon, the Asquiths were followed by suffragettes Elsie Howey, Jessie Kenney and Vera Wentworth, whom Asquith recognised again at church. They also hid in her garden, covering plants with the colours of the movement: purple, white and green.
With other politicians&#x27; wives, she attended the debate on the aborted Conciliation Bill and, in 1911, she &quot;seemed highly amused at the earnestness&quot; of women&#x27;s suffrage lobbyists, whilst near to Constance Lytton and Annie Kenney, who remembered her as unpleasant and sarcastic. In 1912, an article in the newspaper &quot;Votes for Women&quot; told of Asquith&#x27;s &quot;stealth&quot; journey when travelling with her husband as Prime Minister, via Wolverhampton and the Holyhead ferry, to Dublin, where the ferry was met by a yacht of Irish Women&#x27;s Franchise League demanding the female vote be included in the Irish Home Rule Bill.

During World War I, Asquith&#x27;s outspokenness led to a public outcry. For example, she visited a German prisoner of war camp, and she accused her shell-shocked stepson, Herbert, of being drunk. The negative public and media response may well have contributed to the political downfall of her husband.

In 1918, she was publicly attacked in court by Noel Pemberton Billing, a right-wing MP, who was convinced that the nation&#x27;s war effort was being undermined by homosexuality in high society. He hinted that she was associated with the conspirators. 
Billing also published a poem, written by Lord Alfred Douglas, which referred to &quot;merry Margot, bound With Lesbian fillets&quot;.

==After the war==

In 1920, the mansion in Cavendish Square was sold and the Asquiths moved to 44 Bedford Square, a beautiful house formerly occupied by salonière Ottoline Morrell. She became Countess of Oxford and Asquith in 1925 when her husband was granted a peerage.

==Writings==
Asquith published her autobiography in 1920. Her writing style was not always critically accepted—the most famous review of Asquith&#x27;s work came from New York wit Dorothy Parker, who wrote, &quot;The affair between Margot Asquith and Margot Asquith will live as one of the prettiest love stories in all literature&quot;. 
Asquith&#x27;s autobiography was part of a new trend of revelatory political books written close in time to the events described, including Lytton Strachey’s &quot;Eminent Victorians&quot; in 1918, John Maynard Keynes&#x27; &quot;The Economic Consequences of the Peace&quot; in 1919 and Lord Beaverbrook’s &quot;Politicians and the War&quot; in 1928. In 1921, humorist Barry Pain published a book called &quot;Marge Askinforit&quot;, described on the cover as &quot;a rollicking skit on the Margot Asquith memoirs&quot;. Pain wrote in his author&#x27;s note that &quot;There was a quality in that autobiography which seemed to demand parody.&quot;

Asquith was known for her outspokenness and acerbic wit. A possibly apocryphal but typical story has her meeting the American film actress Jean Harlow and correcting Harlow&#x27;s mispronunciation of her first name – &quot;No, no; the &#x27;t&#x27; is silent, as in &#x27;Harlow&#x27;.&quot; 
The story was recorded by the Liberal MP Robert Bernays in his diary entry for 26 June 1934, but Bernays does not claim to have witnessed the alleged encounter himself.

===Publication of her diaries===
Asquith&#x27;s diaries covering 1914–16 were published by Oxford University Press in June 2014 as &quot;Margot Asquith&#x27;s Great War Diaries&quot;.

==Later years==
In the late 1920s, Asquith and her husband were seriously in debt: she admitted to owing £15,000 () and having pawned her pearls for £2,000 despite, she claimed, having made £18,000 from books and £10,000 from various writings. A whip-round of Liberal sympathisers had to be organised to provide for them.

Her husband left her only £300 () on his death in 1928 as he had to use his life insurance to provide for his children. She was left in near penury and her financial position caused her constant concern. Thereafter she made money by advising on &quot;matters of taste&quot; in interior design and advertising Wix cigarettes, often issued &quot;IOU&quot;s which she hoped would never be cashed and, beginning before her husband&#x27;s death, was given regular gifts of money by Lord Beaverbrook. After her husband&#x27;s death, Asquith slowly moved down the residential rungs to rooms at the Savoy Hotel. Her final home was in Thurloe Place, Kensington. She told Harold Nicolson that Neville Chamberlain was &quot;the greatest Englishman that ever lived&quot; for signing the Munich Agreement.

Her final overwhelming sadness was the separation from her daughter Elizabeth, who had been trapped in Bucharest since 1940. Asquith schemed for her rescue, but Elizabeth died of pneumonia in April 1945; heartbroken, she outlived her daughter by three months.

==Arms==
==In literature and popular culture==
Asquith&#x27;s autobiographical revelations about her boisterous youth and early suitors were satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie MacPherson story, &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; on 8 November 1920.

<doc id="677451" wikidata="Q2497866" url="?curid=677451" title="Effect system">
<text>In computing, an effect system is a formal system that describes the computational effects of computer programs, such as side effects. An effect system can be used to provide a compile-time check of the possible effects of the program.

The effect system extends the notion of type to have an &quot;effect&quot; component, which comprises an effect kind and a region. The effect kind describes &quot;what&quot; is being done, and the region describes &quot;with what&quot; (parameters) it is being done.

An effect system is typically an extension of a type system. The term &quot;type and effect system&quot; is sometimes used in this case. Often, a type of a value is denoted together with its effect as &quot;type ! effect&quot;, where both the type component and the effect component mention certain regions (for example, a type of a mutable memory cell is parameterized by the label of the memory region in which the cell resides). The term &quot;algebraic effect&quot; follows from the type system.

Effect systems may be used to prove the external purity of certain internally impure definitions: for example, if a function internally allocates and modifies a region of memory, but the function&#x27;s type does not mention the region, then the corresponding effect may be erased from the function&#x27;s effect.

== Examples ==
Some examples of the behaviors that can be described by effect systems include:
* Reading, writing or allocating memory: the effect kind is &quot;read&quot;, &quot;write&quot;, &quot;allocate&quot; or &quot;free&quot;, and the region is the point of the program where allocation was performed (i.e., each program point where allocation is performed is assigned a unique label, and region information is statically propagated along the dataflow). Most functions working with memory will actually be polymorphic in the region variable: for example, a function that swaps two locations in memory will have type .
* Working with resources, such as files: for example, the effect kind may be &quot;open&quot;, &quot;read&quot; and &quot;close&quot;, and again, the region is the point of the program where the resource is opened.
* Control transfers with continuations and long jumps: the effect kind may be &quot;goto&quot; (i.e. the piece of code may perform a jump) and &quot;comefrom&quot; (i.e. the piece of code may be the target of a jump), and the region denotes the point of the program from which or to which the jump may be performed.

From a programmer&#x27;s point of view, effects are useful as it allows for separating the implementation (&quot;how&quot;) of specific actions from the specification of what actions to perform. For example, an &quot;ask name&quot; effect can read from either the console, pop a window, or just return a default value. The control flow can be described as a blend of &quot;yield&quot; (in that the execution continues) and &quot;throw&quot; (in that an unhandled effect propagates down until handled).

== Implementations ==

=== Core Feature ===
* Koka is a statically typed functional programming language with algebraic effect handlers as a main feature.
* Eff is a statically typed functional programming language centered around algebraic effect handlers.
* Unison is a statically typed functional programming language with algebraic effect handlers (called &quot;abilities&quot; in the language) as a core part of the type system.
* Effekt is a research language centered around effect handlers and polymorphic effects.

=== Full Support ===
* Haskell is a statically typed functional programming language with several packages that allow for encoding of effects. However, Haskell is generally more focused on monads.
* OCaml 5.0 introduced support for experimental effect handler primitives, with plans to introduce a proper high-level syntax in the future.

=== Partial Support and Prototypes ===
* Scala 3.1 is a statically typed, functional and object oriented programming language with experimental support for effects that is limited to exceptions, in the form of a codice_1 capability.
* Java is a statically typed, object oriented programming language; its checked exceptions are a relatively limited example of an effect system. Only one effect kind — codice_2 — is available, there is no way to resume with a value, and they cannot be used with functions (only methods) unless the function implements a custom codice_3.

<doc id="677454" wikidata="Q463587" url="?curid=677454" title="American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions">
<text>The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) was among the first American Christian missionary organizations. It was created in 1810 by recent graduates of Williams College. In the 19th century it was the largest and most important of American missionary organizations and consisted of participants from Protestant Reformed traditions such as Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and German Reformed churches.

Before 1870, the ABCFM consisted of Protestants of several denominations, including Congregationalists and Presbyterians. However, due to secessions caused by the issue of slavery and by the fact that New School Presbyterian-affiliated missionaries had begun to support the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions, after 1870 the ABCFM became a Congregationalist body. 

The American Board (as it was frequently known) continued to operate as a largely Congregationalist entity until the 1950s. In 1957, the Congregational Christian church merged with the German Evangelical and Reformed Church to form the United Church of Christ. As a part of the organizational merger associated with this new denomination, the ABCFM ceased to be independent. It merged operations with other missions entities to form the United Church Board for World Ministries, an agency of the United Church of Christ.

Other organizations that draw inspiration from the ABCFM include InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, and the Missionary Society of the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches.

== Organization and functioning ==
The ABCFM conducted an annual meeting with a Prudential Committee (aka Executive Committee) that took care of day-to-day business. It elected a Corresponding Secretary to produce written documents, and a Treasurer to receive donations. It also had board members.

The ABCFM held its first meeting on September 5, 1810, and elected Samuel Worcester as corresponding secretary.

=== Corresponding Secretaries and other key leaders ===
* Samuel Worcester was the first corresponding secretary, starting in 1810. 
* Jeremiah Evarts, corresponding secretary of the ABCFM from 1821 to 1831
* At the 1822 annual meeting, board members elected officers: Evarts as corresponding secretary, John Treadwell as president, and Rev. Joseph Lyman as vice president. The Prudential Committee consisted of William Reed, Rev. Leonard Woods, Jeremiah Evarts, Samuel Hubbard, and Rev. Warren Fay.
* Elias Cornelius became corresponding secretary, serving Dec 1831 – February 1832 (his death) 
* Benjamin B. Wisner, Rufus Anderson (1796–1880) and David Greene (1797–1866) became &quot;coequal&quot; secretaries in 1832. When Wisner died (February 9, 1835), William Jessup Armstrong took his place. 
* Anderson, Greene, and Armstrong led as coequals from 1835 to 1846, with Anderson as foreign secretary, Armstrong as domestic secretary, and David Greene as secretary for American Indian missions and editor of the &quot;Missionary Herald&quot; Rufus Anderson continued as foreign secretary until 1866. Armstrong died in a shipwreck between Boston and New Jersey in 1846.
* Selah B. Treat was elected in 1843 as recording secretary. Rufus Anderson, Rev. David Greene, and Rev. William J. Armstrong were listed as &quot;Secretaries for Correspondence.&quot; (President and vice president were listed respectively as Theodore Frelinghuysen LL. D. and Hon. Thomas S. Williams) 
* By 1858, George Warren Wood was sole corresponding secretary, with Rev. Mark Hopkins as President and abolitionist William Jessup as Vice-President. Hopkins had been the President of Williams College since 1836. 
* By 1866, Rev. Nathan George Clark and Rev G. W. Wood had joined Rufus Anderson and Selah Treat as corresponding secretaries. Wood, as ABCFM Secretary in New York City, held his position from 1850 to 1871. Clark assumed the position of Foreign Secretary when Anderson left in 1866 and remained Foreign Secretary until 1894.
:Note: After some secessions due to the slavery issue and the movement of New School Presbyterian-affiliated missionaries to the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions, the ABCFM was left as a Congregationalist body after 1870. 
* In 1896, James Levi Barton became secretary when N.G. Clark died, and he retired in 1927.
* In 1899, James L. Barton, Judson Smith, and Charles H. Daniels are the three Corresponding Secretaries of the ABCFM according to &quot;The Congregational Yearbook&quot;. It also lists Charles M. Lamson and D. Willis James as ABCFM president and vice president, respectively.
* Henry H. Riggs&#x27; brother Ernest Wilson Riggs (former president of Euphrates College 1910–1921 and Near East Relief worker) joined James Levi Barton as associate secretary and corresponding secretary of the ABCFM from 1921 to 1932.
:Note: After 1930, the ABCFM revised its constitution to create the position of &quot;Executive Vice-President&quot; to provide a position that was &quot;first among equals&quot; amongst ABCFM secretaries.
* Dr. Frank Field Goodsell was the first Executive Vice-President of the ABCFM, which he led from 1930 to 1948.
*Alford Carleton served as executive vice president of the board from 1954 to 1970.
:Note: when the Evangelical and Reformed Church merged with the Congregational Christian Church in 1957, the Congregationalist-affiliated ABCFM merged with the E&amp;R affiliated Board of International Missions to become the United Church of Christ denomination&#x27;s United Church Board of World Ministries under Carleton On June 29, 1961, the ABCFM formally concluded. On July 1, 2000, a UCC restructure renamed UCBWM became &quot;Wider Church Ministries&quot; under the UCC&#x27;s covenanted ministries structure.

=== Board members ===
* Timothy Dwight
In 1826, the American Board absorbed 26 members of the United Foreign Missionary Society (UFMS) into its board.

==Early history==
In 1806, five students from Williams College in western Massachusetts took shelter from a thunderstorm in a haystack. At the Haystack Prayer Meeting, they came to the common conviction that &quot;the field is the world&quot; and inspired the creation of the ABCFM four years later. The objective of the ABCFM was to spread Christianity worldwide. Congregationalist in origin, the ABCFM also accepted missionaries from Presbyterian (1812–70), Dutch-Reformed (1819–57) and other denominations.

In 1812, the ABCFM sent its first missionaries – Adoniram and Ann Hasseltine Judson; Samuel and Roxana Peck Nott; Samuel and Harriet Newell; Gordon Hall, and Luther Rice—to British India. Between 1812 and 1840, they were followed by missionaries to the following people and places: Tennessee to the Cherokee Indians, India (the Bombay area), northern Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka), the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii); east Asia: China, Singapore and Siam (Thailand); the Middle East: (Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, the Holy Land and Persia (Iran)); and Africa: Western Africa—Cape Palmas—and Southern Africa—among the Zulus.

===The fight against Indian removal===
Jeremiah Evarts served as treasurer, 1812–20, and as corresponding secretary from 1821 until his death in 1831. Under his leadership, the board in 1821 expanded the role of women: it authorized Ellen Stetson, the first unmarried female missionary to the American Indians, and Betsey Stockton, the first unmarried female overseas missionary and the first African-American missionary.

Evarts led the organization&#x27;s efforts to place missionaries with American Indian tribes in the Southeastern United States. He also led the ABCFM&#x27;s extensive fight against Indian removal policies in general and the Indian Removal Act of 1830 in particular.

===1830 through 1860===
By the 1830s, based on its experiences, the ABCFM prohibited unmarried people from entering the mission field. They required couples to have been engaged at least two months prior to setting sail. To help the missionaries find wives, they maintained a list of women who were &quot;missionary-minded&quot;: &quot;young, pious, educated, fit and reasonably good-looking.&quot; The policy against sending single women as missionaries was not strictly followed and was reversed in 1868.
The secretary post was offered to Elias Cornelius in October 1831, but he became ill and died in February 1832. Rufus Anderson was the General Secretary of the Board from 1832 through the mid-1860s. His legacy included administrative gifts, setting of policy, visiting around the world, and chronicling the work of the ABCFM in books.

Between 1810 and 1840, the ABCFM sought firstly to proclaim the Gospel of Jesus Christ. At home and abroad, the Board and its supporters undertook every effort to exhort the evangelical community, to train a cadre of agents, and to send forth laborers into the mission field. As a leader in the United Front and early federal American voluntary associations, the Board influenced the nineteenth-century mission movement.

=== Missionary stations in 1855 ===
By 1850, the American Board had sent 157 ordained, male missionaries to foreign posts.

The January 1855 issue of the &quot;Missionary Herald&quot; listed the Current missions of the Board as follow:

===Recruitment efforts===
Orthodox, Trinitarian and evangelical in their theology, speakers to the annual meetings of the Board challenged their audiences to give of their time, talent and treasure in moving forward the global project of spreading Christianity. At first reflective of late colonial &quot;occasional&quot; sermons, the annual meeting addresses gradually took on the quality of &quot;anniversary&quot; sermons. The optimism and cooperation of post-millennialism held a major place in the scheme of the Board sermons.

After having listened to such sermons and been influenced at colleges, college and seminary students prepared to proclaim the gospel in foreign cultures. Their short dissertations and pre-departure sermons reflected both the outlook of annual Board sermons and sensitivity to host cultures. Once the missionaries entered the field, optimism remained yet was tempered by the realities of pioneering mission work in a different milieu. Many of the Board agents sought—through eclectic dialogue and opportunities as they presented themselves, as well as itinerant preaching—to bring the cultures they met, observed, and lived in to bear upon the message they shared. The missionaries found the audiences to be similar to Americans in their responses to the gospel message. Some rejected it outright, others accepted it, and a few became Christian proclaimers themselves.

===Other North American Missions to the Indians===
Among the North American missions of the ABCFM north or west of the displaced Southeast tribes were the 1823 Mackinaw Mission (Mackinac Island and Northern Michigan), the Green Bay mission (Michigan Territory at Green Bay), the Dakota mission (Michigan Territory/Iowa Territory/Minnesota Territory primarily along the Mississippi and the Minnesota (St. Peters) Rivers), the Ojibwe mission (Michigan Territory/Wisconsin Territory/Minnesota Territory/ Wisconsin at La Pointe and Odanah, Yellow Lake, Pokegama Lake, Sandy Lake, Fond du Lac, and Red Lake), and the Whitman mission in Oregon.

Missionaries of the Dakota mission experienced the explosion of Dakota violence in August 1862 at the start of the U.S.-Dakota War. Some of them attended the imprisoned Dakota and accompanied the exiled Dakota when they were forced out of Minnesota in 1863, especially those of the Williamson and Riggs families.

The Dakota mission translated the Bible into Dakota and produced a dictionary and a schoolbook. The Ojibwe mission translated the New Testament into Ojibwe and produced a number of schoolbooks, but used a now-abandoned notation style to do so. Both were among the first to render these languages in print.

===Work with indigenous preachers===
Indigenous preachers associated with the Board proclaimed an orthodox message, but they further modified the presentation beyond how the missionaries had developed subtle differences with the home leaders. Drawing upon the positive and negative aspects of their own cultures, the native evangelists steeped their messages in Biblical texts and themes. At times, indigenous workers had spectacular or unexpected results. On many occasions, little fruit resulted from their labors. Whatever the response, the native preachers worked on—even in the midst of persecution—until martyrdom or natural death took them.

Native preachers and other indigenous people assisted Board missionaries in Bible translation efforts. The act of translating the Scriptures into a mother tongue reflected a sensitivity to culture and a desire to work within the host society. Second only to the verbal proclamation of the Gospel, Bible translation took place in all sorts of settings: among ancient Christian churches, such as the Armenians and the Assyrian [Nestorian] church; cultures with a written language and a written religious heritage, such as the &quot;Marathi&quot;; and creating written languages in cultures without them, such as among the animistic people in Hawaii.

===Educational, social, and medical roles served by ABCFM missionaries===
Printing and literacy played crucial roles in the process of Bible translation. Similarly, the press runs and literacy presentations contributed significantly to the social involvement exhibited by the Board. To a greater or lesser extent, education, medicine, and social concerns supplemented the preaching efforts by missionaries. Schools provided ready-made audiences for preachers. Free, or Lancasterian, schools provided numerous students. Boarding students in missionary homes allowed them to witness Christian life in the intimacy of the family.

Education empowered indigenous people. Mostly later than 1840, it enabled them to develop their own church leaders and take a greater role in their communities. Board missionaries established some form of education at every station. A number of Board missionaries also received some medical training before leaving for the field. Some, like Ida Scudder, were trained as physicians but ordained as missionaries and concentrated on the task of preaching. Others, such as Peter Parker, sought to practice both the callings of missionary and medical practitioner.

== ABCFM in China ==
After the London Missionary Society and the Netherlands Missionary Society, the Americans were the next to venture into the mission field of China. The Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, representing the Congregational Churches of the United States, sent out Revs. David Abeel and Elijah Coleman Bridgman in 1829. They were received in February 1830 by Dr. Robert Morrison. These men worked first among the Chinese and Malays of the Straits Settlements. From 1842 to his death in 1846, Mr. Abeel devoted himself to establishing a mission in Amoy (modern Xiamen).

The American Board followed with many other appointments in rapid succession. Revs. Ira Tracy and Samuel Wells Williams (1812–1884), followed in 1833, settling at Singapore and Macau. In the same year Revs. Stephen Johnson (missionary) and Samuel Munson went to Bangkok and Sumatra. There were four great centers from which smaller stations were maintained. These were Fuzhou, in connection with which were fifteen churches; North China, embracing Beijing, Kalgan, Tianjin, Tengzhou, and Baoding, with smaller stations in the various districts of the center missions; Hong Kong; and Shanxi, with two stations in the midst of districts filled with opium cultivation and staffed by missionaries of the Oberlin Band of Oberlin College. One station was established in Taiku in late 1882 and the other, Fenchow in 1887.

At Tengzhou missionaries established a college, over which Dr. Calvin Mateer presided. Tengzhou was one of the centers for Chinese literary competitive examinations. Mateer believed that the light of modern science shown in contrast with &quot;superstition&quot; would prove effective. He and his wife taught astronomy, mathematics, natural philosophy, and history. He trained young men to be teachers all over North China. The young men whom he had trained in Biblical instruction began native ministry. Drs. John Livingstone Nevius and Hunter Corbett (1862–1918) co-operated in this latter work, by giving a theological education to candidates for ministry during a portion of each year at Yantai.

At its principal stations in China, the Society maintained large medical dispensaries and hospitals, boarding schools for boys and girls, colleges for native students, and other agencies for effecting the purposes of the mission. It also helped create the Canton Hospital. As of 1890 it had twenty-eight missionaries, sixteen lady agents, ten medical missionaries, four ordained native ministers, one hundred and five unordained native helpers, nearly one thousand communicants, and four hundred and fifty pupils in its schools.

==ABCFM in the Middle East==

The ABCFM founded many colleges and schools in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. For example, the American College of Sofia in Bulgaria is the successor to a Boys&#x27; School founded by the ABCFM in 1860 in Plovdiv and a Girls&#x27; School in Stara Zagora in 1863. They were combined in Samokov, Bulgaria in 1871, and moved to Sofia in the late 1920s.

<doc id="677457" wikidata="Q937063" url="?curid=677457" title="Michael H. Hart">
<text>Michael H. Hart (born April 27, 1932) is an American astrophysicist, author and white nationalist. Since 1978, he has published five books, most notably of the best-selling work, &quot;The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History.&quot;

== Fermi paradox ==
Hart published in 1975 a detailed examination of the Fermi paradox: the contrast between the extreme likelihood of extraterrestrial life somewhere in the universe and the total absence of any evidence for this. Hart&#x27;s work has since become a theoretical reference point for much of the research into what is now sometimes known as the &quot;Fermi-Hart paradox&quot;. Concerning Hart&#x27;s contributions to the study of the paradox, Geoffrey A. Landis writes: &quot;A more proper name for [the paradox] would be the Fermi-Hart paradox, since while Fermi is credited with first asking the question, Hart was the first to do a rigorous analysis showing that the problem is not trivial, and also the first to publish his results&quot;. Robert H. Gray views Hart as the proper originator of this argument, in Hart&#x27;s 1975 paper. Gray argues that the term &quot;Fermi paradox&quot; is a misnomer; that it is not the work of Fermi, nor is it an actual paradox (rather an argument).
 He therefore proposes that, instead of the (standard, but in his view incorrect) name &quot;Fermi paradox&quot;, it should be known as the &quot;Hart-Tipler argument&quot; – acknowledging Hart&#x27;s priority as the argument&#x27;s originator, but also acknowledging Frank J. Tipler&#x27;s substantial extension of Hart&#x27;s arguments in his 1980 paper &quot;Extraterrestrial intelligent beings do not exist&quot;.
Hart is an advocate of the Rare Earth hypothesis; he proposed a very narrow habitable zone based on climate studies. He advocated for this hypothesis in the influential book which he co-edited, &quot;Extraterrestrials: Where are They&quot;, in particular in the chapter he contributed to it &quot;Atmospheric Evolution, the Drake Equation and DNA: Sparse Life in an Infinite Universe&quot;.

==&quot;The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History&quot;==
Hart&#x27;s first book was &quot;The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History&quot; (1978), which has sold more than thousand copies and been translated into many languages. The first person on Hart&#x27;s list was Muhammad, chosen over Jesus or Moses. Hart attributes this to the fact that Muhammad was &quot;supremely successful&quot; in both the religious and secular realms. He also accredits Muhammad for his role in the development of Islam, far more influential than Jesus&#x27; contribution to the development of Christianity. Hart claims that Paul the Apostle was more pivotal than Jesus to the growth of Christianity.

== White nationalism ==
Hart has described himself as a white separatist and is active in white separatist causes. In 1996, he addressed a conference organized by Jared Taylor&#x27;s white separatist organization, New Century Foundation, publisher of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;. He proposed partitioning the United States into four states: a white state, a black state, a Hispanic state, and an integrated mixed-race state. 

At the 2006 American Renaissance conference, Hart, who is Jewish, had a public confrontation with David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and former Louisiana state representative, over Duke&#x27;s antisemitic remarks. Hart then stood up, called Duke a Nazi and stormed out and some participants jeered at Hart. After this incident, Hart left American Renaissance.

In 2009, Hart organized a racist conference in Baltimore with the title &quot;Preserving Western Civilization&quot;. It was billed as addressing the need to defend &quot;America&#x27;s Judeo-Christian heritage and European identity.&quot; Invited speakers included: Lawrence Auster, Peter Brimelow, Steven Farron, Julia Gorin, Lino A. Graglia, Henry C. Harpending, Roger D. McGrath, Pat Richardson, J. Philippe Rushton, Srdja Trifković, and Brenda Walker. In this conference, Hart compared Qur&#x27;an to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and Islam to Nazism.

<text>The Únětice culture, Aunjetitz culture or Unetician culture (, , , ) is an archaeological culture at the start of the Central European Bronze Age, dated roughly to about 2300–1600BC. The eponymous site for this culture, the village of Únětice (), is located in the central Czech Republic, northwest of Prague. There are about 1,400 documented Únětice culture sites in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 550 sites in Poland, and, in Germany, about 500 sites and loose finds locations. The Únětice culture is also known from north-eastern Austria (in association with the so-called Böheimkirchen group), and from western Ukraine.

==History of research==

The Aunjetitzer/Únětice culture is named after a discovery by Czech surgeon and amateur archaeologist Čeněk Rýzner (1845–1923), who in 1879 found a cemetery in Bohemia of over 50 inhumations on Holý Vrch, the hill overlooking the village of Únětice. At about the same time, the first Úněticean burial ground was unearthed in Southern Moravia in Měnín by A.Rzehak. Following these initial discoveries and until the 1930s, many more sites, primarily cemeteries, were identified, including Němčice nad Hanou (1926), sites in the vicinity of Prague, Polepy (1926–1927), and Šardičky (1927).
In Germany, a Princely Grave in Leubingen had already been excavated in 1877 by F.Klopfleisch; however, he incorrectly dated the monument to the Hallstatt during the Iron Age. In subsequent years, a main cluster of Úněticean sites in Central Germany were identified at Baalberge, Helmsdorf, Nienstedt, Körner, Leubingen, Halberstadt, Klein Quenstedt, Wernigerode, Blankenburg, and Quedlinburg. At the same time, Adlerberg and Straubing groups were defined in 1918 by Schumacher.

In Silesia, the first archaeologist associated with the discovery and identification of the Únětice culture was Hans Seger (1864–1943). Seger not only discovered several Úněticean sites and supervised pioneering excavations in locations in Silesia, now in Poland as Przecławice, but he also linked Bohemian European Bronze Age (EBA) materials with similar assemblages in Lower Silesia. In Greater Poland, the first excavations at royal Úněticean necropolis of Łęki Małe were undertaken by Józef Kostrzewski in 1931, but major archaeological discoveries at this site were made only years later in 1953 and 1955. In 1935 Kostrzewski published the first data and findings of the Iwno culture, another Bronze Age culture contemporaneous with the Únětice EBA, from Western Poland. In 1960 Wanda Sarnowska (1911–1989) began excavations in Szczepankowice near Wrocław, southwest Poland, where a new group of barrows was unearthed. In 1969 she published a new monograph on the Únětice culture in which she cataloged, analysed, and described assemblages deriving from 373 known EBA Úněticean sites in Poland.

The first unified chronological system (relative chronology) based on a typology of ceramics and metal artefacts for the Únětice culture in Bohemia was introduced by Moucha in 1963. This chronological system consisting of six sub-phases was considered valid for the Bohemian groups of the Únětice culture, and later was adapted in Poland and in Germany.

Recently, the Únětice culture has been cited as a pan-European cultural phenomenon whose influence covered large areas due to intensive exchange, with Únětice pottery and bronze artefacts found from Ireland to Scandinavia, the Italian Peninsula, and the Balkans. As such, it is candidate for a community connecting a continuum of already scattered, late Indo-European languages, ancestral to the Italo-Celtic, Germanic, and perhaps Balto–Slavic groups, between which words were frequently exchanged, and a common lexicon, as well as regional isoglosses were shared.

==Chronology==
The culture corresponds to Bronze A1 and A2 in the chronological schema of Paul Reinecke:
*A1: 2300–1950 BC: triangular daggers, flat axes, stone wrist-guards, flint arrowheads
*A2: 1950–1700 BC: daggers with metal hilt, flanged axes, halberds, pins with perforated spherical heads, solid bracelets

==Sub-groups==
The Únětice culture originated in the territories of contemporary Bohemia. Ten local sub-groups can be distinguished in its classical phase:
* Moravia Group 
* Slovakia Group; following the so-called Nitra Group
* Lower Austria Group 
* Central Germany Group 
* Lower Saxony Group 
* Lower Lusatia Group 
* Silesia Group 
* Greater Poland (Kościan) Group 
* Galicia (Western Ukraine) Group
==Artefacts and characteristics==

===Burials===
From a technical point of view, Úněticean graves can be divided in two categories: flat graves and barrows. The Únětice culture practiced skeletal inhumations, but occasionally cremation was also practised.

A typical Úněticean cemetery was situated near a settlement, usually on a hill or and in the vicinity of a creek or river. The distance between the cemetery and the adjacent settlement very rarely exceeds . Cemeteries were usually spatially organized, with symmetrical rows or alleys. Burials of the Únětice culture are orientated according to stars and the relative position of the sun on the horizon during the year, which may indicate quite advanced prehistoric astronomical observations.

==== Barrows–Princely graves ====

To date, over fifty Úněticean barrows have been found in Central Europe; the majority of the monuments have been published in archaeological literature, but only about 60% of that number have been excavated according to modern standards. Some of the tombs found in the early 19th century such as the many tombs in Kościan County, Poland, were incorrectly identified and robbed or otherwise destroyed.

The largest concentrations of Úněticean barrows, also known in archaeological literature as &quot;princely graves&quot;, can be found:
*in Czech Republicin the vicinity of Prague, e.g. Brandýs, Březno, Mladá Boleslav–Čejetičky–Choboty, Prague 5- Řeporyje, Prague 6- Bubeneč;
* in Central Germanyin, for example, Bornhöck, Leubingen, Helmsdorf, Baalberge, Dieskau II, Sömmerda I–II and Groß Gastrose;
* in Polandin Greater Poland, e.g. Łęki Małe I–V, in Silesia: e.g. Szczepankowice Ia–Ib, Kąty Wrocławskie.

The size of the tombs varies, with the largest of all originally being the Bornhöck burial mound (the largest Bronze Age burial mound in central Europe), dating from c. 1800 BC. The mound belonged to a ruler or &#x27;prince&#x27; who was likely associated with the Nebra sky disc. It was originally around 65 metres in diameter and 15 metres in height, but was mostly destroyed in the late 19th century. The mound was originally covered with white limestone (chalk) – a very unusual practice in central Europe but common in contemporary Bronze Age Britain. A &#x27;brotlaibidol&#x27; clay tablet was also found in the grave.

The largest surviving burial mound is Barrow No.4 at Łęki Małe, associated with the Kościan Group of the Únětice Culture which is 50 metres in diameter and 5–6 metres in height today. In the classic phase, a typical &quot;princely grave&quot; was approximately 25 metres in diameter and 5 metres in height.

===== Gold weapons =====
A gold axe and jewellery dating from c. 1800 BC were discovered at Dieskau in Germany and are thought to be associated with the ruler buried in the Bornhöck mound. A gold dagger dating from the Early Bronze Age has also been recovered from Inowrocław in Poland, associated with the Iwno culture. Gold weapons are known from other parts of Europe in this period, including a gold axe from Tufalau in Romania belonging to the Wietenberg culture, a gold dagger from Mala Gruda in Montenegro belonging to the Vučedol culture, a gold dagger from Dabene in Bulgaria, and gold daggers and halberds from Perșinari and Măcin in Romania belonging to the Tei culture. The Tei culture weapons were found buried with gold bracelets of Únětice type.

==== Flat graves ====
A typical Úněticean flat grave was a rectangular or oval pit 1-1.9 metres long, 0.6-1.2 metres wide and 0.30-1.5 metres deep. Depending on the shape of the bottom and depth, graves can be divided into four sub-types: rectangular, concave, trapezoid, or hourglass.

One of the most prominent characteristics is the position of the body in the grave pit. The deceased were always buried in a north–south alignment, with the head south and facing east. The body was usually placed in the grave in a slightly contracted position. Exceptions from this rule are sporadic.

In the classic phase (approximately 1850–1750 BC), the Úněticean burial rite displays strong uniformity, regardless of the gender or age of the deceased. Men and women were buried in the same north–south position. The grave goods consisted of ceramic vessels (usually 1–5), bronze items (jewellery and private belongings, rings, hair clips, pins etc.), bone artefacts (amulets and tools, including needles), occasionally flint tools (the burial of Archer from Nowa Wieś Wrocławska, for example, was buried with colour flint arrowheads).
A body deposited within a grave might have been protected with mats made from plant materials or a coffin, but in the majority of cases there was no additional coverage of the corpse. A well-known example of wicker-made coffin inhumation derives from Bruszczewo fortified settlement, nearby Poznań in Greater Poland. In approximately 20% of burials, stone settings were found. Erection of a full stone setting or just a partial one (a few stones in the corners of grave) seems to be quite a common practice observed in all phases of the EBA in Central Europe. Wooden coffins were discovered at several sites such as in Lower Silesia. Únětice culture coffin burials can be divided in two types, according their construction: coffins of the stretcher type, and coffins of the canoe type. Coffins were made of single block of wood. The most prominent example of a rich cemetery containing many of such inhumations is in Przecławice nearby Wrocław. Coffin burials appear in Central Europe in the Neolithic and are well known from Bell Beaker and Corded Ware cultures in Moravia.

===Metal objects===
The culture is distinguished by its characteristic metal objects, including ingot torcs, flat axes, flat triangular daggers, bracelets with spiral ends, disk- and paddle-headed pins, and curl rings, which are distributed over a wide area of Central Europe and beyond.

The ingots are found in hoards that can contain over six hundred pieces. Axe-hoards are common as well: the hoard of Dieskau (Saxony) contained 293 flanged axes. Thus, axes might have served as ingots as well. These hoards have formerly been interpreted as a form of storage by itinerant bronze-founders or as riches hidden because of enemy action. They have also been interpreted as evidence for the existence of organized groups of warriors or &#x27;armies&#x27;. Hoards containing mainly jewellery are typical for the Adlerberg group.

After 2000 BC a major expansion of bronze production took place, with tin bronzes becoming dominant. Ring ingots were exchanged widely. Special weapons and ornaments were produced as status symbols for high-ranking individuals.

The famous Nebra sky disk is associated with the Central Germany groups of the Únětice culture. Gold and tin used to make the Nebra disc was imported from Cornwall in southern England, whilst the copper was imported from Austria. According to the archaeologist Sabine Gerloff the gold plating (or inlay) technique used on the disc originated in Britain. A similar gold inlay technique is seen on the contemporary Thun-Renzenbühl axe from Switzerland, and has also been connected to Mycenaean Greece.

===Settlements===
Typical Úněticean housing structures are known from the Czech Republic and Germany. The houses were constructed of wood, with a gabled roof, and rectangular in plan with an entrance on the western side. The roofs were thatched, and walls were constructed using the wattle and daub technique.

One of the most characteristic features associated with settlements are storage pits of the Únětice type. They were located beneath the houses, and were deep and spacious, with a cylindrical or slightly conical neck, arched walls, and a relatively flat bottom. These pits often served as granaries.

The vast majority of settlements consisted of several houses congregated in the communal space of the village or hamlet. Larger fortified villages, with ramparts and wooden fortifications, have been discovered as well, in, for example Bruszczewo in Greater Poland and Radłowice in Silesia. These larger villages played a role as local political centres, possibly also market places, facilitating the flow of goods and supplies. The &#x27;proto-urban&#x27; fortified settlement of Fidvár in Slovakia was an important centre for the exploitation of nearby gold and tin deposits. Hillforts are known from the Late Únětice period, such as Cezavy in the Czech Republic which featured stone fortification walls.

Around 2300 BC, large circular enclosures were built at Pömmelte and nearby Schönebeck in central Germany. These were important ritual sites which remained in use until c. 1900 BC. Pömmelte is described as a central place of supra-regional importance. The largest known Early Bronze Age settlement in central Europe was built next to the Pömmelte enclosure. The remains of 130 large timber houses have been found on the site; they were typically 20 metres in length with some up to 30.5 metres in length, and with floor areas ranging from 80m² to 360m².

Some Únětice buildings were exceptionally large, such as the Dermsdorf longhouse (44m x 11m) and Zwenkau longhouse (57m x 9m), both in central Germany. These may have been elite residences, cult buildings, meeting halls, or &#x27;men&#x27;s houses&#x27; for groups of warriors or soldiers under the command of individual rulers. The Dermsdorf longhouse was built a short distance from a settlement at Leubingen, in direct alignment with the nearby Leubingen burial mound. A large number of axes were ritually deposited together in front of the longhouse, which may have belonged to a contingent of warriors or soldiers.

Experimental reconstructions of Bronze Age longhouses indicate that the builders must have had &quot;a complex system of numbers and data for linear measurements&quot; to manage such house building challenges. Construction techniques included the use of rectangular beams, planks and boards, mortice and tenon joints, scarf joints, single notched joints, slots, grooves, pivots, wooden pegs, and rebates.

===Trade===

The Únětice culture had trade links with the British Wessex culture. Únětice metalsmiths used pure copper as well as alloys of copper with arsenic, antimony, and tin to produce bronze. The cemetery of Singen contained daggers with a high tin content (up to 9%). They may have been produced in Brittany, where a few rich graves have been found from this period. Cornish tin was widely traded as well. A gold lunula of Irish design has been found as far south as Butzbach in Hessen (Germany). Amber was also traded, but small fossil deposits may have been used as well as Baltic amber.

====Weights and money====
Analyses of Early Bronze Age rings, ribs and axe blades from across central Europe have found that they had approximately standardised weights and probably served as a form of commodity money. In the first centuries of the second millennium BC, increasing precision in exchange was achieved by the introduction of lighter ingots. Certain artefacts (e.g. &quot;ösenrings&quot;) may have also been used as a type of token-money.

At the end of the Early Bronze Age rings and ribs were replaced by scrap and raw metal, indicating the development of weighing scales and the use of weighed metal as a means of payment. This weighing system may have emerged independently in central Europe through the serial production of bronze artefacts with perceptibly similar weights.

In 2014 the largest known hoard of copper rib-ingots was discovered in Oberding, Germany, consisting of 796 ingots, dating from c. 1700 BC. The find is associated with the Straubing group. Most of the ingots were tied together with tree bast in bundles of ten, each individual ingot weighing approximately 100 grams on average and the bundles weighing approximately 1 kilogram each. Forty of these bundles were further grouped into bundles of ten (or 100 ingots). This indicates the use of a decimal system. The use of approximately 1 kilogram weight is also unusual as the kilogram was first introduced as a unit of measurement in 1793.

====&#x27;Enigmatic tablets&#x27;====
Numerous (&quot;Brotlaibidole&quot;) made from clay (and occasionally stone) have been found across central Europe and northern Italy, dating from the Early and Middle Bronze Age, including in Únětice Culture sites. The tablets are marked with sequences of geometric figures, such as circles, lines, points, crosses, etc. The function of the tablets is not clear and the meaning of the incisions has not yet been deciphered. The prevailing theory is that they served a purpose in long-distance trade, possibly of metals. According to Harald Meller they probably represent a &#x27;sign system&#x27; involved in trade. They are often found broken in two which may indicate some sort of credit/debt system.

In 2010 a major exhibition was organized on the &#x27;enigmatic tablets&#x27; from the Archaeological Museum of Upper Mantua in Cavriana with the collaboration of thirty-five other museums. One hundred examples of enigmatic tablets were exhibited. In 2015 an international project was launched to study the tablets involving various Italian and foreign universities. The artefacts have been analysed and categorised using a three-dimensional scanning and measuring technique that allows for a precise morphological comparison to be made between tablets.

===Social organisation===

Archeological evidence from 2000 BC onwards points to the emergence of a more complex and ranked society in central Europe and the appearance of a new aristocratic leadership on top of the traditional clan-based organisation of farmsteads and hamlets. The effects were seen across all spheres of society from technology and economy to settlement and religion. The Únětice Culture in Central Germany in particular exhibited a remarkably high level of social complexity. Based on the funerary record, metal hoards and architectural evidence it has been suggested that by the 20th-19th centuries BC this society had developed into a type of state, ruled by a dominant leader supported by armed troops. This is further indicated by evidence for the surplus production and centralisation of agricultural goods, as well as the production of the Nebra Sky Disc.

===Calendar===

The main entrances of the Pömmelte circular enclosure were oriented towards sunrise and sunset midway between the solstices and equinoxes, indicating that it served as a monument for &quot;ceremonies linked to calendrical rites and seasonal feasting&quot;. These alignments marked the same dates as later Celtic seasonal festivals such as Beltane and Samhain, which celebrated the transition of the seasons, the harvest, or commemoration of the dead. 

The diameter and ground plan of the Pömmelte enclosure are almost identical to those of Stonehenge in Britain (built around 2500 BC), which was aligned with the solstices and has been interpreted as serving a calendar function. According to excavators of the Pömmelte site, the similarities between both monuments indicate that they were built by &quot;the same culture&quot; (the Bell Beaker culture) with &quot;the same view of the world&quot;. It has been suggested that the close similarity between Pömmelte and earlier earth-and-timber circular enclosures, such as the Goseck Circle in Germany (c. 4900 BC) and henges in Britain, may indicate a continuation of traditions dating back to the early Neolithic.

The Nebra Sky Disc, described as &#x27;the oldest concrete depiction of astronomical phenomena in the world&#x27;, is thought to depict a calendar rule for harmonising the solar and lunar years, enabling the creation of a lunisolar calendar. The cluster of stars next to the crescent moon is thought to represent the Pleiades, known from other ancient contexts as &#x27;calendar stars&#x27;, whilst the gold arcs on the edge of the disc (one of which is now missing) represent the angle between the solstices at the latitude where the disc was found. This feature also appears in a different form on the Bush Barrow gold lozenge from Stonehenge, dating from c. 1900 BC. The number of stars on the disc (32, or 33 if the sun is included) may represent the equivalence of 32 solar years to 33 lunar years. According to the archaeologist Christoph Sommerfeld the disc may also encode knowledge of the 19-year luni-solar Metonic cycle. 

According to the archaeologist Harald Meller the Nebra disc allowed for &quot;an extremely accurate positing of time, including even the capacity for predicting lunar eclipses.&quot; As such it represents &quot;the establishment of a new temporal order&quot; by elites of the Únětice culture, and thereby &quot;demonstrates their claim to state power&quot;.

The site on the Mittelberg hill where the Nebra disc was found is thought to have served as an enclosed &#x27;sacred precinct&#x27;, delimited by earthen ramparts on two sides of the hill. From this location, when the disc is aligned to the north, the upper terminus of the western gold arc points towards the Brocken mountain, where the sun is seen to set on the summer solstice (June 21st). Another distinctive marker on the horizon is the Kulpenberg hill, where the sun sets on May 1st (Beltane), a date also marked by the Pömmelte enclosure. 

==Influence of the Únětice tradition==
Today, the Únětice culture is considered to be part of a wider pan-European cultural phenomenon, arising gradually between the second half of the 3rd millennium and the beginning of the 2nd. According to Pokutta, &quot;The role of the Únětice Culture in the formation of Bronze Age Europe cannot be overrated. The rise and the existence of this original, expansive and dynamic population mark one of the most interesting moments in European prehistory.&quot; The influence of this culture covered much larger areas mainly due to intensive exchange. Únětice pottery and bronze objects are thus found in Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, and Italy as well as the Balkans.

The strong impact of Úněticean metallurgical centres and pottery-making traditions can be seen in other EBA groups, for example, in the Adlerberg, Straubing, Singen, Neckar-Ries, and Upper-Rhine groups in Germany and Switzerland, as well as the Unterwölbling in Austria. The Nitra group, inhabiting southern Slovakia, not only precedes the Únětice culture chronologically, but is also strongly culturally related to it. All of these groups are alternatively seen as local variants of a broader Únětice culture. According to Marija Gimbutas these cultures were, in a broad sense, &quot;one unit&quot;, with the same burial rites, economy, habitation patterns, and pottery, which she groups together as &#x27;early Únětice&#x27;. According to Sergent (1995) the Polada culture in northern Italy and the Rhône culture in France and Switzerland also represent southern variants of the Únětice culture. In later times, some elements of the Úněticean pottery-making traditions can be found in the Trzciniec culture as well.

==Genetics==
 examined the remains of 8 individuals of the Únětice culture buried in modern-day Germany c. 2200–1800 BC. The 3 samples of Y-DNA extracted belonged to Y-haplogroups I2a2, I2c2 and I2, while the 8 samples of mtDNA extracted were determined to belong to haplogroup I3a (2 samples), U5a1, W3a1, U5b2a1b, H4a1a1, H3 and V. The examined Únětice individuals were found to be very closely related to peoples of the earlier Yamnaya culture, Bell Beaker culture and Corded Ware culture. Their amount of steppe-related ancestry is comparable to that of some modern Europeans.

 examined the remains of 7 individuals of the Únětice culture buried in modern-day Poland and Czech Republic from c. 2300–1800 BC. The 7 samples of mtDNA extracted were determined to belong to haplogroup U4, U2e1f1, H6a1b, U5a1b1, K1a4a1, T2b and K1b1a. An additional male from the late Corded Ware culture or early Únětice culture in Łęki Małe, Poland of c. 2300–2000 BC was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup R1b1a and the maternal haplogroup T2e. It was found that the people of the Corded Ware culture, Bell Beaker culture, Únětice culture and Nordic Bronze Age were genetically very similar to one another, and displayed a significant amount of genetic affinity with the Yamnaya culture.

Papac et al. (2021) tested some more individuals from the Únětice burial sites: their the Y-chromosome results (not including two by low coverage samples) were: 1 G2a2b2a, 1 I2a1, 8 I2a2, 7 R1a-Z645, and 8 R1b-P312. The geneticists found that: &quot;The Y-chromosomal data suggest an even larger turnover. A decrease of Y-lineage R1b-P312 from 100% (in late Bell Beaker Culture) to 20% (in preclassical Únětice) implies a minimum 80% influx of new Y-lineages at the onset of the Early Bronze Age&quot;. The autosomal results even point to a migration from the northeast, which the authors can link with the arrival of R1a-Z645, previously found in the Baltic region.

Several individuals from two burial sites in Prague were tested in 2022 (both sites were used in different cultural periods), the male Y-DNA haplogroups from individuals assigned to the Únětice period were: two R1a1a1 (Z280), eight I2a2a (I6635), with an individual with the derived clade PF3885, a tested male was I2a-L38, and four males had the R1b-L2 haplogroup (another tested individual had the derived R1b-L20 clade); a male had the haplogroup R1b-Y153322, which is under DF27.

<text>An N11 code (pronounced &quot;Enn-one-one&quot;) is a three-digit dialing code used in abbreviated dialing in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP). The mnemonic &quot;N&quot; stands for the digits &quot;2&quot; through &quot;9&quot; and thus the syntax stands for the codes &quot;211&quot;, &quot;311&quot;, &quot;411&quot;, &quot;511&quot;, &quot;611&quot;, &quot;711&quot;, &quot;811&quot;, and &quot;911&quot;. These dialing codes provide access to special local services, such as &quot;911&quot; for emergency services, which is a facility mandated by law in the United States. The (FCC) in CC Docket 92-105, specified how the N11 codes of 211, 311, 511, 711 and 811 codes would be used for various types of public information under NANP.

==Services==
N11-numbers provide access to special services. For example,

*211: Community services and information
*311: Municipal government services, non-emergency number
*411: Directory assistance
*511: Traffic information or police non-emergency services
*611: Telephone company (telco) customer service and repair
*711: TDD and Relay Services for the deaf and hard of hearing
*811: Underground public utility location (United States); non-emergency health information and services (Canada)
*911: Emergency services (police, fire, ambulance and rescue services)

411 and 611 are commonly used in the United States, but not officially assigned by the Federal Communications Commission.

The designation for special use in the NANP prevents their use as area codes and central office prefixes, eliminating about 8 million telephone numbers from assignment.

The assigned use of each N11 code may vary for the various countries, US states, and Canadian provinces of the NANP, but 911 is mandated in the United States and Canada, 711 and 911 access is mandated by law in the United States, even within private networks (PBX, enterprise and cellular systems).

411 and 611 are supported by the service provider for the calling phone, but not all carriers provide these services. 411 and 611 (formerly 811) are typically blocked within enterprise or private branch exchange (PBX) systems, including cellular telephone service purchased for an enterprise system, since 411 calls generally incur a fee and the service is now readily accessible by other means, and 611 services are managed by the enterprise in which the phone resides.

Other community services are provided through 211, but only if a nonprofit organization, such as United Way of America, or the local government operates it locally. Likewise, local, state or provincial government may, but do not uniformly, operate traffic information using 511. 811 was made mandatory in the United States in 2007; however, it has not been universally implemented. 711 is funded through the TRS Fund, which telephone companies are mandated to maintain to provide Relay Services for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired.

==011==
Within the NANP, a leading digit of 0 or 1 indicates special dialing arrangements. &quot;1&quot; is the toll-dialing prefix, or &quot;trunk prefix&quot;. 011 is the international calling prefix, dialed before a country code to call internationally.

<text>Carlos Duarte Costa (July 21, 1888 – March 26, 1961) was a Brazilian Catholic bishop who became the founder of the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, an Independent Catholic church, and its international communion, which long after his death became the short-lived Worldwide Communion of Catholic Apostolic Churches.

The former Catholic Bishop of Botucatu, he was excommunicated by Pope Pius XII, ultimately for schism, but in culmination of several doctrinal and canonical issues (such as his views on clerical celibacy). Duarte Costa has been canonized as &quot;St. Carlos of Brazil&quot; by the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and ministry ===
Carlos Duarte Costa was born in Rio de Janeiro on July 21, 1888, at the residence of his uncle Eduardo Duarte de Silva. His father was João Matta Francisco Costa and his mother was Maria Carlota Duarte da Silva Costa, who came from a family heavily involved in politics and public service. He completed his primary studies at the Salesian College Santa Rosa, in Niterói, and at age nine, he received his first communion in the cathedral of Uberaba from the hands of his uncle, Dom Eduardo Duarte da Silva (now a bishop), on July 24, 1897. That same year he was taken by his uncle to Rome to study at the Pontifical Latin American College, a Jesuit minor seminary. In 1905 he returned to Brazil for health reasons and entered an Augustinian seminary in Uberaba, where he continued his philosophical and theological studies. He only narrowly managed to complete his studies and qualify for ordination, however, and his uncle intervened to vouch for his nephew.

After ordination as a deacon, Duarte Costa served in the cathedral church of Uberaba under his uncle, Dom Eduardo Duarte da Silva, who, on April 1, 1911, ordained Duarte Costa to the priesthood.

On July 4, 1924, Pope Pius XI nominated Duarte Costa as Bishop of Botucatu.

=== Attempts at church and societal reform ===
In 1932, Duarte Costa played an active role in the Constitutionalist Revolution, a failed attempt to restore constitutional government to Brazil. Duarte Costa formed a &quot;Battalion of the Bishop&quot; to fight on the side of the Constitutionalist troops and helped finance the battalion by selling off diocesan assets along with his own personal possessions. Duarte Costa&#x27;s battalion never fought, however, which was a source of disappointment to him.

In 1936, Duarte Costa made his second &quot;ad limina&quot; visit to Rome, meeting with Pope Pius XI. It is widely believed that he presented the pope with a list of radical reform proposals for the Catholic Church in Brazil, though no record of this survives. During this period he did become friends with another outspoken priest who would go on to achieve world fame, Helder Camara.

=== Bishop of Maura ===
In September 1937, Duarte Costa resigned from his episcopal post and was appointed titular bishop of Maura.

In 1944 he gained further notoriety by writing a glowing preface to the Brazilian translation of &quot;The Soviet Power&quot; by the Very Reverend Hewlett Johnson, the Anglican Dean of Canterbury known as &quot;The Red Dean&quot; for his uncompromising support of the Soviet Union. Duarte Costa consistently maintained his left-wing allegiance, calling for the establishment of a &quot;Christian communism&quot; in contrast to &quot;Roman [Catholic] Church Fascism&quot;.

As long as he enjoyed the protection of Cardinal Dom Sebastiao Leme da Silveira Cintra, Duarte Costa&#x27;s political activism proceeded without much trouble. However, soon after the cardinal&#x27;s death, Duarte Costa was formally accused by the Brazilian government of being a communist sympathizer. He was arrested on June 6, 1944, and imprisoned in Belo Horizonte.

=== Excommunication ===
After his release from prison Carlos Duarte Costa soon found himself in trouble again. In May 1945, Duarte Costa gave newspaper interviews accusing Brazil&#x27;s papal nuncio of Nazi-Fascist spying, and accused Rome of having aided and abetted Adolf Hitler. In addition, he announced plans to set up his own Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church, in which priests would be permitted to marry (and hold regular jobs in the lay world), personal confessions and the praying of rosaries would be abolished and bishops would be elected by popular vote.

In response to Duarte Costa&#x27;s continued insubordination, the Vatican finally laid against him the penalty of excommunication on July 2, 1945. Upon being informed of his excommunication, Duarte Costa responded by saying, &quot;I consider today one of the happiest days of my life.&quot; He immediately titled himself &quot;Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro&quot; and told the press that he hoped soon to ordain ten married lawyers and professional men as priests in his new church.

=== Founding of the ICAB ===
After establishing the &quot;Igreja Católica Apostólica Brasileira&quot; (ICAB), Duarte Costa continued to use the same vestments, insignia, and rites as he had in the Roman Catholic Church. This provoked the cardinals of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro to appeal to the Minister of Justice and the President himself for an injunction against both him and the ICAB. On September 27, 1948, the ICAB churches were closed by the courts, on the grounds that they were deceiving the public into thinking they were Catholic churches and clergy. Duarte Costa quickly filed an appeal, and in 1949 the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the ICAB could reopen its doors on condition that the church use a modified liturgy and its clergy wear gray cassocks to minimize the potential for confusion with the black-colored Roman Catholic clergy. The ICAB attracted the attention of scholars of Brazilian religions such as Roger Bastide, who described it as &quot;having both a religious and a political program, the latter [having] much in common with the Communist Party&quot;.

Unlike the official Catholic Church in Brazil, the ICAB developed friendly relations with Spiritism and Freemasonry. Duarte Costa &quot;began giving talks in Spiritist centers to publicize the new church&quot; and &quot;ICAB would go on to attract many members&quot; of Freemasonry. Duarte Costa also &quot;openly encouraged cooperation with Umbanda, Macumba and Candomblé communities&quot; when these are considered wholly incompatible with Roman Catholicism.

In the years immediately after founding the church, Duarte Costa consecrated four bishops, Salomão Barbosa Ferraz (August 15, 1945), Jorge Alves de Souza and Antidio Jose Vargas (both in 1946) and Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez (May 3, 1948). These bishops had intended to establish similar autonomous Catholic national churches in several other Latin American countries. Relations between the bishops were not always good, and Duarte Costa fought bitterly with Ferraz from the earliest days of the ICAB. His most fractious and quarrelsome relationship was with Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez however, whom he repeatedly denounced as a fraud and a charlatan. Duarte Costa consecrated eleven ICAB bishops in total.

<text>Donald Alan Thomas (born May 6, 1955) is an American engineer and a former NASA astronaut.

==Education==
Graduated from Cleveland Heights High School, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, in 1973; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics from Case Western Reserve University in 1977, and a Master of Science degree and a Doctorate in Materials Science from Cornell University in 1980 and 1982, respectively. His dissertation involved evaluating the effect of crystalline defects and sample purity on the superconducting properties of niobium.

==Early life and education==
Following graduation from Cornell University in 1982, Thomas joined AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey, working as a Senior Member of the Technical Staff. His responsibilities there included the development of advanced materials and processes for high-density interconnections of semiconductor devices. He was also an adjunct professor in the physics department at Trenton State College in New Jersey. He holds two patents and has authored several technical papers.

He left AT&amp;T in 1987 to work for Lockheed Engineering and Sciences Company in Houston, Texas, where his responsibilities involved reviewing materials used in Space Shuttle payloads. In 1988 he joined NASA&#x27;s Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center as a materials engineer. His work involved lifetime projections of advanced composite materials for use on Space Station Freedom. He was also a Principal Investigator for the Microgravity Disturbances Experiment, a middeck crystal growth experiment that flew on STS-32 in January 1990. This experiment investigated the effects of Orbiter and crew-induced disturbances on the growth of crystals in space.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1990, Thomas became an astronaut in July 1991. Thomas was turned down in his application to the astronaut program twice. He decided to differentiate from the applicant competition by getting his pilot&#x27;s license, teaching a university course and furthering his education. In his third application he made the group of 100 semi-finalists. After being invited to Houston, going through a one-week medical exam and interviews, he was still turned down. He eventually moved over 1,500 miles to live in Houston and was finally accepted on his fourth application.

Thomas has served in the Safety, Operations Development, and Payloads Branches of the Astronaut Office. He was CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for Shuttle missions STS-47, 52 and 53. From July 1999 to June 2000 he was Director of Operations for NASA at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Moscow, Russia. A veteran of four space flights, he logged over 1,040 hours in space. He was a mission specialist on STS-65 (July 8–23, 1994), STS-70 (July 13–22, 1995), STS-83 (April 4–8, 1997) and STS-94 (July 1–17, 1997). Thomas was also assigned to the ISS Expedition 6 crew, but his assignment was withdrawn over concern that he had already been exposed to too much radiation. Thomas logged over 1,040 hours in space.

In his last assignment, he served as the International Space Station Program Scientist overseeing NASA experiments performed on the ISS. Thomas retired from NASA in July 2007 in order to pursue private interests.

==Space flight experience==

STS-65 &quot;Columbia&quot; (July 8, 1994 – July 23, 1994) set a new flight duration record for the Space Shuttle program. The mission flew the second International Microgravity Laboratory (IML-2). During the 15-day flight the crew conducted more than 80 experiments focusing on materials and life sciences research in microgravity. The mission was accomplished in 236 orbits of the Earth, traveling 6.1 million miles in 353 hours and 55 minutes.

STS-70 &quot;Discovery&quot; (July 13, 1995 – July 22, 1995). During the STS-70 mission, Thomas was responsible for the deployment of the sixth and final Tracking and Data Relay Satellite from the Space Shuttle. Mission duration was 214 hours and 20 minutes, traveling 3.7 million miles in 142 orbits of the Earth. Four of the five astronauts were born in Ohio, so Ohio Governor George Voinovich made astronaut Kevin Kregel an &quot;Honorary Ohioan&quot;, making this flight &quot;The All-Ohio Space Shuttle Mission&quot;.

STS-83 &quot;Columbia&quot; (April 4, 1997 – April 8, 1997). The STS-83 Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, was cut short because of problems with one of the Shuttle&#x27;s three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth.

STS-94 &quot;Columbia&quot; (July 1, 1997 – July 17, 1997), was a re-flight of the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and focused on materials and combustion science research in microgravity. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.

==Post-NASA career==

Don Thomas is head of the Willard Hackerman Academy of Mathematics and Science at Towson University in Towson, Maryland.
He is a private pilot with over 250 hours in single engine land aircraft and gliders, and over 800 hours flying as mission specialist in NASA T-38 jet aircraft.

In 2013, Thomas wrote a book with the assistance of Mike Bartell, &quot;&quot;Orbit of Discovery: The All-Ohio Space Shuttle Mission&quot;,&quot; referencing the STS-70 flight.

==Organizations==
Tau Beta Pi; Association of Space Explorers (ASE).

==Awards and honors==
Thomas graduated with Honors from Case Western Reserve University in 1977. Thomas is the recipient of four NASA Group Achievement Awards, four NASA Space Flight Medals, two NASA Exceptional Service Medals, and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal.

In July 2014, Thomas, now a retired astronaut, was featured as a celebrity visitor to the spaceship &quot;R. U. Sirius&quot; in the comic strip &quot;Brewster Rockit&quot; by Tim Rickard, which is anachronistically set in the present time. On July 4, the spaceship crew recalls that his 1995 mission was delayed due to a woodpecker attacking his Space Shuttle. The same woodpecker appears, pecking at the windows of the spaceship, at which time Thomas confesses that he owes the bird money.

<text>Honorius II ( 1010 – 1072), born Pietro Cadalo (Latin &quot;Petrus Cadalus&quot;), was an antipope from 1061 to 1072. He was born in the County of Verona, and became bishop of Parma in 1045. He died at Parma in 1072.

==Biography==
Cadalo was the son of the Lombard Ingone, the son of Wicard, the son of Atone. The family may have originated at Monselice (39 miles, 63 km east-southeast of Verona), and entered the military service of the Count of Verona. In 992, Wicard is on record as owning the castle of Calmano, when he acquired territory at Lonigo in the County of Verona. His son Ingone acquired a house and other property in Verona in 1005, and in 1014 he had risen to the post of Vicecomes (vice-count, viscount) of the city of Verona. Ingone was dead by 13 July 1028, on which date his sons and heirs, Cadalo, Erizo and Giovanni, purchased additional property. It is stated in the documents that Cadalo was already in the clerical state (&quot;clericus&quot;).

===Ecclesiastical career===

By 3 September 1030, Cadalo had been ordained a subdeacon. He was a deacon by 31 July 1034. By 11 April 1041, he held the important post of vicedomino of the Church of Verona, administrator of the possessions of the diocese.

On 24 April 1046, Bishop Cadalo founded the monastery of S. Giorgio in Braida, on land which he had acquired the previous day in a transaction with Bishop Walter of Verona. Bishop Cadalo attended the diet held by the Emperor Henry III at Pavia in October 1046; even though he was accused of simony he signed the acts of the diet. On 1 May 1047, moreover, the Emperor granted the county of Parma to the Church of Parma and its bishop, Cadalo.

In 1048, Bishop Cadalo obtained from Marchese Boniface, the Lord of Tuscany, confirmation of the grant of the monastery of S. Bartolomeo in Pistoia to the monastery of S. Giovanni Battista in Parma.

In 1050, Bishop Cadalo attended the Roman synod of Pope Leo IX, which was held at the Lateran Basilica from 29 April to 2 May. On 1 May he subscribed Pope Leo&#x27;s letter to Bishop John, approving his transfer by the pope and synod from the diocese of Tusculum to the diocese of Porto.

When the old bishop&#x27;s house was destroyed by fire, Bishop Cadalo had a new episcopal palace built on a grander scale. It was in use by February 1055.

In the spring of 1055, Bishop Cadalo accompanied Emperor Henry III on his visit to Tuscany, where they met the newly consecrated Pope Victor II, an appointee of the Emperor. Conferences began on 27 May in Florence, and the Emperor and Pope held a joint synod in Florence on 4 June. On 6 June the Emperor issued a privilege in favor of the Canons of Parma.

Henry III died on 5 October 1056, leaving his crown to his ten-year-old son, Henry, under the regency of the Empress Agnes of Poitou. Victor II died on 28 July 1057.

The city of Parma was devastated by a major fire on 10 August 1058. The cathedral was so badly damaged that it could not be repaired, and Bishop Cadalo therefore broke ground for a new cathedral in a different place. The residences of the canons of the cathedral were also destroyed, and Cadalo built new ones next to the new cathedral. The building was finally consecrated by Pope Paschal II on 4 November 1106.

===Pope===
After the death of Pope Nicholas II (1059–1061) at Florence on 27 July 1061, two different groups initiated plans to choose a new pope. According to Cardinal Beno, the cardinals were aware of the ambitions of the Archdeacon Hildebrand, and immediately requested the Emperor Henry IV to name Bishop Cadalo of Parma as the new pope.

The reformist cardinals met under the direction of Hildebrand (who later became Pope Gregory VII), and sent a representative, the former monk of Cluny, Cardinal Stephen, to seek the permission of the emperor to conduct an election. After a five-day wait during which he was not received in audience, the Cardinal returned to Italy, without having received the &quot;congé d&#x27;élire&quot;. Three months after the death of Pope Nicholas, the reformists, who were still in Florence, then elected Pope Alexander II (1061–1073) on 30 September 1061. Alexander II (Anselm the Elder, Bishop of Lucca) had been one of the leaders of the reform party. He was able to enter Rome only through the violent support of Richard of Capua and his Norman soldiers.

====Appointment to papacy====
Twenty-eight days after Alexander II&#x27;s election an assembly of German and Lombard bishops and notables opposed to the reform movement was brought together at Basel by the Empress Agnes as regent for her son, King Henry IV (1056–1105), and was presided over by the Imperial Chancellor Wilbert. The council annulled the electoral decree of Nicholas II, and excommunicated Anselm of Lucca. It was argued in the ensuing pamphlet war that a pope whose jurisdiction is universal should be elected not only by the Roman people but also by the Roman emperor. With the assent of the assembly, on 28 October 1061 Henry appointed the bishop of Parma, Cadalus, as pope. He had been principally recommended to the German court by Bishop Dionysius of Piacenza and Bishop Gregory of Vercelli. He assumed the name of Honorius II.

In 1061, after his return from Rome, Pope Honorius II celebrated a diocesan synod in Parma.

In at the beginning of 1062, with the support of the Empress and the nobles, Honorius II and his forces marched towards Rome to claim the papal seat by force. Bishop Benzo of Alba helped his cause as imperial envoy to Rome. The army had advanced as far as Sutri by 25 March. On 14 April a brief but bloody conflict took place near Rome, just north of the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in the &quot;prato Neronis&quot; (prata S. Petri). The forces of Alexander II were defeated, and Honorius II took possession of the Leonine city and the precincts of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He did not enter the city of Rome, however, and did not hold his gains for long. A few days later, on the approach of the Duke of Lorraine, he withdrew to the fortress of Flajanum.

Honorius II was recognized as pope by the envoys of the eastern Emperor, Constantine X Doukas. They were in Italy to put together an alliance against the Normans and Alexander II, as part of the emperor&#x27;s plan to reclaim Calabria for the empire. They had already been treating with the Romans and with the imperial legate Benizo, hoping to include the German emperor in the enterprise.

Duke Godfrey of Tuscany and Spoleto arrived at the Milvian Bridge, a few miles north of the north gate of Rome in May 1062, thereby frustrating the efforts of the imperial agents. He induced both rivals to submit the decision about their legitimacy to the King&#x27;s decision. Honorius II withdrew to Parma and Alexander II returned to his see in Lucca, pending Godfrey&#x27;s mediation with the German court and the advisers of the young German king, Henry IV.

====Political change and attempted deposition====
In Germany, meanwhile, a coup-d-état had taken place. Anno, the powerful Archbishop of Cologne, had seized the regency, and the Empress Agnes retired to the Abbey of Fruttuaria in Piedmont. The chief authority in Germany passed to Anno, who was hostile to Honorius II.

Having declared himself against Cadalus, the new regent summoned the bishops of Germany and Italy to the Council of Augsburg (Concilium Osboriense) (27 October 1062), and, in the presence of the young King Henry IV, declared Alexander to be the true pope and Cadalo a pretender. He secured the appointment of an envoy to be sent to Rome to investigate charges of simony against Alexander II. The envoy, who was Anno&#x27;s nephew Burchard II, Bishop of Halberstadt, found no objection to Alexander II&#x27;s election. With the political change, Alexander II came to be recognized as the lawful pontiff by the German court. Alexander held a synod in Rome in the spring of 1063, during the Easter season, and had his rival, Cadalo (Honorius II), accused of simony (an old charge, dating back to 1045, and ignored repeatedly by popes and synods), seeking the papacy, attacking Rome, and counselling homicide; he was excommunicated.

Honorius did not, however, abandon his claims. At a synod of his own, held at Parma shortly after Alexander&#x27;s, he defied the excommunication, pointing out that he had been chosen by the German king acting as Roman patrician, while Alexander had been chosen neither by the clergy of Rome nor the Roman people, and had been intruded by the Normans, the enemies of the Roman people; Honorius levelled his own excommunication against Alexander. He gathered an armed force and once more proceeded to Rome, where he established himself in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo.

The ensuing war between the rival Popes lasted for about a year. After a siege of two months, Honorius II withdrew from Rome and returned to Parma. He continued to act as the pope, however, celebrating masses, conducting ordinations, and issuing bulls and apostolic letters.

====Formal deposition resisted====
The Council of Mantua, on Pentecost, 31 May 1064, ended the schism by formally declaring Alexander II to be the legitimate successor of St. Peter. Honorius II, however, maintained his claim to the papal chair to the day of his death. His successor, Evrardus (Heberardus) also rejected Gregory VII and maintained allegiance to Henry IV. He fought for Henry against Matilda of Tuscany, and joined the schism of Clement III (Bishop Wibert of Ravenna).

Cadalus died in Parma in 1072, still maintaining that he was pope, &quot;Apostolicus electus&quot;. His death is registered by Bonizo of Sutri as occurring just before the death of the bishop of Ravenna, Giovanni Enrico, which took place in 1072. His epitaph is preserved by Ireneo Affò.

<doc id="677490" wikidata="Q319689" url="?curid=677490" title="William T. G. Morton">
<text>William Thomas Green Morton (August 9, 1819 – July 15, 1868) was an American dentist and physician who first publicly demonstrated the use of inhaled ether as a surgical anesthetic in 1846. The promotion of his questionable claim to have been the discoverer of anesthesia became an obsession for the rest of his life.

==Early life==
Born in Charlton, Massachusetts, William T. G. Morton was the son of James Morton, a miner, and Rebecca (Needham) Morton. William found work as a clerk, printer, and salesman in Boston before entering Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 1840. In 1841, he gained notoriety for developing a new process to solder false teeth onto gold plates. In 1842, he left college after graduating to study in Hartford, Connecticut with dentist Horace Wells and Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep. In 1843, Morton married Elizabeth Whitman of Farmington, Connecticut, the niece of former Congressman Lemuel Whitman. Her parents objected to Morton&#x27;s profession and agreed to the marriage only after he promised to study medicine. In the autumn of 1844, Morton entered Harvard Medical School and attended the lectures of Charles T. Jackson, who introduced Morton to the anesthetic properties of ether. Morton then left Harvard without graduating.

==Career==
On September 30, 1846, Morton performed a painless tooth extraction after administering ether to Ebenezer Hopkins Frost (1824–1866). Upon reading a favorable newspaper account of this event, Boston surgeon Henry Jacob Bigelow arranged for a now-famous demonstration of ether on October 16, 1846, at the operating theatre of the Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH. At this demonstration John Collins Warren painlessly removed a tumour from the neck of a Mr. Edward Gilbert Abbott. News of this use of ether spread rapidly around the world, and the first recorded use of ether outside the USA was in London, England, by the dentist James Robinson in a tooth extraction at the home of Francis Boote, an American doctor who had heard of Morton&#x27;s and Bigelow&#x27;s demonstrations. The MGH theatre came to be known as the Ether Dome and has been preserved as a monument to this historic event. Following the demonstration, Morton tried to hide the identity of the substance Abbott had inhaled, by referring to it as &quot;Letheon&quot;, but it soon was found to be ether.

A month after this demonstration, a patent was issued for &quot;letheon&quot;, although it was widely known by then that the inhalant was ether. The medical community at large condemned the patent as unjust and illiberal in such a humane and scientific profession. Morton assured his colleagues that he would not restrict the use of ether among hospitals and charitable institutions, alleging that his motives for seeking a patent were to ensure the competent administration of ether and to prevent its misuse or abuse, as well as to recoup the expenditures of its development. Morton&#x27;s pursuit of credit for and profit from the administration of ether was complicated by the furtive and sometimes deceptive tactics he employed during its development, as well as the competing claims of other doctors, most notably his former business partner, Horace Wells. Just after working with him for a mere three weeks, Wells felt Morton could not be tolerated and ended the partnership. Morton&#x27;s own efforts to obtain patents overseas also undermined his assertions of philanthropic intent. Consequently, no effort was made to enforce the patent, and ether soon came into general use.

In December 1846, Morton applied to Congress for &quot;national recompense&quot; of $100,000, but this too was complicated by the claims of Jackson and Wells as discoverers of ether, and so Morton&#x27;s application proved fruitless. Horace Wells even addressed a letter to the editor of the Hartford Daily Courant, outlining his experiments and experience with anesthesia. Wells stated that he had met with Morton and Jackson in Boston “both of whom admitted it to be entirely new to them. Dr Jackson expressed much surprise that severe operations could be performed without pain, and these are the individuals who claim to be the inventors.” Wells’ letter also states he had preferred nitrous oxide over sulfuric ether for his experiments as being a potentially less harmful substance. After these people claimed to be the inventors of anesthesia, Morton made more applications in 1849, 1851, and 1853, and all failed. Morton later sought remuneration for his achievement through a futile attempt to sue the United States government. The lawyer who represented him was Richard Henry Dana Jr.

Morton&#x27;s notoriety only increased when he served as the star defense witness in one of the most notable trials of the nineteenth century, that of John White Webster, who had been accused of the murder of George Parkman. Morton&#x27;s rival, Dr Jackson, testified for the prosecution, and the residents of Boston were anxious to witness these nemeses in courtroom combat. His former tutor Dr. Nathan Cooley Keep, who had made the artificial teeth Parkman used, and identified it in the found remain, claimed the body was the victim&#x27;s. Morton initially denied Keep&#x27;s claim, but later changed his mind and agreed to Keep&#x27;s observation.

In 1852, he received an honorary degree from the Washington University of Medicine in Baltimore, which later became the College of Physicians and Surgeons.
In the spring of 1857, Amos A. Lawrence, a wealthy Bostonian, together with the medical professionals and influential citizens of Boston, developed a plan to raise $100,000 as a national testimonial to Morton, receiving contributions from both public and private citizens.

Morton performed public service yet again in the autumn of 1862 when he joined the Army of the Potomac as a volunteer surgeon, and applied ether to more than two thousand wounded soldiers during the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and the Wilderness.

== Death ==
Morton was in New York City in July 1868. He was riding in a carriage with his wife when he suddenly demanded the carriage to stop, and he ran into the lake in Central Park &quot;to cool off&quot;. This peculiar behavior was because he had suffered a major stroke (cerebrovascular incident) which proved fatal soon after.

Morton was taken to nearby St. Luke&#x27;s. It is reported by his wife that upon recognizing Morton, the chief surgeon made the following remark to his students:Young gentlemen, you see lying before you a man who has done more for humanity and for the relief of suffering than any man who has ever lived.
She then produced three medals, saying that the medals were all he had ever received for his work.

He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Watertown and Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
In 1871, a committee of those involved in raising the aforementioned national testimonial published &quot;The Historical Memoranda Relative to the Discovery of Etherization&quot; to establish Morton as the inventor and revealer of anesthetic inhalation and to justify pecuniary reward to Morton&#x27;s family for the &quot;fearful moral and legal responsibility he assumed in pursuit of this discovery.&quot;

Morton&#x27;s life and work were later to become the subject of the 1944 Paramount Pictures film &quot;The Great Moment&quot;. It was dramatised in the Australian radio play &quot;Dishonour Be My Destiny&quot;.

The first use of ether as an anesthetic is commemorated in the Ether Monument in the Boston Public Garden, but the designers were careful not to choose sides in the debate over the person who deserved credit for the discovery. Instead, the statue depicts a doctor in medieval Moorish robes and turban.

Morton&#x27;s first successful public demonstration of ether as an inhalation anesthetic was such a historic and widely publicised event that many consider him to be the &quot;inventor and revealer&quot; of anesthesia. However, Morton&#x27;s work was preceded by that of Georgia surgeon Crawford Williamson Long, who employed ether as an anesthetic on March 30, 1842. Although Long demonstrated its use to physicians in Georgia on numerous occasions, he did not publish his findings until 1849, in &quot;The Southern Medical and Surgical Journal&quot;. These pioneering uses of ether were key factors in the medical and scientific pursuit now referred to as anesthesiology, and allowed the development of modern surgery. Spread of the news of this &quot;new&quot; anesthetic was helped by the subsequent feud that developed between Morton and Horace Wells and Charles T. Jackson.

His son William J. Morton was a noted doctor and authority in electrotherapeutics.

==Personal life==
He had five children with his wife: William James Morton (1845–1920), Marion Alethe Morton (1847–unknown, after 1865), Edward Whitman Morton (1848–unknown, after 1870), Elizabeth Whitman Morton (1850–1922), Bowditch Nathaniel Morton (1857–1909).

<text>Leo M. Cherne (1912–1999) was an American economist, public servant, and four-decade head of the International Rescue Committee.

==Background==

Leo M. Cherne was born on September 8, 1912, in The Bronx. His father, Max Cherne, was a Romanian-Jewish compositor, who emigrated from Bessarabia to New York in 1904. Cherne graduated from New York Law School in 1935.

==Career==

First, Cherne practiced law.

===Research Institute of America===

During the New Deal, he specialized in Social Security and, with a Bible salesman named Carl Hovgard, sold a book about it. This venture grew into the Research Institute of America (RIA), founded to translate complex government legislation for the businessman. During World War II, he advised government on industry mobilization; after the war, he advised General Douglas MacArthur on how to reconstruct the economy of Japan. In 1947, Cherne, as executive secretary of the RIA, had Academy Films make a 30-minute counter-attacking movie called &quot;Crossroads for America&quot;. It came in response to the pro-union &quot;Deadline for Action&quot;. Carl Marzani of Union Films had made the 40-minute documentary &quot;Deadline for Action&quot; on behalf of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE) and &quot;severely criticized powerful corporations such as General Electric and Westinghouse,&quot; whose workers the UE had organized. At a press conference on 1 October 1947, Cherne presented his film by claiming, &quot;Avoidance of another major depression by steadily increasing productivity is the surest means to thwart Communist designs against the American economic and social system.&quot; Cherne also claimed that the film showed &quot;methods whereby American business concerns can counteract Communist influence on rank-and-file workers by supplying them with truthful statements.&quot;

===International Rescue Committee (IRC)===

In 1946, Cherne joined the board of the International Rescue Committee (IRC). In 1951, he became IRC chairman. In 1956, he personally helped deliver medical supplies over the border during the Hungarian uprising. He went to Cuba in the late 1950s early 1960s, Cambodia in 1975, and Kenya in 1977. Eventually, Cherne succeeded theologian Reinhold Niebuhr as IRC chairman. He resigned in 1991.

===Other activities===

Although anti-Communist, Cherne challenged US Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1952.

Cherne was a public policy expert who became a principal co-anchor of ABC-TV&#x27;s All-Star News, the first hour-long prime time nightly network news broadcast, in the 1952-1953 television season. While not a ratings success against entertainment programs on NBC and CBS, All-Star News is credited as pointing the way toward the format later used by long-form local news broadcasts in cities across America in the 1960s and beyond and by CNN and other national and international cable news networks since 1980. Cherne served as chairman of the executive committee of Freedom House, established to advance the struggle for freedom at home and abroad.

Cherne advised nine presidents by serving as a member of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board from 1973 to 1991. He was also a member of the U.S. Select Committee for Western Hemisphere Immigration and the U.S. Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs.

==Personal life and death==

Cherne was a gifted sculptor. His bust of Albert Schweitzer was displayed in the Smithsonian, his head of Abraham Lincoln in the Cabinet Room of the White House, and his bust of John F. Kennedy is in the National Portrait Gallery.

William F. Buckley Jr. called Cherne &quot;one of the most combative men ever bred... If he thought he was right about something, he would spend from now until doomsday pressing his view.&quot;

Leo Cherne died age 86 on January 12, 1999, in New York.

==Awards==
In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1984, US President Ronald Reagan awarded Cherne the Medal of Freedom for his &quot;moral passion&quot; in the service of refugees.

In 1989, Cherne received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

==Miscellaneous==

Cherne may have been the actual source of a popular quotation, often misattributed to Albert Einstein: &quot;The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is incredibly slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation.&quot;

<text>The Commodore 1551 (originally introduced as the SFS 481) is a floppy disk drive for the Commodore Plus/4 home computer. It resembles a charcoal-colored Commodore 1541 and plugs into the cartridge port, providing faster access than the C64/1541 combination. Commodore reportedly planned an interface to allow use of the 1551 with the C64, but it was never released.

Aside from faster access, the drive is very similar to the 1541. Like the 1541, it is a single-sided 170-kilobyte drive for 5¼&quot; disks, with each disk split into 664 256-byte blocks available for user data plus 19 blocks for DOS data and directory; the file system makes each block its own cluster.

==Hardware==
The disk drive uses group coded recording and contains an MOS Technology 6510T processor as a disk controller. The 6510T is a specialized version of the 6510 processor used in the C64, and it is only used in the 1551. The DOS limits the number of files per disk to 144 regardless of the number of free blocks on the disk because the directory is of a fixed size, and the file system does not allow for subdirectories. Its DOS is compatible with the 1541, so disks written by one drive can be utilized in the other.

The 1551 has no DIP switches to change the drive&#x27;s device number. If a user added more than one drive to a system, they had to open the case and cut a trace in the circuit board to permanently change the drive&#x27;s number, or hand-wire an external switch to allow it to be changed externally. It is possible to connect a maximum of two 1551s to one computer.

<doc id="677501" wikidata="Q2549328" url="?curid=677501" title="Wariʼ">
<text>The Wariʼ, also known as the Pakaa Nova, are an indigenous people of Brazil, living in seven villages in the Amazon rainforest in the state of Rondônia. Their first contact with European settlers was on the shores of the Pakaa Nova River, a tributary of the Mamoré River. Many of the Wari&#x27; live within the Sagarana Indigenous Territory near the town of Rodrigues Alves (which lies between Rio Guaporé Indigenous Territory and Pacaás Novos National Park).

==Name==
Europeans at one time used the name &quot;Pakaa Nova&quot; to refer to the Wariʼ, because they encountered the indigenous people near the Pakaa Nova River. The people prefer to be referred to as &quot;Wariʼ&quot;, their term in their language meaning &quot;we, people.&quot; They are also known as the Jaru, Oro Wari, Pacaas-Novos, Pacahanovo, Pakaanova, Pakaanovas, Uari, and Uomo.

==Language==
The Wariʼ speak the Pakaásnovos language, which belongs to the Txapakura, or Chapacura-Wanham language family.

Along with the Torá, the Moré (or Itenes), and the Oro Win, the Wariʼ are the last of the Txapakura language linguistic group. Other groups were exterminated by Europeans or Brazilians.

There is a large grammar of the Wari&#x27; language written by Barbara Kern and Daniel Everett: https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/001707

==Population and locations==
Up until the 19th century, the Wariʼ were present in the Amazon&#x27;s Southeast, namely the basin of the Lage River (a right-bank-tributary river of the Mamoré River), the Ouro Preto river, the Gruta and Santo André creeks, the Negro river (all tributaries of the lower and middle courses of the right bank of the Pakaa Nova River), and the Ribeirão and Novo rivers (tributaries of the left bank of the Pakaa Nova River).

In the early 20th century, continuous incursions by neo-Brazilians in search of rubber trees forced the Wariʼ to relocate to the less accessible headwaters of the Mamoré River. They were confined in that area until pacification. Today, they live in eight settlements located in the state of Rondônia, Brazil.

==Denomination and ethnicity==
The tribe is divided into subgroups, but there is no specific word to define an individual that belongs to a different group. The closest term that is usually applied is &quot;tatirim&quot; (stranger). A person from the same subgroup is referred to as &quot;win ma&quot; (land fellow).

Today, the Wariʼ subgroups are:

* OroNao
* OroEo
* OroAt
* OroMon
* OroWaram
* OroWaramXijein
Some individuals still identify themselves with two other subgroups that no longer exist, the OroJowin, or the OroKaoOroWaji. Oro is a collectivizing particle that can be translated as &quot;people&quot; or &quot;group&quot;.

==Relations between subgroups==
Present relations between subgroups are influenced by dynamics that existed before pacification. Each subgroup is intimately connected with a territory; however, the frontiers between territories are fluid.

An area associated with one subgroup can be incorporated into the territory of another subgroup (if it is occupied by a group that also belongs to another subgroup). This is made possible by the semi-nomadic characteristic of the Wari&#x27; people.

Membership to any given subgroup is not defined by fixed rules. Children may be considered members of either parent&#x27;s subgroup, or of the subgroup associated with the territory in which they were born. Cultural or subgroup identities are part of one&#x27;s birthright, but socially constructed during a lifetime through relations with one&#x27;s relatives and neighbors. The Wariʼ recognize that individuals have multiple identities based on their specific relations and experiences.

==Society==
Every subgroup is organized around a set of brothers, each of whom is often married to women who are sisters. Polygyny, especially sororal polygyny (co-wives are sisters), is the basis of the Wariʼ family structure. Villages are made up of nuclear families and a separate house, called &quot;the men&#x27;s house&quot;. It serves as a dormitory for single adolescents and as a meeting place for adult men. A couple usually varies their place of residence, shifting between the woman&#x27;s parents&#x27; and the man&#x27;s parents&#x27;, although no specific rule determines when the shift is made.

The Wariʼ are semi-nomadic, moving their villages at least once every five years. They stay away from floodplains but remain closer to the shores of small perennial rivers.

A maize swidden, providing the staple crop, is developed around the village. Finding the ideal earth for corn growing (black earth or terra preta) plays a key role in determining where to set up a village. The importance of agricultural land is also reflected in the language, since a person from the same subgroup is called a &quot;land fellow&quot;.

== Beliefs ==

=== Body, Soul, and Humanity ===
Aparecida Vilaça, professor of Social Anthropology at the National Museum, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro discusses the Amazonian concept of the body by drawing upon ethnographic research of the Wari’. First, it is important to note that humanity is not restricted to humans. Anything that acts human, i.e., performs rituals, has a family life, or drinks beer, may be considered human.

In the native language, Txapuakrua, kwere- is the closest word to the body and must be used in conjunction with a possessive suffix (his, her, its). Husband and wife are considered to share the same body, furthermore, all who live together are consubstantial. Vilaça describes kwere- as a “way of being.” For example, a person&#x27;s temperament is caused by their kwere-, an animal&#x27;s diet is attributed to its kwere-, and the wind&#x27;s strength originates from its kwere-. Vilaça asserts that this human/non-human parallel suggests a relationship to a “wider cosmological process.” The concept of the ontological turn is often used in regard to Wari&#x27; beliefs because the Wari’ interpretations of body and soul are so vastly unfamiliar to cultures that operate under the distinction of the divide between culture and nature into a dichotomy, which calls into question if all human viewpoints are comparable or perhaps even mutually intelligible.

After providing background on the concept of the body, Vilaça moves into a discussion about humanity. Wari’ means “we, people, human beings,” and is defined in opposition to game animals. Hunted animals can be considered human because they act as predators at times. The Wari’ warn that one must distrust their own eyes because the human form can be deceptive. The human form is seen as a good indication that something is a human, but may be deceptive as human bodies can be attracted to other subjectivities and transformed into them. The transformation of a body may be the result of the agency of another and not of the subject of transformation&#x27;s desire to transform. In one story, a child went to gather food with her mother in the forest. After noticing that they had been away from the village for days, the child grew suspicious. She noticed a jaguar&#x27;s tail between her mother&#x27;s legs and screamed until the animal fled and her mother was summoned again.

A transformation like this is attributed to the soul or jam-. Vilaça emphasizes that the body and soul are interconnected. The Wari’ believe that the soul gives instability and capacity for transformation. When a shaman sees the soul of an animal, he sees it as a person and is unable to kill it. Alternatively, the shaman may kill a fellow Wari’ because he views them as an animal. An animal appears differently in each person&#x27;s eyes. Furthermore, someone with a keen vision can view humanity in all things. Lastly, it is noted that metamorphosis generates fear because of its associated vulnerability and instability.

To the Wari’, seeing the soul of an animal has the potential to make one a lousy hunter because you&#x27;re no longer able to kill the creature that one observes as if it were too a human, the commonality of shared experience makes one unable to kill it. The reverse then may also occur, and the fellow human could be seen as prey. This concept is referred to by the author as “perspectival oscillation” and has the potential to happen to anyone at any time, and the signs that it&#x27;s happened are as subtle as small abnormalities in appearance or behavior.

==== Effect of Missionaries on Wari&#x27; concept of Body, Soul, and Humanity ====
The Wari concept of body is combined with one&#x27;s perspective whereas the Wari’ concept of the heart, or ximixi’, refers to the physiological organ, the core of something, and one&#x27;s emotional state, morality, and intelligence. In order for the Wari’ to consider someone a human being, they must have the quality of jamixi’ or the ability to transform into different bodies and perspectives. This transformation is understood to occur due to illness and transformation is viewed negatively as a loss of one&#x27;s wari’ or body and perspective. This, in turn, affects the way that they differentiate between Wari’ and other beings and affects the ways in which others view them. Christianity, where differentiation and dominion between human and animal is established immediately within the Bible, thus provided the Wari’ with a tool for differentiating themselves from animals and other beings. Another aspect of Christianity that was attractive to easing the anxieties of sense of self and relation among the Wari’ was the idea of Christian brotherhood. One major change that came about through the adoption of Christianity was the transition between a sense of being concentrated in the body to a being concentrated in the heart, allowing the Wari’ sense of self to be turned inward.

==Cannibalism==
The Wari&#x27; formerly practiced endocannibalism, specifically mortuary cannibalism. This was done as a form of utmost respect to those who had died.

Right after death, the closest relatives would hug and embrace the deceased person. The body would be left for about three days, although there was no set span, and depended largely upon how soon family members in other settlements could get to the funeral. By this time, the body had typically begun to decompose in the heat and humidity of the Amazon, sometimes reaching the stage where the body became bloated and discolored. When all relatives within a reasonable distance had arrived, the relatives respectfully prepared the body to eat.

Mortuary preparation involved ritual wailing and other ceremonies, building a fire, removing the visceral organs, and finally roasting the body. The decedent&#x27;s closest kin would not consume the body, but they urged the attendant relatives to eat. Consumption of the flesh would assuage the family&#x27;s grief, as it meant that the soul of the deceased would be kept in the living bodies of relatives instead of being abandoned to wander the forest alone. The practice was considered equally an act of compassion, affinal love, and grief. The relatives were encouraged to eat what they could, but this sometimes amounted to little more than small tokens of the spoiled meat. Even this consumption often caused the mourners great gastric distress. The heart and liver were eaten, but much of the body and hair was burned.

This practice continued until the 1960s. Today, Wariʼ do not practice any form of cannibalism. They bury their dead after two or three days of mourning.

==Warfare==
Today, the Wariʼ are peaceful, but before pacification they warred with neighboring tribes. Their most notable victories occurred over the Karipuna, a Tupi ethnicity, and the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau. With contact with the Brazilian government in the 20th century, the focus of their warfare shifted and they lost contact with the old &quot;wijam&quot; (enemy).

The Wariʼ consider enemies as &quot;former Wariʼ&quot; who have distanced themselves to the point of severing cultural exchanges. In spite of that, a Wariʼ warrior did not distinguish between an enemy and an animal, and thus felt no need to be merciful or gracious to an enemy any more than he would to an animal.

Once fighting was over, Wariʼ warriors would bring home the bodies of the fallen enemies whenever possible. Those bodies would be served to the women and younger men who had stayed home in order to strengthen the group. Children were prohibited from eating dead enemies.

The battle warriors retreated to the men&#x27;s house, where they stayed in quarantine. During this period they moved around as little as possible, staying in their hammocks for most of the day and drinking only chicha. The purpose was to &quot;keep the enemy&#x27;s blood within the warrior&#x27;s body&quot;, thus giving him strength. Sex was prohibited, as they thought the blood of the enemy would &quot;turn into semen&quot; and thus allow the enemy&#x27;s strength to be passed on to the tribesmen&#x27;s children. The warrior was not allowed to partake of the fallen enemies, because it was believed that he had kept the enemy&#x27;s blood within himself, and such an act would be self-cannibalism, resulting in his death. The quarantine ended when the women refused to continue preparing the chicha.

== Pacification ==
Pacification in this context is between the Wari&#x27; people and the rest of the connected world. It is important to note that the Wari&#x27; did not ask for this &#x27;pacification&#x27;. There are many perspectives on whether or not pacification of indigenous peoples is moral; therefore, it is important to define the distinction between pacification (peace) and a civilizing mission (assimilation/missionaries).

Prior to pacification attempts, interaction with the Wari&#x27; was extremely minimal. Starting in the 1950s, rubber tappers sought Wari&#x27; land for rubber trees. These rubber tappers resorted to exterminating Wari&#x27; villages and their people. As a result, the Serviço de Proteção ao Índio (SPI) began to attempt contacting the Wari&#x27; people.

Disease outbreaks and war over land from outsiders caused the population of the Wari&#x27; to reduce by nearly 50%. At the time, the Wari&#x27; had just begun to relocate themselves due to extreme rubber tree farming.

As a result, the Wari&#x27; turned to the Serviço de Proteção ao Índio and missionaries for assistance. The Serviço de Proteção ao Índio intentionally set up posts in order to meet and assist the Wari&#x27;. Due to the aforementioned disease outbreaks and rubber tappers, the Wari&#x27; eventually settled near these posts.

== Missionaries ==
Around 1956, the Wari&#x27; caught the attention of Protestant missionaries (and later Catholic and Evangelical missionaries). The Wari&#x27; were interested in the missionaries because of their generosity and their capability to cure disease.

The missionaries challenged Wari&#x27; beliefs by proposing new perspectives. The Wari&#x27; originally believed that all Wari&#x27; were brothers and that enemies were the same as animals. Missionaries changed the perspective of many Wari&#x27; to see all humans as brothers and animals as objects. This switch in perspective established the idea that fighting among brothers (other humans) was bad. To further convey their point, missionaries often lived alongside Wari&#x27; and attempted to learn the Wari&#x27; language. Parts of the Bible were translated into the Wari&#x27; language from 1975 to 1984. Following the translation of the Bible, was a collective conversion of the Wari&#x27; to Christianity for only about a decade in the 1970s and 1980s, followed by a collective reconversion.

After 9/11, which the Wari&#x27; were able to witness on TV, many converted back to Christianity believing that this was a sign of the end of the world. The post-9/11 Christianity practiced by the Wari’ population, can be differentiated from the missionary led Christianity from 1975 to 1984, as it was almost entirely led by native faith leaders and taught in their native language.

This was not without cruelty. The Wari&#x27; were forced to work full time on large plantations and in other enterprises in order to receive assistance and teachings. They were forced to obey orders, they were sent to forced isolation, and they were punished with jets of cold water when showing traditional values/beliefs. Despite this, the converted Wari&#x27; people decided that this was worth the new ideology and material benefits. Deconversion was also common with converted Wari&#x27;, but deconversion usually did not last long.

By the 2000s, a large majority of Wari&#x27; had gone back to their original traditions – only 30% remain Christian as of 2019.

<text>Susan Kilrain (born Susan Leigh Still, October 24, 1961) is an American aerospace engineer, United States Navy officer and NASA astronaut. She is the youngest person to pilot a Space Shuttle. She has flown more than 3,000 hours and among her merits she was awarded with the Defense Superior Service Medal.

== Biography ==
Kilrain was born on October 24, 1961, in Augusta, Georgia. She is the only sister among nine siblings. During her childhood she expressed her interest in becoming an astronaut and her family supported her dream. She started flying in high school where she had a month off during her senior year and completed training to become a private pilot.

Kilrain graduated from the Walnut Hill School, Natick, Massachusetts, in 1979. In 1982, she obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in aeronautical engineering from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. She received her master of science degree in aerospace engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in 1985. During her time in graduate school she worked as a Wind Tunnel Project Officer for Lockheed Corporation.

In January 1985, she had the chance to speak with Dick Scobee, who one year later died as commander of the Challenger STS-51-L. Scobee advised that she should join the military as a pilot if she wanted to increase her chances of being accepted into the astronaut program. In 1985, she joined the US Navy. She quickly realized that the Navy was not an organisation that was friendly to women and that it was reluctant to accept her. She was quoted as saying:I realized that I was a woman in a man&#x27;s world, so I was going to be an outsider. My whole philosophy was not to make waves. My goal was to be an astronaut. I wanted to fit in without accepting unacceptable behavior.Susan served as the Legislative Specialist for Shuttle for the Office of Legislative Affairs at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. She retired from the Astronaut Office in December 2002 and from the US Navy later in 2005.

Since her retirement she works as a motivational speaker. She has participated in the space camp named &quot;Space 2101&quot; in 2022 at the Dubai International Academy (DIA) Al Barsha, and in 2023 at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology. During the space camp in Dubai 2,299 students representing 108 nationalities, from five schools achieved a Guinness Book of World Record for &quot;the world&#x27;s largest space exploration lesson across multiple venues&quot;.

=== Personal life ===
She is married to Vice Admiral Colin J. Kilrain. The couple has four children and reside in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She loves photography and traveling, as well as martial arts, triathlon and playing the piano.

With the space historian Francis French, Kilrain co-authored a children&#x27;s book named &quot;An Unlikely Astronaut.&quot;

== Military career ==
Kilrain was commissioned into the US Navy in 1985. In 1987, she was designated a Naval Aviator. She was selected to be a flight instructor in the TA-4J Skyhawk. Later she flew EA-6A Electric Intruders for Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 33 (VAQ-33) in Key West, Florida. Upon completing the US Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, she reported to Fighter Squadron 101 (VF-101) in Virginia Beach, Virginia, for F-14 Tomcat training. Throughout her career, has logged over 3,000 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.

== NASA career ==
In 1995, she was selected by NASA as part of the 15th Astronaut Training Group. The group was selected to provide pilots, engineers, and astronauts for space shuttle flights. After a year of training, she worked on technical issues for the Vehicle Systems and Operations Branch of the Astronaut Office. She also served as spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control during launch and entry for numerous missions.

In 1997, she flew to space twice as a shuttle pilot on the missions STS-83 (April 4 to 8, 1997) and STS-94 (July 1 to 17, 1997). The STS-83 mission delivered to space a Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1), a collection of 33 microgravity experiments housed inside the Spacelab. The goal of this mission was to test hardware, facilities, and procedures being developed in views of the long term research program on the future International Space Station. The mission, which was supposed to last 16 days was cut short because of problems with one of the Shuttle&#x27;s three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth. In July 1997 the STS-83 mission was renamed as STS-94 and represented a re-flight of the MSL-1 Spacelab mission. This mission focused on materials and combustion science research in microgravity. Mission duration was 376 hours and 45 minutes, traveling 6.3 million miles in 251 orbits of the Earth.

Susan logged 472 hours in space over two missions and is the second woman to pilot a space shuttle. She recalled the first moments of piloting the space shuttle alongside the senior pilot and mission-in-charge.Looking down at Earth from space the first time … it&#x27;s like every dream come true. Even though you’ve seen pictures of Earth from space, it&#x27;s not the same as being in space and looking at Earth. It was very rewarding.

== Awards and honors ==
Throughout her career she has been recognized and awarded in multiple occasions.
*Distinguished Graduate of Naval Aviation – Awarded by the Officer Candidate School.
*Distinguished Graduate of the United States Naval Test Pilot School, Class 103.
*Defense Superior Service Medal.
