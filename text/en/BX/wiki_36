<text>Hackney Marshes is an area of open space in London&#x27;s Lower Lea Valley, lying on the western bank of the River Lea. It takes its name from its position on the eastern boundary of Hackney, the principal part of the London Borough of Hackney, and from its origin as an area of true marsh.

The marshes were extensively drained from Medieval times onwards, and rubble was dumped here from buildings damaged by air raids during World War II, raising the level of the ground.

The principal area of the marsh lies below Lea Bridge Road between the Old River Lea, and the Hackney Cut – an artificial channel of the Lee Navigation, dug about 1770, to avoid a loop in the natural watercourse. The southern extent is marked by the A12; although the industrial land around Hackney Wick Stadium was originally an extension of the marsh, it now forms a part of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Hackney Marsh is one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London, with of protected commons.

==History==
===The marsh===
The River itself was always an important waterway, being navigable to Hertfordshire; the Marsh was formed by the periodic flooding of the river, and so formed useful pasture, but could not be occupied permanently. Before the 10th century, the estuary of the river came as far as Hackney Wick, crossed at Old Ford. Marsh Road, the continuation of Homerton High Street, led to the marshes, and thence to Temple Mills. The Romans appear to have built a significant stone causeway across the marshes here; a periodical, the &quot;Ambulator&quot; of 1774, noted there have been discovered within the last few years the remains of a great causeway of stone, which, by the Roman coins found there, would appear to have been one of the famous highways made by the Romans The river forms a natural boundary, so in 527 AD it formed the boundary between the Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Middlesex. In the 9th century, it formed a part of the Danelaw boundary and reputedly, King Alfred stranded an invading Viking fleet here in 895 AD. This was achieved by draining the river where it met the River Thames, but the increased drainage affected river navigability, until it was restored in the 17th century.

By medieval times, both sides had become counties in England, and attempts were made to control the flow of water through the marshes. Mills were established including the Knights Templar mill at Temple Mills. Much of the marsh was &#x27;owned&#x27; by the Templars and used for pasture. When the Templars were abolished, the land passed to the Knights Hospitaller, and thence to the Crown during the Reformation, when monastic lands were seized. At this time, much of the land was associated with the Hackney village of Lower Homerton and with the large manor house at Hackney Wick.

Around 1770, the river was straightened by the construction of the Hackney Cut, now forming the western extent of the marsh. The natural watercourse passes to the east over the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, just below Lea Bridge Road. A nature reserve occupies the former Middlesex Filter beds on the island between the two watercourses.

By 1795, the former Templar mills were being used for preparing lead (submerged in urine, and heated by decaying cow dung, the lead was converted to lead oxide, and then finely ground to form a pigment for white, yellow and red lead paint). A new watermill was established on the Crown land of the marshes by Prince Rupert for an improved method of boring guns, however the secret died with him in 1682 and the enterprise collapsed.

At the end of the 19th century Hackney suffered from increased demand for building land, both for housing and to extend the factories in Homerton. The marshes had always suffered periodic flooding from the Lea but with the introduction of mains sewerage a flood relief sewer was constructed beneath the marshes. Most common and Lammas lands were then preserved by an Act of Parliament and passed to the control of the Metropolitan Board of Works, but the marsh remained excluded from the MBW scheme because many of the lammas rights were still exercised, predominantly grazing. This was a period of increasing arguments between landowners and groups, such as the Eton Manor Mission, who were trying to use the marsh for recreation. The of marshes were finally preserved by the London County Council in 1890, by purchasing the rights and landowners&#x27; interests for £75,000. They opened to the public in 1893 by the Chairman of the LCC, Sir John Hutton and were formally dedicated in 1894. The LCC undertook further flood prevention, straightening some of the bends in the River by introducing four &#x27;cuts&#x27;, the old channels being retained to form islands.

There were few houses on the marshes, but a notable exception was the White House Inn, by a bridge on the old road to Leyton. Originally built as part of a Lea fishery scheme, the pub is now long gone but a bridge remains, rebuilt to supply anti-aircraft batteries during World War II.
In the Marshes towards Hackney Wick were low public houses, the haunt of highwaymen and their Dulcineas. Dick Turpin was a constant guest at the &quot;White House,&quot; or &quot;Tyler&#x27;s Ferry,&quot; near Joe Sowter&#x27;s cock-pit at Temple Mills; and few police-officers were bold enough to approach the spot.

Small areas of the marsh have been taken for housing and sports fields and others added. were taken in 1915 to build the &#x27;National Projectile Factory&#x27;; after World War I, in 1922 this site was used to create the Mabley Green recreation ground. A further were taken in 1937 for the building of the Kingsmead Estate. Hackney Power Station was situated to the north west of the marshes, across the Lee Navigation, and operated between 1901 and 1976.

Between the 1970s and 1990s, a camping site was situated at the north end of the Marshes, adjacent to Cow Bridge, at one point branded as Tent City.

The Lesney die cast model factory was built on the Homerton side of the Lee Navigation in the 1940s, having success for many years with their &quot;Matchbox&quot; brand. The factory was a major local employer and closed in 1990.

===Sport===

In 1881, men from Homerton College, then still in the London area, founded the Glyn Cricket Club. Members of the cricket club then decided to form a football section to keep fit during the winter months, this football section was to become the famous Clapton Orient Football Club which for thirty years played its home games at Millfields Road Stadium (1900–1930). In 1946 the Club was renamed Leyton Orient and their home ground is now the Matchroom Stadium in Brisbane Road, Leyton, E10 5NF.

Today the marshes provide many pleasant walks, in reach of the inner city, but the most famous use of Hackney Marshes is for Sunday league football, with 88 full-size football pitches marked out. On a typical Sunday, over 100 matches are played by amateur teams in several local leagues, such as the Hackney and Leyton Sunday League and the Camden Sunday League.

In 2006 there was a dispute between the London Borough of Hackney and Nike, Inc. over the company&#x27;s use of the borough logo on their sportswear. The dispute was settled with payment of £300,000 going to support local youth sports groups.

The annual Hackney Half marathon, taking place in May, starts and finishes at the marshes.

===London Olympics 2012===

Part of the London Olympic park for the Summer Olympics of 2012 was built on Hackney Marshes. This caused some controversy with local residents&#x27; groups, who expressed concerns that East Marsh was to be tarmacked and used as a disabled coach park for the games. This was a temporary measure.

Arena Fields, however, was lost to the Olympic Park and its site will become part of the legacy Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park permanently. This area is to be replaced by parkland of comparable size and value on the Hackney side at the end of the 2012 Summer Olympics. It will not be possible to reinstate the loss of mature and varied trees or to compensate for the disruption caused to wildlife by construction.

The natural course of the River Lea forms the borough boundary with Waltham Forest and Newham (except for East Marsh, which lies between the river and Temple Mills). The Olympic plans included upgrading this watercourse and improving public access. The Olympic Park lies south of the A12, on industrial land around the former Hackney Stadium.

==Music, literature and film==

*Alexander Baron wrote a celebrated novel &quot;The Lowlife&quot;, published in 1963. The book takes place primarily in the Hackney area and loosely depicts Baron&#x27;s childhood.
*The celebrated cockney music hall performer Gus Elen sang a song entitled &quot;If It Wasn&#x27;t for the &#x27;Ouses In Between&quot; which included the following chorus:
&quot;Oh it really is a wery pretty gardenAnd Chingford to the eastward could be seen;&#x27;Wiv a ladder and some glasses,You could see to &#x27;Ackney Marshes,If it wasn&#x27;t for the &#x27;ouses in between.&quot;
*An experimental 15-minute film &quot;Hackney Marshes November 4th 1977&quot; by John Smith was shot on the marshes. It was adapted for television the following year.
*In 1997, Nike presented a selection of Premiership players turning out for the Sunday League teams to the soundtrack of Blur&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot;.
*The 2005 film &quot;Bullet Boy&quot; (Saul Dibb) used the marshes and local streets as a location.
*Radio 1&#x27;s Hackney Weekend was held here on the marshes on 23 and 24 June 2012. with acts such as Jay-Z, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, will.i.am, Florence + The Machine, Leona Lewis and Plan B all performing across the two days.

==Education==
==Transport and locale==

===Railway stations===
The area is not well served by public rail transport, although has many bus services. Access to the Olympic Park is served by Stratford.

Lea Bridge station is the closest rail station to the Marshes. It is one stop away from Stratford.

The nearest London Overground station are Hackney Wick and Homerton, which are about a twenty-minute walk away. At about thirty minutes walking time, the nearest London Underground stations are Leyton and Stratford. Stratford International is also a Eurostar and National Rail station. (International trains are not currently stopping here).

===Walking and cycling===
Nearby, Hackney Wick is on the Capital Ring walking route, much of which is accessible to cyclists. The River Lea and local canals have a tow path which is accessible for both walking and cycling. The River Lea provides a continuous route to Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire via the Lea Valley Path for the particularly determined.

Leyton Marsh and the Walthamstow Marshes SSSI are located to the north of Hackney Marshes, and are part of the Lee Valley Regional Park.

<text>Manuel José de Arriaga Brum da Silveira e Peyrelongue (; 8 July 1840 – 5 March 1917) was a Portuguese lawyer, the first attorney-general and the first elected president of the First Portuguese Republic, following the deposition of King Manuel II of Portugal and a Republican Provisional Government headed by Teófilo Braga (who would succeed him in the post following his resignation).

==Biography==
Of his early life details are brief: Arriaga was born to an aristocratic family; son of Sebastião José de Arriaga Brum da Silveira (c. 1810 – Setúbal, 18 October 1881) and his wife, whom he married on 24 December 1834, Maria Cristina Pardal Ramos Caldeira (c. 1815 – ?). Arriaga&#x27;s father was a rich merchant in the city, only son, and property-owner, whose heritage traced his lineage to the Fleming Joss van Aard, one of the original settlers of the island of Faial (of the male line to a Basque family of small nobility) and whose second cousin was Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira. The young Manuel was also the grandson of General Sebastião José de Arriaga Brum da Silveira, who distinguished himself in the Peninsular Wars, and grand-nephew of the Judge of the Supreme Court, who between 1821 and 1822 was also a representative for the Azores in the Constituent Courts.

The Arriaga family included six children, of these the following siblings: Maria Cristina, the oldest (a poet, referred by Vitorino Nemésio in his obra-prima &quot;Mau Tempo no Canal&quot;); José de Arriaga, a historian (known for &quot;História da Revolução Portuguesa de 1820&quot;, published in 1889 and &quot;Os Últimos 60 anos da Monarquia&quot;, published in 1911); Sebastião Arriaga Brum da Silveira Júnior, agricultural engineer (after studying abroad, he worked on land recuperation projects in the Alentejo); and Manuel, the fourth in line of succession (who decided early on to concentrate on politics).

===Education===
Arriaga had his primary education in his native city of Horta. Around the age of 18, he moved with his younger brother (José de Arriaga) to Coimbra to study at the University of Coimbra in the Faculty of Law (from 1860 to 1865), where he distinguished himself for his brilliant mind and notable oratory. During this time he adhered to philosophical positivism and republican democracy, where he frequently joined others is discussions on philosophy and politics, showing a capacity for argument and imagination. His republican idealism, considered subversive, caused a rift between him and his conservative monarchist-leaning father (a supporter of the traditionalist King D. Miguel); his father would break-off ties with his sons (for those subverse ideals), forcing the older Manuel to work as a private teacher to support his and his brother&#x27;s studies.

After finishing his studies in 1865, Manuel worked as a lawyer in Lisbon, but, desiring to be a teacher, he competed for the 10th chair at the &quot;Escola Politécnica&quot; (Polytechnical school) in 1866, as well as the chair in History in the department of Letters. Unsuccessful, in 1875 he ended up working in Lisbon both as an English teacher at the local secondary school, and as a lawyer.

Later, he established a legal practice, and quickly developed a clientele, which permitted him the financial security to assist his brother in completing his studies. Between many of the causes he defended while a lawyer, in 1890, he was the advocate for António José de Almeida, after he wrote &quot;Bragança, o último&quot; an article against King D. Carlos in the academic journal &quot;O Ultimatum&quot;.

On 26 August 1876, he joined the &quot;Comissão para a Reforma da Instrução Secundária&quot; (&quot;Commission on the Reform on Secondary School Instruction&quot;).

===Politics===

A member of the Portuguese Republican Party (before the 31 January 1891 revolt), alongside Jacinto Nunes, Azevedo e Silva, Bernardino Pinheiro, Teófilo Braga and Francisco Homem Cristo, he was an active parliamentarian during the constitutional monarchy of King Luís I; he was involved in the debates on the reform of education, the penal code and prisons, in addition to electoral reform. By this time doctrinaire republicans had, by that time, been replaced by others in the party affiliated with masonry or the nascente Carbonari associations. He was also elected deputy for Funchal (1883–84) in the minority Republican government and later Lisbon (1890–92). A pragmatist, he actively promoted the Republican cause, while maintaining good relations with the Roman Catholic Church, unlike some of his contemporaries in the Republican movement. But, at the same time, he was combative and critical of what he saw as the &quot;lethargy of monarchical governments, the [general] wastes and luxuries of the royal family. Yet, he ardently denounced irregularities in his own government, especially when some Ministers transferred funds from the government coffers into private hands.

Following the establishment of the Republic (5 October 1910), young Republican students in Coimbra entered the installations of the Senate, and vandalized the Hall and furniture used in Doctoral ceremonies and damaged paintings of the last Portuguese kings. In order &quot;to impede other depravities Dr. António José de Almeida (Republican from the first hour) invited Dr. Manuel de Arriaga to be rector of the old University and gave him leave on 17 October of 1910 in a ceremony without academic ceremonies, which was enough to curb student enthusiasm&quot;.

During the period of the Provisional Government, he became the Attorney-General of the Republic premièring in that way as a paladin of Republican propaganda and as one of the more caustic Portuguese.

As one of the older figures of the Republican regime (he was 71), he was elected President on 24 August 1911; he did not campaign for the position, and noted that it was a heavy burden, which he believed he was personally incapable of fulfilling its duties, but accepted it &quot;for the good of the Republic&quot;. The other candidate was Dr. Bernardino Machado (who would also become President later), but it was António José de Almeida who had suggested Manuel de Arriaga at the end of Teófilo Braga&#x27;s Provisional Government. As Almeida had believed Arriaga &quot;was one of the few if not the only man in the Party who worked well with everyone and whom the Lord Christ didn&#x27;t speak ill&quot;.

The Presidency was itself not an enviable or prestigious position; although the elected person, for a time, occupied a large home in Horta Seca, they were required to furnish the home at their own cost, pay rent and had no transport budget, nor personal secretary (Arriaga would ask his own son to help him in this role). Later, the first President lived in the Palace of Belém, but not in the main building, but rather an annex off of the Pátio das Damas. This occurred in a period when personal divisions between different factions had splintered the Republican cause; António José de Almeida would form the Evolutionist Party, Brito Camacho the Republican Union, while Afonso Costa would continue to front the main Republican Party (renamed the Democratic Party). Manuel de Arriaga, for his part, would select the politician and journalist João Chagas to head his first government. In his personal autobiography, Arriaga recounted how he hoped that he would not be another factor to divide Republicans, especially in a time where there existed a need to work together; it was a difficult period historically, due to the exasperation of the &quot;religious question&quot;, constant social agitation and political party instability (associated with &quot;Machiavellian strategies&quot; of some politicians) that fermented during the infancy of the First Republic. Frequently, Arriaga was unable to contain these tensions and often had to deal with counter-revolutionary revolts, such as the Royalist attack on Chaves led by Captain Paiva Couceiro. During his mandate, several governments fell; there were eight changes in the Prime Minister&#x27;s office, disorder in the streets, violent reactions against the church, as well as counter-revolutionary monarchist movements. Finally, he invited Dr. António José de Almeida to lead the government, but he refused, and opted for the Republican Afonso Costa, who would govern off-and-on until 1917. Hated, but feared, he governed and even sought to restore some order and economy to the public accounts. Although Afonso Costa was able to reduce the deficit, the instability and conflict between Parties persisted, made more critical by internal politics and growing international tensions in 1914 (that would eventually begin World War I).

Arriaga deplored the circumstances, going so far as to announcing his intent to resign unless a coalition or non-party government could be installed that resolved the outstanding issues of amnesty and separation of church and state. But, subsequent governments would not resolve the issue immediately; on 22 February 1914 an amnesty was conceded for those not accused of violent actions, and eleven leaders of subversive groups were released, but the Law of Separation remained unrevised.

===Revolt to resignation===
Continuing political intrigues inevitably forced the first Republic down the path towards dictatorship. At the onset of the First World War, there was also pressure from the Portuguese colonies in Africa, principally Angola and Mozambique and the National Assembly had decided, while remaining initially neutral in the conflict, to send troops to those colonies which fronted German possessions.

The new Republic was now increasingly unmanageable, and further, there were divergences developing between the government and the army. At one point, a military contingent in Oporto attempted a coup d&#x27;état in Lisbon, which was suppressed. The government suggested disbanding the regiments involved, but their leaders appealed to General Pimenta de Castro. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, Manuel de Arriaga wrote to the three party leaders (Camacho, Afonso Costa and António José de Almeida) in order to come to an accord and form a unity government, but Afonso Costa did not react well to the proposal. The President then withdrew his support for the government, then-presided by Vítor Hugo de Azevedo, and to calm the Army called on General Joaquim Pimenta de Castro (who had been the Minister of War under João Chagas) to form a government. Arriaga had known and placed his confidence in Castro. But, Joaquim Pereira Pimenta de Castro selected for his ministers, seven military officers, who did not permit the re-opening of Parliament, and provided an amnesty for convicted monarchists involved in the Attack on Chaves He made changes to electoral law and began governing as a dictator, which was only supported by the Evolutionist Party (Portugal) and the group led by Machado dos Santos on the political right of the Republicans.

What had started as an attempt to eliminate an inevitable conflict between the armed forces and the political class, eventually resulted in a bloody conflict. The parliamentarians, meeting secretly on 4 May 1915 in the Palácio da Mitra, declared Arriaga and Pimenta de Castro outside the law, their acts undemocratic and essentially void. Then, on 14 May, in a revolt instigated by members of the Democratic Party, elements of civil reactionary groups and supported by elements of the Navy began what was essentially a civil war; there were many deaths and injuries on both sides. The well-intentioned and pacifist Arriaga had only one option; twelve days following the start of the uprising, he resigned from the Presidency. In his resignation letter, he stated that the deaths during the revolt were needless, that Pimenta de Castro&#x27;s regime was less a dictatorship then earlier governments and that 1914–15 laws had given future governments unusual war powers.

He paid heavily for his political naivety; as the author Raul Brandão noted the man, &quot;although profoundly altruistic and magnanimous, good-natured and honorable&quot;, had rapidly turned into a &quot;political criminal&quot; and accused of duplicity with the dictatorial and violent Pimenta de Castro. In his resignation (to his ministers and Party) he defended himself against these unjust accusations and declared his well-intentioned loyalty to the Republican cause, which he had supported throughout his life (but which had abandoned him disillusioned). The parliamentarian, writer and journalist, Augusto de Castro later recounted a conversation with the former President, shortly before his death (in 1917):
:&quot;The man, an admirable magistrate, with an aristocratic comportment and a romantic look, who once was one of the most handsome boys of his time, had transformed himself, in half-a-dozen months, into an old, curved and pathetic man...Arriaga recounted to me one of his unique pleasures during his exile...his flowers, garden and poetry...in that afternoon, seated in his garden, seated in the warmth of the sun&#x27;s rays, I told the old man my predictions. That politics was not made for idealists nor poets, like him...Arriaga listened silently, forcing a smile respectively. Eventually, tears covered his eyes...And while making small patterns in the carpet with his cane, he told me, with an irony...&#x27;I am a political criminal, my friend&#x27;...I wanted to comfort him, and remembered his sense of pride in popular sentiment and justice, that yet remained in his soul...the people that you had esteemed, continue to respect and love you. That much is true. There are few in the theater, in public, who caricature you...&quot;

But Augusto de Castro ended his story by noting that upon leaving the ex-President&#x27;s home he purchased a newspaper that referred to Arriaga as a renegade and traitor, and thought, &quot;never, like that afternoon, did politics seem so cruel and a sinister thing&quot;.

Manuel de Arriaga was replaced as President by Professor Teófilo Braga in 1915, who had led the provisional government following the abdication and exile of King Manuel II.

===Later life===
In 1874, Arriaga had married Lucrécia Augusta de Brito de Berredo Furtado de Melo (Foz do Douro, Porto, 13 November 1844 – Parede, Oeiras, 14 October 1927), from a family friendly to the Arriagas (from the island of Pico). The ceremony occurred in a chapel near Valença do Minho, where her father was General and Governor. For a few years the couple lived in Coimbra, where Manuel de Arriaga flourished in his law practice. Six children were born, two boys and four girls, and the family regularly spent their holidays in Buarcos.

Following his resignation, Manuel de Arriaga died in Lisbon two years later on 5 March 1917. His home, near Rua da Janelas Verdes, overlooked the boats in the Tejo, and in the room where he died there were photographs of the two men he most admired, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Herculano, while above his bed, an image of Christ. In the end, former-President Arriaga&#x27;s image was rehabilitated by the Portuguese media for his &quot;intelligence, patriotism, benevolence and his honor for the manner in which he exercised his functions&quot;. This was further enhanced by his public papers and documents, as well as the work of several intellectuals.

Arriaga was buried in the Prazeres Cemetery the day after his death. In 2004, by decision of the Assembly of the Republic, his body was moved to the National Pantheon.

<text>Kneiphof (; ; ) was a quarter of central Königsberg (Kaliningrad). During the Middle Ages it was one of the three towns that composed the city of Königsberg, the others being Altstadt and Löbenicht. The town was located on a 10-hectare (25-acre) island of the same name in the Pregel River and included Königsberg Cathedral and the original campus of the University of Königsberg. Its territory is now part of the Moskovsky District of Kaliningrad, Russia.

==Etymology==

Medieval variations of Kneiphof included &quot;Knipaw&quot;, &quot;Knipab&quot;, and &quot;Knypabe&quot;. The name was of Old Prussian origin, referring to a swampy land or area flushed by water; the island was bounded to the north by the &quot; Neue Pregel&quot; and to the south by the &quot;Alte Pregel&quot; (or &quot;Natangische Pregel&quot;), branches of the Pregel River. At the start of the 14th century the island was known in German as &quot;Vogtswerder&quot; (Vogt&#x27;s ait), because it was used by a vogt of the Teutonic Knights. The name &quot;Pregelmünde&quot; (mouth of the Pregel) was encouraged in 1333, but the German townspeople instead used the Prussian name used in the 1327 charter. A town seal from 1383 and a 15th-century signet name the town as &quot;nova civitas&quot;, or new town, but this designation was not used in documents.

==History==

===Foundation===

Founded within the state of the Teutonic Order, Kneiphof was the youngest of Königsberg&#x27;s three towns, each of which had its own charter, market rights, church, and fortifications. Settlement by merchants was intensified in 1324 with construction along the Langgasse and the bridges Krämerbrücke and Grüne Brücke. It was granted Kulm rights on 6 April 1327 by Grand Master Werner von Orseln. The new town of Kneiphof encompassed two-thirds of the island; in the same year Orseln granted the eastern third of the island to the Bishopric of Samland to allow construction of Königsberg Cathedral, which occurred from ca. 1330–80. Kneiphof&#x27;s coat of arms depicted a blue-clad arm extending from waves and holding a crown, flanked by two golden hunting horns in a green field.

Along with the island, the town of Kneiphof also had jurisdiction over the &quot;Freiheiten&quot; Vorstadt and village Haberberg in Natangia. Haberberg and Alter Garten were granted to Kneiphof by Grand Master Albert for services rendered during the Horsemen&#x27;s War. Kneiphof&#x27;s warehouses were built in Vordere Vorstadt. Other places controlled by Kneiphof included the village Schönfliess, the estates Fischhof and Anker along the Pregel, Rosenau, and the tile factory in Genslack near Ottenhagen.

Bridges connecting Kneiphof to Altstadt were the Krämerbrücke (built 1286), the Dombrücke (built ca. 1330, destroyed 1379), and the Schmiedebrücke (built 1379). The Honigbrücke (built 1542) connected Kneiphof to Lomse, while the town was connected with Vorstadt by the Grüne Brücke (built 1322) and the Köttelbrücke (built 1377). These are five of the bridges in the seven bridges of Königsberg mathematics problem. Euler&#x27;s proof that no solution is possible provides the foundations for graph theory and the application of topolgical understanding to exploring real-world questions.

As a member of the Hanseatic League, Kneiphof took part in the Confederation of Cologne against King Valdemar IV of Denmark in 1367.

===Thirteen Years&#x27; War===
In February 1440, representatives of both Altstadt and Kneiphof took part in a convention in Elbląg, at which a decision was made to establish the Prussian Confederation. Both were founding members of the Confederation in March 1440, while Löbenicht was not. In 1454, the Confederation asked Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon to incorporate the region into the Kingdom of Poland, to which the King agreed and signed the act of incorporation in Kraków, and the towns rebelled against the Teutonic Knights at the beginning of the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War and recognized the Polish King as rightful ruler. The rebellion in Königsberg was supported by the merchant class and led by Altstadt&#x27;s Bürgermeister, Andreas Brunau. Based upon the example of Danzig (Gdańsk), Brunau hoped to turn Königsberg into an autonomous city within Poland with control over all Samland. On 19 June Kneiphof&#x27;s Bürgermeister, Jürgen Langerbein of Stralsund, paid fealty to the Polish chancellor, Jan Taszka Koniecpolski.

Brunau lost the support of Altstadt and Löbenicht on 24 March 1455 due to spontaneous opposition from craftsmen and workers, with the rebels retreating to Kneiphof. The workers in Kneiphof were too weak to defeat Brunau&#x27;s rebels. Komtur Heinrich Reuß von Plauen, supported by Old Prussian freemen bringing 300 horses, approached the city on 15 April, with Altstadt and Löbenicht paying homage in the following days. Kneiphof remained in rebellion, however, protected by water and walls. Langerbein&#x27;s forces consisted of 1,000 men, including 400 from Danzig. Plauen had the support of Altstadt, Löbenicht, 300 Sambian freemen, and soldiers led by Silesian and Saxon nobility, including Balthasar of Żagań, Hans and Adolf von Gleichen, Johann von Wartenburg, and Botho von Eulenburg.

Plauen led an unsuccessful attack on Kneiphof from Haberberg on 13 April, followed by indecisive fighting between Kneiphof and Altstadt from 18 to 19 April. After nine ships from Danzig arrived to aid Kneiphof, Plauen&#x27;s forces took two bridges and protected them with blockhouses to prevent further reinforcements. When another fifteen ships arrived the Danzigers were able to recapture one bridge, but took heavy losses trying for the second and retreated after four days of fighting. Plauen resisted sorties from Kneiphof and his forces steadily grew in number; the Landmeister of Livonia provided 500 troops and King Christian I of Denmark sent a ship. The rebels in Kneiphof surrendered out of hunger to Plauen on 14 July, with soldiers and citizenry receiving amnesty. Kneiphof remained distrustful of Plauen and the Teutonic Knights, but resented the lack of Polish assistance. Kneiphof continued to conspire with Danzig against the Knights, leading Plauen to replace the entire town council and eleven burghers. In 1455 Plauen reaffirmed Kneiphof&#x27;s town rights. The war ended in 1466 with a peace treaty, according to which the town became a part of Poland as a fief held by the Teutonic Knights.

===Modern era===

Kneiphof became part of the Duchy of Prussia when the Teutonic Order&#x27;s Prussian branch was secularized in 1525, and remained a fief of Poland. The University of Königsberg, the Albertina, was founded just east of the cathedral in 1544. A new campus, the &quot;Neue Universität&quot; at the Paradeplatz north of Altstadt, was dedicated in 1861 as its replacement.

Kneiphof became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701. In the same year the three towns resisted the efforts of Burgfreiheit to form a proposed fourth town, Friedrichsstadt. By the &quot;Rathäusliche Reglement&quot; of 13 June 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia merged Altstadt, Löbenicht, Kneiphof, and their respective suburbs into the united city of Königsberg. Königsberg Castle and its suburbs remained separate until the &quot;Städteordnung&quot; of Stein on 19 November 1808 during the era of Prussian reforms.

===Kaliningrad===

Kneiphof was devastated by the 1944 bombing of Königsberg in World War II. Conquered by the Soviet Union in 1945, Königsberg was renamed to Kaliningrad in 1946. Material from former Kneiphof&#x27;s buildings was used for the reconstruction of cities such as Leningrad. In the 1970s the island began to be converted into a park with numerous sculptures. Reconstruction of the cathedral commenced in the 1990s. Former Kneiphof is now known as Kant Island (), in honor of the philosopher Immanuel Kant.

==Locations==

Königsberg Cathedral rose high above the island town. Kneiphof Town Hall served as city hall for all of Königsberg from 1724 until 1927, when the administration moved to the Stadthaus. The island&#x27;s secondary school, Kneiphof Gymnasium, was located north of the cathedral and later hosted the combined Stadtgymnasium Altstadt-Kneiphof. Königsberg&#x27;s municipal library and archive were located in the original campus of the university.

Kneiphöfische Langgasse was one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city. Banks with locations along the street in the 20th century included Dresdner Bank, Commerzbank, Landesbank der Provinz Ostpreußen, Stadtsparkasse, and Ostbank für Handel und Gewerbe.

<text>Luis Guzmán (born August 28, 1956) is a Puerto Rican actor. His career spans over 40 years and includes a number of films and television series. He has appeared in Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s films &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; (1997), &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999) and &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot; (2002), and Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s films &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998), &quot;The Limey&quot; (1999) and &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000). His other film credits include &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; (1990), &quot;The Hard Way&quot; (1991), &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot; (1993), and &quot;Keanu&quot; (2016). For his role in &quot;The Limey&quot;, he received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.

On television, he starred as Raoul Hernandez on the HBO prison drama &quot;Oz&quot; (1998–2000), José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha on &quot;Narcos&quot; (2015), Jesse &quot;Mama&quot; Salander on the CBS medical drama &quot;Code Black&quot; (2015–2018), Hector Contreras on &quot;Perpetual Grace, LTD&quot; (2019), and Gomez Addams on &quot;Wednesday&quot; (2022–present).

==Early life==
Guzmán was born in Cayey, Puerto Rico, and was raised in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village and the surrounding Lower East Side neighborhood. He went to Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side. His mother, Rosa, was a hospital worker, and his stepfather, Benjamin Cardona, was a TV repairman. Guzmán graduated from American University, and shortly after began his career as a social worker and moonlighted as an actor, eventually becoming heavily involved in street theater and independent films.

==Career==
Guzman&#x27;s numerous movie credits include &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way&quot;, &quot;Carlito&#x27;s Way: Rise to Power&quot;, &quot;Punch-Drunk Love&quot;, &quot;Welcome to Collinwood,&quot; &quot;Stonewall&quot;, &quot;Waiting...&quot;, &quot;The Salton Sea&quot;, and &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. He has also appeared on the TV shows &quot;&quot;, &quot;Frasier, Community&quot; (as himself) and &quot;Oz&quot; and voiced Ricardo Diaz in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and its prequel &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;. Guzmán starred in the short-lived 2003 television comedy &quot;Luis&quot;, and is a commentator on VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s,&quot; as well as &quot;I Love Toys&quot; and its sequels, including &quot;I Love the &#x27;70s&quot; and &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s&quot;. He co-starred on the 2007 HBO series &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot;, which lasted one season.

In early 2008, Guzmán starred in &quot;&quot;Naturally Aged&quot; Cheddar Hunks&quot; TV ads for Cabot Creamery. He also appeared in the music video &quot;Yes We Can.&quot; In 2010, he starred in HBO&#x27;s &quot;How to Make It in America&quot; and appeared in a comical series of Snickers commercials that played during that year&#x27;s Super Bowl.

==Personal life==
Guzmán resides in Cabot, Vermont.

Guzmán endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In 2018, Guzmán, along with New York Yankees all-star Bernie Williams, appeared in a season six episode of Jon Taffer&#x27;s &quot;Bar Rescue&quot;, offering assistance not only to the El Krajo Tavern in Loiza, but the town&#x27;s community center, after it was devastated from Hurricane Maria. 

During Telegramgate, Guzmán was interviewed by MSNBC for his opinions on the situation in Puerto Rico and he expressed that &quot;Ricky had to go&quot; and that corruption on the island was a major problem that he hoped would be solved.

<doc id="669600" wikidata="Q140420" url="?curid=669600" title="Rusyns">
<text>Rusyns (), also known as Carpatho-Rusyns (), Ruthenians, or Rusnaks (), are an East Slavic ethnic group from the Eastern Carpathians in Central Europe. They speak Rusyn, an East Slavic language variety, treated variously as either a distinct language or a dialect of the Ukrainian language. As traditional adherents of Eastern Christianity, the majority of Rusyns are Eastern Catholics, though a minority of Rusyns practice Eastern Orthodoxy. Rusyns primarily self-identify as a distinct Slavic people and they are recognized as such in Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia, where they have official minority status. Alternatively, some identify more closely with their country of residence (i.e. Polish, Slovak), while others are a branch of the Ukrainian people.

Rusyns are descended from an East Slavic population which inhabited the northeastern regions of the Eastern Carpathians. In those regions, there are several Rusyn groups, including Dolinyans, Boykos, Hutsuls and Lemkos.

Of the estimated 1.7 million people of Rusyn origin, only around 110,000 have been officially identified as such in recent ( 2012) national censuses. This is largely because some census-taking authorities classify them as a subgroup of the Ukrainian people, while others classify them as a distinct ethnic group.

== Ethnonyms ==
The term Rusyn (, plural ) originates from the archaic ethnonym &quot;&quot;Rus&quot;″&quot;. The respective endonymic adjective has traditionally been ( m., f., n.), though () has also been used; even more so after 1989.

In interwar Czechoslovakia, &quot;Ruthenia&quot; was called in Czech; sometimes rendered &quot;Rusinia&quot; or &quot;Rusynia&quot; in American-Rusyn publications.

=== Regional identifiers ===
Carpatho-Rusyn or &quot;Carpatho-Ruthenian&quot; () is the main regional designation for Rusyns. The term refers to Carpathian Ruthenia (), which is a historical cross-border region encompassing Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (in northeastern Slovakia and Ukraine&#x27;s Zakarpattia Oblast), Prešov Region (in eastern Slovakia), the Lemko Region (in southeastern Poland), and Maramureş (in north-central Romania). In the Lemko region, the endonym &quot;Lemko&quot; (pl. ) became more common in the twentieth century, along with &quot;Lemko-Rusyn&quot; since the 1990s.

The variant Rusnak (; plural: or Pannonian-Rusyn, &quot;Rusnatsi&quot;) was also (and still is) used as an endonym; particularly by Rusyns outside the Carpathians in Vojvodina, Serbia and Slavonia, Croatia. However, they may also referred to as &quot;Vojvodinian Rusyns&quot; (), &quot;Bachka-Srem Rusyns&quot; (), or formerly as &quot;Yugoslav Rusyns&quot; ().

Other terms such as Ruthene, Rusniak, Lemak, Lyshak, and Lemko are considered by some scholars to be historic, local, or synonymic names for these inhabitants of Transcarpathia. Others hold that the terms Lemko and Rusnak are simply regional variations for Rusyns or Ruthenes.

Rusyns have at times also been referred to as &quot;Uhro-Rusyn&quot; () in the regions of Prešov, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia.

=== Rus&#x27; ===

Several endonyms such as Rus&#x27; and Rusyn were used widely by the East Slavs of Kievan Rus&#x27; during the medieval period. Common endonymic use of those terms continued through the life of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Parallel, medieval Latin terms such as &quot;Rusi&quot;, &quot;Russi&quot; or &quot;Rusci&quot; are found in sources of the period and were commonly used as an exonym for the East Slavs.

=== Ruthenian ===

Since the end of the 11th century, the exonymic term Rutheni (Ruthenes) was also used by some Latin sources of western provenance as an alternative term for all East Slavs. During the rule of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the scope of &quot;Rutheni&quot; gradually narrowed to only refer to inhabitants of the East Slavic regions that now mostly belong to the states of Belarus and Ukraine.

After the Partitions of Poland, &quot;Rutheni&quot; &quot;came to be associated primarily with those [East Slavs] who lived under the Habsburg monarchy&quot; (and was used as an official designation in the Austrian Empire after 1843). In the Kingdom of Hungary, &quot;Ruthene&quot; was used as the official term for the Rusyn people () of Transcarpathia until 1945. During the early twentieth century the term &quot;became even more restricted: it was generally used to refer to the inhabitants of Transcarpathia and to Transcarpathian emigrants in the United States&quot;, for whom the terms Rusyn and Carpatho-Rusyn are more commonly used since the 1970s.

In some non-Slavic languages, Rusyns may be referred to by exonymic or somewhat archaic terms such as &quot;Carpatho-Ruthenes&quot; or &quot;Carpatho-Ruthenians&quot;, but such terminology is not present in the Rusyn language. Exonymic &quot;Ruthenian&quot; designations are seen as less precise because they encompass various East Slavic groups and bear broader ethnic connotations as a result of varied historical usage.

=== Carpatho-Russian ===
In older literature and speech, both Catholic and Orthodox Rusyns occasionally referred to themselves as Carpatho-Russians or &quot;Carpathian Russians.&quot; These terms, however, are generally considered antiquated and now typically refer to ethnic Russians of the Carpathian region. The use of several, imprecise &quot;Russian&quot; ethnonyms (in a Rusyn context) are also present in the works of some older authors, including foreign authors, as well as those native to the region. This terminology has also been reflected within some groups of the Rusyn diaspora. For example, the popular newspaper of the Byzantine (Greek) Catholic Church in the U.S. for decades known as the ‘Greek Catholic Union Messenger’, used the term Carpatho-Russian up until the 1950s (by the 1960s the term Ruthenian came into vogue). As well, the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, with over 14,000 members and 78 parishes as of 2006 (and founded by former Byzantine Catholic members), uses the term Carpatho-Russian on a regular basis even today. Finally, as of the early 21st Century, one can still hear Rusyn Americans within the OCA and ROCOR Orthodox churches self-identify as Carpatho-Russian.

=== Origins ===
There are different theories to explain Rusyn origins. According to Paul Robert Magocsi, the origin of the present-day Carpatho-Rusyns is complex and not exclusively related to the Kievan Rus&#x27;. The ancestors were the early Slavs whose movement to the Danubian Basin was influenced by the Huns and Pannonian Avars between the 5th and 6th centuries, the White Croats who lived on both slopes of the Carpathians and built many hill-forts in the region including Uzhhorod ruled by the mythical ruler Laborec, the Rusyns of Galicia and Podolia, and Vlach shepherds of Transylvania. It is thought that the Croats were part of the Antes tribal polity who migrated to Galicia in the 3rd-4th century, under pressure by invading Huns and Goths. George Shevelov also considered a connection with East Slavic tribes, more specifically, the Hutsuls, and possibly Boykos, argued to be the descendants of the Ulichs who were not native in the region. As the region of the Ukrainian Carpathians, including Zakarpattia and Prykarpattia, has since the Early Middle Ages been inhabited by the tribes of Croats, in Ukrainian encyclopedias and dictionaries, and the &quot;Great Russian Encyclopedia&quot;, the Rusyns are generally considered to be the descendants of the White Croats.

==== Anthropology ====
According to anthropological studies, the Eastern Carpathian population makes one of the sub-regional clines of the Ukrainian population, which can be regionally divided into Eastern and Western Carpathian variants. In the study by M. S. Velikanova (1975) the skulls from a medieval necropolis near village of Vasyliv in Zastavna Raion were very similar to contemporary Carpathian population, and according to S. P. Segeda, V. Dyachenko and T. I. Alekseyeva this anthropological complex developed in the Middle Ages or earlier, as descendants of the medieval Slavs of Galicia and carriers of Chernyakhov culture along Prut-Dniester rivers, possibly with some Thracian component. According to the data, the population has the lowest admixture in Ukraine of Turkic speaking populations, like Volga Tatars and Bashkirs, while in comparison to other populations they have similarities with neighbouring Eastern Slovaks, Gorals of Poland, Romanians, some groups of Czechs and Hungarians, Northwestern Bulgarians, Central and Northern Serbians, and most of Croatians.

==== Population genetics ====
The 2006 mitochondrial DNA study of Carpathian Highlanders – Boykos, Hutsuls and Lemkos people – showed a common ancestry with other modern Europeans. A 2009 mitochondrial DNA study of 111 samples found that in comparison to eight other Central and Eastern European populations (Belarusian, Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian), the three Rusyn groups have a greater distance between themselves than these populations, with Boykos showing the greatest distance from all and did not cluster with anyone because have atypically low frequencies of haplogroup H (20%) and J (5%) for a European population, while Lemkos are closest to the Czech and Romanian (0.17) population, and Hutsuls closest to the Croatian (0.11) and Ukrainian (0.16) population.

The 2014 Y-DNA studies of 200 Pannonian Rusyns in the region of Vojvodina, Serbia, found they mostly belong to haplogroup R1a (43%), I2 (20%), E-V13 (12.5%), and R1b (8.5%), while I1, G2a, J2b, N1 between 2.5 and 4.5%, and J1, T, and H only in traces of less than 1%. They cluster closest to the Ukrainian and Slovakian population, &quot;providing evidence for their genetic isolation from the Serbian majority population&quot;. The 2015 Y-DNA study of 150 men from Zakarpattia and Chernivtsi Oblast (Bukovina), found they mostly belong to R1a1a1*(М198), I2a (Р37.2), R1a1a1 (М458) ranging around and less than 30%, with E1b1b1a1 (M78), R1b1b2 (M269), and I1 (М253) ranging between 4-14%. The sampled population is most similar to other Ukrainians, while the Bukovina population slightly &quot;differs from the typical Ukrainian population&quot; because it has the highest percentage of I2a (&gt;30%) and the lowest percentage of R1a (30%) in Ukraine. Bukovina&#x27;s percentage of I2 is similar to near Moldovan and Romanian population, while the highest percentage is among South Slavs in Western Balkans. It was concluded that although bordered by diverse nations, the Carpathians seemingly were a barrier decreasing gene flow southward of N1c (М178), R1a (М198) from the region, and northward of E1b (М78), R1b (М269), J (М304) and G (М201) to the region.

=== Early history ===

The general usage of &#x27;Rusyn&#x27; by all East Slavs dates back to over 11 centuries, its origin signifying the ethnic tie to the political entity of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which existed from the late ninth to the early 13th century. The Carpathian Rusyns, Ukrainians (once called Ruthenians or Little Russians), Belarusians (once called White Russians) and Russians (Great Russians) are descendants of the Russichi, the people of Rus&#x27;, that is East Slavs who mixed with other peoples over centuries, including in the south with Iranian and later with Germanic peoples, in the west with Baltic peoples, in the east with Finnish and Turkic peoples.

Over the centuries these loosely affiliated peoples developed different political and economic centers as well as new names. The inhabitants of northern Rus&#x27; were known as Great Russians by the 17th century. The people in the west called themselves Belarusians and the people in the south were known as Malorussians (Little Russians). Later, in what began as a political movement in the mid 19th century, many Little Russians began using the term &quot;Ukrainian&quot; to distinguish themselves from the Great Russians in northern Rus&#x27;. So by the mid-20th century the original name Rus or Rusyn was retained only in the Carpathian Mountains.

Rusyns settled in the Carpathian Mountain region in various waves of immigration from the north between the eighth and 17th centuries. Weapons and skeletons found in tombs in Bereg County from the 10th century era suggest that Norman Vikings (who played a role in the founding of Kiev Rus&#x27;) were there as well. Even so, as late as the 11th century, this mountainous area was still a sparsely inhabited &#x27;No-Man&#x27;s Land&#x27; border between the kingdoms of Kievan Rus&#x27; and Hungary.

In 1241, the Carpathians fell to Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan&#x27;s grandson, Batu Khan, with populations exterminated and villages torched. The Mongols entered the region via the Veretski Pass, just to the north of Mukachevo.

In 1395, Orthodox Rus&#x27; Prince Feodor Koriatovich, son of the Duke of Novgorod, brought with him from the north soldiers and their families to settle unpopulated Carpathian lands. While the actual number of immigrants is uncertain, the arrival of Koriatovich and his retinue was a milestone for the Rusyns, substantially improving the region&#x27;s administrative, ecclesiastical and cultural aspects. This included building and fortifying Mukachevo Castle with cannons, a moat, workers and artisans, and the founding of an Orthodox monastery on the Latorytsia River.

=== Modern history ===
The Austro-Hungarian monarchy controlled the Carpathians from 1772 to 1918. With the increased Magyarization in the nineteenth century, for some educated and intellectual Rusyns it was natural to move to Budapest, while for other Slavic minded intellectuals the Russian Empire became a favored destination.

The Rusyns have always been subject to larger neighboring powers, but in the 19th century a Rusyn national movement was formed which emphasized distinct ethnic identity and literary language. During the Spring of Nations on 2 May 1848 in Lemberg (today Lviv) was established the first political representation of the Galician Rusyns, the Main Ruthenian Council (, &quot;Holovna Ruska Rada&quot;). The most active and leading stratum among Rusyns was Greek-Catholic clergy (see Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo, Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, a successor of Ecclesia Ruthena unita).

The nineteenth century also saw the spread of pan Slavism in Europe, and a pro-Moscow view became popular. The Russian military campaign of Tsar Nicholas I through the Carpathians in 1849 had significance for the local Rusyn population, who came into close contact with an almost 200,000 man Russian army. This interaction had an impact on the rising national consciousness of that time. Aleksander Dukhnovich (1803–1865), who wrote the unofficial Rusyn National Anthem (&quot;I was, am, and will be a Rusyn&quot;), and who by some is considered to be a sort of &#x27;George Washington&#x27; of the Rusyns, reminisced that when he saw the Russian Cossacks on the streets, he &quot;danced and cried with joy&quot;.

A few decades later, when economic conditions and repression worsened in the late 19th century, massive emigration of Rusyns to America took place, beginning in the early 1870s. Between 1899 and 1931, Ellis Island listed 268,669 Rusyn immigrants. Most settled in the northeastern states, but Rusyn settlements also appeared in more far flung states such as Minnesota, Colorado, Alabama, Washington and Montana. Smaller numbers also emigrated to Canada, Brazil and Argentina.
Rusyns formed two ephemeral states after World War I: the Lemko-Rusyn Republic and Komancza Republic. Prior to this time, some of the founders of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic were sentenced to death or imprisoned in Talerhof by the prosecuting attorney Kost Levytsky (), future president of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. In the interwar period, the Rusyn diaspora in Czechoslovakia enjoyed liberal conditions to develop their culture (in comparison with Ukrainians in Poland or Romania). Hutsul Stepan Klochurak was a prime minister of Hutsul Republic centered in Yasinia that was seeking union with the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, but was overran by the Hungarian troops, later Klochurak became a Defense Minister of Carpatho-Ukraine.

After World War I, the majority of Rusyns found themselves in the new country of Czechoslovakia. The interwar period became a mini renaissance for Rusyn culture, as they were permitted their own schools, theater, anthem, and even their own governor.
During the Dissolution of Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (1918), various parts of Rusyn people were faced with different political challenges. Those who lived in northeastern counties of the Hungarian part of the former Monarchy were faced with pretensions of Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. On the other hand, those who lived in the former Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria were faced with pretensions of Poland and Ukraine.
In the 1920s and 1930s a dispute existed between Russophile and Ukrainophile Rusyns. In October 1938, a series of political reforms were initiated, leading to the creation of the Second Czechoslovak Republic, consisting of three autonomous political entities, one of them being the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27; (). On 11 October 1938, first autonomous Government of Subcarpathian Rus was appointed, headed by prime-minister Andrej Bródy. Soon after, a crisis occurred between pro-Rusyn and pro-Ukrainian fractions, leading to the fall of Bródy government on 26 October. New regional government, headed by Avgustyn Voloshyn, adopted a pro-Ukrainian course and opted for the change of name, from &quot;Subcarpathian Rus&quot;&#x27; to &quot;Carpathian Ukraine&quot;.
That move led to the creation of a particular terminological duality. On 22 November 1938, authorities of the Second Czechoslovak Republic proclaimed the &quot;Constitutional Law on the Autonomy of Subcarpathian Rus&quot;&#x27; (), officially reaffirming the right of self-determination of Rusyn people (preamble), and confirming full political and administrative autonomy of Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, with its own assembly and government. In the constitutional system of the Second Czechoslovak Republic, the region continued to be known as the Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;, while local institutions promoted the use of the term &quot;Carpathian Ukraine&quot;.
The Republic of Carpatho-Ukraine, which existed for one day on March 15, 1939, before it was occupied and annexed by Hungary, is sometimes considered to have been a self-determining Rusyn state that had intentions to unite with Kiev. The Republic&#x27;s president, Avgustyn Voloshyn, was an advocate of writing in Rusyn. The Hungarian annexation caused support for Russophile direction, while in Germany occupied Poland support for Ukrainian identity.

Although the Carpathians were not a major WWII battlefield, the Rusyns saw their share of horror and destruction, beginning with the Hungarian government&#x27;s 1941 deportation of the Carpathian Jews. In September 1944, while retreating from a Soviet Red Army offensive, the Nazis who were passing through blew up all the bridges in Uzhhorod, including one built in the 14th century.

On 26 November 1944 in Mukachevo representatives from all cities and villages of the land adopted the manifesto uniting Zakarpattia Ukraine with Soviet Ukraine.

The Soviets occupied the Carpathians, and in 1945 the Rusyn ethnic homeland was split among three countries, as western portions were incorporated into Czechoslovakia and Poland, while the eastern portion became part of the Soviet Union and was officially named Transcarpathia. After World War II, Transcarpathia was declared as a part of Ukrainia.

In Poland, the new Communist government deported many Rusyns from their ancestral region, sending many east to Ukraine, and others to the far west of the country. In Czechoslovakia a policy of Ukrainization was implemented. In Ukraine, many Rusyns who owned land or livestock, often funded via their own family members in America, were now branded by the Soviets as kulaks, or rich peasants. Property and farm animals were confiscated and newly established kolkhozes (collectivized farms) were built, with people being forced to work on their own former land, &#x27;employed&#x27; by the Communist government. Some of the less lucky were sent to Siberia.

In 1947, under the Operation Vistula happened forced resettlement of c. 150,000 Lemkos, Boykos and other Ukrainians between Poland and Ukraine. In the same time some 8,500 Rusyns voluntarily emigrated from Czechoslovakia to Ukraine, but more than half of them returned during the 1960s.
These acts were protested for years, but to no avail. In the US, the Greek Catholic Union&#x27;s 1964 convention even adopted a resolution calling on the United Nations to act &quot;so that Carpatho-Russia be recognized and accepted into the free nations of the world as an autonomous state&quot;.

In former Yugoslavia, Rusyns were officially recognized as a distinct national minority, and their legal status was regulated in Yugoslav federal units of Serbia and Croatia. In the Constitution of Serbia, that was adopted in 1963, Rusyns were designated as one of seven (explicitly named) national minorities (Article 82), and the same provision was implemented in the Statute of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina that was adopted in the same year (Article 32). Further on, the Constitutional Law of 1969 regulated the position of Rusyn language as one of five official languages in Vojvodina (Article 67).

=== Recent history ===
After the fall of communism, new opportunities arose for Rusyns in Poland and in the newly formed countries of Slovakia and Ukraine. The Rusyns of the Transcarpathia region of Ukraine were able to vote in December 1991 for self-rule. With an 89% voter turnout, 78% voted Yes to autonomy. But with the Russian majority in the Odesa region casting a similar vote, the Ukrainian government, fearing secession, has refused to honor this referendum.

In terms of minority rights, the question of Rusyn self-identification and recognition in Ukraine has been a subject of interest for European institutions, as well as the United Nations. Nationally, Rusyns are considered (by both state and cultural authorities) only a sub-group of the Ukrainian people. In spite of this, Ukraine&#x27;s Zakarpattia Oblast has recognized Rusyns as a &quot;distinct nationality&quot; within the oblast since a 2007 proclamation by its regional assembly.
By the end of the 20th century there appeared many societies and organizations considering Rusyns as people separate from Ukrainians. By the early 21st century they had representatives in parliaments of Serbia, Hungary, and Romania, published their own press, and in 2007 the Museum of Ruthenian Culture was opened in Prešov, Slovakia.

In 2010 in Mukachevo were festivities commemorating the union of Zakarpattia with Ukraine, four out of 663 of congress delegates who adopted the Manifest about the Union and who were still alive attended the event: F. Sabov, O. Lohoida, M. Moldavchuk and J. Matlakh. They shared their experience about first years of the People&#x27;s Council in revival of the region.

There is also ongoing linguistic and political controversy as to whether Rusyn is a distinct Slavic language or one of several dialects of the Ukrainian language. In several countries, it is recognized as a distinct minority language. Though Ukraine also adopted a law that recognized Rusyn as one of several minority and regional languages in 2012, that law was revoked in 2014.

In 2021 while discussing the borders of modern Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin specifically referred to the people in the Carpathian Mountains of modern-day Ukraine as Rusyns, rather than Ukrainians. In writing about the Soviet Union&#x27;s post World War II takeover of the Transcarpathian region, Putin stated that, &quot;quote, &#x27;Rusyns (Русины) made up a considerable share of the local population&#x27;, unquote&quot;. Then, using the pre-World War II term to describe the region, he asserted that the population of &quot;Subcarpathian Rus&quot;, also known as Podkarpatska Rus (Подкарпатскa Рус) voted to join the Soviet Union either as &quot;either part of the Russian Soviet republic or as a separate Carpathian republic&quot;. Putin noted however that the Soviet authorities &quot;ignored the choice of the people&quot; and incorporated it instead into the Ukrainian Soviet republic.

Today there are estimated to be approximately 1.5 million Rusyns in Europe and a healthy pro-Rusyn movement exists in the Carpathians. Some Ukrainian nationalists have argued that the modern &#x27;Rusyn movement&#x27; is in service of the expansionist aims of modern Russia.

== Autonomist and separatist movements ==
According to Mrs Jozsefne Csepanyi-Bardos, the president of the Ruthenian Ethnic Minority Council in Budapest Capital. The flag of the Ruthenians of the World and the Ruthenian Ethnic Minority Council is a tricolour in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Ukrainian academician, doctor of historical sciences, head of department of National Minorities of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Institute of Political and Ethno-national research, May Panchuk explained that soon after dissolution of the Soviet Union and during the 1991 Ukrainian referendum, there was provided additional question for Zakarpattia residents only whether they wish to obtain a self-governed territory within Ukraine. It triggered Rusyns to create their own political parties and movements. Already in March 1992 the recently created &quot;Subcarpathian republican party&quot; published its program with first elements of separatism: create independent, neutral &quot;Republic Subcarpathian Ruthenia&quot; just as Switzerland; receive full political and economic independence; recognize Rusyn people as a full-scale nationality among other nations. The party contained a well expressed Kremlin orientation and did not hide its connections with pro-Russians elements. In 1993 in Bratislava there was presented the &quot;government of Subcarpathian Ruthenia&quot; with an emphasized change – as &quot;separate subject of the Commonwealth of Independent States&quot;. The activity of the &quot;government&quot; was openly supported by &quot;Russkiy dom&quot;, &quot;Russkiy Mir Foundation&quot;, Association of Zakarpattia democrats, and other pro-Russian organizations. In December 1994 so called &quot;minister of foreign affairs&quot; T. Ondyk appealed to the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin to cancel the 1945 treaty between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia about Zakarpattia Ukraine. At that same time, Ondyk appealed to the presidents of the United States and Hungary accusing the Ukrainian government in the policy of extermination of Rusyns and Hungarians.

A considerable controversy has arisen regarding the Rusyn separatist movement led by the Orthodox priest Dimitry Sydor (now Archbishop of Uzhhorod, in the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)), his relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church and funding for his activities. Russia has, as a result of the Russian census of 2002, recognized the Rusyns as a separate ethnic group in 2004, and has been accused by the Ukrainian government of fueling ethnic tensions and separatism among Rusyns and Ukrainians.

A criminal case under Part 2, Art. 110 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code was initiated after the 1st European Congress of Rusyns took place in Mukachevo on June 7, 2008. At that particular congress the reinstatement of the Zakarpattia&#x27;s status as special &quot;territory of Rusyns to the south of the Carpathians&quot; with self-government under the constitutional name Subcarpathian Rus was recognized. On October 29, at the 2nd congress in Mukachevo, a memorandum was signed calling for the authorities to recognize the Subcarpathian Rus autonomy (by December 1). That same day, according to the &quot;Kommersant-Ukraine&quot; (Ukrainian edition) agents of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) questioned Dmytro Sydor and Yevgeniy Zhupan. They were summoned to SBU as witnesses in a criminal case &quot;on the infringement on territorial integrity of Ukraine&quot; initiated in June 2008. According to internet publisher &quot;Newsru&quot;, earlier in 2008 the Zakarpattia Rusyns appealed to Russia to recognize independence of Subcarpathian Ruthenia from Ukraine. In 2014 with the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War, an activist of the Subcarpathian Ruthenia movement named Petro Hetsko, who claims to be prime minister of the Subcarpathian Ruthenia, asked the President of Russia to intervene and help &quot;neutralize Galician Nazism in Zakarpattia&quot;.

Research conducted by the University of Cambridge during the height of political Rusynism in the mid-1990s that focused on five specific regions within the Zakarpattia Oblast having the strongest pro-Rusyn cultural and political activism, found that only nine percent of the population of these areas claimed Rusyn ethnicity. In the present day, according to the Ukrainian census, most – over 99% – of the local inhabitants consider themselves to be Ukrainians. (Ukrainian census numbers inflated since 1991 refer to local ones for accuracy).

==Religion ==
=== Early history ===
Religion and Rusyn history are deeply intertwined, often resulting in controversy. Many believe that when Rusyns first came to Christianity it was through the Orthodox faith, although this has been challenged by many others who assert the initial Christian influence actually came from Catholic Moravia. One of the earliest saints of the (Orthodox) Monastery of the Caves at Kiev was the Rusyn Moses Uhrin (died 1043), who prior to becoming a monk served Boris, the prince of Ancient Rus&#x27;. Moses and his brothers Efrem and Georgii stories are recorded in the noted &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;. Also originating from this time is the unique Carpathian church Prostopinije (Plain Chant), which is closely related to the ancient chant of Kievan Rus&#x27; and has even preserved elements of it.

For over 600 years, the Orthodox Church was the only Rusyn church in the Carpathians. But under the growing influence of the then ruling Austro-Hungarian Empire, Orthodox clergy were reduced over time to the legal status of peasant-serfs, and even the bishop of Mukachevo was at the mercy of the Hungarian lords. To improve their condition, some Orthodox priests attempted to form a new church under the Catholics. In 1614, 50 priests convened at the Krasni Brid Monastery with this intent, but a crowd of Orthodox protested and dispersed the group. A second attempt in the 1630s under Bishop Vasyl Tarasovych also failed. Finally in April 1646, Bishop Parfenii Petrovich was able to convene a meeting of 63 (out of a few hundred) priests who pledged their allegiance to the Pope of Rome. Their signed document became known as the Union of Uzhhorod, resulting in the formation of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. This new Church was given greater material assistance from the Austro-Hungarian Empire while being allowed to maintain their Eastern Rite traditions, including married priests. From that time, the Rusyns had two bishops, one Greek Catholic and one Orthodox, until 1721 when the last remaining Orthodox priests in the western counties accepted the Union. Some priests in the eastern counties of Bereg and Maramaros remained Orthodox until 1745.

=== Recent history ===
In the 1890s, 145 years after Orthodoxy had ceased to exist in the Carpathians, a so-called &#x27;return to Orthodoxy&#x27; movement began, reaching a high point in the 1920s. Many Greek Catholics who became Orthodox were arrested for treason and a few were even executed by the government, with the Thalerhof internment camp and martyrdom (by firing squad) of the Orthodox priest Maxim Sandovich in 1914 being the best known incidents. Meanwhile, the Russian Bolshevik Revolution was forcing Russians of the nobility and middle class to flee, and many settled in the US. These Russians arrived and began joining the American Russian Orthodox Church (then called the Metropolia) at precisely the same time Carpatho-Russians in America were also &#x27;returning&#x27; to the Orthodox faith. This mixing furthered Russophile leanings among many Rusyns. Leading the charge was Fr. Alexis Toth, a former Greek Catholic priest who led as many as 20,000 Rusyn Americans to Orthodoxy, for which he was canonized by the Orthodox Church (due to his efforts, perhaps 1/3rd of American Rusyns are Orthodox today). This American mixing further influenced events and persecutions back in the Carpathian homeland, where thousands of fleeing Orthodox Russians also settled, including monks who founded the Ladomirova Monastery. Indeed, Laurus Škurla who was born in Ladomirova (now in Slovakia) rose to become Metropolitan Laurus, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.

Conversely, it was Greek Catholics of the Carpathians who suffered in the 1940s. By force, the Soviet government annulled the Union of Uzhhorod in 1946, and the Greek Catholic Church was liquidated exactly 300 years after its formation. The Greek Catholic Cathedral, Uzhhorod was transferred to the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church in 1948, and priests who refused to convert to Orthodoxy were sent to the Siberian and Arctic labor camps, where many died. Others were simply murdered in their home villages. A horrific example of this was the martyrdom (by assassination) of Greek Catholic Bishop Theodore Romzha. To add salt to the wound, in 1971 the Russian Orthodox Synod of Zagorsk, U.S.S.R. indirectly justified this violence by officially ratifying the annulment.

And while no longer the case, from the early and even until the mid-1900s in America, religious and nationalist causes went together. Aside from Russian Orthodox/Greek Catholic struggle, the dislike of Ukrainians by Rusyn religious leaders was strong and expressed often, as Ukrainian nationalism was deemed a destructive force to Rusyn culture. The influential newspaper of the American Greek Catholic Church, the &#x27;GCU Messenger&#x27;, wrote in 1954: &quot;To us Carpatho-Russian people here and in our native country under the green Carpathians, there can be no greater insult and offense then when someone calls us Ukrainians. We know not such people on the world&#x27;s map.&quot;

Europe Today

In Europe today, some tensions still exist. As an example, the aforementioned Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Cross in Uzhhorod belonged to the Greek Catholics but after WWII had been given to the Russian Orthodox Church by the Communist government. With the pending fall of communism, a well-meaning visit to this cathedral in February 1990 by American Byzantine Catholic (Greek Catholic) Archbishop Stephen Kocisko, whose own Rusyn parents were born in the Carpathians, led to confrontation from Rusyn Orthodox protestors. Later in 1991, there were major protests, including physical attacks and hunger strikes when it was decided to transfer the cathedral back to the Greek Catholics.

The Orthodox immediately set about to build a new Uzhhorod Orthodox Cathedral, under the guidance of the Rusyn Fr. Dimitry Sydor, a Moscow Patriarchate priest, who is perhaps the most controversial cleric in today&#x27;s Carpathians. In a nod to Moscow, the architecture of the new cathedral is based on the design of the famous and newly rebuilt Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, which is the largest church in all of Russia.

At the parish level, numerous churches which had been forcibly Orthodox for decades switched back to the Greek Catholic jurisdiction, and new ones were also constructed. As well, in spite of continued pressure, the region&#x27;s Greek Catholic Church steadfastly refuses to be included under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian oriented Lviv Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy. Notably and in another example of Rusyns going against the tide and seen as a pushback against Ukrainianism, an estimated 542 of the existing 550 Transcarpathian Orthodox churches chose to remain under the (Russian) Moscow Patriarchate rather than join the (Ukrainian) Kiev/Kyiv Patriarchate. And as of 2021 according to the Ukrainian government itself, Transcarpathia had one of the highest adherence levels in Ukraine to the Moscow Orthodox Patriarchate rather than the Kyiv Orthodox Patriarchate.

=== Greek Catholics ===
Many Rusyns are Eastern Catholics of the Byzantine Rite, who since the Union of Uzhhorod in 1646 have been in communion with the See of Rome. This church, the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, is distinct from the Latin Catholic Church. It has retained the Byzantine Rite liturgy, sometimes including the Church Slavonic language, the liturgical forms of Byzantine or Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and married priests.

The Pannonian Rusyns of Croatia are organized under the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Križevci, and those in the region of Vojvodina (northern Serbia), are organized under the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Ruski Krstur, headed by bishop Đura Džudžar, who is an ethnic Rusyn. Those in the diaspora in the United States established the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh.

=== Eastern Orthodox ===
Although originally associated with the Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo, that diocese was suppressed after the Union of Uzhhorod. New Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo and Prešov was created in 1931 under the auspices of the Serbian Orthodox Church. That eparchy was divided in 1945, eastern part joining Russian Orthodox Church as the Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhhorod, while western part was reorganized as Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Prešov of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church.

Many Rusyn Americans left Catholicism for Eastern Orthodoxy in the 19th century due to disputes with the Latin Church bishops, who viewed different practices in the Byzantine Rite (such as married clergy) with suspicion.
Another large segment of Rusyn Americans belong to the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, which is headquartered in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. From its early days, this group was recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate as a self-governing diocese.

The affiliation of Eastern Orthodox Rusyns was adversely affected by the Communist revolution in the Russian Empire and the subsequent Iron Curtain which split the Orthodox diaspora from the Eastern Orthodox believers living in the ancestral homelands. A number of émigré communities have claimed to continue the Orthodox Tradition of the pre-revolution church while either denying or minimizing the validity of the church organization operating under Communist authority.

For example, the Orthodox Church in America (OCA) was granted autocephalous (self-governing) status by the Moscow Patriarchate in 1970. Although approximately 25% of the OCA was Rusyn in the early 1980s, an influx of Eastern Orthodox émigrés from other nations and new converts wanting to connect with the Eastern Church have lessened the impact of a particular Rusyn emphasis in favor of a new American Orthodoxy.

In 1994, the historian Paul Robert Magocsi stated that there were approximately 690,000 Carpatho-Rusyn church members in the United States, with 320,000 belonging to the largest Greek Catholic affiliations, 270,000 to the largest Eastern Orthodox affiliations, and 100,000 to various Protestant and other denominations.

== Location ==


The traditional homeland of the Rusyn people, Carpathian Rus&#x27;, lies at the heart of the Carpathian mountains, on the borders of modern-day Ukraine, Poland, and Slovakia. Today, approximately three-quarters of Rusyns reside within Ukraine, specifically the geographic region known as Transcarpathia (historic Subcarpathian Rus&#x27;).

There also exists a multitude of Rusyn diaspora communities throughout neighboring countries in Europe and North America. The oldest of these diaspora communities is located in the Pannonian Plain. Since the mid-18th century, the resettled communities of Pannonia have existed in parts of present-day Serbia (particularly, Vojvodina, known historically as Bachka) and Croatia (in Vukovar-Srijem County). The United States holds the largest population of Rusyns outside of Carpathian Rus&#x27;, mostly within the former industrial centers of the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. At the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries, approximately 225,000 Rusyns emigrated here. Within Europe, Rusyns also migrated and settled in Prnjavor, a town in the northern region of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The community in the Czech Republic is located in northern Moravia and the capital of Prague. Populations of Rusyns also migrated to Canada and Argentina in the 1920s and Canada, Australia, and Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

== Demography ==
Of the estimated 1.2 to 1.6 million people of Rusyn origins, only around 90,000 individuals have been officially identified as such in recent national censuses (see infobox above). This is due, in part, to the refusal of some governments to count Rusyns and/or allow them to self-identify on census forms, especially in Ukraine. The ethnic classification of Rusyns as a separate East Slavic ethnicity distinct from Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians is, consequently, politically controversial. The claim that Rusyns are a Ukrainian subgroup is disputed by some non-mainstream scholars, as well as other scholars from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Canada, and the United States. According to the 2001 Ukrainian Census, thirty percent of Rusyns in Ukraine identified Ukrainian as their native language, while two thirds named the Rusyn language. However, about 10 thousand people, or 0.8%, of Ukraine&#x27;s Zakarpattia Oblast (Province) identified themselves as Rusyns; by contrast, over 1 million considered themselves Ukrainians. According to the 2022 Romanian census, there were 834 people (0.004% of the population) who identified themselves officially as Rusyns, and 594 who declared that their language was Rusyn.

The endonym &quot;Rusyn&quot; has frequently gone unrecognised by various governments, and has in other cases been prohibited. Today, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Serbia and Croatia officially recognize contemporary Rusyns as an ethnic minority. In 2007, Carpatho-Rusyns were recognized as a separate ethnicity in Ukraine by the Zakarpattia Oblast Council on a regional level, and in 2012 the Rusyn language gained official regional status in certain areas of the province, as well as nationwide based on the 2012 Law of Ukraine, &quot;On the principles of the state language policy&quot;. However, most contemporary self-identified ethnic Rusyns live outside of Ukraine.

=== Ethnic subgroups ===
Rusyns may be divided into two significant subgroups: Carpathian Rusyns and Pannonian Rusyns. While both groups are descendants of Rusyn populations from Carpathian Rus&#x27;, Pannonian Rusyns migrated from the Carpathian to parts of modern-day Croatia and Serbia (Vojvodina) in the 19th century. Additionally, the two groups speak different dialects (or languages, depending on the author): the former group speaking Carpathian Rusyn and the latter speaking Pannonian Rusyn.

Other more specific, regional subgroups (debatably) include Lemkos, Boykos, Hutsuls, and Dolinyans (lit. &quot;lowlanders&quot;). However, the Lemko-Boyko-Hutsul subdivision popular with Ukrainian scholars was only first promoted in the 1920s by the &quot;Lemko Committee&quot; and other contemporary Ukrainian scholars. Furthermore, while Lemkos and Rusyns are recognized as distinct ethnic minorities in Poland and Slovakia (respectively), neither Boykos nor Hutsuls are formally recognized in any country; nor are any Rusyns for that matter recognized as such in Ukraine.

Regarding these common ethnographic divisions, prominent Rusyn scholar, Paul Robert Magocsi, has said the following:

<text>The Arawhata River (often spelt with the Ngāi Tahu Māori dialect spelling &quot;Arawata River&quot;) is in the West Coast region of the South Island of New Zealand.

The river has its headwaters in the Mount Aspiring National Park. It drains the western side of the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana and heads in a northerly direction for , flowing into Jackson Bay / Okahu. A small lake, Lake Ellery, drains into the river near its mouth, via a short tributary, the Jackson River.

Access is possible up the river by jetboat. Access to the glaciers, forests and flats of the upper reaches of the valley is restricted by Ten Hour Gorge. Glacial silt in the river imparts an opaque green to greyish coloration to the water. The lower valley is grazed by cattle by the local farmers under a grazing licence. The majority of the land in the area is publicly owned and administered by the Department of Conservation.

Owing to the high rainfall on the western side of the Southern Alps, the river level can rapidly rise.

<text>The Dubai Classic (also known as the Dubai Duty Free Classic for sponsorship and marketing purposes) was a professional ranking snooker tournament. The last champion was Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

== History ==
It began life as the Dubai Masters in 1988, the first major tournament in the Middle East. The following year it was renamed to Dubai Classic, and it became the first ranking event in the Middle East. During its tenure in Dubai, the tournament was played at the multi-purpose stadium of the Al-Nasr Sports Club.

Later the event was moved to Thailand and renamed to Thailand Classic for 1995/96 and Asian Classic for 1996/97, before being dropped from the calendar.

<text>Sir Michael Hardie Boys, (6 October 1931 – 29 December 2023) was a New Zealand lawyer, judge and jurist who served as the 17th Governor-General of New Zealand, in office from 1996 to 2001.

==Early life and family==
Hardie Boys was born in 1931 in Wellington, the son of Edith May (née Bennett) and Reginald Hardie Boys (1903–1970), a lawyer and later judge of the Supreme Court. After his schooling at Hataitai School and Wellington College, Hardie Boys gained a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws from Victoria University College in 1954. Hardie Boys married Mary Zohrab, a great-granddaughter of Octavius Hadfield, in 1957. They had two sons and two daughters.

==Legal career==
A lawyer by profession, Hardie Boys was a partner in his father&#x27;s law firm; this became Scott Hardie Boys &amp; Morrison. He was on the council of the Wellington District Court Law Society (1973–1979) before he became its president in 1979. He was on the council of the New Zealand Law Society (1976–1979). For the New Zealand Law Society, he served on the Legal Aid Board before appointed its chairman in 1978.

Hardie Boys became a judge of the High Court of New Zealand in 1980 (prior to 1980, the name was Supreme Court, i.e. he sat in the same court that his father had). In 1989, he was elevated to the Court of Appeal, and was appointed a Privy Counsellor. In 1994, he was elected as an Honorary Bencher at Gray&#x27;s Inn, and in 1995 became an Honorary Fellow of Wolfson College, Cambridge. He was also a visiting fellow at Wolfson. In the 1996 New Year Honours, Hardie Boys was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.

==Governor-General==
On 21 March 1996, Hardie Boys was appointed by Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand on the advice of Prime Minister Jim Bolger, as the Governor-General of New Zealand. As the forthcoming 1996 general election would be the first mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) election, the appointment of a lawyer with an understanding of constitutional law was desirable. Bolger had notified all leaders of parties then represented in parliament, to ensure broad cross-party support. At subsequent appointments, other party leaders are only notified very shortly before the announcement is made, if at all.

In May 1996, shortly before the introduction of MMP, Hardie Boys announced that his role in the event of an unclear election outcome would be limited; he stated that he would not personally decide who led a government but would act on the advice of elected politicians.

In the 1996 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Hardie Boys was the first person appointed a Knight Grand Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit. He was also appointed a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem in April 1996.

Controversy ensued in 1996 when he stated his opposition to Minister of Youth Affairs Deborah Morris&#x27;s suggestion that young people have access to contraceptives. Later, in 2001, further controversy arose when he made an implied attack on the Clark Labour Government&#x27;s scrapping of the air defence wing of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

As governor-general, Hardie Boys had constitutional, ceremonial and community functions as per New Zealand&#x27;s conventions. The constitutional duties involved summoning parliament at the beginning of each parliamentary session, delivering the prime minister&#x27;s speech from the throne as part of these openings, the signing of bills that had been passed by parliament into law. Ceremonial duties included bestowing royal honours, and to prorogue parliament at the end of its term. Ceremonial duties included acting as patron for many of the country&#x27;s societies. 

Hardie Boys travelled extensively in the South Pacific, visiting Niue, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands – where he served as Governor-General – as well as Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia. His visits to New Caledonia and French Polynesia were the first by a New Zealand governor-general. Hardie Boys hosted United States President Bill Clinton during the 1999 APEC Summit in Auckland, and represented New Zealand at the 50th anniversary of NATO in Washington. He made a full state visit to China in November 2000.

Upon the completion of his term on 21 March 2001, Sir Michael and Lady Hardie Boys were both appointed additional Companions of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order.

==Retirement and death==
After his retirement as Governor-General of New Zealand, Hardie Boys served as a judge of the Kiribati Court of Appeal. He lived in retirement at Waikanae, where he helped out at Kapanui School&#x27;s literacy programme.

In 2004, Hardie Boys stated his opposition to New Zealand becoming a republic, stating in an interview: &quot;If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.&quot;

Hardie Boys died in Waikanae on 29 December 2023, at the age of 92. His wife, Mary, Lady Hardie Boys, died on 26 June 2024, also at Waikanae.

<text>Lądek-Zdrój (; ), known in English as Landek, is a spa town situated in Kłodzko County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, southwestern Poland. It is the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Lądek-Zdrój, close to the Czech border. As of 2019, the town has a population of 5,572.

==Geography==
It lies in the Sudetes in two mountain ranges - the Golden Mountains and the Śnieżnik Massif, approximately south-east of Kłodzko, and south of the regional capital Wrocław.

==History==
According to historical records, the therapeutic properties of the local mineral waters were already enjoyed in 1241, thus Lądek is considered the oldest spa town in Poland. Located within the historic Kłodzko Land, it was granted town rights in 1282 by Duke of Wrocław and future High Duke of Poland Henryk IV Probus of the Piast dynasty.

In 1949–1950 Greeks and Macedonians, refugees of the Greek Civil War, were temporarily admitted in Lądek-Zdrój, before new homes were found for them in other towns (see also: &quot;Greece–Poland relations&quot;).

The town was badly affected by the 2024 Central European floods.

==Culture==
Lądek-Zdrój is a picturesque spa town with rich historical architecture ranging from Gothic to Renaissance and Baroque, numerous sanatoriums, parks and gardens, including an arboretum, considered one of the oldest spa towns in Poland.

Lądek-Zdrój became famous in Poland because of Stanisław Bareja&#x27;s cult film &quot;Teddy Bear&quot; (&quot;Miś&quot;).

Each year, the town is host to the Andrzej Zawada mountain film festival.

<text>Lewis Nash (born December 30, 1958) is an American jazz drummer. According to &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine, Nash has one of the longest discographies in jazz and has played on over 400 records, earning him the honor of Jazz&#x27;s Most Valuable Player by the magazine in its May 2009 issue.

In 2012, The Nash Jazz Club,] opened in Phoenix, AZ. Named after Lewis Nash by Jazz in AZ 501(c)(3), The Nash Jazz Club is dedicated to performances and educational programs that promote jazz education. 

In 2017, Nash joined the jazz studies faculty at Arizona State University, where he was named the Bob and Gretchen Ravenscroft Professor of Practice in Jazz.

Nash is noted for his adaptability to a vast array of genres, as evidenced by his performances with such different musicians as Tommy Flanagan and Don Pullen. Nash has made 5 recordings as bandleader: &quot;Rhythm is My Business&quot; (1989), &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing&quot; (2003 Japanese import) and &quot;Stompin&#x27; at the Savoy&quot; (2005 Japanese import), &quot;Lewis Nash and the Bebop All-Stars featuring Frank Wess&quot; (2008 Japanese Import), and &quot;The Highest Mountain&quot; (2012).

<text>Hatfield Swamp is a fresh water wetland area in the U.S. state of New Jersey, forming what might be considered the &quot;second bank&quot; of the Passaic River between Morris and Essex counties.

==Geology==

During the late Triassic and early Jurassic periods, when the North American plate separated from the African plate, an aborted rift system was created. The resulting rift valley, known as the Newark Basin, was filled with alternating layers of red bed sediment and flood basalts. Over millions of years, the rift valley was faulted, tilted, and eroded, until the edges of the hard flood basalt layers formed ridges. Prior to 20,000 years before the present, an ancestral Passaic River flowed through a gap in these ridges. This changed when the Wisconsin Glacier, a massive continental ice sheet which formed during the last ice age, advanced on the region and permanently plugged the gap with glacial rubble. As the glacier eventually melted back, water pooled behind the ridges (known today as the Watchung Mountains), forming Glacial Lake Passaic. After thousands of years, the lake drained leaving behind many swamps with various hardwood trees struggling to take hold, including the Hatfield Swamp.

==Geography==

The Whippany River flows into the Rockaway River, at the western end of the swamp. The Rockaway River travels a short distance and then flows into the Passaic River near the center of the swamp. The USGS gaging station is downstream of the Rockaway River confluence. At this point the Passaic River drainage is three hundred forty nine square miles. This includes the Rockaway River drainage of one hundred twenty five square miles and the Whippany River drainage of sixty nine square miles.

The area is from above sea level to . Latitude 40.85 N and Longitude 74.32 W

The area of Hatfield Swamp is approximately , located in northern New Jersey.

==History==

The swamp is named for Cornelius Hetfield who owned and operated a mill sometime before the American Revolution. During the struggle, the properties of Hetfield, an acknowledged Loyalist, were confiscated and sold to Cyrus Crane, who operated a mill on the edge of the swamp in what is now West Caldwell. After the death of family member Herbert Crane in the 1960s, the mill was dismantled and moved to Allaire State Park in Monmouth County, New Jersey.

==Flora and fauna==
The Hatfield Swamp floods several times a year, from heavy rain, snow melt in spring, or the remnants of storms that originated in the tropics. The area is the joining point of three rivers. The frequent flooding makes the swamp a difficult place to live for mammals, such as deer, raccoons, possums, skunks and fox. Most of these animals live on the fringes of the swamp, where the ground is higher.

Muskrats are low in population in the swamp due to several factors. The first is the flooding of the area, which fills bank dens with water. The second is the lack of plant foods that the muskrats eat. The third is water pollution. While efforts to clean the rivers of pollution have proven successful so far, pollutants remain in the soil and water.

Waterfowl that pass through the area in the autumn stop and rest in the swamp before proceeding south.

Fish that inhabit the Rockaway River and Whippany River are carp and catfish.

The area has a northern deciduous forest consisting of various oaks, maples, sweet gum, and elm. Most trees are from six to ten inches (254 mm), with some going to twenty inches. Due to the constant flooding makes it difficult for hardwood trees to grow.

==Hiking==

The wetlands, which help facilitate hiking through their flatness, are a part of West Essex Park, and there are a number of trails open for public hiking. Both the Essex County Chapter of the Sierra Club and the New Jersey Audubon Society lead trips within the swamp throughout the year, while the Essex County Environmental Center provides information regarding such trips.

<text>In demographics, clustering is the gathering of various populations based on ethnicity, economics, or religion.

In countries that hold equality important, clustering occurs between groups because of polarizing factors such as religion, wealth or ethnocentrism. Clustering is often considered an enriching part of free cultures in which one can visit a Chinatown or a French quarter for restaurant choices. Other sociologists assert that clustering of like minded individuals leads to political polarity and intolerance of contrary opinions, as the United States has allegedly been trending since the 1950s.

<text>Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some specific sense defined by the analyst) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.

Cluster analysis refers to a family of algorithms and tasks rather than one specific algorithm. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.

Besides the term &quot;clustering&quot;, there are a number of terms with similar meanings, including &quot;automatic classification&quot;, &quot;numerical taxonomy&quot;, &quot;botryology&quot; (from ), &quot;typological analysis&quot;, and &quot;community detection&quot;. The subtle differences are often in the use of the results: while in data mining, the resulting groups are the matter of interest, in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest.

Cluster analysis originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938 and Robert Tryon in 1939 and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology.

== Definition ==

The notion of a &quot;cluster&quot; cannot be precisely defined, which is one of the reasons why there are so many clustering algorithms. There is a common denominator: a group of data objects. However, different researchers employ different cluster models, and for each of these cluster models again different algorithms can be given. The notion of a cluster, as found by different algorithms, varies significantly in its properties. Understanding these &quot;cluster models&quot; is key to understanding the differences between the various algorithms. Typical cluster models include:
* &quot;s&quot;: for example, hierarchical clustering builds models based on distance connectivity.
* &quot;s&quot;: for example, the k-means algorithm represents each cluster by a single mean vector.
* &quot;s&quot;: clusters are modeled using statistical distributions, such as multivariate normal distributions used by the expectation-maximization algorithm.
* &quot;s&quot;: for example, DBSCAN and OPTICS defines clusters as connected dense regions in the data space.
* &quot;s&quot;: in biclustering (also known as co-clustering or two-mode-clustering), clusters are modeled with both cluster members and relevant attributes.
* &quot;s&quot;: some algorithms do not provide a refined model for their results and just provide the grouping information.
* &quot;s&quot;: a clique, that is, a subset of nodes in a graph such that every two nodes in the subset are connected by an edge can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster. Relaxations of the complete connectivity requirement (a fraction of the edges can be missing) are known as quasi-cliques, as in the HCS clustering algorithm.
* &quot;Signed graph models&quot;: Every path in a signed graph has a sign from the product of the signs on the edges. Under the assumptions of balance theory, edges may change sign and result in a bifurcated graph. The weaker &quot;clusterability axiom&quot; (no cycle has exactly one negative edge) yields results with more than two clusters, or subgraphs with only positive edges.
* &quot;s&quot;: the most well-known unsupervised neural network is the self-organizing map and these models can usually be characterized as similar to one or more of the above models, and including subspace models when neural networks implement a form of Principal Component Analysis or Independent Component Analysis.

A &quot;clustering&quot; is essentially a set of such clusters, usually containing all objects in the data set. Additionally, it may specify the relationship of the clusters to each other, for example, a hierarchy of clusters embedded in each other. Clusterings can be roughly distinguished as:
* &quot;: each object belongs to a cluster or not
* &#x27; (also: &#x27;): each object belongs to each cluster to a certain degree (for example, a likelihood of belonging to the cluster)

There are also finer distinctions possible, for example:

* &quot;: each object belongs to exactly one cluster
* &quot;: objects can also belong to no cluster; in which case they are considered outliers
* &quot; (also: &quot;alternative clustering&quot;, &quot;multi-view clustering&quot;): objects may belong to more than one cluster; usually involving hard clusters
* &quot;: objects that belong to a child cluster also belong to the parent cluster
* &quot;: while an overlapping clustering, within a uniquely defined subspace, clusters are not expected to overlap

== Algorithms ==
As listed above, clustering algorithms can be categorized based on their cluster model. The following overview will only list the most prominent examples of clustering algorithms, as there are possibly over 100 published clustering algorithms. Not all provide models for their clusters and can thus not easily be categorized. An overview of algorithms explained in Wikipedia can be found in the list of statistics algorithms.

There is no objectively &quot;correct&quot; clustering algorithm, but as it was noted, &quot;clustering is in the eye of the beholder.&quot; In fact, an axiomatic approach to clustering demonstrates that it is impossible for any clustering method to meet three fundamental properties simultaneously: scale invariance (results remain unchanged under proportional scaling of distances), richness (all possible partitions of the data can be achieved), and consistency between distances and the clustering structure. The most appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular problem often needs to be chosen experimentally, unless there is a mathematical reason to prefer one cluster model over another. An algorithm that is designed for one kind of model will generally fail on a data set that contains a radically different kind of model. For example, k-means cannot find non-convex clusters. Most traditional clustering methods assume the clusters exhibit a spherical, elliptical or convex shape. 

=== Connectivity-based clustering (hierarchical clustering) ===

Connectivity-based clustering, also known as &quot;hierarchical clustering&quot;, is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away. These algorithms connect &quot;objects&quot; to form &quot;clusters&quot; based on their distance. A cluster can be described largely by the maximum distance needed to connect parts of the cluster. At different distances, different clusters will form, which can be represented using a dendrogram, which explains where the common name &quot;hierarchical clustering&quot; comes from: these algorithms do not provide a single partitioning of the data set, but instead provide an extensive hierarchy of clusters that merge with each other at certain distances. In a dendrogram, the y-axis marks the distance at which the clusters merge, while the objects are placed along the x-axis such that the clusters don&#x27;t mix.

Connectivity-based clustering is a whole family of methods that differ by the way distances are computed. Apart from the usual choice of distance functions, the user also needs to decide on the linkage criterion (since a cluster consists of multiple objects, there are multiple candidates to compute the distance) to use. Popular choices are known as single-linkage clustering (the minimum of object distances), complete linkage clustering (the maximum of object distances), and UPGMA or WPGMA (&quot;Unweighted or Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean&quot;, also known as average linkage clustering). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (starting with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive (starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions).

These methods will not produce a unique partitioning of the data set, but a hierarchy from which the user still needs to choose appropriate clusters. They are not very robust towards outliers, which will either show up as additional clusters or even cause other clusters to merge (known as &quot;chaining phenomenon&quot;, in particular with single-linkage clustering). In the general case, the complexity is formula_1 for agglomerative clustering and formula_2 for divisive clustering, which makes them too slow for large data sets. For some special cases, optimal efficient methods (of complexity formula_3) are known: SLINK for single-linkage and CLINK for complete-linkage clustering.

=== Centroid-based clustering ===

In centroid-based clustering, each cluster is represented by a central vector, which is not necessarily a member of the data set. When the number of clusters is fixed to &quot;k&quot;, &quot;k&quot;-means clustering gives a formal definition as an optimization problem: find the &quot;k&quot; cluster centers and assign the objects to the nearest cluster center, such that the squared distances from the cluster are minimized.

The optimization problem itself is known to be NP-hard, and thus the common approach is to search only for approximate solutions. A particularly well-known approximate method is Lloyd&#x27;s algorithm, often just referred to as &quot;k-means algorithm&quot; (although another algorithm introduced this name). It does however only find a local optimum, and is commonly run multiple times with different random initializations. Variations of &quot;k&quot;-means often include such optimizations as choosing the best of multiple runs, but also restricting the centroids to members of the data set (&quot;k&quot;-medoids), choosing medians (&quot;k&quot;-medians clustering), choosing the initial centers less randomly (&quot;k&quot;-means++) or allowing a fuzzy cluster assignment (fuzzy c-means).

Most &quot;k&quot;-means-type algorithms require the number of clusters – &quot;k&quot; – to be specified in advance, which is considered to be one of the biggest drawbacks of these algorithms. Furthermore, the algorithms prefer clusters of approximately similar size, as they will always assign an object to the nearest centroid. This often leads to incorrectly cut borders of clusters (which is not surprising since the algorithm optimizes cluster centers, not cluster borders).

K-means has a number of interesting theoretical properties. First, it partitions the data space into a structure known as a Voronoi diagram. Second, it is conceptually close to nearest neighbor classification, and as such is popular in machine learning. Third, it can be seen as a variation of model-based clustering, and Lloyd&#x27;s algorithm as a variation of the Expectation-maximization algorithm for this model discussed below.

Centroid-based clustering problems such as &quot;k&quot;-means and &quot;k&quot;-medoids are special cases of the uncapacitated, metric facility location problem, a canonical problem in the operations research and computational geometry communities. In a basic facility location problem (of which there are numerous variants that model more elaborate settings), the task is to find the best warehouse locations to optimally service a given set of consumers. One may view &quot;warehouses&quot; as cluster centroids and &quot;consumer locations&quot; as the data to be clustered. This makes it possible to apply the well-developed algorithmic solutions from the facility location literature to the presently considered centroid-based clustering problem.

=== Model-based clustering ===
The clustering framework most closely related to statistics is model-based clustering, which is based on distribution models. This approach models the data as arising from a mixture of probability distributions. It has the advantages of providing principled statistical answers to questions such as how many clusters there are, what clustering method or model to use, and how to detect and deal with outliers.

While the theoretical foundation of these methods is excellent, they suffer from overfitting unless constraints are put on the model complexity. A more complex model will usually be able to explain the data better, which makes choosing the appropriate model complexity inherently difficult. Standard model-based clustering methods include more parsimonious models based on the eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrices, that provide a balance between overfitting and fidelity to the data.

One prominent method is known as Gaussian mixture models (using the expectation-maximization algorithm). Here, the data set is usually modeled with a fixed (to avoid overfitting) number of Gaussian distributions that are initialized randomly and whose parameters are iteratively optimized to better fit the data set. This will converge to a local optimum, so multiple runs may produce different results. In order to obtain a hard clustering, objects are often then assigned to the Gaussian distribution they most likely belong to; for soft clusterings, this is not necessary.

Distribution-based clustering produces complex models for clusters that can capture correlation and dependence between attributes. However, these algorithms put an extra burden on the user: for many real data sets, there may be no concisely defined mathematical model (e.g. assuming Gaussian distributions is a rather strong assumption on the data).

=== Density-based clustering ===
In density-based clustering, clusters are defined as areas of higher density than the remainder of the data set. Objects in sparse areas – that are required to separate clusters – are usually considered to be noise and border points.

The most popular density-based clustering method is DBSCAN. In contrast to many newer methods, it features a well-defined cluster model called &quot;density-reachability&quot;. Similar to linkage-based clustering, it is based on connecting points within certain distance thresholds. However, it only connects points that satisfy a density criterion, in the original variant defined as a minimum number of other objects within this radius. A cluster consists of all density-connected objects (which can form a cluster of an arbitrary shape, in contrast to many other methods) plus all objects that are within these objects&#x27; range. Another interesting property of DBSCAN is that its complexity is fairly low – it requires a linear number of range queries on the database – and that it will discover essentially the same results (it is deterministic for core and noise points, but not for border points) in each run, therefore there is no need to run it multiple times. OPTICS is a generalization of DBSCAN that removes the need to choose an appropriate value for the range parameter formula_4, and produces a hierarchical result related to that of linkage clustering. DeLi-Clu, Density-Link-Clustering combines ideas from single-linkage clustering and OPTICS, eliminating the formula_4 parameter entirely and offering performance improvements over OPTICS by using an R-tree index.

The key drawback of DBSCAN and OPTICS is that they expect some kind of density drop to detect cluster borders. On data sets with, for example, overlapping Gaussian distributions – a common use case in artificial data – the cluster borders produced by these algorithms will often look arbitrary, because the cluster density decreases continuously. On a data set consisting of mixtures of Gaussians, these algorithms are nearly always outperformed by methods such as EM clustering that are able to precisely model this kind of data.

Mean-shift is a clustering approach where each object is moved to the densest area in its vicinity, based on kernel density estimation. Eventually, objects converge to local maxima of density. Similar to k-means clustering, these &quot;density attractors&quot; can serve as representatives for the data set, but mean-shift can detect arbitrary-shaped clusters similar to DBSCAN. Due to the expensive iterative procedure and density estimation, mean-shift is usually slower than DBSCAN or k-Means. Besides that, the applicability of the mean-shift algorithm to multidimensional data is hindered by the unsmooth behaviour of the kernel density estimate, which results in over-fragmentation of cluster tails.

=== Grid-based clustering ===
The grid-based technique is used for a multi-dimensional data set. In this technique, we create a grid structure, and the comparison is performed on grids (also known as cells). The grid-based technique is fast and has low computational complexity. There are two types of grid-based clustering methods: STING and CLIQUE. Steps involved in grid-based clustering algorithm are:
# Divide data space into a finite number of cells.
# Randomly select a cell ‘c’, where c should not be traversed beforehand.
# Calculate the density of ‘c’
# If the density of ‘c’ greater than threshold density
## Mark cell ‘c’ as a new cluster
## Calculate the density of all the neighbors of ‘c’
## If the density of a neighboring cell is greater than threshold density then, add the cell in the cluster and repeat steps 4.2 and 4.3 till there is no neighbor with a density greater than threshold density.
# Repeat steps 2,3 and 4 till all the cells are traversed.
# Stop.

=== Recent developments ===
In recent years, considerable effort has been put into improving the performance of existing algorithms. Among them are &quot;CLARANS&quot;, and &quot;BIRCH&quot;. With the recent need to process larger and larger data sets (also known as big data), the willingness to trade semantic meaning of the generated clusters for performance has been increasing. This led to the development of pre-clustering methods such as canopy clustering, which can process huge data sets efficiently, but the resulting &quot;clusters&quot; are merely a rough pre-partitioning of the data set to then analyze the partitions with existing slower methods such as k-means clustering.

For high-dimensional data, many of the existing methods fail due to the curse of dimensionality, which renders particular distance functions problematic in high-dimensional spaces. This led to new clustering algorithms for high-dimensional data that focus on subspace clustering (where only some attributes are used, and cluster models include the relevant attributes for the cluster) and correlation clustering that also looks for arbitrary rotated (&quot;correlated&quot;) subspace clusters that can be modeled by giving a correlation of their attributes. Examples for such clustering algorithms are CLIQUE and SUBCLU.

Ideas from density-based clustering methods (in particular the DBSCAN/OPTICS family of algorithms) have been adapted to subspace clustering (HiSC, hierarchical subspace clustering and DiSH) and correlation clustering (HiCO, hierarchical correlation clustering, 4C using &quot;correlation connectivity&quot; and ERiC exploring hierarchical density-based correlation clusters).

Several different clustering systems based on mutual information have been proposed. One is Marina Meilă&#x27;s &quot;variation of information&quot; metric; another provides hierarchical clustering. Using genetic algorithms, a wide range of different fit-functions can be optimized, including mutual information. Also belief propagation, a recent development in computer science and statistical physics, has led to the creation of new types of clustering algorithms.

== Evaluation and assessment ==
Evaluation (or &quot;validation&quot;) of clustering results is as difficult as the clustering itself. Popular approaches involve &quot;&quot;internal&quot; evaluation, where the clustering is summarized to a single quality score, &quot;external&quot;&quot; evaluation, where the clustering is compared to an existing &quot;ground truth&quot; classification, &quot;&quot;manual&quot; evaluation by a human expert, and &quot;indirect&quot;&quot; evaluation by evaluating the utility of the clustering in its intended application.

Internal evaluation measures suffer from the problem that they represent functions that themselves can be seen as a clustering objective. For example, one could cluster the data set by the Silhouette coefficient; except that there is no known efficient algorithm for this. By using such an internal measure for evaluation, one rather compares the similarity of the optimization problems, and not necessarily how useful the clustering is.

External evaluation has similar problems: if we have such &quot;ground truth&quot; labels, then we would not need to cluster; and in practical applications we usually do not have such labels. On the other hand, the labels only reflect one possible partitioning of the data set, which does not imply that there does not exist a different, and maybe even better, clustering.

Neither of these approaches can therefore ultimately judge the actual quality of a clustering, but this needs human evaluation, which is highly subjective. Nevertheless, such statistics can be quite informative in identifying bad clusterings, but one should not dismiss subjective human evaluation.

=== Internal evaluation ===

When a clustering result is evaluated based on the data that was clustered itself, this is called internal evaluation. These methods usually assign the best score to the algorithm that produces clusters with high similarity within a cluster and low similarity between clusters. One drawback of using internal criteria in cluster evaluation is that high scores on an internal measure do not necessarily result in effective information retrieval applications. Additionally, this evaluation is biased towards algorithms that use the same cluster model. For example, k-means clustering naturally optimizes object distances, and a distance-based internal criterion will likely overrate the resulting clustering.

Therefore, the internal evaluation measures are best suited to get some insight into situations where one algorithm performs better than another, but this shall not imply that one algorithm produces more valid results than another. Validity as measured by such an index depends on the claim that this kind of structure exists in the data set. An algorithm designed for some kind of models has no chance if the data set contains a radically different set of models, or if the evaluation measures a radically different criterion. For example, k-means clustering can only find convex clusters, and many evaluation indexes assume convex clusters. On a data set with non-convex clusters neither the use of &quot;k&quot;-means, nor of an evaluation criterion that assumes convexity, is sound.

More than a dozen of internal evaluation measures exist, usually based on the intuition that items in the same cluster should be more similar than items in different clusters. For example, the following methods can be used to assess the quality of clustering algorithms based on internal criterion:

* Davies–Bouldin index
:The Davies–Bouldin index can be calculated by the following formula:
::formula_6
:where &quot;n&quot; is the number of clusters, formula_7 is the centroid of cluster formula_8, formula_9 is the average distance of all elements in cluster formula_8 to centroid formula_7, and formula_12 is the distance between centroids formula_7 and formula_14. Since algorithms that produce clusters with low intra-cluster distances (high intra-cluster similarity) and high inter-cluster distances (low inter-cluster similarity) will have a low Davies–Bouldin index, the clustering algorithm that produces a collection of clusters with the smallest Davies–Bouldin index is considered the best algorithm based on this criterion.

*Dunn index
:The Dunn index aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:
::formula_15
:where &quot;d&quot;(&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) represents the distance between clusters &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(&quot;k&quot;) measures the intra-cluster distance of cluster &quot;k&quot;. The inter-cluster distance &quot;d&quot;(&quot;i&quot;,&quot;j&quot;) between two clusters may be any number of distance measures, such as the distance between the centroids of the clusters. Similarly, the intra-cluster distance &quot;d&quot; &#x27;(&quot;k&quot;) may be measured in a variety of ways, such as the maximal distance between any pair of elements in cluster &quot;k&quot;. Since internal criterion seek clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.
*Silhouette coefficient
:The silhouette coefficient contrasts the average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to elements in other clusters. Objects with a high silhouette value are considered well clustered, objects with a low value may be outliers. This index works well with &quot;k&quot;-means clustering, and is also used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

=== External evaluation ===
In external evaluation, clustering results are evaluated based on data that was not used for clustering, such as known class labels and external benchmarks. Such benchmarks consist of a set of pre-classified items, and these sets are often created by (expert) humans. Thus, the benchmark sets can be thought of as a gold standard for evaluation. These types of evaluation methods measure how close the clustering is to the predetermined benchmark classes. However, it has recently been discussed whether this is adequate for real data, or only on synthetic data sets with a factual ground truth, since classes can contain internal structure, the attributes present may not allow separation of clusters or the classes may contain anomalies. Additionally, from a knowledge discovery point of view, the reproduction of known knowledge may not necessarily be the intended result. In the special scenario of constrained clustering, where meta information (such as class labels) is used already in the clustering process, the hold-out of information for evaluation purposes is non-trivial.

A number of measures are adapted from variants used to evaluate classification tasks. In place of counting the number of times a class was correctly assigned to a single data point (known as true positives), such &quot;pair counting&quot; metrics assess whether each pair of data points that is truly in the same cluster is predicted to be in the same cluster.

As with internal evaluation, several external evaluation measures exist, for example:
* Purity: Purity is a measure of the extent to which clusters contain a single class. Its calculation can be thought of as follows: For each cluster, count the number of data points from the most common class in said cluster. Now take the sum over all clusters and divide by the total number of data points. Formally, given some set of clusters formula_16 and some set of classes formula_17, both partitioning formula_18 data points, purity can be defined as:
::formula_19
:This measure doesn&#x27;t penalize having many clusters, and more clusters will make it easier to produce a high purity. A purity score of 1 is always possible by putting each data point in its own cluster. Also, purity doesn&#x27;t work well for imbalanced data, where even poorly performing clustering algorithms will give a high purity value. For example, if a size 1000 dataset consists of two classes, one containing 999 points and the other containing 1 point, then every possible partition will have a purity of at least 99.9%. 
* Rand index
:The Rand index computes how similar the clusters (returned by the clustering algorithm) are to the benchmark classifications. It can be computed using the following formula:
::formula_20
:where formula_21 is the number of true positives, formula_22 is the number of true negatives, formula_23 is the number of false positives, and formula_24 is the number of false negatives. The instances being counted here are the number of correct &quot;pairwise&quot; assignments. That is, formula_21 is the number of pairs of points that are clustered together in the predicted partition and in the ground truth partition, formula_23 is the number of pairs of points that are clustered together in the predicted partition but not in the ground truth partition etc. If the dataset is of size N, then formula_27. 
One issue with the Rand index is that false positives and false negatives are equally weighted. This may be an undesirable characteristic for some clustering applications. The F-measure addresses this concern, as does the chance-corrected adjusted Rand index.
*F-measure
:The F-measure can be used to balance the contribution of false negatives by weighting recall through a parameter formula_28. Let precision and recall (both external evaluation measures in themselves) be defined as follows:
::formula_29
::formula_30
:where formula_31 is the precision rate and formula_32 is the recall rate. We can calculate the F-measure by using the following formula:
::formula_33
:When formula_34, formula_35. In other words, recall has no impact on the F-measure when formula_34, and increasing formula_37 allocates an increasing amount of weight to recall in the final F-measure.
:Also formula_22 is not taken into account and can vary from 0 upward without bound.
* Jaccard index
:The Jaccard index is used to quantify the similarity between two datasets. The Jaccard index takes on a value between 0 and 1. An index of 1 means that the two dataset are identical, and an index of 0 indicates that the datasets have no common elements. The Jaccard index is defined by the following formula:
::formula_39
:This is simply the number of unique elements common to both sets divided by the total number of unique elements in both sets.
:Note that formula_22 is not taken into account.
* Dice index
:The Dice symmetric measure doubles the weight on formula_21 while still ignoring formula_22:
::formula_43
* Fowlkes–Mallows index
:The Fowlkes–Mallows index computes the similarity between the clusters returned by the clustering algorithm and the benchmark classifications. The higher the value of the Fowlkes–Mallows index the more similar the clusters and the benchmark classifications are. It can be computed using the following formula:
::formula_44
:where formula_21 is the number of true positives, formula_23 is the number of false positives, and formula_24 is the number of false negatives. The formula_48 index is the geometric mean of the precision and recall formula_31 and formula_32, and is thus also known as the G-measure, while the F-measure is their harmonic mean. Moreover, precision and recall are also known as Wallace&#x27;s indices formula_51 and formula_52. Chance normalized versions of recall, precision and G-measure correspond to Informedness, Markedness and Matthews Correlation and relate strongly to Kappa.

* Chi Index is an external validation index that measure the clustering results by applying the chi-squared statistic. This index scores positively the fact that the labels are as sparse as possible across the clusters, i.e., that each cluster has as few different labels as possible. The higher the value of the Chi Index the greater the relationship between the resulting clusters and the label used.
* The mutual information is an information theoretic measure of how much information is shared between a clustering and a ground-truth classification that can detect a non-linear similarity between two clusterings. Normalized mutual information is a family of corrected-for-chance variants of this that has a reduced bias for varying cluster numbers.
* Confusion matrix
:A confusion matrix can be used to quickly visualize the results of a classification (or clustering) algorithm. It shows how different a cluster is from the gold standard cluster.

=== Cluster tendency ===

To measure cluster tendency is to measure to what degree clusters exist in the data to be clustered, and may be performed as an initial test, before attempting clustering. One way to do this is to compare the data against random data. On average, random data should not have clusters.

*Hopkins statistic
:There are multiple formulations of the Hopkins statistic. A typical one is as follows. Let formula_53 be the set of formula_54 data points in formula_55 dimensional space. Consider a random sample (without replacement) of formula_56 data points with members formula_57. Also generate a set formula_58 of formula_59 uniformly randomly distributed data points. Now define two distance measures, formula_60 to be the distance of formula_61 from its nearest neighbor in X and formula_62 to be the distance of formula_63 from its nearest neighbor in X. We then define the Hopkins statistic as:
:: formula_64
:With this definition, uniform random data should tend to have values near to 0.5, and clustered data should tend to have values nearer to 1.
:However, data containing just a single Gaussian will also score close to 1, as this statistic measures deviation from a &quot;uniform&quot; distribution, not multimodality, making this statistic largely useless in application (as real data never is remotely uniform).

; Educational data mining
:Cluster analysis is for example used to identify groups of schools or students with similar properties.
; Typologies
:From poll data, projects such as those undertaken by the Pew Research Center use cluster analysis to discern typologies of opinions, habits, and demographics that may be useful in politics and marketing.

===Others===

; Field robotics
:Clustering algorithms are used for robotic situational awareness to track objects and detect outliers in sensor data.

; Mathematical chemistry
:To find structural similarity, etc., for example, 3000 chemical compounds were clustered in the space of 90 topological indices.

; Climatology
:To find weather regimes or preferred sea level pressure atmospheric patterns.

; Finance
:Cluster analysis has been used to cluster stocks into sectors.

;Petroleum geology
:Cluster analysis is used to reconstruct missing bottom hole core data or missing log curves in order to evaluate reservoir properties.

; Geochemistry
:The clustering of chemical properties in different sample locations.

<text>Rudolf Schoenheimer (May 10, 1898 – September 11, 1941) was a German-American biochemist who developed the technique of isotope labelling of biomolecules, enabling detailed study of metabolism. This work revealed that all the constituents of an organism are in a constant state of chemical renewal.

Born in Berlin, after graduating in medicine from the Friedrich Wilhelm University there, he learned further organic chemistry at the University of Leipzig and then studied biochemistry at the University of Freiburg where he rose to be Head of Physiological Chemistry.

He spent the 1930-31 academic year at the University of Chicago.
In 1933, following the rise of the Nazis to power he emigrated from Germany to the Columbia University to join the department of Biological Chemistry. Working with David Rittenberg, from the radiochemistry laboratory of Harold C. Urey and later together with Konrad Bloch, they used stable isotopes to &quot;tag&quot; foodstuffs and trace their metabolism within living things.

He further established that cholesterol is a risk factor in atherosclerosis.

He suffered from manic depression all of his life, which led to him in 1941 committing suicide using sodium cyanide. He had been honoured with the request to give the Dunham Lecture at Harvard before his death. It was read for him following his death.

==Early life and education==
Rudolf Schoenheimer was born in Berlin, Germany on 10 May 1898. He was the son of Gertrude Edel and Hugo Schoenheimer, who was a physician. He was Jewish, however his family converted to Christianity. He attended local schools in Berlin before graduating from the Dorotheen-Stadtische Gymnasium in 1916. Following his graduation Schoenheimer was drafted into the German army. He served in the artillery on the western front for two years during world war 1. Following his service in the war, he began his study of medicine at the University of Berlin. In 1922 he received his M.D. His M.D dissertation was titled &quot;Über die experimentelle Cholesterinkrankheit der Kaninchen&quot; (&quot;About the experimental cholesterol disease of rabbits&quot;). He then spent a year working at the Moabit Hospital in Berlin as a pathologist. He continued his scientific research during this time and studied the production of atherosclerosis in animals through administering cholesterol.  

In 1924, Schoenheimer began his 3-year study at the University of Leipzig, in a program aimed at advancing his knowledge in chemistry. The program was aided by the Rockefeller Foundation and taught by Karl Thomas, professor of physiological chemistry at the University of Leipzig. During his time at Leipzig, Schoenheimer was able to develop a method of synthesising peptides.

==Career==
After his studies at Leipzig had ended, he began a year of work at the Moabit Hospital in Berlin as the resident pathologist. During this time, he began his research and studies on the issue of atherosclerosis. His first published works, dated during this period were in on the development of atherosclerosis in experimental animals when administered cholesterol. He also spent time working in the laboratory of Peter Rona at the Berlin Municipal Hospital.

In 1926, Schoenheimer was invited by Ludwig Aschoff to join the faculty at the University of Freiburg. There he worked as an assistant professor. The investigation of pathological material was part of his work duties. During this time, he also researched atherosclerosis and the role of dietary cholesterol in its development. He became the active in 1927, and then the titular, head of his division in 1931.

In 1930, until 1931, Schoenheimer was in the United States as the Douglas Smith Fellow at the University of Chicago. During this time Schoenheimer came into contact with the Josiah Macy Jr Foundation. Later in 1931, The Macy Foundation, with Ludwig Kast as its president, started supporting Schoenheimer in his atherosclerosis studies. Following his fellowship, he returned to the University of Freiburg, taking the position of head of the Pathological Chemistry department.  

===Columbia University: 1933-1934===

In April 1933, Schoenheimer emigrated to the United States in response to the Nazi regime&#x27;s policy for the dismissal of Jewish faculty in universities. He was offered work at Columbia University as an assistant professor, where he continued his research on metabolism and cholesterol synthesis, alongside Walter M. Sperry and David Rittenberg.

In 1933, Germany entered a political crisis and saw the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party, which led Schoenheimer into emigrating to the United States. Schoenheimer had Jewish heritage which he was conscious of despite his Family having converted to Christianity. Schoenheimer had joined a Jewish Youth Movement and was actively involved in the Zionist Organisation following WW1. Due to the situation in Germany at the time and the Nazi Policy dismissing Jewish faculty, Schoenheimer was unlikely to remain living in Germany. Ludwig Kast was informed of this situation and contacted U.S universities, Cornell and Columbia on behalf of Schoenheimer. Hans T. Clarke, the Chairman of the Biological Chemistry Department at the University of Columbia, invited Schoenheimer to work at the University. He began work in the Department of Biological Chemistry as a research assistant. The Josiah Macy Foundation provided his salary and research support whilst he worked at Columbia. At Columbia Schoenheimer was among others that shared similar interests in Biochemistry and wanted it to move in the direction of organic chemistry.

==Scientific work==
Schoenheimer&#x27;s scientific work contributed to biochemistry and metabolic studies, with his most significant work being the application of isotopes to the study of intermediary metabolism. Schoenheimer&#x27;s earlier scientific work in the 1920s centered on the physiology and pathology of sterols.

===Early work: 1924-1933===
In 1926, while at the University of Leipzig, Schoenheimer developed a method of synthesising peptides. From 1903 to 1909, Emil Fischer&#x27;s scientific work had prompted the synthesis of many peptides, however there were limitations to his method. Fischer used a halogen acyl amino acid halide coupling method. A suitable method was needed, which involved an amino blocking group being removed by a nonhydrolyptic process. This method was first proposed by Rudolph Schoenheimer, as he utilised earlier findings by Michel Bergmann which demonstrated that with a mixture of hydrogen iodide and phosphonium iodide, p-toluenesulfonyl amino acids could be detosylated reductively. Schoenheimer used the azide coupling method introduced by Theodor Curtius, and the acid chloride method introduced by Emil Fischer in order to make several peptides.  

In 1929, Schoenheimer investigated how different sterols impacted cholesterol deposition in rabbits. It had been assumed that only plants were able to synthesize complex compounds whilst animals were forced to obtain these compounds indirectly from plants. It was assumed also that there would only small chemical changes were necessary when modifying these compounds to suit specific needs. Previous cholesterol-balance studies indicated that under specific conditions, animals could possess the ability to form cholesterol, as it has been discovered that sometimes negative balances are present in metabolic studies, wherein more sterol is excreted than consumed. These observations did not demonstrate whether cholesterol present in the animal body was due to synthesis or whether it had all actually come from vegetable food. The transformation of plant sterols into cholesterol within the body of an animal requires the sterol to be absorbable. This is the notion Schoenheimer investigated in his experiments. One of his experiments involved administering two different diets to a group of rabbits. Rabbits are sensitive to a diet which includes cholesterol, and their bodily responses particularly that of the aorta demonstrates a change that similarly resembles the Human atherosclerosis. In the experiment one diet involved a large amount of sito-sterol, which is a type of plant sterol. The other diet included cholesterol. The observations of the experiment indicated that Schoenheimer and his associates&#x27; theories that plant sterols were not absorbable were probable.  Furthur studies were conducted and the findings concluded that plant sterols were non-absorbable, and therefore animals with plant only diets must synthesise the cholesterol necessary for their tissues as they do not receive absorbable cholesterol. During this period Schoenheimer became aware that cholesterol had an intermediary metabolism and that it was chemically inconvertable with other sterols. In one of his later experiments using sterols, he did discover a small percentage of one sterol, dihydrocholesterol in animal tissue. He investigated this finding using a dog which showed dihydrocholesterol was formed in the tissues. This finding revealed to Schoenheimer that cholesterol was an active metabolite. Schoenheimer and his associates also investigated ergo-sterol, and its behaviour within the bodies of rats, mice, and rabbits. The findings of this study revealed that egro-sterol was not absorbable. This research shaped Schoenheimer&#x27;s scientific career and research path.

===Later work: 1933-1941===

In 1933, Schoenheimer emigrated to the United States, where his scientific research took a different focus. Prior to his emigration, his work was mostly focused on the metabolism of cholesterol. In 1934 Schoenheimer began his work on intermediary metabolism, and how stable isotopes could be applied to the study. Schoenheimer worked alongside David Rittenburg and later Konrad Bloch. Schoenheimer and his colleagues began their research by conducting experiments with the use of deuterium. Deuterium, which is a stable isotope of hydrogen, was discovered by physical chemist Harold Urey in 1932. One of the methods used in the experiment involved heavy water administered into animals in order to analyse the deuterium present in the different constituents of the body. This suggested which type of substances were utilising the hydrogen present in body fluids and revealed the role water posed in metabolic processes. Their experiment also provided information regarding the breakdown process of lipid compounds containing deuterium in experimental animals. Prior to this study, it was assumed that animals utilised fats directly from foods that they had recently ingested, and that fat stores were only used amid starvation. The experiment revealed that fatty acids remained stored in body depots even during starvation.  

Schoenheimer and his colleagues then began a study of protein metabolism using the isotope of nitrogen as it became available. Schoenheimer and his colleague David Rittenberg, analysed how synthesised amino acids containing nitrogen would operate within an animal&#x27;s body. They used adult rats as the subject of their experiment and added amino acids synthesised from isotopic ammonia to their diet. When these diets were applied in nitrogen equilibrium it was found they were incorporated into tissue proteins at an intensive and rapid rate.  There was also evidence of chemical transformation as heavy nitrogen was present in amino acids, which were isolated from protein, following ingestion. This chemical transformation was similar to that demonstrated in the fatty acids of his previous experiments on intermediary metabolism. The results of the experiment revealed that body proteins are in a continuous and dynamic state of synthesis and degradation. Schoenheimer and Rittenberg were responsible for discovering that body constituents were in a state of constant chemical renewal, as they were previously believed to be in a static state. Experiments on the metabolism of amino acids, fatty acids, and excretory products are used to support and demonstrate this concept of metabolic &quot;regeneration&quot;. These molecules go through a process of replacement and interchange in the body tissue, as well as other transformations and fundamental chemical reactions. This method of isotope labelling molecules enabled Schoenheimer and his colleagues to investigate various issues in intermediary metabolism.

By the late 1930s, Schoenheimer&#x27;s work had contributed to the rising interest in intermediary metabolism and the isotope method.

==Later life and death==
Schoenheimer had married Salome Glucksohn, a noted zoologist and geneticist, in 1937. They emigrated to the United States together, and they had no children. They later divorced. Schoenheimer was invited to conduct lectures detailing his scientific work and findings. In 1937, he conducted his Harvey Lecture and in 1941 his Dunham Lecture was conducted by his colleagues in his behalf. At the height of his career he committed suicide by ingesting potassium cyanide at his home in Yonkers, having struggled with depression for multiple years.

==Use of Schoenheimer&#x27;s scientific findings==
Schoenheimer&#x27;s scientific work and his development of isotope tagging techniques enabled biochemists to discover the various metabolic pathways of the body.

Schoenheimer was among the first scientists to identify that the bodies of humans and animals had processes of renewal and regeneration. The methods and techniques used by Schoenheimer also provided a means to measure quantities of substances within the body prior to the advent of the technologies and software for dynamic modeling.

Schoenheimer&#x27;s 1933 metabolic balance study in animals presented early evidence of &quot;end-product feedback inhibition of cholesterol synthesis&quot;. In later years, with greater advancements in science and technology, including the advent of radioactive isotopes, greater information on cholesterol feedback was discovered.

<text>New Milford is a town in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town, part of Greater Danbury, as well as the New York Metropolitan Area, has a population of 28,115 as of the 2020 census. New Milford lies north of Danbury on the banks of the Housatonic River, and shares its border with the northeastern shore of Candlewood Lake. It is the largest town in the state of Connecticut in terms of land area at nearly 63.7 mi2 (164.9822 km). The town center is listed as a census-designated place (CDP).

New Milford is located roughly west of Hartford, northeast of New York City proper, and 80 miles from Midtown Manhattan.

New Milford consists of a number of town sub-divisions ( boroughs, districts, communities, or neighborhoods), including Gaylordsville, Merryall, and Northville. The town&#x27;s infrastructure largely branches off of either side of the highway routes U.S. 7 and U.S. 202, which intersect and split within the town and together form its main thoroughfare.

The area constituting contemporary New Milford was originally inhabited by the indigenous Wawyachtonoc people, while the town of New Milford itself was formally established by English colonists in the early 18th century.

==History==

=== Native Americans ===
The indigenous Wawyachtonoc people were a sub-group of the Paugussett Nation, and later a Mahican-affiliated Native American tribe, that lived in the area of contemporary New Milford both before and during the colonial era. They had a farming and fishing culture, cultivating corn—mainly by the Housatonic and Still rivers—squash, beans and tobacco, and fished in freshwater areas. They spoke an Algonquian language. The Wawyachtonoc&#x27;s primary village, &quot;Weantinock&quot;, was located near present-day New Milford, along the Housatonic River.

===Colonial times===
In 1707, John Noble Sr., previously of Westfield, Massachusetts, and his eight-year-old daughter Sarah Noble were the first Anglo-American settlers. (A public school was later named after Sarah Noble.) They were soon joined by others who had bought land there.

On October 17, 1711, twelve families (including a total about 70 people) petitioned the Connecticut General Assembly to create the town, together with the associated privilege of levying a tax to support a minister. With the legislature&#x27;s approval, the town was organized the next year. The residents soon secured Daniel Boardman to preach, and he was ordained as the minister of the Congregational Church on November 21, 1716.

In 1722, most of northwestern Connecticut (except for the town of Litchfield) was placed under the jurisdiction of New Haven County. In 1730, the eastern half of northwestern Connecticut was transferred to the jurisdiction of Hartford County. But New Milford, Salisbury and Sharon continued in New Haven County until the formation of Litchfield County in 1751.

===American Revolution===
Roger Sherman lived in New Milford before moving to New Haven in 1761. He later became a member of the Continental Congress and signed both the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. The lot of his former house is the site of the present Town Hall.

During the American Revolution, the 7th Connecticut Regiment (also known as the 19th Continental Regiment) was raised in town on September 16, 1776. The regiment, and the New Milford men in it, would see action in the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown and the Battle of Monmouth. In total, the town &quot;sent 285 men to fight in the War out of a total population of 2,776.&quot;

===The Boardman family===
* David Sherman Boardman (1768–1864) was the youngest child of Deacon Sherman and Sarah (Bostwick) Boardman. He became a lawyer in town and later chief judge in Litchfield County Court. He served as judge of probate for the district of New Milford in 1805, and held the place by successive annual appointments for sixteen years. He was elected Representative to the General Assembly eight times.
* Elijah Boardman (1760–1823) was a U.S. senator representing Connecticut. Born in New Milford, he was educated by private tutors, and served in the Revolutionary War.
* William Whiting Boardman (1794–1871), a U.S. Representative born in town, was the son of Elijah Boardman. He was a Connecticut state senator in the fourth district, 1830–32, a member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives, 1836–1839, 1845, and 1849–1851; Speaker of the Connecticut State House of Representatives, 1836, 1839, and 1845; US Representative from Connecticut&#x27;s second district, 1840–1843. He died in New Haven, and is interred at Grove Street Cemetery in New Milford.

===19th and 20th centuries===
During the early- to mid-19th century, New Milford was home to several locations that were part of the Underground Railroad network. 

In the second half of the 19th century, many new industries came to town. The Water Witch Hose Company No. 2, local telephone and electricity companies, and newspapers were all founded. Factories in town made buttons, paint and varnish, hats, furniture, pottery, lime, dairy products and pasteboard, among other goods. Tobacco became the major crop in the area, and tobacco warehouses sprang up to handle its storage and processing before sales.

In 1942 Buck&#x27;s Rock Camp was founded off Bucks Rock Road, and has remained in operation ever since.

The house that inspired the 1946 novel and 1948 film, &quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot;, still stands in the Merryall section of town.

===21st century===
The town has constructed a 1,000,000-gallon sewer plant expansion on West Street, a sewer pump station on Boardman Road, reconstruction of the Rte. 67/ Grove Street Intersection, and ambulance facility on Scovill Street.

The town has added a skate park at Young&#x27;s Field (2006), reconstructed the tennis and basketball courts at Young&#x27;s Field (2010), reconstructed the basketball court at Williamson Park in Gaylordsville (2010), and improved Lynn Deming Park (2017), and is working on the New Milford River Trail, which will eventually join the existing 1.5-mile Sega Meadows Park trail (2012), 3.5 miles of River Road, and the 0.25-mile Young&#x27;s Field River Trail (2017) and link them to the greenways in the neighboring towns of Brookfield and Kent. Several streetscape projects were completed by the Department of Public Works (DPW) with grant money on Church Street, Whittlesey Avenue, and the west side of East Street (2009/2010). Candlewoof Dog Park is completed on Pickett District Road. A bocce ball court was constructed at the Senior Center by Boy Scout Troop 66 (2012).

New Milford is frequented on weekends between the months of April and December, when visitors attend the Elephant&#x27;s Trunk Flea Market, a large outdoor flea market located near the southern end of the town which WRKI has claimed is the largest weekly flea market in New England.

The trend of town population growth has continued but slowed since the beginning of the 21st century.

There has been continued talk about a proposal to electrify and restore the Danbury Branch of the Metro-North Railroad north of Danbury to New Milford. These efforts have included a Rail Study in 2008, proposed state legislation in 2017, and stimulus money in 2021. The Danbury Branch provides commuter rail service between Danbury, to South Norwalk, Stamford, and Grand Central Terminal in New York City. The tracks north of Danbury are currently used by the Housatonic Railroad for freight service.

<doc id="669683" wikidata="Q4749965" url="?curid=669683" title="An Evening with Kevin Smith">
<text>An Evening with Kevin Smith is a DVD featuring question and answer sessions that the comedian and filmmaker Kevin Smith held with his fans at various American colleges in 2001/2002. The colleges were: Clark University, Cornell University, Indiana University, Kent State University and University of Wyoming. During the sessions, Smith answers questions regarding his movies, as well as his life. He discusses how he got started in the movie industry, how different films came about, his friendship with Jason Mewes, and his relationship with the media, fans, and various other celebrities.

==Plot==
The film features numerous comedic stories from Smith&#x27;s life at that point in his early 30s. Smith first unearthed stories such as his relationship with Warner Bros. and their famously unreleased &quot;Superman Lives&quot;. The story became the basis for a 2015 documentary. The story Smith tells involves producer Jon Peters wanting to include elements of generic blockbuster cliché in Smith&#x27;s script, these include Superman fighting a large spider, a story point later included in Peters&#x27; box office bomb &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;.

Another story Smith recalls is of when he first met his future wife (Jennifer Schwalbach Smith) whilst promoting &quot;Dogma&quot; in 1999 and the birth of his daughter that same year. Smith tells of how he was physically injured the night he first slept with his wife, a fact he never told her until a full year into their marriage.

One of Smith&#x27;s most popular stories from the DVD is of when he was unknowingly forced to make a near 5-hour long documentary for Prince about God and the evolution of man, both of which are two topics Smith has little to no involvement in. Smith reveals he was angry with the pop star towards the end of the week he spent with him, especially when he learns of the documentary never seeing the light of day, instead being put into Prince&#x27;s vault which includes over 100 original music videos and hundreds of hours of music previously unreleased according to Smith.

==Release==
The film was originally released on DVD on December 17, 2002.

In 2021, full HD shots from the film were seen in Malcolm Ingram&#x27;s &quot;Clerk&quot; documentary. In 2022, the film became available on Canadian television network CTV&#x27;s VOD service for the first time in 720p HD. On July 24, 2024, it was announced that Sony MOD would be releasing the film on Bluray for the first time on September 10, 2024. That release was ultimately cancelled, and no further details were provided.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 100% rating with 6 positive reviews collected. 
Joel Cunningham, writing for Digitally Obsessed, stated that the DVD was &quot;essential viewing for any true fan of Jay and Silent Bob&quot; and complimented Smith&#x27;s abilities as a story teller. Adam Tyner of DVD Talk ranked &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot; as &quot;highly recommended&quot; though he noted that &quot;at least &quot;some&quot; familiarity with Kevin Smith and his body of work is required to get much out of this two-disc set.&quot;

<text>The British Film Institute (BFI) is a film and television charitable organisation which promotes and preserves film-making and television in the United Kingdom. The BFI uses funds provided by the National Lottery to encourage film production, distribution, and education. It is sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and partially funded under the British Film Institute Act 1949.

==Purpose==

The BFI was established in 1933 to encourage the development of the arts of film, television and the moving image throughout the United Kingdom, to promote their use as a record of contemporary life and manners, to promote education about film, television and the moving image generally, and their impact on society, to promote access to and appreciation of the widest possible range of British and world cinema and to establish, care for and develop collections reflecting the moving image history and heritage of the United Kingdom.

== BFI activities ==

=== Archive ===
The BFI maintains the world&#x27;s largest film archive, the BFI National Archive, previously called National Film Library (1935–1955), National Film Archive (1955–1992), and National Film and Television Archive (1993–2006). The archive contains more than 50,000 fiction films, over 100,000 non-fiction titles, and around 625,000 television programmes. The majority of the collection is British material but it also features internationally significant holdings from around the world. The Archive also collects films which feature key British actors and the work of British directors.

=== Cinemas ===

The BFI runs the BFI Southbank (formerly the National Film Theatre (NFT)) and the BFI IMAX cinema, both located on the south bank of the River Thames in London. The IMAX has the largest cinema screen in the UK and shows popular recent releases and short films showcasing its technology, which includes IMAX 70mm screenings, IMAX 3D screenings and 11,600 watts of digital surround sound. BFI Southbank shows films from all over the world, particularly critically acclaimed historical and specialised films that may not otherwise get a cinema showing. The BFI also distributes archival and cultural cinema to other venues – each year to more than 800 venues all across the UK, as well as to a substantial number of overseas venues.

=== Education ===
The BFI offers a range of education initiatives, in particular to support the teaching of film and media studies in schools. In late 2012, the BFI received money from the Department for Education to create the BFI Film Academy Network for young people aged between 16 and 25. A residential scheme is held at the NFTS every year.

=== Festivals ===
The BFI runs the annual London Film Festival along with BFI Flare: London LGBT Film Festival and the youth-orientated Future Film Festival.

=== Other activities ===

The BFI publishes the monthly &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine, as well as films on Blu-ray, DVD and books. It runs the BFI National Library (a reference library), and maintains the BFI Film &amp; TV Database and Summary of Information on Film and Television (SIFT), which are databases of credits, synopses and other information about film and television productions. SIFT has a collection of about 7 million still frames from film and television.

The BFI has co-produced a number of television series featuring footage from the BFI National Archive, in partnership with the BBC, including &quot;The Lost World of Mitchell &amp; Kenyon&quot;, &quot;The Lost World of Friese-Greene&quot; and &quot;The Lost World of Tibet&quot;.

The BFI has also produced contemporary artists&#x27; moving image work, most notably through the programme of the BFI Gallery, which was located at BFI Southbank from March 2007 to March 2011. The programme of the gallery resulted in several new commissions by leading artists, including projects which engaged directly with the BFI National Archive, among which are Patrick Keiller&#x27;s &#x27;The City of the Future&#x27;, Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard&#x27;s &#x27;RadioMania: An Abandoned Work&#x27; and Deimantas Narkevicious&#x27; &#x27;Into the Unknown&#x27;. The Gallery also initiated projects by film-makers such as Michael Snow, Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Jane and Louise Wilson and John Akomfrah.

The BFI also operates a streaming service called BFI Player. This streaming service offers a variety of niche and art films.

== Organisation ==

=== History ===
The institute was founded in 1933. Despite its foundation resulting from a recommendation in a report on &quot;Film in National Life&quot;, at that time the institute was a private company, though it has received public money throughout its history. This came from the Privy Council and Treasury until 1965, and from the various culture departments since then.

The institute was restructured following the Radcliffe Report of 1948, which recommended that it should concentrate on developing the appreciation of filmic art, rather than creating film itself. Thus control of educational film production passed to the National Committee for Visual Aids in Education and the British Film Academy assumed control for promoting production. From 1952 to 2000, the BFI provided funding for new and experimental film-makers via the BFI Production Board.

The institute received a royal charter in 1983. This was updated in 2000, and in the same year the newly established UK Film Council took responsibility for providing the BFI&#x27;s annual grant-in-aid (government subsidy). As an independent registered charity, the BFI is regulated by the Charity Commission and the Privy Council.

In 1988, the BFI opened the London Museum of the Moving Image (MOMI) on the South Bank. MOMI was acclaimed internationally and set new standards for education through entertainment, but it did not receive the high levels of continuing investment that might have enabled it to keep pace with technological developments and ever-rising audience expectations. The museum was &quot;temporarily&quot; closed in 1999 when the BFI stated that it would be re-sited. This did not happen, and MOMI&#x27;s closure became permanent in 2002 when it was decided to redevelop the South Bank site. This redevelopment was itself then further delayed.

=== Today ===
The BFI is currently managed on a day-to-day basis by its chief executive, Ben Roberts. Supreme decision-making authority rests with a chair and a board of up to 15 governors. The current chair is Jay Hunt, a television executive, who took up the post in February 2024. Governors, including the Chair, are appointed by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

The BFI operates with three sources of income. The largest is public money allocated by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. For the year 2021–22, the BFI received £74.31m from the DCMS as Grant-in-Aid funding. The second largest source is commercial activity such as receipts from ticket sales at BFI Southbank or the BFI London IMAX theatre (£5m in 2007), sales of DVDs, etc. Thirdly, grants and sponsorship of around £5m are obtained from various sources, including National Lottery funding grants, private sponsors and through donations (J. Paul Getty, Jr., who died in 2003, left the BFI a legacy of around £1m in his will). The BFI is also the distributor for all Lottery funds for film (in 2011–12 this amounted to c.£25m).

As well as its work on film, the BFI also devotes a large amount of its time to the preservation and study of British television programming and its history. In 2000, it published a high-profile list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, as voted for by a range of industry figures.

The delayed redevelopment of the National Film Theatre finally took place in 2007, creating in the rebranded &quot;BFI Southbank&quot; new education spaces, a contemporary art gallery dedicated to the moving image (the BFI Gallery), and a pioneering mediatheque which for the first time enabled the public to gain access, free of charge, to some of the otherwise inaccessible treasures in the National Film &amp; Television Archive. The mediatheque has proved to be the most successful element of this redevelopment, and there are plans to roll out a network of them across the UK.

An announcement of a £25 million capital investment in the Strategy for UK Screen Heritage was made by Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport at the opening night of the 2007 London Film Festival. The bulk of this money paid for long overdue development of the BFI National Archive facilities in Hertfordshire and Warwickshire.

During 2009, the UK Film Council persuaded the government that there should only be one main public-funded body for film, and that body should be the UKFC, while the BFI should be abolished. In 2010, the government announced that there would be a single body for film. Despite intensive lobbying (including, controversially, using public funding to pay public relations agencies to put its case forward), the UKFC failed to persuade the government that it should have that role and, instead, the BFI took over most of the UKFC&#x27;s functions and funding from 1 April 2011, with the UKFC being subsequently abolished. Since then, the BFI has been responsible for all Lottery funding for film—originally in excess of £25m p.a., and currently in excess of £40m p.a.

The BFI Film Academy forms part of the BFI&#x27;s overall 5–19 Education Scheme. The programme is being supported by the Department for Education in England who have committed £1m per annum funding from April 2012 and 31 March 2015. It is also funded through the National Lottery, Creative Scotland and Northern Ireland Screen.

On 29 November 2016, the BFI announced that over 100,000 television programmes are to be digitised before the video tapes, which currently have an estimated five-to-six-year shelf life, become unusable. The BFI aims to make sure that the television archive is still there in 200 years&#x27; time.

The BFI announced in February 2021 that it is teaming up with American diversity and inclusion program #StartWith8Hollywood founded by Thuc Doan Nguyen to make it global.

The BFI is currently chaired by Jay Hunt and run by CEO Ben Roberts and deputy CEO Harriet Finney.

<doc id="669691" wikidata="Q622380" url="?curid=669691" title="Pather Panchali">
<text> (, ) is a 1955 Indian Bengali-language drama film written and directed by Satyajit Ray in his directoral debut and produced by the Government of West Bengal. It is an adaptation of Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay&#x27;s 1929 Bengali novel of the same name and features Subir Banerjee, Kanu Banerjee, Karuna Banerjee, Uma Dasgupta, and Chunibala Devi in major roles. The first film in &quot;The Apu Trilogy&quot;, depicts the childhood travails of the protagonist Apu and his elder sister Durga amid the harsh village life of their poor family.

The film was shot mainly on location, had a limited budget, featured mostly amateur actors, and was made by an inexperienced crew. Lack of funds led to frequent interruptions in production, which took nearly three years, but the West Bengal government pulled Ray out of debt by buying the film for the equivalent of $60,000, which it turned into a profit of $700,000 by 1980. The sitar player Ravi Shankar composed the film&#x27;s soundtrack and score using classical Indian ragas. Subrata Mitra was in charge of the cinematography while editing was handled by Dulal Dutta. Following its premiere on 3 May 1955 during an exhibition at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, &quot;Pather Panchali&quot; was released in Calcutta the same year to an enthusiastic reception. A special screening was attended by the Chief Minister of West Bengal and the Prime Minister of India. 

Critics have praised its realism, humanity, and soul-stirring qualities, while others have called its slow pace a drawback, and some have condemned it for romanticising poverty. Scholars have commented on the film&#x27;s quality and realism (influenced by Italian neorealism), its portrayal of the poverty and small delights of daily life, and the use of what the author Darius Cooper has termed the &quot;epiphany of wonder&quot;, among other themes.

The tale of Apu&#x27;s life is continued in the two subsequent installments of Ray&#x27;s trilogy: &quot;Aparajito&quot; (&quot;The Unvanquished&quot;, 1956) and &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;, 1959). is described as a turning point in Indian cinema, as it was among the films that pioneered the Parallel cinema movement, which espoused authenticity and social realism. The first film from independent India to attract major international critical attention, it won India&#x27;s National Film Award for Best Feature Film in 1955, the Best Human Document award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, and several other awards, establishing Ray as one of the country&#x27;s most distinguished filmmakers. It is often featured in lists of the greatest films ever made.

==Plot==
In the late-1910s in Nischindipur, rural Bengal, Harihar Roy earns a meagre living as a &quot;pujari&quot; (priest) but dreams of a better career as a poet and playwright. His wife Sarbajaya cares for their children, Durga and Apu, and Harihar&#x27;s elderly cousin, Indir Thakrun. Because of their limited resources, Sarbajaya resents having to share her home with the old Indir, who often steals food from their already bare kitchen. Durga is fond of Indir and often gives her fruit stolen from a wealthy neighbour&#x27;s orchard. One day, the neighbour&#x27;s wife accuses Durga of stealing a bead necklace (which Durga denies) and blames Sarbajaya for encouraging her tendency to steal.

As the elder sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection but spares no opportunity to tease him. Together, they share life&#x27;s simple joys: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor&#x27;s bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through, and watching a &quot;jatra&quot; (folk theatre) performed by an acting troupe. Every evening, they are delighted by the sound of a distant train&#x27;s whistle.

Sarbajaya grows increasingly resentful of Indir and becomes more openly hostile, which causes Indir to take temporary refuge in the home of another relative. One day, while Durga and Apu run to catch a glimpse of the train, Indir—who is feeling unwell—goes back home, and the children find she has passed away upon their return.

With prospects drying up in the village, Harihar travels to the city to seek a better job. He promises that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house, but is gone longer than expected. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty, and Sarbajaya grows increasingly desperate and anxious. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Her condition worsens as a thunderstorm batters the crumbling house with rain and wind, and she dies the next morning.

Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. A silent Sarbajaya breaks down at her husband&#x27;s feet, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that Durga has died. The family decide to leave their ancestral home for Benaras. As they pack, Apu finds the necklace Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart, while a snake is seen slithering into their now barren house.

===Novel and title===

Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay&#x27;s novel is a classic bildungsroman (a type of coming-of-age story) in the canon of Bengali literature. It first appeared as a serial in a Calcutta periodical in 1928, and was published as a book the next year. The novel depicts a poor family&#x27;s struggle to survive in their rural ancestral home and the growing up of Apu, the son of the family. The later part of the novel, where Apu and his parents leave their village and settle in Benaras, formed the basis of &quot;Aparajito&quot; (&quot;The Unvanquished&quot;, 1956), the second film of the Apu trilogy.

Satyajit Ray (2 May 1921 – 23 April 1992), working as a graphic designer for Signet Press, created the illustrations for an abridged edition of the book in 1944. At that time, Ray read the unabridged novel; Signet&#x27;s owner D. K. Gupta told Ray that the abridged version would make a great film. The idea appealed to Ray, and around 1946–47, when he considered making a film, he turned to because of certain qualities that &quot;made it a great book: its humanism, its lyricism, and its ring of truth&quot;. The author&#x27;s widow permitted Ray to make a film based on the novel; the agreement was in principle only, and no financial arrangement was made.

The Bengali word &quot;path&quot; literally means path, and &quot;pather&quot; means &quot;of the path&quot;. &quot;Panchali&quot; is a type of narrative folk song that used to be performed in Bengal and was the forerunner of another type of folk performance, the &quot;jatra&quot;. English translations of the Bengali title include &quot;Song of the Little Road&quot;, &quot;The Lament of the Path&quot;, &quot;Song of the Road&quot;, and &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot;.

===Script===

 did not have a script; it was made from Ray&#x27;s drawings and notes. Ray completed the first draft of the notes during his sea voyage to and from London in 1950. Before principal photography began, he created a storyboard dealing with details and continuity. Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to Cinémathèque Française.

In &quot;Apur Panchali&quot; (the Bengali translation of &quot;My Years with Apu: A Memoir&quot;, 1994), Ray wrote that he had omitted many of the novel&#x27;s characters and that he had rearranged some of its sequences to make the narrative better as cinema. Changes include Indir&#x27;s death, which occurs early in the novel at a village shrine in the presence of adults, while in the film Apu and Durga find her corpse in the open. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not in the novel, in which neither child sees the train, although they try. Durga&#x27;s fatal fever is attributed to a monsoon downpour in the film, but is unexplained in the novel. The ending of the film—the family&#x27;s departure from the village—is not the end of the novel.

Ray tried to extract a simple theme from the random sequences of significant and trivial episodes of the novel, while preserving what W. Andrew Robinson describes as the &quot;loitering impression&quot; it creates. According to Ray, &quot;the script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the feel of authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble&quot;. For Robinson, Ray&#x27;s adaptation focuses mainly on Apu and his family, while Bandopadhyay&#x27;s original featured greater detail about village life in general.

===Casting===
Kanu Banerjee (who plays Harihar) was an established Bengali film actor. Karuna Banerjee (Sarbajaya) was an amateur actress from the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association, and the wife of Ray&#x27;s friend. Uma Dasgupta, who successfully auditioned for the part of Durga, also had prior theatre experience.

For the role of Apu, Ray advertised in newspapers for boys of ages five to seven. None of the candidates who auditioned fulfilled Ray&#x27;s expectations, but his wife spotted a boy in their neighbourhood, and this boy, Subir Banerjee, was cast as Apu. The surname of three of the main actors and two supporting actors happened to be Banerjee, but they were not related to each other. The hardest role to fill was the wizened old Indir. Ray eventually found Chunibala Devi, a retired stage actress living in one of Calcutta&#x27;s red-light districts, as the ideal candidate. Several minor roles were played by the villagers of Boral, where was filmed.

===Filming===

Shooting started on 27 October 1952. Boral, a village near Calcutta, was selected in early 1953 as the main location for principal photography, and night scenes were shot in-studio. The technical team included several first-timers, including Ray himself and cinematographer Subrata Mitra, who had never operated a film camera. Art director Bansi Chandragupta had professional experience, having worked with Jean Renoir on &quot;The River&quot; (1951). Both Mitra and Chandragupta went on to establish themselves as respected professionals.

Mitra had met Ray on the set of &quot;The River&quot;, where Mitra was allowed to observe the production, take photographs and make notes about lighting for personal reference. Having become friends, Mitra kept Ray informed about the production and showed his photographs. Ray was impressed enough by them to promise him an assistant&#x27;s position on , and when production neared, invited him to shoot the film. As the 21-year-old Mitra had no prior filmmaking experience, the choice was met with scepticism by those who knew of the production. Mitra himself later speculated that Ray was nervous about working with an established crew.

Funding was a problem from the outset. No producer was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray&#x27;s plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted author Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay&#x27;s widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, a well-established director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.

Ray thus had to borrow money to shoot enough footage to persuade prospective producers to finance the whole film. To raise funds, he continued to work as a graphic designer, pawned his life insurance policy and sold his collection of gramophone records. Production manager Anil Chowdhury convinced Ray&#x27;s wife, Bijoya, to pawn her jewels. Ray still ran out of money partway through filming, which had to be suspended for nearly a year. Thereafter shooting was done only in intermittent bursts. Ray later admitted that the delays had made him tense and that three miracles saved the film: &quot;One, Apu&#x27;s voice did not break. Two, Durga did not grow up. Three, Indir Thakrun did not die&quot;.

Bidhan Chandra Roy, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, was requested by an influential friend of Ray&#x27;s mother to help the production. The Chief Minister obliged, and government officials saw the footage. The Home Publicity Department of the West Bengal government assessed the cost of backing the film and sanctioned a loan, given in instalments, allowing Ray to finish production. The government misunderstood the nature of the film, believing it to be a documentary for rural uplift, and recorded the loan as being for &quot;roads improvement&quot;, a reference to the film&#x27;s title.

Monroe Wheeler, head of the department of exhibitions and publications at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), who was in Calcutta in 1954, heard about the project and met Ray. He considered the incomplete footage to be of very high quality and encouraged Ray to finish the film so that it could be shown at a MoMA exhibition the following year. Six months later, American director John Huston visited India for some early location scouting for &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (eventually made in 1975). Wheeler had asked Huston to check the progress of Ray&#x27;s project. Huston saw excerpts of the unfinished film and recognised &quot;the work of a great film-maker&quot;. Because of Huston&#x27;s positive feedback, MoMA helped Ray with additional money.

Including the delays and hiatuses in production, it took three years to complete the shooting of .

==Influences==

The realist narrative style of was influenced by Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film &quot;The River&quot; (1951). Ray, a founding member of the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film , Renoir encouraged him to proceed. In 1950 Ray was sent to London by his employer, the advertising agency D.J. Keymer, to work at their headquarters. During his six months in London, he watched about 100 films. Among these, Vittorio De Sica&#x27;s neorealist film &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (1948) had a profound impact on him. In a 1982 lecture, Ray said that he had come out of the theatre determined to become a filmmaker. The film made him believe that it was possible to make realistic cinema that was shot on location with an amateur cast.

The international success of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s Japanese film &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) and Bimal Roy&#x27;s 1953 Hindi film &quot;Do Bigha Zamin&quot; (which was shot partly on location and was about a peasant family) led Ray to believe that would find an international audience. Ray also had more indigenous influences, such as Bengali literature and the native Indian theatrical tradition, particularly the &quot;rasa&quot; theory of classical Sanskrit drama. Darius Cooper describes the complicated doctrine of &quot;rasa&quot; as &quot; predominantly on feelings experienced not only by the characters but also conveyed in a certain artistic way to the spectator&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack of the film was composed by the sitar player Ravi Shankar, who was at an early stage of his career, having debuted in 1939. The background scores feature pieces based on several ragas of Indian classical music, played mostly on the sitar. The soundtrack, described in a 1995 issue of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; as &quot;at once plaintive and exhilarating&quot;, is featured in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s 2007 list of 50 greatest film soundtracks. It has also been cited as an influence on The Beatles, specifically George Harrison.

Shankar saw about half the film in a roughly edited version before composing the background score, but he was already familiar with the story. According to Robinson, when Ray met Shankar the latter hummed a tune that was folk-based but had &quot;a certain sophistication&quot;. This tune, usually played on a bamboo flute, became the main theme for the film. The majority of the score was composed within the duration of a single night, in a session that lasted for about eleven hours. Shankar also composed two solo sitar pieces—one based on the raga &quot;Desh&quot; (traditionally associated with rain), and one sombre piece based on the raga &quot;Todi&quot;. He created a piece based on the raga &quot;Patdeep&quot;, played on the tar shehnai, by Dakshina Mohan Tagore to accompany the scene in which Harihar learns of Durga&#x27;s death. The film&#x27;s cinematographer, Subrata Mitra, performed on the sitar for parts of the soundtrack.

==Release and reception==

Ray and his crew worked long hours on post-production, managing to submit it just in time for Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s &quot;Textiles and Ornamental Arts of India&quot; exhibition of May 1955. The film, billed as &quot;The Story of Apu and Durga&quot;, lacked subtitles. It was one of a series of six evening performances at MoMA, including the US debut of sarod player Ali Akbar Khan and the classical dancer Shanta Rao. ″s MoMA opening on 3 May was well received. A film still of Apu having his hair brushed by his sister Durga and mother Sarbojaya was featured in &quot;The Family of Man&quot;, a 1955 MoMA exhibition.

 had its domestic premiere at the annual meeting of the Advertising Club of Calcutta; the response there was not positive, and Ray felt &quot;extremely discouraged&quot;. Before its theatrical release in Calcutta, Ray designed large posters, including a neon sign showing Apu and Durga running, which was strategically placed in a busy location in the city. was released in Basusree, a Calcutta cinema on 26 August 1955 and received a poor initial response. The screenings started filling up within a week or two, buoyed by word of mouth. It opened again at another cinema, where it ran for seven weeks. A delay in subtitling led to the postponement of the UK release until December 1957. It went on to achieve great success in the US in 1958, running for eight months at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse in New York. It was a record run for the Fifth Avenue cinema. The Bengali government earned a profit of $50,000 from its initial US release, and decades later the film grossed $402,723 from its 2015 limited release. The film reportedly grossed an estimated total of () at the worldwide box office, .

In India the film&#x27;s reception was enthusiastic. &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote: &quot;It is absurd to compare it with any other Indian cinema... is pure cinema&quot;. Chief Minister Roy arranged a special screening in Calcutta for Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who came out of the theatre impressed. Despite opposition from some within the governments of West Bengal and India because of its depiction of poverty, was sent to the 1956 Cannes Film Festival with Nehru&#x27;s personal approval. It was screened towards the end of the festival, coinciding with a party given by the Japanese delegation, and only a small number of critics attended. Although some were initially unenthusiastic at the prospect of yet another Indian melodrama, the film critic Arturo Lanocita found &quot;the magic horse of poetry... invading the screen&quot;. was subsequently named Best Human Document at the festival.

Lindsay Anderson commented after the Cannes screening that had &quot;the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience&quot;. In subsequent years, critics have given positive reviews. A 1958 review in &quot;Time&quot; described as &quot;perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since Robert Flaherty&#x27;s &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;&quot;. In her 1982 book &quot;5001 Nights at the Movies&quot;, Pauline Kael wrote: &quot;Beautiful, sometimes funny, and full of love, it brought a new vision of India to the screen&quot;. Basil Wright considered it &quot;a new and incontrovertible work of art&quot;. James Berardinelli wrote in 1996 that the film &quot;touches the souls and minds of viewers, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers&quot;. In 2006 Philip French of &quot;The Observer&quot; called it &quot;one of the greatest pictures ever made&quot;. Twenty years after the release of , Akira Kurosawa summarised the effect of the film as overwhelming and lauded its ability &quot;to stir up deep passions&quot;.

The reaction was not uniformly positive. On seeing the film, François Truffaut is reported to have said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands&quot;. Bosley Crowther, the most influential critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote in 1958, &quot;any picture as loose in structure or as listless in tempo as this one is would barely pass as a &#x27;rough cut&#x27; with the editors in Hollywood&quot;, even though he praised its gradually emerging poignancy and poetic quality. &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; argued in 1959 that its fragmentary nature &quot;contributes to the film&#x27;s great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention. For , remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through&quot;. Early in the 1980s, Ray was criticised by Nargis Dutt, an Indian parliamentarian and former actress, for &quot;exporting poverty&quot;. Darius Cooper writes that while many critics celebrated the Apu trilogy &quot;as a eulogy of third-world culture, others criticized it for what they took to be its romanticization of such a culture&quot;. Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote that &quot;its story is simple almost to the point of banality, it is rewarding if taken as a dramatized documentary&quot;.

As of May 2021, the film has a 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on an aggregate of 69 reviews with an average score of 9.3/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A film that requires and rewards patience in equal measure, finds director Satyajit Ray delivering a classic with his debut&quot;. In 2018 the film earned the 15th spot when BBC released the top 100 foreign language films ever, and filmmaker Christopher Nolan called it &quot;one of the best films ever made&quot;.

===1990s restoration===
In the 1990s, Merchant Ivory Productions, with assistance from the Academy Film Archive and Sony Pictures Classics, undertook a project to restore the prints. The restored prints, along with several other Ray films, were released in select US theatres. is available in DVD in Region 2 (DVD region code) PAL and Region 1 NTSC formats. Artificial Eye Entertainment is the distributor of Region 2 while Columbia Tri-Star is the distributor of Region 1 format.

===2015 restoration===
In 2013, the video distribution company The Criterion Collection, in collaboration with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences&#x27; Film Archive, began the restoration of the original negatives of the Apu trilogy, including . These negatives had been severely damaged by a fire in London in 1993, and all film cans and fragments belonging to the Ray films were sent to the Motion Picture Academy for storage, where they lay unseen for two decades. It was discovered upon re-examination that, although many parts of the films were indeed destroyed by fire or the effects of age, other parts were salvageable. The materials were shipped to a restoration laboratory in Bologna, Italy: L&#x27;Immagine Ritrovata. Over a thousand hours of labor by hand were expended in restoring and scanning the negatives and, in the end, about 40 percent of the negative was restored. For those parts of the negative that were missing or unusable, duplicate negatives and fine-grain masters from various commercial or archival sources were used. The Criterion Collection&#x27;s own lab then spent six months creating the digital version of all three films, at times choosing to preserve the distinctive look of the films even at the cost of retaining some imperfections.

On 4 May 2015, the restored premiered at the Museum of Modern Art, a little more than 60 years to the day after the film&#x27;s world premiere at the same venue. Several days later, all three films opened at New York&#x27;s Film Forum, where they were originally scheduled to run for three weeks. Because of overwhelming public demand – with one writer commenting that &quot;audiences can&#x27;t seem to get enough&quot; – the films were held over at that theater until 30 June. The trilogy was then sent to be exhibited in many other cities throughout the U.S. and Canada. The restoration work was widely acclaimed, with commentators calling the look of the restored films &quot;gorgeous&quot;, &quot;pristine&quot; and &quot;incredible&quot;.

==Themes==
Author Andrew Robinson, in the book &quot;The Apu Trilogy: Satyajit Ray and the Making of an Epic&quot; (2010), notes that it is challenging to narrate the plot of and the &quot;essence of the film lies in the ebb and flow of its human relationships and in its everyday details and cannot be reduced to a tale of events&quot;. In his 1958 &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Crowther writes that delicately illustrates how &quot;poverty does not always nullify love&quot; and how even very poor people can enjoy the little pleasures of their world. Marie Seton describes how the film intersperses the depiction of poverty and the delights and pleasures of youth. She represents the bond between Durga and Indir, and their fate, as signifying a philosophical core: that both the young and the old die. Seton writes of the film&#x27;s &quot;lyrical&quot; qualities, noting especially the imagery immediately before the onset of monsoon. Robinson writes about a peculiar quality of &quot;lyrical happiness&quot; in the film, and states that is &quot;about unsophisticated people shot through with great sophistication, and without a trace of condescension or inflated sentiment&quot;.

Darius Cooper discusses the use of different &quot;rasa&quot; in the film, observing Apu&#x27;s repeated &quot;epiphany of wonder&quot;, brought about not only by what the boy sees around him, but also when he uses his imagination to create another world. For Cooper, the immersive experience of the film corresponds to this epiphany of wonder. Stephen Teo uses the scene in which Apu and Durga discover railway tracks as an example of the gradual build-up of epiphany and the resulting immersive experience.

Sharmishtha Gooptu discusses the idea that the idyllic village life portrayed in represents authentic Bengali village life, which disappeared during the upheavals of Partition in 1947. She suggests that the film seeks to connect an idealised, pre-partition past with the actual present of partitioned Bengal, and that it uses prototypes of rural Bengal to construct an image of the ideal village. In contrast to this idealism, Mitali Pati and Suranjan Ganguly point out how Ray used eye-level shots, natural lighting, long takes and other techniques to achieve realism. Mainak Biswas has written that comes very close to the concept of Italian neorealism, as it has several passages with no dramatic development, even though the usual realities of life, such as the changing of seasons or the passing of a day, are concretely filmed.

==Legacy==
 was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu&#x27;s life—&quot;Aparajito&quot; (&quot;The Unvanquished&quot;) in 1956 and &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; (&quot;The World of Apu&quot;) in 1959. Together, the three films constitute the Apu trilogy. &quot;Aparajito&quot; portrays the adolescent Apu, his education in a rural school and a Calcutta college. Its central theme is the poignant relationship between a doting mother and her ambitious young son. &quot;Apur Sansar&quot; depicts Apu&#x27;s adult life, his reaction to his wife&#x27;s premature death, and his final bonding with his son whom he abandoned as an infant. The sequels also won many national and international awards. Ray did not initially plan to make a trilogy: he decided to make the third film only after being asked about the possibility of a trilogy at the 1957 Venice Film Festival, where &quot;Aparajito&quot; won the Golden Lion. &quot;Apur Panchali&quot; (2014) is a Bengali film directed by Kaushik Ganguly, which depicts the real-life story of Subir Bannerjee, the actor who portrayed Apu in . &quot;Aparajito&quot;, a 2022 Bengali film directed by Anik Dutta, tells the story of the making of .
 was the first film made in independent India to receive major critical attention internationally, placing India on the world cinema map. It was one of the first examples of Parallel Cinema, a new tradition of Indian film-making in which authenticity and social realism were key themes, breaking the rule of the Indian film establishment. Although was described as a turning point in Indian cinema, some commentators preferred the view that it refined a &quot;realist textual principle&quot; that was already there. In 1963 &quot;Time&quot; noted that thanks to , Satyajit Ray was one of the &quot;hardy little band of inspired pioneers&quot; of a new cinematic movement that was enjoying a good number of imitators worldwide. The film has since been considered as a &quot;global landmark&quot; and &quot;among the essential moviegoing experiences&quot;. On 2 May 2013, commemorating Ray&#x27;s birthday, the Indian version of the search engine Google displayed a doodle featuring the train sequence.

After , Ray went on to make 36 more films, including feature films, documentaries and shorts. He worked on scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, as was the case with , on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.

<text>In feudal law, nulle terre sans seigneur (French for &quot;no land without (a) lord&quot;, ) is the principle that one provides services to the sovereign (usually serving in his army) for the right to receive land from the sovereign. Originally a maxim of feudal law, it applies in modern form to paying rates or land tax for land of former feudal or feudal-like origin such as land with modern fee simple title, as opposed to land with allodial or udal title.

In the original French, the expression means &quot;No land without a lord&quot; though the legal sense might be more akin to &quot;no property without a liege&quot; since it was at the basis of the link between the infeodated or feal and his liege, in the feudal system.

<text>Disraeli Gears is the second studio album by the British rock band Cream. It was produced by Felix Pappalardi and released on Reaction Records. The album features the singles &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;.

The original 11-track album was remastered in 1998, and then subsequently released as a two-disc &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; in 2004.

==Production==
Early demo sessions for the album were held on March 15, 1967 at London&#x27;s Ryemuse Studios which yielded rough renditions of &quot;SWLABR&quot;, &quot;Blue Condition&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Going Wrong&quot; as well as three other Bruce/Brown compositions: &quot;Hey Now Princess&quot;, &quot;The Weird Of Hermiston&quot; and &quot;The Clearout&quot;, the latter two of which would be re-recorded for Bruce&#x27;s 1969 solo effort &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;. On April 3, following the band&#x27;s nine shows as part of Murray the K&#x27;s &quot;Music in the 5th Dimension&quot; concert series which comprised their first tour of America, Cream checked into Atlantic Studios in New York City with label owner Ahmet Ertegun to record a cover of &quot;Lawdy Mama&quot;. Cream&#x27;s American label, ATCO, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic Records. Encouraged by the results, Ertegun booked more time at the studio for a return visit to the US the following month.

The bulk of the album was recorded at Atlantic between 11 and 15 May 1967. The sessions were produced by Ertegun protege and future Mountain bassist Felix Pappalardi and engineered by Tom Dowd, who would later work with Clapton on projects such as &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; and &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;. According to Dowd, the recording sessions took only three-and-a-half days, as the band&#x27;s visas expired on the very last day of recording. Pappalardi soon proved his worth to the group when he took the tape of &quot;Lawdy Mama&quot; recorded in April and added new lyrics he co-wrote with his wife Gail Collins, transforming the song into &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, the first track completed at the sessions (the Pappalardi songwriting team would also contribute &quot;World of Pain&quot;).

The sessions were swift and efficient, with the band recording no more than one or two takes of a backing track and then adding minimal overdubs, despite an Ampex 8-track recorder now available to them; Dowd reportedly had to guide the group on the use of the new equipment. The recording atmosphere was also somewhat relaxed, with visitors often encouraged to drop by including Linda Eastman, Al Kooper, Janis Joplin and local groupie Jenny Dean (who provided many of the party sounds on &quot;Take It Back&quot;). Some friction ensued when Ertegun, who had expected the band to play blues, balked at what he called the &quot;psychedelic hogwash&quot; of tracks like &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; and &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot;. Eventually he backed down after Booker T. Jones and Otis Redding both expressed their adoration of &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. Believing the band to be led by Clapton, and that the star of a band should sing, he was also reticent at the idea of Jack or Ginger taking any vocal leads but again relented after resistance from the group. The sessions reportedly concluded just hours before their visas expired and the band was due to fly back to the UK.

==Musical style==
&quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; features the group veering away, quite heavily, from their blues roots and indulging in more psychedelic sounds, in particular on tracks such as &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot;, &quot;SWLABR&quot;, &quot;World of Pain&quot; and &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot;. &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; had been inspired by a trip to Ibiza that artist Martin Sharp had recently taken, where the sirens were alleged to have sung to Ulysses. &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; was penned by Pete Brown as a tribute to the freedom dancing gave him after he quit drugs, while the words to &quot;We&#x27;re Going Wrong&quot; had been written by Bruce after a fight he&#x27;d had with his wife. The most blues-like tunes on the album are Clapton&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot;, the Bruce-Brown composition &quot;Take It Back&quot; which had been inspired by the contemporary media images of American students burning their draft cards and featured harmonica work by Jack Bruce, plus the opening track &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, which was based on the 12-bar blues &quot;Lawdy Mama&quot; and featured a guitar solo copied from Albert King&#x27;s solo on &quot;Oh Pretty Woman&quot;.

Unlike the previous &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;, which was vocally dominated by Bruce, the vocals on &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; were a more democratic affair. Clapton sings lead on &quot;Strange Brew&quot; and &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot;, plus co-lead on &quot;World of Pain&quot;, &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; and &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. Baker, meanwhile, performs lead vocals on his composition &quot;Blue Condition&quot; which the others encouraged him to write (an outtake features Clapton on vocal). All three band members sing together on &quot;Mother&#x27;s Lament&quot;.

In contrast to much of the band&#x27;s other work, &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; comprises mainly short, self-contained songs, with none of the improvisation and jamming for which the band was known onstage. In a track-by-track interview about the record for &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, Clapton revealed that &quot;World of Pain&quot; was one of his favorite tracks, written about the back tree in the garden of composer Pappalardi, and that &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot;, with its 12-string guitars (the only time the instrument was used on a Cream recording), was Bruce&#x27;s tribute to The Byrds, a band the group admired and were friends with. He also divulged that the full title of &quot;SWLABR&quot; is &quot;She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow&quot; (which lyricist Brown admitted was about a man who defaces a painting of his woman by adding facial hair) and was originally planned for release as a single, and that Eric himself chose Blind Joe Reynolds&#x27; &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot; for the album so that one of his old blues idols would be able to collect royalties. With regards to &quot;Mother&#x27;s Lament&quot;, he stated that &quot;at the end of every session we have a laugh by sitting around the piano doing a mock-English pub thing. We had a laugh with this one but it wasn&#x27;t meant to be anything. We were then told it had been recorded and they wanted to put it on the album.&quot;

==Artwork and title==
The cover art was created by Australian artist Martin Sharp who lived in the same building as Clapton, The Pheasantry in Chelsea. Sharp would go on to create the artwork to Cream&#x27;s next album &quot;Wheels of Fire&quot; and co-wrote the songs &quot;Tales of Brave Ulysses&quot; and &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; movie theme &quot;Anyone for Tennis&quot; with Clapton. The photography was by Bob Whitaker, known for his work for the Beatles, including the controversial &quot;Yesterday and Today&quot; &quot;butcher&quot; cover. Most of the photographs were taken in July 1967, with shoots in London&#x27;s Hyde Park as well as in the Scottish Highlands. Some of the images were shot on Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in the British isles. The photos show a clean-shaven Clapton with a bouffant, permed hairstyle. By the time of the album&#x27;s release in November, however, he was letting his hair grow out straight and had grown a moustache.

The front cover consists of a psychedelic collage with the title centred and band name below, surrounded by a floral arrangement. Martin Sharp was attempting to capture the sound of the music in the cover, which he describes as a &quot;warm fluorescent sound&quot;:

The cover art was later used for the compilation &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;.

Drummer Ginger Baker recalled how the album&#x27;s title was based on a malapropism which alluded to 19th-century British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli:
==Release==
The album was released on 2 November 1967 by Reaction Records and was a big commercial success, reaching No. 5 on the UK Albums Chart, No. 4 in the US and No. 1 on the Swedish and Finnish charts. The album was also No. 1 for two weeks on the Australian album chart and was listed as the No. 1 album of 1968 by &quot;Cash Box&quot; in its year-end album chart.

===Deluxe Edition===
The original 11-track album was remastered by Joseph M. Palmaccio at PolyGram Studios for a 1998 release, including bonus photographs accompanying the original album artwork.

The &quot;Disraeli Gears Deluxe Edition&quot; includes the complete album in both mono and stereo, demos, alternative takes and tracks taken from the band&#x27;s live sessions on BBC radio. Included is an outtake of &quot;Blue Condition&quot; with Eric Clapton on lead vocals, and demos of the songs &quot;Weird of Hermiston&quot; and &quot;The Clearout&quot; which were not released until Jack Bruce&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Songs for a Tailor&quot;.

==Reception==

The album was highly praised on release. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; stated that it was &quot;a quality-heavy, propelling package of incredible Cream superpower. Clapton&#x27;s guitar menacing almost like a machine gun, sometimes eerily and overpoweringly persuasive as it reaches serpent-like deep into the Cream&#x27;s varied and hypnotic musical journeys.&quot; &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; raved it &quot;shows the completely individual way the group is developing from their early blues days&quot;, pointing out that all the songs are &quot;more or less perfect and it&#x27;s merely a matter of personal bias which you think is best.&quot; In the United States, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave a largely positive review, noting it displayed a more original direction than the debut album with &quot;miles of listening pleasure&quot; in tracks like &quot;Strange Brew&quot;, &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot;, &quot;SWLABR&quot; and &quot;Take It Back&quot; but also critiquing that the album &quot;does not totally hang together&quot; where &quot;in some tracks the material is too pale to support the heavy instrumental work which makes Cream such an overwhelming trio&quot;.

Retrospectively, writing for the BBC, Chris Jones described the album as &quot;a perfect encapsulation of the point where the blues got psychedelic and in turn got heavy&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Louder&quot; notes &quot;it captured epic studio performances by Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker at the peak of their powers as a group&quot; and &quot;became a touchstone recording of the &#x27;60s counterculture.&quot; Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic describes the album as &quot;a quintessential heavy rock album of the &#x27;60s&quot; while Dave Swanson of Ultimate Classic Rock likewise believes the album to be their masterpiece.

In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

It was voted number 182 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003 the album was ranked number 112 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, then was re-ranked at number 114 in a 2012 revised list, and at number 170 in a 2020 revised list. VH1 named it 87th-greatest album of all time in 2001.

In 2008, the album won a Classic Rock Roll of Honours Award for Classic Album.

<doc id="669713" wikidata="Q15143885" url="?curid=669713" title="Capillary wave">
<text>A capillary wave is a wave traveling along the phase boundary of a fluid, whose dynamics and phase velocity are dominated by the effects of surface tension.

Capillary waves are common in nature, and are often referred to as ripples. The wavelength of capillary waves on water is typically less than a few centimeters, with a phase speed in excess of 0.2–0.3 meter/second.

A longer wavelength on a fluid interface will result in gravity–capillary waves which are influenced by both the effects of surface tension and gravity, as well as by fluid inertia. Ordinary gravity waves have a still longer wavelength.

Light breezes upon the surface of water which stir up such small ripples are also sometimes referred to as &#x27;cat&#x27;s paws&#x27;. On the open ocean, much larger ocean surface waves (seas and swells) may result from coalescence of smaller wind-caused ripple-waves.

==Dispersion relation==
The dispersion relation describes the relationship between wavelength and frequency in waves. Distinction can be made between pure capillary waves – fully dominated by the effects of surface tension – and gravity–capillary waves which are also affected by gravity.

===Capillary waves, proper===
The dispersion relation for capillary waves is

:formula_1
where formula_2 is the angular frequency, formula_3 the surface tension, formula_4 the density of the 
heavier fluid, formula_5 the density of the lighter fluid and formula_6 the wavenumber. The wavelength is 
formula_7
For the boundary between fluid and vacuum (free surface), the dispersion relation reduces to
:formula_8

===Gravity–capillary waves===
When capillary waves are also affected substantially by gravity, they are called gravity–capillary waves. Their dispersion relation reads, for waves on the interface between two fluids of infinite depth:

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the acceleration due to gravity, formula_4 and formula_5 are the densities of the two fluids formula_13. The factor formula_14 in the first term is the Atwood number.

====Gravity wave regime====
For large wavelengths (small formula_15), only the first term is relevant and one has gravity waves.
In this limit, the waves have a group velocity half the phase velocity: following a single wave&#x27;s crest in a group one can see the wave appearing at the back of the group, growing and finally disappearing at the front of the group.

====Capillary wave regime====
Shorter (large formula_6) waves (e.g. 2 mm for the water–air interface), which are proper capillary waves, do the opposite: an individual wave appears at the front of the group, grows when moving towards the group center and finally disappears at the back of the group. Phase velocity is two thirds of group velocity in this limit.

====Phase velocity minimum====
Between these two limits is a point at which the dispersion caused by gravity cancels out the dispersion due to the capillary effect. At a certain wavelength, the group velocity equals the phase velocity, and there is no dispersion. At precisely this same wavelength, the phase velocity of gravity–capillary waves as a function of wavelength (or wave number) has a minimum. Waves with wavelengths much smaller than this critical wavelength formula_17 are dominated by surface tension, and much above by gravity. The value of this wavelength and the associated minimum phase speed formula_18 are:

:formula_19
For the air–water interface, formula_17 is found to be , and formula_18 is .

If one drops a small stone or droplet into liquid, the waves then propagate outside an expanding circle of fluid at rest; this circle is a caustic which corresponds to the minimal group velocity.

====Derivation====
As Richard Feynman put it, &quot;[water waves] that are easily seen by everyone and which are usually used as an example of waves in elementary courses [...] are the worst possible example [...]; they have all the complications that waves can have.&quot; The derivation of the general dispersion relation is therefore quite involved.

There are three contributions to the energy, due to gravity, to surface tension, and to hydrodynamics. The first two are potential energies, and responsible for the two terms inside the parenthesis, as is clear from the appearance of formula_10 and formula_3. For gravity, an assumption is made of the density of the fluids being constant (i.e., incompressibility), and likewise formula_10 (waves are not high enough for gravitation to change appreciably). For surface tension, the deviations from planarity (as measured by derivatives of the surface) are supposed to be small. For common waves both approximations are good enough.

The third contribution involves the kinetic energies of the fluids. It is the most complicated and calls for a hydrodynamic framework. Incompressibility is again involved (which is satisfied if the speed of the waves is much less than the speed of sound in the media), together with the flow being irrotational – the flow is then potential. These are typically also good approximations for common situations.

The resulting equation for the potential (which is Laplace equation) can be solved with the proper boundary conditions. On one hand, the velocity must vanish well below the surface (in the &quot;deep water&quot; case, which is the one we consider, otherwise a more involved result is obtained, see Ocean surface waves.) On the other, its vertical component must match the motion of the surface. This contribution ends up being responsible for the extra formula_6 outside the parenthesis, which causes all regimes to be dispersive, both at low values of formula_6, and high ones (except around the one value at which the two dispersions cancel out.)

<text>David Rittenberg (November 11, 1906 – January 24, 1970) was an American biochemist who pioneered the isotopic &quot;tagging&quot; of molecules. He was born and died in New York, and spent almost the whole of his life there. He obtained his B.S. in 1929 from the City College of New York, and his Ph.D. in 1935 at Columbia University under the supervision of Harold Urey.

==Research on isotopes as tracers==

Rittenberg&#x27;s doctoral work concerned thermodynamic properties of molecules containing 2H (deuterium), and he built his career principally on work with isotopes.

His introduction of the use of 2H as a tracer to follow the fate of various different compounds in human metabolism changed the prevailing scientific theory, from a static, &quot;wear and tear&quot; view of metabolic processes, to a dynamic theory in which there is constant and rapid buildup and degradation of body constituents.

In their Biographical Memoir David Shemin and Ronald Bentley described the approach in these terms:
From 1935 onwards Schoenheimer and Rittenberg published a long series of papers in the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot; on the general topic of 2H as an indicator in the study of intermediary metabolism, starting with a general introduction to the topic, and continuing to 1938 with a study of hydrogen in amino acids.

From 1939 onwards Schoenheimer and Rittenberg continued on the same road with a further long series of papers in the &quot;Journal of Biological Chemistry&quot; on protein metabolism, starting by describing some general considerations.

==Weizmann Institute==

Although Rittenberg remained throughout his career at Columbia University, he also participated in the early years of the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel, first as a member of the Planning Board and later as a member of the Board of Governors. He was a made an honorary fellow of the institute in 1967. Later he joined the advisory board of the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem.

<doc id="669724" wikidata="Q732410" url="?curid=669724" title="Transatlantic flight">
<text>A transatlantic flight is the flight of an aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe, Africa, South Asia, or the Middle East to North America, Latin America, or &quot;vice versa&quot;. Such flights have been made by fixed-wing aircraft, airships, balloons and other aircraft.

Early aircraft engines had neither the reliability nor the power to lift the required fuel to make a transatlantic flight. There were difficulties navigating over the featureless expanse of water for thousands of miles, and the weather, especially in the North Atlantic, is unpredictable. Since the middle of the 20th century, however, transatlantic flight has become routine, for commercial, military, diplomatic, and other purposes.

==History==

The idea of transatlantic flight came about with the advent of the hot air balloon. The balloons of the period were inflated with coal gas, a moderate lifting medium compared to hydrogen or helium, but with enough lift to use the winds that would later be known as the Jet Stream. In 1859, John Wise built an enormous aerostat named the &quot;Atlantic&quot;, intending to cross the Atlantic. The flight lasted less than a day, crash-landing in Henderson, New York. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe prepared a massive balloon of called the &quot;City of New York&quot; to take off from Philadelphia in 1860, but was interrupted by the onset of the American Civil War in 1861. 

Powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle 360 hp engines, the Vickers Vimy flown by British aviators Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight in 1919. The first successful transatlantic flight in a balloon was the Double Eagle II from Presque Isle, Maine, to Miserey, near Paris in 1978.

===First transatlantic flights===

In April 1913, the London newspaper &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; offered a prize of £10,000 (£ in ) to

The competition was suspended with the outbreak of World War I in 1914 but reopened after Armistice was declared in 1918. The war saw tremendous advances in aerial capabilities, and a real possibility of transatlantic flight by aircraft emerged.

Between 8 and 31 May 1919, the Curtiss seaplane &quot;NC-4&quot; made a crossing of the Atlantic flying from the U.S. to Newfoundland, then to the Azores, and on to mainland Portugal and finally the United Kingdom. The whole journey took 23 days, with six stops along the way. A trail of 53 &quot;station ships&quot; across the Atlantic gave the aircraft points to navigate by. This flight was not eligible for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize since it took more than 72 consecutive hours and also because more than one aircraft was used in the attempt.

Four teams were competing for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. They were Australian pilot Harry Hawker with observer Kenneth Mackenzie-Grieve in a single-engine Sopwith Atlantic; Frederick Raynham and C. W. F. Morgan in a Martinsyde; the Handley Page Group, led by Mark Kerr; and the Vickers entry John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown. Each group had to ship its aircraft to Newfoundland and make a rough field for the takeoff.

Hawker and Mackenzie-Grieve made the first attempt on 18 May, but engine failure brought them down into the ocean where they were rescued. Raynham and Morgan also attempted on 18 May but crashed on takeoff due to the high fuel load. The Handley Page team was in the final stages of testing its aircraft for the flight in June, but the Vickers group was ready earlier.

During 14–15 June 1919, the British aviators Alcock and Brown made the first non-stop transatlantic flight. During the War, Alcock resolved to fly the Atlantic, and after the war, he approached the Vickers engineering and aviation firm at Weybridge, which had considered entering its Vickers Vimy IV twin-engined bomber in the competition but had not yet found a pilot. Alcock&#x27;s enthusiasm impressed Vickers&#x27;s team, and he was appointed as its pilot. Work began on converting the Vimy for the long flight, replacing its bomb racks with extra petrol tanks. Shortly afterwards Brown, who was unemployed, approached Vickers seeking a post and his knowledge of long-distance navigation convinced them to take him on as Alcock&#x27;s navigator.

Vickers&#x27;s team quickly assembled its plane and at around 1:45 p.m. on 14 June, while the Handley Page team was conducting yet another test, the Vickers plane took off from Lester&#x27;s Field, in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

Alcock and Brown flew the modified Vickers Vimy, powered by two Rolls-Royce Eagle 360 hp engines. It was not an easy flight, with unexpected fog, and a snow storm almost causing the crewmen to crash into the sea. Their altitude varied between sea level and and upon takeoff, they carried 865 imperial gallons (3,900 L) of fuel. They made landfall in Clifden, County Galway at 8:40 a.m. on 15 June 1919, not far from their intended landing place, after less than sixteen hours of flying.
The Secretary of State for Air, Winston Churchill, presented Alcock and Brown with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize for the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in &quot;less than 72 consecutive hours&quot;. There was a small amount of mail (3lb) carried on the flight making it also the first transatlantic airmail flight. The two aviators were knighted one week later by King George V at Windsor Castle.

The first transatlantic flight by rigid airship, and the first return transatlantic flight, was made just a couple of weeks after the transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown, on 2 July 1919. Major George Herbert Scott of the Royal Air Force flew the airship R34 with his crew and passengers from RAF East Fortune, Scotland to Mineola, New York (on Long Island), covering a distance of about in about four and a half days.

The flight was intended as a testing ground for postwar commercial services by airship (see Imperial Airship Scheme), and it was the first flight to transport paying passengers. The R34 wasn&#x27;t built as a passenger carrier, so extra accommodations were arranged by slinging hammocks in the keel walkway. The return journey to Pulham in Norfolk, was from 10 to 13 July over some 75 hours.

The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators Gago Coutinho and Sacadura Cabral in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in stages, using three different Fairey III biplanes, and they covered a distance of between 30 March and 17 June.

The first transatlantic flight between Spain and South America was completed in January 1926 with a crew of Spanish aviators on board &quot;Plus Ultra&quot;, a Dornier Do J flying boat; the crew was the captain Ramón Franco, co-pilot Julio Ruiz de Alda Miqueleiz, Teniente de Navio (Navy Lieutenant), Juan Manuel Durán, and Pablo Rada.

The first transpolar flight eastbound and the first flight crossing the North Pole ever was the airship carrying Norwegian explorer and pilot Roald Amundsen on 11 May 1926. He flew with the airship &quot;NORGE&quot; (&quot;Norway&quot;) piloted by the Italian colonel Umberto Nobile, non-stop from Svalbard, Norway to Teller, Alaska, USA. The flight lasted for 72 hours.

The first night-time crossing of the South Atlantic was accomplished on 16–17 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators Sarmento de Beires, Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the Bijagós Archipelago, Portuguese Guinea, to Fernando de Noronha, Brazil in the &quot;Argos&quot;, a Dornier Wal flying boat.
In the early morning of 20 May 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field, Mineola, New York, on his successful attempt to fly nonstop from New York to the European continental land mass. Over the next 33.5 hours, Lindbergh and the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; encountered many challenges before landing at Le Bourget Airport near Paris, at 10:22 p.m. on 21 May 1927, completing the first solo crossing of the Atlantic.

The first east-west non-stop transatlantic crossing by an aeroplane was made in 1928 by the &quot;Bremen&quot;, a German Junkers W33 type aircraft, from Baldonnel Airfield in County Dublin, Ireland.

On 18 August 1932 Jim Mollison made the first east-to-west solo trans-Atlantic flight; flying from Portmarnock in Ireland to Pennfield, New Brunswick, Canada in a de Havilland Puss Moth.

In 1936 the first woman aviator to cross the Atlantic east to west, and the first person to fly solo from England to North America, was Beryl Markham. She wrote about her adventures in her memoir, &quot;West with the Night&quot;.

The first transpolar transatlantic (and transcontinental) crossing was the piloted by the crew led by Valery Chkalov covering some over 63 hours from Moscow, Russia to Vancouver, Washington from 18–20 June 1937.

===Commercial airship flights===
On 11 October 1928, Hugo Eckener, commanding the airship &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; as part of DELAG&#x27;s operations, began the first non-stop transatlantic passenger flights, leaving Friedrichshafen, Germany, at 07:54 on 11 October 1928, and arriving at NAS Lakehurst, New Jersey, on 15 October.

Thereafter, DELAG used the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; on regularly scheduled passenger flights across the North Atlantic, from Frankfurt-am-Main to Lakehurst. In the summer of 1931, a South Atlantic route was introduced, from Frankfurt and Friedrichshafen to Recife and Rio de Janeiro. Between 1931 and 1937 the &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; crossed the South Atlantic 136 times.

The British rigid airship R100 made a successful return trip from Cardington to Montreal in July–August 1930, in what was intended to be a proving flight for regularly scheduled passenger services. Following the R101 disaster in October 1930, the British rigid airship program was abandoned and the R100 scrapped, leaving DELAG as the sole remaining operator of transatlantic passenger airship flights.

In 1936 DELAG began passenger flights with &quot;LZ 129 Hindenburg&quot;, and made 36 Atlantic crossings (North and South). The first passenger trip across the North Atlantic left Friedrichshafen on 6 May with 56 crew and 50 passengers, arriving at Lakehurst on 9 May. The fare was $400 one way; the ten westward trips that season took 53 to 78 hours and eastward took 43 to 61 hours. The last eastward trip of the year left Lakehurst on 10 October; the first North Atlantic trip of 1937 ended in the Hindenburg disaster.

===Commercial aeroplane service attempts===

It would take two more decades after Alcock and Brown&#x27;s first nonstop flight across the Atlantic in 1919 before commercial airplane flights became practical. The North Atlantic presented severe challenges for aviators due to weather and the long distances involved, with few stopping points. Initial transatlantic services, therefore, focused on the South Atlantic, where some French, German, and Italian airlines offered seaplane service for mail between South America and West Africa in the 1930s.

Between February 1934 and August 1939 Lufthansa operated a regular airmail service between Natal, Brazil, and Bathurst, Gambia, continuing &quot;via&quot; the Canary Islands and Spain to Stuttgart, Germany. From December 1935, Air France opened a regular weekly airmail route between South America and Africa. German airlines experimented with mail routes over the North Atlantic in the early 1930s, with flying boats and dirigibles. 

In August 1938 a Deutsche Luft Hansa Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor long-range airliner flew non-stop from Berlin to New York and returned non-stop as a proving flight for the development of passenger-carrying services. This was the first landplane to fulfil this function and marked a departure from the British and American reliance on flying boats for long over-water routes. Operators of the Fw 200 focussed on other routes, though.

==== Flying boats ====

In the 1930s a flying boat route was the only practical means of transatlantic air travel, as land-based aircraft lacked sufficient range for the crossing. An agreement between the governments of the US, Britain, Canada, and the Irish Free State in 1935 set aside the Irish town of Foynes, the most westerly port in Ireland, as the terminal for all such services to be established.

Imperial Airways had bought the Short Empire flying boat, primarily for use along the empire routes to Africa, Asia and Australia, and had established an international airport on Darrell&#x27;s Island, in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda (640 miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina), which began serving both Imperial Airways, subsequently renamed British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and Pan American World Airways (PAA) flights from the United States in 1936, but began exploring the possibility of using it for transatlantic flights from 1937. PAA would begin scheduled trans-Atlantic flights via Bermuda before Imperial Airways did, enabling the United States Government to covertly assist the British Government before the United States entry into the Second World War as mail was taken off trans-Atlantic PAA flights by the Imperial Censorship of British Security Co-ordination to search for secret communications from Axis spies operating in the United States, including the Joe K ring, with information gained being shared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The range of the Short Empire flying boat was less than that of the equivalent US Sikorsky &quot;Clipper&quot; flying boats and as such was initially unable to provide a true trans-Atlantic service.

Two flying boats (&quot;Caledonia&quot; and &quot;Cambria&quot;) were lightened and given long-range tanks to increase the aircraft&#x27;s range to .

In the US, attention was at first focused on transatlantic flights for a faster postal service between Europe and the United States. In 1931 W. Irving Glover, the second assistant postmaster, wrote an article for &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; on the challenges and the need for a regular service. In the 1930s, under the direction of Juan Trippe, Pan American began to get interested in the feasibility of a transatlantic passenger service using flying boats.

On 5 July 1937, A.S. Wilcockson flew a Short Empire for Imperial Airways from Foynes to Botwood, Newfoundland and Harold Gray piloted a Sikorsky S-42 for Pan American in the opposite direction. Both flights were a success and both airlines made a series of subsequent proving flights that same year to test out a variety of different weather conditions. Air France also became interested and began experimental flights in 1938.

As the Short Empire only had enough range with enlarged fuel tanks at the expense of a passenger room, several pioneering experiments were done with the aircraft to work around the problem. It was known that aircraft could maintain flight with a greater load than is possible to take off with, so Major Robert H. Mayo, Technical general manager at Imperial Airways, proposed mounting a small, long-range seaplane on top of a larger carrier aircraft, using the combined power of both to bring the smaller aircraft to operational height, at which time the two aircraft would separate, the carrier aircraft returning to base while the other flew on to its destination.

The Short Mayo Composite project, co-designed by Mayo and Shorts chief designer Arthur Gouge, comprised the &quot;Short S.21 Maia&quot;, (&quot;G-ADHK&quot;) which was a variant of the Short &quot;C-Class&quot; Empire flying-boat fitted with a trestle or pylon on the top of the fuselage to support the &quot;Short S.20 Mercury&quot;(&quot;G-ADHJ&quot;).

The first successful in-flight separation of the &quot;Composite&quot; was carried out on 6 February 1938, and the first transatlantic flight was made on 21 July 1938 from Foynes to Boucherville. &quot;Mercury&quot;, piloted by Captain Don Bennett, separated from her carrier at 8 pm to continue what was to become the first commercial non-stop east-to-west transatlantic flight by a heavier-than-air machine. This initial journey took 20 hrs, 21 min at an average ground speed of .

Another technology developed for transatlantic commercial flight was aerial refuelling. Sir Alan Cobham developed the &quot;Grappled-line looped-hose&quot; system to stimulate the possibility for long-range transoceanic commercial aircraft flights, and publicly demonstrated it for the first time in 1935. In the system, the receiver aircraft trailed a steel cable which was then grappled by a line shot from the tanker. The line was then drawn back into the tanker where the receiver&#x27;s cable was connected to the refueling hose. The receiver could then haul back in its cable bringing the hose to it. Once the hose was connected, the tanker climbed sufficiently above the receiver aircraft to allow the fuel to flow under gravity.

Cobham founded Flight Refuelling Ltd in 1934 and by 1938 had demonstrated the &quot;FRL&#x27;s looped-hose&quot; system to refuel the Short Empire flying boat &quot;Cambria&quot; from an Armstrong Whitworth AW.23. Handley Page Harrows were used in the 1939 trials to aerial refuel the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings. From 5 August – 1 October 1939, sixteen crossings of the Atlantic were made by Empire flying boats, with 15 crossings using FRL&#x27;s aerial refuelling system. After the 16 crossings more trials were suspended due to the outbreak of World War II.

The Short S.26 was built in 1939 as an enlarged Short Empire, powered by four 1,400 hp (1,044 kW) Bristol Hercules sleeve valve radial engines and designed with the capability of crossing the Atlantic without refuelling. It was intended to form the backbone of Imperial Airways&#x27; Empire services. It could fly unburdened, or 150 passengers for a &quot;short hop&quot;. On 21 July 1939, the first aircraft, (G-AFCI &quot;Golden Hind&quot;), was first flown at Rochester by Shorts&#x27; chief test pilot, John Lankester Parker. Although two aircraft were handed over to Imperial Airways for crew training, all three were impressed (along with their crews) into the RAF before they could begin civilian operation with the onset of World War II.

Meanwhile, Pan Am bought nine Boeing 314 Clippers in 1939, a long-range flying boat capable of flying the Atlantic. The &quot;Clippers&quot; were built for &quot;one-class&quot; luxury air travel, a necessity given the long duration of transoceanic flights. The seats could be converted into 36 bunks for overnight accommodation; with a cruising speed of only . The 314s had a lounge and dining area, and the galleys were crewed by chefs from four-star hotels. Men and women were provided with separate dressing rooms, and white-coated stewards served five and six-course meals with gleaming silver service.

The &quot;Yankee Clipper&quot;&#x27;s inaugural trip across the Atlantic was on 24 June 1939. Its route was from Southampton to Port Washington, New York with intermediate stops at Foynes, Ireland, Botwood, Newfoundland, and Shediac, New Brunswick. Its first passenger flight was on 9 July, and this continued only until the onset of the Second World War, less than two months later. The &quot;Clipper&quot; fleet was then pressed into military service and the flying boats were used for ferrying personnel and equipment to the European and Pacific fronts.

===Maturation===

It was from the emergency exigencies of World War II that crossing the Atlantic by land-based aircraft became a practical and commonplace possibility. With the Fall of France in June 1940, and the loss of much war materiel on the continent, the need for the British to purchase replacement materiel from the United States was urgent. Airbases for refuelling were built in Greenland and Iceland, which were occupied by the United States after the German invasion of Denmark (1940).

The British and United States Governments hurried a secret agreement before Britain declared war on Germany in 1939 for the United States to establish a base in Bermuda. Ultimately, the agreement would be expanded to include a United States Naval Operating Base, containing a Naval Air Station serving anti-submarine flying boats, on the Great Sound (near to the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda, Royal Naval Air Station Bermuda that had been operated for the Royal Navy with the rest of the Fleet Air Arm at its original location in HM Dockyard Bermuda until 1939 by the Royal Air Force, and the Darrell&#x27;s Island airport, which the Royal Air Force took over for trans-Atlantic ferrying of flying boats such as the Catalinas, which were flown there from United States factories to be tested before acceptance by the Air Ministry and delivery across the Atlantic, usually on direct flights to Greenock, Scotland. RAF Transport Command flights, such as those flown by Coronados, also utilised the facility as BOAC and PAA continued to do) and Kindley Field, serving land planes, constructed by the United States Army for operation by the United States Army Air Forces, but to be used jointly by the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy. In January 1942, Prime Minister Winston Churchill visited Bermuda on his return to Britain, following December 1941 meetings in Washington D.C., with US President Franklin Roosevelt, in the weeks after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Churchill flew into Darrell&#x27;s Island on the BOAC Boeing 314 &quot;Berwick&quot;. Although it had been planned to continue the journey aboard the battleship HMS Duke of York, he made an impulsive decision to complete it by a direct flight from Bermuda to Plymouth, England aboard Berwick, marking the first trans-Atlantic air crossing by a national leader. When the first runway at Kindley Field became operational in 1943, the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm relocated Roc target tugs that had been operating on floats from RNAS Bermuda to the airfield to operate as land planes, and RAF Transport Command moved its operations there, leaving RAF Ferry Command at Darrell&#x27;s Island.

The time it was taken for an aircraft – such as the Lockheed Hudson – bought in the United States, to be flown to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and then partially dis-assembled before being transported by ship to England, where it was re-assembled and subject to repairs of any damage sustained during shipment, could mean an aircraft could not enter service for several weeks. Further, German U-boats operating in the North Atlantic Ocean made it particularly hazardous for merchant ships between Newfoundland and Britain.

Larger aircraft could be flown directly to the UK and an organization was set up to manage this using civilian pilots. The program was begun by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Its minister, Lord Beaverbrook a Canadian by origin, reached an agreement with Sir Edward Beatty, a friend and chairman of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to provide ground facilities and support. Ministry of Aircraft Production would provide civilian crews and management and former RAF officer Don Bennett, a specialist in long-distance flying and later Air Vice Marshal and commander of the Pathfinder Force, led the first delivery flight in November 1940.

In 1941, MAP took the operation off CPR to put the whole operation under the Atlantic Ferry Organization (&quot;Atfero&quot;), which was set up by Morris W. Wilson, a banker in Montreal. Wilson hired civilian pilots to fly the aircraft to the UK. The pilots were then ferried back in converted RAF Liberators. &quot;Atfero hired the pilots, planned the routes, selected the airports [and] set up weather and radiocommunication stations.&quot;
The organization was passed to the Air Ministry administration by retaining civilian pilots, some of whom were Americans, alongside RAF navigators and British radio operators. After completing delivery, crews were flown back to Canada for the next run. RAF Ferry Command was formed on 20 July 1941, by the raising of the RAF Atlantic Ferry Service to Command status. Its commander for its whole existence was Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Bowhill.

As its name suggests, the main function of Ferry Command was the ferrying of new aircraft from factory to operational unit. Ferry Command did this over only one area of the world, rather than the more general routes that Transport Command later developed. The Command&#x27;s operational area was the North Atlantic, and its responsibility was to bring the larger aircraft that had the range to do the trip over the ocean from American and Canadian factories to the RAF home Commands.

With the entry of the United States into the War, the Atlantic Division of the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command began similar ferrying services to transport aircraft, supplies, and passengers to the British Isles.

By September 1944 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), as Imperial Airways had by then become, had made 1,000 transatlantic crossings.

After World War II long runways were available, and North American and European carriers such as Pan Am, TWA, Trans Canada Airlines (TCA), BOAC, and Air France acquired larger piston airliners that could cross the North Atlantic with stops (usually in Gander, Newfoundland and/or Shannon, Ireland). In January 1946 Pan Am&#x27;s Douglas DC-4 was scheduled from New York (La Guardia) to London (Hurn) in 17 hours 40 minutes, five days a week; in June 1946 Lockheed L-049 Constellations had brought the eastward time to London Heathrow down to 15 hr 15 min.

To aid aircraft crossing the Atlantic, six nations grouped to divide the Atlantic into ten zones. Each zone had a letter and a vessel station in that zone, providing radio relays, radio navigation beacons, weather reports, and rescues if an aircraft went down. The six nations of the group split the cost of these vessels.

The September 1947 ABC Guide shows 27 passenger flights a week west across the North Atlantic to the US and Canada on BOAC and other European airlines and 151 flights every two weeks on Pan Am, AOA, TWA, and TCA, 15 flights a week to the Caribbean and South America, plus three a month on Iberia and a Latécoère 631 six-engine flying boat every two weeks to Fort de France.
In May 1952, BOAC was the first airline to introduce a passenger jet, the de Havilland Comet, into airline service, operating on routes in Europe and beyond (but not transatlantic). All Comet 1 aircraft were grounded in April 1954 after four Comets crashed, the last two being BOAC aircraft which suffered catastrophic failure at altitude. Later jet airliners, including the larger and longer-range Comet 4, were designed so that in the event of for example a skin failure due to cracking the damage would be localized and not catastrophic.

On 4 October 1958, BOAC started the &quot;first-ever transatlantic jet service&quot; between London Heathrow and New York Idlewild with a Comet 4, and Pan Am followed on 26 October with a Boeing 707 service between New York and Paris.

Supersonic flights on Concorde were offered from 1976 to 2003, from London (by British Airways) and Paris (by Air France) to New York and Washington, and back, with flight times of around three and a half hours one-way. Since the loosening of regulations in the 1970s and 1980s, many airlines now compete across the Atlantic.

=== Present day ===

In 2015, 44 million seats were offered on the transatlantic routes, an increase of 6% over the previous year. Of the 67 European airports with links to North America, the busiest was London Heathrow Airport with 231,532 weekly seats, followed by Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport with 129,831, Frankfurt Airport with 115,420, and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol with 79,611. Of the 45 airports in North America, the busiest linked to Europe was New York John F. Kennedy International Airport with 198,442 seats, followed by Toronto Pearson International Airport with 90,982, New York Newark Liberty International Airport with 79,107, and Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport with 75,391 seats.

Joint ventures, allowing coordination on prices, schedules, and strategy, control almost 75% of Transatlantic capacity. They are parallel to airline alliances: British Airways, Iberia and American Airlines are part of Oneworld; Lufthansa, Air Canada and United Airlines are members of Star Alliance; and Delta Air Lines, Air France, KLM and Alitalia belong to SkyTeam. Low cost carriers are starting to compete on this market, most importantly Norwegian Air Shuttle, WestJet and WOW Air. A total of 431 non-stop routes between North America and Europe were scheduled for summer 2017, up 84 routes from 347 in 2012 – a 24% increase.

In 2016 Dr. Paul Williams of the University of Reading published a scientific study showing that transatlantic flight times are expected to change as the North Atlantic jet stream responds to global warming, with eastbound flights speeding up and westbound flights slowing down.

In February 2017, Norwegian Air International announced it would start transatlantic flights to the United States from the United Kingdom and Ireland in the summer of 2017 on behalf of its parent company using the parent&#x27;s new Boeing 737 MAX aircraft expected to be delivered from May 2017.
Norwegian Air performed its first transatlantic flight with a Boeing 737-800 on 16 June 2017 between Edinburgh Airport and Stewart Airport, New York.
The first transatlantic flight with a 737 MAX was performed on 15 July 2017, with a MAX 8 named &quot;Sir Freddie Laker&quot;, between Edinburgh Airport in Scotland and Hartford International Airport in the US state of Connecticut, followed by a second rotation from Edinburgh to Stewart Airport, New York.

Long-haul low-cost carriers are emerging on the transatlantic market with 545,000 seats offered over 60 city pairs in September 2017 (a 66% growth over one year), compared to 652,000 seats over 96 pairs for leisure airlines and 8,798,000 seats over 357 pairs for mainline carriers.
LCC seats grew to 7.7% of North Atlantic seats in 2018 from 3.0% in 2016, led by Norwegian with 4.8% then WOW air with 1.6% and WestJet with 0.6%, while the three airline alliances dedicated joint ventures seat share is 72.3%, down from 79.8% in 2015.
By July 2018, Norwegian became the largest European airline for New York, carrying 1.67 million passengers over a year, beating British Airways&#x27;s 1.63 million, while the U.S. major carriers combined transported 26.1 million transatlantic passengers.

==Transatlantic routes==

Unlike over land, transatlantic flights use standardized aircraft routes called North Atlantic Tracks (NATs). These change daily in position (although altitudes are standardized) to compensate for weather—particularly the jet stream tailwinds and headwinds, which may be substantial at cruising altitudes and have a strong influence on trip duration and fuel economy. Eastbound flights generally operate during night-time hours, while westbound flights generally operate during daytime hours, for passenger convenience. The eastbound flow, as it is called, generally makes European landfall from about 0600UT to 0900UT. The westbound flow generally operates within a 1200–1500UT time slot. Restrictions on how far a given aircraft may be from an airport also play a part in determining its route; in the past, airliners with three or more engines were not restricted, but a twin-engine airliner was required to stay within a certain distance of airports that could accommodate it (since a single engine failure in a four-engine aircraft is less crippling than a single engine failure in a twin). Modern aircraft with two engines flying transatlantic (the most common models used for transatlantic service being the Airbus A330, Airbus A350, Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787) have to be ETOPS certified.


Gaps in air traffic control and radar coverage over large stretches of the Earth&#x27;s oceans, as well as an absence of most types of radio navigation aids, impose a requirement for a high level of autonomy in navigation upon transatlantic flights. Aircraft must include reliable systems that can determine the aircraft&#x27;s course and position with great accuracy over long distances. In addition to the traditional compass, inertials and satellite navigation systems such as GPS all have their place in transatlantic navigation. Land-based systems such as VOR and DME, because they operate &quot;line of sight&quot;, are mostly useless for ocean crossings, except in initial and final legs within about of those facilities. In the late 1950s and early 1960s an important facility for low-flying aircraft was the Radio Range. Inertial navigation systems became prominent in the 1970s.

===Busiest transatlantic routes===
The twenty busiest commercial routes between North America and Europe (traffic traveling in both directions) during June until August 2022 were:

===London to New York===

The London to New York Air Route is an air route between London, UK, and New York, US. These two cities are connected by a heavily utilised air route which has been historically important to transatlantic aviation and is today served by several major airlines (British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue Airways: United Airlines flies out of the nearby airport of Newark, away from downtown Manhattan). The airports of Heathrow and JFK are the main international airports for the London metropolitan area and New York metropolitan area respectively, the world&#x27;s two most important global cities. The route sustains the highest number of passenger seat kilometers per annum of any route globally (10.92 billion ASK&#x27;s were scheduled in 2015). In 2018 British Airways achieved a revenue of $1.16 billion on this route alone, making their operation the highest value airline route globally. The route saw a total traffic figure in 2018 of 3,034,155 (+3.0% on 2017), the busiest of any transatlantic air route.

Prior to the aircraft&#x27;s retirement British Airways operated a double daily supersonic Concorde service on the route which covered the distance in a scheduled time of 3 hours 15 minutes westbound and just under 3 hours eastbound.

====Passenger statistics====
Below is a table of passenger numbers flying between Heathrow and JFK by year as published by the UK CAA.
====Records====
The fastest crewed flight on this route is 1 hour 54 minutes and 56.4 seconds, achieved by an eastbound SR-71 Blackbird on 1 September 1974. The flight departed from Beale Air Force Base, California and landed at Farnborough International Airshow, crossing virtual radar gates over New York and London to spare them from sonic booms. The flight required three aerial refuels with KC-135Q Stratotankers after takeoff, over South Carolina, and south of Greenland.

The fastest time for an airliner on the route is 2 hours 52 minutes and 59 seconds, this was achieved on an eastbound JFK-LHR Concorde service on 7 February 1996.

The current fastest subsonic passenger service on the route was achieved by British Airways on 9 February 2020 with a time of 4 hours 56 minutes. The Boeing 747-400 (registration: G-CIVP) operating flight BA112 departed JFK at 18:47 Eastern Standard time (23:47 UTC on 8 February) on 8 February and landed at Heathrow at 04:43 GMT/UTC on 9 February. The maximum recorded groundspeed was .

==Notable transatlantic flights and attempts==

===1910s===
;Airship America failure: In October 1910, the American journalist Walter Wellman, who had in 1909 attempted to reach the North Pole by balloon, set out for Europe from Atlantic City in a dirigible, &quot;America&quot;. A storm off Cape Cod sent him off course, and then engine failure forced him to ditch halfway between New York and Bermuda. Wellman, his crew of five – and the balloon&#x27;s cat – were rescued by RMS Trent, a passing British ship. The Atlantic bid failed, but the distance covered, about , was at the time a record for a dirigible.
;First transatlantic flight: On 8–31 May 1919, the U.S. Navy Curtiss NC-4 flying boat under the command of Albert Read, flew from Rockaway, New York, to Plymouth (England), &quot;via&quot; among other stops Trepassey (Newfoundland), Horta and Ponta Delgada (both Azores) and Lisbon (Portugal) in 53h 58m, spread over 23 days. The crossing from Newfoundland to the European mainland had taken 10 days 22 hours, with the total time in flight of 26h 46m. The longest non-stop leg of the journey, from Trepassey, Newfoundland, to Horta in the Azores, was and lasted 15h 18m.

;Sopwith Atlantic failure: On 18 May 1919, the Australian Harry Hawker, together with navigator Kenneth Mackenzie Grieve, attempted to become the first to achieve a non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. They set off from Mount Pearl, Newfoundland, in the Sopwith Atlantic biplane. After fourteen and a half hours of flight the engine overheated and they were forced to divert towards the shipping lanes: they found a passing freighter, the Danish &quot;Mary&quot;, established contact and crash-landed ahead of her. &quot;Mary&#x27;s&quot; radio was out of order, so that it was not until six days later when the boat reached Scotland that word was received that they were safe. The wheels from the undercarriage, jettisoned soon after takeoff, were later recovered by local fishermen and are now in the Newfoundland Museum in St. John&#x27;s.

; First non-stop transatlantic flight: On 14–15 June 1919, Capt. John Alcock and Lieut. Arthur Whitten Brown of the United Kingdom in Vickers Vimy bomber, between islands, , from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, to Clifden, Ireland, in 16h 12m.
;First east-to-west transatlantic flight: On 2 July 1919, Major George Herbert Scott of the Royal Air Force with his crew and passengers flies from RAF East Fortune, Scotland to Mineola, New York (on Long Island) in airship &quot;R34&quot;, covering a distance of about in about four and a half days. &quot;R34&quot; then made the return trip to England arriving at RNAS Pulham in 75 hours, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east-west-east).

===1920s===
; First flight across the South Atlantic: On 30 March–17 June 1922, Lieutenant Commander Sacadura Cabral and Commander Gago Coutinho of Portugal, using three Fairey IIID floatplanes (&quot;Lusitania&quot;, &quot;Portugal&quot;, and &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;), after two ditchings, with only internal means of navigation (the Coutinho-invented sextant with artificial horizon) from Lisbon, Portugal, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

; First non-stop aircraft flight between European and American mainlands: On 12 October 1924, the Zeppelin &quot;LZ-126&quot; (later known as &quot;ZR-3&quot; &quot;USS Los Angeles&quot;), began an 81-hour flight from Germany to New Jersey with a crew commanded by Dr. Hugo Eckener, covering a distance of .

; First night-time flight across the Atlantic: On the night of 16–17 April 1927, the Portuguese aviators Sarmento de Beires, Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flew from the Bijagós islands, Portuguese Guinea to Fernando de Noronha island, Brazil in the Dornier Wal flying boat &quot;Argos&quot;.

; First flight across the South Atlantic made by a non-European crew: On 28 April 1927, Brazilian João Ribeiro de Barros, with the assistance of João Negrão (co-pilot), Newton Braga (navigator), and Vasco Cinquini (mechanic), crossed the Atlantic in the hydroplane &quot;Jahú&quot;. The four aviators flew from Genoa, in Italy, to Santo Amaro (São Paulo), making stops in Spain, Gibraltar, Cape Verde and Fernando de Noronha, in the Brazilian territory.

; Disappearance of &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot;: On 8–9 May 1927, Charles Nungesser and François Coli attempted to cross the Atlantic from Paris to the US in a Levasseur PL-8 biplane &quot;L&#x27;Oiseau Blanc&quot; (&quot;The White Bird&quot;), but were lost.

; First solo transatlantic flight and first non-stop fixed-wing aircraft flight between America and mainland Europe: On 20–21 May 1927, Charles A. Lindbergh flew his Ryan monoplane (named &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;), , from Roosevelt Field, New York to Paris–Le Bourget Airport, in 33½ hours.
; First transatlantic air passenger: On 4–6 June 1927, the first transatlantic air passenger was Charles A. Levine. He was carried as a passenger by Clarence D. Chamberlin from Roosevelt Field, New York, to Eisleben, Germany, in a Wright-powered Bellanca.
; First non-stop air crossing of the South Atlantic: On 14–15 October 1927, Dieudonne Costes and Joseph Le Brix, flying a Breguet 19, flew from Senegal to Brazil.
; First non-stop fixed-wing aircraft westbound flight over the North Atlantic: On 12–13 April 1928, Ehrenfried Günther Freiherr von Hünefeld and Capt. Hermann Köhl of Germany and Comdr. James Fitzmaurice of Ireland, flew a Junkers W33 monoplane (named &quot;Bremen&quot;), , from Baldonnell near Dublin, Ireland, to Labrador, in 36½ hours.

; First crossing of the Atlantic by a woman: On 17–18 June 1928, Amelia Earhart was the first woman to cross the Atlantic Ocean by air with pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon.

; Notable flight (around the world): On 1–8 August 1929, in making the circumnavigation, Dr Hugo Eckener piloted the LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; across the Atlantic three times: from Germany east to west in four days from 1 August; return west to east in two days from 8 August; after completing the circumnavigation to Lakehurst, a final west to east landing 4 September, making three crossings in 34 days.

===1930s===
; First scheduled transatlantic passenger flights: From 1931 onwards, LZ 127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot; operated the world&#x27;s first scheduled transatlantic passenger flights, mainly between Germany and Brazil (64 such round trips overall) sometimes stopping in Spain, Miami, London, and Berlin.
; First nonstop east-to-west fixed-wing aircraft flight between European and American mainlands: On 1–2 September 1930, Dieudonne Costes and Maurice Bellonte flew a Breguet 19 Super Bidon biplane (named &quot;Point d&#x27;Interrogation&quot;, Question Mark), 6,200 km from Paris to New York City.
; First non-stop flight to exceed 5,000 miles distance: On 28–30 July 1931, Russell Norton Boardman and John Louis Polando flew a Bellanca Special J-300 high-wing monoplane named the &quot;Cape Cod&quot; from New York City&#x27;s Floyd Bennett Field to Istanbul’s Yeşilköy Airport –present day Atatürk Airport– in 49:20 hours in completely crossing the North Atlantic and much of the Mediterranean Sea; establishing a straight-line distance record of .
; First solo crossing of the South Atlantic: 27–28 November 1931. Bert Hinkler flew from Canada to New York, then via the West Indies, Venezuela, British Guiana, Brazil and the South Atlantic to Great Britain in a de Havilland Puss Moth.
; First solo crossing of the Atlantic by a woman: On 20 May 1932, Amelia Earhart set off from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, intending to fly to Paris in her single engine Lockheed Vega 5b to emulate Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight. After encountering storms and a burnt exhaust pipe, Earhart landed in a pasture at Culmore, north of Derry, Northern Ireland, ending a flight lasting 14h 56m.
; First solo westbound crossing of the Atlantic: On 18–19 August 1932, Jim Mollison, flying a de Havilland Puss Moth, flew from Dublin to New Brunswick.
; Lightest (empty weight) aircraft that crossed the Atlantic: On 7–8 May 1933, Stanisław Skarżyński made a solo flight across the South Atlantic, covering , in a RWD-5&quot;bis&quot; – empty weight below . If considering the total takeoff weight (as per FAI records) then there is a longer distance Atlantic crossing: the distance world record holder, Piper PA-24 Comanche in this class, 1000–1750 kg. FAI
; Mass flight: Notable mass transatlantic flight: On 1–15 July 1933, Gen. Italo Balbo of Italy led 24 Savoia-Marchetti S.55X seaplanes , in a flight from Orbetello, Italy, to the Century of Progress International Exposition Chicago, Illinois, in 47h 52m. The flight made six intermediate stops. Previously, Balbo had led a flight of 12 flying boats from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in December 1930 – January 1931, taking nearly a month.
; First solo westbound crossing of the Atlantic by a woman and first person to solo westbound from England: On 4–5 September 1936, Beryl Markham, flying a Percival Vega Gull from Abingdon (then in Berkshire, now Oxfordshire), intended to fly to New York, but was forced down at Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, due to icing of fuel tank vents.
; First transatlantic passenger service on heavier-than air aircraft: on 24 June 1939, Pan American inaugurated transatlantic passenger service between New York and Marseilles, France, using Boeing 314 flying boats. On 8 July 1939, a service began between New York and Southampton as well. A single fare was US$375.00 ($ in dollars). Scheduled landplane flights started in October 1945.

===1940s===
; First transatlantic flight of non-rigid airships: On 1 June 1944, two K class blimps from Blimp Squadron 14 of the United States Navy (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by non-rigid airships. On 28 May 1944, the two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left South Weymouth, Massachusetts, and flew approximately 16 hours to Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland. From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to Lajes Field on Terceira Island in the Azores. The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to Craw Field in Port Lyautey (Kenitra), French Morocco.
;First jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic Ocean: On 14 July 1948, six de Havilland Vampire F3s of No. 54 Squadron RAF, commanded by Wing Commander D S Wilson-MacDonald, DSO, DFC, flew via Stornoway, Iceland, and Labrador to Montreal on the first leg of a goodwill tour of the U.S. and Canada.

===1950s===
; First jet aircraft to make a non-stop transatlantic flight: On 21 February 1951, an RAF English Electric Canberra B Mk 2 (serial number &quot;WD932&quot;) flown by Squadron Leader A Callard of the Aeroplane &amp; Armament Experimental Establishment, flew from Aldergrove Northern Ireland, to Gander, Newfoundland. The flight covered almost in 4h 37 m. The aircraft was being flown to the U.S. to act as a pattern aircraft for the Martin B-57 Canberra.
; First jet aircraft transatlantic passenger service: On 4 October 1958, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) flew the first jet airliner service using the de Havilland Comet, when &quot;G-APDC&quot; initiated the first transatlantic Comet 4 service and the first scheduled transatlantic passenger jet service in history, flying from London to New York with a stopover at Gander.

===1970s===
; First supersonic commercial flight across the Atlantic Ocean: On 21 January 1976, the Concorde jet made its first commercial flight. Supersonic flights were available until 2003.
; First transatlantic flight by balloon: The &quot;Double Eagle II&quot;, piloted by Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson, and Larry Newman, became the first balloon to cross the Atlantic Ocean when it landed 17 August 1978 in Miserey near Paris, 137 hours 6 minutes after leaving Presque Isle, Maine.
===1980s===
; First solo crossing by helicopter: Dick Smith, Bell Jetranger III, August 1982.

; First balloon crossing by a woman: In September 1986, Evelien Brink, her husband Henk and Willem Hageman completed the first transatlantic balloon flight by a European team and first with a woman aboard. The &quot;Dutch Viking&quot; () completed the journey from St. John’s, Newfoundland to Almere, Netherlands in 51 hours and 14 minutes. This bested the time set by the &quot;Double Eagle II&quot; significantly, though the &quot;Dutch Viking&quot; suffered a near-disastrous landing.

==Other early transatlantic flights==

* 15–17 July 1933: Lithuanians Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas were supposed to make a non-stop flight from New York City &quot;via&quot; Newfoundland to Kaunas in their aircraft named &quot;Lituanica&quot;, but crashed in the forests of Germany after 6,411 km of flying, only 650 km short of their final destination after a flying time 37 hours, 11 minutes. They carried the first transatlantic airmail consignment.
* 10 December 1936: Portuguese-American aviator Joseph Costa took off from the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport in a Lockheed Vega named &quot;Crystal City&quot;, attempting to cross the Atlantic and land in Portugal, via Brazil. His plane crashed just before a stopover in Rio de Janeiro, on 15 January 1937.
* 5 July 1937: Captain Harold Gray of Pan Am flew from Botwood, Newfoundland to Foynes, Ireland, in a Sikorsky S-42 flying boat as part of the first transatlantic commercial passenger test flights. On 6 July 1937, Captain Arthur Wilcockson of Imperial Airways flew from Foynes to Botwood, in a Short Empire class flying boat named &quot;Caledonia.&quot;
* 21 July 1938: The Short Mercury flew from Foynes, on the west coast of Ireland, to Boucherville, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, a flight of . The Short &quot;Maia&quot;, flown by Captain A.S. Wilcockson, took off carrying &quot;Mercury&quot; (piloted by Captain, later Air Vice Marshal Don Bennett).&quot;Mercury&quot; separated from the carrier aircraft to continue what was to become the first commercial non-stop east-to-west transatlantic flight by a heavier-than-air machine. This initial journey took 20 hrs 21 min at an average ground speed of 144 mph (232 km/h).
* 10 August 1938: The first non-stop flight with a long-range airliner from Berlin to New York was with a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor that flew Berlin-Staaken to Floyd Bennett in 24 hours, 56 minutes and did the return flight to Berlin-Tempelhof three days later in 19 hours, 47 minutes.

==Notable transatlantic flights of the 21st century==

* 2 May 2002: Lindbergh&#x27;s grandson, Erik Lindbergh, celebrated the 75th anniversary of the pioneering 1927 flight of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot; by duplicating the journey in a single engine, two seat Lancair Columbia 200. The younger Lindbergh&#x27;s solo flight from Republic Airport on Long Island, to Le Bourget Airport in Paris was completed in 17 hours and 7 minutes, or just a little more than half the time of his grandfather&#x27;s 33.5-hour original flight.
* 22–23 September 2011: Mike Blyth and Jean d&#x27;Assonville flew a Sling 4 prototype Light Sport Aircraft, registration ZU-TAF, non-stop from Cabo Frio International Airport, Brazil to Cape Town International Airport, South Africa, a distance of 6,222 km, in 27 hours. The crew set course for co-ordinates 34°S 31°W to take advantage of the westerly winds and at the turning point proceeded in an easterly direction, roughly following the 35°S parallel. This took them within 140 km north of the most remote inhabited island in the world, Tristan da Cunha. The Cabo Frio/Cape Town leg was part of an around the world flight.

==Failed transatlantic attempts of the 21st century==
In September 2013, Jonathan Trappe lifted off from Caribou, Maine, United States in an attempt to make the first crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by cluster balloon. The craft was essentially a small yellow lifeboat attached to 370 balloons filled with helium. A short time later, due to difficulty controlling the balloons, Trappe was forced to land near the town of York Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. Trappe had expected to arrive in Europe sometime between three and six days after liftoff.
The craft ascended by the dropping of ballast, and was to drift at an altitude of up to 25,000 ft (7.6 km). It was intended to follow wind currents toward Europe, the intended destination, although unpredictable wind currents could have forced the craft to North Africa or Norway. To descend, Trappe would have popped or released some of the balloons.
The last time the Atlantic was crossed by helium balloon was in 1984 by Colonel Joe Kittinger.

==Records==
The fastest transatlantic flight was done by a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird from New York to London in 1 hour 55 minutes in 1974. The fastest time for an airliner is 2 hours 53 minutes for JFK–London Heathrow by Concorde in 1996. The fastest JFK-LHR time for a subsonic airliner is 4 hours 56 minutes by a British Airways Boeing 747-400 in February 2020. The distance JFK-LHR is .

<doc id="669726" wikidata="Q745580" url="?curid=669726" title="Sweet Baby James">
<text>Sweet Baby James is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter James Taylor, released on February 1, 1970, by Warner Bros. Records. It reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart, and includes two of Taylor&#x27;s earliest successful singles: &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; and &quot;Country Road&quot;, which reached number three and number thirty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, respectively. This success made Taylor one of the most prominent figures in the emerging singer-songwriter movement.

At the 13th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year. It was listed at number 104 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and, in 2000, it was voted number 228 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.
In 2002, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Produced by Peter Asher, &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles, California, between December 8 and 17, 1969, at a cost of only $7,600 (US$ in dollars) out of a budget of $20,000. Taylor was &quot;essentially homeless&quot; at the time the album was recorded, either staying in Asher&#x27;s home or sleeping on a couch at the house of guitarist Danny Kortchmar, or anyone else who would have him.

The song &quot;Suite for 20 G&quot; was so named because Taylor was promised $20,000 (US$ in dollars) once the album was delivered. With one more song needed, he strung together three unfinished songs into a &quot;suite&quot; to complete the album.

The album produced two charting singles: &quot;Fire and Rain&quot; (b/w &quot;Anywhere Like Heaven&quot;), which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on October 31, 1970, and &quot;Country Road&quot; (b/w &quot;Sunny Skies&quot;), which peaked at number 37 on March 20, 1971. An additional single, &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; (b/w &quot;Suite for 20 G&quot;), did not chart.

==Critical reception==

Reviewing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1970, Gary von Tersch observed in the music &quot;echoes of the Band, the Byrds, country Dylan and folksified Dion&quot;, which Taylor manages to negotiate into a &quot;very listenable record that is all his own&quot;. &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau was harsher in his appraisal of the album, saying that &quot;Taylor&#x27;s vehement following bewilders me; as near as I can discern, he is just another poetizing simp. Even the production is conventional. For true believers only.&quot; In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s William Ruhlmann was more receptive to &quot;Taylor&#x27;s sense of wounded hopelessness&quot;, believing it reflected &quot;the pessimism and desperation of the 1960s hangover that was the early &#x27;70s&quot; and &quot;struck a chord with music fans, especially because of its attractive mixture of folk, country, gospel, and blues elements, all of them carefully understated and distanced.&quot;

==Accolades==
* In 2001, the TV network VH1 named &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; the 77th greatest album of all time.
* In 2003, the album was ranked number 104 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the position in the 2012 update to the list, and dropping to number 182 in the 2020 update.

<doc id="669728" wikidata="Q62569" url="?curid=669728" title="Rockaway, Queens">
<text>The Rockaway Peninsula, commonly referred to as The Rockaways or Rockaway, is a peninsula at the southern edge of the New York City borough of Queens on Long Island, New York. Relatively isolated from Manhattan and other more urban parts of the city, Rockaway became a popular summer retreat in the 1830s. It has since become a mixture of lower, middle, and upper-class neighborhoods. In the 2010s, it became one of the city&#x27;s most quickly gentrifying areas.

The peninsula is divided into nine neighborhoods or sections, with Riis Park in between two of such sections. From east to west, they are: 
*Far Rockaway, from the Nassau County line to Beach 32nd Street; 
*Bayswater, located to the northeast of Far Rockaway, along the southeastern shore of Jamaica Bay 
*Edgemere, from Beach 32nd Street to Beach 56th Street; 
*Arverne, from Beach 56th Street to Beach 77th Street; 
*Rockaway Beach, from 77th Street to Beach 97th Street; 
*Rockaway Park, from Beach 98th Street to Beach 126th Street; 
*Belle Harbor, from Beach 126th Street to Beach 141st Street; 
*Neponsit, Beach 141st Street to Beach 149th Street;
*Riis Park, Beach 149th Street to Beach 169th Street;
*Breezy Point, from Beach 169th to the western tip. This includes the smaller areas of Roxbury and Rockaway Point, as well as *Fort Tilden

The peninsula is part of Queens Community District 14 and is patrolled by the 100th and 101st Precincts of the New York City Police Department. As of 2020, the peninsula&#x27;s total population is estimated to be 124,185. All ZIP Codes in Rockaway begin with the three digits 116 and the central post office is in Far Rockaway.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Rockaway&quot; may have meant &quot;place of sands&quot; in the Munsee language of the Native American Lenape who occupied this area at the time of European contact in the early 17th century. Other spellings include Requarkie, Rechouwakie, Rechaweygh, Rechquaakie and Reckowacky, transliterated in Dutch and English by early colonists. The indigenous inhabitants of the Rockaways were the Canarsie Native Americans, a band of Lenape, whose name was associated with the geography. The name Reckowacky was used to distinguish the Rockaway village from other Mohegan villages; &quot;Reckowacky&quot; means &quot;lonely place&quot;, or &quot;place of waters bright&quot;. This area was mistakenly documented as occupied by a band of Mohawk people in a 1934 source; this Iroquoian-speaking tribe primarily occupied the Mohawk River valley in central New York, north and west of the Hudson River and Long Island.

Other interpretations of the peninsula&#x27;s indigenous name have also been proposed. One possible interpretation is &quot;Reckonwacky&quot;, which translates to &quot;the place of our own people&quot;, while another is &quot;Reckanawahaha&quot;, which translates to &quot;the place of laughing waters&quot;. Other phrases, such as &quot;lekau&quot; (sand) &quot;lechauwaak&quot; (fork or branch), also referred to the area&#x27;s geography.

==History==

===Early history===
In September 1609, Henry Hudson and his crew were the first Europeans recorded as seeing the area of the Rockaways and Jamaica Bay. Hudson was attempting to find the Northwest Passage. On September 11, Hudson sailed into the Upper New York Bay, and the following day began a journey up what is now called the Hudson River in his honor.

By 1639, the Mohegan tribe sold most of the Rockaways to the Dutch West India Company. In 1664, the English defeated the Dutch colony and took over their lands in present-day New York. In 1685, the band chief, &quot;Tackapoucha&quot;, and the English governor of the province agreed to sell the Rockaways to a Captain Palmer for 31 pounds sterling. The Rockaway Peninsula was originally designated as part of the Town of Hempstead, then a part of Queens County. Palmer and the Town of Hempstead disputed over who owned Rockaway, so in 1687 he sold the land to Richard Cornell, an iron master from Flushing. Cornell and his family lived on a homestead on what is now Central Avenue, near the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. At his death, Cornell was buried in a small family cemetery, Cornell Cemetery.

=== 19th century ===

The Cornell property was split into 46 lots in 1808 following a partition lawsuit. Several wealthy New Yorkers created the Rockaway Association, which brought many of the lots and started developing resorts in the area in 1833. Rockaway became a popular area for seaside hotels starting in the 1830s, with the first resort being founded at Far Rockaway in 1835.

In the 19th century, people traveled to the Rockaways by horse-drawn carriages or on horseback. A ferry powered by steam sailed from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn. The peninsula&#x27;s popularity grew in the 1880s with the construction of the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Rockaway Beach Branch to Long Island City and Flatbush Terminal (now Atlantic Terminal), which facilitated population growth.

In 1878, the eastern community of Bayswater was laid out. One of Bayswater&#x27;s early developers was William Trist Bailey, who had purchased the property. In 1893, much of Hog Island, a small sandbar island off the coast of Far Rockaway washed away in a hurricane. The remainder of the island eroded by 1902. Plates, along with older artifacts, still wash up along the shore of Rockaway Beach.

The Rockaway Peninsula was originally part of the Town of Hempstead, then a part of Queens County. In 1897, the central peninsular towns of Hammels (named after a local landowner, Louis Hammels) and Hollands merged, and were incorporated as the Village of Rockaway Beach. Rockaway split from the Town of Hempstead and along with the three western Queens townships of Jamaica, Flushing and Newtown plus Long Island City, formed the new borough of Queens, which was consolidated into Greater New York City in 1898 (the remainder of Hempstead Town, plus the two other eastern Queens townships of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay did not become part of the borough and ultimately split from Queens with the formation of neighboring Nassau County in 1899). The village of Rockaway Park became incorporated into the City of Greater New York on January 1, 1898.

===Early 20th century===
In the early 1900s, a new railroad station opened up the community and the rest of the peninsula to a broad range of the population. The wealthy no longer had a monopoly on the peninsula, and various amusement parks, stores, and resort hotels attracted people from all over the city to spend a day or a whole summer there. Much of the area was developed by James S. Remsen and William Wainwright. In this era, it became known as &quot;New York&#x27;s Playground&quot;. Around this time, Breezy Point in the Rockaways began as a neighborhood of summer beach bungalows; this kind of house became the most popular type of housing during the summer months. Even today, some of these remain, converted to provide modern amenities, although the vast majority were razed in urban renewal during the 1960s.

In 1900, a New York State judge ordered that the land west of Rockaway Park be put up for auction. Belle Harbor and adjacent Neponsit were bought by Edward P. Hatch, who sold it to the West Rockaway Land Company in 1907. Residential lots in Belle Harbor were auctioned off in 1915. Belle Harbor was named by the president of the West Rockaway Land Company, Frederick J. Lancaster, who had earlier developed the Rockaway neighborhood of Edgemere. In 1905, before Lancaster acquired the land, a group of men wishing to form a yacht club entered into a grant agreement with the West Rockaway Land Company. The group, which had named itself the Belle Harbor Yacht Club, bought property from the company for $4,000. The agreement included 200 square feet of land and thirty plots of upland. That same year, the group received corporation status from the State of New York and by 1908 began participating in its first interclub ocean races with some of the city&#x27;s other yacht clubs. A new street system, based on numbered streets with the prefix &quot;Beach&quot;, was laid out for the Rockaways in 1912 to help development.

The central-peninsula neighborhood of Hammels, along with the eastern communities of Arverne and Far Rockaway, tried to secede from the city several times, complaining that consolidation had brought high taxes and poor services. In 1915 and 1917, a bill approving the secession passed in the legislature but was vetoed by then-Mayor John Purroy Mitchel.

Rockaway&#x27;s famous amusement park, Rockaways&#x27; Playland, was built in 1901 and quickly became a major attraction for people around the region. With its growing popularity, concern over swimming etiquette became a problem and early in 1904, the Captain of the NYPD, Louis Kreuscher, issued rules for those using the beach, censoring the bathing suits to be worn, where photographs could be taken, and specifying that women in bathing suits were not allowed to leave the beachfront. The park was grand for its time. One of its most popular attractions, the Atom Smasher roller coaster, would be featured at the beginning of &quot;This is Cinerama&quot;, a pre-IMAX type movie, in 1952. An Olympic-size swimming pool and a million-dollar midway also were built within the amusement park; they would serve the community for more than 80 years. It was a popular place for New York families until 1985, when insurance costs and competition from major regional parks made it impossible to continue operations.

Arverne became well known as a beachfront community with inexpensive summer bungalows, and hotels of varying levels of expense and luxury as well as amusements and boardwalk concessions, and it also attracted a year-round residential community. One grandiose plan for the community included a canal running through the neighborhood, reminiscent of the Amstel canal in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The canal was never built; its right-of-way became Amstel Boulevard, which, except for a stub west of Beach 71st Street, was later incorporated into Beach Channel Drive.

The first transatlantic flight departed from Neponsit on the Rockaway Peninsula. On May 8, 1919, four United States Navy Curtis-model seaplanes took off from what is now Beach Channel Drive to Newfoundland, Canada, the Azores Islands, and Lisbon, Portugal. Finally, on May 31, 1919, one of the planes, piloted by Lt. Commander Albert C. Read, arrived in Plymouth, England.

===Robert Moses era===

In the 1930s, Robert Moses came to power as New York City&#x27;s Parks Commissioner and his extensive road and transportation projects were both a benefit and a disaster for the neighborhood. As commissioner, Moses ordered the construction of the Marine Parkway Bridge and the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge. The bridges were completed in 1937 and 1939 respectively. The Marine Parkway Bridge was built farther west on the peninsula between Jacob Riis Park and Breezy Point linking the isolated communities to Brooklyn. The Cross Bay Bridge landed in the middle of the neighborhood of Rockaway Beach. The construction of the two bridges started to transform the neighborhood and the rest of the peninsula into a more year-round residential area or commuter town, as people had a more convenient way to travel to and from work. The conversion of the Rockaway Beach LIRR branch to the Rockaway subway line also brought an increase to Rockaway&#x27;s permanent residents. Robert Caro, who wrote &quot;The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York&quot;, stated &quot;Why did the Rockaways end up with so much government-financed housing? Largely because Robert Moses wanted it there.&quot;

Although the bridges were intended to improve the Rockaways, Moses&#x27; other projects both directly and indirectly hurt the community. One such failed project was the planned construction of the Shore Front Parkway in the 1950s and 1960s. Wanting to connect Staten Island to the Hamptons, Moses focused on making a highway through the Rockaway Peninsula. His idea was to connect the Marine Parkway Bridge with the Atlantic Beach Bridge, which connected the Rockaway Peninsula to Nassau County. The plan would also provide an extension midway through to include the Cross Bay Bridge. Many feared that such an extensive project would do more harm to the peninsula than good and pointed to the community displacement that had happened in the South Bronx because of Moses&#x27; roadway construction Even though Moses never got to make his highway, he did leave his mark. A piece of the planned parkway that ran west to east in the Rockaway Park and Rockaway Beach neighborhoods was constructed and opened in 1939. Houses were cut in half to build the four-lane street. Some of these houses are still standing today. The existing, still unfinished street is locally known as the &quot;road from nowhere to nowhere&quot; because it does not have any relevant connections to any other area or highway.

Robert Moses&#x27; construction of other recreational areas and facilities, such as the New York Aquarium and Jones Beach State Park, indirectly affected the neighborhood as well. These more modern recreational facilities lured tourists and beachgoers away from the peninsula. With fewer customers, businesses and hotels closed, and by the 1950s, the area had fallen into economic decline. The transition from a summer vacationing area to a full-time residential neighborhood had taken its toll.

===Late 20th century===

After World War II, several large public housing projects were built in the region as part of Moses&#x27; overall citywide neighborhood redevelopment plans, but these eventually became hotbeds of crime and related social pathologies. This provoked a backlash from some of the peninsula&#x27;s more established residents (many of whom are of Irish Catholic heritage). A strong Jewish community (most of whose members are Ashkenazi Jews) also exists in and around Far Rockaway. For example, the city constructed the Hammel Houses in Rockaway Beach, one of the many urban renewal efforts that dominated the community and much of its eastern neighbors in the last half of the 20th century. The New York City Housing Authority purchased the land in 1952 on the north side of the elevated track. In 1964, the Authority decided to demolish and rebuild the entire area and turn it into a park.

With the advent of inexpensive travel, air-conditioning, John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the Interstate Highway system, Rockaway lost its luster as a recreation area, and development transformed much of it into residential communities.

In 1960, Breezy Point was sold to the Atlantic Improvement State Corporation for $17 million; the residents of the 3,500-home community purchased half of the land for about $11 million and formed the Breezy Point Cooperative. The construction of apartment buildings commenced in the late 1960s and was halted by City ordinance. At the same time, much of the housing in the area was converted into year-round housing for low-income residents, and some of the bungalows were used as public housing. In Arverne, the New York City Planning Commission approved the designation of a Arverne renewal area in 1964. However, for thirty years, the area went mostly undeveloped.

In 1998, Broad Channel&#x27;s Labor Day parade included a float that parodied the racially motivated dragging death of an African American man, James Byrd Jr. Entitled &quot;Black to the Future - Broad Channel in 2098&quot;, the float carried white men wearing blackface and Afro wigs, including two city firefighters and a city police officer who were fired from their jobs after their participation came to light. They sued the city for wrongful termination, and their claims were upheld in federal district court in 2003. Residents expressed support for and relief at the ruling, hoping that an end to the court battle would help to rehabilitate the image of the town. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the ruling in 2006, holding that the firings could stand.

===21st century===

After decades of grand redevelopment plans that fell through — for casinos, sports arenas, and other projects — planning began in 2002 for a large vacant section between Rockaway Beach and Arverne. By 2004, people were moving into the first completed buildings of the Arverne-By-the-Sea development. By 2012, the development included some 2,300 homes. That sparked nearby retail development. Far Rockaway Shopping Center, in downtown Far Rockaway between the Far Rockaway subway station, and the Far Rockaway LIRR station, got its first new store in decades. Phase I of construction was completed in 2011; Phase II was begun in 2006.

Elsewhere, along the beach, zoning laws written decades ago for the hotel trade have allowed developers to build high-rises alongside the smaller old and new houses. In response, some communities have approved rezoning plans for their neighborhoods to stop &quot;out of character&quot; development.

Opponents also contend that due to the rapidly growing population, the current infrastructure is inadequate and that there are environmental issues to consider. Those in favor of the development, however, contend that the development will help spur economic development and that the infrastructure cannot be upgraded until the population has reached a more noticeable level. Furthermore, some developers have questioned the legality of &quot;down zoning&quot;. On August 14, 2008, however, a rezoning plan that limits the size of some buildings was approved by the New York City Council for five communities on the peninsula covering 280 blocks. The communities that were included are Rockaway Park, Rockaway Beach, Somerville, Edgemere, and Far Rockaway.

With more and more people moving to the city, the Rockaways become a destination for adventurous day trippers. The area appears in New York Magazine&#x27;s 2007 spring travel issue as a place for &quot;male bonding&quot; and to &quot;scuba dive for sunken ships&quot; via Sheepshead Bay&#x27;s Jeanne II docks at Pier Five. Today, the area still draws crowds during the summer with well-tended beaches. Jacob Riis Park and Fort Tilden are situated towards the western end of the peninsula, and are part of the Gateway National Recreational Area, which was created in 1972 as one of the first urban national parks. The long Rockaway Boardwalk and of sandy beaches, fully accessible by the subway, make this a popular summer day trip for New York City residents. Toward the western end of the boardwalk, several portions of the beach are fenced off to preserve the nesting habitat for several species of terns and plovers, making for a unique urban birdwatching locale.

After 2010, there was a major resurgence in the Rockaways&#x27; popularity. Various media began reporting on artists such as Andrew VanWyngarden, co-founder of popular psychedelic rock band MGMT, purchasing homes on the beach. The peninsula was dubbed &quot;Williamsburg on the Rockaways&quot; because some surfers from there began to spend whole summers out in the Rockaways. A number of businesses that cater to them have become popular among these down for the day tourists. There is even a summer shuttle bus which transports people from Williamsburg to the Rockaways.

In February 2016, the Rockaway Peninsula was one of four neighborhoods featured in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about &quot;New York&#x27;s Next Hot Neighborhoods&quot;.

===Disasters and events===
====19th and 20th centuries====

Storms and fires damaged many of the attractions on the Rockaway Peninsula in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. On August 24, 1893, an intense storm, later classified as a hurricane, destroyed Hog Island, a mile-long island off the Rockaway coast that supported bath houses, restaurants and other leisure-time venues. On January 3, 1914, a violent storm devastated the peninsula, and swept the 1,200-seat Arverne Pier Theater away to sea. On June 15, 1922, much of Arverne was leveled by a fire that left about 10,000 people homeless, although the neighborhood was quick to rebuild.

On June 6, 1993, a ship called the &quot;Golden Venture&quot; beached near Fort Tilden on the western half of the Rockaway Peninsula. The ship contained 296 Chinese illegal immigrants, including 13 crew members. Ten people drowned trying to reach shore.

====2001 disasters====
Over 70 Rockaway residents were killed in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, including people who worked there and New York City Fire Department firefighters and EMS personnel dispatched to the location. The city later opened Tribute Park on Jamaica Bay north of the Beach 116th Street shopping area in Rockaway Park, dedicating it to their memory. In the center of the park is a piece of twisted steel from the ruins of the trade center&#x27;s Twin Towers. Solemn ceremonies are held at the park every September 11, including a reading of the names of all the locals who perished on that day.

Almost exactly two months after 9/11, on November 12, 2001, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in Belle Harbor, killing 265 people: 260 aboard the aircraft and five on the ground. Many of the passengers on the plane were from the Dominican community in Washington Heights, Manhattan. A temporary memorial was developed at the actual site of the disaster, on Newport Avenue. But after consultation with the families in the Belle Harbor and Washington Heights communities, a public memorial was erected at the south end of Beach 116th Street, a major shopping district and transportation hub in the area. Ceremonies commemorating the disaster are held at the memorial every November 12, including a reading of the names of all of those killed in the crash. In 2001, a resident told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to understand unless you live here ... Father Michael Geraghty, a priest quoted in the same article, said that it was common for people to live in the houses that their parents lived in and that many families lived in the same houses for generations. The neighborhood suffered heavy losses from the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.&quot; The impact of the 9/11 attacks and Flight 587 on the community was the subject of the book &quot;Braving the Waves: Rockaway Rises, and Rises Again&quot; by Kevin Boyle. The book contained many personal accounts of Rockaway residents and is interspersed with descriptions of other disasters in the Rockaways.

====Hurricane Sandy====
In October 2012, Rockaway was devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Many homes, especially in Breezy Point, were damaged or destroyed by high water, or by fires that raged beyond the capability of first responders to contain them. Residents lost everything in their basements, and hundreds of vehicles were ruined. One car caught fire when someone tried to start their vehicle, but residents put the fire out before official help arrived. On August 4, 2013, Senator Charles Schumer announced that the first phase of reconstruction on the beach, completed, would lay the groundwork for a second contract awarded later during the summer of 2013, totally paid for by the federal government through the Hurricane Sandy relief bill.
During the storm, a fire spread between the closely spaced houses of Breezy Point, while firefighters&#x27; access to the area was greatly hampered by flooding. It destroyed 126 homes and damaged 22 more. Thousands of other houses were damaged by the flooding. Fires also wreaked havoc along several blocks of Beach 130th Street in Belle Harbor, and among storefronts along Rockaway Beach Blvd. near Beach 114th Street in Rockaway Park. Large portions of the Rockaway Boardwalk were swept away by the floodwaters, leaving only its supporting piers. The FDNY found 130 homes burned to the ground. Nearby, another 50 homes were damaged by the fire. According to an official report in December, rising seawater caused the fire by contacting a house&#x27;s electrical wires. &quot;Whalemina,&quot; a large, brightly colored statue of a smiling whale that had been a beloved iconic symbol of Rockaway since the 1990s, disappeared from Beach 94th Street near the Boardwalk and was presumed to have been swept out to sea.

==Transportation==

Rockaway is served by multiple transportation services.

===Trains and subways===

The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Rockaway Line has two branches on the peninsula. The eastern branch, served by the , serves the eastern Rockaways and contains a terminal at Far Rockaway–Mott Avenue station. The western branch, served by the , serves the central Rockaways and terminates at Rockaway Park–Beach 116th Street station. The latter was the terminal of the former Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR).

The Far Rockaway terminal station for the LIRR&#x27;s Far Rockaway Branch is located in Far Rockaway. The branch had originally been part of a loop that traveled along the existing route, continuing through the Rockaway Peninsula and heading on a trestle across Jamaica Bay through Queens where it reconnected with other branches. Frequent fires and maintenance problems led the LIRR to abandon the Queens portion of the route, which was acquired by the city to become the IND Rockaway Line.

===Buses===
MTA Regional Bus Operations routes include local and Manhattan express buses . Also, Nassau Inter-County Express (NICE) routes include in Far Rockaway only. Unlike other NICE routes in Queens, these buses operate open-door in Far Rockaway, meaning customers can ride these buses wholly within the neighborhood without necessarily going to Nassau County. NYC Beach Bus, a privately operated shuttle bus between downtown Brooklyn or Williamsburg and the area around Beach 84th Street and Jacob Riis Park, also runs in the area. One can also take a converted former school bus named Rockabus from Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

===Ferry===
After Hurricane Sandy in October 2012 destroyed much of the IND Rockaway Line, ferry operator SeaStreak began running a city-subsidized ferry service between a makeshift ferry slip at Beach 108th Street and Beach Channel Drive in Rockaway Park and Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District, then continuing on to the East 34th Street Ferry Landing. In August 2013, a stop was added at Brooklyn Army Terminal. The service was extended multiple times. finally ending on October 31, 2014. On May 1, 2017, NYC Ferry&#x27;s Rockaway route started operations between Pier 11/Wall Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District and Beach 108th Street in Rockaway Park, with a stop at Brooklyn Army Terminal.

== Culture ==
The Rockaway Arts Council provides a wide range of events throughout the year. Two art groups in Rockaway, the Rockaway Theater Company and the Rockaway Artists&#x27; Alliance, hold most of their productions in Fort Tilden.

Cultural references include:
* Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Far Rockaway of the Heart&quot; (New Directions, 1998) 
* &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, a popular HBO series (2010-2014), was partially filmed at Fort Tilden and the Boardwalk, standing in for Atlantic City in the 1920s. 
* Jill Eisenstadt&#x27;s classic novel &quot;From Rockaway&quot; is set within the world of Rockaway&#x27;s lifeguard culture during the 1980s. Her 2017 novel, &quot;Swell&quot;, brings back some of the same characters over one eventful weekend in June 2002.
* In the early 1980s, Christine Lavin, a New York-based folk singer, wrote the poignant song &quot;Rockaway&quot; about her family home.
* Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Radio Days&quot;, a 1987 movie about a working-class family during the Golden Age of Radio, was filmed on location in Rockaway Park, with period facades and cars.
* Patricia Reilly Giff&#x27;s 1998 Newbery Award-winning novel &quot;Lily&#x27;s Crossing&quot; is set in the Rockaways. The story, about a girl&#x27;s friendship with a Hungarian refugee, was inspired by the author&#x27;s own childhood memories of Rockaway Beach during World War II. A companion book, &quot;Willow Run&quot;, features Rockaway as the home of Margaret Dillon, a child whose family moves in 1944 to Willow Run, Michigan (now between Ypsilanti, Michigan and Belleville, Michigan) to work at Henry Ford&#x27;s Willow Run B-24 Liberator bomber plant as part of the United States civilian war effort.
* Naomi Ragen&#x27;s 2002 semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Chains Around the Grass&quot; is set in a public housing project in Rockaway, reflecting Ragen&#x27;s own upbringing there.
* The 2010 documentary film &quot;Our Hawaii&quot;, by Kryssa Schemmerling, explores the surf culture that sprang up at Rockaway starting in the late 1960s.
* The Rockaways&#x27; distance from the heart of the city and seeming status as a sleepy, isolated, career-killing backwater far from the big-city hustle and bustle and professional challenge of police work in fast-track Manhattan was noted in a Season 8 episode of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (&quot;Thumb Enchanted Evening&quot;); dismayed by the news that detective squad leader Arthur Fancy has been promoted to captain and will soon leave the 15th Squad, Andy Sipowicz warns him that &quot;when you&#x27;re out in Far Rockaway, working some serial purse-snatcher, don&#x27;t say nobody warned you.&quot;
*On &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot;, Susie Meyerson is from Broad Channel Avenue in the Rockaways. 
* The Ramones&#x27; song &quot;Rockaway Beach&quot;, on their 1977 album &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, became the American punk rock group&#x27;s highest-charting single, peaking at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100. Written in the surf rock style of the Beach Boys and other similar bands, the song was composed by the group&#x27;s bassist, Dee Dee Ramone, who liked to spend time on the beach there. In 2013, the 36-year-old song was revived in a radio ad campaign aimed at promoting Rockaways&#x27; beaches as part of the peninsula&#x27;s post-Hurricane Sandy recovery effort.

<text>Die casting is a metal casting process that is characterized by forcing molten metal under high pressure into a mold cavity. The mold cavity is created using two hardened tool steel dies which have been machined into shape and work similarly to an injection mold during the process. Most die castings are made from non-ferrous metals, specifically zinc, copper, aluminium, magnesium, lead, pewter, and tin-based alloys. Depending on the type of metal being cast, a hot- or cold-chamber machine is used.

The casting equipment and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, which is why die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.

==History==
Die casting equipment was invented in 1838 for the purpose of producing movable type for the printing industry. The first die casting-related patent was granted in 1849 for a small hand-operated machine for the purpose of mechanized printing type production. In 1885 Ottmar Mergenthaler invented the Linotype machine, which cast an entire line of type as a single unit, using a die casting process. It nearly completely replaced setting type by hand in the publishing industry. The Soss die-casting machine, manufactured in Brooklyn, NY, was the first machine to be sold in the open market in North America. Other applications grew rapidly, with die casting facilitating the growth of consumer goods, and appliances, by greatly reducing the production cost of intricate parts in high volumes. In 1966, General Motors released the &quot;Acurad&quot; process.

==Cast metal==
The main die casting alloys are: zinc, aluminium, magnesium, copper, lead, and tin; although uncommon, ferrous die casting is also possible. Specific die casting alloys include: zinc aluminium; aluminium to, e.g. The Aluminum Association (AA) standards: AA 380, AA 384, AA 386, AA 390; and AZ91D magnesium. The following is a summary of the advantages of each alloy:

*Zinc: the easiest metal to cast; high ductility; high impact strength; easily plated; economical for small parts; promotes long die life.
*Aluminium: lightweight; high dimensional stability for very complex shapes and thin walls; good corrosion resistance; good mechanical properties; high thermal and electrical conductivity; retains strength at moderately high temperatures.
*Magnesium: the easiest metal to machine; excellent strength-to-weight ratio; lightest alloy commonly die cast.
*Copper: high hardness; high corrosion resistance; highest mechanical properties of alloys die cast; excellent wear resistance; excellent dimensional stability; strength approaching that of steel parts.
*Silicon tombac: high-strength alloy made of copper, zinc and silicon. Often used as an alternative for investment cast steel parts.
*Lead and tin: high density; extremely close dimensional accuracy; used for special forms of corrosion resistance. Such alloys are not used in foodservice applications for public health reasons. Type metal, an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper), is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds, now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.

, maximum weight limits for aluminium, brass, magnesium, and zinc castings are estimated at approximately , , , and , respectively. By late-2019, press machines capable of die casting single pieces over- were being used to produce aluminium chassis components for cars.

The material used defines the minimum section thickness and minimum draft required for a casting as outlined in the table below. The thickest section should be less than , but can be greater.

==Design geometry==

There are a number of geometric features to be considered when creating a parametric model of a die casting:
*Draft is the amount of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy ejection of the casting from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of the casting from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.
*Fillet is the curved juncture of two surfaces that would have otherwise met at a sharp corner or edge. Simply, fillets can be added to a die casting to remove undesirable edges and corners.
*Parting line represents the point at which two different sides of a mould come together. The location of the parting line defines which side of the die is the cover and which is the ejector.
*Bosses are added to die castings to serve as stand-offs and mounting points for parts that will need to be mounted. For maximum integrity and strength of the die casting, bosses must have universal wall thickness.
*Ribs are added to a die casting to provide added support for designs that require maximum strength without increased wall thickness.
*Holes and windows require special consideration when die casting because the perimeters of these features will grip to the die steel during solidification. To counteract this effect, generous draft should be added to hole and window features.

==Equipment==
There are two basic types of die casting machines: &quot;hot-chamber machines&quot; and &quot;cold-chamber machines&quot;. These are rated by how much clamping force they can apply. Typical ratings are between .

===Hot-chamber die casting===
Hot-chamber die casting, also known as &quot;gooseneck machines&quot;, rely upon a pool of molten metal to feed the die. At the beginning of the cycle the piston of the machine is retracted, which allows the molten metal to fill the &quot;gooseneck&quot;. The pneumatic- or hydraulic-powered piston then forces this metal out of the gooseneck into the die. The advantages of this system include fast cycle times (approximately 15 cycles a minute) and the convenience of melting the metal in the casting machine. The disadvantages of this system are that it is limited to use with low-melting point metals and that aluminium cannot be used because it picks up some of the iron while in the molten pool. Therefore, hot-chamber machines are primarily used with zinc-, tin-, and lead-based alloys.

===Cold-chamber die casting===
These are used when the casting alloy cannot be used in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large composition of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due to the need to transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.

==Mold or tooling==

Two dies are used in die casting; one is called the &quot;cover die half&quot; and the other the &quot;ejector die half&quot;. Where they meet is called the parting line. The cover die contains the sprue (for hot-chamber machines) or shot hole (for cold-chamber machines), which allows the molten metal to flow into the dies; this feature matches up with the injector nozzle on the hot-chamber machines or the shot chamber in the cold-chamber machines. The ejector die contains the ejector pins and usually the runner, which is the path from the sprue or shot hole to the mould cavity. The cover die is secured to the stationary, or front, platen of the casting machine, while the ejector die is attached to the movable platen. The mould cavity is cut into two &quot;cavity inserts&quot;, which are separate pieces that can be replaced relatively easily and bolt into the die halves.

The dies are designed so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die and stay in the ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that the casting will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the &quot;ejector pins&quot; to push the casting out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an &quot;ejector pin plate&quot;, which accurately drives all of the pins at the same time and with the same force, so that the casting is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting the casting to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because the casting is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting&#x27;s purpose.

Other die components include &quot;cores&quot; and &quot;slides&quot;. Cores are components that usually produce holes or opening, but they can be used to create other details as well. There are three types of cores: fixed, movable, and loose. Fixed cores are ones that are oriented parallel to the pull direction of the dies (i.e. the direction the dies open), therefore they are fixed, or permanently attached to the die. Movable cores are ones that are oriented in any other way than parallel to the pull direction. These cores must be removed from the die cavity after the shot solidifies, but before the dies open, using a separate mechanism. Slides are similar to movable cores, except they are used to form undercut surfaces. The use of movable cores and slides greatly increases the cost of the dies. Loose cores, also called &quot;pick-outs&quot;, are used to cast intricate features, such as threaded holes. These loose cores are inserted into the die by hand before each cycle and then ejected with the part at the end of the cycle. The core then must be removed by hand. Loose cores are the most expensive type of core, because of the extra labor and increased cycle time. Other features in the dies include water-cooling passages and vents along the parting lines. These vents are usually wide and thin (approximately ) so that when the molten metal starts filling them the metal quickly solidifies and minimizes scrap. No risers are used because the high pressure ensures a continuous feed of metal from the gate.

The most important material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly dependent on the temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.

The main failure mode for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are &quot;heat checking&quot; and &quot;thermal fatigue&quot;. Heat checking is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks occur on the die due to a large number of cycles.

==Process==
The following are the four steps in &quot;traditional die casting&quot;, also known as &quot;&quot;, these are also the basis for any of the die casting variations: die preparation, filling, ejection, and shakeout. The dies are prepared by spraying the mould cavity with lubricant. The lubricant both helps control the temperature of the die and it also assists in the removal of the casting. The dies are then closed and molten metal is injected into the dies under high pressure; between . Once the mould cavity is filled, the pressure is maintained until the casting solidifies. The dies are then opened and the shot (shots are different from castings because there can be multiple cavities in a die, yielding multiple castings per shot) is ejected by the ejector pins. Finally, the shakeout involves separating the scrap, which includes the gate, runners, sprues and flash, from the shot. This is often done using a special trim die in a power press or hydraulic press. Other methods of shaking out include sawing and grinding. A less labor-intensive method is to tumble shots if gates are thin and easily broken; separation of gates from finished parts must follow. This scrap is recycled by remelting it. The yield is approximately 67%.

The high-pressure injection leads to a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before any part of the casting solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mould is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process there will still be some porosity in the center of the casting.

Most die casters perform other secondary operations to produce features not readily castable, such as tapping a hole, polishing, plating, buffing, or painting.

===Inspection===
After the shakeout of the casting it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects can be caused by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. &quot;Flow marks&quot; are marks left on the surface of the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.

===Lubricants===
Water-based lubricants are the most used type of lubricant, because of health, environmental, and safety reasons. Unlike solvent-based lubricants, if water is properly treated to remove all minerals from it, it will not leave any by-product in the dies. If the water is not properly treated, then the minerals can cause surface defects and discontinuities.

Today &quot;water-in-oil&quot; and &quot;oil-in-water&quot; emulsions are used, because, when the lubricant is applied, the water cools the die surface by evaporating, hence depositing the oil that helps release the shot. A common mixture for this type of emulsion is thirty parts water to one part oil, however in extreme cases a ratio of one-hundred to one is used. Oils that are used include heavy residual oil (HRO), animal fat, vegetable fat, synthetic oil, and all sorts of mixtures of these. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, they form a thin film. Other substances are added to control the viscosity and thermal properties of these emulsions, e.g. graphite, aluminium, mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. In addition emulsifiers are added to improve the emulsion manufacturing process, e.g. soap, alcohol esters, ethylene oxides.

Historically, solvent-based lubricants, such as diesel fuel and kerosene, were commonly used. These were good at releasing the part from the die, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, which led to a build-up of carbon on the mould cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.

===Advantages===
Advantages of die casting:

*Excellent dimensional accuracy (dependent on casting material, but typically 0.1 mm for the first 2.5 cm (0.004 inch for the first inch) and 0.02 mm for each additional centimeter (0.002 inch for each additional inch).
*Smooth cast surfaces (Ra rms).
*Thinner walls can be cast as compared to sand and permanent mould casting (approximately ).
*Inserts can be cast-in (such as threaded inserts, heating elements, and high strength bearing surfaces).
*Reduces or eliminates secondary machining operations.
*Rapid production rates.
*Casting tensile strength as high as .
*Die casting fluid length is unaffected by solidification range, unlike permanent molds, sand castings, and other types.

===Disadvantages===

The main disadvantage to die casting is the very high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an economic process, a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are:
* The process is limited to high-fluidity metals. Increased scrap rates can be caused by fluidity failure, and scrap costs in die casting are high.
* Die casting involves a large number of parts, so questions of repeatability are particularly important.
* Casting weights have previously been limited to between 30 grams (1 oz) and 10 kg (20 lb), but from 2018 shots of have become possible.
* In the standard die casting process the final casting will have a small amount of porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. However, some companies have found ways of reducing the porosity of the part, allowing limited welding and heat treating. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.
* During the cooling process, some of the material stuffs the tiny crevices of the mold under pressure, which creates excess burrs that require extra work to trim.

==Variants==

=== Acurad ===
Acurad was a die casting process developed by General Motors in the late 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).

The thermal analysis was the first done for any casting process. This was done by creating an electrical analog of the thermal system. A cross-section of the dies were drawn on Teledeltos paper and then thermal loads and cooling patterns were drawn onto the paper. Water lines were represented by magnets of various sizes. The thermal conductivity was represented by the reciprocal of the resistivity of the paper.

The Acurad system employed a bottom fill system that required a stable flow-front. Logical thought processes and trial and error were used because computerized analysis did not exist yet; however this modeling was the precursor to computerized flow and fill modeling.

The Acurad system was the first die casting process that could successfully cast low-iron aluminium alloys, such as A356 and A357. In a traditional die casting process these alloys would solder to the die. Similarly, Acurad castings could be heat treated and meet the U.S. military specification .

Finally, the Acurad system employed a patented double shot piston design. The idea was to use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified around the perimeter of the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover that it was just as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.

===Pore-free===
When no porosity is allowed in a cast part then the pore-free casting process is used. It is identical to the standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mould cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when the molten metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.

===Vacuum-assisted high-pressure die casting===
In vacuum assisted high pressure die casting, a.k.a. vacuum high pressure die casting (VHPDC), a vacuum pump removes air and gases from die cavity and metal delivery system before and during injection. Vacuum die casting reduces porosity, allows heat treating and welding, improves surface finish, and can increase strength.

===Heated-manifold direct-injection===
Heated-manifold direct-injection die casting, also known as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the moulding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates, and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.

===Semi-solid===
&quot;Semi-solid die casting&quot; uses metal that is heated between its liquidus and solidus (or liquidus and eutectic temperature), so that it is in a &quot;mushy&quot; state. This allows for more complex parts and thinner walls.

=== Low-pressure die casting ===

Low-pressure die casting (LPDC) is a process developed to improve the consistency and integrity of parts, at the cost of a much slower cycle time. In LPDC, material is held in a reservoir below the die, from which it flows into the cavity when air pressure in the reservoir is increased. Typical pressures range from to . Somewhat higher pressures (up to ) may be applied after the material is in the die, to work it into fine details of the cavity and eliminate porosity.

Typical cycle times for a low-pressure die casting process are longer than for other die-casting processes; an engine block can take up to fifteen minutes. It is primarily used for aluminum, but has been used for carbon steel as well.

=== Integrated die casting ===
Integrated die casting refers to the high-level integration of multiple separate and dispersed alloy parts through a large-tonnage die-casting machine, and then formed into 1–2 large castings. The aim is to reduce manufacturing costs through one-time molding, significantly decreasing the number of parts needed for car assembly and improving overall efficiency. Elon Musk&#x27;s team first proposed this processing method during the Tesla manufacturing process which is Giga Press program.

<text>Brendan Airways, LLC, doing business as USA3000 Airlines, was a U.S. airline headquartered in Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. It operated both scheduled and charter service with a fleet of five Airbus A320 aircraft. The airline&#x27;s last flight departed on January 30, 2012.

==History==
===Launch &amp; Apple Vacation Charters: 2000–2002===
USA 3000 Airlines began operations with one Airbus A320. The inaugural flight on December 28, 2001, flew from Philadelphia to Cancun. By early 2002, USA 3000 Airlines exclusively operated charter flights, from Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford and Columbus, with two aircraft. A third aircraft was added to the fleet in 2002 and based at Chicago O’Hare International Airport.

===Expansion &amp; Scheduled service: 2003–2007===
In order for USA 3000 to generate additional revenue, the existing charter flights were also offered as scheduled, allowing passengers to book flights without purchasing an Apple Vacation package.

In 2003, additional scheduled service was launched from northeastern U.S. cities to Florida, Bermuda, and throughout the Caribbean. Scheduled domestic destinations eventually included Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, St. Petersburg/Clearwater, Orlando, Melbourne, Florida, and Sarasota. Northern cities or &quot;Gateway cities&quot; included Newark, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago (O&#x27;Hare), and St. Louis. Additionally, USA 3000 offered seasonal service from Hartford, Boston, and Milwaukee.
By late 2004, USA 3000 Airlines operated 12 permanent A320 aircraft, plus 2 additional seasonal aircraft leased from Thomas Cook Airlines.

===Cutbacks &amp; Military Charters: 2008–2012===
In early 2008, it was announced that USA 3000 Airlines would be pulling out of Newark Liberty Airport due to increased competition from discount carriers.

By Summer 2008, USA3000 Airlines began a major reduction of its Florida service, closing all stations except Fort Myers. USA3000 has cited record-high fuel prices as reason for the service cuts. According to former USA 3000 COO Angus Kinnear, &quot;Florida has some of the lowest domestic air fares in the country and only Fort Myers fetches ticket prices high enough to make money with oil at $125 a barrel.&quot; In the same announcement, the airline confirmed the continuation of its remaining scheduled service, with a strong focus on maintaining the more profitable international routes. However seasonal service was restored in late 2008 to St. Petersburg/Clearwater Airport from Chicago (O&#x27;Hare) due to a decrease in oil prices, reduction in flights by competitors, and a demonstration of customer support.

In November 2008, Steven Harfst was named CEO.

In January 2009, USA 3000 submitted a Statement of Intent to the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) based at Scott Air Force Base to be certified into the country&#x27;s Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). USA 3000 became a certified CRAF air carrier, and was able to bid on the military&#x27;s domestic and short-range international charters. USA 3000 also sought “Ad Hoc” charter opportunities to improve aircraft utilization and enhanced their website to improve sales, customer service, and ancillary revenue opportunities.

USA 3000 ended all of its services from Detroit and Milwaukee in April 2009. citing poor demand and the economic downturn. USA 3000 also ended service from Baltimore and Pittsburgh later that summer for the same reasons. However, those services were later offered seasonally, with USA3000 restoring service to Detroit in October 2009.

The Fort Myers crew base closed in March 2010. However, flight schedules from Southwest Florida International Airport were not impacted, according to the USA 3000 CEO.

In 2011, USA 3000 operated a fleet of 5 Airbus A320 aircraft.

In November 2011, Apple Vacations decided to dissolve USA 3000 Airlines. Apple Vacations subsequently used other carriers such as Frontier Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, AirTran Airways, Alaska Airlines and Aeroméxico to transport its customers to the Caribbean and Central America.

The airline&#x27;s last scheduled flight arrived on January 30, 2012. The airline intended to serve all existing charters through September 2012.

As of February 1, 2019 USA3000 still retains their website, not showing much but a basic WordPress page.

<doc id="669746" wikidata="Q738031" url="?curid=669746" title="Park and ride">
<text>A park and ride, also known as incentive parking or a commuter lot, is a parking lot with public transport connections that allows commuters and other people heading to city centres to leave their vehicles and transfer to a bus, rail system (rapid transit, light rail, or commuter rail), or carpool for the remainder of the journey. The vehicle is left in the parking lot during the day and retrieved when the owner returns. Park and rides are generally located in the suburbs of metropolitan areas or on the outer edges of large cities. A park and ride that only offers parking for meeting a carpool and not connections to public transport may also be called a park and pool.

Park and ride is abbreviated as &quot;P+R&quot; on road signs in some countries, and is often styled as &quot;Park &amp; Ride&quot; in marketing.

==Adoption==
In Sweden, a tax has been introduced on the benefit of free or cheap parking paid by an employer, if workers would otherwise have to pay. The tax has reduced the number of workers driving into the inner city, and increased the usage of park and ride areas, especially in Stockholm. The introduction of a congestion tax in Stockholm has further increased the usage of park and ride.

In Prague, park and ride parking lots are established near some metro and railway stations (about 17 parks near 12 metro stations and 3 train stations, in 2011). These parking lots offer low prices and all-day and return (2× 75 min) tickets including the public transport fare.

==Benefits==
Park and ride facilities allow commuters to avoid a stressful drive along congested roads and a search for scarce, expensive city-centre parking. They may well reduce congestion by assisting the use of public transport in congested urban areas.

There is not much research on the pros and cons of park and ride schemes. It has been suggested that there is &quot;a lack of clear-cut evidence
for park and ride&#x27;s widely assumed impact in reducing congestion&quot;.

Park and ride facilities help commuters who live beyond practical walking distance from the railway station or bus stop. They may also suit commuters with alternative fuel vehicles, which often have reduced range, when the facility is closer to home than the ultimate destination. They also are useful as a fixed meeting place for those carsharing, carpooling, or using &quot;kiss and ride&quot; (see below). Also, some transit operators use park and ride facilities to encourage more efficient driving practices by reserving parking spaces for low emission designs, high-occupancy vehicles, or carsharing.

Many park and rides have passenger waiting areas and/or toilets. Travel information, such as leaflets and posters, may be provided. At larger facilities, extra services such as a travel office, food shop, car wash, or cafeteria may be provided. These are often encouraged by municipal operators to encourage use of park and ride.
==Bus park and rides==

Park and ride facilities, with dedicated parking lots and bus services, began in the 1960s in the UK. Oxford operated the first such scheme, initially with an experimental service operating part-time from a motel on the A34 in the 1960s and then on a full-time basis from 1973. Better Choice Parking first offered an airport park and ride service at London Gatwick Airport in 1978. Oxford now operates park and ride from 5 dedicated parking lots around the city. As of 2015, Oxford has the biggest urban park &amp; ride network in the UK with a combined capacity of 5,031 car parking spaces.

==Railway park and rides==

Some railway stations are promoted as a park and ride facility for a town a few miles away, for instance for Looe and St Erth for St  Ives, both in Cornwall, England, and Norden for Swanage, Dorset, England (by steam railway). These help relieve traffic congestion and parking problems in the town. In contrast, some stations act as a railhead, easily accessed by road, for long-distance traffic. Names of stations in the UK with large car parks outside the main urban area are often suffixed with &quot;Parkway&quot;, such as , , and . At and , the stations are there to serve air as well as road passengers.

In the United States, it is common for outlying rail stations to include automobile parking, often with hundreds of spaces.

== Bike and ride ==

B &amp; R (B + R) is a name for using cycle boxes or racks near public transport terminals, mostly together with P &amp; R parking lots. This system can be promoted through integrated fare and tickets with public transport system.

== Kiss and ride / kiss and fly==
Many railway stations and airports feature a &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; or &quot;kiss-and-fly&quot; area in which cars can stop briefly to discharge or, less commonly, pick up passengers. The term first appeared in a 20 January 1956 report in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. It refers to the nominal scenario whereby a passenger is driven to the station by spouse or partner, then they kiss each other goodbye before the passenger catches the train.

Deutsche Bahn has announced that it will be changing the English expressions for Kiss and Ride, Service Points and Counters to German ones. In Italy the new Bologna Centrale railway station uses &quot;kiss and ride&quot; signs. Some high-speed railway stations in Taiwan have signs outside stations reading &quot;Kiss and Ride&quot; in English, with Chinese characters above the words that read &quot;temporary pick-up and drop-off zone&quot;. Kiss and Rides are getting popular in Poland. Cities with such areas include Wrocław (since October 2011), Kraków (since 15 November 2013), Warsaw (since 2016), and Toruń (since 2016). Locally they are known by their English name, i.e. &quot;Kiss and ride&quot; and while the sign is non-standardized, all of them contain the letters K+R. In the Netherlands, many English terms appear in the Dutch language, and &quot;Kiss &amp; Ride&quot; is one of them.

==Car-share park and rides==
Park and ride schemes do not necessarily involve public transport. They can be provided to reduce the number of cars on the road by promoting carpooling, vanpooling, and carsharing. Partly because of the concentration of riders, and thus a reduced number of vehicles, these park and ride terminals often have express transit services into the urban area, such as a high-occupancy vehicle lane. The service may take passengers in only one direction in the morning (typically towards a central business district) and in the opposite direction in the evening, with no or a limited number of trips available in the middle of the day. It is often not allowed to park at these locations overnight. These attributes vary from region to region, reflecting local transportation policies and commuter needs.

<doc id="669752" wikidata="Q912791" url="?curid=669752" title="Brian Moore (novelist)">
<text>Brian Moore ( ; 25 August 1921 – 11 January 1999), was a novelist and screenwriter from Northern Ireland who emigrated to Canada and later lived in the United States. He was acclaimed for the descriptions in his novels of life in Northern Ireland during and after the Second World War, in particular his explorations of the inter-communal divisions of The Troubles, and has been described as &quot;one of the few genuine masters of the contemporary novel&quot;. He was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1975 and the inaugural &quot;Sunday Express&quot; Book of the Year award in 1987, and he was shortlisted for the Booker Prize three times (in 1976, 1987 and 1990). Moore also wrote screenplays and several of his books were made into films.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born and grew up in Belfast with eight siblings in a large Roman Catholic family. His grandfather, a severe, authoritarian solicitor, had been a Catholic convert. His father, James Bernard Moore, was a prominent surgeon and an observant Catholic and his mother, Eileen McFadden Moore, a farmer&#x27;s daughter from County Donegal, was a nurse. His uncle was the prominent Irish nationalist Eoin MacNeill, founder of Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League) and Professor of Irish at University College Dublin.

Moore was educated at Newington Elementary School and St Malachy&#x27;s College, Belfast. He left the college in 1939, having failed his senior exams. The physical description of the school at the heart of &quot;The Feast of Lupercal&quot; matches closely that of Moore&#x27;s alma mater and is widely held to be a lightly fictionalised setting of the college as he unfondly remembered it.

==Wartime service and move to North America==
Moore was a volunteer air raid warden during the Second World War and served during the Belfast Blitz in April and May 1941. He went on to serve as a civilian with the British Army in North Africa, Italy and France. After the war ended he worked in Eastern Europe for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.

in 1948 he emigrated to Canada to work as a reporter for the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, and became a Canadian citizen. Moore lived in Canada from 1948 to 1958, moving to New York in 1959 to take up a Guggenheim Fellowship and remaining there until his divorce in 1967. He then moved to the west coast of the United States, settling in Malibu, California, with his new wife Jean. He taught creative writing at UCLA. While eventually making his primary residence in California, Moore continued to live part of each year in Canada up to his death.

==Novels and themes==
Moore wrote his first novels in Canada. His earliest books were thrillers, published under his own name or using the pseudonyms Bernard Mara or Michael Bryan. The first two of these pieces of pulp fiction, all of which he later disowned, were published in Canada by Harlequin – &quot;Wreath for a Redhead&quot; in March 1951 and &quot;The Executioners&quot; in July 1951.

&quot;Judith Hearne&quot;, which Moore regarded as his first novel and was the first he produced outside the thriller genre, remains among his most highly regarded. The book was rejected by ten American publishers before being accepted by a British publisher. It was made into a film, with British actress Maggie Smith playing the lonely spinster who is the book/film&#x27;s title character.

Other novels by Moore were adapted for the screen, including &quot;Intent to Kill&quot;, &quot;The Luck of Ginger Coffey&quot;, &quot;Catholics&quot;, &quot;Black Robe&quot;, &quot;Cold Heaven&quot;, and &quot;The Statement&quot;. He co-wrote the screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;, and wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Blood of Others&quot;, based on the novel &quot;Le Sang des autres&quot; by Simone de Beauvoir.

Moore criticised his Belfast schooling through his novels &quot;The Feast of Lupercal&quot; and &quot;The Emperor of Ice-Cream&quot;.

Some of his novels feature staunchly anti-doctrinaire and anti-clerical themes, and in particular, he spoke strongly about the effect of the Church on life in Ireland. A recurring theme in his novels is the concept of the Catholic priesthood. On several occasions, he explores the idea of a priest losing his faith. At the same time, several of his novels are deeply sympathetic and affirming portrayals of the struggles of faith and religious commitment, &quot;Black Robe&quot; most prominently.

==Acclaim==

Graham Greene said that Moore was his favourite living novelist, though Moore began to regard the label as &quot;a bit of an albatross&quot;.

==Personal life==
Moore was married twice. His first marriage, in 1952, was to Jacqueline (&quot;Jackie&quot;) Sirois (&quot;née&quot; Scully), a French Canadian and fellow journalist with whom he had a son, Michael (who became a professional photographer), in 1953. They divorced in October 1967 and Jackie died in January 1976. Moore married his second wife, Jean Russell (&quot;née&quot; Denney), a former commentator on Canadian TV, in October 1967.

Moore&#x27;s beachside house in Malibu, California was celebrated in Seamus Heaney&#x27;s poem &quot;Remembering Malibu&quot;. Moore&#x27;s widow, Jean, lived in the house until it was destroyed in 2018 in the Woolsey Fire.

==Death==
Brian Moore died at his Malibu home on 11 January 1999, aged 77, from pulmonary fibrosis. He had been working on a novel about the 19th-century French symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud. His last published work, written just before his death, was an essay entitled &quot;Going Home&quot;. It was a reflection inspired by a visit he made to the grave in Connemara of his family friend, the Irish nationalist Bulmer Hobson. The essay was commissioned by &quot;Granta&quot; and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 7 February 1999. Despite Moore&#x27;s often conflicted attitude to Ireland and his Irishness, his concluding reflection in the piece was &quot;The past is buried until, in Connemara, the sight of Bulmer Hobson&#x27;s grave brings back those faces, those scenes, those sounds and smells which now live only in my memory. And in that moment I know that when I die I would like to come home at last to be buried here in this quiet place among the grazing cows.&quot;

==Legacy==

In 1996, the Creative Writers Network in Northern Ireland launched the Brian Moore Short Story Awards. The awards scheme continued until 2008 and is now defunct.

Moore has been the subject of two biographies: &quot;Brian Moore: The Chameleon Novelist&quot; (1998) by Denis Sampson and &quot;Brian Moore: A Biography&quot; (2002) by Patricia Craig. &quot;Brian Moore and the Meaning of the Past&quot; (2007) by Patrick Hicks provides a critical retrospective of Moore&#x27;s works. Information about the publishing of Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;Judith Hearne&quot;, and the break-up of his marriage can be found in Diana Athill&#x27;s memoir &quot;Stet&quot; (2000).

In 1975, Moore arranged for his literary materials, letters and documents to be deposited in the Special Collections Division of the University of Calgary Library, an inventory of which was published by the University of Calgary Press in 1987. Moore&#x27;s archives, which include unfilmed screenplays, drafts of various novels, working notes, a 42-volume journal (1957–1998), and his correspondence , are now at The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, at the University of Texas at Austin.

To mark the centenary in 2021 of Moore&#x27;s birth, a project − Brian Moore at 100 − funded by a British Academy/Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grant, sought to re-appraise his work, and revive scholarly and public interest in it. The project included a programme of research, public-facing events and an international academic conference.

In 2023 an Ulster History Circle blue plaque was unveiled by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, close to where Moore was born.

<text>Webb and Knapp was a real estate development firm.

The company is most famous for developing the Roosevelt Airfield, which was the launching site of the transatlantic flights of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. It was also the firm at which famed architect I. M. Pei first worked from 1948 to 1956.

==History==
The company was founded in 1922 by Robert C. Knapp and W. Seward Webb.

William Zeckendorf joined the firm in 1938 and acquired it in 1949.

In the 1960s, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and Roosevelt Airfield was sold to Corporate Property Investors. The company at that time had total assets of about $21,500,00 and total liabilities of about $60 million, plus contingent tax liabilities of $29,400,000.

<text>William Zeckendorf Sr. (June 30, 1905 – September 30, 1976) was a prominent American real estate developer. Through his development company Webb and Knapp — for which he began working in 1938 and which he purchased in 1949 — he developed a significant portion of the New York City urban landscape. Architects I. M. Pei and Le Corbusier designed structures for Zeckendorf&#x27;s development projects.

==Early life==
Zeckendorf was born to a Jewish family in Paris, Illinois, the son of a hardware store manager. His family moved to New York City when he was three years old. He attended New York University but dropped out to work at the real estate company of his uncle, Sam Borchard. He soon left his uncle&#x27;s firm to work for Webb &amp; Knapp, a small New York building manager and brokerage.

==Career==
Zeckendorf&#x27;s most notable property acquisition, and potential development of a &quot;dream city&quot; to rival Rockefeller Center, was a site along the East River between 42nd Street and 48th Street. In a now celebrated transaction in December 1946, the prominent architect Wallace Harrison and Nelson Rockefeller bought the site from him for $8.5 million ($ million in ) and Nelson&#x27;s father John D. Rockefeller Jr. subsequently donated this land for the building of the United Nations Headquarters.

Zeckendorf also owned New York&#x27;s famous Chrysler Building and the venerable Hotel Astor in Times Square as well as the Commodore Hotel, the Drake Hotel, Hotel Manhattan and the Chatham Hotel. He purchased Chicago&#x27;s famous Robie House in 1958, before transferring ownership to the University of Chicago. He developed two of I. M. Pei&#x27;s early skyscrapers — the Mile High Center (now part of Wells Fargo Center) in downtown Denver, and Place Ville Marie in downtown Montreal.

Zeckendorf also partnered with Chicago real estate titan Arthur Rubloff to develop a stretch of Michigan Avenue into what Rubloff dubbed the Magnificent Mile. The Rubloff Company was eventually acquired by Prudential and subsequently has become a division of Berkshire Hathaway.

The real estate tycoon and his company, Webb &amp; Knapp, also were involved in theme park investment following the successful debut of Disneyland. Zeckendorf came to know C.V. Wood, who first helped build Disneyland as a Disney employee and then developed theme parks in Colorado, Massachusetts, New York (on Zeckendorf&#x27;s property) and Texas under his own Marco Engineering company. Zeckendorf and his company enjoyed various connections to the Marco Engineering parks.

In New York, Wood created and built Freedomland U.S.A. on marshland that had been owned by Zeckendorf since the early 1950s. The property was located in The Bronx, a borough of New York City. The park lasted just five years (1960–1964) and it was under various layers of management that included Zeckendorf and his son. According to Zeckendorf in a newspaper article that appeared during 1970, the theme park, unknown to the public at the time, served as a &quot;placeholder&quot; for the land to obtain variances that permitted the construction on the marshland of the world&#x27;s largest co-operative housing project known as Co-op City. Zeckendorf&#x27;s ownership of the land and his role in Freedomland are documented in the book &quot;Freedomland U.S.A.: The Definitive History&quot; (Theme Park Press, 2019).

==Deal with Spyros Skouras==
In December 1958, Zeckendorf entered into a deal with Spyros Skouras, head of 20th Century-Fox, to purchase Fox&#x27;s project to develop of its historic backlot in Los Angeles, California, into a proposed Century City. The studio had suffered a string of expensive flops, culminating in the box-office disaster &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963) and was in dire need of money. The project, conceived under the direction of Edmund Herrscher, the studio&#x27;s director of property development, had been announced the first week of 1958, with construction said to begin in July 1958.

However, construction did not start as promised, and rumors, later confirmed, circulated that developer Zeckendorf would take over the project by purchasing 20th&#x27;s interest in the project for . The following March it was announced that construction would begin that month on the new headquarters for architect Welton Becket, chief architect on the project That did not occur either. Zeckendorf hired New York public relations executive Tex McCrary to lend new life and visibility to the project. McCrary, in turn contracted with Los Angeles publicist Charles A. Pomerantz, well known in the entertainment industry, to come up with a campaign and execute it.

Pomerantz turned to a young publicist he had hired, Worley Thorne, the only other publicist in the small firm, for suggestions. Thorne said he&#x27;d call friends in the press to assess their attitudes. Thorne learned that there was deep skepticism that the project would ever be built. 20th did not have the money, which is why they brought in Zeckendorf, but apparently Zeckendorf was unable to deliver even the $53-million purchase price, let alone $400 million. The California papers had already given a lot of publicity to Century City and, for them, any more coverage would just be re-hash in which they were not interested.

Thorne reported to Pomerantz his opinion that the only way to restore credibility to the project was to actually &quot;begin&quot; construction, and Pomerantz went for the plan. Thorne called Herrscher and asked if there was some small building they could demolish with a bulldozer, to begin to &quot;break ground&quot; for the Becket building. Herrscher said there was a tin shack that was expendable and he&#x27;d make it available, as well as the bulldozer. McCrary and William Zeckendorf, Jr., vice-president of Webb &amp; Knapp, also approved. Thorne said that it should be a large affair with the mayors of Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica, plus politicians and other dignitaries, invited, as well as all the Southern California press. He and Pomerantz would find a star to &quot;launch&quot; the project by breaking a bottle of champagne on the shack prior to its being demolished. Later, they secured Mary Pickford for that task. It was all purely symbolic, since construction did not actually begin, but no one stated that openly, it was dramatic, and very successful. &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; devoted almost three full pages to its coverage of the event.

Still lacking sufficient money, Zeckendorf was forced to make per day penalty payments to Fox. In 1960, Zeckendorf solved his problem by partnering with Alcoa in a joint-venture relationship to finally build Century City, which by now had escalated to a project. The new owners embraced the studio&#x27;s conception of Century City as &quot;a city within a city&quot; with the arc-shaped, 19-story Century Plaza Hotel to be the centerpiece. This joint-venture marked an increasing interest by large corporations with land &quot;surplus&quot; in order to create housing communities, industrial parks and office buildings; marking the first movement from traditional industry into real estate investing.

==Bankruptcy==
Before his company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1965, Zeckendorf became the embodiment of glamorous real-estate dealmaking, which included developing Roosevelt Airfield, where Charles Lindbergh began his transatlantic flight, and helping to advance and develop Long Island University. From the start of his career Zeckendorf had been able to use his dealmaking skills to acquire or build projects for which he lacked the funds, but in time the under-funding caught up with him, and &quot;his overextended company crashed in a spectacular bankruptcy.&quot;

==Personal life==
Zeckendorf was married four times. His first wife was Irma Levy; they had two children: William Zeckendorf Jr. and Susan Zeckendorf Nicholson. They later divorced and she remarried to the music critic and historian Irving Kolodin. His second wife was Marion Griffin who died in 1968. In 1972, he married Alice Odenheimer Bache, widow of Harold L. Bache. They subsequently divorced and he married Louise Betterly Malcolm in 1975.

On September 30, 1976, William Zeckendorf died in his residence on 65th Street and Park Avenue after suffering a stroke.

<doc id="669774" wikidata="Q7644216" url="?curid=669774" title="Superstar USA">
<text>The WB&#x27;s Superstar USA is a television show that spoofed the popular show &quot;American Idol&quot; and aired on The WB in 2004. Essentially its polar opposite, &quot;Superstar USA&quot; judges told contestants they were looking for the best singer when in fact they were secretly looking for the worst.

==Description==
Hosted by Brian McFayden, people first audition before three judges (Christopher Briggs, who also produced the show; rapper Tone Loc and singer Vitamin C) in four cities across the United States. Finalists were chosen based on the lie that they were the most likely to be able to parlay their win into a successful recording contract based on talent. However, the audition process was the opposite of &quot;American Idol&quot; as good singers were mocked and rejected while bad singers were given gushing praise and passed to the next round.

Eventually the contest was &quot;won&quot; by Jamie Foss, who could barely carry a tune. Throughout the competition she was constantly mocked by judges with thinly veiled references to the largeness of her breasts. She was awarded $50,000 in cash and a $50,000 budget to produce a record, which never surfaced. The truth was revealed to her on stage in front of the audience she had just sung for.

One producer, worried that the live audience members would be unable to respectfully compose themselves during the final performances, falsely informed them that the singers were all terminally ill young people who were having a wish fulfilled by a charitable organization. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported the said organization as the Make a Wish Foundation, which later received an apology from the WB. In an interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, executive producer Mike Fleiss straightened out the details: &quot;First of all, it was me. But I did not say &#x27;Make-A-Wish.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Who&#x27;s heard of the One Wish Foundation?&#x27; and people raised their hands. There is no One Wish Foundation. It was a prank on top of a prank. It was the only way to get it to work.&quot;

<doc id="669801" wikidata="Q929923" url="?curid=669801" title="Toy soldier">
<text>A toy soldier is a miniature figurine that represents a soldier. The term applies to depictions of uniformed military personnel from all eras, and includes knights, cowboys, American Indians, pirates, samurai, and other subjects that involve combat-related themes. Toy soldiers vary from simple playthings to highly realistic and detailed models. The latter are of more recent development and are sometimes called model figures to distinguish them from traditional toy soldiers. Larger scale toys such as dolls and action figures may come in military uniforms, but they are not generally considered toy soldiers.

Toy soldiers are made from all types of material, but the most common mass-produced varieties are metal and plastic. There are many different kinds of toy soldiers, including tin soldiers or &quot;flats&quot;, hollow-cast metal figures, composition figures, and plastic army men. Metal toy soldiers were traditionally sold in sets; plastic figures were sold in toy shops individually in Britain and Europe and in large boxed sets in the U.S. Modern, collectable figures are often sold individually.

==Scale==
Scale for toy soldiers is expressed as the soldier&#x27;s approximate height from head to foot in millimeters. Because many figures do not stand up straight, height is usually an approximation. Standard toy soldier scale, originally adopted by W. Britain, is 54 mm (2.25 inches) or 1:32 scale. Among different manufacturers, standard scale may range from 50 mm or 1:35 scale, to 60 mm or 1:28 scale. For gamers and miniatures enthusiasts, 25 mm and even smaller scales are available. On the larger end of the scale are American dimestore figures, and many of the toy soldiers produced in Germany, which are approximately 75 mm (3 inches) or 1:24 scale.

==History==
Tin soldiers were produced in Germany as early as the 1730s, by molding the metal between two pieces of slate. Toy soldiers became widespread during the 18th century, inspired by the military exploits of Frederick the Great. Miniature soldiers were also used in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries by military strategists to plan battle tactics by using the figures to show the locations of real soldiers. In 1893, the British toy company William Britain revolutionized the production of toy soldiers by devising the method of hollow casting, making soldiers that were cheaper and lighter than their German counterparts.

In addition to Britains, there have been many other manufacturers of toy soldiers over the years. For example, John Hill &amp; Company produced hollow cast lead figures in the same style and scale. Companies such as Elastolin and Lineol were well known for their composite figures made of glue and sawdust that included both military and civilian subjects. After 1950, rising production costs and the development of plastic meant that many shop keepers liked the lighter, cheaper, and far less prone to break in transit polythene figure. This led to greater demand for plastic toy soldiers. The first American plastic soldiers were made by Beton as early as 1937. The first plastic toy soldiers produced in Great Britain were made in 1946 by Airfix before they became known for their famous model kits range.
One large historical producer in plastic was Louis Marx and Company, which produced both realistic soldiers of great detail and also historical collections of plastic men and women, including the &quot;Presidents of the United States&quot; collection, &quot;Warriors of the World&quot;, &quot;Generals of World War II&quot;, &quot;Jesus and the Apostles&quot;, and figures from the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Marx also produced boxed playsets that featured many famous battles with armies of two sides, character figures, and terrain features. Britains produced plastic figures under the brand names of Herald and Deetail. Also in England, the scale model company, Airfix produced a variety of high quality plastic sets, which were frequently painted by hobbyists. Many Airfix figures were imitated by other companies and reproduced as inexpensive, bagged plastic army men.

Timpo Toys, Britains main competitor in terms of sales and quality in the 1960s and 70s developed the &#x27;Over - Moulding&#x27; system. Different coloured plastics were injected into the mould at various stages, creating a fully coloured figure without the need of paint.

During the 1990s, the production of metal toy-grade painted figures and connoisseur-grade painted toy soldiers increased to serve the demands of the collectors&#x27; market. The style of many of these figures shifted from the traditional gloss-coat enamel paint to the matte-finished acrylic paint, which allows for greater detail and historical accuracy. The change was largely inspired by the introduction of very high quality painted figures from St. Petersburg, Russia.

==Collecting==
There is a substantial hobby devoted to collecting both old and new toy soldiers, with an abundance of small manufacturers, dealers, and toy soldier shows. There are even specialty magazines devoted to the hobby, such as &quot;Toy Soldier Collector&quot;, &quot;Plastic Warrior&quot; and &quot;Toy Soldier and Model Figure&quot;. Collectors often specialize in a particular type of soldier or historical period, though some people enjoy collecting many different kinds of figures. The most popular historical periods for collecting are Napoleonic, Victorian, American Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Many collectors modify and paint plastic figures, and some even cast and paint their own metal figures.

Actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr had a collection of 3000 toy soldiers when he sold it in 1977. Fantasy novelist George R. R. Martin has a substantial collection of toy knights and castles. The most extensive collection of toy soldiers was probably that of Malcolm Forbes, who began collecting toy soldiers in the late 1960s and amassed a collection of over 90,000 figures by the time of his death in 1990. Anne Seddon Kinsolving Brown of Providence, Rhode Island, US, began collecting miniature toy soldiers on her honeymoon to Europe in 1930, eventually amassing a collection of over 6,000 figures; these are on display at the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University Library in Providence.

Some of the more noteworthy, annual toy soldier and historical figure shows include the Plastic Warrior Show, which is the oldest established show in the UK. Beginning in 1985 and still being held annually in Richmond, South London. Another well known show is the London Toy Soldier Show held in central London (now owned and operated by the magazine Toy Soldier Collector), the Miniature Figure Collectors of America (MFCA) show in Valley Forge, the Chicago Toy Soldier Show (OTSN) in Illinois, the East Coast Toy Soldier Show in New Jersey, the West Coaster Toy Soldier Show in California, the Sammlerbörse (Collector&#x27;s Market) in Friedberg, Germany and the biennial Zinnfigurenbörse (Tin Figure Market) in Kulmbach, Germany.

In recent years, collectors of vintage toy soldiers made of polythene PE and polypropylene PP thermoplastics as well as PC/ABS plastic blends have reported brittling and disintegration of collectible miniatures or components thereof.

==Varieties==

Different types and styles of toy soldiers have been produced over the years, depending on the cost and availability of materials, as well as manufacturing technologies. Here is a list of some of the most commonly collected varieties of toy soldiers.
*Aluminum – slush-cast aluminium, made chiefly in France during the early and middle 20th century
*Army men – unpainted, soft plastic toy soldiers sold inexpensively in bags or with terrain pieces and vehicles in boxed playsets
*Composition – made from a mixture of sawdust and glue, manufactured mostly in Europe, Austria and Germany. Made in the US during WWII metal rationing.
*Connoisseur – high quality, collectible figures featuring highly detailed paint jobs
*Dimestore – hollow- or slush-cast iron, sold through five and dime stores from the 1920s to 1960 in the United States
*Flat – thin, two dimensional tin soldiers cast in slate molds
*Hollow cast – cast in metal, usually a lead alloy, which cools and sets as it touches the mold; the excess molten metal is poured out leaving a hollow figure
*Paper – printed on sheets of paper or cardboard, frequently mounted on blocks of wood
*Plastic – hard and soft plastic, generally painted figures
*Solid – cast in solid metal, usually lead, common in Germany during the 19th and early 20th century
*Wood - From the 19th century Germany produced large amounts of wooden fortresses and toy soldiers sometimes working on a scissors mechanism .

Prominent vintage toy soldier makers include Airfix, Barclay, Britains, Herald, Elastolin, Johillco, Lineol, Marx, Manoil, Reamsa and Timpo.

==Gaming==


The playing of wargames with toy figures was pioneered by H. G. Wells in his 1913 book, &quot;Little Wars&quot;. Wells, a pacifist, was the first to publish detailed rules for playing war games with toy soldiers. He suggested that this could provide a cathartic experience, possibly preventing future real wars. Although this was not to be, &quot;Little Wars&quot; was a predecessor to the modern hobby of miniatures wargaming. According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend Jerome K. Jerome. After dinner, Jerome began shooting down toy soldiers with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete.

A similar book titled &quot;Shambattle: How to Play with Toy Soldiers&quot; was published by Harry Dowdall and Joseph Gleason in 1929.

Although people continue to play wargames with miniature figures, most contemporary wargamers use a smaller scale than that favored by collectors, typically under 25 mm.

<text>The Australian Goldfields Open was a professional ranking snooker tournament. The final champion was John Higgins in 2015.

==History==
Australia had previously hosted the 1971 and 1975 World Snooker Championships, as well as several other high-profile snooker tournaments and in 1979 the &quot;Australian Masters&quot; was established. There was an attempt to turn the event into a ranking tournament in 1989 but the sponsorship fell through so it was staged in Hong Kong instead, as the &quot;Hong Kong Open&quot;, which incidentally became the first ranking tournament to be staged in Asia. The Hong Kong event was discontinued after just one year, but returned to Australia in 1994 as the &quot;Australian Open&quot;. The tournament reverted to being called the &quot;Australian Masters&quot; for the following season, but was dropped from the calendar after the 1995 event. In addition, the tournament was also held in 1995 as the &quot;Australian Open&quot; immediately following the Australian Masters, featuring mostly the same players and the same two players in the final. In 2011 the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association resurrected the event under the &quot;Australian Goldfields Open&quot; name and added it to the 2011/2012 calendar.
The tournament&#x27;s later incarnation providing the first ranking tournament victories for future World Champion Stuart Bingham and future world finalist Barry Hawkins and arguably resurrected the careers of these two players who had previously been considered journeyman professionals, who had previously hovered between the fringes of the top 16 and top 32.

In 2016, the event was quietly dropped from the calendar.

<doc id="669829" wikidata="Q1817704" url="?curid=669829" title="Seattle Thunderbirds">
<text>The Seattle Thunderbirds are a major junior ice hockey team based in the city of Kent, Washington. They are part of the U.S. Division of the Western Conference in the Western Hockey League. Founded in 1971 as the Vancouver Nats, the team arrived in Seattle in 1977 and played as the Breakers until 1985, when they adopted the Thunderbirds name. The team played in Seattle for three decades before moving to the accesso ShoWare Center in nearby Kent in 2008. The Thunderbirds are two-time WHL champions, with their most recent title coming in 2023.

==History==

=== Foundations ===
The team was founded in 1971 as the Vancouver Nats of the Western Canada Hockey League, but moved to Kamloops, British Columbia, after just two seasons to become the Kamloops Chiefs in 1973. In 1977, the team moved again, this time to Seattle, and was renamed the Seattle Breakers. The move came just years after the city narrowly missed out on securing a National Hockey League franchise. The Breakers began play in 1977–78, and played out of the Seattle Center Arena. Through eight seasons, the Breakers finished with a regular season record of 225 wins, 319 losses, and 32 ties; and playoff record of 11 wins and 21 losses, twice advancing as far as the West Division finals. The team nearly folded in 1982 when, under owner John Hamilton, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. This reality, combined with novel promotions like honoring unused Seattle Seahawks tickets at the gate, boosted attendance at Breakers games. This was also helped by on-ice success. Despite the off-ice challenges, the team, under coach Jack Sangster, swept the Victoria Cougars in the playoffs to advance to the Division finals. There, they faced the rival Portland Winter Hawks, dropping the series to the eventual champions 4 games to 2.

===The Thunderbirds===
After the 1984–85 season, the Breakers were sold to new owners and renamed the Seattle Thunderbirds as part of an extensive re-branding. Along with the new name, the team changed its color-scheme from orange, blue, and white, to green, blue, and white, announced a renovation plan for its home arena, and by 1990 began playing some of its games at the larger Seattle Center Coliseum. New management promised to spare no expense and to turn the team into a contender. This included hiring Russ Farwell as manager and Barry Melrose as coach—the two had been instrumental in the Medicine Hat Tigers&#x27; 1988 Memorial Cup championship. However, despite the scoring exploits of Glen Goodall—Goodall set new league records for goals (262) and points (573) and had his number 10 jersey retired when he turned professional in 1990—it would be twelve years before the Thunderbirds broke through to their first league final. Led by star forward Patrick Marleau, the Thunderbirds faced the Lethbridge Hurricanes in the 1997 championship series, which they lost in a sweep. Although the Thunderbirds would win their first and second regular season Division titles in 2002–03 and 2004–05, the eighteen seasons after their first finals appearance would see the team advance past the second round of the playoffs just once.

In 2006, the Thunderbirds announced their intention to move to a brand new arena being constructed in Kent, south of Seattle. The purpose-built arena was a major attraction for the team.

2015 marked the beginning of the most successful period in team history, as the Thunderbirds advanced to the finals four times in eight seasons, twice capturing the Ed Chynoweth Cup as league champions. Led by the likes of Matthew Barzal, Ethan Bear, and Keegan Kolesar, the 2015–16 season saw the Thunderbirds capture their first Division title since 2005 and make their deepest playoff run since 1997 when Matthew Wedman&#x27;s game four overtime goal sent the Thunderbirds past the Kelowna Rockets and into the championship final. They lost the final in five games to the Brandon Wheat Kings. The following season, the Thunderbirds returned to the final, where they faced the Regina Pats. They defeated the Pats in six games, with Alexander True scoring the title-winning goal in overtime of game six to secure Seattle&#x27;s first championship. With the win, Seattle advanced to the 2017 Memorial Cup tournament, where they were eliminated after three straight losses in the preliminary round.

After two straight first-round exits and two years without playoffs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Thunderbirds again emerged as a contender in the 2021–22 season. That season, the team returned to the finals and faced the Edmonton Oil Kings to contest the first league playoff title since 2019. Seattle lost the final in six games. The following season was the best in Thunderbirds&#x27; history with the team posting 54 wins and 111 points. In the playoffs, they eliminated the Memorial Cup-host Kamloops Blazers in the Western Conference championship, moving on to face the Winnipeg Ice in the title series. They defeated the Ice in five games to earn a berth in the 2023 Memorial Cup tournament. There, led by Dylan Guenther and goaltender Thomas Milic, the Thunderbirds advanced to the tournament final, which they lost to the Quebec Remparts.

=== Rivals ===
The Thunderbirds are one of five teams based in Washington, along with the Tri-City Americans, Spokane Chiefs, Wenatchee Wild, and Everett Silvertips. The Thunderbirds have built an enduring rivalry with the Portland Winterhawks, dating back to the 1980s. Everett is the closest team to Seattle and a natural rival; and the two teams have met regularly in the playoffs, including a three-year stretch between 2016 and 2018 where the winner of the series between the two made it all the way to the championship series.

<doc id="669831" wikidata="Q1540658" url="?curid=669831" title="Microvascular angina">
<text>Microvascular angina (MVA), previously known as cardiac syndrome X, also known as coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) or microvascular coronary disease is a type of angina (chest pain) with signs associated with decreased blood flow to heart tissue but with normal coronary arteries.

The use of the term cardiac syndrome X (CSX) can lead to the lack of appreciation of how microvascular angina is a debilitating heart related pain condition with the increased risk of heart attack and other heart problems. Women may have difficulty accessing the specialist care of a cardiologist for this reason.

Some studies have found an increased risk of other vasospastic disorders in cardiac microvascular angina patients, such as migraine and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. Treatment typically involves beta-blockers, such as metoprolol, however beta blockers can make coronary spasms worse.

Microvascular angina is a separate condition from variant angina.

==Signs and symptoms==

Patients often experience myocardial ischemia symptoms, such as heaviness, tightness, pressure or squeezing in the chest area, which can also include sweating, nausea, shortness of breath (dyspnea), fatigue.

While there is no formal definition of microvascular angina, the general consensus is that it entails all of the following:
* Angina: This usually does not cause dysfunction on echocardiogram and can last longer than that of heart disease.
* Abnormal cardiac stress test: ST segment changes in EKG are typically similar to those of coronary artery disease, and the opposite of those of Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina. Myocardial perfusion imaging can be abnormal in 30% of patients.
* Coronary angiogram: Normal
* Other causes of chest pain must be ruled out, including:
** Variant angina / Coronary artery spasm.
** Esophageal spasm

==Causes==

There is no specific known cause for microvascular angina but rather a multitude of risk factors that act together. It is believed that the lack of blood flow caused by a microvascular disease and enhanced pain perception are two of the factors that may cause it. The microvascular dysfunctions refer to the abnormalities in the very small blood vessels of the heart. The narrowing of these vessels may lead to lack of oxygen in specific areas of the cardiac muscle causing chest pain. Several studies have shown that patients living with microvascular angina may have an enhanced pain perception, and usually feel more intense chest pain than individuals without microvascular angina.

The risk factors include abdominal obesity, meaning excessive visceral fat tissue in and around the abdomen, atherogenic dyslipidemia which is a blood fat disorder, and elevated blood pressure. Other risk factors are insulin resistance or intolerance to glucose, prothrombotic state or proinflammatory state. Older people are more at risk to develop this condition, and there is some evidence that suggests that there are genetic mutations that predispose to the syndrome. Women are more prone to this condition than men, as well as those who have a history of heart disease in the family. 

==Pathophysiology==

This condition is typically characterized by a series of structural and functional changes within the heart&#x27;s microcirculation, such as endothelial dysfunction (which affects the inner lining of blood vessels), microvascular arteriolar remodeling (changes in the vessel structure) such as intimal thickening, smooth muscle cell proliferation, perivascular fibrosis, and increased microvascular resistance (which impedes blood flow). There are also differences in coronary blood flow reserve (the capacity to increase blood flow during increased demand) and IMR (index of microcirculatory resistance).

In a large percentage of patients, there is a finding of systemic microvascular abnormalities, causing reduced blood flow in the microvasculature of the cardiac muscles. When the blood vessels constrict and fail to dilate there is decreased oxygen levels to the cardiac muscles resulting in hypoxia which lead to chest pain.

While numerous physiological mechanisms have been proposed, none have been proven.

== Types of microvascular dysfunction ==

=== Structural endotype ===
Patients with the structural coronary microvascular dysfunction endotype (&quot;inability to dilate)&quot; tend to have a high vascular tone at rest and high vascular tone at stress. Patients with this endotype typically show normal CBF (coronary blood flow) at rest, lower stress CBF, lower coronary flow reserve (CFR) and elevated hyperemic index of microcirculatory resistance (hMR). Their microvascular resistance and endothelial dysfunction is elevated.

It is characterized by luminal obstruction, vascular-wall infiltration, vascular remodeling, perivascular fibrosis and capillary rarefaction.

In this type individuals may have impaired vasodilatory capacity and endothelial function, leading to reduced coronary blood flow and compromised myocardial perfusion, especially during stress or increased demand.

=== Functional endotype ===
Functional coronary microvascular dysfunction endotype (&quot;exhausted dilatory capacity&quot;) presents a low vascular tone at rest and low vascular tone at stress. Individuals often display elevated rest CBF, normal stress CBF, lower CFR and normal hMR, normal microvascular resistance and higher nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. It is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, smooth-muscle dysfunction and autonomic dysfunction. Endothelial function and vasodilatory capacity is relatively preserved resulting in adequate myocardial perfusion under resting conditions.

==Diagnosis==
Microvascular angina is a diagnosis of exclusion. Typically this will necessitate both a clinical diagnosis, appropriate stress testing, and a coronary angiogram that meet the above criteria. Cardiac MRI can be used to diagnose microvascular angina. Studies are ongoing to validate this approach.

There is growing evidence that microvascular angina is caused by a functional disorder of the microvessels, coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). Blood vessels either fail to dilate or constrict in response to various stressors such as exercise, the cold or emotional stress.

An angiogram with acetylcholine can demonstrate microvascular dysfunction which can affect the microvessels and larger coronary arteries leading to either microvascular angina or coronary artery spasms (Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina). These are considered discrete conditions though some individuals can be affected by both.

Microvascular angina can be diagnosed using different tests and exams, but it is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion. However, sedentary and overweight individuals with a family history of type 2 diabetes should be tested regularly to determine whether they have irregular levels of glucose or lipids, or blood pressure abnormalities, factors which are usually associated with microvascular angina. A first test to be taken is an exercise stress test which shows if the heart is not getting blood during exertion. 

Angiograms may be useful and conclusive when microvascular angina they offer a detailed image of the heart. However, they cannot detect potential abnormalities in the small arteries, and the doctor may ask for more tests in order to rule out other heart conditions, such as Prinzmetal&#x27;s angina (variant/vasospastic angina, coronary artery spasm) which has similar symptoms.

===Differential diagnosis===
Chest pain caused by microvascular angina is most of the time unpredictable and it can occur when at rest and/or during exercise. The pain associated with microvascular angina is normally more intense and it lasts for longer periods of time compared to pain caused by other conditions. 

Many gastric conditions can cause chest pains (sub-sternal pain), while this is usually associated with consumption of food this is not always the case, and is a very common differential diagnosis.

For example, a stable angina causes chest pain that goes away when at rest. Another difference is that while chest pain caused by any type of stable angina is relieved with nitroglycerin, this drug is not effective in most patients with microvascular angina.

==Treatment==

*Calcium channel blockers - specifically nifedipine and diltiazem can be effective.
*Beta blockers - also work. Can make coronary spasms worse.
*Aminophylline - may work by inhibiting adenosine receptors.
*Estrogen - may work in women.
*L-Arginine - increases release of NO at vascular level, thus leading to vasodilatory effect.
*Ranolazine - shown to improve angina and myocardial ischemia.
*Statins
*Aspirin
*Clopidogrel
*ACE inhibitors and ARBs
*Lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise.
*Pain management through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mindfulness meditation, yoga and Tai Chi.

Microvascular angina is a chronic long term condition which increases the risk of heart attack and other cardiac events such as heart failure and frequent hospital admissions. The treatment consists of drugs, mainly to relieve chest pain, but a very important part of the treatment is regularly visiting the doctor and repeating the tests to make sure the condition was taken care of in full.

The first step in managing Microvascular angina is the administration of nitrates which may relieve the chest pain. They are used because of their ability to relax the muscles of the heart and blood vessels. However, they prove to be inefficient in as many as half of patients. 
Alternative treatments may consist of calcium channel blockers or beta blockers which reduce chest pain by relaxing the muscle cells lining the artery and improving blood flow to the heart while lowering blood pressure. Aminophylline may also work, while estrogen can be effective in women.

There is at present no known cure however a change in lifestyle is important. Patients should start following healthier diets which are low in saturated fats, and should participate in regular physical activities. However, any patient with a heart disease condition should first seek for a medical opinion before starting exercising. Quitting smoking is also highly recommended.

==Incidence==
The reasons why women are more prone than men to develop a Microvascular angina are still not clear. However, it is believed that hormones along with other risk factors unique to women play a very important role. The constant changing of the estrogen levels may be one of the reasons along with the changes brought by birth.

== History ==
Microvascular angina was first described by H. G. Kemp in 1973 as angina-like chest pain in the absence of angiographic evidence of coronary obstruction.

<text>The Truce or Treaty of Yam-Zapolsky (Ям-Запольский) or Jam Zapolski, signed on 15 January 1582 between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Tsardom of Russia, was one of the treaties that ended the Livonian War. It followed the successful Livonian campaign of Stephen Báthory, culminating in the siege of Pskov.

The truce was concluded with help of papal legate Antonio Possevino and was signed for the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan Batory and for Russia by Tsar Ivan the Terrible, and established a ten-year truce.

In the terms of the treaty, Russia renounced its claims to Livonia and Polotsk but conceded no core Russian territories as Batory returned the territories his armies had been occupying (particularly, he gave up on the siege of Pskov and left the town of Velikiye Luki. The truce was extended for twenty years in 1600, when a diplomatic mission to Moscow led by Lew Sapieha concluded negotiations with Tsar Boris Godunov. The truce was broken when the Poles invaded Russia in 1605.

One of the principal negotiators on the Polish side was Krzysztof Warszewicki.

<text>:&quot;The volcano system in Iceland that started activity on August 17, 2014, and ended on February 27, 2015, is Bárðarbunga.&quot;
:&quot;The volcano in Iceland that erupted in May 2011 is Grímsvötn.&quot;


Iceland experiences frequent volcanic activity, due to its location both on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a divergent tectonic plate boundary, and being over a hotspot. Nearly thirty volcanoes are known to have erupted in the Holocene epoch; these include Eldgjá, source of the largest lava eruption in human history. Some of the various eruptions of lava, gas and ash have been both destructive of property and deadly to life over the years, as well as disruptive to local and European air travel.

==Volcanic systems and volcanic zones of Iceland==
Holocene volcanism in Iceland is mostly to be found in the &quot;Neovolcanic Zone&quot;, comprising the Reykjanes volcanic belt (RVB), the West volcanic zone (WVZ), the Mid-Iceland belt (MIB), the East volcanic zone (EVZ) and the North volcanic zone (NVZ). Two lateral volcanic zones play a minor role: Öræfi volcanic belt (ÖVB also known as Öræfajökull volcanic system) and Snæfellsnes volcanic belt (SVB). Outside of the main island are the Reykjanes Ridge (RR), as part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the south-west and the Kolbeinsey Ridge (KR) to the north. Two transform zones are connecting these volcano-tectonic zones: the South Iceland seismic zone (SISZ) in the south of Iceland and the Tjörnes transform zone (TFZ) in the north.

The island has around 30 active volcanic systems. Within each are volcano-tectonic fissure systems and many, but not all of them, also have at least one central volcano (mostly in the form of a stratovolcano, sometimes of a shield volcano with a magma chamber underneath). Several classifications of the systems exist, for example there is one of 30 systems, and one of 34 systems, with the later currently being used in Iceland itself. There are 23 central volcanoes using the definition that they: erupt frequently; extrude either basaltic, intermediate or felsic lavas; have an associated shallow crustal magma chamber, and are often associated with collapse caldera or fissure systems. Shield volcanoes, as the term is used in the Iceland context, tend to erupt only once, so have monogenetic characteristics. However many shield volcanoes outside Iceland are associated with oceanic island volcanism such as in Hawaii where they have been built up over many eruptions. Fissure vents in Iceland tend to produce calmer effusive eruptions, but can be associated with large volumes of lava (flood basalt events) and some have had prolonged eruptions with numerous eruptive episodes, lasting for years.

Up to 2008, thirteen of the volcanic systems had hosted eruptions since the settlement of Iceland in AD 874. Nearly thirty volcanoes are known to have erupted in the Holocene epoch and so are active.

Of these active volcanic systems, the most active is Grímsvötn. Over the past 500 years, Iceland&#x27;s volcanoes have produced a third of the total global lava output. Current productivity, which is known to be cyclical, has been estimated to be between per year which is higher than the output rate of the Hawaiian volcanoes, and would be double or even triple this figure if intrusive volumes are included.

===Volcano tectonics===
The types of eruptions most likely in a particular Icelandic volcanic system or zone are now understood. Earthquakes and volcanism have patterns in time and place that can be combined into a consistent tectonic process that is explained by the geological deformation of Iceland. In summary in Iceland there are four main types of tectonic zones:
#Spreading zones of rifting and volcanism producing the predominant Iceland tholeiitic basaltic crust
#Fracture zones connecting offset branches of the spreading zones which includes the SISZ
#Trans-tensional zones with transform faulting and spreading of which are the RVB and TFZ
#Flank zones with stratovolcanoes and minor rifting with alkalic to transitional volcanic rocks over the crust
These tectonic zones result from the interaction of combination of the spreading activity of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is spreading in a general east and west direction while the mantle plume activity that results in the hotspot, has been migrating over at least the last 25 million years in a west to slightly south-east direction.

== Geology ==

===Morphology ===
Fissure vents are found predominantly in what are termed fissure swarms (a combination of tectonic related fissures and faults) that are also associated with crater rows and smaller cinder or spatter cones. Where such eruptions interact with water the eruptions become more explosive and these phreatomagmatic eruptions produce tephra and possibly maars and tuff rings or cones.

=== Composition ===
The composition of the lava reflects the tectonic factors above and are consistent with the influence of the hotspot so the trend is for ocean island basalts (OIB) type to predominate over mid ocean ridge basalts (MORB) which are only found in the north of the NVZ. The compositional series are thus tholeiitic basalt, transitional alkalic basalts and alkalic (felsic).

Large extrusive, predominantly tholeiitic basaltic lava fields and shields with theoleiitic lava are the predominant material erupted and are found in the RVB, WVZ, MIB, EVZ and NVZ. They are associated with divergence tectonics of the ridge plate boundaries. Central volcanoes, with associated fissure swarms are typical, except in the RVB. Hengill is the only active central volcano in the far east of the RVB, and this is likely to be because here a triple junction exists, resulting in a volcano with some rhyolytic and dacite components due to the complexity of its rift propagation formation. The island of Eldey off the south-west of the RVB has similar geological formations to the RVB but has a basalt composition with tholeiites and picrites. Hofsjökull, a large volcano with a caldera and rhyolite lavas in the MIB has explosive eruption potential but has not erupted underneath its ice cover for several thousand years and its companion Kerlingarfjöll for even longer.

Arc volcanism has been thought to be occurring in the Snæfellsnes volcanic belt with alkaline magma series volcanism in the stratovolcanoes such as Snæfellsjökull which usually erupt effusive basaltic lava but can have infrequent explosive silicic eruptions followed by extrusion of intermediate composition lava. However the modelling of the processes involved is incomplete and almost certainly involves primarily fractional crystallization of primary basaltic magma with limited input from pre-existing crustal material as is the case in arc volcanism. The ÖVB is represented by the Öræfajökull (Hnappafellsjökull) stratovolcano which has a history of violent rhyolite to alkali basalt eruptions with tephra volumes up to and accompanying jökulhlaup.

The island Vestmannaeyjar volcano to the south east of Iceland has in its recent activity formed the island of Surtsey and cones such as Eldfell on Heimaey. It is the southern tip of the EVZ propagating rift in what is an off rift region called the South Iceland Volcanic Zone (SIVZ), and the older alkaline basalts were alkali olivine and more recent mugearite in composition. The basalts of the southern EVZ on land are rarely silicic but the volcanoes can have explosive phreatomagmatic eruptions.

Overall the surface area of post glacial erupted rocks of Iceland is 92% basalt, 4% basaltic andesites, 1% andesites, and 3% dacite-rhyolites.

==Important eruptions==
&quot;See also : List of volcanic eruptions in Iceland&quot;

===Largest Holocene eruptions ===
Due to incomplete surveys, which also need to be confined to subaerial eruptions and not include igneous intrusions, the accumulative amounts of dense-rock equivalent erupted in Iceland will be underestimated. The amounts known are some of the most significant contributions to recent eruptive volumes on Earth. Since the last ice age 91% of the magma erupted in Iceland has been mafic, 6% intermediate in composition and 3% silicic. The number of eruptions estimated in this 11,700 odd year period can only be an approxiamate figure, but about three to four explosive ones occur for every purely effusive one.


===Hekla===
Hekla has erupted more than 20 times in recorded history. It was known to medieval Europeans as the Gate of Hell; that reputation persisted into the 19th century.

===Laki/Skaftáreldar 1783–1784===
The most deadly volcanic eruption of Iceland&#x27;s history was the so-called Skaftáreldar (fires of Skaftá) in 1783–1784. The eruption was in the crater row &quot;Lakagígar&quot; (craters of Laki) southwest of Vatnajökull glacier. The craters are a part of a larger volcanic system with the subglacial Grímsvötn as a central volcano. Roughly a fifth of the Icelandic population died because of the eruption. Most died not because of the lava flow or other direct effects of the eruption but from indirect effects, including changes in climate and illnesses in livestock in the following years caused by the ash and poisonous gases from the eruption. The eruption resulted in the second largest basaltic lava flow from a single eruption in
historic times.

===Eldfell 1973===
Eldfell is a volcanic cone on the east side of the island of Heimaey which formed during an eruption in January 1973. The eruption happened without warning, causing the island&#x27;s population of about 5,300 people to evacuate on fishing boats within a few hours. Importantly, the progress of lava into the harbour was slowed by manual spraying of seawater. One person died, and the eruption resulted in the destruction of homes and property on the island.

===Eyjafjallajökull 2010===

The eruption under Eyjafjallajökull in April 2010 caused extreme disruption to air travel across western and northern Europe over a period of six days in April 2010. About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial jet traffic and it affected approximately 10 million travellers.

The eruption had a VEI of 4, the largest known from Eyjafjallajökull. Several previous eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull have been followed soon afterwards by eruptions of the larger volcano Katla, but after the 2010 eruption, no activity occurred at Katla.

===Grímsvötn 2011===

The eruption in May 2011 at Grímsvötn under the Vatnajökull glacier sent thousands of tonnes of ash into the sky in a few days, raising concerns of the potential for travel chaos across northern Europe although only about 900 flights were initially disrupted.

===Holuhraun 2014–2015===

Bárðarbunga is a stratovolcano and is roughly above sea level in central Iceland, i.e. in the northern edge of Vatnajökull. This makes it the second highest mountain in Iceland.

Hóluhraun is an older lavafield situated north-east of Bárðarbunga, south of Askja (last eruption 1961), at an altitude of about . Here the eruption started on August 17, 2014, and lasted for 180 days. The 2014–2015 eruption was Iceland&#x27;s largest in 230 years. Following a major earthquake swarm, multiple lava fountain eruptions began in Holuhraun. The lava flow rate was between and came from a dyke over long. An ice-filled subsidence bowl over in area and up to deep formed as well. There was very limited ash output from this eruption. The primary concern with this eruption was the large plumes of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere which adversely affected breathing conditions across Iceland, depending on wind direction. The volcanic cloud was also transported toward Western Europe in September 2014.

===Fagradalsfjall 2021–2022===

Following a three-week period of increased seismic activity, an eruption fissure developed near Fagradalsfjall, a mountain on the Reykjanes Peninsula. Lava flow from a 200-meter fissure was first discovered by an Icelandic Coast Guard helicopter on March 19, 2021, in the Geldingadalur area near Grindavík, and within hours the fissure had grown to in length.

Another eruption, very similar to the 2021 eruption, began on 3 August 2022, and ceased on 21 August 2022.

===Litli-Hrútur 2023===
On 10 July 2023 at 16:40 UTC, a fissure eruption began adjacent to the summit of Litli-Hrútur.

===Sundhnúkur 2023–2024===

On December 18, 2023, at 22:17 near Hagafell, the volcano began a fissure eruption. In January, 2024 lava from this eruption destroyed 3 houses in the nearby town of Grindavík.

==Structure of lava fields==

The smooth flowing basaltic lava pāhoehoe is known in Icelandic as &quot;helluhraun&quot; . It forms smooth surfaces that are quite easy to cross. More viscous lava forms ʻaʻā flows, known in Icelandic as &quot;apalhraun&quot; . The loose, broken, sharp, spiny surface of an ʻaʻā flow makes hiking across it difficult, slow and dangerous, it is easy to stick a foot into a hole and break a leg.

<doc id="669850" wikidata="Q6887795" url="?curid=669850" title="Mock trial">
<text>A mock trial is an act or imitation trial. It is similar to a moot court, but mock trials simulate lower-court trials, while moot court simulates appellate court hearings. Attorneys preparing for a real trial might use a mock trial consisting of volunteers as role players to test theories or experiment with each other. Mock trial is also the name of an extracurricular program in which students participate in rehearsed trials to learn about the legal system in a competitive manner. Interscholastic mock trials take place on all levels including primary school, middle school, high school, college, and law school. Mock trial is often taught in conjunction with a course in trial advocacy or takes place as an after school enrichment activity. Some gifted and talented programs may also take place in one.

==Litigation related mock trials==
Litigators may use mock trials to assist with trial preparation and settlement negotiations of actual cases. Unlike school-related mock trials, these mock trials can take numerous forms depending on the information sought. For example, when faced with complex fact issues in a particular case, attorneys might convene a mini mock trial to try different methods of presenting their evidence, sometimes before a jury.

==Competitive school-related mock trials around the world==

===Asia Pacific===
Guam has been hosting the annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition. In 2011 and 2012, there were 14 teams from Guam, South Korea, and Saipan in its 4th annual competition. The competition was held at the Superior Court of Guam. The teams made up of mostly junior and senior students from high schools. The Champion of the 4th Annual Asia-Pacific Invitational Mock Trial Competition was Marianas Baptist Academy of Saipan.

===Australia===
Mock trial competitions in Australia are held regionally. These include:
* The Law Society of South Australia Mock Trial Competition comprises a series of simulated court cases by students years 10, 11 and 12 from 32 schools in South Australia.
* The Law Society of Western Australia Interschool Mock Trial Competition is held each year for students enrolled in years 10, 11 and 12 in Western Australia. There were 773 students representing 68 teams from 38 schools participated in 2011.
* The Capital Region Mock Trial Competition is organized by University of Canberra. There were teams of schools in Australian Capital Territory region with year 10, 11 and 12 students.
* The New South Wales Mock Trial Competition has been running since 1981 for students years 10 and 11 in New South Wales initially with 28 schools. There have also been international events with mock trial competitions between Australia and the United Kingdom. In 2008, schools from this region also traveled to New York City to compete in the Empire Mock Trial Competition. The first Asia-Australia mock trial competition via video conference between Australian teams and a Korean team was held in 2009.

===Continental Europe===
Mock trials in continental Europe are less coordinated than their UK or US counterparts, but there are a few isolated examples. In Germany, the Faculty of Legal Sciences of the University of Regensburg organizes the REGINA Mock Trial. The University of Erlangen-Nuremberg organizes a mock trial specialized in administrative law. In Spain, there is a mock trial program specialized in insurance law coordinated by the Fundacion INADE-UDC Chair of Risk Management and Insurance.

===United Kingdom===
The National Bar Mock Trial Competition involves students taking on the roles of barristers and witnesses and presenting their case against teams from other schools. Young Citizens, in association with His Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunal Service and the Bar Council, has been running Mock Trial Competitions annually since 1991. The competition consists of several regional heats and a national final to decide the winner. In 2022/23, 938 students aged between 15 – 18 years old from 144 schools participated in the competition. The heats were supported by over 70 legal volunteers, including judges, barristers and law students.

The Magistrates Mock Trial Competition, organised by Young Citizens in association with the Magistrates Association, involves students taking on the roles of magistrates and witnesses. In 2022/2023, approximately 2,900 students aged between 12 – 14 years from 193 schools participated in the competition. The heats were supported by approximately 600 legal volunteers, including judges, barristers and law students.

Mock Trials are primarily aimed at promoting confidence in public speaking as well as introducing young people to the justice system and legal profession.

In Scotland, The School Mock Court Case Project runs both primary and secondary school competitions, although has undertaken a number of international competitions. Currently some 100 schools, circa 3,000 students are involved. As of 2021, international schools started entering the programme, with over 16 countries taking part.

====Competition framework====
Competitive mock trial functions in yearly cycles. Each year, a case packet is distributed to all participating schools in late summer to early fall. The case packet is a series of documents including the charges, penal code, stipulations, case law, and jury instructions as well as all exhibits and affidavits relevant to the case. During a mock trial, competitors are restricted to only the materials provided in the case packet and may not reference any outside sources. In order to prepare for competition, teams thoroughly read and analyze the case packet.

National mock trial teams consist of a minimum of six and a maximum of twelve official members. The size of state mock trial teams can vary; California, for example, allows up to 25 official team members. Each team prepares both sides of the case: prosecution and defense in a criminal trial, plaintiff and defense in a civil action. Each side is composed of two or three attorneys as well as two or three witnesses, all played by members of the team. Teams must be organized into two sides of five to six players for the prosecution/plaintiff and defense. It is important to note that high school mock trial is governed by state bar associations, meaning that cases, rules, and competition structure vary from state to state whereas all of college mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association, meaning that every school uses the same case and is subject to the same rules.

====Procedure====
The mock trial begins with the judge entering the courtroom. The judge then gives out the instructions to the jury (about what they are to listen to). Then if there is a pretrial motion, the defense and prosecution give their respective pretrial arguments. The judge then lets the prosecution or plaintiff give an opening statement. Following the prosecution/plaintiff&#x27;s opening statement, the judge may offer the defense to deliver the opening statement during that time as well, or to wait until after the prosecution has presented all of its witnesses. After the opening statements, examination of the witnesses begins. The prosecution/plaintiff calls their witnesses first. Witnesses are sworn in by their team&#x27;s bailiff/timekeeper. A student competitor attorney for the prosecution/plaintiff does a direct examination of the witness. Once the direct examination is complete, the opposing team may cross-examine the witness. After the cross-examination, if the first team chooses, they may re-direct the witness. Likewise, the other team may do a re-cross after a re-direct. However, re-direct and re-cross examinations are only limited to the scope of the previous examination conducted by opposing counsel. This process is repeated for the two remaining plaintiff witnesses. Once the prosecution/plaintiff have finished with their witnesses, the defense may give their opening statement if not delivered before, and then the process is repeated with the defense witnesses, having the defense attorneys direct and the plaintiff attorneys cross-examine.

Once all of the witnesses have been examined, the trial moves to closing arguments. The prosecutor/plaintiff again goes first and has the option to reserve time beforehand for rebuttal. After the defense finishes their closing argument, the plaintiff may give their rebuttal argument if they still have time remaining. In some competitions, the rebuttal is limited to the scope of the defense&#x27;s closing argument. Time limits are set at each level of competition to prevent the trials from running too long and to keep rounds of competition running smoothly. Time limits are as follows:
Time limits may vary from state-to-state competitions. Please note that time is kept track of by the bailiff/timekeeper, who times their co-counsel&#x27;s statements, examinations, and arguments. Time is stopped for objections.

==== Objections ====
A main part of mock trial is the raising and arguing of objections given by opposing teams. Objections are raised when the opposing counsel attempts to bring in evidence or testimony that go against the rules of evidence. When an objection is raised, the judge may either overrule or sustain it immediately, or ask opposing counsel for their argument about why the testimony/evidence is admissible. Time is paused for objections, so an objection &quot;battle&quot; could theoretically go on for hours at a time until the judge makes a ruling. There is often an over all time limit given to rounds of competition, called &quot;all loss&quot; that prevent this from occurring. Mock trial students receive an abridged version of rules of evidence to base their objections on in the case packet that contains the witness affidavits and other elements of the court case.

====Judging====
There are several different ways that a mock trial can be judged. In one, the judges for scoring the mock trial consist of the presiding judge and two scoring judges, all of whom score the teams. In a second method, there are two scoring judges and the presiding judge, as in the first method, but the presiding judge does not score the teams, rather the judge simply votes or casts a ballot for one team or another. In yet another method of judging, there are three scoring judges and the presiding judge is not involved in the scoring of the teams. Often at college invitationals, there are two scoring judges, one of whom doubles as the presiding judge. Since enticing attorneys to judge is notoriously difficult (as judges are rarely compensated with more than a free lunch), it is rare to see more than two judges in a round at most competitions.

Unlike real law, the victorious team does not necessarily have to win on the merits of the case. Instead, evaluators score individual attorneys and witnesses on a 1–10 scale (though some states use different scales for high school competitions) based on each stage of the trial. These consist of the opening statements for the plaintiff and defense, each of the witnesses’ testimony, direct and cross-examination by attorneys, and the closing statements for both sides. The team with the highest total number of points is often, but not always, the team that wins the judge&#x27;s verdict. Given this method of scoring, it is possible for the defendant to be found guilty or lose the case but for the defense team to still win the round.

In some competitions, points can be deducted from a team&#x27;s score for testifying with information outside the scope of the mock trial materials and for unsportsmanlike conduct or abuse of objections. However, scores are completely at a judge&#x27;s discretion, meaning that scores are subjective based on different evaluation criteria.

====Power matching====
In the first round of the tournament, all of the teams are randomly matched to compete with each other. After the first round of some tournaments, teams are “power matched” to go up against other teams with similar records (e.g. in the second round, a 1–0 team will be matched with another 1–0 team). If there is a tie in record, the judges will use the number of ballots and total points earned to decide the matching. This allows for teams to compete with other teams of similar skill.

Of course, there are practical exceptions to the theory of power matching. Tab room coordinators who are creating brackets for each round may deviate from the rules of power matching in order to 1. allow each team to alternate between prosecution/plaintiff and defense between rounds, 2. avoid two teams from the same school competing against each other (Maryland Rule), 3. avoid having a team compete against a team it played in a prior round.

=====National championship format=====
In the national championship format, which is also employed by invitationals across the country, the tournament is power matched through the last round. While this determines the strongest team at the tournament overall, it does not provide an accurate representation of 2nd, 3rd, 4th place teams, etc., because they might have lost multiple ballots to a strong team who placed first.

=====Power protection=====
When tournaments are power protected, it means that the first rounds of competition are power matched as stated above. In the last round(s), however, the team with the strongest record is paired against the team with the weakest record. This ensures that the best teams do not knock each other out of the running for a rank. Rather, it&#x27;s anticipated that the stronger team will win and protect their chance at a rank, while there is no harm done to the weaker team who is already out of reach of a trophy. Additionally, this method gives weaker teams exposure to stronger programs that they can learn from.

====Levels of competition====

=====Elementary school=====
At the elementary school level, the mock trial guide by American Bar Association suggests to use role-playing from scripted mock trials such as fairy tale mock trials as a way to introduce the concept of conflicts, trials, jury verdicts in civil trials, vocabulary of the court, damages, and the roles of individuals portrayed in the trial. Therefore, most of mock trials at this level are non-competitive classroom activities. There is no national competition for this level. However, a few states offer intrastate competitions. There are a couple of different formats for competitions at this level.

The first format focuses on how the cases are developed such as &quot;New Jersey Law Fair&quot; competitions. Students grades 3 to 6 are asked to generate, develop and write the case from their own idea to include details of the facts, issue, witnesses, statements, instructions, sub-issues, concepts and law. As the students at this age range may not know the details of applicable law, students are allowed to create their own law. There are no specific themes, students can choose any age-appropriate topics. The students are encouraged to do a role-playing in a mock trial based on the script that they have developed to involve other students in the classroom as juries in order to refine their case. Each team plays the roles of both side in their case during the mock trial. The winners will perform their case in the real court.

In North Carolina, the competition has a different format which focuses more on presentation skills. All teams are given the same case which has been written prior to the competition and students are asked to perform role-playing on the case. &quot;North Carolina Elementary School Mock Trial Competition&quot; uses the winning entries from New Jersey Law Fair in the prior year as the cases for students to perform.

Another format is to follow the standard format similar to the high school level but with less technical restriction. All teams are given the same material related to a case and prepare for the competition. Two teams compete in a live mock trial to represent two sides of the case. This format is used in the &quot;New Hampshire Bar Association&#x27;s Mock Trial Competition&quot;. However, the first round of the competition is done by video submission where each team performs in both sides of the case. The qualified teams will be invited to the live competition with each team on each side of the case.

=====Middle school=====
Although there is no national competition for middle/junior high school level, there are many intrastate competitions held by state/county level organizers:

:* With the exception of New Jersey, all competitions have similar format as in high school competitions with some rules relaxed. In New Jersey, the format is similar to the &quot;New Jersey Law Fair&quot; at the elementary school level with two specific themes that the teams can choose to develop their cases.

=====High school=====
The mock trial program was started to allow high school students to experience a courtroom setting in a variety of hands-on roles. The mock trials are set up and structured just like a real court and are bound by the same rules. This can help the students to know exactly what role each of the different people in a court (judges, lawyers, witnesses, etc.) do in the judicial system. High school competitions are even held in functional courtrooms in the local City Hall to lend additional authenticity to the trial, are presided over by real judges, and the competing teams are typically coached and scored by practicing attorneys. Cases typically have to do with problems faced by teens, and includes competitors as witnesses. Each year the case for pre-Nationals competitions alternates between a Civil case and a Criminal case. The cases are set up in such a way that the witnesses, defendant, and prosecution (or plaintiff, for a Civil case) are all given gender neutral names to prevent gender based arguments from being brought up in the final arguments.
The National High School Mock Trial Championship began in 1984. This first competition consisted of teams from Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. The competition since has grown and now is considered to be an All-State tournament. Each year, various participating states around the country take turns hosting the tournament. There are only three teams in the tournament&#x27;s history that have won the competition consecutive times: Family Christian Academy Homeschoolers from Tennessee (now CSTHEA) in the years 2002–2003, Jonesboro High School from Georgia in the years 2007–2008, and Albuquerque Academy from New Mexico in the years 2012–2013. The Championship rotates around through the membership organizations and has been held in Phoenix, Arizona, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Indianapolis, Indiana, Madison, Wisconsin, Raleigh, North Carolina, Boise, Idaho, Hartford, Connecticut, Reno, Nevada, Athens, Georgia, and Wilmington, Delaware. New York State does not participate in the national competition; rather, it has its own intrastate competition consisting of over 350 teams throughout the state. It follows similar rules to that of the national competition. New York has three levels of play, county competition, regional competition, and the finals, which is held in Albany, New York in May. Before 2021, the state of Maryland did not compete in the National High School Mock Trial Championship, and had their own statewide mock trial competition similar to that of New York; it did compete in the national competition for the first time in 2021, and was crowned champion. New Jersey and North Carolina both pulled out of the NHSMTC competition following the 2005 season due to a refusal by the organization to accommodate an Orthodox Jewish team, Torah Academy of Bergen County, that had won New Jersey&#x27;s state championship. Both states rejoined in 2010 after their concerns regarding accommodation had been addressed.

Each state has its own case every year that is different from the national case. This means that the winners of each state competition, who move on to nationals, must study and prepare a completely different case in time for the National High School Mock Trial Championship in May. The national competition is governed by National Mock Trial Championship, Inc.

=====College=====
Inter-collegiate mock trial is governed by the American Mock Trial Association or AMTA. This organization was founded in 1985 by Richard Calkins, the dean of the Drake University Law School. AMTA sponsors regional and national-level competitions, writes and distributes case packets and rules, and keeps a registry of mock trial competitors and alumni. The case packet is generally written and distributed prior to the scholastic year in August, and case changes are made throughout the season, usually in September, December, and finally in February after Regional competitions and prior to the Opening Round of Championships. Since 2015, AMTA has released a new case to be used for the National Championship following the completion of the Opening Round of Championships. Approximately 700 teams from over 400 universities and colleges will compete in AMTA tournaments. In total, AMTA provides a forum for over 7,300 undergraduate students each academic year to engage in intercollegiate mock trial competitions across the country.

On the inter-collegiate circuit, a mock trial team consists of three attorneys and three witnesses on each side of the case (plaintiff/prosecution and defense). The attorneys are responsible for delivering an opening statement, conducting direct and cross examinations of witnesses and delivering closing arguments. Witnesses are selected in a sports draft format from a pool of approximately eight to 10 available witnesses prior to the round. Typical draft orders are DPDPDP, PPPDDD, or DDPPPD but this may vary substantially between cases. Witnesses may be available only to the plaintiff/prosecution, only to the defense, or to both sides of the case. Witnesses consist of both experts as well as lay witnesses. Judges are usually attorneys, coaches, law school students, and in some occasions, practicing judges.

All collegiate mock trial cases take place in the fictional state of Midlands, USA. Midlands is not geographically situated and falls under the protection of the United States Constitution.

======Tournament competition======
A tournament consists of four rounds, two on each side of the case, typically scored by two to three judges in each round. The season runs in two parts: the invitational season and the regular season. Invitational tournaments are held throughout the fall semester and into early spring across the country. At invitationals, teams have the opportunity to test out particular case theories and improve as competitors before facing the challenge and pressure of regular season competition.

The regular season begins in late January, starting with regional tournaments. There are typically more than 600 teams spread across 24 regional tournaments. Each school is limited to two post-regional bids to the &quot;Opening Round Championship Series.&quot; 192 teams advance to the Opening Round Championship, which is held at eight different tournament sites. The top teams at each Opening Round Championship Tournament qualify for a berth in the National Championship Tournament. There are 48 total bids to the final tournament. Previously, teams could earn up to two bids to either the National Championship Tournament (gold flight) or a National Tournament (silver flight) based on performance at Regionals. The two National Tournaments, which were held in March, consisted of 48 teams each, with the top 6 teams at each National earning a second-chance bid to the National Championship Tournament, which was held in April. The direct bid system was replaced by the current ORCS system in 2008.

For 22 years, the National Championship Tournament was held in Des Moines, Iowa, the city in which collegiate mock trial began. The tournament left Iowa for the first time in 2007 when Stetson University in St. Petersburg, Florida hosted the Championship. The 2008 National Championship Tournament was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Between 2009–2011, the Championship returned to Des Moines in odd-numbered years, while even-numbered years featured a different venue. The 2010 Championship was hosted by Rhodes College at courthouses in downtown Memphis, Tennessee, while the 2012 Championship was held in Minneapolis. Beginning in 2013, future Championships will be awarded solely on a competitive bidding process, although Des Moines, if it bids, will be given preference during &quot;landmark&quot; years, such as anniversaries of AMTA&#x27;s founding in 1985. The 2013 Championship was held in Washington, D.C., with the University of Virginia handling hosting duties. The 2014 Championship was held in Orlando, Florida at the Orange County Courthouse, with the University of Central Florida serving as the host institution. The 2015 Championship was hosted by the University of Cincinnati, with trials held at the Hamilton County Courthouse in Cincinnati. The 2016 Championship was hosted by Furman University in Greenville, South Carolina. In 2017, the Championship tournament was hosted by the University of California, Los Angeles in the Los Angeles County Superior Court (Stanley Mosk Courthouse) in downtown LA. In 2018, the Championship was hosted by Hamline University in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

======Past championship results======
In 2006, the University of Virginia beat Harvard University to win the National Championship. The University of Virginia won the championship by a single point using a tiebreaker, after a three judge panel split with one judge choosing Virginia as the winner, one choosing Harvard, and one calling the round a draw. The University of Virginia&#x27;s victory ended the then-recent run by UCLA, which had won the two previous national championships.

In 2007, the University of Virginia again defeated Harvard University. This marked the first ever re-match of a previous year&#x27;s final round. Virginia again won via a split decision, winning two of the three ballots in the final round. Virginia also became the 4th school to repeat as champions, joining UCLA, the University of Iowa, and Rhodes College, which accomplished the feat twice. Harvard University became the second program to finish as runner up in consecutive years, joining the University of Maryland, College Park. Maryland, however, had the distinction of losing to themselves in one of those two defeats.

In 2008, the University of Maryland prevailed over the George Washington University in a split-ballot decision (2–1). This was Maryland&#x27;s fifth title, giving them more total wins than any other university in AMTA history.

In 2009, Northwood University defeated George Washington University 5–0 to claim its first national championship.

In 2010, New York University defeated Harvard University 3–1–1 to win its first national championship. This was Harvard&#x27;s third championship round appearance in the last five years following its consecutive losses to Virginia.

In 2011, UCLA defeated defending champion New York University 4–1 to claim the Bruins&#x27; third title, the third-most in the history of the American Mock Trial Association.

In 2012, Duke defeated Rutgers 2–1, in what was the first championship round appearance for both squads.

In 2013, Florida State University defeated Rhodes College in FSU&#x27;s first championship round appearance by a 4–1 ballot decision. This was Rhodes&#x27; eighth championship round appearance to date. 2013 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 3 scoring judges per round (instead of 2).

In 2014, UCLA defeated Princeton University in a 3–2 ballot decision. With this victory, UCLA tied Rhodes for the second-highest record of championships (4 wins), behind University of Maryland, College Park (5 wins). This round was also Princeton&#x27;s first championship round appearance.

In 2015, Harvard defeated Yale in a 4-0–1 ballot decision. This marked Harvard&#x27;s first championship win, despite having been the runner-up 3 times previously (in 2006, 2007, and 2010). 2015 also marked Yale&#x27;s first championship round appearance. Finally, 2015 marked the first year that the case problem for the National Championship Tournament was different from the case schools had been using in competition for the earlier elimination rounds. (I.e. In the past colleges had argued the same case all year long, but starting in 2015 any team that qualified for the championship tournament was given a brand new case to learn and argue in the span of just a few weeks.)

In 2016, Yale won its first national championship in an 11–3–1 ballot decision, defeating the University of Virginia in the final trial. Yale is one of only nine schools to have competed in the final trial of the National Championship Tournament two years in a row. 2016 also marked the first year that the National Championship Tournament had 5 scoring judges per round, and 15 scoring judges in the final championship round.

In 2017, Virginia defeated Yale in a 6–1 ballot decision in a rematch of the 2016 final. Yale&#x27;s appearance marked the first time in collegiate championship history the same school has appeared three consecutive times in the final championship round.

In 2018, Miami University of Ohio defeated Yale in a 4–3 ballot decision. This was Miami&#x27;s second championship, the first having been in 2001. Yale extended its record of consecutive championship round appearances to 4, having been the champion in 2016 and the runner-up in 2017 and 2015.

In 2019, Yale University defeated Rhodes College in a 5–2 ballot decision. The decision was then vacated by the governing body, after an investigation concluded that Yale had violated tournament rules. Therefore, no winner was declared.

In 2020, the national championship (as well as several preliminary qualifier tournaments) was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, due to the ongoing pandemic, the national championship took place entirely remotely via video calls. In what was the closest final round in AMTA history, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County beat Yale when the panel of 11 judges was split 5–5 (with one tie), resulting in a narrow tiebreaker.

In 2022, Harvard University defeated the University of Chicago in a 3–2 ballot decision. This marked Harvard&#x27;s second championship title and Chicago&#x27;s first-ever appearance in a championship round.

In 2023, UCLA defeated Harvard University in a 5-4 ballot decision. This marked UCLA&#x27;s fifth championship title and Harvard&#x27;s sixth appearance in a championship round. UCLA&#x27;s victory moved it to a tie with U. of Maryland, College Park for most number of championship victories.

In 2024, Virginia defeated Hillsdale College in an 8-0-1 ballot decision, leading Virginia to their fourth championship and Hillsdale to their first final round appearance. Virginia&#x27;s victory moved their program to tie with Rhodes College for the second-most number of national titles.

The following is the list of winners of the National Championship Tournament, as well as the runners-up:
†The 2021 National Championship Tournament was held online due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

‡The 2020 National Championship Tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

*From 1992 until 2010, the &quot;Maryland Rule&quot; was in effect, which placed both teams from the same school in the same division in order to ensure there wouldn&#x27;t be another championship round between two teams from the same school. The Maryland Rule was repealed before the 2010–11 season.

National Championship Round Participants
*Yale also participated in the Championship Round in 2019, and won the initial judges&#x27; decision, but was later stripped of its title for violating tournament rules.

======Trial by Combat======
Beginning in 2018, Trial by Combat (TBC) has existed as an AMTA-adjacent mock trial competition. The tournament is held after the end of the competitive season (marked by the conclusion of the final round of the National Championship), typically in late June. It is currently co-hosted by the Drexel University Thomas R. Kline School of Law and the UCLA School of Law. The tournament &quot;aims to celebrate the best individual college competitors in the country—and identify the very best&quot;.

The format of Trial by Combat is markedly different from official AMTA tournaments. Rather than a successive narrowing of a field of teams throughout a competitive season, individual competitors submit applications to take part in the tournament, and the top 16 applicants are selected to compete. The competitors are chosen based on their respective school&#x27;s caliber of competition, the number of awards received at tournaments, appearances at ORCS and Nationals, amongst other factors. The selected competitors then receive the case materials on the morning of the first day of the competition, and have 24 hours to prepare. Each trial has one attorney and one witness per side. During the four preliminary rounds, each competitor performs each role once. Instead of the typical 1 to 10 scale for judging each performance, judges award a check mark to the competitor whose performance they preferred for each category. The four top-ranked students then proceed to Semifinals. The winning competitors of Semifinals compete as attorneys in the Championship Trial. The winner of the Championship Trial receives a full-size sword as their prize.

=====Law school=====
In the United States, law schools participate in interscholastic mock trial/trial advocacy. Teams typically consist of several &quot;attorneys&quot; and several &quot;witnesses&quot; on each side. A round consists of two law students acting as &quot;attorneys&quot; for each side.

The trial typically, although not always, begins with motions in limine and housekeeping matters, then moves through opening statements, witness testimony (both direct examination and cross examination), and finishes with a closing argument, sometimes called a summation. Throughout the trial, rules of evidence apply, typically the Federal Rules of Evidence, and objections are made applying these rules.

Every team in a tournament is given the same &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;case&quot;, typically several months in advance, but for some tournaments only a few weeks ahead of the tournament&#x27;s start. The problems can be criminal or civil, which affects many procedural aspects of the trial, for instance the increased rights of a criminal defendant not to testify against himself. The cases are written in an attempt to create an equal chance of either side prevailing, since the main objective is not to identify the winner of the case, but rather the team with superior advocacy skills.

Occasionally the winners of mock trial tournaments receive special awards such as money or invitations to special events, but the status of winning a tournament is significant in and of itself.

In addition, a university may require a mock trial course or courses as a requirement for graduation; among such universities is Baylor Law School, whose third-year Practice Court courses are mandatory for all students and have been since the school&#x27;s reopening in the 1920s.

<text>In insurance, the insurance policy is a contract (generally a standard form contract) between the insurer and the policyholder, which determines the claims which the insurer is legally required to pay. In exchange for an initial payment, known as the premium, the insurer promises to pay for loss caused by perils covered under the policy language.

Insurance contracts are designed to meet specific needs and thus have many features not found in many other types of contracts. Since insurance policies are standard forms, they feature boilerplate language which is similar across a wide variety of different types of insurance policies.

The insurance policy is generally an integrated contract, meaning that it includes all forms associated with the agreement between the insured and insurer. In some cases, however, supplementary writings such as letters sent after the final agreement can make the insurance policy a non-integrated contract. One insurance textbook states that generally &quot;courts consider all prior negotiations or agreements ... every contractual term in the policy at the time of delivery, as well as those written afterward as policy riders and endorsements ... with both parties&#x27; consent, are part of the written policy&quot;. The textbook also states that the policy must refer to all papers which are part of the policy. Oral agreements are subject to the parol evidence rule, and may not be considered part of the policy if the contract appears to be whole. Advertising materials and circulars are typically not part of a policy. Oral contracts pending the issuance of a written policy can occur.

==General features==
The insurance contract or agreement is a contract whereby the insurer promises to pay benefits to the insured or on their behalf to a third party if certain defined events occur. Subject to the &quot;fortuity principle&quot;, the event must be uncertain. The uncertainty can be either as to when the event will happen (e.g. in a life insurance policy, the time of the insured&#x27;s death is uncertain) or as to if it will happen at all (e.g. in a fire insurance policy, whether or not a fire will occur at all).

* Insurance contracts are generally considered contracts of adhesion because the insurer draws up the contract and the insured has little or no ability to make material changes to it. This is interpreted to mean that the insurer bears the burden if there is any ambiguity in any terms of the contract. Insurance policies are sold without the policyholder even seeing a copy of the contract. In 1970 Robert Keeton suggested that many courts were actually applying &#x27;reasonable expectations&#x27; rather than interpreting ambiguities, which he called the &#x27;reasonable expectations doctrine&#x27;. This doctrine has been controversial, with some courts adopting it and others explicitly rejecting it. In several jurisdictions, including California, Wyoming, and Pennsylvania, the insured is bound by clear and conspicuous terms in the contract even if the evidence suggests that the insured did not read or understand them.
* Insurance contracts are aleatory in that the amounts exchanged by the insured and insurer are unequal and depend upon uncertain future events. In contrast, ordinary non-insurance contracts are commutative in that the amounts (or values) exchanged are usually intended by the parties to be roughly equal. This distinction is particularly important in the context of exotic products such as finite risk insurance that contain &quot;commutation&quot; provisions.
* Insurance contracts are unilateral, meaning that only the insurer makes legally enforceable promises in the contract. The insured is not required to pay the premiums, but the insurer is required to pay the benefits under the contract if the insured has paid the premiums and met certain other basic provisions.
* Insurance contracts are governed by the principle of utmost good faith (), which requires both parties of the insurance contract to deal in good faith and in particular, imparts on the insured a duty to disclose all material facts that relate to the risk to be covered. This contrasts with the legal doctrine that covers most other types of contracts, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). In the United States, the insured can sue an insurer in tort for acting in bad faith.

==Structure==

Insurance contracts were traditionally written on the basis of every single type of risk (where risks were defined extremely narrowly), and a separate premium was calculated and charged for each. Only those individual risks expressly described or &quot;scheduled&quot; in the policy were covered; hence, those policies are now described as &quot;individual&quot; or &quot;schedule&quot; policies. This system of &quot;named perils&quot; or &quot;specific perils&quot; coverage proved to be unsustainable in the context of the Second Industrial Revolution, in that a typical large conglomerate might have dozens of types of risks to insure against. For example, in 1926, an insurance industry spokesman noted that a bakery would have to buy a separate policy for each of the following risks: manufacturing operations, elevators, teamsters, product liability, contractual liability (for a spur track connecting the bakery to a nearby railroad), premises liability (for a retail store), and owners&#x27; protective liability (for negligence of contractors hired to make any building modifications).

In 1941, the insurance industry began to shift to the current system where covered risks are initially defined broadly in an &quot;all risk&quot; or &quot;all sums&quot; insuring agreement on a general policy form (e.g., &quot;We will pay all sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages...&quot;), then narrowed down by subsequent exclusion clauses (e.g., &quot;This insurance does not apply to...&quot;). If the insured desires coverage for a risk taken out by an exclusion on the standard form, the insured can sometimes pay an additional premium for an endorsement to the policy that overrides the exclusion.

Insurers have been criticized in some quarters for the development of complex policies with layers of interactions between coverage clauses, conditions, exclusions, and exceptions to exclusions. In a case interpreting one ancestor of the modern &quot;products-completed operations hazard&quot; clause, the Supreme Court of California complained: 
==Parts of an insurance contract==
* Declarations - Identifies who is an insured, the insured&#x27;s address, the insuring company, what risks or property are covered, the policy limits (amount of insurance), any applicable deductibles, the policy number, the policy period, and the premium amount. These are usually provided on a form that is filled out by the insurer based on the insured&#x27;s application and attached on top of or inserted within the first few pages of the policy. 
* Definitions - Defines important terms used in the rest of the policy.
* Insuring agreement - Describes the covered perils, or risks assumed, or nature of coverage. This is where the insurance company makes one or more express promises to indemnify the insured. 
* Exclusions - Takes coverage away from the insuring agreement by describing property, perils, hazards or losses arising from specific causes which are not covered by the policy.
* Conditions - These are specific provisions, rules of conduct, duties, and obligations that the insured must comply with in order for coverage to incept or must remain in compliance with in order to keep coverage in effect. If policy conditions are not met, the insurer can deny the claim.
* Policy form - The definitions, insuring agreement, exclusions, and conditions are typically combined into a single integrated document called a policy form. Some insurers call it a coverage form or coverage part. When multiple coverage forms are packaged into a single policy, the declarations will state as much, and then there may be additional declarations specific to each coverage form. Traditionally, policy forms have been so rigidly standardized that they have no blank spaces to be filled in. Instead, they always expressly refer to terms or amounts stated in the declarations. If the policy needs to be customized beyond what is possible with the declarations, then the underwriter attaches endorsements or riders. 
* Endorsements - Additional forms attached to the policy that modify it in some way, either unconditionally or upon the existence of some condition. Endorsements can make policies difficult to read for nonlawyers; they may revise, expand, or delete clauses located many pages earlier in one or more coverage forms, or even modify each other. Because it is very risky to allow nonlawyer underwriters to directly rewrite policy forms with word processors, insurers usually direct underwriters to modify them by attaching endorsements preapproved by counsel for various common modifications. 
* Riders - A rider is used to convey the terms of a policy amendment and the amendment thereby becomes part of the policy. Riders are dated and numbered so that both insurer and policyholder can determine provisions and the benefit level. Common riders to group medical plans involve name changes, change to eligible classes of employees, change in level of benefits, or the addition of a managed care arrangement such as a Health Maintenance Organization or Preferred Provider Organization (PPO). 
* Jackets - The term has several distinct and confusing meanings. In general, it refers to some set of standard boilerplate provisions which accompanies all policies at the time of delivery. Some insurers refer to a package of standard documents shared across an entire family of policies as a &quot;jacket.&quot; Some insurers extend this to include policy forms, so that the only parts of the policy not part of the jacket are the declarations, endorsements, and riders. Other insurers use the term &quot;jacket&quot; in a manner closer to its ordinary meaning: a binder, envelope, or presentation folder with pockets in which the policy may be delivered, or a cover sheet to which the policy forms are stapled or which is stapled on top of the policy. The standard boilerplate provisions are then printed on the jacket itself.

==Industry standard forms ==
In the United States, property and casualty insurers typically use similar or even identical language in their standard insurance policies, which are drafted by advisory organizations such as the Insurance Services Office and the American Association of Insurance Services. This reduces the regulatory burden for insurers as policy forms must be approved by states; it also allows consumers to more readily compare policies, albeit at the expense of consumer choice. In addition, as policy forms are reviewed by courts, the interpretations become more predictable as courts elaborate upon the interpretation of the same clauses in the same policy forms, rather than different policies from different insurers.

In recent years, however, insurers have increasingly modified the standard forms in company-specific ways or declined to adopt changes to standard forms. For example, a review of home insurance policies found substantial differences in various provisions. In some areas such as directors and officers liability insurance and personal umbrella insurance there is little industry-wide standardization.

===Manuscript policies and endorsements===

For the vast majority of insurance policies, the only page that is heavily custom-written to the insured&#x27;s needs is the declarations page. All other pages are standard forms that refer back to terms defined in the declarations as needed. However, certain types of insurance, such as media insurance, are written as manuscript policies, which are either custom-drafted from scratch or written from a mix of standard and nonstandard forms. By analogy, policy endorsements that are not written on standard forms or whose language is custom-written to fit the insured&#x27;s particular circumstances are known as manuscript endorsements.

<text>The Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) is a voluntary, non-profit association for the support and governance of interscholastic activities at high schools in Minnesota, United States. 
The association supports interscholastic athletics and fine arts programs for member schools. Membership includes nearly 500 schools, including special schools, home schools, and 435 high schools. 
The State High School League is an affiliate of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS).

The League also addresses sportsmanship, chemical health, scholarship recognition, and oversees tournament officials and judges. 
The League provides educational programs for coaches. 
The organization&#x27;s operating revenue is derived from tournament ticket sales, broadcast rights, corporate sponsorship, and sale of tournament merchandise.

==History==

The MSHSL was founded in 1916 as the State High School Athletic Association (SHSAA) in order to promote and regulate school athletics. It later expanded its mission to include fine arts programs. In 1922, SHSAA joined the National Federation of State High School Associations. In 1929, the State High School Athletic Association adopted a new name, the Minnesota State High School League, as well as a new vision. The League started accepting non-public schools&#x27; applications for admitance in 1974.

In 1960, the MSHSL was sanctioned as a non-profit by a Minnesota State Statute.

Beginning with the 2015 season, the MSHSL created geographic football districts for regular season scheduling. The change was designed to help programs having difficulty finding opponents for an eight-game schedule.

In 2015, the MNHSL board approved a policy on transgender athletes that allowed those assigned male at birth that identify as female to be eligible for girls’ teams. Girls, and by extension athletes assigned female at birth that no longer identify as such, were already eligible to compete in boys&#x27; sports. The policy requires applying for eligibility, sets out criteria for approval including a written statement from a health care professional, and places the decision with the school&#x27;s activities director. Religiously-affiliated private schools are exempt from the policy.

THe MSHSL was the first state association to officially sanction women&#x27;s hockey, adapted athletics, robotics, and clay target.

==Class System==

On April 17, 1975, the member schools of the Minnesota State High School League approved amendments that provided the changes necessary to implement reorganization for two class competition. Prior to this, schools of all sizes were competing against each other. The idea behind the division was to reduce the inherent advantage that was given to the larger schools. The Board of Directors assigned the largest 128 schools by enrollment to the AA classification. All other member schools were assigned to Class A. Each class is then split into eight sections, with the number of teams in each section varying. In April 1983 the Board of Directors adopted a policy which assigned schools with a minimum enrollment of 500 students to Class AA and schools with an enrollment 1–499 to Class A. Depending on the number of schools participating in an activity, additional classes may be needed or no class system may be needed at all. The highest current class in any activity is AAAAAA (6A) for football.

==Post season==

===Section tournaments===
At the end of the regular season, every MSHSL team is seeded into a sectional tournament. For each class, the state is divided into 8 sections. 
Every two years, the MSHSL determines a school&#x27;s activity classification and section placement. Different sections have different numbers of teams depending upon the class and activity in question. For example, most sections in football have 8 teams. In a typical 8-team section, all 8 teams will make the playoffs regardless of their regular season record. If a football section has 9 teams, then the ninth team will not make the playoffs. In all other sports, every team advances to the postseason. In basketball, for Classes AAAA and AAA, a typical section has 8 team, whereas a typical section in Class AA has about 16 teams, and a Class A section can have 20 or more. In these cases where a section has more or less teams than an even 8 or 16, higher seeded teams may receive byes, or lower seeded teams may have to play an extra play-in game. The other option is for a section to be divided into two 8-team (or more) sub-sections with the sub-section champions playing for the section title.

These sections are strictly geographical, and are normally numbered from Southeast to Northwest. Thus, with football, for example, Section 1AAA would have schools in Class AAA that are from the Southeastern part of the state, while Section 7AAAA will have Class AAAA schools from the Northeastern part of the state. As a general rule, this serves pretty well, however it breaks down when dealing with the larger classes. In Class AAAAA Football, given the concentration of large schools in the Twin Cities Metro, Section 1AAAAA comprises the three Rochester public schools, Owatonna, and two southern suburbs. At the other end, Section 8AAAAA covers the entire northern half of the state with Bemidji, Brainerd, Moorhead, Sartell, Alexandria, and one of the St. Cloud public schools. Sections 2AAAAA-7AAAAA are a mixture of suburbs, exurbs and Minneapolis/St. Paul schools.

Each section has its own methods and procedures for determining seeding in the section tournament. Some sections use elaborate point systems while others base seeding simply on records. The winner of the section tournament advances to State.

===State tournaments===
The winners of the section tournaments are seeded into a single elimination state tournament. Pairings of section champion at State are predetermined before the season by the MSHSL. 
In the Fall of 2005, the MSHSL experimented by having coaches seed the State Soccer Tournament.

==Activities==
The following sports are offered under the supervision of the MSHSL. All of these sports have a single elimination tournament at the end of the season which awards a state championship to the winning team. Some sports also award individual championships as well.

For a complete list of state championship winners by sport see the list of Minnesota State High School League State Championships.

==Conferences==

Because of the large number of high schools and large distances spanned between some of them, many schools are organized into conferences.
These conferences, which, according to Minnesota State High School League rules, must have a minimum of five members, are usually composed of schools that are in close geographic proximity and have similar enrollments. During the regular season, a school plays a number of its games against other teams in its conference (this number varies depending on the sport and conference in question). However, unlike with organizations such as the California Interscholastic Federation or Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association, a team&#x27;s conference standing has no bearing on its postseason. Since every team makes the playoffs and seeding is done at the discretion of the section, a team&#x27;s conference performance has no direct effect on its postseason fate. A team could win its conference, but still be seeded lower than teams that finished behind it due to other considerations such as overall record, or the strength of opponents. Often, teams from one conference are spread over different sections and sometimes different classes. 
Some single sport conferences also exist, especially for hockey.

<text>In mathematics, the grand Riemann hypothesis is a generalisation of the Riemann hypothesis and generalized Riemann hypothesis. It states that the nontrivial zeros of all automorphic &quot;L&quot;-functions lie on the critical line formula_1 with formula_2 a real number variable and formula_3 the imaginary unit.

The modified grand Riemann hypothesis is the assertion that the nontrivial zeros of all automorphic &quot;L&quot;-functions lie on the critical line or the real line.

== Notes ==
* Robert Langlands, in his general functoriality conjectures, asserts that all global &quot;L&quot;-functions should be automorphic.
* The Siegel zero, conjectured not to exist, is a possible real zero of a Dirichlet &quot;L&quot;-series, rather near &quot;s&quot; = 1.
* &quot;L&quot;-functions of Maass cusp forms can have trivial zeros which are off the real line.

<text>Miguel Cárdenas (September 29, 1855 – May 24, 1930) was a Mexican lawyer and politician. He was candidate for the elections of 1894 for the post of governor of Coahuila and was supported by Bernardo Reyes. But Cárdenas removed his candidacy as did José María Garza Galán. So, José María Múzquiz became governor. Eventually, Miguel Cárdenas became governor in 1894. He was governor until 1909. In 1905 Francisco Madero unsuccessfully opposed his reelection.

<doc id="669878" wikidata="Q5141301" url="?curid=669878" title="Cohansey River">
<text>The Cohansey River, also called Cohansey Creek, is a river in southern New Jersey of the United States. It drains approximately of rural agricultural and forested lowlands on the north shore of Delaware Bay.

It rises in central Salem County approximately southeast of Woodstown, and flows south through rural Cumberland County. It flows through Sunset Lake, which is also fed from Mary Elmer Lake, both of which are located in the park system of the city of Bridgeton.

At Bridgeton, the river becomes navigable, although very shallow at low tide: one-foot to a few inches coming through downtown Bridgeton. The city boat ramp downtown is unusable during low tide due to about of mud between the channel and the ramp. The river widens into a tidal estuary, approximately long, that flows south, then west, entering Cohansey Cove on Delaware Bay, approximately southwest of Bridgeton. The mouth of the estuary is surrounded by extensive wetlands and salt marshes.

In colonial times, the river provided an anchorage for vessels approaching Philadelphia. In 1774, the small port village of Greenwich on the river near its mouth was the scene of an incident similar to the more famous Boston Tea Party in which imported tea was burned as a protest against taxation. The river was also known as the Cesaria River in colonial times.

==Navigation and Coast pilot==
The Cohansey River is in Region 3 of the US Coast Guard and NOAA Mapping system. The following information is reproduced from the US government coast pilot information. This is from the 39th edition and may be out of data, so please do not use this for navigation: Cohansey River, which empties into the northeast side of Delaware Bay 31 miles northwestward of Cape May Light, is used mostly by pleasure craft, although some petroleum is transported to Bridgeton. Cohansey Light (39°20&#x27;30&quot;N., 75°21&#x27;41&quot;W.), 42 feet above the water, is shown from a black skeleton tower with a white daymark on the south side near the natural entrance. A dredged cut through the narrow neck of land on which the light stands gives a more direct approach to the river; the cut, 0.3 mile northwest of Cohansey Light, is marked on its west side by lights at the inner and outer ends.

The river is unmarked above the dredged cut. In April 1990, the controlling depths were 5 feet to Fairton; thence in 1990-September 2003, shoaling to less than 1 foot to Bridgeton. The usual approach to Cohansey River is along the axis of the dredged cut, but the natural channel eastward of Cohansey Light is sometimes used; the latter has a controlling depth of about 7 feet, and unmarked shoals with depths of 4 to 6 feet must be avoided on either side. Local knowledge is advised when using this approach and in the dredged channel in the upper part of the river off Bridgeton.
