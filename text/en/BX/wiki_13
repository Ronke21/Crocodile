<text>Kings Norton, alternatively King&#x27;s Norton, is an area of Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Historically in Worcestershire, it was also a Birmingham City Council ward within the borough of Birmingham. The district lies 6.5 miles south-southwest of Birmingham city centre and is within 1.5 miles of the north Worcestershire border. Kings Norton has been split into two wards, Kings Norton North and Kings Norton South.

==History==

There was Romano-British occupation near the later town. Excavations at Kings Norton found signs of a small Romano-British settlement, including Roman pottery and a Roman ditch at Parsons Hill, near Icknield Street.

Kings Norton derives its origin from the basic Early English &quot;Nor + tun&quot;, meaning North settlement and belonging to or held by the king, when Kings Norton was the northernmost of the or outlying manors of Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. Before 1066 these manors with many others in Birmingham had belonged to Earl Edwin, the Anglo-Saxon Earl of Mercia. When in that year a Viking army sailed up the River Humber to invade England, Edwin went to do battle, but was heavily defeated at the Battle of Fulford Bridge near York. King Harold arrived the next day, and after defeating the Vikings at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, immediately marched back south to be himself defeated at the Battle of Hastings. Edwin and his broken remnant of an army were unable go with him. Thus, after the Norman Conquest, when William punished Harold&#x27;s supporters, Edwin was not amongst them and did not forfeit his lands. Two years later, however, Edwin revolted against William who confiscated his holdings to give as rewards to his followers. Bromsgrove and its berewicks he kept, with himself both as tenant-in-chief and manorial lord. Thus, the manor became Kings Norton remained royal from Domesday until 1804. 

===Civil war===
Kings Norton was the scene of a couple of minor incidents during the English Civil War. In the first of these, a force led by Prince Rupert of the Rhine, numbering some 300, was resting on Kings Norton Green. There, they were surprised by a smaller group led by Lord Willoughby of Parham. A skirmish took place, in which fifty of Prince Rupert&#x27;s men were killed, and twenty were taken prisoner. The Parliamentarian force lost twenty men. This took place on 17 October 1642.

In a later incident, Queen Henrietta Maria arrived in Kings Norton with an army of around 5,500 men that she had raised in Yorkshire. It is believed that she stayed the night in the Saracen&#x27;s Head, while the army camped on land behind the church, now Kings Norton Park (giving rise to the modern road name &quot;Camp Lane&quot;). There is also a public house on this road named &quot;The Camp Inn&quot;.

===Markets and fairs===
In 1616, King James granted permission to hold markets and fairs at Kings Norton. Both the original fairs and the market eventually fell into disuse. At some later date, a mop fair began to be held on the Green on the first Monday of October. A mop fair was a hiring fair where people would go looking for employment. After the decline of hiring fairs, the mop became a village fête organised by the Round Table and raising money for local people. More recently, the Round Table handed over running the mop to a commercial fun fair. A new farmers&#x27; market was set up in 2005, operating on The Green once a month.

===Industrialisation and expansion===
In 1796, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was built through Kings Norton, linking Birmingham to the River Severn. This was linked to the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal by Kings Norton Junction, allowing access to Stratford-upon-Avon and, more significantly, the Grand Union Canal. Just beyond the junction is a rare example of a guillotine lock used here as a stop lock.

Discontent with Parliamentary under-representation led to the Priestley Riots in Birmingham 1791, in which buildings including Moseley Hall were burnt down in King&#x27;s Norton.

Kings Norton, along with many of the small towns near Birmingham, expanded considerably in the 19th century with a railway link into Birmingham passing by the new Bournville factory just to the north. Historically, Kings Norton had been part of Worcestershire, but from 1898, it was part of the King&#x27;s Norton and Northfield urban district until added to Birmingham in 1911 by the Greater Birmingham Act. In 1911 the civil parish had a population of 49,160. On 9 November 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

===Urbanisation===

During the 20th century, the area grew further with additional private and public housing. In October 1920, 25½ acres of land at Kings Norton (just below St Nicolas&#x27; Church) were purchased by the Birmingham Civic Society and afterwards presented to the city for the benefit of the citizens of Birmingham. The Society also designed and paid for the formal gardens, gates on the Pershore Road side and stone benches.

In 1937 the Birmingham Medical Officer of Health reported that &#x27;a substantial number of dwellings in King&#x27;s Norton village [are] unfit for human habitation&#x27;, with many of the houses affected over a hundred years old. In June 1937 the City Council ordered the making of clearance orders, under section 25 of the Housing Act, 1936. With the clearance of city centre slum housing, there was a pressing need for additional social housing in Birmingham. As part of this programme, the City Council built several new housing estates in Kings Norton, including the Wychall Farm and Pool Farm estates in the 1950s and the Primrose and Hawkesley estates in the 1960s and 1970s. These new estates occupied land that had previously been open farmland, most notably the area known as the Three Estates (Pool Farm, Primrose and Hawkesley), which lies mostly to the east of the Birmingham and Worcester canal and the A441 Redditch Road.

In the mid-1970s, a large housing estate featuring both private and social housing as well as a small shopping area (although many of the shops have long since closed), a public house, a primary school and a day centre was built on what was once the Kings Norton Golf Course and is often colloquially referred to as the &#x27;Golf Course Estate&#x27;.

The Wychall Farm housing estate, which is in the historic parish of Kings Norton, was developed by the city council during the 1950s, and also included Wychall Farm Primary School, for pupils aged 5–11 years, which opened in 1956. However, the housing fell into increasing disrepair towards the end of the 20th century and by the summer of 2006 a demolition programme had begun on the estate, with 500 homes demolished to make way for a 350-home housing association development. Within three years, most of the demolition had been completed and some of the new homes were already occupied.

==Education==
Over the years, Kings Norton has had many educational institutions named after the area and built in the area. They include:
* Ark Kings Academy
* Cadbury Sixth Form College
* King&#x27;s Norton Boys&#x27; School
* Kings Norton Girls&#x27; School
* St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School
* Broadmeadow Junior School
* Fairway Primary School
* Hawkesley Church Primary School
* Kings Norton Primary School
* St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School

==Places of interest==

St Nicolas&#x27; Church dates from the 13th century, and the spire dates from the 15th century. In addition, the Green contains three later medieval buildings from the 15th century: the Old Grammar School, the Saracen&#x27;s Head and number 10 The Green. 
In the summer of 2004, two of these ancient buildings, the Saracen&#x27;s Head and the Old Grammar School, were the winners of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Restoration&quot; competition and were awarded over £3 million towards the cost of major refurbishment. In 2006, planning permission was granted for the restoration of these buildings, and work started.

The Old Grammar School and Saracen&#x27;s Head were reopened to the public in June 2008, and in December 2008 were renamed as Saint Nicolas Place.

It is possible to visit &quot;Saint Nicolas Place&quot; to see the room where Queen Henrietta Maria is reputed to have stayed 1643.

===Kings Norton Park===

Kings Norton Park is an urban park in Kings Norton. It contains a small to medium-sized skateboarding park made from a mixture of polished concrete and steel equipment for use in Skateboarding and BMX Stunt Riding, and use by other extreme sports enthusiasts providing a mixed environment consisting of both flat urban terrain, as well as the more common ramps and railings.

Amongst some of the features available are a concrete half pipe with a deck at each end, a Funbox that includes a flat rail, stairs with a ledge on either side, a Vulcano which also has ledge, as well as a concrete spine with Coping.

There are also two Roll-ins at either end of the skatepark, one with a long, shallow gradient side ramp at the street end.

==Transport==
Modern Kings Norton lies on the A441 Pershore Road South, which runs between Birmingham and Redditch to the south. It also has a railway station on the Cross-City Line. The line of Icknield or Ryknild Street, a Roman road running northwards from Alcester via Metchley Fort in Edgbaston towards Sutton Coldfield and beyond, can be traced through the eastern edge of the district.

Buses run to Birmingham city centre every few minutes along the Pershore Road and are mostly operated by National Express West Midlands. Previously Midland Red West operated service 146 to Redditch and Evesham but this was cut back to operate between Redditch and Evesham only.

==Industry==

In 1918 and 1919 the Kings Norton Metal Company produced British one penny coins on contract from the Royal Mint, these pennies are identified by a mintmark to the left of the date of &quot;KN&quot;. The company also produced coins for other countries.
This company, many years later after many partnerships and takeovers, was in part to become the Birmingham Mint located at the site of the Heaton mint in Icknield Street, Birmingham

A substantial paper mill was built by James Baldwin &amp; Sons Ltd in the 1860s on Lifford Lane, which was operational until 1967. Part of the mill building still exists as the Lakeside Centre.

Kings Norton is home to the world-famous glass manufacturers Triplex (now part of Pilkington).

==Redevelopment==
A number of redevelopment projects have proved necessary because of the deteriorating quality of the social housing in Kings Norton.

In 1999, the Pool Farm, Primrose and Hawkesley housing estates, collectively known as the &#x27;Three Estates&#x27;, were awarded a regeneration grant as part of the government&#x27;s New Deal for the Community programme (NDC). The award of £50 million is designed to run over ten years. Unlike earlier government regeneration programmes, NDC is able to focus on issues such as health and employment as well as on housing. Following considerable consultation, a major rebuild of the estates is planned.

A major redevelopment of the Wychall Farm estate, in the historic parish of Northfield, in the west of Kings Norton, was started in 2001. The previous housing was built using a system build approach that had exceeded its projected life-span. Bromford Housing Association have led the redevelopment.

A large, new, private housing estate was built on the site of Monyhull Hall Hospital, just inside the boundary of Kings Norton ward.

==Politics==
Kings Norton is in the area of Birmingham City Council, a metropolitan unitary authority. Three councillors have been elected for Kings Norton since the local government elections in May 2011. At present Kings Norton is made up two wards of the city council: Kings Norton North and Kings Norton South, represented by Alex Aitken (KNN, Labour) and Peter Griffiths (KNS, Labour).

Kings Norton became part of Northfield district in 2006, partitioned from Selly Oak. In 2004, the ward boundary was changed as part of citywide boundary alterations overseen by the Boundary Commission for England. This saw the addition of a small area of the Birmingham, Hall Green constituency in the east of the ward, and a small area of the Birmingham, Northfield constituency at the south of the ward in the West Heath area.

Most of Kings Norton is in Birmingham Northfield parliamentary constituency, represented by Laurence Turner, although some parts of Kings Norton lie within Birmingham Selly Oak and are represented by Alistair Carns.

Kings Norton ward has adopted a Ward Support Officer; the current officer is Bob Barr.

<doc id="663196" wikidata="Q7754085" url="?curid=663196" title="The Night I Fell in Love (song)">
<text>&quot;The Night I Fell in Love&quot; is a song on the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; 2002 album &quot;Release&quot;. The lyrics were written by Neil Tennant and the music co-written with Chris Lowe.

The song describes a homosexual encounter between a teenage boy (who is telling the story) and his rap music idol after a concert. The idol is never named, but references in the lyrics to Dr. Dre and homophobia in rap music make it possible to identify him as music superstar Eminem. The most obvious reference is when the musician refers to Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Stan&quot;:

: &quot;Then he joked &quot;hey man,&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;your name isn&#x27;t Stan, is it?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;We should be together!&quot;&quot;

Discussing the song&#x27;s inspiration Tennant said: &quot;Eminem&#x27;s defence of the homophobic lyrics on his albums has always been that he&#x27;s not speaking as himself, he&#x27;s speaking as a character, and he&#x27;s representing homophobia in America...I thought it would be quite interesting to take that method and just to imagine a scene where a boy meets a famous rap star backstage at his concert and is surprised to discover he&#x27;s gay and ends up sleeping with him. Just to present rap in this homosexual context. I mean, there obviously are gay rap stars.&quot;

Eminem responded to the track in his song &quot;Canibitch&quot;, in which Eminem and Dr. Dre run over the Pet Shop Boys with their car:

: &quot;[BOOSH! BOOSH!]&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;[BOOSH! BOOSH!]&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;(What was that?) Pet Shop Boys&quot;

== Reception ==
Robert Christgau said of the track, &quot;The Eminem track is . . . wondrous, transcendent, a blow against rap homophobia, a great work of art. If buying this album is the only way you can hear it, don&#x27;t hesitate.&quot;

<doc id="663197" wikidata="Q266520" url="?curid=663197" title="Nicholas Hammond">
<text>Nicholas Hammond (born 15 May 1950) is an American and Australian actor and writer who is best known for his roles as Friedrich von Trapp in the film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the 1970s television series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man.&quot; He also appeared in the film &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1977) and its two sequels.

==Early life==
Hammond was born on May 15, 1950, in Washington, D.C., the son of Colonel Thomas West Hammond, Jr. by his wife Eileen Hammond (née Bennett). Hammond&#x27;s father was American of English descent and an officer in the U.S. Army, and his mother was English and had played a role in &quot;Much Too Shy&quot; in 1942. Hammond has one elder brother, David (b. 1946). Hammond&#x27;s parents had met and married in London during World War II when his father had been posted in the United Kingdom. After the war, the couple moved to the U.S. permanently, and because the Colonel had an army job, the family moved numerous times to various army stations across the country during Hammond&#x27;s childhood. Nicholas Hammond graduated from the Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland, before attending and graduating from Princeton University. Col. Hammond died in 1970.

==Career==
Hammond was 11 years old when he made his acting debut as Robin Rhodes in the Broadway play &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot; in 1961, playing alongside Michael Redgrave and Googie Withers.

At the same time, he began to shoot for the 1963 film &quot;Lord of the Flies,&quot; which marked his film debut. After this, Hammond played what was to be his most notable screen role: Friedrich von Trapp (the elder of the two boys) in the 1965 hit &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;.

Hammond&#x27;s next acting role came in 1970, when he appeared in &quot;Conduct Unbecoming,&quot; his first role as an adult. In 1972 Hammond appeared as Peter Linder in &quot;Skyjacked&quot;. In 1973 he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; in season 4, episode #090, &quot;The Subject Was Noses&quot;, as the high school hunk, Doug Simpson, who loses interest in Marcia after her tragic football accident. That year Hammond also appeared in &quot;The Waltons&quot; episode &quot;The Townie&quot;, as Theodore Claypool Jr.

After making the transition from juvenile to young leading man, Hammond spent several seasons in daytime soaps, such as &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He also appeared on many television shows of the 1970s including &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

In the late 1970s Hammond re-joined fellow &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; alumnus Heather Menzies (who played Louisa von Trapp) for one episode of the TV adaptation of &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;. He also contributed to &quot;The Sound of Music Family Scrapbook&quot;.

===&quot;Spider-Man&quot;===

From 1977 to 1979, Hammond played the role for which he is perhaps best known, as Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the television series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, being the first actor to play a live-action Peter Parker and the second live-action Spider-Man. Hammond described his approach to the character: &quot;I liked the idea of taking a fantasy hero and making him believable as a person. I made it clear going into it that I wasn&#x27;t interested in doing something that was just a camp joke.&quot;

The series aired sporadically on CBS, with 13 episodes airing over two seasons. A pilot movie appeared in the fall of 1977, with the series returning as a mid-season replacement for five episodes in the spring of 1978. While the show did well in the ratings, CBS was unwilling to commit to a regular timeslot due to its relatively weak showing in the lucrative adult demographic. The second season aired six episodes, each an hour long, in the fall of 1978 and winter of 1979, with a final two-hour episode in the summer of that year. Although Hammond played Peter Parker in the television series, in all of the scenes in which Spider-Man is seen performing stunts or without dialogue, a stunt double was filmed by a second camera unit.

===Later career===

After the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series ended, Hammond guest-starred on a number TV shows of the early 1980s, including &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, and he played recurring roles on &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; and &quot;Dallas&quot;.

After being cast as yachtsman Dennis Conner in the 1986 Australian TV miniseries &quot;The Challenge&quot;, about the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup challenge, Hammond liked the country so much that he decided to stay. He later became an Australian citizen and has since then appeared in several television miniseries filmed in Australia.

Among these was an important role as an American WWII officer based in Far North Queensland, in the major miniseries &quot;Fields of Fire&quot;, series I and II, set in the cane fields of tropical Australia. His character represented the gentler side of the culture clash between Australians and Americans. He had a starring role as Sir Ivor Creevy-Thorne in &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot;, an Australia/New Zealand extended miniseries (a complete story of 20 serialised episodes, with cliffhangers between each of the episodes). Hammond also guest-starred in various Australian television series, including satirical television programs such as &quot;BackBerner&quot; and &quot;CNNNN&quot;, the science fiction program &quot;Farscape&quot;, and dramatic series such as &quot;The Flying Doctors&quot;, &quot;MDA&quot; and the Australian/USA co-production &quot;&quot; (which was filmed in Australia).

In 2005, Hammond portrayed television producer Aaron Spelling in &quot;&quot;, a fictionalized television movie based on the creation and production of &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

Hammond is a writer for Australian television, having written both the miniseries &quot;A Difficult Woman&quot; and the television film &quot;Secret Men&#x27;s Business&quot;. In 2009, he made his directing debut with &quot;Lying Cheating Bastard&quot;, a play he co-wrote with magician James Galea.

In 2019, he portrayed director Sam Wanamaker in the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hammond married Laura Soli in 1980, and the couple divorced in 1984. He moved to Australia in the mid-1980s and now lives in Sydney, with the Australian actress Robyn Nevin.

He has remained close friends with his &quot;Sound of Music&quot; siblings, several of whom joined a multitude of other actors and co-stars for the &#x27;Save the Rose Theatre&#x27; campaign&#x27;s street event, amid talent from many international productions.

<doc id="663199" wikidata="Q1982233" url="?curid=663199" title="Longbridge plant">
<text>The Longbridge plant is an industrial complex in Longbridge, Birmingham, England, currently leased by SAIC as a research and development facility for its MG Motor subsidiary. Vehicle assembly ended in 2016.

Opened in 1905, by the late 1960s, Longbridge employed around 25,000 workers, building cars including the original Mini.

In the Second World War, the main plant produced munitions and tank parts, while the nearby East Works of Austin Aero Ltd at Cofton Hackett produced Short Stirling and Hawker Hurricane aircraft.

Since the collapse of MG Rover in 2005, part of the site has been redeveloped for commercial and residential use.

== History of Longbridge car industry ==

===Foundation===

====White and Pike: 1895–1901====
The original site and factory development was undertaken by Birmingham-based copper-plate printers White and Pike Ltd. Looking to consolidate a number of small sites around Birmingham, and diversify into new areas, they chose a series of 20 agricultural fields in Northfield eight miles to the south of the city on the Bristol Road at Longbridge. The site was bounded by Lickey Road, Lowhill Lane, the Midland Railway&#x27;s main Birmingham to Gloucester mainline, and the Halesowen Joint Railway with the Great Western Railway. The purchase also included Cofton Hill, which rose above its surroundings. Designed by Stark &amp; Rowntree of Glasgow and constructed by James Moffatt &amp; Sons of Camp Hill, the factory was built at a cost of £105,000, opening in the first quarter of 1895. Unfortunately, the venture failed, and the site was repossessed by the bank in 1901.

====Austin: 1906–1914====

Herbert Austin, who was born in Buckinghamshire and raised in Yorkshire, escaped his intended railway engineering apprenticeship and learnt his trade under an uncle in Melbourne, Australia. He returned to England in 1893 as manager of an Australian company relocating to Birmingham. In 1901, with the Vickers brothers, he founded and ran Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company, which became Britain&#x27;s largest car manufacturer.

In 1905, he fell out with the Vickers brothers, and looking to found his own motor car company, Herbert Austin undertook numerous exploratory rides around Birmingham in his Wolseley 7.5-horsepower On 4 November 1905, he found the derelict printing works, owned by a financier, E A Olivieri. Friends came forward with financial help, and with additional invoice financing from Frank Kayser of Kayser, Ellison and Company, and William Harvey du Cros of the Dunlop Rubber Company, enabled Austin to buy the site and an additional from Olivieri for £7,500 on 22 January 1906.

Austin and his initial workforce of the Austin Motor Company had, in fact, moved into the derelict buildings before this date, as Austin was so focused on showing his new car at the British Motor Show, to be held in November 1906 at Olympia, London. On paper, the first Austin was described as a 25-30 h.p. high-class touring car with a four-speed gearbox and a chain-driven transmission. Each car had a material and quality guarantee and the first car was produced at the end of March 1906, at a price of £650. Some 50 hands were employed during the first year and they produced about a dozen cars.

By 1908, 1,000 workers were at a factory, which covered ; a night shift was introduced to help create adequate supply to meet the rising demand for products. By September 1912, workshops covered more than 8 acres, output was running at 1,000 cars a year and employee numbers were 1,800. Austin built their own bodies and their coachbuilding department was one of the largest in the country. They built their own artillery wood wheels and made the hubs for wire-spoked and pressed-steel wheels. In February 1914, the company was floated as a public company and £250,000 of new preference shares were issued to the public and listed on the stock exchanges.

The new funding paid for the construction of additional workshops and the transition of the plant from mechanical drive with its great shafts and belts to electric drive. Two four-cylinder vertical gas engines of each, designed by the Anderson Foundry Co. of Glasgow, coupled to three-phase alternators built by Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget of Sweden, provided the electricity.

===World War I===
The Longbridge plant was part of a significant rapid mobilisation process, which took place across Europe on the outbreak of World War I. Machines that had been used to build Austin cars were employed to produce munitions, and all the resources of the factory were harnessed to serve the armed forces.

As the demand for weapons and equipment of every kind continued to increase, the factory was expanded. The area between the existing buildings and the Midland Railway mainline were built on. The expansion also enabled the 1915 construction of Longbridge railway station within the boundaries of the works, allowing the Midland Railway to run workers&#x27; trains direct from Birmingham New Street.

By 1917, the factory site trebled in size, and possessed its own flying ground at Cofton Hackett, south of the main works, which was operated by the newly formed &quot;Austin Aero Company&quot;. The employees, many of whom were women, rose to over 22,000 during the peak years.

Between 1914 and 1918, over 8,000,000 shells were produced along with 650 guns, 2,000 aeroplanes, 2,500 aero engines, and 2,000 trucks. In recognition of this, Herbert Austin was knighted in 1917 and he was also honoured by Belgium for employing 3,000 Belgian refugees at Longbridge.

====North works: 1917====
With the need to expand capacity, the company bought Longbridge farm. Located north of the existing site, it became known as Longbridge North works, bounded again by the railways, Bristol Road, and Longbridge Lane. After the farm buildings had been demolished and the River Rea placed in a covered culvert, the company began development in June 1916:
*Machine shop 850 ft × 270 ft finished by December 1916
*Forge which became operational in March 1917
*Mess room seating 4,000
*Administrative blocks
*Power house, equipped with 12 Lancashire boilers, which powered three 1500 kW turbo generators to supply 386 electric motors

====1919====
The works and plant had grown to over 10 times their prewar size; no peace-time products were being made. The Armistice terminated the war suddenly, contracts were cancelled at very short notice.

Major wartime additions to plant included a large steel foundry, a very large sheet-metal pressings shop, and a very large and complete hardening and heat-treatment shop.

=== The interwar years ===

Before the end of the war, plans were announced for concentrating on the production of a 20 hp car when peace returned. In addition, the engine used for the 20 hp model was adapted for an Austin tractor, running on kerosene, which won many agricultural awards between 1919 and 1921. A 13-ton truck was also produced, using the same engine.

For a short time Austin Aero Company&#x27;s postwar programme also included a range of aeroplanes. The Austin Greyhound two-seater fighter was one, and the Austin Ball single-seater another. Then, a single-seater biplane with folding wings was sold at £500, with a fourth called the Austin Whippet.

After 1921, Austin became interested in smaller vehicles, including a 12 hp car and the tiny, and still familiar, Austin 7. In many ways, the car was a miniature version, scaled down with the characteristic simplicity of Lord Austin&#x27;s products.

===World War II===

On the outbreak of World War II, the factory was mobilised again. The manufacturing of cars was largely abandoned and the machines were turned to the production of armour-piercing ammunition for the QF 2-pounder, QF 6-pounder, and QF 17-pounder antitank guns, steel boxes, jerrycans, mines, depth charges, and helmets.

Longbridge also produced parts for tanks, while aircraft were produced at the Austin Aero shadow factory at nearby Cofton Hackett. Fairey Battle light bombers and Mercury and Pegasus aero engines were produced, along with the Short Stirling four-engined heavy bomber and Hawker Hurricane fighter. Nearly 3,000 aircraft were built, along with 36,000 suspension units.

Bren guns and mortars were manufactured in West Works, in the area later known as West 4 Upper.

Trentham buildings, Number 2 paint shop, was still referred to as the Beaufighter line by some people during the 1970s.

The building known as the Flight Shed in Cofton Lane was where the airframes received their final quality check and wings were fitted to Hurricane fighters. Lancaster wings were fitted as the aircraft left the shed. Hurricanes were lifted up the raised airfield on a motorised skid. The skids were still there at the rear of the Flight Shed during the 1980s. Lancaster bombers were transported by road to RAF Elmdon for flight testing.

Having such a concentration of wartime production meant that the area was a prime target for bombers. Erdington was made famous for being the first part of England to be bombed by the Germans, who had presumably been trying to hit Longbridge.

=== After the war ===
After the war, Leonard Lord took over as chairman. He laid plans for a rapid expansion, new models, and overseas marketing. In June 1946, the millionth Austin was produced. It was painted in a matte cream and signed by the chairman and the workpeople at a special celebration.

Austin collaborated with Jensen Motors to manufacture the Austin A40 Sports, an aluminium-bodied, four-passenger convertible — with bodies manufactured by Jensen - not at their West Bromwich plant - but at another site in Pensnett, near Dudley - and transferred to Longbridge for final assembly. Later Austin collaborated with the Donald Healey Motor Company on the Healey 100.

In 1952, Austin was amalgamated with Morris Motors Limited and became BMC.

Harold Wilson&#x27;s government arranged for BMC to be amalgamated into British Leyland in 1968.

=== Nationalisation ===

The British Leyland company ran into financial difficulties and was refinanced by the government in 1975. The government thus became the dominant shareholder, but unlike most nationalised industries, British Leyland (later called BL) remained a public company.

Derek Robinson, or &quot;Red Robbo&quot; as he was dubbed by the media, became synonymous with the strikes that severely affected production at the Longbridge plant in Birmingham in the 1970s. Between 1978 and 1979, the then government-owned British Leyland attributed 523 disputes to Robinson, the factory convenor at Longbridge. However, Robinson&#x27;s responsibility for these incidents, most of which were brief stoppages led by individual shop stewards, has been overstated. He was eventually sacked amid intense press attacks. Many of the votes for strikes were cast in Cofton Park opposite Q-Gate.

Expansion work at Longbridge was completed in 1979 to allow a new assembly line for the forthcoming new supermini car, which was launched in 1980 as the Austin Metro. The Metro was in production virtually unchanged for 10 years, becoming one of the most popular cars ever to be produced at the plant. The major part of the expansion was the erection of &quot;New West Works&quot;, where the body shells were assembled, with extensive robotic input - a first for British Leyland. The shells were then carried on an enclosed conveyor over the Bristol Road to the Car Assembly Buildings in South Works, where the cars were assembled and tested. This arrangement endured until car production at Longbridge ceased in 2005. Indeed, the overhead conveyor bridge was one of the first features to go when demolition of the plant began.
=== Privatisation and subsequent liquidation ===

By the 1980s, BL had been severely rationalised, and many businesses and other factories within its empire had either been closed or sold off. It had also entered into a collaborative deal with Japanese firm Honda, which gave BL a new lease on life and Honda entry into the UK market.

The Austin Metro, which was introduced in 1980 and discontinued in 1990 when it was relaunched as an updated model under the Rover marque, was easily the most successful product to be produced at Longbridge in the final quarter of the 20th century.

In 1988, the Longbridge plant, along with the rest of Austin Rover, was sold to British Aerospace, which renamed it as the Rover Group in 1989.

In 1989, a new Longbridge-built model was launched, the second-generation Rover 200 (the original version had been launched in 1984). The 200 series was sold in the hatchback, coupe, and cabriolet body styles, and also formed the basis of the Rover 400 saloon and estate. It was consistently one of the most popular small family cars sold in Britain throughout its production life, and remained a common sight on British roads for many years after it ceased production. The 200 and 400 were replaced by all-new models in 1995, this time being completely separate model ranges, with the new Rover 400 being derived from the Honda Civic.
In 1994 BMW, fearful of their small size relative to their rivals in a progressively globalised car market, bought Rover Group and the Longbridge plant passed into the hands of BMW, but continuing heavy losses alarmed BMW shareholders, and in 2000, Rover Cars and the Longbridge factory were sold to the Phoenix Consortium, which renamed it MG Rover Group, in a management buyout for the token sum of £10.

At the time, many financial commentators claimed that the plant was not modern enough and that the company would surely run out of money within a few years. In April 2005, this happened; the Phoenix Consortium put the MG Rover group into administration, leaving more than 6,000 workers without jobs. Another factor in MG Rover&#x27;s meltdown was the fact that it had not launched an all-new model since the Rover 75 more than six years earlier. In contrast, the likes of Ford and Vauxhall, and indeed most other Western European mass-market carmakers, had replaced most if not all of their model ranges since the late 1990s.
=== Nanjing and SAIC ownership ===

Chinese automobile company Nanjing acquired the remaining assets of MG Rover, including the lease to the Longbridge plant, three months after it went into receivership. In August 2008, MG TF production restarted, some three years after the collapse of MG Rover, using only part of the old Austin works, Austin&#x27;s original South Works. Most of the rest of the site has since been demolished for redevelopment, including a new local centre, south of Longbridge Lane.

The scaled-down car plant at Longbridge had less production capacity than before. More than half the factory site was sold off and cleared, and the land restored to provide land for homes and businesses with a target of creating 10,000 jobs and 1,450 homes. 

Nanjing Automotive Corporation was acquired by Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) during late 2007 into 2008, resulting in the Longbridge site coming under the ownership of SAIC. The UK engineering function known as SAIC Motor Technical Centre UK (SMTC) was moved from its site in Leamington into the Longbridge during 2008. In 2010, the SMTC was unveiled showing the engineering areas and styling studio.

During this time, the engineers at Longbridge had worked on the MG 6, which was based on the Roewe 550 to make it ready for UK launch. MG Motors was created as the UK manufacturing company for SAIC, and in April 2011, began manufacturing the MG 6 from semiknocked-down (SKD) kits that come from the SAIC Lingang Plant China. The cars arrive from China, essentially complete, requiring only the fitting of engine and front suspension, nose trim, and wheels at Longbridge, which no longer has functional body welding/assembly or paint shops. Production of the MG TF was discontinued around this time, with a mere 906 having been built at Longbridge since production restarted almost three years previously. Production of the MG 3 supermini began at Longbridge in 2012, and by 2014, the plant employed around 400 workers, up from just over 200 people who were there when production restarted.

The new MG GS SUV was due to be launched in May 2016, and body kits were arriving in a readymade format. The rear suspension as found on the VW Tiguan was to be fitted in Longbridge, as well as the engine and UK-specification dashboard. Any factory extras such as HID headlights, would also be stored and fitted at the Longbridge plant. Various parts of the 4x4 system, including parts to the rear axle, would have been fitted in the UK.

On 23 September 2016, MG announced that all car production had ceased at Longbridge. Henceforth, all MG vehicles would be imported into the UK.

Starting on 19 January 2020, the last surviving assembly buildings CAB1 and CAB2, and the paint shop are to be mostly demolished to make way for further new housing, although parts of the buildings are to be retained. The former production facility will now only be used to sell cars and research and development of future models.

==Popular culture==
Shortly before MG Rover went into administration in 2005, The Chemical Brothers&#x27; video for their single &quot;Believe&quot; contained scenes filmed inside the Longbridge factory.

Also, images from the Longbridge production line and from the Mini were used to introduce the United Kingdom&#x27;s entry in the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest hosted at the city of Birmingham.

Several references to the Longbridge plant – where some characters work – are made in the novel &quot;The Rotters&#x27; Club&quot; and its sequels &quot;The Closed Circle&quot; and &quot;Middle England&quot; by Jonathan Coe.

<text>Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare medical conditions that result in easy blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. Blisters occur with minor trauma or friction and are painful. Its severity can range from mild to fatal. Inherited EB is a rare disease with a prevalence in the United States of 8.2 per million live births. Those with mild cases may not develop symptoms until they start to crawl or walk. Complications may include esophageal narrowing, squamous cell skin cancer, and the need for amputations.
EB is due to a mutation in at least one of 16 different genes. Some types are autosomal dominant while others are autosomal recessive. The underlying mechanism is a defect in attachment between or within the layers of the skin. Loss or diminished function of type VII collagen leads to weakness in the structural architecture of the dermal–epidermal junction (DEJ) and mucosal membranes. There are four main types: epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), and Kindler syndrome. The diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by skin biopsy or genetic testing.
There is no cure for the condition. Management involves wound care, pain control, controlling infections, nutritional support, and prevention and treatment of complications. About half a million people are affected globally. It occurs equally commonly in males and females.

==Classification==
Epidermolysis bullosa refers to a group of disorders that involve the formation of blisters following trivial trauma. Over 300 mutations have been identified in this condition. They have been classified into the following types:

===Epidermolysis bullosa simplex===
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is a form of EB that causes blisters at the site of rubbing. It typically affects the hands and feet, and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, affecting the keratin genes KRT5 and KRT14. Therefore, there is a failure in keratinization, which affects the integrity and the ability of the skin to resist mechanical stresses.

===Junctional epidermolysis bullosa===
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) is an inherited disease affecting laminin and collagen. This disease is characterized by blister formation within the lamina lucida of the basement membrane zone and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It also presents with blisters at the site of friction, especially on the hands and feet, and has variants that can occur in children and adults. Less than one person per million people is estimated to have this form of EB.

===Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa===
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is an inherited variant affecting the skin and other organs. DEB is caused by genetic defects (or mutations) within the human COL7A1 gene encoding the protein type VII collagen (collagen VII). DEB-causing mutations can be either autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa and albopapuloid epidermolysis bullosa (Pasini disease) are rare subtypes of this disease.

===Other genetic variants===

===Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita===
===Acral peeling===
==Pathophysiology==
The human skin consists of two layers: an outermost layer called the epidermis and a layer underneath called the dermis. In individuals with healthy skin, there are protein anchors between these two layers (dermo-epidermal junction) that prevent them from moving independently from one another (shearing). In people born with EB, the two skin layers lack the protein anchors that hold them together, resulting in extremely fragile skin—even minor mechanical friction (like rubbing or pressure) or trauma will separate the layers of the skin and form blisters and painful sores. EB individuals manifest unremitting skin blistering that evolves into chronic wounds, inflammation, and fibrosis. People with EB have compared the sores with third-degree burns. Furthermore, as a complication of the chronic skin damage, people with EB have an increased risk of malignancies (cancers) of the skin. Virtually any organ lined or covered by epithelium may be injured in inherited EB. External eye, esophagus, upper airway, and genitourinary tract are the epithelial surfaced tissues that are at particular risk.

==Diagnosis==
EB can be diagnosed either by a skin (punch) biopsy at the edge of a wound with immunofluorescent mapping, or via blood sample and genetic testing.

==Treatment==
Research has focused on changing the mixture of keratins produced in the skin. There are 54 known keratin genes—of which 28 belong to the type I intermediate filament genes and 26 to type II—which work as heterodimers. Many of these genes share substantial structural and functional similarity, but they are specialized to cell type and/or conditions under which they are normally produced. If the balance of production could be shifted away from the mutated, dysfunctional keratin gene toward an intact keratin gene, symptoms could be reduced. For example, sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, was found to reduce blistering in a mouse model to the point where affected pups could not be identified visually, when injected into pregnant mice (5 μmol/day = 0.9 mg) and applied topically to newborns (1 μmol/day = 0.2 mg in jojoba oil).

As of 2008, clinical research at the University of Minnesota has explored allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for RD and junctional EB, treating a two-year-old child who is one of two brothers with EB. A second transplant has also been performed on the child&#x27;s older brother. A Missouri boy has also successfully undergone the transplant, as well as a 5 year old boy from Alabama. So far there have been 12 successful transplants. Another transplant is scheduled for a California baby. A clinical trial is planned for 30 subjects. However, the immune suppression that bone marrow transplantation requires causes a risk of serious infections with large scale blisters and skin erosion. Indeed, at least four people have died in the course of either preparation for or institution of bone marrow transplantation for EB, out of only a small group of patients treated so far. The mechanism of action of this therapy is unclear as hematopoietic stem cells are not thought to contribute to epithelial lineages. Rather, it is speculated that cross-correction from tissue-resident graft-derived immune cells contributes to the observed clinical benefit.

A pilot study performed in 2015 suggests that systemic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may promote increased wound healing in people with dystrophic EB. Transplanting skin derived from genetically modified stem cells onto the wound surfaces has been studied with a report of improvements in one person.

A 2017 clinical trial with male RDEB (recessive dystrophic EB) patients conducted successful grafting of type VII gene corrected keratinocytes (COL7A1 gene correction using retrovirus transduction), without any serious adverse effects. Type VII collage formation was observed at the dermis-epidermis junction in significant amounts.

A 2020 study demonstrated the safe allogenic grafting of acellular dermal matrix/scaffolds in EB patients without any observed infection or necrosis and instead noted fewer required dressing changes, promoted wound healing, pain reduction, and an overall improvement in the quality of life of the patients.

In 2022, a pharmaceutical gel made out of birch bark extract from &quot;Betula pendula&quot; and &quot;Betula pubescens&quot; was approved by the European Union as a treatment for epidermolysis bullosa.

===Monitoring===
The Epidermolysis Bullosa Disease Activity and Scarring index (EBDASI) is a scoring system that objectively quantifies the severity of EB. The EBDASI is a tool for clinicians and patients to monitor the severity of the disease. It has also been designed to evaluate the response to new therapies for the treatment of EB. The EBDASI was developed and validated by Professor Dedee Murrell and her team of students and fellows at the St George Hospital, University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. It was presented at the International Investigative Dermatology congress in Edinburgh in 2013 and a paper-based version was published in the &quot;Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology&quot; in 2014.

==Prognosis==
A 2014 study classified cases into three types—EBS, JEB and DEB—and reviewed their times of death. The first two types tended to die in infancy and the last in early adulthood. In a survey of 11 families affected by the disease, lack of awareness of the disease by both the public and health care providers raised concerns about the care provided.

==Epidemiology==
An estimated 20 per million live births are diagnosed with EB, and 9 per million people in the general population have the condition. Of these cases, approximately 92% are EBS, 5% are DEB, 1% are JEB, and 2% are unclassified. Carrier frequency ranges from 1 in 333 for JEB, to 1 in 450 for DEB; the carrier frequency for EBS is presumed to be much higher than JEB or DEB.

The disorder occurs in every racial and ethnic group and affects both sexes.

==Society and culture==
In 2010, Emma Fogarty, a campaigner for DEBRA Ireland (the EB charity), was awarded a People of the Year Award. Actor Colin Farrell has campaigned with Fogarty on behalf of affected people.

In 2014, Pearl Jam lead vocalist Eddie Vedder together with his wife Jill McCormick co-founded the EB Research Partnership, a non-profit organization dedicated to finding a cure for EB. McCormick is childhood friends with Ryan Fullmer, whose son, Michael, was born with EB. Vedder, McCormick, Ryan Fullmer, and his wife Heather founded Heal EB. In 2014, they merged Heal EB with the Jackson Gabriel Research Foundation to create the EB Research Partnership. The EBRP hosts several annual fundraising events. To date, they have raised $12 million to fund research to find a cure.

On 1 March 2019, heavyweight boxer Luis Ortiz was named an honorary ambassador for the EB community by the EB Research Partnership. Ortiz&#x27;s daughter, Lismercedes, was born with EB.

===Television===
The condition was brought to public attention in 2004 in the UK through the Channel 4 documentary &quot;The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off&quot;, chronicling the life and death of Jonny Kennedy, an Englishman with EB. In the United States, HBO ran a documentary, &quot;My Flesh and Blood&quot;, in 2003. Additionally, the film &quot;Butterfly Girl&quot; follows Abigail Evans with the disease. In Canada, The Sports Network&#x27;s award-winning documentary on Jonathan Pitre led to extensive coverage on the boy&#x27;s disease, treatment, and death.

===Other names===
Other terms used to describe those affected include &quot;butterfly children&quot; as the skin is fragile as a butterfly&#x27;s wings, &quot;cotton wool babies&quot;, or &quot;crystal skin children&quot;.

<doc id="663203" wikidata="Q4800823" url="?curid=663203" title="Arthur–Merlin protocol">
<text>In computational complexity theory, an Arthur–Merlin protocol, introduced by , is an interactive proof system in which the verifier&#x27;s coin tosses are constrained to be public (i.e. known to the prover too). proved that all (formal) languages with interactive proofs of arbitrary length with private coins also have interactive proofs with public coins.

Given two participants in the protocol called Arthur and Merlin respectively, the basic assumption is that Arthur is a standard computer (or verifier) equipped with a random number generating device, while Merlin is effectively an oracle with infinite computational power (also known as a prover). However, Merlin is not necessarily honest, so Arthur must analyze the information provided by Merlin in response to Arthur&#x27;s queries and decide the problem itself. A problem is considered to be solvable by this protocol if whenever the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, Merlin has some series of responses which will cause Arthur to accept at least of the time, and if whenever the answer is &quot;no&quot;, Arthur will never accept more than of the time. Thus, Arthur acts as a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier, assuming it is allotted polynomial time to make its decisions and queries.

==MA==
The simplest such protocol is the 1-message protocol where Merlin sends Arthur a message, and then Arthur decides whether to accept or not by running a probabilistic polynomial time computation. (This is similar to the verifier-based definition of NP, the only difference being that Arthur is allowed to use randomness here.) Merlin does not have access to Arthur&#x27;s coin tosses in this protocol, since it is a single-message protocol and Arthur tosses his coins only after receiving Merlin&#x27;s message. This protocol is called &quot;MA&quot;. Informally, a language &quot;L&quot; is in MA if for all strings in the language, there is a polynomial sized proof that Merlin can send Arthur to convince him of this fact with high probability, and for all strings not in the language there is no proof that convinces Arthur with high probability.

Formally, the complexity class MA is the set of decision problems that can be decided in polynomial time by an Arthur–Merlin protocol where Merlin&#x27;s only move precedes any computation by Arthur. In other words, a language &quot;L&quot; is in MA if there exists a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot; and polynomials &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; such that for every input string &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;n&quot; = |&quot;x&quot;|,
*if &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_1
*if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_2

The second condition can alternatively be written as
*if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_3

To compare this with the informal definition above, &quot;z&quot; is the purported proof from Merlin (whose size is bounded by a polynomial) and &quot;y&quot; is the random string that Arthur uses, which is also polynomially bounded.

==AM==
The complexity class AM (or AM[2]) is the set of decision problems that can be decided in polynomial time by an Arthur–Merlin protocol with two messages. There is only one query/response pair: Arthur tosses some random coins and sends the outcome of &quot;all&quot; his coin tosses to Merlin, Merlin responds with a purported proof, and Arthur deterministically verifies the proof. In this protocol, Arthur is only allowed to send outcomes of coin tosses to Merlin, and in the final stage Arthur must decide whether to accept or reject using only his previously generated random coin flips and Merlin&#x27;s message.

In other words, a language &quot;L&quot; is in AM if there exists a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine &quot;M&quot; and polynomials &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; such that for every input string &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;n&quot; = |&quot;x&quot;|,
*if &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_4
*if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_5

The second condition here can be rewritten as 
*if &quot;x&quot; is not in &quot;L&quot;, then formula_6

As above, &quot;z&quot; is the alleged proof from Merlin (whose size is bounded by a polynomial) and &quot;y&quot; is the random string that Arthur uses, which is also polynomially bounded.

The complexity class AM[&quot;k&quot;] is the set of problems that can be decided in polynomial time, with &quot;k&quot; queries and responses. AM as defined above is AM[2]. AM[3] would start with one message from Merlin to Arthur, then a message from Arthur to Merlin and then finally a message from Merlin to Arthur. The last message should always be from Merlin to Arthur, since it never helps for Arthur to send a message to Merlin after deciding his answer.

==Properties==

* Both MA and AM remain unchanged if their definitions are changed to require perfect completeness, which means that Arthur accepts with probability 1 (instead of 2/3) when &quot;x&quot; is in the language.
* For any constant &quot;k&quot; ≥ 2, the class AM[&quot;k&quot;] is equal to AM[2]. If &quot;k&quot; can be polynomially related to the input size, the class AM[poly(&quot;n&quot;)] is equal to the class, IP, which is known to be equal to PSPACE and is widely believed to be stronger than the class AM[2].
* MA is contained in AM, since AM[3] contains MA: Arthur can, after receiving Merlin&#x27;s certificate, flip the required number of coins, send them to Merlin, and ignore the response.
* It is open whether AM and MA are different. Under plausible circuit lower bounds (similar to those implying P=BPP), they are both equal to NP.
* AM is the same as the class BP⋅NP where BP denotes the bounded-error probabilistic operator. Also, formula_7 ( also written as ExistsBPP) is a subset of MA. Whether MA is equal to formula_7 is an open question.
* The conversion to a private coin protocol, in which Merlin cannot predict the outcome of Arthur&#x27;s random decisions, will increase the number of rounds of interaction by at most 2 in the general case. So the private-coin version of AM is equal to the public-coin version.
* MA contains both NP and BPP. For BPP this is immediate, since Arthur can simply ignore Merlin and solve the problem directly; for NP, Merlin need only send Arthur a certificate, which Arthur can validate deterministically in polynomial time.
* Both MA and AM are contained in the polynomial hierarchy. In particular, MA is contained in the intersection of Σ2P and Π2P and AM is contained in Π2P. Even more, MA is contained in subclass , a complexity class expressing &quot;symmetric alternation&quot;. This is a generalization of Sipser–Lautemann theorem.
* AM is contained in NP/poly, the class of decision problems computable in non-deterministic polynomial time with a polynomial size advice. The proof is a variation of Adleman&#x27;s theorem.
* MA is contained in PP; this result is due to Vereshchagin.
* MA is contained in its quantum version, QMA.
* AM contains the problem of deciding if two graphs are &quot;not&quot; isomorphic. The protocol using private coins is the following and can be transformed to a public coin protocol. Given two graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, Arthur randomly chooses one of them, and chooses a random permutation of its vertices, presenting the permuted graph &quot;I&quot; to Merlin. Merlin has to answer if &quot;I&quot; was created from &quot;G&quot; or &quot;H&quot;. If the graphs are nonisomorphic, Merlin will be able to answer with full certainty (by checking if &quot;I&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;G&quot;). However, if the graphs are isomorphic, it is both possible that &quot;G&quot; or &quot;H&quot; was used to create &quot;I&quot;, and equally likely. In this case, Merlin has no way to tell them apart and can convince Arthur with probability at most 1/2, and this can be amplified to 1/4 by repetition. This is in fact a zero knowledge proof.
* If AM contains coNP then PH = AM. This is evidence that graph isomorphism is unlikely to be NP-complete, since it implies collapse of polynomial hierarchy.
* It is known, assuming ERH, that for any &quot;d&quot; the problem &quot;Given a collection of multivariate polynomials formula_9 each with integer coefficients and of degree at most &quot;d&quot;, do they have a common complex zero?&quot; is in AM.

<text>Erdington is a suburb and ward of Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England. Historically part of Warwickshire, it is located northeast of central Birmingham, bordering Sutton Coldfield. It was also a council constituency, managed by its own district committee. The former council district consisted of the ward of Erdington as well as Tyburn (formerly Kingsbury), Stockland Green and Kingstanding, although all of Kingstanding and most of both Tyburn and Stockland Green wards lie outside the historical boundaries of Erdington. Stockland Green was formerly part of Aston, Kingstanding part of Perry Barr, and Tyburn (Tyburn Road South &amp; Birches Green) partially split between Aston and Hodge Hill (Castle Vale). Erdington (ward) was part of the Sutton Coldfield constituency before 1974.

==History==

===Erdington Manor===
Erdington had its own manor house, Erdington Hall, which was protected on three sides by a double moat and on the fourth by the River Tame. It had developed from a small fortified homestead constructed by an Anglo-Saxon named Eardwulf in the area of Bromford. Demolished in the 17th century, it stood on a hill at the junction of what is now Wheelwright Road and Tyburn Road. The double moat was drained in the 18th century by Sir Charles Holte. Until 1912 another building stood, but this was demolished for the construction of the Tyburn Road, though a small section remained until World War I.

Other moated properties included one at Fern Road, one at the junction of Moor End Lane and Berkswell Road, and another that surrounded a large farm called Pipe Orchard, the site of which can be seen in the Erdington Grammar School playing fields.

===Middle Ages===
Erdington developed as a village as a result of settlers travelling up the course of the River Tame from Tamworth in the 9th century. The settlements of Minworth and Curdworth were also established. It is believed that the Roman track &#x27;Ridgeway&#x27;, now Chester Road, was another route for settlers, since the early nucleus of the village which was a very short distance from the path.

At the time of the Norman conquest the Earls of Mercia had possession of the village: Edwin, grandson of Lady Godiva, owned the property. He tried to resist the Normans&#x27; attempts to gain possession of Erdington, but he was executed in 1071. The earldom then passed to William I who placed the manor and village in the possession of William Fitz-Ansculf, a powerful Norman baron who lived at Dudley Castle. He then gave the manor to Peter de Erdington.

Erdington was mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name Hardintone and was under the possession of Peter. It had arable land for six ploughs, a mill and of meadows and woodland. It was valued at 30 shillings and was one mile (1.6 km) in length and half a mile in breadth.

As Erdington was near Sutton Forest, the Normans imposed strict laws on the village forbidding the hunting of wild animals and the keeping of sheep. Tenants were permitted an allowance of timber from the forest, but with limitations to protect royal game. Erdington remained within the precincts of Sutton Forest until 1126, when Henry I exchanged the Manor of Sutton, with forest, for two manors in Rutland belonging to Roger, Earl of Warwick. The forest became a chase and the woodland laws were relaxed.

The mill mentioned in the Domesday Book was located in Bromford, close to the manor house at a loop in the river, where a straight channel was cut to facilitate the milling of corn. The mill was owned by the lord of the manor and the tenants were obliged to grind their corn there. Erdington was connected to Bromford via Bromford Lane, which still exists today in the middle of a 1960s council estate.

In the 15th century, a chapel was built at the side of the manor house for the residents of Erdington. However, attendance was low and the chapel fell into decay. The residents were then urged to travel to the parish church in Aston; however, again the attendance was low. A south aisle was therefore added to the church and became known as the Erdington chantry.

The Black plague affected Erdington severely as indicated in the 14th century local records. Henry de Pipe, owner of the Manor of Pipe (now Pype Hayes Hall), lost his wife and all but one child. His second wife, Maud, was the daughter of George de Castello of Castle Bromwich. However he soon discovered that she was pregnant with a child of another man, and he then died.

===Tudor period===
Around the 1500s the Gravelly Hill area began to become mentioned in documents. John Leland described the area as &quot;by sandy ground, better wooded than fertile of wheat ... the soil is sandy and good for conyes.&quot; Thus there were many rabbits (conyes) and it is known that it remained as a rabbit warren for a while, as it was deemed unsuitable for cultivation. At the foot of Gravelly Hill was the River Tame, which was spanned by Salford Bridge. Salford Bridge was first mentioned as Shrafford Brugge during the reign of Henry III. It was originally a footbridge; however in 1810 it was improved to allow the crossing of vehicles. The word Shrafford was of Saxon origin, meaning &quot;the ford by the caves&quot;. These caves were cavities in the nearby Copeley escarpment. The caves were artificially enlarged, and survived World War II. During the war, they were used as air raid shelters. After the war they were completely destroyed for the construction of the Gravelly Hill Interchange.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, new families lived at Erdington Hall. The Dymocks moved in: they were a prominent family, including several knights. However their strict manorial laws made them unpopular amongst the residents of Erdington.

===English Civil War===
As the English Civil War erupted, Erdington was expanding rapidly through the purchase of land for agricultural purposes. In 1643, Birmingham was plundered by the Royalists. After his victory in Birmingham, Prince Rupert passed through Erdington and Sutton Coldfield with his troops on their way to Lichfield.

===18th and 19th centuries===

In 1759, a turnpike act was passed for the Chester Road and another act was passed in 1807 for a road that passed through Erdington village from Birmingham. This resulted in Erdington being a stop-off location for stage coaches which passed along the Chester Road to Chester from London. In 1783, the Birmingham-Fazeley Canal was completed. It passed along the southern boundary of Erdington at Tyburn. Planning requests included that the canal should not pass within 500 metres of Pype Hayes Hall.

By the mid-1700s, Erdington had a population of under 700 and within its boundaries were 52 roads, one forge, 40 farms, 96 cottages, two smithies and a shop. By 1832, it had a population of 2,000.

Erdington has had historic ties with both Castle Bromwich and Water Orton through administration, governance and land ownership whilst being part of Aston parish. Erdington was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Aston, In 1894 Erdington broke from Aston to become an urban district. Administrative offices were established at Rookery House on Kingsbury Road, which now forms part of Rookery Park. On 31 December 1894 Erdington became a separate civil parish, On 9 November 1911, the urban district Erdington and that of Aston Manor were absorbed into the County Borough of Birmingham. On 1 April 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham.

Erdington shopping centre formed the core of the area with most of the older housing being located close to it. The railway alongside also attracted the development of many Victorian and Edwardian houses.

===Highcroft Hospital===
Highcroft Hospital was a former Poor Law institution, and then a psychiatric hospital. There was a social stigma to being treated there. Other large psychiatric institutions in Birmingham have been broken up. Some of the old Highcroft Hospital grounds have been used for new housing. The main hospital building has been renovated into luxury apartments and has been named Highcroft Hall. Highcroft Hall was built between 1869 and 1871 by Victorian architect Yeoville Thomason.

The building, sanctioned by the Poor Law Board, was originally a workhouse providing housing to paupers, idiots, tramps, seniles, lunatics and imbeciles (terms used at the time with distinctive definitions).

The building was originally named the Aston Union Workhouse, but was renamed over the years as &quot;Erdington House&quot; (1912 – following the City boundary changes), and then &quot;Highcroft Hall Hospital&quot; (1942); and was more commonly referred to in later years as just &quot;Highcroft Hospital&quot;.

Over the years, the hospital has generally provided care for the mentally ill. In 1994, the hospital became part of the Northern Birmingham Mental Health NHS Trust. During the following two years, the facilities in the old buildings were gradually rehoused in more modern units nearby and in 1996, the main building was declared closed. The main house was derelict for the next eight years, before being refurbished by property developers between 2004 and 2006.

===Lyndhurst estate===
On the Sutton Road, a number of houses were demolished in 1957 for the construction of the Lyndhurst Estate. Number 44 was retained as it was an old building considered to be of interest. The demolished houses were detached post-1840 Victorian villas. Constructed on the site were six tower blocks and numerous low rise maisonettes. The tallest of these, Harlech Tower, was 16 storeys and at the time it was the tallest tower block in Birmingham, though many taller blocks were later built. In 1961, the estate won the Civic Award for Housing for the retention of the original trees from the villas and the architectural qualities of the tower blocks which included an exposed concrete frame, a sweeping staircase and a false upper storey to hide the laundry facilities on the roof.

The Lyndhurst estate has since been redeveloped. The low rise maisonettes were demolished along with Harlech and Burcombe Towers. Modern residential properties were built on the site and the remaining tower blocks refurbished.

===Pitts Farm estate===
Pitts Farm estate is off Chester Rd in some places bordering Pype Hayes Park. There are plans to develop and improve the area.

==Etymology==
Though referred to as &quot;Hardintone&quot; in the Domesday Book, it is widely accepted that the name comes from a reference to a fortified homestead established by Eardwulf in Anglo Saxon times, with &#x27;ton&#x27; or &#x27;tun&#x27; being an Anglo-Saxon suffix for a settlement of that period. This homestead developed into a large house in the area of Bromford and became Erdington Hall.

However the name &quot;&quot;Yenton&quot; also applies to the possible corruption of &quot;Yerdington&quot;&quot;, an enclosure, which could apply to a moated homestead.

==Features==
Erdington&#x27;s history is documented well through its buildings. One of the most well-known features in the area is Spaghetti Junction, situated on the southern edge of the district and on the border of Aston and Gravelly Hill. As well as being a road interchange, two railway lines, three canals, and two rivers also converge on that location. Britain&#x27;s longest bridge, Bromford Viaduct starts here, carrying the M6 to Junction 5, Castle Bromwich. It has long been a historic crossing point in Birmingham, with the incorporation of Salford Bridge, which was first mentioned in a deed in 1490, although a bridge is believed to have been at this location since 1290.

===Fort Dunlop===
Nearby is Fort Dunlop, former home of Dunlop Rubber, a relic of Erdington&#x27;s industrial past. At its peak, it employed 10,000 people but its industrial usage has declined since, with Dunlop maintaining only a small presence in the area. The factory closed in September 2014.

The main building was redeveloped from 2005 to 2006 into office and retail space by Urban Splash. The area surrounding Fort Dunlop is used by logistics companies and also features showrooms operated by several car manufacturers, including Birmingham&#x27;s only Lamborghini dealership.

===Shopping===
Fort Dunlop lends its name to the nearby The Fort Shopping Park, constructed on reclaimed land by the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation in 1996.

Erdington has a distinct concentration of retail space, known as Erdington town centre or Erdington village, the main focus of which is Erdington High Street. There is also a market located on Barnabas Road and another market, Wilton Market, between Sutton New Road and the High Street, next to Wilton Market is Swannies which is intermediate between a market and a shopping centre. Opposite Wilton Market and Swannies on the High Street is a Cooperative Store which has been there since at least the 1950s and is the largest Supermarket in the town centre. Erdington town centre is now a Business Improvement District.

===Other features in central Erdington===

Also on the High Street is Erdington Parish Church, and nearby on Sutton Road is The Abbey Church. The original Abbey building forms part of the neighbouring Highclare School. The Parish Church was severely damaged by fire on the morning of 4 October 2007. It has now been extensively repaired and modernised. Also nearby, on Mason Road, is Erdington Swimming Baths which were constructed by the Birmingham Baths Committee, this was a complex including Saunas and a fitness centre as well as a swimming pool, but has now been replaced by a new leisure Centre and Baths on Orphanage Road nearby. Erdington Library, Opened in 1907 as a Carnegie library, is a public library operated by Birmingham City Council. It is the meeting place of the Erdington Historical Society on the second Monday of every month.

===Other features in Erdington===
Schools

Josiah Mason Campus, a campus forming Birmingham Metropolitan College, was formerly a further education college by the name of Josiah Mason College that merged with Sutton Coldfield College in 2006. Before the site was taken over by Josiah Mason, there were two grammar schools and a further secondary school. The two grammar schools were Marsh Hill Boys School and Marsh Hill Girls Schools (the schools were formally known as Grammar Technical Schools); the third school on the site was Stockland Green Bilateral School.

Other secondary schools in Erdington were: Erdington Girls Grammar School, Jaffray School, Moor End School and St Edmond Campion School which were &quot;fed&quot; by children leaving Primary Schools at Erdington Hall and others(list needs completing).

Community Facilities

To the north of Erdington, within the area of Pype Hayes on the border with Walmley, is Pype Hayes Park and Pype Hayes Hall, the former home of the Bagot family. A smaller park in the area is Sorrel Park.

The &quot;Old Green Man&quot; on Bromford Lane (now known as the &quot;Lad in the Lane&quot;) is one of the oldest public houses in Birmingham. Another, is the &#x27;Charlie Hall&#x27;, in Ward End. It&#x27;s named after the Birmingham character actor who starred in many Laurel and Hardy films.

In 2017, a brand new sports facility opened to the public. It cost £7.5 million and provided the people of Erdington with a 25-metre swimming pool, a teaching pool, a 70-station gym and a community room/studio space. Fitness classes, children holiday activity area and birthday parties are also hosted there.

===Hospitals===
Erdington is served by the Good Hope Hospital in neighbouring Sutton Coldfield. Erdington is also served by the Birmingham Hospice and by Northcroft Hospital built on the edge of the site of the former Highcroft Hospital.

==Geography==
Erdington itself borders the traditionally working class areas of Aston, Perry Barr and Hodge Hill as well as Kingstanding, Tyburn, and Stockland Green and the affluent, spacious districts of Sutton Coldfield, Minworth, Castle Bromwich and Water Orton (North Warwickshire). The area is also close to both Lichfield and Tamworth in Staffordshire. It is located approximately north east of Birmingham City Centre.

The borders of Erdington are:
* Boldmere via the Chester Road
* Stockland Green which borders with Witton at the end of Marsh Hill (with Wyrley Birch part of Kingstanding (ward))
* The Yenton and Chester Road form the border from Wylde Green
* Following Chester Road down all the way to the Tyburn House Public House would end the Erdington constituency as Castle Vale (formerly Castle Bromwich and the Aerodrome) is further down
* New Oscott past Oscott College
* Walmley (Eachelhurst Road)
* Moving back would be the Tyburn road which intersects Kingsbury Road and leads right back to Spaghetti junction on the border of Aston &amp; Gravelly Hill.
* Birches Green and Tyburn Road.
* Minworth and Curdworth at the North Eastern end of Kingsbury Road heading towards Kingsbury Village and the Warwickshire border.

Erdington also includes Pype Hayes. This was formerly a working class area of Council houses built between World War I and World War II. These houses had to be demolished due to problems with the concrete used in their construction. Pype Hayes is now an area with modern houses, some are owner occupied, others belong to Housing associations. One tower block, Sorrel House, was retained and refurbished.

Brookvale Park Lake and surrounding land is a park that was formally a drinking water reservoir until the steadily encroaching city made the water unfit for human consumption. It was briefly converted into an outdoor pool until that was also abandoned after health and safety concerns.

Two tornadoes touched down in Birmingham on 23 November 1981 as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The first tornado, rated as an F1/T2 tornado, touched down in Erdington at about 14:00 local time, causing some damage across the northern suburbs of Birmingham.

<text>Mainframe Studios is a Canadian animation studio owned by Wow Unlimited Media and based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Founded in 1993 as Mainframe Entertainment Inc. by Christopher Brough, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell, Gavin Blair and John Grace, the company established itself as a leading contributor to the introduction of computer-generated imagery (CGI) live action in animation, film and television.

The company previously operated as a subsidiary of Starz Inc. (at the time a division of IDT Corporation) between 2003 and 2007. Local post production firm, Rainmaker Income Fund, acquired a majority stake in the company, initially rebranding it in the process as Rainmaker Animation and would fold into it in 2008, permanently rebranding it as Rainmaker Entertainment. Rainmaker would revive the &quot;Mainframe Entertainment&quot; name for its then-newly-created division meant for television production. On October 25, 2016, the company announced a triple acquisition and merger of Frederator Networks and Ezrin-Hirsh Entertainment to create the holding company, WOW! Unlimited Media, and rebrand a second time to Rainmaker Studios. In 2020, the company would rebrand a third and final time to Mainframe Studios to return to their &quot;Mainframe Entertainment&quot; name roots.

The company is best known for the production of the first fully computer-animated half-hour television series &quot;ReBoot&quot;; &quot;Beast Wars&quot;, a reimagined relaunch of &quot;Transformers&quot; from Hasbro; and &quot;Barbie&quot; since 2001, in partnership with American toy company Mattel — the majority of films which later expanded into other audiovisual media to create a multimedia franchise for the flagship fashion doll property.

==History==
===As Mainframe Entertainment===
The company was established in 1993 as Mainframe Entertainment Inc. by Christopher Brough, a noted Los Angeles-based animation producer and a British animation team known as &quot;The Hub&quot; – Gavin Blair, Ian Pearson, Phil Mitchell and John Grace. They were looking to create &quot;ReBoot&quot;, the first fully computer-animated television series, after having used the technology to produce music videos like &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Rocked&quot;. Due to the cost of shipping equipment back home, advantageous tax credits and proximity to Los Angeles, the company set up shop in Vancouver, Canada.

In 1994, &quot;ReBoot&quot; launched on ABC in the United States and YTV in Canada. The series intermittently ran for four seasons with production ending in 2001. The company&#x27;s second project was produced for American toy company Hasbro. &quot;Beast Wars&quot; (known in Canada as &quot;Beasties&quot;), a relaunch of the Transformers brand, debuted in 1996 and concluded in 1999. A follow-up, &quot;Beast Machines&quot; was produced between 1999 and 2000. Both &quot;ReBoot&quot; and &quot;Beast Wars&quot; were produced with Alliance Communications, who had taken a 50% ownership of Mainframe. In 1996, Mainframe paid $17 million to reduce Alliance&#x27;s share to 15%.

Mainframe became a publicly traded company with a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange on June 17, 1997. In conjunction with the public offering, Alliance sold 700,000 shares in the company, lowering their ownership to 7.8%. Christopher Brough became the CEO, Pearson the president, Blair as director of operations and Mitchell as Blair&#x27;s assistant/vice. In its first year on the stock exchange, Mainframe posted an $11 million loss despite producing hit multi-award-winning computer-animated shows during this period.

Mainframe opened its American division in Los Angeles on April 17, 1998, to be led by Dan DiDio and oversee content development, production and local distribution. DiDio previously worked with Mainframe through his stint as executive director of children&#x27;s programming at ABC.

After having earlier produced two &quot;ReBoot&quot; themed rides for the company, the IMAX Corporation made a $16 million investment in the company in 1999, which gave IMAX roughly 30% ownership of Mainframe, included the creation of a new joint venture meant to facilitate the creation of animated films based on &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; and &quot;Pied Piper&quot;, with a third project titled &quot;Pandora’s Box.&quot; The films were intended to be stereoscopic, 3D feature length releases, though none of the three saw completion.

At the end of the 1999 fiscal year, the company reported a $17 million loss. Thanks to episode deliveries for &quot;Beast Machines&quot;, &quot;Beast Wars&quot;, &quot;Shadow Raiders&quot; and &quot;Weird-Oh&#x27;s&quot; the company posted its first profit of $1.4 million in fiscal 2000. Buoyed by &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;, &quot;Action Man&quot; and their first direct-to-video film, &quot;Casper&#x27;s Haunted Christmas&quot;, Mainframe posted another profit of $2.4 million for fiscal 2001. Despite the success, the company faced a major management shakeup that year. Pearson had stepped down as president in June and left the company shortly after, with fellow co-founders Blair and Mitchell also leaving in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

In 2001, American toy maker Mattel partnered with Mainframe to produce &quot;Barbie in the Nutcracker&quot;. The direct-to-video feature sold more than million units in its first year. The success of the release led to a longstanding relationship between Mattel and the animation studio. Mainframe (and its successors) would later produce the majority of the franchise&#x27;s direct-to-video films, as well as a television series.

Following financial losses of $18.9 million and $7.5 million in fiscal 2002 and 2003, the American IDT Corporation announced it would purchase 56% of Mainframe for $14 million on September 16, 2003. After the cancellation of &quot;Spider-Man: The New Animated Series&quot; that same year, the company moved away from producing television series. While a number of projects were announced they ultimately did not see fruition, including a pre-school oriented &quot;ReBoot&quot; spinoff called &quot;Binomes&quot; as well as Mainframe&#x27;s first live-action production, an adaptation of &quot;Harriet the Spy&quot;. In 2005, the company acquired the distribution rights to the live-action/CGI-animated television series &quot;Zixx&quot;. Mainframe also provided animation for the show&#x27;s second and third seasons in conjunction with Thunderbird Films. The bulk of the company&#x27;s work now consisted of direct-to-video projects and television specials.

After producing the visuals for the 2003 MTV Movie Awards, Mainframe started a creative services division to produce video game animation, graphic design, motion graphics, titling, show opening sequences and branding in 2005. This branch of the company worked on a number of projects, including cut-scenes for &quot;Prototype&quot;, &quot;50 Cent: Blood on the Sand&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as the 2006 MTV Movie Awards.

===As Rainmaker===

Finding itself under new ownership, IDT sold its 62% stake in Mainframe to Vancouver-based post-production firm Rainmaker Income Fund on July 20, 2006, for $13.8 million. The next month Rainmaker announced it would acquire the remaining 38% of Mainframe. On January 30, 2007, Mainframe was renamed to Rainmaker Animation. Later that year, Rainmaker sold its visual effects and post production divisions to Deluxe Entertainment Services Group, leaving only the animation business.

In June 2012, Chinese animation studio Xing Xing Digital announced its intent to purchase Rainmaker, with the company willing to pay off Rainmaker&#x27;s $7 million debt. The purchase was called off after Rainmaker and Xing Xing were unable to finalize the sale by September 14, 2012.

In 2013, Rainmaker completed its first theatrical feature film, &quot;Escape from Planet Earth&quot;. Directed by Cal Brunker, it received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, grossing around $75 million worldwide. On October 7 that same year, Rainmaker launched a television production division and revived the &quot;Mainframe Entertainment&quot; brand for its title, starting with a CG-animated incarnation of &quot;Bob the Builder&quot;.

Rainmaker released its second theatrical feature film, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot; based on the video game series of the same name by Insomniac Games, in the first quarter of 2016 to financial failure. This poor reception to the film caused Rainmaker to take a $10 million impairment charge on their investment in the production and was later cited as the reason the company abandoned plans to adapt the &quot;Sly Cooper&quot; video game franchise into a theatrical film.

Later that year on October 25, Rainmaker announced their intent to acquire and merge Erzin-Hirsh Entertainment and American-based Frederator Networks (and its main division, Frederator Studios) and consolidate them under its then-new holding company, WOW! Unlimited Media Inc.(TSX:WOW.A) At that time, the company changed the names of its home-base divisions to Rainmaker Studios and Mainframe Studios. Since the reorganization, the company has been heavily involved in television production animating &quot;&quot;, a live-action/CGI-animated re-imagining of the &quot;ReBoot&quot; brand, &quot;Barbie: Dreamhouse Adventures&quot;, the first-ever full-length TV series in the &quot;Barbie&quot; media franchise and &quot;Spy Kids: Mission Critical&quot;, the animated reboot/spin-off of the Spy Kids (franchise) in 2018. In 2019, the studio released its first traditionally-animated production, a pilot based on Knowledge Network mascots made in Toon Boom Harmony.

===As Mainframe Studios===
On March 16, 2020, the studio announced it would be rebranding as Mainframe Studios and consolidate Rainmaker Studios under the &quot;Mainframe&quot; branding and fully returning the studio to their original &quot;Mainframe&quot; name. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mainframe Studios initiated remote work measures for its employees.

On June 24, 2021, the company confirmed that it would develop a 2D-animation pipeline in support of its first production in the medium, an animated series inspired by YouTube personality Guava Juice. The following August, Mainframe announced that it would open a virtual studio in Toronto in the east of the country, building upon its earlier remote work experience.

<text>Perry Barr is a suburban area in north Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It is also the name of a council constituency, managed by its own district committee. Birmingham Perry Barr is also a parliamentary constituency; its Member of Parliament between 2001 and 2024 was Labour&#x27;s Khalid Mahmood. The MP as of July 2024 is Ayoub Khan, who ran as an Independent. 

The constituency includes the smaller Perry Barr ward, and the wards of Handsworth Wood, Lozells and East Handsworth, and Oscott, which each elect three councillors to Birmingham City Council.

==Etymology==
There were four ancient manors in this area (all part of the parish of Handsworth) called Hamstead, Oscott, Perry, and Little (or Parva) Barr. Perry is the area around the parish church and this name is seen on maps but now seldom used. Over time, through confusion or convenience, the whole district came to be known as Perry Barr. &quot;Perry&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;pirige&quot;, meaning &quot;pear tree&quot;. The derivation of &quot;Barr&quot; is Old Celtic &quot;barro&quot; meaning &quot;hill top&quot;. Barr Beacon, the area&#x27;s highest hill, is in neighbouring Great Barr.

==History==
Perry Barr was originally two separate entities, both mentioned in the Domesday Book as &#x27;Pirio&#x27; and &#x27;Barre&#x27;. Pirio is recorded as having an estimated population of 35 and Barre with an estimated population of 25. William Fitz-Ansculf is recorded as being the tenant in chief of both manors, and Drogo as the tenant. It is thought that the two manors may have been combined in the Early Middle Ages.

In 1874, Perry Barr established its own institute based on the model of the Birmingham and Midland Institute.. In 1878, Henry Irving became the president of the Perry Barr Institute and addressed members of the institute on 6 March 1878. His speech was reprinted in the 13 March release of &quot;Theatre&quot; and also reprinted onto pamphlets by the institute&#x27;s members and sold for sixpence to fund the construction of a new building for the institute. It was converted into a Carnegie-funded library in September 1897. In early 2007, this library, ultimately known as Birchfield Community Library, was demolished due to its dilapidated condition. Another library in the area is Tower Hill Library.

Aston Villa opened their Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr in 1876, playing there until 1897.

Perry Barr was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Handsworth, on 26 March 1894 Perry Barr became a separate civil parish. Perry Barr Urban District was an urban district in Staffordshire from 1894 until 1928, when it was largely incorporated into Birmingham and thus also Warwickshire (this included an area which is now considered part of Great Barr). On 1 October 1930 the parish was abolished and merged with Birmingham. In 1921 the parish had a population of 2700. It then became part of the West Midlands in 1974 when Birmingham became a metropolitan borough in the county.

In 1903, Birmingham Crematorium, the City&#x27;s first, was opened by Sir Henry Thompson, president of the Cremation Society, in Perry Barr at 389 Walsall Road. It has been privately owned, currently by Dignity plc.

In the 1920s, Oscar Deutsch opened his first ever Odeon cinema here. The original cinema is now a conference venue, having also been a bingo hall. The 1920s Perry Barr Stadium on the Aldridge Road hosts greyhound racing and the Birmingham Brummies speedway team. It has a 500-seat capacity, and was refurbished in 2004. It is the former home of the Birchfield Harriers, whose Art Deco-styled bas relief badge it still carries. The Harriers now operate from nearby Alexander Stadium.

Aston Technical College (later renamed North Birmingham Technical College) moved to a new site in Perry Barr in the late 1960s, and was incorporated into the creation of Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University) in 1971. The site had formerly been the location of Birchfield Road Primary School and Birchfield Road Secondary Modern School.Two of the college&#x27;s buildings existed as part of the university&#x27;s City North Campus, but closed in 2018 when the site was again levelled and construction began on accommodation for athletes competing in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games 2022 in Perry Park.Delays in construction due to the Covid 19 pandemic meant that the accommodation was not completed in time to be used for this purpose. 

There is a mall-style shopping centre in the district known as &quot;One Stop&quot; Shopping Centre. This was built in the early 1990s, replacing a previous 1960s-era shopping centre. To facilitate the 1990s construction, a length of the River Tame was diverted and canalised. A Wetherspoons pub, the Arthur Robertson, opened later is named after Arthur Robertson, the Birchfield Harriers&#x27; first Olympic gold medallist (1908).

A memorial to PC Malcolm Walker, of the West Midlands Police, is situated outside shops on the city-bound side of Birchfield Road. He died on 4 October 2001, when his motorcycle was struck during a police pursuit.

The site of the former Perry Hall is now Perry Hall Park. Perry Park hosted the Birmingham Carnival in 2005.

==Transport==

Major roads in the ward and constituency include the M6 motorway and the A34. Bus routes operated by the National Express West Midlands Perry Barr bus garage in the area include Nos 11A, 11C, 33, 46, 51, 54, 68A, 68C, 907, 907A, 934, 937, 937A (evenings and Sundays), 952, 997, and 997E (towards Pheasey). The A4040 and A34 roads cross at Perry Barr, the former carrying the Birmingham Outer Circle bus routes. In addition the A453 towards Sutton Coldfield begins at Perry Barr.

Route X51 runs through Perry Barr, but does not stop in Perry Barr. The nearest stop on the route is Walsall Road, Alexander Stadium before running non-stop to Birmingham City Centre.

To the south-west of the ward is the Walsall line, part of the old Grand Junction Railway, which has two railway stations within the boundaries of the ward; Hamstead railway station and Perry Barr railway station. The latter, opened in 1837, is one of the oldest stations in the country to remain on its original site.

The Tame Valley Canal bisects the ward, with boats from Salford Junction, under Gravelly Hill Interchange climbing the 13-flight Perry Barr Locks towards Hamstead and on to Rushall Junction. There is a feeder reservoir, Perry Reservoir, in Perry Park.

The River Tame passes through the area and is crossed by several bridges, including Perry Bridge, a scheduled ancient monument of 1711, on the line of the Roman Ryknild Street and its 1932 Art Deco replacement carrying the Aldridge Road. The old bridge appears on the badge of nearby Handsworth Grammar School. A stream, the Holbrook, originating on the slopes of Barr Beacon, flows into the river just upstream from the bridge. The area around the bridge is known as Holford.

==Sport==

Aston Manor Cricket Club are situated in Perry Barr, as is the international athletics stadium Alexander Stadium. These are located on Church Road just by Perry Park. The Hub on Holford Drive is home to Continental Star F.C., as well as Continental Star Cricket, Continental Stars table tennis club, tennis clubs, and Aston Amateur Boxing Club.

Perry Barr Greyhound Stadium on the Aldridge Road plays host to two sports: greyhound racing, which is primarily run on Saturday nights with daytime meetings during the week, and speedway, the team racing there being the Birmingham Brummies, who run on a Wednesday night schedule from April to October. The Birmingham Brummies currently ride in the SGB Championship which is the second tier of British speedway.

==Ward==
The Perry Barr ward is part of the Birmingham, Perry Barr parliamentary constituency. Following boundary changes in 2004, the eastern edge of the ward follows the M6 motorway from Spaghetti Junction to junction 7 at Great Barr, including parts of the communities of Witton, Aston, Perry Barr and Great Barr.

Since 2004, the three councillors representing Perry Barr on Birmingham City Council have been Ray Hassall, Karen Hamilton and Jon Hunt, all of them Liberal Democrats. Hassall was elected in 1990, Hunt in 2003 and Hamilton in 2004. Hamilton became the first black councillor elected for the ward. In a 2017 by-election, Morriam Jan, elected as a Liberal Democrat, became the first councillor of South Asian origin elected for the ward.

Prior to 1990, the ward had a strong tendency towards the Conservative Party. No single party held all the seats in the ward between 1990 and 2004. The Liberal Democrats took a clean sweep at the 2004 Council Elections in which all seats were contested, but only after three recounts. In 2006, Hamilton increased her personal majority from 31 to more than 1,500, and the party went on to win every election in the ward until boundary changes in 2018.

The ward had Labour representation for a period, from 1995 till 2004 following the election of Mike Leddy (1995–2003), along with the defection of Ron Whitehouse from the Liberal Democrats to the Labour Party (2000–2004).

For the 2018 and any subsequent elections the ward was reduced in size to two councillors and parts of the former Aston ward, included in 2004, were returned to a new Aston ward. The new Perry Barr ward includes Witton Cemetery and the Moor Lane Sports Ground.

<doc id="663216" wikidata="Q1788078" url="?curid=663216" title="Selly Oak">
<text>Selly Oak is an industrial and residential area in south-west Birmingham, England. The area gives its name to Selly Oak ward and includes the neighbourhoods of: Bournbrook, Selly Park, and Ten Acres. The adjoining wards of Edgbaston and Harborne are to the north of the Bourn Brook, which was the former county boundary, and to the south are Weoley, and Bournville. A district committee serves the four wards of Selly Oak, Billesley, Bournville and Brandwood. The same wards form the Birmingham Selly Oak constituency, represented since 2024 by Alistair Carns (Labour). Selly Oak is connected to Birmingham by the Pershore Road (A441) and the Bristol Road (A38). The Worcester and Birmingham Canal and the Birmingham Cross-City Railway Line run across the Local District Centre.

The 2001 population census recorded 25,792 people living in Selly Oak, with a population density of 4,236 people per km2 compared with 3,649 people per km2 for Birmingham. It had 15.9% of the population consisting of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. As the University of Birmingham is nearby, there are many students in the area.

==Toponymy==
Selly Oak is recorded in the Domesday Book as Escelie. The name Selly is derived from variants of &quot;scelf-lei&quot; or shelf-meadow, that is, pasture land on a shelf or terrace of land, probably the glacial deposits formed after the creation and later dispersal of Lake Harrison during the Quaternary period. Another source for the name comes from the Old English &#x27;sele&#x27; meaning a building, or a hall.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
A small pit recorded in a service trench near Bournville Lane, Selly Oak produced the oldest pottery found in Birmingham so far. Twenty eight sherds, representing about five different vessels, in decorated Grooved Ware pottery of Late Neolithic date, were recovered. The Bronze Age pit found immediately adjacent to the site was also a highly important archaeological discovery, since prehistoric structures other than burnt mounds are extremely rare in Birmingham. Examples of finds in this area include:

Bond Street Stone Axe (MBM859); Bourn Brook Burnt Mound (MBM2484); Bourn Brook Burnt Mounds (MBM359); California, Burnt Mound (MBM777); Falconhurst Road Barbed and Tanged Arrowhead (MBM1776); King’s Heath/Stirchley Brook Perforated Implement, axe hammer (MBM1793); Moor End Farm Burnt Mound (MBM778). Northfield Relief Road pit (MBM2455). Ridgacre Burnt Mound, near Moor Farm (MBM779); Selly Oak Flint Flake (MBM2219); Selly Park Recreation Ground Prehistoric Finds (MBM2002); Shenley Lane, Northfield flint scraper (MBM1801); Ten Acres Burnt Mound (MBM1584); Vicarage Farm Axe Hammer (MBM860). Weoley Park Road Neolithic Flint Scraper (MBM869).

===Roman===
Metchley Fort was established c. AD 48 and occupied until c. 200 AD. Two Roman Roads appear to have met there. Ryknield or Icknield Street was laid out between Bourton-on-the-Water and Derby in the mid-to-late 1st century to serve the needs of military communication. It passed through Alcester, Selly Oak, Birmingham, and Sutton Coldfield to Wall. A little north of Birmingham it passed through the important military camp of Perry. At Bournbrook it threw off a branch called the Hadyn Way that passed through Stirchley and Lifford to Alcester. The road kept to the west of Birmingham to avoid the swamps and marshes along the course of the River Rea. The second road is generally called the Upper Saltway running north from Droitwich Spa to the Lincolnshire coast. Its route is uncertain but is generally believed to follow the line of the A38. 

Droitwich and Alcester were connected by the Lower Saltway. Wall was previously a Roman centre named Letocetum and it was near here that Ryknield (Icknield) Street crossed Watling Street, now the A5, which ran north-west from London to Wroxeter. The Staffordshire Hoard was found near here within a triangle of roads from the Roman and Anglo-Saxon periods that cannot all be dated. Possible evidence of Roman remains exist in the place names of Stirchley (formerly Stretley and Strutley) Street; Moor Street, near Woodgate Valley in Bartley Green; and Street Farm in Northfield where two Turnpike Roads met. Evidence of Roman activity through finds in the area include:

Allens Croft Road/Brandwood Park Road Roman Coin (MBM981); Harborne Bridge, Roman Road (MBM1639); Hazelwell Street Roman Road (MBM1902); Icknield Street, Walkers Heath, Roman Road (B12227); Lodge Hill, coin of Gordian III: Roman (MBM1020); Longdales Road Roman Farmstead (B12342); Metchley Roman Forts (MBM370); Northfield Relief Road pottery (MBM2421); Parsons Hill Roman occupation 0AD to 299AD (B1824); Raddlebarn Road Roman Coin (MBM988); Selly Oak Roman Coin – commemorative coin of Constantine 1 (MBM872); Selly Park Spindle Whorl (MBM982); Stirchley Roman Coin, a gold aureus of Vespasian minted at Tarraco in the last quarter of the year 70AD (MBM983); Stocks Wood irregular Earthwork (MBM1944); Tiverton Road Roman Coins – denarii (MBM2067); Weoley Castle Roman Coin of Antoninianus (MBM1016); Woodgate Valley Roman coin of Trajan (MBM1013).

===Anglo-Saxon and Norman===
There are two entries in Domesday Book for Selly Oak (Escelie). The first entry for Selly Oak records a nuncupative (oral) will and is out of conventional order. Wulfwin had leased the manor for the term of three lives and the newly appointed Bishop of Lichfield, Robert de Limesey, used the will to challenge the loss of his land. &quot;Wulfwin bought this manor before 1066 from the Bishop of Chester, for the lives of three men. When he was ailing and had come to the end of his life, he summoned his son, the Bishop of Li (chfield?), his wife and many of his friends and said: &#x27;Hear me, my friends, I desire that my wife hold this land which I bought from the church so long as she lives, and that after her death the church from which I received it should accept it back. Let whoever shall take it away from it be excommunicated&#x27;. The more important men of the whole County testify that this was so.&quot; The first entry records Bartley Green as an outlier, or dependency of Selly Oak, while the second entry doesn&#x27;t include Bartley Green but records Selly Oak is held as two manors. The second entry also shows that Wibert had been replaced as sub-tenant by Robert suggesting the challenge may have been partially successful. The Bishop of Chester owned Lichfield and its members. These include Harborne, in Staffordshire until 1891, which was held by Robert.

Wulfwin owned several manors which indicates he was wealthy and important, possibly an aristocrat. Indeed, he has been described as a great thegn, the son of Wigod, and the grandson of Woolgeat, the Danish Earl of Warwick. His mother was the sister of Leofric III, Earl of Mercia. The possessions that came to him by the Dano-Saxon marriage of his parents seem to have been rather extensive. In King Edward the Confessor’s time Wulfwin (also referred to as Alwyne and Ulwin) was sheriff and through his son Turchill, who came to be Earl of Warwick, the Ardens and the Bracebridges trace their descent from the Old Saxon kings.

One of the purposes of Domesday Book was to provide a written statement of the legal owners (Sub-tenants) and overlords (Barons) of the land in the reallocation of territories after the conquest. William Fitz-Ansculf, from Picquigny, Picardy in France, was assigned a Barony. He made his base at the Saxon, Earl Edwin’s, Dudley Castle. He and his successors were overlords of the manors of Selly Oak and Birmingham both of which had previously been owned by Wulfwin. It would appear that William Fitz Ansculf died during the First Crusade. Henry of Huntingdon in his &#x27;History of the English People&#x27; writes that: &quot;Then from the middle of February they besieged the castle of &#x27;Arqah, for almost three months. Easter was celebrated there (10 April). But Anselm of Ribemont, a very brave knight, died there, struck by a stone, and William of Picardy, and many others.&quot; Successors to the Barony included the Paganel and Somery families. In 1322 when John de Somery died the barony was divided between his two sisters Margaret de Sutton and Joan de Botetourt. Joan Botetourt was awarded a twenty-third of a knights fee in Selley which was held by Geoffrey de Selley who also held Bernak in Northamptonshire, and a quarter of a fee in Northfield which was held by John de Middleton.

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 Birmingham was a manor in Warwickshire with less than 3,000 acres. The current Birmingham Historic Landscape Characterisation project covers a total area of 26,798 ha (66,219 acres). Birmingham developed in the hinterland of three counties – Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire. Nearly 50% of this territory was formerly in either Staffordshire or Worcestershire but as the city expanded the ancient boundaries were changed in order that the area being administered came under one county authority – Warwickshire. The Saxon presence in the territory of modern Birmingham requires the inclusion of the Manors and Berewicks/Outliers mentioned in Domesday Book that are now part of the Birmingham conurbation. This is complicated by the fact that separate figures were not given for Harborne, Yardley, and King’s Norton which were all attached to manors outside the area. The Birmingham Plateau had about 26 Domesday Book manors, a population of close to 2,000, with seven mills, and three priests.

===Medieval===
The earliest Tax Roll for Selly Oak was the Lechmere Roll of 1276–1282. Selleye (Selly Oak) and Weleye (Weoley) were separate from the manor of Northfield. Of the twenty households listed the person who paid the most tax was William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke, who was the half-brother of Henry III and one of the wealthiest men in the kingdom.

The Papal Register 1291 shows that Northfield was an Ecclesiastic Parish which was connected with Dudley Priory. In the next Tax Roll in 1327 the entries for Selly Oak and Weoley were combined with those of Northfield. This suggests a time-frame for the establishment of the Parish of Northfield.

===20th century and contemporary===
Two tornadoes touched down in Birmingham on 23 November 1981 as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day. The second tornado, rated as an F1/T2 tornado, touched down in Selly Oak at about 14:00 local time, causing some damage across the southern suburbs of Birmingham.

In the late 20th century a road-widening scheme for the Bristol Road (A38) was carried out. Many historic buildings, including the offices of Birmingham Battery and Metal Company and the Westley Richards Gun Factory, were demolished. However, plans for a major regeneration of the area were confirmed in 2005 and a new 1.5 km stretch of road was opened in August 2011 to access the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. The work has involved the construction of the Aerial aqueduct to carry the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and a railway viaduct for the Cross-City Line. This scheme has paved the way for the enhancement of the Battery Retail Park shopping complex and a number of familiar High Street shops have opened stores.

==Manors and parishes==
The ecclesiastical parish of Selly Oak (1861)[8] appears to identify the original boundary of the ancient manor. The Order in Council at the Court at Windsor held on 7 June 1862 set the boundary as follows: &quot;All that part of the parish of Northfield, in the County of Worcester, wherein the present incumbent of such parish now possesses the exclusive cure of souls, which is situate to the north-east of an imaginary line commencing upon the boundary dividing the said parish of Northfield from the parish of Harborne, in the county of Stafford, and in the diocese of Lichfield, at a point in the middle of the road leading from Hart’s Green, past Shenley Field Farm, to the Birmingham and Bromsgrove Turnpike road; and extending thence, in a direction generally south-ward, along the middle of the said road leading from Hart’s Green aforesaid to a point in the middle of the said Turnpike road near to White-hill; and extending thence north-eastward, along the middle of the same Turnpike road for a distance of five hundred and twenty-eight yards, or thereabouts, to a point opposite to the middle of the northern end of Hole Lane; and extending thence, south-eastward, to and along the middle of such lane as far as a point opposite to the middle of the last named lane; and then generally north-eastward, along the middle of the same lane, to the boundary dividing the said parish of Northfield, from the parish of King’s Norton, in the county and diocese of Worcester aforesaid at a point in the middle of Gallows Brook&quot;.

In Domesday Book Berchelai now Bartley Green was identified as an Outlier of Selly Oak. The boundaries of the daughter parish of Bartley Green were established in 1838. There are errors concerning Bartley Green that need to be corrected. The VCH Warwickshire – City of Birmingham states: &quot;The ancient parish of Northfield, covering 6,011 acres, was also originally in Worcestershire, its northern boundary with Harborne (formerly in Staffordshire) and Edgbaston (formerly in Warwickshire) being marked by the Bourn Brook, part of its eastern boundary with King’s Norton by the Rea and Griffins Brook. Except for under 200 acres of the north-west tip of the parish, which was added to Lapal civil parish, Northfield was included in Birmingham in 1911; from 1898 until then it had been part of the Urban District of King’s Norton and Northfield&quot;. The portion not included in the transfer to Birmingham was transferred to Illey not Lapal. The online version of the transfer states: &quot;The parish of Northfield is situated on the northern border of the county, but with the exception of the Bartley Green area, which was annexed to Lapal, Northfield was incorporated in the city of Birmingham by the Birmingham Extension Act, 1911&quot;. This has repeatedly been misread to exclude the whole of Bartley Green from incorporation into Birmingham.

The three Domesday Book manors of Northfield, Selly Oak and its outlier Bartley Green formed the Parish of Northfield in Worcestershire. The Domesday Book manor of Northfield was not coterminous with the later parish of Northfield. Unfortunately there has been some confusion between manor and parish. As this has had an adverse impact on Selly Oak, and also Bartley Green, it seems advisable to identify the boundaries of Northfield.

In Domesday Book Northfield had a priest and was valued at £8 before 1066. This suggests it was an ecclesiastical centre at the time of the Norman Conquest. As no sub-tenant was appointed was Northfield, which shares a boundary with King’s Norton (Nortune), a royal manor?

The 1820 sale of the manor of Northfield and Weoley defines the boundary of the ancient manor. &quot;One of the Lots will comprise the extensive Manor of Northfield and Weoley, with several eligible Farms, containing together about 1200 acres, principally tithe free, lying within a ring fence, and let to respectable tenants, at moderate rents. This Lot is very eligible for the investment of capital, or might suit any Gentleman desirous of residing on his own estate, there being on one of the Farms a very commodious House, with suitable outbuildings, which, at a moderate expense, might be rendered a desirable residence, being within a convenient distance from the Birmingham and Worcester Turnpike Road, and not, intersected by any public carriage road, and affording every facility for the preservation of game. Many of the other Lots adjoin the Turnpike Road, and are very eligible as building ground, and the whole Estate is well circumstanced with regard to roads and navigable canals. The whole of this property, with the exception of the Glebe in Cofton Hackett, is situate in the parish of Northfield, in the County of Worcestershire, on the high turnpike road from Birmingham to Worcester, and is distant five miles from the former place&quot;. 

A map of the estate was drawn up by J &amp; F Surveyors in 1817 and this provides more useful information. Two turnpike roads met at Northfield. The Birmingham and Worcester turnpike road which is now the Bristol Road (A38) and the Northfield to Wootton Wawen turnpike road which runs southwards down Church Hill, past Turves Green and West Heath until it joins the Alvechurch Road (A441). As this was also a direct route to Evesham it may have been a medieval, if not older, route. The map shows two mills, Northfield (Digbeth) and Wychall which would fit with the description of Weley Manor on the death of Roger de Someri in 1272.

Two manor house sites were shown amongst the lots. Middleton Hall was presumably the location of the residence of the Middleton family. The larger moated site, adjacent to the Church, is suggested to have been the original manor house of Northfield. The claim that stone from the Quarry Lane site was used to build Weoley Castle is interesting and questionable. Weoley Castle lies just north of a rocky outcrop between Jervoise Road and Alwold Road from which the stone was cut. a further point for consideration is that Great Ley Hill was included among the lots for sale. Five of the fields were called: 370 Round Wheely, 371 Round Wheeley, 372 Long Wheeley, 1114 Middle Wheely, and 1115 Long Wheely. Fernando Smith, who owned 123 acres, was an heir of the Barony of Dudley had it not gone into abeyance.

The parishes of Northfield and King’s Norton joined to form a Rural District Council which quickly changed to King’s Norton and Northfield Urban District Council in 1898. The opportunity to form an independent Borough was resisted in favour of unity with Birmingham City Council. In 1911 the area administered by Birmingham was almost trebled by a further extension of its boundaries under the Greater Birmingham Act. Previous extensions in 1889, 1891, and 1911 had seen Birmingham grow from 2,996 acres to 13,478 acres. Balsall Heath (1891) and Quinton (1909) were both transferred from Worcestershire, while Harborne was transferred from Staffordshire. In 1911 the boundaries were extended to include: the borough of Aston Manor (Warwickshire); Erdington Urban District (Warwickshire); Handsworth Urban District (Staffordshire); most of King’s Norton and Northfield Urban District (Worcestershire); and Yardley Rural District (Worcestershire). The area administered by Birmingham was almost trebled from 13,478 acres to 43,601 acres. 

Further additions to the city were made in 1928 and 1931, and after the VCH Warwickshire Volume V11 – The City of Birmingham was first published in 1964 making an updated study desirable, particularly regarding the transfer of areas from the neighbouring counties of Worcestershire and Staffordshire. An editorial note states that &quot;Accounts of the Worcestershire Parishes, that ceased to exist when the administrative authority of Greater Birmingham was established, are contained in Volume III of the VCH History of Worcestershire&quot;. The Historic Landscape Characterisation of Birmingham covers a total area of 26,798 ha (66,210 acres) giving an indication of the growth of Birmingham since 1889.

==Industrialisation==
===Lime kilns===
The archaeology report following an excavation identifies that the limekilns were built shortly after the Dudley Canal line No. 2 was opened in 1798. A map of 1828 showed five lime kilns within a single block on James Whitehouse’s Wharfs on the Worcester to Birmingham canal. There was some rebuilding during the 1850s and they were redundant by the 1870s. The two eastern kilns were truncated by the railway. Older kilns may be buried beneath those that were excavated. The block of kilns would have dominated the landscape at the time and were designed to satisfy an obviously large demand. They were on a direct route to Birmingham’s first gasworks opened in 1818 at the terminus of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal.

They represent one of the earliest industries established in Selly Oak area which are associated with the Industrial Revolution. This is early evidence of a large scale industrial process taking place in Selly Oak and of great significance for Birmingham. They are the only ones of their type excavated in Birmingham.

Other items found during the excavation revealed post-medieval pottery: Cream-wares dateable to 1760-1780 predate the lime kilns although it wasn&#x27;t always possible to excavate below the existing structures. Red sandy-ware also suggests a late 18th-century date.

In 1822 the canal company approved the takeover by William Povey of the coal and lime business already established on the wharf by a Mr. James. The tenancy was transferred to James Whitehouse of Frankley in 1836. He lived on the wharf, carrying on a business in coal and lime and also keeping a shop until the 1870s. On the Dudley Canal side of the Birmingham Battery and Metal Co Ltd there are indications of further lime kilns beside William Summerfield’s wharfs that have not been excavated.

===Chemical industry===
When John Sturge died Edward brought his brother-in-law, Arthur Albright, into partnership. They first made white phosphorus in 1844 but this was volatile. Albright invented a process of manufacturing red, or amorphous, phosphorus for which he obtained a patent in 1851. Their chemical works was reported to have caused several explosions. When an application is made for building work, as part of the regeneration programme for Selly Oak, it will have a condition for an archaeological excavation of the site to be carried out. A newspaper article in 1839 concerning the damage caused by a hurricane reported that 20 yards of a substantially built wall was demolished at Sturges Works and at the Sal-ammonite works of Mr Bradley at the same place, 30 feet of the large stack was hurled to the ground with such tremendous force as to destroy a stable and dash in a portion of the roof of the evaporating house connected with the building.

===Selly Oak well and pumping station===
Near to the library and set back from the Bristol Road is a tall, enigmatic listed building. Selly Oak Well and pumping Station was built by the Birmingham Corporation Water Department in the 1870s but was not formally opened until July 1879 by Joseph Chamberlain. The well was 12 feet in diameter and with a total depth of 300 feet. It has a solid casing of masonry 14 inches thick extending 80 feet from the surface. The engine beam was 31½ feet in length and weighed 20 tons. The cylinder was 60 inches in diameter and had a stroke of 11 feet. It was built by Messrs James Watt and Co. By 1881, after further lateral borings, the output was one and a quarter million gallons each day. The well was capped in 1920 as the Elan Valley supplied all the water that was required. The building is described in its national listing as a tall brick and terracotta building with stone dressings, in a Gothic style associated with Chamberlain. It appears as a tall version of a French Gothic Chapel.

==Transport and communications==
===Roads===
The former Bristol Road trams were replaced with buses in 1952. The original tram sheds were demolished around 2005 to make way for flats, and Selly Oak bus garage closed as an operational garage in 1986 but continued as a vehicle store for West Midlands Travel. It was converted into a self-storage depot around 1990.

The majority of bus services are operated by National Express West Midlands including the 11A/11C Outer Circle. First Midland Red operated service 144 between Birmingham and Worcester via Bromsgrove. First curtailed service 144 at Catshill from 1 May 2022 due to low passenger numbers.

===Canals===
2015 was the bi-centenary of the opening of the Worcester and Birmingham canal (1815–2015). This connected Birmingham to Worcester and the River Severn, and then to Gloucester with its International trade routes. The speed with which the canal system was constructed is phenomenal, perhaps due to the war with France that began in 1793, and the need to transport the heavy minerals – coal, iron-ore, and limestone from the Black Country. Selly Port was the centre of activity.
The Worcester and Birmingham Canal Act 1791 (31 Geo. 3. c. 59) approved the construction and with two further acts authorised the raising of £379,609 to pay for it. Barracks to accommodate the navvies at were established Bournbrook for 120 men, and Gallows Brook, Stirchley for 100 men. Between Selly Oak and Ley End to the south of the Wast Hill Tunnel six brick kilns were in operation. The network included three canals: the Worcester-Birmingham, the Netherton, or Dudley Canal line No. 2, and the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal.

The construction work involved: cuttings, bridges, tunnels, aqueducts, and embankments that were all built using manual labour from &#x27;navvies&#x27;. Some of the bridges were initially constructed from wood with accommodation drawbridges, or roving bridges, inserted where the canal cut across farms or estates. Initially few locks were needed other than stop-locks or the guillotine Lock at King’s Norton. There were three tunnels: Lapal (3,795 yds), Brandwood (352 yds), and Wast Hills Tunnel (2,726 yds).

The section of the Worcester-Birmingham canal to Selly Oak was opened in 1795. In May 1798 the Netherton to Selly Oak canal was opened to great festivities. By 1802 a route was opened from Dudley to London. To appease mill owners, reservoirs were constructed at Harborne, Lifford Reservoir and Wychall Reservoir. In 1815 issues regarding the Worcester Bar in Gas Street, Birmingham were resolved and the final section through Tardibigge to Worcester was completed.

Arrangements have been negotiated for reinstating part of the Dudley No. 2 Canal through the former Birmingham Battery and Metal Company site, as part of a long-term plan to re-establish the canal route to Halesowen and the Black Country.

===Rail===
The Birmingham West Suburban Railway agreed a land rental deal with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to allow construction which was authorised in 1871, and opened as a single line track in 1876 from Granville Street to Lifford. The Birmingham West Suburban Railway was bought out by the Midland Railway to allow their trains to pass through Birmingham without turning having used the Camp Hill line, they extended the tracks south to a junction south with the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway at Kings Norton, and double-tracked the entire line length. The line was slightly realigned in the early 1930s. The stub of the old alignment has recently been demolished. Five stations were opened including Selly Oak. The terminus was changed to New Street. The line was doubled in 1883, and by 1885, it had become the Midland Railway’s main line to Gloucester. During World War I casualties were transported into Selly Oak and transferred to the First Southern and General Military Hospital which was housed in the new University of Birmingham buildings. The convoys often ran at night to avoid noise and traffic, and to limit the demoralising sight of the considerable number of people wounded during the conflict. In the 1920s the central part of the viaduct over the Bristol Road was replaced with the current steel bridge to enable higher trams to pass beneath it. The station complex was rebuilt in 1978 and again in 2003. 

Selly Oak is currently served by Selly Oak railway station on the Cross-City Line, providing services to the , , and stations.

==The &#x27;Oak&#x27; tree==
The Oak element of the name Selly Oak comes from a prominent oak tree that formerly stood at the crossroads of the Bristol Road and Oak Tree Lane/Harborne Lane. The original spot is still commemorated by an old Victorian street sign above one of the shops on the north-side of Oak Tree Lane, which declares it to be &quot;Oak Tree Place&quot; and has the date of 1880.
The oak that stood there was finally felled in May 1909 amid fears about its safety, due to damage to its roots caused by the building of the nearby houses. The tree was cut-up and the stump removed to Selly Oak Park, where it remains to this day, bearing a brass plaque that reads &quot;Butt of Old Oak Tree from which the name of Selly Oak was derived. Removed from Oak Tree Lane, Selly Oak 1909&quot;. By 2011 the stump had become quite rotten and the brass plaque was no longer secure. It was removed by the Friends of Selly Oak Park and replaced with a replica plaque. The original was retained by the Friends for conservation. The remains of the stump were left in the park.
The earliest attestations for the name &#x27;Selly Oak&#x27; date from 1746, and come from the manorial court rolls for the Manor of Northfield and Weoley, of which the district of Selly was a part. The stump of the old oak in Selly Oak Park was examined using dendrochronology, and the results gave a date of 1710–1720 for when the tree began growing. It is therefore thought that the tree became a landmark following the turnpiking of the road from Bromsgrove to Birmingham (now the Bristol Road), which began in 1727.

An older name for the same crossroads, where the road from King&#x27;s Norton to Harborne (now represented by Oak Tree/Harborne Lanes) met the Bromsgrove to Birmingham road (now the Bristol Road), appears to have been Selly Cross; at least this is what it was called during the 16th century when it was recorded as &quot;Selley Crosse&quot; in 1549 and &quot;Selley Cross&quot; in 1506.

The supposed tradition that the original oak was associated with a witch named Sarah or Sally is without foundation, and is likely to have arisen as a means of explaining what may have been a variant and local pronunciation of the name as &#x27;Sally&#x27; Oak. Indeed, the name is actually recorded as &quot;Sally Oak&quot; on a canal map produced by John Snape in 1789.

In March 1985, a &#x27;new&#x27; Selly Oak was planted by local Councillors on the north side of Bristol Road on the small triangle of land between Harborne Lane and the Sainsbury&#x27;s site, following road improvements to the junction. A second &#x27;new&#x27; Selly Oak was planted in October 2000 at Bentella&#x27;s Corner on the south side of Bristol Road, on the opposite side of Oak Tree Lane to the original site. In addition, there may also have been a third planting of yet another &#x27;new&#x27; Selly Oak, next to the extension to Sainsbury&#x27;s car park, after the demolition of The Great Oak pub in 1993. All of these Oaks are still growing.

==Education==

Schools include Selly Oak School, Selly Park Girls Technology College, St Edwards RC, Raddlebarn Primary &amp; Nursery, Tiverton Road, and St Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School.

The following is the history of the schools in Selly Oak Ward taken from the Victoria County History that was published in 1964 and accordingly the information requires updating.

St Edwards RC Primary School, Elmdon Road: The school opened 1874 as St Paul’s RC School, in new buildings with one schoolroom and one classroom. It moved into new buildings in 1895 and the name changed to St Edwards RC School. A new schoolroom was provided in 1897 increasing the accommodation for 120 children. It was altered and enlarged in 1909 and further improvements were required in 1912. In 1953 it was reorganised for Junior and Infants. Teaching was conducted by the Sisters of the Charity of St Paul.

St Mary’s C of E Primary School, High Street, Selly Oak (Bristol Road): 
It opened as a National School in 1860 with accommodation for 252 children. It was enlarged in 1872 and ten years later the boys and girls were separated. When St Mary’s National School was opened in Hubert Road Bournbrook in 1885 the girls were transferred there and the National School was used for boys and infants. In 1898 the schools were united for administration and called Selly Oak and Bournbrook Schools. A third department was opened in 1898, in Dawlish Road, to accommodate 545 senior girls and the Infants department. Selly Oak School was used for junior girls and Infants. Bournbrook School was used for boys with accommodation for 200 boys provided at the Bournbrook Technical Institute from 1901 to 1903. The original school was on the Bristol Road between Frederick Road and Harborne Lane. It was rebuilt on Lodge Hill Road and the old building was demolished in order to widen the road.

The Selly Oak and Bournbrook Temporary Council School was opened by King’s Norton and Northfield UDC in 1903 in the room that was previously used as an annexe of Selly Oak and Bournbrook C of E School. The premises were not satisfactory and the school was closed in 1904 when Raddlebarn Lane Temporary Council School was opened. Selly Oak School was damaged in 1908 by a gale and the premises were condemned in 1912. The schools were separated in 1914 with the 1885 Hubert Road and 1898 Dawlish Road buildings becoming St Wulstan’s C of E school. Selly Oak School became St Mary’s C of E School. In 1946 accommodation was also provided in the People’s Hall, Oak Tree Lane.

Selly Hill C of E, Warwards Lane. Ten Acres Church School opened in 1874 to accommodate 125 children. The name changed in 1884 to Selly Hill Church School. It was sometimes known as St Stephen’s Church School, or as Dogpool National School. It was enlarged in 1885 and a new school was opened on an adjoining site opened in 1898 to accommodate 440 children. Further enlargement and alterations took place in 1914, and after reorganisation in 1927 and 1931 the school closed in 1941. Between 1951 and 1954 the buildings were used by Selly Park County Primary School and from 1954 by Raddlebarn Lane Boys County Modern School.

Selly Oak Boys County Modern School, Oak Tree Lane, was opened in 1961 with nine classrooms, practical rooms and a hall.

Selly Park County Primary School, Pershore Road, opened in 1911 to accommodate 1,110 boys, girls and infants and enabled the closure of Fashoda Road Temporary Council School. The buildings were altered and the school reorganised in 1931–32. In 1945 the senior department became a separate school. St Stephen&#x27;s Parochial Hall provided accommodation for two classes from 1947 to 1954. War damage was repaired in 1950 and in 1955 children were transferred to Moor Green County Primary School with one building used as an annexe of this new school.

Selly Park Girls&#x27; County Modern School, Pershore Road became a separate school in 1945, accommodating 440, in the buildings of the County Primary School.

Fashoda Road Temporary Council School was opened by King’s Norton and Northfield UDC in 1904 and closed with the opening of Selly Park Council School.

Raddlebarn Lane County Primary School In 1905 King’s Norton and Northfield UDC opened a temporary school in iron buildings for the Selly Oak and Bournbrook Temporary Council School from the Bournbrook Technical Institute. Accommodation for 126 was provided in a Primitive Methodist Chapel. Permanent buildings replacing the hut opened in 1909 as Raddlebarn Lane Council School with accommodation for 800 children.

Raddlebarn Lane Boy’s County Modern School This became a separate school in 1945 with additional accommodation provided in 1951 in the Friends Meeting House, Raddlebarn Road, and from 1954 in the former St Stephen’s C of E School in Warwards Lane.

==Selly Oak colleges==
This information has been gathered from the Victoria County History which was published in 1964 so there is a need to add to it.

Woodbrooke College, Bristol Road. This was the former home of Josiah Mason, George Richards Elkington, and George and Elizabeth Cadbury. It was opened in 1903 as a residential settlement for religious and social study for Friends. A men’s hostel, Holland House was opened from 1907 to 1914. By 1922 more than 400 foreign students and 1,250 British students had passed through the college. Only about 50% of these belonged to the Society of Friends.

A separate missionary college was established at Westholme in 1905, this was the house of J W Hoyland. A year later it moved into permanent quarters at Kingsmead. By 1931 the Methodists had added Queen’s Hostel for women.

Westhill College was created in 1907 as a result of gifts by Mr. and Mrs. Barrow Cadbury. The building erected in 1914 was named after its first principle, G H Archibald.

Fircroft College was a working men’s college conceived as a place of training for Adult-School workers. The college moved to The Dell in 1909 which was renamed Fircroft. The college moved in 1957 to Primrose Hill, George Cadbury’s old home, and this was renamed Fircroft.

Carey Hall, Weoley Park Road was opened in 1912 as a joint venture of the Baptist Missionary Society, and the London Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church of England for training women missionary candidates.

The College of the Ascension, opened 1929, replaced the original Westhill College building as a training institution for women missionaries for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.

The YWCA College began work in 1926 moving to new premises in College Walk.

The Churches of Christ Theological College moved from Park Road, Moseley to Overdale in 1931.

The Beeches, built by George Cadbury before 1914, was used from 1925 to 1933 as a holiday home for non-conformist ministers and their wives. It became The Beeches Educational Centre for Women from 1933 to 1939. After the War it was used by Cadbury Brothers Ltd as a trade college.

St Brigid’s House, Weoley Park Road, was a second Anglican college, which initially shared premises with the College of the Ascension.

The Anglican Industrial Christian Fellowship Training College was also situated in Weoley Park Road from 1954 to 1956.

St Andrews College, a united men’s missionary college was opened in Elmfield before moving to Lower Kingsmead.

A Central Council of governing bodies of the colleges was created in 1919. George Cadbury gave extensive playing fields in 1922 on which a pavilion was erected in 1928. The Rendel Harris Reference Library, named after the first tutor at Woodbrooke College, was opened in 1925 in a large house called Rokesley. After World War 2 the building was extended and became the Gillett Centre for students&#x27; recreation and sports. It had a swimming pool and squash courts. 
The George Cadbury Memorial Hall was built by Dame Elizabeth Cadbury and opened in 1927. A new library was built in 1932.

A new Life Sciences campus will be created for the University of Birmingham.

==King&#x27;s Norton union workhouse==

Selly Oak Hospital began as a workhouse. It was built in 1872 for the King’s Norton Poor law Union which was formed in 1836 and included the Parishes of Beoley, King’s Norton, Northfield (Worcestershire), Harborne and Smethwick (Staffordshire), and Edgbaston (Warwickshire). The architect was Edward Homes who had designed St Mary’s Church. By 1879 the hospital catered for 400 patients including the poor but also the aged, sick, and infirm. In 1895 the foundation stone was laid for a new infirmary designed by Daniel Arkell. In 1906 the Woodlands was built as a home for nurses. The school of nursing was officially opened in 1942.

In 1911 Selly Oak became part of the Birmingham Union for Poor Law responsibility. By the Local Government Act 1929 the functions of the boards of guardians were transferred to the local authorities and Birmingham Corporation became responsible for the administration of public assistance and for 16 institutions containing 6,000 patients. Selly Oak hospital, with 550 patients, was administered by the public health, maternity, and welfare committee becoming a general and not poor law hospital. For many years the workhouse and infirmary buildings have been used as offices and consulting rooms rather than as wards for patients. The main prosthetic limb production and fitment centre for the West Midlands is still functioning.

The Centre for Defence Medicine was located at Selly Oak Hospital and casualties from the Iraq War and War in Afghanistan were treated there. When the university hospitals Birmingham trust NHS foundation trust was formed in 1997 Selly Oak Hospital and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital were jointly administered. A new hospital has been built beside the old QE and Selly Oak Accident and Emergency Department was closed with the transfer of patients beginning on 16 June 2010. The hospital in now fully closed, with all NHS services consolidated to the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. A significant group of buildings have been listed but 650 houses will be built on the site.

==Community==

The area is well served by all kinds of public facilities. These include: - Selly Oak Library which hosts the Selly Oak Library Local History Group.

Cinemas

The Oak Cinema was at the junction of the Bristol Road and Chapel Lane where Sainsbury’s supermarket is now. The cinema opened in 1924 and was later extended to seat over 1,500. The ABC minors children&#x27;s cinema club took place on Saturday mornings. The cinema closed in November 1979.

The ‘Stickleback Picturedrome&#x27; was built in chapel Lane in 1913 beside the Plough and Harrow. In 1924 it was converted to a billiard hall and in 1950 became the Embassy Dance Club.

The People’s Hall, in Oak Tree Lane was used as a &#x27;picturedrome&#x27; for a few years around 1911.

Cemetery

There is one main cemetery in Selly Oak, Lodge Hill Cemetery, opened 1895, and run by Birmingham council since 1911. In 1937 Birmingham’s first Municipal Crematorium was built on the site. Its main entrance is on Weoley Park Road, at its junction with Gibbins Road and Shenley Fields Road.

Historic public houses

Photographic evidence exists for all of these pubs with the exception of &#x27;The Boat&#x27; and &#x27;The Junction&#x27;.

The Bear and Staff is situated at the junction of Bristol Road and Frederick Road.

The Boat was an early pub, beside the canal at the bottom of the Dingle, kept by Mr. Kinchin.

In 1881 the Country Girl, Raddlebarn Road, is listed as a beer garden. It has undergone various modifications. The cottages on the site have been used to give a more acceptable address to those born in the Workhouse.

Behind the façade of the Dog and Partridge was an old farmhouse which had sold its home-brewed beer from the early days of Selly Oak’s canal-side development. It had been run by an independent beer retailer, Butler’s of Wolverhampton, until 1938 when Mitchells and Butler bought it. It was positioned on the front of &#x27;The Dingle&#x27;. One of the people accused of and incorrectly imprisoned for the Carl Bridgewater murder was arrested in the now demolished Dog and Partridge public house. The pub and the Commercial buildings were demolished from the 1998s.
The original Dogpool Inn was on the corner of Pershore Road and Dogpool Lane, diagonally opposite where the current pub stands. It appears on an 1877 map. The landlord was Tom G H Thompson. It has had various names: Firkin, Hibernian and is now the New Dogpool Hotel It is an Art Nouveau style building with terracotta facing and a French Empire type roof.

The Junction Inn was situated on the canal wharf at the junction of the Dudley and W/B canals – a large house is shown on an 1873 map.

The Great Oak was a new pub opened on the Triangle; however access was nearly impossible due to traffic.

The original Oak Inn was on the corner of the Bristol Road and Harborne Lane. It was demolished during road improvements and for the development of the Triangle for the now closed Sainsbury’s store c. 1980. A Court of the Ancient Order of Foresters was held at the Oak Tree in Selly Oak. 

The Prince of Wales was on the site of Halfords on the Battery Retail Park.

The Plough and Harrow was formerly called the New Inn and took the name Plough and Harrow in 1904. The pub had moved to this site from further up the Bristol Road towards the Oak in about 1900. It was demolished for junction improvements in the 1980s.

The Selly Park Tavern, Pershore Road, was built in 1901 as the Selly Park Hotel, in the Arts and Crafts style for Holders Brewery. It replaced the Pershore Inn which probably dated back to the building of the Pershore Road in 1825. A skittle alley at the back is possibly one of the earlier Inn’s outbuildings.
Ten Acres Tavern was on the corner of Pershore Road and St Stephen&#x27;s Road which is now occupied by the New Dogpool Hotel. It was built by Holt’s brewery.

In 1900 the Village Bells, Harborne Lane, had William Caesley as landlord. It had become the Infant Welfare Centre by 1922. The building was reputedly used as a meeting place for the Primitive Methodists. The site was cleared for road widening.

The White Horse was in Chapel Lane.

Television

The BBC Drama Village is situated in Selly Oak, together with the Mill Health Centre where the BBC&#x27;s daytime soap &quot;Doctors&quot; is filmed.

Skate Park

Bournebrook skate park located near Aldi in Selly Oak was the first community built skate park to be given formal skatepark status

==Places of Worship==
George Richards Elkington put up most of the money to build St Mary&#x27;s Church on Bristol Road in 1861, built by the Birmingham architect Edward Holmes. There are several Elkington Burials in the Churchyard, including George Richards Elkington and his wife Mary Austen Elkington., and Brass Plates to Commemorate them within the name of the church. These rather amusingly show the couple with Victorian hairstyles and a mixture of Victorian and medieval clothing.

The Five Mile Act in 1665 meant Birmingham, although a large centre of population was not a borough, and was therefore exempt from the effects of the Act and attracted an influx of ex-preachers religious freedom made the town attractive. The Declaration of Indulgence of 1672 resulted in the licensing of meetings of which few seem to have been registered. The following is an update from the VCH City of Birmingham.

A Psychic Centre on the Bristol Road, Selly Oak was registered for public worship in 1946.

Christ Church, Selly Park, was formed from St Stephen’s parish.

There are two large Pentecostal congregations in Selly Oak. Selly Oak Elim Church (now called Encounter Church is situated in Exeter Road. Meanwhile, Christian Life Centre is located on Langleys Road in a purpose-built church opened in 1999 (the congregation had previously worshipped at Dame Elizabeth Cadbury School in Bournville). CLC hosts three meetings on Sundays and has a regular attendance of three hundred or more worshippers at its two morning services. CLC is also heavily engaged in social outreach work through its ACTS and ARK projects to assist vulnerable and marginalised people in the local area.

Raddlebarn Lane Mission Hall was opened in 1922. It was preceded by a corrugated iron building, seating around 150, built on the same site by Edward Cadbury in 1903. It was originally known as the Friends&#x27; Hall, Selly Hill which was destroyed by fire in 1916. During the intervening period the congregation met at Raddlebarn Lane Council School. The hall was closed in 1950 and subsequently used by Birmingham Corporation for educational purposes.

Selly Park Baptist Church was completed in 1877, at a cost of £3,400 of which W Middlemore subscribed £2,600 and, in 1892 provided 400 sittings. Services had previously been held in the Dog Pool Chapel, a wooden mission hall erected in 1867 in ST Stephen’s Road by members of Bradford Street Circus Chapel. The Sunday afternoon congregation in 1892 was 90. Church membership, 228 in 1938, had fallen in 1956 to 82. The congregation now meets in a new brick built annexe to the old church which is being renovated for use as a club.

St Paul’s Convent was founded in 1864 by the Sisters of Charity of St Paul but the mission was not established until 1889. A stable and coach-house in Upland Road was used until a school was built and part used as a chapel in 1895. The permanent church was opened in 1902 and completed in 1904. A new chapel was built in c. 1915. The Sisters managed a maternity home in Raddlebarn Road which is now St Mary’s Hospice.

The Society of Friends Meeting on the Bristol Road was in a brick building, seating 200, opened in 1927. Christian Society Meetings for worship are said to have been held in the Workman’s Hall, Selly oak from 1879, and in 1892 there was a Sunday evening congregation of 170 at Selly Oak meeting in a building seating 200.

The Workman’s Hall was a temperance club on the &#x27;British Workman&#x27; model, built on the initiative of a group on Unitarians in 1871.

Wesley Hall, a wooden building seating 150 on the Pershore Road, Selly Park, was opened by the Wesleyans in 1920 and cost £2,033. In 1940 three ancillary rooms were in use, of which one was built as a school hall. The congregation had previously met in an annexe of the council hall. Attendance in 1920 was estimated as 50, of whom 30 were church members. In 1932 membership was 38. The hall ceased to be registered for public worship in 1956.

==Industry==
William Bradley’s Sal-ammonite works were damaged by a hurricane when the chimney fell into the works in 1839. Bradley went bankrupt and his premises were bought by Sturges Chemical Works.

The Birmingham Battery and Metal Co Ltd began in 1836 in Digbeth from where they moved to Selly Oak 1871. A large part of the factory area was turned into a retail business park in c. 1990 and the works closed in c. 1990 and the buildings were demolished. Only the offices building remained thought by most to be a statutory listed building. There was local shock when this significant landmark building was also demolished. 
The company was founded by Thomas Gibbins in 1836 and became a limited company in 1897. Joseph Gibbins (1756–1811) was a banker and button maker from South Wales. He was a partner of Matthew Boulton in establishing the Rose Copper Mine. His son, Thomas Gibbins (1796–1863), took over the management of the business. 1n 1884 the very tall chimney was erected and became a local landmark. 
The Birmingham Battery and Metal Co Ltd used steam engines at Digbeth to work its battery hammers for making hollow-ware. A gas works was built on the site to power the engines driving the five large and several smaller rolling and tube mills, as well as provide lighting. This gas engine was sold in the 1920s, and the steam engines were gradually scrapped from 1908 onwards until by 1926 the factory was all electric. The company also had its own wells and during a drought supplied the canal company with water. The Gibbins family donated the land for Selly Oak Park and Selly Oak Library.

Boat builders: 1820s John Smith, James Price; c. 1850-70 William Monk; 1870-1894 William Hetherington followed by Edward Tailby until 1923. Matthew Hughes and Sons until the 1930s.

The 1884 First Edition OS map shows a brickworks on the site of the Birmingham Battery and Metal Company Ltd.

W Elliott &amp; Sons, Metal Rollers and Wire Drawers were established in 1853 on the site of Sturges Chemical Works. Elliott’s Patent Sheathing and Metal Co. was formed in 1862. In 1866 they bought Charles Green‘s business. Charles Green had taken out a patent (1838) for &quot;seamless&quot; tubes with respect to the drawing of copper tubes. In a major expansion plan in 1928 they were taken over by ICI Metals Group and in 
1964 transferred to Kynock Works at Witton.
Their products included rolled brass and copper sheet, drawn brass and copper wire, brass and copper tubes. There was significant production of an alloy known as Muntz metal, a patent of George Frederick Muntz, used for sheathing the hulls of wooden ships. They also made telegraph wire for the post office. The management included Neville Chamberlain from 1897 to 1924. During the war they made munitions and also millions of rivets for army boots.

Goodman and Co Builders Merchants acquired Edward Tailby’s wharf to add to the land they had near the railway bridge from 1905. They transported bricks, slates, sand, cement, and other building materials from their wharf basin. They also supplied domestic fuel and coal. The canal arm was filled in around 1947 and used to extend the builder’s yard which continued to operate until 2000. In 1879 it supplied the materials to build the Birmingham Council House

Guests Brass Stamping, formerly part of Guest, Keen, and Nettlefolds, was taken over by Birmingham Battery and Metal Company Ltd.

Architects drawings for a new frontage for the Premier Woven Wire Mattress Company Ltd onto Harborne Lane were dated 1947. It is known that the premises were destroyed by fire.

Selly Oak is thought to have mechanised the nailing trade using wrought iron.

Map evidence shows that Oak Tree Tannery was established functioning between 1840 and 1884 but as yet there is no indication of when it may have started and when it finished operating.

Sturges Chemical Works founded by John and Edmund Sturge, brothers of the more famous Joseph Sturge, occupied a site in Selly Oak from 1833 to 1853. On the 1839 Tithe Map and apportionments it is described as a vitriol works and yard. The land was owned by Henry Baron and James Rodway.

The brothers founded a company, making dyer’s solutions, at Bewdley in c. 1822. They increased their range of products to citric acid, used in the making of soft drinks, and textile processes as well as other fine chemicals in a highly purified state. After John died Edmund took Arthur Albright into partnership and began making phosphorus at the Selly Oak works.

<text>Sparkbrook is an inner-city area in south-east Birmingham, England. It is one of the four wards forming the Hall Green formal district within Birmingham City Council.

==Etymology==
The area receives its name from Spark Brook, a small stream that flowed south of the city centre. It was later channelled and partially used for a canal.

==Politics==
Sparkbrook ward is represented by two Labour councillors on Birmingham City Council, Mohammed Azim and Shabrana Hussain.

Its former independent councillor, Talib Hussain, was elected as a Liberal Democrat but resigned from the party after being sacked from the council&#x27;s cabinet.

==Geography==
===Project Champion===
Project Champion is a project to install a £3m network of 169 Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to monitor vehicles entering and leaving Sparkbrook and Washwood Heath. Its implementation was frozen in June 2010 amid allegations that the police deliberately misled councillors about its purpose, after it was revealed that it was being funded as an anti-terrorism initiative, rather than for &#x27;reassurance and crime prevention&#x27;. The campaign was spearheaded by a local activist called Steve Jolly, who &#x27;wrote an article for a local magazine, started a petition and lobbied MPs and councillors to denounce the spy-cam scheme&#x27;, he was proactive in contacting the media, it was Steve Jolly who made Paul Lewis of The Guardian aware of this issue. When Paul Lewis wrote his article, it sparked national and international debate on Project Champion, this then led to massive public resistance to Project Champion, which eventually led to it being stopped. West Midlands Police were forced into making an apology. Chief Constable Simms said: 
&quot;I am sorry that we got such an important issue so wrong and deeply sorry that it has had such a negative impact on our communities.&quot;

==Places of interest==
Many of the churches within Sparkbrook were constructed in the late 19th century and early 20th century. One of the most prominent churches in the area is St Agatha&#x27;s Church on the Stratford Road, consecrated in 1901. It is a Grade I listed building.

Christ Church, on the corner of Grantham Road and Dolobran Road, was one of the oldest churches in the area, being consecrated in 1867. The spire belonging to the tower was removed in 1918, and following a bomb blast in World War II, the tower was demolished. In 1927, The Diocesan Home for Girls received a licence permitting public worship within the building. Following damage caused by the Birmingham Tornado 28 July 2005 the church was demolished. However the Christ Church has been rebuilt in 2013 after being destroyed by the tornado in 2005. The Health centre that is on the site of the Christ church has been rebuilt in 2012. 
Consecrated in the same year as St Agatha&#x27;s Church, Emmanuel Church, was a chapel of ease to Christ Church until it received its own parish in 1928. Located within the church is an ancient blank bell from Ullenhall.

Ladypool Road mission hall was opened in 1894 by the Sparkbrook Gospel Mission (founded 1886).

In 1849, a group called the Methodist New Connexion, opened a chapel in the area, their first for 11 years along with a similar chapel on Bridge Street in the city centre.

Lloyd House is a Georgian building situated on Sampson Road. It was built between 1742 and 1752 by Sampson Lloyd, the founder of Lloyds Bank. The building is used as offices by the Bromford Corinthia Housing Association.

In 1780, Sparkbrook was the home of Joseph Priestley, one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry. In 1791, his mansion was partially destroyed in what became known as the Priestley riots. It stood on what is now Priestley Road. 

Sparkbrook is also home of the legendary Farm Park just off of the Stratford Road near Grantham Road.

==Unemployment==
The late 2000s recession resulted in Sparkbrook and Small Heath ward having the eighth highest level of unemployment in Britain in 2009, with 12.9% (more than one in eight) of its residents being registered unemployed. Only Ladywood had a higher rate of unemployment in the West Midlands.

==Demographics==
The 2001 Census recorded that 31,485 people were living in the ward. Sparkbrook has the second highest non-white population in Birmingham, with a total of 78% minority ethnic residents living in the mainly terraced area; notably it is home to a large Somali population. Sparkbrook is also the location of Birmingham&#x27;s &quot;Balti Triangle&quot;, and many of the residents have their own balti businesses.

<text>The Martini–Henry is a breech-loading single-shot rifle with a lever action that was used by the British Army. It first entered service in 1871, eventually replacing the Snider–Enfield, a muzzle-loader converted to the cartridge system. Martini–Henry variants were used throughout the British Empire for 47 years. It combined the dropping-block action first developed by Henry O. Peabody (in his Peabody rifle) and improved by the Swiss designer Friedrich von Martini, combined with the polygonal rifling designed by Scotsman Alexander Henry.

Though the Snider was the first breechloader firing a metallic cartridge in regular British service, the Martini was designed from the outset as a breechloader and was both faster firing and had a longer range.

The Martini–Henry was copied on a large scale by North-West Frontier Province gunsmiths. Their weapons were of a poorer quality than those made by Royal Small Arms Factory, Enfield, but accurately copied down to the proof markings. The chief manufacturers were the Adam Khel Afridi, who lived around the Khyber Pass. The British called such weapons &quot;Pass-made rifles&quot;.

== Overview ==


In the original chambering, the rifles fired a round-nosed, tapered-head .452-inch, soft hollow-based lead bullet, wrapped in a paper patch giving a wider diameter of .460 to .469-inch; it weighed 485 grains. It was crimped in place with two cannelures (grooves on the outside neck of the case), ahead of two fibre card or mill board disks, a concave beeswax wad, another card disk and cotton wool filler. This sat on top of the main powder charge inside initially a rimmed brass foil cartridge, later made in drawn brass.

The cartridge case was paper lined so as to prevent the chemical reaction between the black powder and the brass. Known today as the .577/450, a bottle-neck design with the same base as the .577 cartridge of the Snider–Enfield. It was charged with 85 grains (5.51 g) of Curtis and Harvey&#x27;s No.6 coarse black powder, notorious for its heavy recoil. The cartridge case was ejected to the rear when the lever was operated.

The rifle was long, the steel barrel . The Henry patent rifling produced a heptagonal barrel with seven grooves with one turn in . The weapon weighed . A sword bayonet was standard issue for non-commissioned officers; when fitted, the weapon extended to and weight increased to .

The standard bayonet was a socket-type spike, either converted from the older Pattern 1853 (overall length ) or newly produced as the Pattern 1876 (overall length ), referred to as the &quot;lunger&quot;. A bayonet designed by Lord Elcho was intended for chopping and other sundry non-combat duties, and featured a double row of teeth so it could be used as a saw; it was not produced in great numbers and was not standard issue.

The Mk II Martini–Henry rifle, the most numerous modification adopted in 1877, as used in the Zulu Wars, was sighted to . At , 20 shots exhibited a mean deflection from the centre of the group of , the highest point on the trajectory was at . In 1879, Mk III rifle was adopted, which had minor design updates as well as more interchangeable parts with Martini-Henry carbine.
In late 1870s British military was looking forward to unify ammunition for its rifles and machine guns (they were both .45 caliber, but different cartridges). The .577/.450 turned out to be poorly suited to the hopper feed as well as existing box magazines due to a very pronounced bottleneck, so in 1881 the Gatling cartridge was tried in Martini-Henry rifles. However, in parallel developing a new cartridge with a lighter approximately .4 inch bullet was considered since 1880, and after its design was settled on in 1885 a new variant of the rifle for it was approved in April 1886, designated Enfield Martini .4-inch Pattern A. It incorporated several minor improvements such as a safety catch, was gradually phased in to replace the Martini–Henry with over 21000 produced overall. The replacement was planned to be gradual, to use up existing stocks of the old ammunition. A year later a modified Pattern B was approved with tens of thousands more produced.

However, before this was complete, the decision was made to replace the Martini–Henry rifles with the .303 calibre bolt-action magazine Lee–Metford, which gave a considerably higher maximum rate of fire. Consequently, to avoid having three different rifle calibres in service, the Enfield–Martinis were withdrawn, converted to 0.45 calibre, and renamed Martini–Henry Mk IV &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; pattern rifles. Some 0.303 calibre black-powder carbine versions were also produced, known as the Martini–Metford, and even 0.303 calibre cordite carbines, called Martini–Enfields (the former name for the type of action and the latter name for the pattern of rifling).

During the Martini–Henry&#x27;s service life the British Army was involved in a large number of colonial wars, most notably the Anglo-Zulu War in 1879. The rifle was used in the Battle of Isandlwana, and by the company of the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot at the battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, where 139 British soldiers successfully defended themselves against several thousand Zulus. The weapon was not completely phased out until 1904.

The rifle suffered from cartridge-extraction problems during the Zulu War, mostly due to the thin, weak, pliable foil brass cartridges used: they expanded too much into the rifle&#x27;s chamber on detonation, to the point that they stuck or tore open inside the rifle&#x27;s chamber. It would eventually become difficult to move the breech block and reload the rifle, substantially diminishing its effectiveness, or rendering it useless if the block could not be opened. After investigating the matter, the British Army Ordnance Department determined the fragile construction of the rolled brass cartridge, and fouling due to the black-powder propellant, were the main causes of this problem.

To correct this, the weak rolled brass cartridge was replaced by a stronger drawn brass version, and a longer loading lever was incorporated into the MK-IV to apply greater torque to operate the mechanism when fouled. These later variants were more reliable in battle, although it was not until smokeless nitro powders and copper-jacketed bullets were tried out in these rifles in the 1920s that accuracy and 100% reliability of cartridge case extraction was finally achieved by Birmingham ammunition makers (Kynoch). English hunters on various safaris, mainly in Africa, found the Martini using a cordite charge and a 500-grain full-metal-jacketed bullet effective in stopping large animals such as hippopotamus up to 80 yards away.

The nitro based/shotgun powders were used in Kynoch&#x27;s .577/450 drawn-brass Martini–Henry cartridge cases well into the 1960s for the commercial market, and again were found to be very reliable and, being smokeless, eliminated fouling issues. The powder&#x27;s burning with less pressure inside the cartridge case prevented the brass cases from sticking inside the rifle&#x27;s chamber (because they were not expanding as much as the original black-powder loads did).

The rifle remained a popular competition rifle at National Rifle Association meetings, at Bisley, Surrey, and (NRA) Civilian and Service Rifle matches from 1872 to 1904, where it was used up to 1,000 yards using the standard military service ammunition of the day. By the 1880s the .577/.450 Boxer Henry round was recognised by the NRA as a 900-yard cartridge, as shooting the Martini out to 1,000 yards or ( of a mile) was difficult, and took great skill to assess the correct amount of windage to drop the 485 grain bullet on the target. But by 1904 more target shooters were using the new .303 cal. cartridge, which was found to be much more accurate, and thus interest in the .577/450 fell away, to the point that by 1909 they were rarely used at Bisley matches, with shooters favouring the later Lee–Enfield bolt action magazine rifles.

In 1879, however, it was generally found that in average hands the .577/450 Martini–Henry Mk2, although the most accurate of the Martinis in that calibre ever produced for service life, was really only capable of hitting a man-size target out to 400 yards. This was due to the bullet going subsonic after 300 yards and gradually losing speed thereafter, which in turn affected consistency and accuracy of the bullet in flight. The 415-grain Martini Carbine load introduced in 1878 shot better out to longer ranges and had less recoil when it was fired in the rifles, with its reduced charge of only 75 grains of Curtis &amp; Harvey&#x27;s. It was found that, while the rifle with its 485 grain bullet shot point of aim to 100 yards, the carbine load when fired in the rifles shot high at the same range, but then made up for this by shooting spot-on out to . These early lessons enabled tactics to be evolved to work around the limitations of this large, slow, and heavy calibre during the Zulu War. During most of the key battles, such as Rorke&#x27;s Drift and the Battle of Ulundi, the order to volley fire was not given until the Zulus were at or within 400 yards.

The ballistic performance of a .577/450 is somewhat similar to that of an American .45/70 Government round, as used prolifically throughout the American Frontier West and by buffalo hunters, though the .577/450 has more power due to its extra 15 grains of black powder inside the cartridge case. It is clear from early medical field surgeons&#x27; reports that at 200 yards the rifle really came into its own, and inflicted devastating and horrific wounds on the Zulus in the Anglo–Zulu War. The MK2 Martini&#x27;s sights are marked to 1,800 yards, but this setting was only ever used for long-range mass volley firing to harass an artillery position or a known massed cavalry position, prior to a main fight, and to prevent or delay infantry attacks. A similar &quot;drop volley sight&quot; whereby the rifle&#x27;s bullets were dropped long range onto the target was employed on the later .303 Lee–Enfield rifles of WW1, which had a graduation lever sight calibrated up to 2,800 yards.

The Nepalese produced a close copy of the British Martini–Henry incorporating certain Westley Richards improvements to the trigger mechanism but otherwise very similar to the British Mark II. These rifles can be identified by their Nepalese markings and different receiver ring. A noticeably different variant incorporating earlier Westley Richards ideas for a flat-spring driven hammer within the receiver in lieu of the coil-spring powered striker of the von Martini design, known as the Gahendra rifle, was produced locally in Nepal. While generally well-made, the rifles were produced substantially by hand, making the quality extremely variable. Though efforts were being made to phase out these rifles, presumably by the 1890s, some 9000 were still in service in 1906.

The Martini–Henry saw service in World War I in a variety of roles, primarily as a Reserve Arm, but it was also issued (in the early stages of the war) to aircrew for attacking observation balloons with newly developed incendiary ammunition, and aircraft. Martini–Henrys were also used in the African and Middle Eastern theatres during World War I, in the hands of Native Auxiliary troops.

=== Greener shotgun ===
A shotgun variant known as the &quot;Greener Police Gun&quot;, &quot;Greener EG&quot; (for &quot;Egyptian Government&quot;), or the &quot;Greener Prison Shotgun&quot; was chambered in a 14.5-gauge -inch (18×73mm) full-length brass shell used only by this gun. That would make the weapon useless to anyone who stole it, as no other cartridge could be loaded. It was used by prison guards and police in Egypt, Burma, India, and Australia. Over 60,000 had been produced by the time production ended in the 1960s.

The gun was originally designed to replace the Egyptian police&#x27;s obsolete Martini–Henry rifles, which they usually loaded with brass shot-shells. The Mark I/14 (&quot;14&quot; for the gun&#x27;s gauge), first produced in 1918, had a full wooden stock and a large metal nosecap over the muzzle. The Mark II/14 lacked the nosecap and had a full hunting-style stock. It was discovered that criminals in Egypt were jury-rigging shotguns they had captured or stolen by wrapping common civilian 16-gauge shells with thick paper to allow them to fit the bore. Greener responded in 1932 by coming up with a redesigned gun and new shell design to prevent this. The Mark III/14 Shotgun had a three-pronged firing pin and its cartridge had a unique recessed primer well (much like that of the Lebel rifle) to prevent the firing of standard shells. The cartridge also had a bottle-necked tapered wall and corresponding shotgun breech that would prevent the insertion of other shells. In addition to the cocking indicators found on military Martini-Henry rifles, the Police Gun features a safety lever that automatically engages when cocked.

An example can be seen at the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds.

Greener also used the Martini action for the GP (&quot;General Purpose&quot;) single-barreled shotgun firing standard 12-bore or -inch ammunition, which was a staple for gamekeepers and rough shooters in Britain. The GP was built from 1922 to 1964 by W. W. Greener, and from 1965 to the 1980s by Webley &amp; Scott. The front end of the receiver is split and the barrel is secured via a takedown screw, which enables the barrel to be removed by rotating it 90 degrees after loosening the screw. Unlike the Martini-Henry or the EG, the GP does not feature a cocking indicator but retains the automatic safety. 

Two models of the GP was produced, Mark I and II, with the only major exterior difference being a bulkier safety lever and reversing the takedown screw&#x27;s orientation. Internally, the Mark II employs circlips to retain various pins instead of keeper screws, and as a result the internals are not interchangeable with the Mark I due to the design change done to accommodate the circlips. As the receivers were made in batches and assembled at a later date, it is not unusual to find an earlier serial block receiver mated to a barrel exhibiting more modern proof markings. By default, the GP is offered with a standard 12-bore (.729&quot; or 18.52mm) barrel with a fixed, full choke (.035&quot; or 0.889mm constriction), but other bore/choke configurations such as .719&quot; (18.26mm) barrels are available upon request. Barrel lengths vary from 26&quot; to 32&quot; and other features such as slings and checkering are optional extras.

===Greener harpoon gun===
W. W. Greener also used the Martini action to produce the Greener-Martini Light Harpoon Gun used for whaling, and also for commercial harvest of tuna and other large fish. The gun fired a .38 blank cartridge to propel the harpoon. A special barrel—effectively a hollow tube that acted as a spigot—and stock were fitted to accommodate the harpoon and to lower weight.

===Ottoman, Romanian, and Boer Republics Peabody–Martini–Henry rifles===
Unable to purchase Martini–Henry rifles from the British because their entire production was going to rearming British troops, The Ottoman Empire purchased weapons identical to the Mark I from the Providence Tool Company in Providence, Rhode Island, United States (the manufacturers of the somewhat similar Peabody rifle), and used them effectively against the Russians in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878). Ottoman outlaws and folk heroes such as Hekimoğlu famously used the rifle during his raids on landowners. The rifle is referred to as &quot;Aynalı Martin&quot; in the Ottoman Empire and is featured in several famous folk songs.
Beginning in 1879, Romania decided to replace its old model 1867 Peabody rifles with the Martini–Henry rifles. An order was made to Steyr for 130,000 rifles which were delivered into the early 1880s. These rifles were also used in the First World War, with 142,906 rifles and 8,724 carbines being registered in service on 15 August 1916.

Significant numbers of the basic design, with variations, were also produced for the Boer Republics, both in Belgium and, via Westley Richards, in Birmingham, as late as the late 1890s. During the Second Boer War, many of the Boers used the Martini–Henry rifle, since over 34,000 of these had been purchased.

==Operation of the Martini action==

The lock and breech are held to the stock by a metal bolt (A). The breech is closed by the block (B) which turns on the pin (C) that passes through the rear of the block. The end of the block is rounded to form a knuckle joint with the back of the case (D) which receives the force of the recoil rather than the pin (C).

Below the trigger-guard the lever (E) works a pin (F) which projects the tumbler (G) into the case. The tumbler moves within a notch (H) and acts upon the block, raising it into the firing position or allowing it to fall according to the position of the lever.

The block (B) is hollowed along its upper surface (I) to assist in inserting a cartridge into the firing chamber (J). To fire the cartridge the block is raised to position the firing mechanism (K) against the cartridge. The firing mechanism consists of a helical spring around a pointed metal striker, the tip of which passes through a hole in the face of the block to impact the percussion-cap of the inserted cartridge. As the lever (E) is moved forward the tumbler (G) revolves and one of its arms engages and draws back the spring until the tumbler is firmly locked in the notch (H) and the spring is held by the rest-piece (L) which is pushed into a bend in the lower part of the tumbler.

After firing, the cartridge is partially extracted by the lock. The extractor rotates on a pin (M) and has two vertical arms (N), which are pressed by the rim of the cartridge pushed home into two grooves in the sides of the barrel. A bent arm (O), forming an 80° angle with the extractor arms, is forced down by the dropping block when the lever is pushed forward, so causing the upright arms to extract the cartridge case slightly and allow easier manual full extraction.

As well as British service rifles, the Martini breech action was applied to shotguns by the Greener company of Britain, whose single-shot &quot;EP&quot; riot guns were still in service in the 1970s in former British colonies. The Greener &quot;GP&quot; shotgun, also using the Martini action, was a favourite rough-shooting gun in the mid-20th century. The Martini action was used by BSA and latterly BSA/Parker Hale for their series of &quot;Small Action Martini&quot; small bore target rifles that were in production until 1955.

*: There were four main marks of the Martini–Henry rifle produced: Mark I (released in June 1871), Mark II, Mark III, and Mark IV. There was also an 1877 carbine version with variations that included a Garrison Artillery Carbine, an Artillery Carbine (Mark I, Mark II, and Mark III), and smaller versions designed as training rifles for military cadets. The Mark IV Martini–Henry rifle ended production in 1889, replaced by the Lee–Metford, but it remained in service throughout the British Empire until the end of the First World War.

<text>Acocks Green is a suburban area and ward of southeast Birmingham, England. It is named after the Acock family, who built a large house there in 1370. It is occasionally spelled &quot;Acock&#x27;s Green&quot;. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names.

Stockfield in the north of the ward was once a separate village. It merged with Acocks Green after housing development in the 20th century. The 2021 census gives a population of 24,500 for Acocks Green ward. The ward covers an area of . 

==History==
Acocks Green developed north of the current centre at the roundabout where the Warwick Road meets Shirley and Westley Roads. This area was known as &quot;Tenchlee&quot; or &quot;Tenelea&quot;, meaning &#x27;ten clearings&#x27;. The settlement that developed here has completely disappeared. Hyron Hall and Broom Hall were moated manor houses in the area. The Fox Hollies name derives from the time the Fox family bought the farm belonging to the atte Holies in the 15th century. The earliest known reference to Acocks Green is in the Yardley Parish Register of 1604. In 1626, Acocks Green House and other estates were given by Richard Acock to his son as a wedding gift. In 1725, the Warwick Road was turnpiked. At the end of the 18th century, the Warwick and Birmingham Canal was cut through the northern edge of Acocks Green, with wharves being constructed at Stockfield Road and Yardley Road. The increased prosperity brought by the canal led to the construction of farms and large residences.

Acocks Green began to expand following the opening of the Birmingham to Oxford Railway in 1852. At this time there were three hamlets along the Warwick Road; Flint Green, Acocks Green, and Westley Brook. As the hamlet of Acocks Green was closer to the railway station it developed faster than the others. Westley Brook became the centre of modern Acocks Green.

In 1911, the parish of Yardley, of which Acocks Green was a part, was absorbed into Birmingham. Birmingham was in need of housing and in the mid-1920s, municipal housing was built on the fields surrounding Acocks Green, resulting in a large increase in the population. Many new residents were unwelcome and existing residents moved away leading to the nickname &quot;Snobs Green&quot;. Acocks Green benefited from an increase in commerce brought about by the newcomers. It developed into a major shopping area and churches and meeting halls were extended to accommodate more people.

Trams arrived in Acocks Green in 1916, first terminating at Broad Road before reaching The Green in 1922. The centre of Acocks Green was remodelled in 1932, and a large island incorporating the tram terminus was created. After the tram service ended, the island was grassed over.

Acocks Green was the location for a custom-built factory which made parts for the Bristol Hercules radial engines. Construction of the factory commenced in late 1936 on the site of Westwood&#x27;s market gardening business near the canal. The factory was the Rover shadow factory and it was operational by July 1937. The factory was visited by King George VI in March 1938. Towards the end of World War II, the factory began to produce Meteor tank engines and the Meteorite engine, and thus became a target for German bombers.

=== The Stockfield Estate ===

The Stockfield Estate was one of Birmingham&#x27;s many interwar housing estates built by the city council during the 1920s and 1930s to rehouse people from inner-city slums. The houses proved popular thanks to the inclusion of electricity, running water, indoor toilets, bathrooms and gardens. The houses, constructed from concrete and designed in the &#x27;Parkinson&#x27; style, were declared defective by law in 1985 and structural tests concluded that damage was so severe that repair would not be possible. This meant that the 477 houses had to be demolished, however, Birmingham City Council did not have the financial services available to carry out the work. Residents of the estate set up an Estate Development Group and architects Webb Seeger Moorhouse were invited to prepare a masterplan for the estate. The masterplan and the proposal to establish a community association were publicly announced in October 1989. Residents unanimously approved the plans. Stockfield Community Association was formed in 1991 and a redevelopment partnership was then formed between the Community Association, Birmingham City Council, Halifax Building Society and Bromford Carinthia Housing Association, with Anthony Collins Solicitors and Webb Seeger Moorhouse Community Architects giving support. Wimpey Homes were appointed developers and work on the first phase of the estate commenced in July 1991. This was met with opposition from some residents refusing to move and the crime on the estate was so bad that the washing machine in the show home provided by Wimpey was stolen. The first phase, saw 17 Bromford family homes for rent, opened in the summer of 1991 by the Lord Mayor of Birmingham. By 1998, all four phases of the estate were completed.

==History==
=== 12th-13th centuries ===
The first written reference to Varaždin, whose historical name is Garestin, was on 20 August 1181, when King Béla III mentioned the nearby thermal springs (Varaždinske Toplice) in a legal document.

Varaždin was declared a free royal borough in 1209 by the Hungarian King Andrew II. The town became the economic and military centre of northern Croatia. Due to Ottoman raids, the town was structured defensively around the old fortress, and acquired the shape of a typical medieval Wasserburg. In the early 13th century, the Knights Hospitaller () came to Varaždin, where they built the church and a monastery. Mid 13th century, the church of St. John belonging to the Hospitallers was taken over by Franciscans, who extended it over several centuries, eventually replacing the medieval structures with early baroque.

=== 14th-15th centuries ===
At the end of the 14th century, Varaždin fortress passed to the hands of the Counts of Celje. Over the following centuries Varaždin had several owners, the most influential being Beatrice Frankopan (1480–1510), wife of Margrave Georg of Brandenburg-Ansbach, who built the town hall; her successor was Baron Ivan Ungnad (1493–1564), who reinforced the existing fortification. At the end of the 16th century Count Thomas Erdődy became its owner, assuming the hereditary position of Varaždin prefects (župan), and the fortress remained in the ownership of the Erdődy family until 1925.

=== 16th-17th centuries ===
The town was the seat of Slavonnian Military Border in late 16th century.

; Destructions by fires and fire fighting measures
16th century is also the beginning of fires being recorded; starting with a fire in Varaždin in 1558, although no details are given. 
We know more about the great fire of May 27, 1582, that had such dire effects that the Varaždin population counted time as &quot;prior&quot; and &quot;after the Great fire&quot;. The losses include the parish church, the Franciscan church and a friary (subsequently the Franciscans left Varaždin), the chapels of St. Vid, Michael and Holy Trinity, the homes of the local tollhouse clerks and customs officers. The stronghold was spared but the fire jumped the city walls and ravaged the suburbs close to the river Drava. The citizens asked the king for help and were granted state tax exoneration for the following six years by the Hungarian royal chamber, relieved from tax duty for one year and were assigned free serf labor. Austrian archduke Ernest wrote to Varaždin County officials on July 9, 1582 to provide free lumber for the citizens who had lost their homes in the fire. That fire prompted authorities, not only in Varaždin but also in other towns, to set up watch posts with guards on lookout for possible fire.

A fire on April 29, 1586, burned down a number of buildings. The following year, 1587, saw two fires: one on May 10 that burned 23 homes in the Royal street, and one on December 26 that burned only one home. At that time, Varaždin, contrary to some other towns, did not have any organized fire-fighting service. The next fire recorded, in 1592, brings in the town protocol the description of «pitiful and grieving town of Varaždin»; among the damages are noted that of several public buildings, including the town hall and St. Nicholas church. Another fire in 1599 destroyed 66 buildings in and around the street of St.Vid. 1599 also sees the town officials take the first fire fighting measures. This ordnance seems to have had some effect, as the next recorded fire dates from mid-17th century.

The great fire of 1646, that destroyed more than half the town and damaged many of the remaining buildings, did not deter the town&#x27;s growth, as better buildings replaced the &quot;ugly town district&quot;.
Sigismund Trautmanstorf(de), a member of Austria&#x27;s nobility, reports a fire on May 1, 1648, fuelled by high wind, that destroyed more than a half the town within its walls - several hundred of houses disappeared. The town magistrate asked King Ferdinand III to relieve the town from Royal chamber taxes, due
to the current devastation; the king granted that request and on 27 October 1649 he pardoned the town from paying overdue taxes of 500 Hungarian forint, with the specific reason of «half of Varaždin perishing in the fire of 1 May 1648».

On Easter Monday of March 27, 1665, an extremely large fire started in Brodovski konec suburb (E-N-E of Varaždin) and, due to a strong wind, crossed the town walls and spread all over town. It destroyed Varaždin churches (parish church, Jesuit church and Franciscan church), spared only eight homes and new stables belonging to Varaždin stronghold&#x27;s military commander; it also destroyed several towers from the town walls, albeit sparing the one used as main armoury - a lucky escape, as that one held the gunpowder magazine; thus sparing some lives. Beside the inner town buildings, the entire suburb outside the upper gates was also destroyed in the fire, from the east all the way to the stronghold&#x27;s toll gates; this included part of the main street and Vidovski konec street, toward Biškupec village (about 3 km south of Varaždin); the next day the fire caught Vidovski konec and burned all its buildings down. 
St. Florian&#x27;s chapel was built in Varaždin in 1669, as a votive chapel after the 1665 fire (catholic patron saint St. Florian was believed to protect from fires, thus has many dedicated chapels and churches - such as that in Koprivnica, first mentioned in 1680, or in Križevci after their fire in 1735).

Fires in the 18th century include that of 1745, set up by soldiers spiteful of their lodgers, which destroyed a number of homes and a brewery. 
In 1748 another fire destroyed much of the southern suburbs, including 119 homes and several hundred stables and barns.

In 1767, the Croatian Royal Council - newly installed in town - gave order to the Varaždin town authorities to uphold restriction on drying flax and hemp fiber on house stoves, on smoking around barns and stables, and on replacing wooden chimneys by brick-built ones, the latter an expensive task: 1768 records show that that concerned most of Varaždin&#x27;s chimneys, a fire hazard compounded by that the people hardly ever cleaned them. In 1755, Varaždin had only one chimneysweeper, not even paid on a regular basis. The presence of the country&#x27;s gouvernment in town somewhat changed the attitude towards fire. For example, upon another fire in 1769, there were records of efficiency in putting out the fire. Members of the town&#x27;s administration showing up at fire sight were to take charge of the operation, duties were assigned to firefighters and their performance monitored.

A record from 1771 mentions 32 buildings and many stables and barns destroyed by fire. 
That year, the Hungarian Chamber representative proposed to the town authorities to help those who lost homes in fire rebuild in bricks and setting up stoves outside their houses - not only in Varaždin town center, but also further in the town outskirts. Thus in 1774, the Hungarian chamber demanded from Varaždin town authorities that burned-down homes of Sračinec village be replaced with raw brick buildings. Morever, in 1767 the town owned only one water-sprinkling device with a two- to three bucket capacity; in 1772 Queen Maria Theresa issued an ordnance listing necessary equipment that the town&#x27;s authorities had to purchase for fire-fighting, and by 1773, the town owned most of this equipment. In 1771, Varaždin authorities made fire-fighting compulsory for all citizens.

But this did not spare the town from its next big fire, that of April 25–26, 1776. It started in the Sračinec suburb (west of Varaždin) and, again due to strong wind - and the carelessness of a merchant who had stashed gunpowder in his house, which exploded and added fuel to the fire -, spread to Varaždin. Of the 113 buildings held within its walls, 70 were entirely destroyed and 11 partially destroyed; the northern suburb had held 256 buildings, of which 111 were entirely destroyed; and of the 245 homes in the southern suburb, 135 were destroyed : altogether, from the total of 614 homes, 316 were destroyed - more than half. Most of the nobility fled the town, and with it the country&#x27;s government so recently installed there. But the commoners (primarily merchants and artisans) remained - and turned their town into one huge building site: by 1780 the number of homes equaled that prior to the fire. 
After that fire, the town authorities decreed a public prohibition of wooden houses inside the town walls; even more specifically, brickmade chimneys became compulsory. The authorities ensured that adequate building materials were available. A committee was set up to inspect all chimneys and list down those which were fire hazards. Incentives were set up too, rewarding those citizens who were first to help in fire fighting; in the 18th century, there were public citations for citizens who showed up at fires with fire-fighting sprinkling equipment, as well as those who arrived on site with large amounts of water to put out fire. Later, fire insurance policies were set up with insurance companies.

In spite of all those set-backs, the 17th and 18th centuries saw Varaždin&#x27;s economy and culture expand ; within that period it grew from around 3,000 inhabitants around the year 1600 to around 5,500 inhabitants by the end of the 18th century.

; Varaždin capital of Croatia... for a short time
In 1756 or 1766, the Ban Ferenc Nádasdy chose Varaždin as his official residence, and Varaždin became the capital of all of Croatia. It hosted the Croatian Sabor and the Royal Croatian Council founded by Empress Maria Theresa.

The April 1776 fire put an end to that presence in town.

; Post-capital
The periods of the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation had a great influence on Varaždin. With the arrival of the Jesuits, the school (gymnasium) and the Jesuit house were founded, and churches and other buildings were built in the Baroque style. In the 18th century Varaždin was the seat of many Croatian noblemen, and in 1756 it became the Croatian administrative centre. The fire of 1776 destroyed some 80% of the town, resulting in the administrative institutions moving back to Zagreb.

=== 19th century ===
Varaždin was the seat of Varaždin County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, ruled by the Kingdom of Hungary after the compromise of 1867. The Hungarian stamp, issued in 1881 shows both names.

By the 19th century Varaždin had been completely rebuilt and expanded, with flourishing crafts and trade, and later the manufacture of silk and bricks. The theatre and the music school were founded. From the second half of 19th century, fire fighting was organized and specialized fire-fighting societies were established; the very first fire fighting volunteers in Croato-Slavonnian Kingdom was organized in Varaždin in 1864.

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century Varaždin developed into the industrial centre of northwestern Croatia. The textile manufacturer &quot;Tivar&quot; was founded in 1918. A silk factory was started in 1929, the one which would later start the sportswear brand YASSA.

Under the leadership of professor Krešimir Filić, the town developed a city library, a city museum, a gallery, reopened its music school, and had a mountaineering society started.

Soon after the start of World War II in Yugoslavia, on 12 July 1941, Varaždin was declared &quot;Judenfrei&quot; by the Ustaše, becoming the first city in Croatia to earn this dubious distinction.

The former village of Biškupec, whose population was tracked as a separate settlement between 1857 and 1948, when it reached 635 inhabitants, was integrated into the city of Varaždin since the 1953 census.

In the Croatian War of Independence, 1991, Varaždin suffered directly for only for a few days, because the huge Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army base quickly surrendered after the Siege of Varaždin Barracks, resulting in a minimal number of casualties, and providing weapons (worth $600m) for the Croatian army.

==Monuments and sights==
Varaždin represents the best preserved and richest urban complex in continental Croatia. It aims for a Unesco listing as a World Heritage Site.

The Old Town (fortress) is an example of medieval defensive buildings. Construction began in the 14th century, and in the following century the rounded towers, typical of Gothic architecture in Croatia, were added. Today it houses the Town Museum. The fortress was depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2001.

The Old and Contemporary Masters Gallery is located in the Sermage Palace, built in the rococo style in 1750.

In 1523, Margrave Georg of Brandenburg built the town hall in late baroque style, with the Varaždin coat of arms at the foot of the tower, and it has continued in its function until the present day. There is a guard-changing ceremony every Saturday.

Varaždin&#x27;s Cathedral, a former Jesuit church, was built in 1647, and is distinguished by its baroque entrance, eighteenth-century altar, and paintings.

There are many baroque and rococo palaces and houses in the town. Worth particular mention is Varaždin&#x27;s Croatian National Theatre, built in 1873 and designed by the Viennese architects Herman Helmer and Ferdinand Fellner.

A baroque music festival has been held annually in Varaždin since 1971, and attracts some of the finest musicians and their fans from Croatia and the world. Recommended to visitors is also the historical street festival &quot;Špancir fest&quot; every August.

The city features its old city guard, named Purgari, in various city ceremonies as well as the weekly ceremony of the &#x27;change of the guards&#x27; in front of the city hall. Additionally, Varaždin police officers patrol on bicycles in the warmer months.

===The Old Town (Stari Grad)===
The Old Town keep is one of the biggest monuments in the city of Varaždin and one of its biggest tourist attractions. It is located in the north-western section of the city core. Today the keep houses the Varaždin City Museum.

The keep is first mentioned in the 12th century and it is believed to be the center of Varaždin county life. The keep underwent numerous ownership changes and reconstructions over the centuries. The Old Town was featured on the now defunct 5 Kuna bill.

===Churches and monasteries===


===Baroque palaces===
===Varaždin cemetery===
The cemetery dates back to 1773 and it was long time an ordinary place until 1905, when Herman Haller had an idea to make it more park-like with large trees and alleys for citizens to stroll through. The reconstruction of the cemetery was done between 1905 and 1947, and its current landscape and architecture dates from these works, It is now a protected cultural and natural park.

<doc id="663225" wikidata="Q707575" url="?curid=663225" title="Tạ Thu Thâu">
<text>Tạ Thu Thâu (1906–1945) in the 1930s was the principal representative of Trotskyism in Vietnam and, in colonial Cochinchina, of left opposition to the Indochinese Communist Party (PCI) of Nguyen Ai Quoc (Ho Chi Minh). He joined to Left Opposition to the United Front policy of the Commintern as a student in Paris in the late 1920s. After a period of uneasy co-operation with &quot;Stalinists&quot; on the Saigon paper , he triumphed over the Communists in the 1939 elections to the Cochinchina Colonial Council on a platform that called for radical land reform and workers&#x27; control, and opposed defense collaboration with the French authorities. He was executed by the Communist Viet Minh in September 1945.

==Early life==
Tạ Thu Thâu was born in 1906 in Tân Bình, An Phú, (near Long Xuyên) in the French colony of Cochinchina (southern Vietnam), the fourth child of a large and very poor family: his father was an itinerant carpenter. As a scholar student he attended a high school in Saigon, and (with a ) in 1925 began work as a teacher. In 1926, at age 20 he joined the &quot;Jeune Annam&quot; (Young Annam), and wrote for the nationalist newspaper &quot;Annam.&quot; In April Thâu took part in a week of protests attended by thousands of workers, and by students, sparked by the death, after 18 years penal servitude, of the veteran nationalist Phan Châu Trinh and by the arrest of Nguyễn An Ninh.

Nguyễn An Ninh was an important influence on Thâu. From the pages of his journal (from Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Broken Bell&quot;), Ninh exhorted young people to &quot;leave the home of their fathers.&quot; Only then could they hope to shake off the &quot;suffocating ignorance&quot; in which they were trapped by obscurantism: &quot;our oppression comes from France, but so does the spirit of liberation.&quot; In 1927 Thâu sailed for France, where he enrolled in the Faculty of Science, University of Paris.

==&quot;Nationalism or Socialism&quot;, Paris 1927–1930==

Tạ Thu Thâu clashed with Moscow-aligned Communists from the very outset of his political engagement in Paris as a member, and from early 1928 as the leader, of the Annamite Independence Party (). He accused &quot;salaried Annamites of the Colonial Commission of the French Communist Party&quot; of infiltrating his party in order to turn members into &quot;puppets carrying out the Communist Party&#x27;s dictates.&quot; If the oppressed of the colonies were to secure their &quot;place in the sun,&quot; Thâu argued they would have to &quot;unite against European imperialism-against Red imperialism as well as White.&quot;

In 1929, after attending a conference of the Anti-Imperialist World Congress in Frankfurt, Germany, and contact with the philosopher and human rights activist, Felicien Challey, and the Communist Party dissidents Alfred Rosmer and Daniel Guérin, Thâu expressed his view of the Indo-Chinese revolution in the Left Opposition . The revolution would not follow the precedent set by the Third International in China, where support for a broad nationalist front, the Kuomintang, had led Communists &quot;to the graveyard.&quot; The &quot;&#x27;Sun Yat-sen-ist&#x27; synthesis of democracy, nationalism and socialism&quot; is &quot;a kind of nationalist mysticism.&quot; It obscures &quot;the concrete class relationships, and the real, organic liaison between the indigenous bourgeoisie and French imperialism,&quot; in the light of which the call for independence is &quot;mechanical and formalistic.&quot; &quot;A revolution based on the organisation of the proletarian and peasant masses is the only one capable of liberating the colonies ... The question of independence must be bound up with that of the proletarian socialist revolution.&quot;

Arrested during a public protest in front of the Élysée Palace over the execution of the leaders of the Yên Bái mutiny on 22 May 1930, Thâu and eighteen of his compatriots were deported back to Saigon.

==&quot;The Struggle&quot; in Saigon, 1930-1939==
Tạ Thu Thâu&#x27;s first attempt to challenge to the Indochinese Communist Party (PCI) from the left, the Indochinese Communism Union (), was broken up in 1932 with his arrest. On his release early in 1933 Thâu decided to explore the limited opportunities for &quot;legal&quot; political activity. To the surprise of some of his comrades, for this purpose he was willing to work not only with independent nationalists but also with &quot;Stalinists&quot;—with members of the PCI.

The focus for cooperation was the spring 1933 elections Saigon municipal elections. Thâu and his associates put forward a &quot;Workers&#x27;s List&quot; and briefly published a newspaper (in French to get around the political restrictions on Vietnamese), (The Struggle) to rally support for it. In spite of the restricted franchise, two of this Struggle group were elected (although denied their seats), the independent nationalist (later Trotskyist) Tran Van Thach and Nguyễn Văn Tạo, previously a member of the French Communist Party (PCF), now in the PCI.

In the autumn of 1934, partly through the intercession of Nguyễn An Ninh, the Struggle Group was revived with being published as a regular weekly. In March 1935 Cochinchina Council elections their united &quot;Worker&#x27;s List&quot; won no seats but 17 percent of the vote.

Those unwilling to accept the accommodations involved in this unique Trotskyist-Stalinist entente rallied to the League of Internationalist Communists for the Construction of the Fourth International (). The die hards included Ngô Văn (Ngô Văn Xuyết), who in later exile was to memorialise Tạ Thu Thâu in his history of the revolutionary struggle.

Tạ Thu Thâu and Nguyễn Văn Tạo came together for the last time in the April 1937 city council elections, both being elected. Together with the lengthening shadow of the Moscow Trials, their growing disagreements over the new PCF-supported Popular Front government in France ensured a split.

The leftward shift in the French National Assembly in Thâu&#x27;s view had brought little. He and his comrades continued to be arrested during labour strikes, and preparations for a popular congress in response to the government&#x27;s promise of colonial consultation had been suppressed. Colonial Minister Marius Moutet, a Socialist commented that he had sought &quot;a wide consultation with all elements of the popular [will],&quot; but with &quot;Trotskyist-Communists intervening in the villages to menace and intimidate the peasant part of the population, taking all authority from the public officials,&quot; the necessary &quot;formula&quot; had not been found.

Thâu&#x27;s motion attacking the Popular Front for betraying the promises of reforms in the colonies was rejected by the PCI faction and the Stalinists withdrew from . They established their own paper, , in which they denounced their erstwhile Trotskyist colleagues as &quot;the twin brothers of fascism.&quot;

With now as (Struggle) an openly Trotskyist paper, Thâu and Phan Văn Hùm led a &quot;Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Slate&quot; into victory over both the Constitutionalists and the PCI&#x27;s Democratic Front in the April 1939 Cochinchina Council elections. The &quot;lutteurs&quot; programme had been openly revolutionary (radical land redistribution, workers control). But the key was their opposition to the &quot;national defence levy&quot; that the Communist Party, in the spirit of Franco-Soviet accord, had felt obliged to support.

On May 20, 1939, Governor-General Brévié (who set the election results aside) wrote to Colonial Minister Mandel: &quot;the Trotskyists under the leadership of Ta Thu Thau, want to take advantage of a possible war in order to win total liberation.&quot; The Stalinists, on the other hand, are &quot;following the position of the Communist Party in France&quot; and &quot;will thus be loyal if war breaks out.&quot;

Such as it was, the political opening against the PCI closed with the Hitler-Stalin Pact of August 23, 1939. Moscow ordered a return to direct confrontation with the French. In Cochinchina the Party in 1940 obliged, triggering a disastrous peasant revolt.

Belatedly, the &quot;Luttuers&quot;, then numbering then perhaps 3000, and the smaller number of Octobrists united as the official section of the newly constituted Fourth International. They formed the International Communist League (Vietnam) (ICL), or less formally as The Fourth Internationalist Party (&quot;Trang Cau De Tu Dang&quot;).

With the outbreak of World War II, Communists of every stripe were repressed. The French law of September 26, 1939, which legally dissolved the French Communist Party, was applied in Indochina to Stalinists and Trotskyists alike. Tạ Thu Thâu was arrested and was incarcerated in the penal colony Poulo-Condore. He was held until March 1945 when the occupying Japanese finally dispensed with the Vichy French administration.

==Northern mission, arrest and execution 1945==
While Tạ Thu Thâu was in Poulo-Condore, in Tonkin, Nguyen Ai Quoc, now known as Hồ Chí Minh, was laying the foundations for national power. He created the Viet Minh (&quot;Viet Nam doc lap dong minh hoi&quot;—-Vietnam Independence League). A purportedly broad nationalist front, the Viet Minh remained (in contrast to the Chinese &quot;Kuomintang&quot;) entirely a creature of the Party (even after this was formally dissolved in 1945). Subordinating all other social interests, the objective was &quot;To expel the French and Japanese fascists and to establish the complete independence of Vietnam.&quot;

On his release from Poulo-Condore, Ngô Văn records that Thâu and a small group secretly travelled north to Tonkin. They encountered a fraternal group publishing a bulletin, (Combat) and were received into clandestine meetings of mine workers and peasants. But famine was rife. On May 14 he managed to get an appeal published in the daily &quot;Saigon&quot;. He called on his &quot;brothers in Cochinchina to eat only what you need to stay alive and to send here everything you possibly can, immediately. His young comrade, Ðỗ Bá Thế, drew on their northern mission in his 1960 novel, (&quot;The Good Auntie&quot;).

In August, hunted and pursued as &quot;anti-worker elements&quot; by the Viet Minh, Thâu and his group turned south. On September 14, at Quang Ngai, he fell into their hands. There were reports that Thau was put on trial before a &quot;people’s court&quot;, but that on the personal instruction of Hồ, Tran Van Giau, of the southern Viet Minh command, overrode the court when it refused to convict Thau, and had him summarily executed. His fate was shared at Quang Ngai by large numbers of Caodaists, independent nationalists and their families. Interviewed in 1989, Giau, who allowed that he had known Thâu since their days in Paris and been helped by him when on the run from the in Saigon, refused to answer questions about the fate of Trotskyists at the hand of the &quot;Viet Minh&quot; and denied any connection to Thâu&#x27;s death.

In September, during the general uprising in Saigon against the restoration of the French, Thâu&#x27;s reconvened grouping formed a workers&#x27; militia. Of these, Ngô Văn records two hundred alone being &quot;massacred&quot; by the French, on October 3, at the Thị Nghè bridge. Caught between the French and the Viet Minh, there were few survivors.

A year later in Paris, Daniel Guerin asked Ho Chi Minh about Tạ Thu Thâu&#x27;s fate. Hồ Chí Minh had replied, &quot;with unfeigned emotion,&quot; that &quot;Thâu was a great patriot and we mourn him&quot;, but then a moment later added in a steady voice, &quot;All those who do not follow the line which I have laid down will be broken.&quot;

== Commemoration in South Vietnam ==
Up until the capitulation of the South Vietnamese regime to the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam and the National Liberation Front in April 1975, streets in a number of southern towns and cities were named in honor of Tạ Thu Thâu. From March 22, 1955, these included the street leading to the East Gate of Bến Thành Market in old Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City, which now bears the name of the &quot;patriotic intellectual&quot; Lưu Văn Lang. There is, however, a small street in District 9 of the city, near the Thu Duc intersection, that continues as .

The year before the fall of Saigon, in January 1974 a biography of Tạ Thu Thâu, &quot;Nhà cách mạng Tạ Thu Thâu, 1906-1945&quot; (The Revolutionary Tạ Thu Thâu), was published in the city written by Phương Lan.

Thâu had a wife who died in Paris in 2010 at the age of 101.

<doc id="663227" wikidata="Q8026681" url="?curid=663227" title="Wipeout (1988 game show)">
<text>Wipeout is an American game show. Contestants competed to eliminate correct answers to trivia questions from a game board without eliminating incorrect answers, known as &quot;wipeout&quot;s. It aired from September 12, 1988, to June 9, 1989, with Peter Tomarken as host. The series was produced by Dames-Fraser Productions, and was distributed in first-run syndication by Paramount Domestic Television.

==Main game==

===First round===
Three contestants competed on each episode. Initially, each game featured three new contestants. After several weeks, a returning champion and two new contestants competed.

The contestants were given a category and shown 16 possible answers on a four-by-four grid of monitors. Eleven answers were correct, while the five incorrect ones were referred to as &quot;wipeouts&quot;. The contestant in the leftmost position began the round. The contestant in control chose one answer at a time; each correct answer awarded money, while finding a wipeout reset the score to zero and ended his/her turn. After each correct answer, the contestant could either choose again or pass control to the next contestant. The first correct answer of the round was worth $25, and the value of each subsequent answer increased by $25, with the last one worth $275.

The round ended once all eleven correct answers were found or if all five wipeouts had been selected. The two contestants with the highest money totals kept their earnings and continued on, while the third place contestant left with consolation prizes. If there was a tie for low score, the tied contestants were given a new category and shown 12 answers (eight correct, four wipeouts). They alternated choosing one answer at a time, with a coin toss to decide who would start, and the first contestant to find a wipeout was eliminated. If all eight correct answers were found, the contestant who gave the last one advanced.

One of the eleven correct answers was referred to as the &quot;Hot Spot&quot;, with a bonus prize attached to it. Once the Hot Spot was uncovered, Tomarken would take a token from inside his podium and place it on the desk of the contestant that found it. In order to win the Hot Spot prize, a contestant had to both be in possession of the token at the end of the round and have a high enough score to advance to the Challenge Round. If the contestant holding the Hot Spot uncovered a wipeout, the token was taken away and another answer was designated as the Hot Spot.

===Challenge Round===
The two remaining contestants advanced to the Challenge Round, playing for a bonus prize and to become the day&#x27;s champion.

For each category in the Challenge around, the contestants were shown a board with 12 answers, eight correct and four Wipeouts, and they bid back and forth as to how many correct answers they thought they could name. Bidding ended when one contestant either reached the maximum of eight or challenged the other. If the high bidder successfully completed the bid, he/she won the board. One mistake allowed the opponent a chance to steal the board by giving one of the remaining correct answers still on the board. If the opponent could not do so, the high bidder was given another chance to fulfill his/her bid.

The Challenge Round was played as a best two-of-three. The high scorer from the first round started the bidding on the first board, while his/her opponent led off for the second. If a third board was needed, a coin toss decided who would start the bidding. The first contestant to win two boards became champion.

===Bonus round===
The bonus round used a grid of 12 monitors arranged in three rows of four. The champion attempted to win a new car by identifying six correct answers in a category within sixty seconds. After the champion was shown the category and twelve possible answers, he/she selected six. The champion touched the border on the outside of the corresponding monitor and the screen illuminated. Once six monitors were lit, the champion ran and hit a buzzer to lock in the answers. If there were less than six correct, Tomarken told the champion how many he/she had correctly chosen and the champion made changes. The process repeated until all six correct answers were found or time ran out. If the champion managed to find all six answers within the time limit, he/she won the car and retired undefeated. Otherwise, the champion returned until beaten.

<text>Trakošćan Castle (pronounced , or &quot;Dvorac Trakošćan&quot;) is a castle located in northern Croatia (in Varaždin County) that dates back to the 13th century (although the first written mention of the toponym &quot;Trakošćan&quot; is dated to 1334). 

Trakošćan Castle is considered the best preserved and one of the most beautiful castles in Croatia.

==History==
Trakošćan was built in the 13th century within Croatia&#x27;s northwestern fortification system, as a rather small observation fortress for monitoring the road from Ptuj to Bednja Valley.

According to a legend, Trakošćan was named after another fortification (arx Thacorum) that was alleged to have stood in the same spot back in antiquity. Another source claims that it was named after the knights of Drachenstein who were in control of the region in early Middle Ages.

The toponym was first mentioned in written records in 1334. It is not known who its owners were in the first years of its existence. As of the end of the 14th century, it was owned by the Counts of Celje, who were in charge of all of Zagorje County. The family soon became extinct, and Trakošćan shared the fate of their other burgs and estates that were divided and kept changing owners. In these divisions, Trakošćan was, as a whole, first owned by an army leader by the name of Jan Vitovac, then by Ivaniš Korvin, who gave it to his deputy warden Ivan Gyulay. The family kept the castle throughout three generations, and became extinct in 1566, after which the ownership was taken over by the state.

King Maximilian gave the estate to Juraj Drašković (1525–1587) for services rendered, first personally, and then as family heritage. This was how, in 1584, the Drašković family finally came into possession of Trakošćan.

In the second half of the 18th century, when the building of manors was flourishing in Hrvatsko Zagorje, Trakošćan was abandoned. Neglected, it fell quickly into dilapidation. It was only towards the middle of the 19th century that the family became interested once again in its estate, in the Romanticist spirit of return to nature and family traditions. In this spirit, the deputy marshal Juraj V. Drašković turned the castle into a residential manor-house, while the surrounding park was turned into Romanticist pleasure grounds. The generations that followed were staying at the castle from time to time all the way until 1944 when they were forced to emigrate to Austria. Soon after that, the castle became nationalized.

The Museum with collections on permanent display was established in 1953. The castle is today owned by the Republic of Croatia.

The castle itself reveals different phases of building. For several centuries, it used to be a fortification, so that the reconstructions undertaken during that period were functional rather than aesthetic. The facility&#x27;s essential core is a Romanesque fortification consisting of a housing unit, a small fortified yard, and a massive high tower. The fortification&#x27;s good location and its observation tower made it safe and easy to defend. 

Rapid development of firearms and increasingly threatening Turkish attacks made additional construction and further fortifying urgently necessary. The Drašković family&#x27;s second generation, Ivan II and Petar, added the western tower, which may be seen from the coat-of-arms and the accompanying inscription.
On the Great Genealogical Tree, the oldest visual presentation from 1668, the facility had three floors, and its basic dimensions could already be discerned. Over the next period, several defense facilities were added around it. At the time, it also had the highest number of inhabitants, as may be seen from the Small Genealogical Tree dating back to 1755. It was in this same century that the outbuildings were erected at the foothills of Trakošćan, and a stone bridge built over the river Bednja.

In the 19th century Trakošćan acquired its present appearance. In the 1840–62 period, during one among the first restoration undertakings in the country, the castle was reconstructed in Neo-Gothic style. This not only altered its exterior, but also finally brought to an end its five centuries long fortification purpose. The reconstruction also included the appearance of Romanticist pleasure grounds by Juraj V. Drašković, after the model of English parks. When the dam was built, the valley turned into a large lake. The uniqueness of style characterizing the facility equally includes the interior and its surrounding landscape. Count Drašković sold Klenovnik Castle, the largest castle in Croatia, then also held by the Draskovich Family in order to fund the restorations.

After the reconstruction, the castle was still inhabited by several generations of the Drašković family that did some additional constructions and adaptations. It was at the time that the northern tower appeared over the entrance, a large shingle cap added to the top of the tower (removed in 1961), and a southwestern vaulted terrace added. Environment of the Trakošćan was made in accordance with the plan of Franz Risig (1814-1896) and also can be considered an important factor of cultural heritage.

The end of World War II found Trakošćan in a neglected and dilapidated condition, which is why protective architectural and interior decoration works were immediately undertaken. Over the past few years , the castle has once again been undergoing more thorough reconstruction.

<doc id="663240" wikidata="Q1782557" url="?curid=663240" title="Release (Pet Shop Boys album)">
<text>Release is the eighth studio album by English synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys, released on 1 April 2002 by Parlophone/EMI. It was recorded between 2000 and 2001, near fully written and produced by the duo, with the exception of the song &quot;London&quot;, having been co-written and produced by Chris Zippel. The album produced three singles: &quot;Home and Dry&quot;, &quot;I Get Along&quot;, and &quot;London&quot;, the latter of which was only released in continental Europe. It reached number seven on the UK Albums Chart and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics.

==Background==
After the release of their previous studio album, &quot;Nightlife&quot; (1999), Pet Shop Boys originally planned to release a greatest hits collection in the autumn of 2000 with the two new tracks &quot;Positive Role Model&quot; and &quot;Somebody Else&#x27;s Business&quot;. While recording the new songs for the hits collection, it was decided to produce a full-length studio album instead.

The album reached number seven in the United Kingdom and number three in Germany. On its first release, a limited run of metallic effect embossed sleeves were available in a choice of four colours: grey, blue, pink or red. In the US, this limited run also came with a bonus CD including remixes and new tracks. The artwork was designed by Greg Foley of the New York design group and magazine publishers Visionaire and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

The album marked a significant departure from previous work, being guitar- and piano-driven. However, the album was made like their previous albums with most tracks mainly programmed on computers; however, the sampled or synthesised guitars and drum sounds chosen often sound &quot;real&quot; and the synthesisers always present are sometimes used to sound like guitars (the solo in &quot;Birthday Boy&quot;, for instance, or the opening figure of &quot;Home and Dry&quot;). Ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr was brought in later on in the sessions to play real electric and acoustic guitars on seven of the album&#x27;s ten tracks in London, with &quot;Home and Dry&quot; being completed in Dublin, Ireland. Apart from the track &quot;London&quot;, recorded in Berlin with producer Chris Zippel, Pet Shop Boys produced the album themselves and then commissioned Michael Brauer to mix it.

The original version of the album had eleven tracks but &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Get Where I Am Today&quot; was removed from the album before release and later became a bonus track on the 2004 single &quot;Flamboyant&quot;. Other tracks recorded during the sessions for the album which ended up as B-sides are &quot;Between Two Islands&quot;, &quot;Searching for the Face of Jesus&quot;, &quot;Sexy Northerner&quot; and &quot;Always&quot;. Another track, &quot;Time on My Hands&quot;, appeared on the 2003 release, &quot;Disco 3&quot;.

The directors for all three music videos for the album&#x27;s singles are photographers by trade: Wolfgang Tillmans directed &quot;Home and Dry&quot;, Bruce Weber directed &quot;I Get Along&quot; (following his previous work on the &quot;Being Boring&quot; and &quot;Se a vida é&quot; videos), and Martin Parr directed &quot;London&quot;. The Tillmans video, consisting almost entirely of footage of mice filmed at Tottenham Court Road tube station in the London Underground, is considered by some to have significantly undermined the commercial potential of the lead single, due to being deemed nearly unplayable by MTV and other music video channels.

Perhaps partly because of the modest commercial success of this album, and perhaps partly because of the habit of distancing themselves musically from their most recent work, Tennant and Lowe have since returned to their dance roots. One year after the release of &quot;Release&quot;, Pet Shop Boys released &quot;Disco 3&quot; which included remixes of some of the songs from &quot;Release&quot; along with new material that they were working on at the time of writing and producing material for &quot;Release&quot;.

The album re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 30 in August 2017 following the &quot;Release/Further Listening 2001–2004&quot; reissue.

<doc id="663263" wikidata="Q4953688" url="?curid=663263" title="Bracket (tournament)">
<text>A bracket or tournament bracket is a tree-like diagram that represents the series of games played during a knockout tournament. Different knockout tournament formats have different brackets; the simplest and most common is that of the single-elimination tournament. The name &quot;bracket&quot; is American English, derived from the resemblance of the links in the tree diagram to the bracket punctuation symbol ] or [ (called a &quot;square bracket&quot; in British English). The closest British term is draw, although this implies an element of chance, whereas some brackets are determined entirely by seeding.

In some tournaments, the full bracket is determined before the first match. In such cases, fans may enjoy trying to predict the winners of the initial round and of the consequent later matchups. This is called &quot;bracketology&quot;, particularly in relation to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. This prediction is not possible in tournaments such as the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League knockout phase, in which the pairings for a later round might not be made until after the previous round has been played (UEFA Champions League makes its ultimate bracket draw at the Round of 16 stage).

==Usage in North America==

Brackets are commonly found in major North American professional sports leagues and in U.S. college sports. Often, at the end of the regular season, the league holds a post-season tournament (most commonly called a playoff) to determine which team is the best out of all of the teams in the league. This is done because often in American professional sports there are at least two different conferences, and teams mostly play other teams in their own conference. Examples of this are the American Football Conference and the National Football Conference in the NFL, the American League and the National League in Major League Baseball, and the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference in the NBA or NHL.

When there are only two different conferences, there are two sides of the bracket. One conference is on one side, while the other is on the opposite side. Each side is organized according to a team&#x27;s seeding; higher-seeded teams are matched against lower-seeded teams. Teams that qualify for the post-season tournament only compete against teams in their own conference, until only one team from each conference remains. These two teams, called the conference champions, play each other to determine the best in the league. Other leagues, like the NHL, have two conferences, each of which is divided into divisions, usually by region. In the post-season tournament, only the teams with the best records qualify, except the division winner (and also #2 and #3 in the division in the NHL) having an automatic entry into the tournament.

Some North American professional post-season tournaments are single-elimination format. If a bye is required, the top seeded teams usually get the bye. There is usually no third place match to separate the third and fourth place teams.

The concept is even more visible in college sports, most notably in reference to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, in which millions of casual and serious fans &quot;fill out brackets&quot;—predict the winners of each game in the tournament—in both formal contests, sponsored by various corporations, and informal betting pools among friends or colleagues. The brackets are much larger than those in North American professional leagues—while no more than 16 teams qualify for the postseason in any major North American league (this is the case in the NBA and NHL), 68 teams (out of over 350) advance to the NCAA men&#x27;s tournament, with most bracket contests involving 64 of these teams.

==Examples==
The diagrams for formats other than single-elimination are more complex than a simple tree.
==Types of brackets==
;Single Elimination: Teams play &quot;Pool Play&quot; games in order to be &quot;seeded&quot; for the Brackets. Once in the brackets, teams play. Winners advance within the brackets to the right, whereas losers are eliminated in &quot;Single Elimination&quot;

;Double Elimination: Teams play &quot;Pool Play&quot; games to gain their &quot;seeding&quot; going into the brackets. Each team plays its first games. Winners advance to play the winners. Losers play a consolation round.

==Versions of advancement==
;March Madness Seeding (Best v Worst in a division): Divisions are broken into pools (e.g., North, South, East, West) and within each pool teams are ranked. The top seed plays the worst seed, the second best seed plays the 2nd worst seed within the pool, etc., until all teams play their first round. If the pool has an odd (not divisible by 2) number of teams, there will be a &quot;play in&quot; game of the worst vs the 2nd worst team. Such a seeding system produces a wide variety of matches, but requires many games to determine an outcome.

;Jacobian Ladders (Best in pools play, 2nd best in pools play each other, 3rd best in pools play each other, etc.): Within each pool, the number 1 team plays all the other number 1 teams within the other pools. Number 2s play number 2s, numbers 3s play number 3s, etc. 
:* Assuming an even number of pools (e.g., pool A, B, C, and D), each of the #1 ranked team based upon their pool play results play an initial game (A1 vs B1, C1 vs D1). Winners go to the championship. Losers play for 3rd and 4th place.
:*Assuming an odd pools number of pools (e.g., pool A, B, and C), Seed 1 from Pool A (A1) plays seed 1 from Pool B (B1). C1 plays the &quot;Wildcard&quot; from the second best finishers from within all 3 pools based upon the ranking criteria. 
:* All #2, #3, etc., ranked teams play in &quot;Consolation rounds&quot; to determine their ranked order 
:Winners of these pools play at most two games to determine the champion of the division. The end result can be sensitive to ranking criteria and allocation of teams to pools.

<doc id="663275" wikidata="Q912640" url="?curid=663275" title="Black Cat (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Black Cat (Felicia Sara Hardy) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by Marv Wolfman and Dave Cockrum, the character first appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #194 (July 1979). Felicia Hardy is the daughter of Walter Hardy, a world-renowned cat burglar. She trained herself in various fighting styles and acrobatics and, after deciding to follow in her father&#x27;s footsteps, adopted the costumed identity of Black Cat. She has the subconscious ability to affect probability fields, producing &quot;bad luck&quot; for her enemies. Throughout her history, Black Cat has sometimes been an enemy, love interest, and an ally of the superhero Spider-Man.

The character was depicted as a supervillain and adversary of Spider-Man, but over time the two fell in love, which motivated her into becoming both an antiheroine, and his partner. However, their relationship grew complicated after it became apparent that Black Cat was only attracted to the alter ego of Spider-Man and had little to no interest in the hero&#x27;s civilian life as Peter Parker. After their break-up, Black Cat maintained her role as one of Spider-Man&#x27;s most trusted allies and for years the pair shared an on-again, off-again romance.

Since her original introduction in comics, the character has been featured in various other Marvel-licensed products, including video games, animated television series, and merchandise.

==Publication history==
In 1979, creator Marv Wolfman was looking for a female foil for Spider-Woman. He decided to base a character on a Tex Avery cartoon, &quot;Bad Luck Blackie&quot;, in which a black cat brought misfortune to anyone in close proximity. The Black Cat&#x27;s costume and appearance were designed by Dave Cockrum.

When Wolfman changed writing assignments within Marvel Comics to &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, he brought his character with him. He and Cockrum made considerable changes to the character and her appearance over this time; the Black Cat intended to debut in &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; had only her name and powers in common with the one who finally appeared in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. On the bottom of the letters page of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #194 (July 1979), a thumbnail of the intended cover for &quot;Spider-Woman&quot; #9 (December 1978) appears along with a rejected cover for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #194. Wolfman said in an interview:I didn&#x27;t plan Black Cat to be in Spidey. I created her for Spider-Woman (look at the letter column of the first B.C. story and you&#x27;ll see). I then decided to leave Spider-Woman and moved her over. So, I never even thought of Catwoman when I did her. I got the idea for her from a Tex Avery cartoon, Bad Luck Blackie&quot;. Black Cat&#x27;s first comic book appearance was drawn by &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot;&#x27;s (at that time) regular penciller Keith Pollard.

For her first couple decades the Black Cat was primarily a supporting character, but she starred in the 8-page story &quot;The Crown Jewel Caper&quot; in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #57 (August 1990), written by Dwight Jon Zimmerman and pencilled by Mike Harris. According to Zimmerman, the story did not appear in the issue it was originally scheduled for, and when he asked why it had not been published yet, &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;&#x27;s editor Terry Kavanaugh told him that the inker had murdered his wife, in the process spilling blood on the pages he was inking, and consequently the artwork for the story was being held as state&#x27;s evidence for the murder trial. As was his habit, Zimmerman had saved full-size photocopies of the pencilled pages, so the story was re-inked by Josef Rubenstein and published.

Writer/director Kevin Smith began writing the &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; miniseries in 2002. After the third issue the series went on a hiatus until 2005, when Smith revealed he had finally finished writing the scripts. Smith has stated, &quot;While I have zero defense for my lateness (particularly when folks like [Brian Michael] Bendis turn out great stories in multiple books on a monthly basis), I will say this: it&#x27;s a much better story now than it would&#x27;ve been had I completed it back in &#x27;02.&quot;

In the mid-2000s, she starred alongside Wolverine in a limited comic book miniseries titled &quot;Claws&quot;. A sequel to this miniseries, entitled &quot;Claws II&quot;, began publication in July 2011. Black Cat was a lead character in the 2006–2007 &quot;Heroes for Hire&quot; series.

The &quot;Black Cat&quot; ongoing series written by Jed Mackay debuted in June 2019.

==Fictional character biography==

Felicia Hardy was born in Queens, New York. Her father Walter pretended to be a traveling salesman but was a world-renowned cat burglar who, before his arrest, encouraged her to never settle for second best. If she loved basketball, she should work to become a basketball player and not just a cheerleader.

She first dons the Black Cat costume to break her father out of prison. On the same night, she meets Spider-Man. Her father dies, and she then fakes her own death. Despite her antipathy towards men, Felicia feels a kinship with this lone hero; Spider-Man is the first man she felt she could trust and she grows to believe herself in love with him. Felicia looks for a way to earn his trust and continues with the Black Cat persona as a misguided attempt to attract his affection. Seeing the good in Felicia, Spider-Man makes every attempt to have her criminal record expunged.

Felicia is placed in a mental institution but escapes. She joins forces with Spider-Man against the Maggia. She is granted conditional amnesty, and again convinces Spider-Man that she has died.

The Black Cat finally finds the opportunity to prove herself after learning the Kingpin controls an incredibly powerful detonator. The Owl plans to use the weapon to hold New York City hostage. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus plans to use the weapon to destroy the city altogether. However, the Black Cat uses her abilities to steal the item first and protect it from all parties. She gives the detonator to Spider-Man and becomes the target of Doctor Octopus&#x27; revenge. Although Spider-Man tears off his mechanical appendages, Octopus is still able to mentally control them and hold the Black Cat still while his men open fire. Spider-Man barely gets her to the hospital in time and as they operate on the dozens of bullet and knife wounds, Peter realizes just how much he cares for Felicia.

After she recovers, they begin a relationship and soon Peter reveals his identity to her. Felicia has difficulty accepting the fact that Peter is just a man beneath the mask and cannot understand his need for a civilian life. Peter is hurt, but continues the relationship since it was the first time he did not need to hide his life as Spider-Man from someone.

Initially, the &quot;accidents&quot; which seem to befall those who crossed the Black Cat&#x27;s path are merely well-planned stunts and traps. After her near-death experience, Felicia fears her lack of superpowers make her a liability to Spider-Man. She is terrified that his overwhelming need to protect her will eventually get him killed, so Felicia seeks a way to make herself Spider-Man&#x27;s equal. Felicia is offered an opportunity to undergo the same process that was used to create the Scorpion and the Human Fly. The Kingpin uses it on the Black Cat as payback for a theft she committed. Scared and ashamed of being empowered by the Kingpin of crime, she keeps her new abilities a secret from Peter. Her &#x27;bad luck&#x27; power turns out to be infectious, and begins to jinx Spider-Man, which was exactly the Kingpin&#x27;s intent. Feeling a wall of secrets growing between them, Spider-Man breaks up with Felicia. Felicia then begins a &quot;Robin Hood crusade&quot;, stealing from the rich to give to the poor.

Peter soon realizes something is amiss with his own luck and enlists the aid of Doctor Strange to remove the &quot;hex&quot; on him. By doing so, he alters the hex&#x27;s source and changes the Black Cat&#x27;s powers in the process. She finds she has heightened strength, agility, balance, vision, and retractable claws. While burglarizing the mercenary known as the Foreigner, Black Cat is attacked by Sabretooth, the Foreigner&#x27;s hitman; Spider-Man saves her life.

The Black Cat updates her look and her attitude and rekindles her relationship with Spider-Man. She makes peace with his need for a normal life as Peter Parker and stands by him while he is accused of murder as Spider-Man. Together, they track down the source of the elaborate scheme to frame him and fight the Foreigner. Her apartment is fire-bombed by the Foreigner&#x27;s hitman Blaze, and she begins living with Peter Parker. Peter later discovers their relationship is just a ruse against him, and that she had secretly been in a relationship with The Foreigner. However, despite her anger during her ruse, Felicia begins to fall back onto her desire to love Peter. Spider-Man comes home to discover Black Cat discussing her plans to ruin his life by framing him for murder, during a telephone-conversation with The Foreigner. Before he can catch her, she escapes. Spider-Man tracks her down to the Foreigner&#x27;s apartment by attempting to trick Lt. Keating into revealing evidence as Peter Parker. Peter then intercepts a phone-call on Keating&#x27;s phone, which turns out to be Felicia, telling Keating to meet her. However this is a part of her plan, as she intentionally lured Spider-Man into finding her at the Foreigner&#x27;s apartment, causing a fight to ensue between The Foreigner and Spider-Man. Later she clears Spider-Man of his murder charge. In the end, the Black Cat double-crosses the Foreigner and Spider-Man, detailing her plan and her feelings towards Peter in a letter, also explaining that she has fled to Paris to start a new life. This pushes Peter to find support and a new relationship with Mary Jane Watson.

Years later, the Black Cat returns to America, and goes &quot;shopping&quot; (actually shoplifting) with Dagger. She returns to her original costume, seeks out Peter Parker, and in a chance confrontation with Venom learns that Peter had married Mary Jane Watson. Angry and jealous, Felicia begins harassing the couple, taunting Peter by dating his friend Flash Thompson. She physically threatens Mary Jane, confronting her and swearing to ruin their marriage. After Spider-Man uses a device to remove his superhuman abilities, the Black Cat aids him in finding the device again to restore them. In the process, the Black Cat&#x27;s cat-like abilities are completely erased. She realizes that she sincerely cares for Thompson, but when she proposes marriage he refuses her, saying that he was only interested in her because she was the ex-girlfriend of his idol, Spider-Man, but is implied that Flash actually cared for her. The Black Cat later makes up with both Spider-Man and Mary Jane, becoming close friends with them. She subsequently purchases equipment from the Tinkerer to incorporate into her costume to compensate for her lost abilities, and occasionally teams up with Spider-Man.

After Spider-Man unmasks himself, Black Cat is enraged because she felt that they shared a bond over knowing his identity. Though she is dating Thomas Fireheart (a.k.a. Puma), her new romantic interest notes that Felicia may still have some romantic inclinations toward Peter.

The Black Cat joins the new Heroes for Hire during the &quot;Civil War&quot;, though Misty Knight believes that she is just there for the money.

===Marvel Divas===
Black Cat returns in the limited series &quot;Marvel Divas&quot; (a parody of &quot;Sex and the City&quot;). She is one of the main characters, alongside Firestar, Hellcat, and Photon. The writers are Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Tonci Zonjic. Summoned by her friends to cope with Firestar&#x27;s breast cancer, Felicia is financially broken: unable to restart her investigation firm, she is too proud to accept Puma&#x27;s monetary assistance, and her attempts to get a loan are met with open hostility from the banks of New York, often targets of her villainous activities as the Black Cat. Thus, feeling rejected and angry, Felicia begins to consider returning to villainy.

Following &quot;Marvel Divas&quot;, Black Cat returns as a recurring character in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, following a storyline in #606–607 entitled &quot;Back in Black Cat&quot;. Although she remembers her previous encounters with Spider-Man, the events of &quot;One More Day&quot; have erased her memory of his identity. Also, she has regained her &quot;bad luck&quot; powers.

Spider-Man ran into the Black Cat as she was breaking into the penthouse apartment of Dexter Bennett. Spider-Man caught up to her, reminding her that she was the one that dumped him. She and Puma had ended their relationship, so she and Spider-Man rekindle their relationship. Peter later enlists the Black Cat&#x27;s help in getting back his vial of blood from Mister Negative.

Following this, Black Cat received her own four issue mini-series, which was written by Jen Van Meter, illustrated by Javier Pulido and covered by Amanda Conner. In the series, Felicia became caught up in the events of &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; and &quot;Grim Hunt&quot; storyline after her mother Lydia was kidnapped by the members of the Kravinoff family. Felicia agreed to turn herself over to the Kravinoffs in exchange for her mother&#x27;s freedom, but instead sent a decoy while she tracked down her mother and attempted to free her herself. After removing the duct tape from her mother&#x27;s mouth, Felicia discovered that the Kravinoffs had strapped an explosive device to her wrists to kill both of them. Felicia is ultimately able to rescue her mother and keep her safe from the clutches of the Kravinoff family.

Mary Jane enlisted the Black Cat&#x27;s help after Spider-Man was captured by Doc Tramma, who turned out to be the one who restored Felicia&#x27;s bad luck powers. Together they managed to defeat Tramma and save Spider-Man, and agreed to become friends afterwards. Black Cat is next seen in the &quot;Big Time&quot; storyline helping Spider-Man retrieve some experimental vibranium the new Hobgoblin stole for the Kingpin.

===Spider-Island===
Black Cat appears in the &quot;Spider-Island&quot; story arc, fighting against the half-spider creatures, when the Heroes for Hire are called in to help with the quarantine of Manhattan.

Afterwards, Black Cat was blamed for the theft of a Holographic Projector from Horizon Labs. Since Spider-Man was with her at the time of the robbery he knew that she was innocent, and he recruited Matt Murdock (a.k.a. Daredevil) to help prove her innocence. It was later revealed that the criminal organization Black Spectre framed her to test her as part of their plot to recruit the Black Cat to their side and offer her a huge cash reward for retrieving a device that Matt Murdock has in his possession. Afterwards she goes to Matt&#x27;s apartment and they start a relationship which is part of her plan. However she betrays Black Spectre and alerts Daredevil, leaving him a note saying the organization is monitoring his actions, before going into hiding.

===Marvel NOW!===
As part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; event, Felicia was later contacted by her friend, Misty Knight, other to help the Fearless Defenders fight the so-called Doom Maidens along with other heroines such as Storm, Tigra, Hellcat and Valkyrie.

Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus&#x27; mind in Peter Parker&#x27;s body) swings in his patrol heading for another date with his girlfriend Anna Maria Marconi only to bump into the Black Cat, who was committing a robbery. Felicia attempts to flirt, but suddenly Superior Spider-Man attacks her punching her straight into her face, taking out a tooth in the process. Superior Spider-Man continues the assault reminiscing about how he once tried to kill her, but now he was just apprehending her as a criminal. This leaves Felicia totally shocked and angry while swearing revenge after Superior Spider-Man wraps her in webbing. The Black Cat&#x27;s capture is caught live for everyone to see. As a result, her criminal contacts distance themselves from her and her stolen treasures are sent back to their owners. This public humiliation hardens her to the core.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot; comics returning the true Spider-Man, Black Cat later escapes at the beginning of the new &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series when Electro stages a breakout at the prison where she was being held. Determined to regain her standing by defeating Spider-Man, she attacks him while he is trying to evacuate a burning building, forcing Spider-Man to pretend to still be Doctor Octopus to drive her away as he cannot afford to lose time rescuing civilians. Felicia then makes contact with Electro, suggesting that they collaborate in seeking revenge on Spider-Man. Black Cat is in Parker Industries, making a record of all the tech they are currently producing. However she does not understand them, and opts to &#x27;steal&#x27; someone who does. Sajani has had enough of Peter&#x27;s constant disappearances and vows to make Peter see how he deals with everything without her help. Black Cat then pulls her away, commenting on her perfect timing. Black Cat and Electro later raid Eel&#x27;s hideout where she has Electro defeat him. Black Cat and Electro later show up at a meeting between Mister Negative and Phil Urich (who is now leading the remnants of the Goblin Underground as the self-proclaimed Goblin King) where they throw Eel&#x27;s body in between them. Black Cat states to Mister Negative and Phil Urich that she has heard about how they were outed by Spider-Man and wants in on their plan. During Peter&#x27;s interview on the Fact Channel, Electro attacks the security team on the channel and Black Cat arrives announcing her demand that if Spider-Man does not show up in fifteen minutes, Peter will be dead. Electro complains about the plan but Black Cat stays determined that Spider-Man will show up, but then Silk arrives to confront them both, giving Peter the time to change into Spider-Man and jump into action, naming Silk. As she battles against Electro and Spider-Man deals with Black Cat, J. Jonah Jameson remains on the channel forcing the cameraman to film the action. Spider-Man tries to convince Black Cat to stop even while she does not believe his story of being mind-swapped. Black Cat deviates one of Electro&#x27;s bolts, hitting Spider-Man and knocking him down in the process. Black Cat attempts to unmask Spider-Man as Jameson aims the camera, but Jameson&#x27;s angle prevents anyone seeing Spider-Man&#x27;s face long enough for Silk to knock Black Cat back and Spider-Man to put his mask back on. Although Electro accepts being depowered when his uncontrollable abilities prove dangerous even to himself, Black Cat continues her vendetta against Spider-Man regardless of who is behind the mask. Following Electro&#x27;s depowerment, the criminals at the Bar with No Name want Black Cat to lead them.

The final issue of &quot;The Superior Foes of Spider-Man&quot; reveals that Boomerang&#x27;s love interest was in fact Black Cat, who had disguised herself in order manipulate Boomerang and his Sinister Six into helping her acquire a priceless portrait of Doctor Doom without a mask. The character next appears as the villain of &quot;Hawkeye vs. Deadpool&quot;, where she is revealed to have used an associate&#x27;s expertise in mind control to infiltrate New York&#x27;s law enforcement and judicial systems, and create an army of &quot;drones&quot; out of the patients and staff of Brooklyn Psychiatric. When a hacker who had acquired a list of all active S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, who Black Cat intends to brainwash as well, betrays her, Felicia hires Typhoid Mary to help her acquire the USB flash drive containing the list, opposed by Deadpool, Hawkeye, and Kate Bishop. When cornered by the trio and the authorities, Black Cat murders the mind control specialist, and escapes by switching places with her arresting officer, a sleeper agent.

In the Slide-Away Casino, Melter and Killer Shrike take Ringer to the back room where Black Cat is waiting. Black Cat shows him various items and tells him that even she cannot steal everything and sometimes must pay for them and asks him how is she supposed to do that when nobodies like him do not pay her weekly cut. Ringer tells her he did not pay because he was captured by Silk, owed the Spot for getting him out of jail, and had to pay the Tinkerer for new equipment. He also tells Black Cat they worked in some works before and remembers her having a heart and asks for compassion. Black Cat hesitates long enough for the Ringer to attack them, hitting her in her arm before she takes him down. Black Cat tells Ringer that he will make three times the cut and will also serve as an example by having Killer Shrike and Melter beat him up. Black Cat is surprised Ringer could tag her as she normally is more lucky. She wonder if it was luck to remind her of who she is now and tests her luck with one of the casino&#x27;s machines and wins. Black Cat notices that lately the harder she listens to the part of her that tells her not to let anyone put her down, the more her luck gets off the charts. She remembers her life in the elite class before she lost it all. Melter and Killer Shriek bring in Ringer and Black Cat tells him to spread the word that no one steals from her. Two years ago, Felicia Hardy presents a painting in an elite party. In the present day at a museum, Regina Venderkamp, the woman who bought all the items confiscated from the Black Cat in an auction, presents the same painting that Felicia did. However, the lights go out for a moment and the painting is gone. An enraged Regina and her bodyguards go to her apartment only to find all of her treasures gone. She goes upstairs to see if she also took everything there, despite a bodyguard protesting since Black Cat could still be there. Black Cat then appears and says she couldn&#x27;t leave without Regina learning that no one takes from Black Cat without paying. Regina orders her bodyguards to attack, but Black Cat quickly takes them out. She reflects that her bad luck powers seem to work better when she is ruthless and she may have been holding back before. Black Cat throws one of her claws to Regina&#x27;s neck causing her to pass out. Hours later, Regina wakes up handcuffed to a chair at Black Cat&#x27;s hideout. Black Cat contemplates almost all of the items that were confiscated and those she retrieved with only one missing. In J. Jonah Jameson Sr. and Aunt May&#x27;s apartment, they contemplate the last item the only thing they got at the auction and go watch TV unaware that the Black Cat plans to steal it back. Following Spider-Man&#x27;s fight with Ghost at Parker Industries, Black Cat places the statue with the rest of her things while having Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina Venderkamp tied up. Jay asks her why did she took them as she doesn&#x27;t need money and they didn&#x27;t do nothing to her. Felicia pours gasoline around her apartment and tells Jay he is wrong as they bought her things in the auction, a collection she spent years acquiring. She tells him that&#x27;s the problem with possessions, they can break, you can lose them or they can be taken. And when that happens, everyone thinks they can take what&#x27;s yours unless you prove them wrong. She says that nothing and no one will have that hold on him before setting the apartment on fire. When Spider-Man arrives, May warns him that the Black Cat is still in there and Peter asks Felicia for help. She tells him to save them if he wants as she made her point and the more people know the better. Parker tries to convince her that this isn&#x27;t her but she tells him that the Felicia he knew is gone and she is done being who others want. She tells her that she controls her fate and anyone who stands before that will also be gone. Spider-Man manages to save Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., and Regina, who screams at him for not saving her things before May shushes her, telling her that people are what count, not things and Spider-Man knows that. In the Slide-A-Way Casino, Black Cat tells her men that they have seen what happens when they stay on her good side and what happens when they cross her. But from now on, there&#x27;s nothing holding her back and no limit to what she will do.

===All-New All-Different Marvel===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot;, Black Cat took in Silk as the latest member of her gang. Unbeknownst to Black Cat, Silk is secretly doing working undercover for S.H.I.E.L.D.

Black Cat established a criminal empire which is disbanded by Gwenpool and Howard the Duck.

Black Cat formed an alliance with Hammerhead, his nephew, and his henchmen.

During the &quot;Civil War II&quot; storyline, Black Cat took in Kingpin&#x27;s former minion Janus Jardeesh as the latest member of her gang. She was later informed about Janus undergoing Terrigenesis and arrived at the scene. During one of the heists by Black Cat&#x27;s gang, Black Cat encountered the Avengers. She, Fancy Dan, and Janus Jardeesh evaded capture. Afterwards, Black Cat decided to lay low for a while.

Black Cat gained Scorpion as a part-time enforcer for her gang. She hired ex-Army Ranger Lee Price to accompany Scorpion to the black market sale where there was shootout with Tombstone&#x27;s gang. When at Black Cat&#x27;s hideout, Scorpion accuses Lee Price of botching up the black market sale which Lee Price denied leading Black Cat to demand an explanation after hearing about some information from her spies at the New York City Police Department telling her what they know.

During the &quot;Venom Inc.&quot; storyline, after Lee Price steals the spawn of the Venom symbiote from Flash Thompson&#x27;s protege Andi Benton aka Mania and uses it to become Maniac, with his newfound ability to reproduce the symbiote and gain control of people, Price was able to gain control of Black Cat and her gang. With the aid of Flash&#x27;s new powers as Anti-Venom, Black Cat was freed. Later working with Venom, Black Cat was able to use the artificial Anti-Venom element they got from Dr. Steven to free Spider-Man from Price&#x27;s control. During the final battle, Black Cat discovers that those already cured cannot be taken over by Price&#x27;s symbiote again, allowing Spider-Man to use his cured bloodstream and mix it with Anti-Venom to defeat Price. Afterwards she and Spider-Man make peace, and later Eddie Brock convinces Black Cat to give up being a crime boss and go back to being a vigilante.

===Fresh Start===
During Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Start&quot;, Black Cat teamed up with Spider-Man to confront the Thieves Guild, a group of robbers established hundreds of years ago that was trying to make their name known again by stealing the equipment of various super heroes. As an honorary member of the Guild, she was able to allow the two to break in and fight off Guild members until the rest of the heroes showed up to reclaim their items. Later that night, Felicia tells Spider-Man that her darker mentality didn&#x27;t start when Doctor Octopus arrested her, but instead when she forgot Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity as a result of Doctor Strange making everyone forget it after a &quot;Civil War&quot;, feeling that she lost a significant part of her life in the process. In response, Peter takes off his mask and reveals his secret to Felicia, which she gladly accepts. Afterwards, Kindred (Harry Osborn) learns of Spider-Man&#x27;s rekindled friendship with Black Cat and claims that Peter &quot;drags everyone into his own Hell&quot;.

During the &quot;Last Remains&quot; storyline, Black Cat gets her hands on the Hand of the Vishanti and makes a 3D replica of it. This attracts the attention of Doctor Strange who wants it back. Black Cat reluctantly gives it to him in exchange that she helps to save Spider-Man&#x27;s soul. After the Order of the Web helps Doctor Strange in fixing the Brooklyn Bridge, Black Cat is instructed by Doctor Strange to guard the Hand of the Vishanti as he takes Madame Web&#x27;s advice to use in tracking Kindred.

==Powers and abilities==
Initially, the Black Cat had no superhuman abilities. Later, a test induced by the Kingpin gave her the psionic ability to affect probability fields; essentially, she could produce &quot;bad luck&quot; for her enemies. The &quot;bad luck&quot; power entails that under stress she is subconsciously able to cause anyone in her immediate vicinity that she perceives as a threat to be susceptible to freak accidents, like guns jamming and exploding, or tripping on objects. This ability also had the side effect of eventually causing problems for anyone spending long periods of time around her.

Doctor Strange eventually tampered with her powers that briefly removed her bad luck abilities, along with the unwanted side effect. However, this magical tampering temporarily endowed her with cat-like abilities, giving her night vision, retractable talons in her fingertips, superhuman speed, strength, agility and endurance, proportionate to a cat. Her psionic &quot;bad luck&quot; powers and former temporary abilities were eventually restored by Doctor Tramma through the use of cybernetics.

The Black Cat has reflexes, agility, and stamina of an Olympic level acrobat. She is physically very strong and athletic and has great physical endurance. She is an excellent street fighter capable of taking on several armed assailants and incapacitating them without being injured herself. She is trained in several martial arts styles, including Judo and Goju Ryu Karate. Hardy is a talented photographer; while dating Spider-Man she takes pictures of the hero that he admits are better than his own work.

The Black Cat has also acquired several devices from the Tinkerer that increase her agility and heighten her strength. She wears earrings that interact with the balance centers of her brain to grant her enhanced agility. She has contact lenses that let her see in various ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as infrared and ultraviolet. Her costume contains micro-servos that enhance her strength above normal human levels. The gloves of her costume contain steel micro-filaments, which form retractable claws at the fingertips when she flexes her fingers (triggering a magnetic surge which condenses the filaments into polarized talons) which enable her to tear through most surfaces and easily scale walls. Using this equipment, the Black Cat has been able to beat enemies who have superhuman abilities.

The Black Cat has a miniature grappling hook device hidden in the &quot;fur&quot; of each glove, designed by her father Walter Hardy which enables her to swing from buildings in a manner similar to Spider-Man, though not quite as fast. She can also use the cable from this device as a tightrope, wall scaling device, swing line, or as a weapon in combat.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==

===Critical response===

Liam McGuire of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; referred to Black Cat as a &quot;fan-favorite figure in the comics&quot;, writing, &quot;The character has become an A-list character in the comics, as her costume, personality, and playfulness - all displayed in the piece - have captured the attention of readers and turned Black Cat into an antihero they are thrilled to see pop up in stories.&quot; Elliot Swan of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called Black Cat &quot;interesting and complex&quot;, saying, &quot;She has proven herself as a hero worthy of the chance to develop outside the web of Spider-Man and has developed beyond being a footnote in the life of Marvel&#x27;s iconic web-slinger. [...] Jed Mackay has been instrumental in igniting a new era of passionate fanfare for Black Cat, and she is very deserving of the acclaim. Felicia Hardy has not only been loyal to Spider-Man, but she continues to be an exciting three-dimensional heroine who shines outside the shadows of her male counterparts.&quot; Joseph Baxter of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described Black Cat as an &quot;A-list Spider-Man character&quot;, stating, &quot;Felicia initially arrived as a formidable-fighter of a thief in the web-thwipping crosshairs of Spidey, having learned the trade from her legendary thief of a father. However, she eventually proved that she possesses a moral fiber, which resulted in Felicia becoming an ally against evil and on-again-off-again romantic interest for Spidey (in a dynamic that one could argue too closely mirrors DC&#x27;s Batman and Catwoman). Regardless, the character has remained a staple in Spidey&#x27;s comic book universe.&quot; Peyton Hinckle of &quot;ComicsVerse&quot; referred to Black Cat as &quot;the shining example in comics of an independent woman who can find happiness outside of relationships,&quot; asserting, &quot;Thankfully, we somehow, against the odds, have Black Cat, who completely defies those norms. She&#x27;s a bluntly sexual character who is also hilarious. She doesn&#x27;t have to be a man to crack a joke about body parts or to banter with Spider-Man about the Green Goblin&#x27;s latest hair cut. Her willingness to be sexually appealing doesn&#x27;t mean she can&#x27;t snort when she laughs. She can be smart, sexy, funny, and creative and still be the same woman.&quot;

Deirdre Kaye of &quot;Scary Mommy&quot; called Black Cat a &quot;role model&quot; and a &quot;truly heroic&quot; female character. Eric Diaz of &quot;Nerdist&quot; wrote, &quot;Although initially created as a Catwoman-like, sexy cat burglar villain for Spider-Man to fight back in 1979, much like her DC counterpart, Felicia Hardy had a soft spot for the hero she battled the most. Eventually, Felicia got romantically involved with Spidey, and she learned his true identity long before his main squeeze Mary Jane ever did. Over the years, she has had several stories which focused on her and developed her backstory, making her way more than just Marvel&#x27;s Catwoman.&quot; Dana Forsythe of &quot;Syfy&quot; stated, &quot;Beloved as one of the Marvel Universe&#x27;s best burglars and foil to the amazing Spider-Man, Felicia Hardy has walked the fine line of anti-hero and villain since she made her debut in &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #194.&quot; Susana Polo of &quot;Polygon&quot; stated, &quot;Catwoman predates Black Cat by several decades, and they&#x27;re both infamous female cat burglars who wear black, skintight costumes. They both have &quot;cat&quot; in their name. And they both enjoy a will-they-won&#x27;t-they relationship with an urban male superhero — Batman and Spider-Man, respectively — who feels conflicted about dating them because of their illegal activities. But the unlikely truth is that all of those similarities are pure coincidence — or maybe just Felicia Hardy&#x27;s bad luck to be created second [...] Stories of deliberate ripoffs and open inspiration are so common in the comics world that nobody could be faulted for thinking there was some funny business going on in Black Cat&#x27;s creation. But what actually happened is even more interesting. Black Cat and Catwoman are a rare, genuine example of convergent evolution.&quot;

Anthony Orlando of &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; said, &quot;Now that Peter and MJ have officially separated, now is the perfect time for him to meet the Black Cat. Born Felicia Hardy, this cat burglar became Spider-Man&#x27;s partner/girlfriend, and she has repeatedly fought alongside him over the years, making her increasingly popular with fans. Though she may seem like a copycat of Catwoman, Hardy is still a fascinating and complex character all her own, and she could provide much-needed support to Spider-Man in his new, lonely life.&quot; Rachel Leishman of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; called Black Cat &quot;incredibly interesting&quot;, writing, &quot;For a character who is beloved in the world of comics, Felicia Hardy hasn&#x27;t really had her time. By that, I mean her time in the live-action world. With three separate movie franchises built around Peter Parker, you&#x27;d think that we&#x27;d have more of her in our films. Instead, we have Felicity Jones in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and … that&#x27;s pretty much it. (Granted, we were supposed to have her in one of the Raimi films, but alas.) So now, with a plethora of rumors surrounding the Spider-Verse (like the fact that we could be getting a show led by Silk and the Olivia Wilde movie heading our way) and who we&#x27;re going to get in the live-action form, my pitch is for a Black Cat anything Whether it&#x27;s just in the Tom Holland movies or in a franchise all her own, Felicia Hardy deserves her time.&quot; Nahila Bonfiglio of &quot;The Daily Dot&quot; asserted, &quot;One of the things that many viewers love about the current iteration of Spider-Man is his charming innocence, something that doesn&#x27;t mesh well with a character like Black Cat. While every iteration of Peter Parker carries some degree of good-natured naiveté, at his current age, he&#x27;s better equipped to handle adversaries who don&#x27;t utilize their sex appeal. In the future, however, Black Cat would make a welcome addition to the MCU, as a cameo or full movie. Fans of the comics and films alike would love to see Peter Parker mature, and the inclusion of such an engaging, complicated antiheroine would no doubt delight viewers. We don&#x27;t know if it will ever happen, but here&#x27;s hoping the future sees plenty more Black Cat on the big—and small—screen.&quot; Joshua Medina of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; stated, &quot;With Tom Holland&#x27;s Spider-Man having fantastic success in the MCU and possibly getting a second trilogy of movies, fans can only hope to see the stunning and cunning Black Cat in action. She is quite literally Spider-Man&#x27;s Kryptonite in human form; she is such a pure and seductive beauty,&quot; while Chance Arradondo ranked her 9th in their &quot;Anti-Heroes That Deserve Their Own Movie&quot; list.

Anthony Orlando of &quot;Digital Trends&quot; included Black Cat in their &quot;12 new Marvel Characters We Want To See In The Spider-Man 4 Movie&quot; list. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; asserted, &quot;Spider-Man doesn&#x27;t have a lot of iconic female villains (Peter Parker isn&#x27;t the type to punch a girl if he can help it), but he does have Black Cat. Black Cat is similar to Catwoman, both in the sense that she&#x27;s a skilled thief who dresses with a cat motif and because she has a complicated and sometimes romantic relationship with Spidey. That&#x27;s not to say Felicia Hardy is a carbon copy of Selina Kyle. She&#x27;s a complex character who looks out mostly for herself and struggles to move forward from a rough youth,&quot; included Black Cat in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Femme Fatales&quot; list, and ranked her 24th in their &quot;Top 25 Spider-Man Villains&quot; list. &quot;Sideshow&quot; ranked Black Cat 3rd in their &quot;Top 10 Cat-Themed Comic Book Characters&quot; list. Mark Ginocchio of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; ranked Black Cat 7th in their &quot;7 Best Female Characters from the Spider-Man Multiverse&quot; list. &quot;Bust&quot; ranked Black Cat 7th in their &quot;13 Female Marvel Characters Who Kick Ass&quot; list, saying, &quot;With training in aerobics and stunts, she is no stranger to slinking from roof to roof. Black Cat dates Spider-Man, and is basically the coolest bad girl in town.&quot;

&quot;Screen Rant&quot; included Black Cat in their &quot;10 Best Marvel Characters Who Made Their Debut In Spider-Man Comics&quot; list, in their &quot;10 Spider-Man Villains That Should Get A Solo Movie&quot; list, in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Vigilantes In Marvel Comics&quot; list, and in their &quot;10 Best Spider-Man Comics Characters Not In The MCU&quot; list, and ranked her 3rd in their &quot;10 Best Relationships in Spider-Man Comics&quot; list, 10th in their in their &quot;Spider-Man: 10 Best Female Villains&quot; list, 10th in their &quot;10 Most Powerful Silk Villains In Marvel Comics&quot; list, and 10th in their &quot;10 LGBTQ+ Marvel Heroes That Should Join The MCU&quot; list. &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Black Cat 2nd in their &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s 10 Coolest Allies&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;Spider-Man: His 10 Best Sidekicks&quot; list, 3rd in their &quot;10 Best Spider-Man Villains Missing From No Way Home&quot; list, 5th in their &quot;10 Most Attractive Marvel Villains&quot; list, 9th in their &quot;10 Best Cat-Themed Superheroes In Comics&quot; list, 10th in their &quot;10 Spider-Man Villains Fans Grew To Love&quot; list, 10th in their &quot;Marvel&#x27;s 10 Best Heroes Who Use Luck To Their Advantage&quot; list, and 11th in their &quot;25 Best Anti-Heroes In Marvel Comics&quot; list.

===Volumes===

==== &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: Evil That Men Do&quot; (2002) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; #1 was the 2nd best selling comic book in June 2002. &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; #1 was the 14th best selling comic book in 2002.

Shawn S. Lealos of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked the &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot; comic book series 1st in their &quot;10 Must-Read Comics Written By Clerks Creator Kevin Smith&quot; list, writing, &quot;One of the most controversial comic book storylines Kevin Smith ever wrote came with Marvel Comics&#x27; series &quot;Spider-Man/Black Cat: The Evil That Men Do&quot;. The controversy here was part of the Women in Fridges concept, as Smith had someone sexually assault Black Cat as a kickoff for the story. The series attempted to look at how this assault turned Felicia into the woman she became, but the problem is that this was not a series that fans liked reading at the time because it took Smith four years to finish it. The first issue hit in 2002, and he didn&#x27;t release the sixth and final issue until 2006. Now, fans can pick up the entire series and read it all the way through for one of Smith&#x27;s more thoughtful comic book stories.&quot; Spider-Man and Black Cat find themselves begrudgingly working together again when their cases overlap. But things take a dark turn when Felicia is arrested for the murder of rapist, Garrison Klum: A crime she didn&#x27;t commit. Facing the death penalty, Peter hires Matt Murdock to act as her lawyer, with the pair dedicated to saving their feline friend. It&#x27;s not a series for the faint-hearted, as Smith tackles some difficult and disturbing subject matter, revealing the tragic past of not one but two infamous Spider-rogues.&quot;

====&quot;Claws&quot; (2006)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Claws&quot; #1 was the 60th best selling comic book in August 2006. &quot;Claws&quot; #2 was the 69th best selling comic book in September 2006. &quot;Claws&quot; #3 was the 71st best selling comic book in October 2006.

Craig Lines of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; stated, &quot;The tone of Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray&#x27;s script, although quite violent, is very much classic romantic adventure, with Wolverine and Black Cat trading flirtatious banter and saucy body language as they splat bad dudes. It&#x27;s the sort of naughty comedy-action romp that Kevin Smith started and should&#x27;ve finished with his failed &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; mini-series (as opposed to the jumbled, misogynistic angst-fest it became). Whilst not exactly challenging, there are some good laughs and even a touch of suspense. In addition to zippy writing, the artwork is also consistently nice. I liked Joe Linsner&#x27;s interpretation of the Black Cat costume and, having seen her drawn so atrociously in recent years (come on down, Clayton Crain), &quot;Claws&quot; scores points on that front alone. On the down side, the mini-series is maybe an issue too short and I personally felt it lost its pace a little in Issue Three with an extended (and utterly unnecessary) flashback sequence, but otherwise, &quot;Claws&quot; is a sharp little critter and well worth getting your paws on.&quot; Kirsten Murray of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked the &quot;Claws&quot; comic book series 5th in their &quot;10 Greatest Black Cat Stories Ever&quot; list, saying, &quot;An unlikely duo teamed up in three-part miniseries, &quot;Claws&quot;. Wolverine and the Black Cat find themselves held captive in cages on a mysterious island, confronted by a group of hunters led by someone claiming to be Kraven the Hunter. If the pair make it to a boat waiting to take them to their rescue on the other side of the island, they can go free. However, they have to evade the huntsmen. An action-packed adventure ensues, with Wolverine and Black Cat working together effectively as they dodge bullets, rockets, and even killer robots. Their sharp back-and-forth and willingness to get their hands dirty made this series so popular, it spawned a sequel.&quot;

====&quot;Claws II&quot; (2011)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Claws&quot; #1 was the 130th best selling comic book in July 2011.

Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; gave &quot;Wolverine &amp; Black Cat: Claws&quot; #1 a grade of 6.5 out of 10, asserting, &quot;Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray offer up another rollicking adventure that&#x27;s heavy on action and laughs and light on anything resembling substance. There&#x27;s really no deep connection to exploit between the title heroes, so this story plays out like another take on the Wolverine/Domino dynamic from X-Force: Sex + Violence. It would have been nice to see the writers throw a new batch of villains into the mix rather than Arcade and White Rabbit. The humor also borders on being too silly and simplistic at times, such as the scene where a villain crashes into a hot dog cart and elicits a stereotypical New Yorker reaction from those around him. Again, the story is good, dumb fun, but too heavy on the dumb at times. In any case, the main appeal with either volume of &quot;Claws&quot; lies in seeing Joseph Linsner try his hand at Marvel&#x27;s stable. For the most part, that&#x27;s enough to sell the book. Linsner&#x27;s work is sexy, playful, and dynamic - an all-around perfect fit for the script. Sure, his Wolverine is some bizarre amalgamation of hairless ape and furry were-beast, but at least he&#x27;s back to being short and ugly. Lighthearted romps are all good and well. Where &quot;Claws&quot; &quot;II&quot; will find its greatest challenge is in competing with books like &quot;Astonishing Spider-Man &amp; Wolverine&quot;. That series has proven a comic can offer simple, unfettered fun and still rank as one of the best of the year. &quot;Claws&quot; can&#x27;t get by with coasting on the bare minimum.&quot;

====&quot;Black Cat&quot; (2019)====
=====Issue 1=====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 was the best selling comic book in June 2019, with over 250 000 sold units. &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 was the 4th best selling comic book of 2019.

Sam Stone of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; compared &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 to &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, writing, &quot;Fun, true to the character, and action-packed, the inaugural issue of &quot;Black Cat&quot; is a top-down joy to read both for longtime fans of the character while being completely accessible to new readers. The creative team seamlessly mixes genres and explores the possibilities of the character without shying away from Felicia Hardy&#x27;s recent villainous history. Reestablishing the character as a cool, confident burglar with her own checkered past, &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 sets the stage for a heist-oriented adventure in the heart of the Marvel Universe for its eponymous protagonist.&quot; Charlie Ridgely of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 a &quot;surprisingly enjoyable read&quot;, saying, &quot;&quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 is a simple and grounded, but exciting series that gives an underutilized character the chance to shine on her own. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it gets better as it goes along and is certainly well-worth your time, if you&#x27;re looking for a new series to try out.&quot;

=====Issue 2=====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Cat&quot; #2 was the 8th best selling comic book in July 2019. &quot;Black Cat&quot; #2 was the 89th best selling comic book in 2019.

Charlie Ridgely of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Black Cat&quot; #2 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, &quot;Color me surprised once again, but Black Cat is a good book. It&#x27;s a caper-heist comic that continues to be better than you&#x27;d think it has any right to be, turning a supporting character like Felicia Hardy into an effortlessly compelling leading force. It&#x27;s almost impossible not to be captured by her, as well as the characters around her. Everything at work in this book was already great, but adding in a crazed Merlin and a trip to the Sanctum Santorum make it even better. It&#x27;s time to add this one to your pull list.&quot;

==== &quot;Black Cat&quot; (2020) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 was the 29th best selling comic book in December 2020.

Sam Stone of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; described &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 as a &quot;solid relaunch&quot;, stating, &quot;MacKay and Villa reunite to take springboard Black Cat&#x27;s latest comic off the back of &quot;King in Black&quot;, staying true to the spirit of the character and their previous series while managing to complement the bombastic crossover event. MacKay and Villa succeed in making this opening issue feel more like a tie-in to the crossover&#x27;s story than several of the previous issues bearing the &quot;King in Black&quot; tie-in banner. Despite the new #1, Black Cat&#x27;s relaunch keeps very much in line with what came before it while inviting new readers to jump on for a thrill ride as Felicia rises as the Marvel Universe&#x27;s unlikely greatest savior.&quot; Tanner Dedmon of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; called &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1 an &quot;excellent jumping-on point&quot;, asserting, &quot;Black Cat also has a surprisingly reserved presence in her own debut issue, but that&#x27;s again owed to everything occurring around her. Seeing Black Cat slay symbiote dragons might have been memorable, but considering how other heroes have performed against similar threats, it never would&#x27;ve been believable. As such, Black Cat sometimes gets overshadowed during the more explosive moments of &quot;Black Cat&quot; #1. That type of action was never her game anyway—&quot;above my pay grade&quot;, she says at one point in the issue—so her sacrifice of the spotlight was a necessary one to set her up for an opportunity to do what she does best. Like Captain America&#x27;s confidence imbued in her, Black Cat&#x27;s resolve is infectious, easily carrying whatever comes next in her new series.&quot;

====&quot;Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; (2021)====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; #1 was 24th best selling comic book in December 2021.

Dustin Holland of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called &quot;Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; #1 the &quot;perfect ending for Black Cat and the Infinite Destinies Crossover,&quot; asserting, &quot;&quot;Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; #1 gives Felicia the heroic ending she deserves. The issue delivers a fun, action-packed story that addresses numerous characters and storylines without rushing anything. MacKay and Villa give Black Cat the opportunity to finish one of the most important jobs of her storied career. Felicia definitely still has some unfinished business, but this ending encapsulates the spirit of the &quot;Black Cat&quot; series perfectly.&quot; Adam Barnhardt of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Giant-Size Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; #1 a grade of 4.5 out of 5, saying, &quot;Jed MacKay&#x27;s time with Black Cat has already been exceptional enough—then you factor in a stellar one-shot like Infinity Score, and it takes everything to a whole other level. Here, you have Felicia Hardy using half of the Infinity Stones for a relatively small purpose in the cosmic scheme of things—but it&#x27;s an extremely personal and heartfelt reason as to why she does. And that&#x27;s where MacKay often succeeds most: making these bombastic heroes as human as they can be. Hardy sets out to do her biggest score, regardless of the costs and she aces it, in more ways than one. As far as finales go, it&#x27;s hard to imagine Infinity Score being a better endcap. For a street-level character that oftentimes aligns herself with the slimiest characters in the entire Marvel stable, &quot;Black Cat: Infinity Score&quot; #1 is packed to the brim with heart and a certain warmth that&#x27;s perfect for the holiday season.&quot;

==== &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; (2022) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 was the 21st best selling comic book in January 2022.

Sayantan Gayen of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; referred to &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 as a &quot;thrilling tale peppered with drama and intrigue,&quot; writing, &quot;It is not an exaggeration to say that &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 features one of the best Marvel crossovers in recent history. Jed MacKay writes an equally beautiful team-up of Black Cat and Ben Reilly in the &quot;Death of Doctor Strange: Spider-Man&quot; #1. Needless to say, MacKay has a good grasp on the character of Felicia Hardy and has found a seamless way to connect her with other characters across the Spider-Man mythos. Mary Jane and Black Cat may look at each other as romantic rivals, but the instant bonding between the two and the comfort they feel in each other&#x27;s company is heartwarmingly beautiful to see. &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 is an enthralling and charming tale.&quot; Hannibal Tabu of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; gave &quot;Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond&quot; #1 a grade of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;Jed MacKay has done some great work in building the legend of the Black Cat over the last few years, and this issue carries through the fruits of those labors in a Felicia Hardy that&#x27;s quick to improvise but just as considerate and calculating.&quot;

==== &quot;Iron Cat&quot; (2022) ====
According to Diamond Comic Distributors, &quot;Iron Cat&quot; #1 was the 11th top advance-reordered comic book between May 23, 2022, and 29, 2022.

I-J Wheaton of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; called &quot;Iron Cat&quot; #1 a &quot;neon-tinted team-up comic&quot;, saying, &quot;&quot;Iron Cat&quot; #1 draws together many elements of the mythos that have been steadily building around Black Cat. It is very exciting to see a relative newcomer like Black Cat being pushed further into the mainstream with a team-up with a prominent Marvel character like Iron Man. With any luck, we&#x27;ll see a whole new generation of readers checking out Black Cat and her previous solo comics. That being said, &quot;Iron Cat&quot; #1 is as much about the future as it is the past, and this first issue sets the stage for a thrilling adventure.&quot; Logan Moore of &quot;ComicBook.com&quot; gave &quot;Iron Cat&quot; #1 a grade of 4 out of 5, asserting, &quot;Iron Cat gets off to a very fun start here in issue #1. In short, this series sees Black Cat and Iron Man coming together to go after a common enemy known as Iron Cat. This opening issue does a great job of quickly introducing all the major players in this story while also catching readers up on important aspects of previous Black Cat storylines. I&#x27;m curious to see what kind of legs Iron Cat has, but for now, I&#x27;m very excited to see how this series develops.&quot;

==In other media==
===Television===

* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appears in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1981) episode &quot;Curiosity Killed the Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Morgan Lofting.
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994), voiced by Jennifer Hale. This version was Peter Parker&#x27;s first love interest before he met Mary Jane Watson, leading to Felicia dating Michael Morbius and later Jason Phillips. Additionally, Felicia comes from a wealthy background as her mother is the head of the lucrative Hardy Foundation while her father, John Hardesky, was tricked by the Nazis into sneaking into an American lab during World War II to memorize the super-soldier formula that created Captain America and report back to the Red Skull. At the last moment, Hardesky realized the deception and ran away to a life of crime. In the present, he was held in a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison before the Kingpin breaks him out. On the Kingpin&#x27;s behalf, Doctor Octopus kidnaps Felicia as leverage and to use her as a guinea pig for an improved super-soldier formula and introduce her to the father that she never knew. The formula proves a success, enhancing her overall physical prowess and granting her the ability to transform between her normal blonde form and her empowered white haired form at will. Using her new power, she recruits Spider-Man to help her rescue Hardesky and destroy the super-soldier formula. After Morbius turns himself into a vampiric entity, Felicia grapples with her feelings for him while trying to stop him. Along the way, she joins forces with him, Spider-Man, and Blade to stop the Vampire Queen from creating an army of vampires. Following this, Felicia leaves New York to work with Blade and Morbius, though she returns to help Spider-Man defeat Hydro-Man, attend Spider-Man and Watson&#x27;s wedding, and help him and a group of superheroes combat a group of supervillains assembled by the Beyonder.
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appears in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, voiced by Tricia Helfer. This version does not have superpowers. She frequently flirts with Spider-Man until she tries and fails to break her father Walter Hardy out of prison, souring her relationship with Spider-Man.
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appears in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017), voiced by Grey DeLisle.
* Sony canceled its planned female team-up film &quot;Silver &amp; Black&quot; (see below) in August 2018 to rework it as two separate solo films focusing on each of the title characters — Felicia and Silver Sable. &quot;Silver &amp; Black&quot;″s planned director Gina Prince-Bythewood was expected to remain involved as a producer. By January 2020, the project was believed to be in development as a television series, which Prince-Bythewood confirmed in April 2020. She suggested that it could be a limited series, and had the potential to be released on Disney+.
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appears in &quot;Spidey and His Amazing Friends&quot;, voiced by Jaiden Klein. This version is significantly younger than other incarnations and is primarily obsessed with shiny objects. Additionally, she hates being called by her real name.

===Film===
* Felicia Hardy / Black Cat appeared in early scripts for &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; as part of a subplot in which she tries to convince Spider-Man to give up being Peter Parker. This idea was to contrast with the other subplot of Peter giving up being Spider-Man. Though she was removed in later scripts, the Black Cat and her subplot are used in the film&#x27;s tie-in video game. Felicia Hardy was then supposed to appear in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; as a secondary love interest of Parker&#x27;s, though she would not have transformed into the Black Cat, as in the comics. Instead, Raimi&#x27;s Felicia was expected to become a new super-powered figure called the Vulturess. In March 2013, Raimi stated that Anne Hathaway would have played Black Cat if &quot;Spider-Man 4&quot; had been made.
* Felicia Hardy appears in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, portrayed by Felicity Jones. This version works for Oscorp and has a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the Osborns. After taking control of the company, Harry Osborn promotes Hardy over members of Norman Osborn&#x27;s former inner circle. She was intended to become the Black Cat in future films in the series before it was cancelled.
* In March 2017, it was officially reported that Sony Pictures was developing a Black Cat and Silver Sable-centered film with writer Christopher Yost, a project previously revealed following the Sony Pictures hack in 2014, with Jones intended to reprise her role as Hardy from &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;. It was intended to be a part of a shared universe called Sony&#x27;s Spider-Man Universe, which is centered on characters from the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; mythology and began with the live-action film &quot;Venom&quot; in 2018. The films were to be more adult-oriented and despite taking place in the &quot;same reality&quot; as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, would not crossover with each other. In May 2017, it was announced that Gina Prince-Bythewood would direct the film, now titled &quot;Silver &amp; Black&quot;. Production was supposed to begin in March 2018, but has since been delayed &quot;indefinitely&quot;. Prince-Bythewood said the cause of the delay was script issues. While the film was initially scheduled to be released on February 8, 2019, Sony removed the release date from their schedule. Production was now slated to begin in 2019. In August 2018, Sony announced that &quot;Silver &amp; Black&quot; was canceled in favor of having both characters starring in their own feature films. &quot;Black Cat&quot; was reportedly a re-worked version of the &quot;Silver &amp; Black&quot; script while the studio were searching for screenwriters for &quot;Silver Sable&quot;. Prince-Bythewood would have served as a producer on both projects. As of April 2020, the film is now believed to be cancelled in favor of the proposed television series.

Following her defeat, Black Cat reveals that she is actually a double agent trying to thwart the Kingpin&#x27;s illegal activities in an attempt to impress Spider-Man, for whom she still has feelings. The player is then presented with the choice of rejecting or returning her feelings. If the latter choice is made, Spider-Man will work with Black Cat against the Kingpin.

Though she escaped after realizing the extent of Alchemax&#x27;s corruption, they created clones of her as a security force. One clone in particular was given the Vanisher&#x27;s teleportation powers, instilled with extreme agoraphobia so that she would not be tempted to escape their corporate headquarters, upgraded with cybernetic weaponry, given claws on her fingers, and led to believe they force-fed her anti-aging pills. After defeating several other Black Cat clones, Spider-Man encounters and fights the special clone. Following her defeat, Black Cat implies that she still has feelings for him before disappearing. Later, when Spider-Man 2099 sets off to confront Alchemax&#x27;s CEO, he is forced to fight the remaining Black Cat clones along with other Alchemax guards.

<text>The &#x27; (‘Canuleian law’), or &#x27;, was a law of the Roman Republic, passed in the year 445 BC, restoring the right of (marriage) between patricians and plebeians.

==Canuleius&#x27; first rogation==
Five years earlier, as part of the process of establishing the Twelve Tables of Roman law, the second decemvirate had placed severe restrictions on the plebeian order, including a prohibition on the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians.

Gaius Canuleius, one of the tribunes of the plebs, proposed a &quot;rogatio&quot; repealing this law. The consuls, Marcus Genucius Augurinus and Gaius Curtius Philo, vehemently opposed Canuleius, arguing that the tribune was proposing nothing less than the breakdown of Rome&#x27;s social and moral fabric, at a time when the city was faced with external threats.

Undeterred, Canuleius reminded the people of the many contributions of Romans of lowly birth, including several of the kings, and pointed out that the Senate had willingly given Roman citizenship to defeated enemies, even while maintaining that the marriage of patricians and plebeians would be detrimental to the state. He then proposed that, in addition to restoring the right of &quot;conubium&quot;, the law should be changed to allow plebeians to hold the consulship; all but one of the other tribunes supported this measure.

An ill-chosen remark by the consul Curtius, to the effect that the children of mixed marriages might incur the displeasure of the gods, thereby preventing the proper taking of auspices, inflamed the people to the extent at which the consuls yielded to their demands, allowing a vote on Canuleius&#x27; original &quot;rogatio&quot;. The prohibition on intermarriage between patricians and plebeians was thus repealed.

==Second proposal==
The second question, however, permitting plebeians to stand for the consulship, was not brought to a vote. The senator Gaius Claudius Sabinus, brother of one of the decemvirs, argued vehemently against it, and urged that force be used against the tribunes when they obstructed a levy of troops unless the Senate agreed to consider the law. This radical escalation was prevented by his colleague, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, and his brother, Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus.

Claudius then suggested that military tribunes with consular power might be elected from either order, instead of consuls; but he was not willing to bring the matter forward himself, delegating the distasteful matter to Titus Genucius, brother of the consul, who was of a mind to compromise with the plebeians. This proposal was well-received, and the first consular tribunes were elected for the following year, BC 444.

==In popular culture==
In the novel, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, set in an English boarding school in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the schoolmaster Mr. Chipping describes the law to his Roman history class, suggesting a pun that could be used as a mnemonic device:

&quot;So that, you see, if Miss Plebs wanted Mr. Patrician to marry her, and he said he couldn&#x27;t, she probably replied: &#x27;Oh yes, you &quot;can, you liar&quot;!&#x27; &quot; (emphasis supplied).

<text>Roy Allen (1918–1991) was an American, born in the north Philadelphia neighborhood of Olney. He was a bomber pilot during World War II, when he was shot down over France and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
== France and captivity ==
On June 14, 1944, pilot Roy Allen and the crew of his Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress embarked on a mission over Nazi-occupied France. Hit by flak, Roy was forced to parachute into France. 

Trapped behind enemy lines, he was rescued by Colette Florin, a 21-year-old schoolteacher and a member of the French Resistance. He stayed with Colette for six weeks until he was able to be moved into Paris. Once he arrived in Paris, a man told him that he was taking him to another agent who would then sneak him into Spain and then take him to England. The agent who was taking him to his supposed &quot;British Agent&quot;, who went by the name Captain Jacques, betrayed him, turning him over to the Gestapo. He was then taken to Avenue Foch which was the Gestapo&#x27;s headquarters for all of France at that time. At Avenue Foch, he was tortured, labelled a terrorist and deprived of his rights as a Prisoner of War under the terms of the Geneva Convention. He and other airmen were then taken to Fresnes Prison in the town of Fresnes, Val-de-Marne, seven miles south of Paris. As the front neared them, the Germans decided to ship Roy Allen and 167 other Allied airmen, including Phil Lamason, to the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany. They left Fresnes, traveling by train in cattle cars. The cars were designed to hold up to 40 men. The Germans loaded them with 90, forcing their passengers to stand for the duration of the trip.

=== Buchenwald concentration camp ===
In Buchenwald, Allen suffered from extensive physical and psychological abuse. By the time he left, he weighed a mere , almost lighter than when he left for his mission back on June 14. While there, he suffered from dysentery, pneumonia and various other illnesses. The harsh treatment endured by Allen and the other airmen at Buchenwald was a blatant violation of the Third Geneva Convention, which specifically prohibits the physical and mental abuse of captured service personnel, and states that they must be treated humanely. This explains the reason for the SS guards issuing the airmen with inmate uniforms with no serial numbers.

Later, Hannes Trautloft an officer from the Luftwaffe inspecting Allied bomb damage came across the Allied airmen. One of the prisoners, who spoke fluent German, highlighted their case to the officer. Sympathetic to their plight (and also aware that Luftwaffe POWs in Allied hands could suffer reprisals if he did not intervene), the German officer organized their transfer from Buchenwald to a legitimate prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag Luft III in what is now Poland.

<text>Keith Pollard (; born January 20, 1950) is an American comic book artist. Originally from the Detroit area, Pollard is best known for his simultaneous work on the Marvel Comics titles &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;Thor&quot; in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

==Career==
Keith Pollard made his professional comics debut in 1974 with stints on such titles as &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot;, and &quot;Black Goliath&quot;. In the mid 1970s he also drew original covers for some of the weekly titles in the Marvel UK imprint. He was the regular penciller of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; from issue #186 (Nov. 1978) through issue #205 (June 1980) and pencilled the backup feature in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #15 (1981). With writer Marv Wolfman, Pollard introduced the Black Cat in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #194 (July 1979). Wolfman and Pollard were the creative team for both &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #200 (Nov. 1978) and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #200 (Jan. 1980).

Pollard was also the regular penciler of &quot;Thor&quot; issues #286–320. In 1982, Pollard moved to DC Comics where he drew part of &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #300 (Feb. 1983) and launched the &quot;Vigilante&quot; series with Marv Wolfman. He and Elliot S. Maggin co-created the Kristin Wells version of Superwoman in &quot;DC Comics Presents Annual&quot; #2 (1983).

In 1987, he returned to Marvel where he had a second run on &quot;Fantastic Four,&quot; with writer Steve Englehart, that lasted until 1989. Afterwards, he pencilled &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; #2–10.

Pollard and Stan Lee produced the &quot;Silver Surfer: The Enslavers&quot; graphic novel in 1990. In the early 1990s, he drew all the character profiles for the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition&quot;.

Pollard left comics in 1996, though he occasionally makes appearances at comic book conventions. He returned to comics in 2019 with a story for &quot;DC Primal Age Giant&quot;, written by Marv Wolfman.

<doc id="663302" wikidata="Q1074210" url="?curid=663302" title="Clonorchis sinensis">
<text>Clonorchis sinensis, the Chinese liver fluke, is a liver fluke belonging to the class Trematoda, phylum Platyhelminthes. It infects fish-eating mammals, including humans. In humans, it infects the common bile duct and gall bladder, feeding on bile. It was discovered by British physician James McConnell at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta (Kolkata) in 1874. The first description was given by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it &quot;Distoma sinense&quot;. The fluke passes its lifecycle in three different hosts, namely freshwater snail as first intermediate hosts, freshwater fish as second intermediate host, and mammals as definitive hosts.

Endemic to Asia and Russia, &quot;C. sinensis&quot; is the most prevalent human fluke in Asia and third-most in the world. It is still actively transmitted in Korea, China, Vietnam, and Russia. Most infections (about 85%) occur in China. The infection, called clonorchiasis, generally appears as jaundice, indigestion, biliary inflammation, bile duct obstruction, and even liver cirrhosis, cholangiocarcinoma, and hepatic carcinoma.

As a major causative agent of bile duct cancer, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified &quot;C. sinensis&quot; as a group 1 biological carcinogen in 2009.

==Discovery==
The symptoms of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; infection (clonorchiasis) have been known from ancient times in China. The earliest record is from corpses buried in 278 BC at Jiangling County of Hubei Province and the Warring States tomb of the western Han Dynasty. The parasite was discovered only in 1874, though, by James McConnell, a professor of pathology and resident physician at the Medical College Hospital in Calcutta. He recovered the fluke from a 20-year-old Chinese carpenter who died on 8 September 1874. On autopsy, he observed that the corpse had a swollen liver (hepatomegaly) and distended bile ducts, which he noted were blocked by &quot;small, dark, vermicular-looking bodies.&quot; He recovered the &quot;vermicules&quot; (worms) and compared them with known flukes &quot;Fasciola hepatica&quot; and &quot;Distoma lanceolatum&quot;. He concluded that the new fluke was significantly different. He published his observations in the 21 August 1875 issue of &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

The formal scientific description was published in 1875 by Thomas Spencer Cobbold, who named it &quot;Distoma sinense&quot;. In 1876, Rudolf Leuckart named it &quot;Distomum spithulatum&quot;. Kenso Ishisaka recorded the first case of clonorchiasis in Japan in 1877. McConnell identified another infection in a Chinese cook from Hong Kong in 1878. Erwin von Baelz reported the presence of similar flukes from an autopsy of a Japanese patient at Tokyo University in 1883. He recorded two different forms, naming the smaller, more pathogenic form as &quot;Distoma hepatis endemicum sive perniciosum&quot;, and the larger, less pathogenic form as &quot;D.h.e.s. innocuum&quot;. Isao Ijima correctly redescribed them as the same species, but still wrongly renamed it &quot;Distoma endemicum&quot; in 1886. When a new genus &quot;Opisthorchis&quot; was created by Émile Blanchard in 1895, Cobbold&#x27;s species name &quot;D. sinense&quot; was moved to the new genus because of close similarities with the other members. Further analyses by Arthur Looss, though, showed significant differences from the general features of &quot;Opisthorchis&quot;, particularly on the highly branched testes. He created a new genus &quot;Clonorchis&quot; (from Greek &quot;klon&quot; meaning &quot;twig/branch&quot;, &quot;orkhis&quot; meaning &quot;testis&quot;) in 1907. Similar to Baelz, he differentiated the larger species as &quot;Clonorchis sinensis&quot;, which is mostly found in China, and the smaller species as &quot;C. endemicum&quot;, found mostly in Japan. In 1912, Harujiro Kobayashi corrected the classification that the differences in sizes were due to the nature of the host and intensity of infection, and had nothing to do with the biology. Hence, he supported only &quot;C. sinensis&quot;. Kobayashi was also the first to discover fish as the second intermediate host in 1911. Masatomo Muto discovered snails as the first intermediate host in 1918.

==Description==

An adult &quot;C. sinensis&quot; is a flattened (dorsoventrally) and leaf-shaped fluke. The body is slightly elongated and slender, measuring 15–20 mm in length and 3–4 mm in width. It narrows at the anterior region into a small opening called the oral sucker, which act as the mouth. From the mouth, two tubes called caeca run the length of body. They are the digestive and excretory tracts. The posterior end is broad and blunt. A poorly developed ventral sucker lies behind the oral sucker, at about one-fourth of the body length from the anterior end. A common genital pore opens just in front of it. As a hermaphrodite, it has both male and female reproductive organs. A single rounded ovary is at the centre of the body, and two testes are towards the posterior end. The uterus from the ovary, and seminal ducts from the testes, meet and open at the genital pore. The testes are highly branched. Other highly branched organs called vitellaria (or vitelline glands) are distributed on either side of the body.

The eggs are similar to those of other related flukes such as &quot;Opisthorchis viverrini&quot; and &quot;O. felineus&quot;, and are often confused during diagnosis. They small and oval in shape, measuring about 30 x 15 μm in diameter. They are sharply curved and with a clear convex operculum towards the narrower end. At the broader end is a stem-shaped knob. The miracidium can be seen inside the fertilised egg.

== Life cycle ==

===Production of eggs===

The eggs of a &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are released through the biliary tract, and excreted out along with the faeces. The eggs are embryonated and contain the larvae called miracidia. Unlike most other flukes in which the miracidia undergo development and swim in water to infect suitable host, the eggs of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are simply deposited in water. The eggs are then eaten by snails.

=== First intermediate host ===
Freshwater snail &quot;Parafossarulus manchouricus&quot; often serves as a first intermediate host for &quot;C. sinensis&quot; in China, Japan, Korea, and Russia. Other snail hosts include &quot;Alocinma longicornis&quot;, &quot;Bithynia longicornis&quot;, &quot;Bithynia fuchsiana&quot;, &quot;Bithynia misella&quot;, &quot;Parafossarulus anomalospiralis&quot;, &quot;Melanoides tuberculata&quot;, &quot;Semisulcospira cancellata&quot;, &quot;Koreoleptoxis amurensis&quot;, &quot;Semisulcospira libertina&quot;, and &quot;Assiminea lutea&quot; in China; and &quot;Melanoides tuberculata&quot; in Vietnam.

Once inside of the snail body, the embryonic membrane is dissolved by the snail&#x27;s digestive enzymes, so the miracidium hatches from the egg. The ciliated miracidium can move about, penetrating the intestine, and enters the haemocoel and digestive gland. Here, it undergoes metamorphosis into a sporocyst. The sporocyst gives rise to small larvae called rediae. The rediae burst out from the sporocyst to become the next-stage larvae called cercaria. This system of asexual reproduction allows for an exponential multiplication of cercaria individuals from one miracidium. This aids the fluke in reproduction, because it enables the miracidium to capitalize on one-chance occasion of passively being eaten by a snail before the egg dies. The mature cercariae bore out of the snail body into the freshwater environment. However, they are nonfeeding and must find a fish host within 2–3 days, otherwise they die.

The cercariae of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; are different from those of other flukes in that they do not swim. Instead, they initially hang upside down in the water, and then sink to the bottom. They rise to the water surface to resume their initial position, and the movement is repeated again. They attack fish when they feel any disturbance.

=== Second intermediate host ===
When they detect fish, they attach themselves on the scales using their suckers. Boring their way into the fish&#x27;s body, they penetrate into the fish muscle within 6 to 13 minutes. Within an hour of penetration, they develop hard coverings called cysts and become metacercariae. This protective cyst is useful when the fish muscle is consumed. The metacercariae gradually develop and become infective to their next hosts after 3 to 4 weeks.

The common second intermediate hosts are freshwater fish such as common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), grass carp (&quot;Ctenopharyngodon idellus&quot;), crucian carp (&quot;Carassius carassius&quot;), goldfish (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;), &quot;Pseudorasbora parva&quot;, &quot;Abbottina rivularis&quot;, &quot;Hemiculter&quot; spp., &quot;Opsariichthys&quot; spp., &quot;Rhodeus&quot; spp., &quot;Sarcocheilichthys&quot; spp., &quot;Zacco platypus&quot;, &quot;Nipponocypris temminckii&quot;, and pond smelt (&quot;Hypomesus olidus&quot;). In China, 102 species of fish and four species of shrimp are known to be the intermediate hosts. In Korea, 40 species of freshwater fish are recorded as hosts. Seven species of fish are known as hosts in Russia.

=== Definitive host ===

Humans are the major definitive hosts. Infection occurs when raw or undercooked fish contaminated with the metacercariae is eaten. The cysts of the metacercariae are gradually digested by the human gastric acids, and upon reaching the small intestines, the entire cyst is lost. The free metacercariae penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enter the bile ducts. Migration into the bile ducts takes 1–2 days. They start feeding on the bile secreted from the liver, and gradually grow. They become adults in about a month, and start laying eggs. The average lifespan of an adult fluke is 30 years. An individual fluke can produce 4,000 eggs in a day.

Other definitive hosts are fish-eating mammals such as dogs, cats, rats, pigs, badgers, weasels, camels, and buffaloes.

==Prevalence==

&quot;C. sinensis&quot; is estimated to be the third-most prevalent worm parasite in the world. It is endemic to Russia, Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam. In Asia it is the most prevalent human trematode, with over 15 million people estimated to be infected and 200 million people at constant risk of infection. China has the highest incidence with about 13 million infections, accounting for 85% of the total cases.
Infection rates are generally higher in men, fishermen, farmers, businessmen, and catering staff. The infection is more serious in adults aged 40–60 and the elderly. More cases occur in low- or middle-class countries, increasing the disease burden and creating economic problems. Clonorchiasis causes 275,370 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) globally. The calculated economic burden for treating clonorchiasis-related ailments in the Guangdong Province of China alone was $200 million by 2010.

The type of freshwater fishes and shrimp that are infected by &quot;C. sinensis&quot; contributes to the prevalence of infection. Commonly eaten fishes (e.g. &quot;C. idellus&quot;, &quot;C. auratus&quot;, &quot;H. nobilis&quot;, &quot;C. carpio&quot;, &quot;H. molitrix&quot;, and &quot;M. anguillicaudatus&quot;) were found to have the metacercariae when sampled from lakes, rivers, and markets. In total, almost 31 types of freshwater fish and shrimp were found to carry the parasite.

== Effects on human health ==
Dwelling in the bile ducts, &quot;C. sinensis&quot; induces an inflammatory reaction, epithelial hyperplasia, and sometimes even cholangiocarcinoma, the incidence of which is raised in fluke-infested areas.

One adverse effect of &quot;Clonorchis&quot; spp. is the possibility for the adult metacercaria to consume all bile created in the liver, which would inhibit the host human from digesting food, especially fats. Another possibility is obstruction of the bile duct by the parasite or its eggs, leading to biliary obstruction and cholangitis (specifically oriental cholangitis).

Unusual cases of liver abscesses due to clonorchiasis have been reported. Liver abscesses may be seen even without dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts.

=== Symptoms ===
While normally asymptomatic, most pathological manifestations result from inflammation and intermittent obstruction of the biliary ducts. The acute phase consists of abdominal pain with associated nausea and diarrhea. Long-standing infections consist of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, and jaundice. The pathology of long-standing infections consist of bile stasis, obstruction, bacterial infections, inflammation, periductal fibrosis, and hyperplasia. Development of cholangiocarcinoma is progressive.

=== Diagnosis and treatment ===
Infection is detected mainly on identification of eggs by microscopic demonstration in faeces or in duodenal aspirate, but other sophisticated methods have been developed, such as ELISA, which has become the most important clinical technique. Diagnosis by detecting DNAs from eggs in faeces are also developed using PCR, real-time PCR, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification, which are highly sensitive and specific. 

Typical imaging features center around imaging of the liver with CT, ultrasound, or MRI for detection of primary biliary cirrhosis. Traits that raise suspicion for the infection include intra- and extrahepatic dilatation and structures with intraductal pigmented stones, usually in the absence of gallstones and with regions of segmental liver atrophy, particularly the lateral aspect of the left hepatic lobe. Also, reduced arborization of peripheral ducts is seen. A full 5% of chronic infections go on to develop cholangiocarcinoma.

Drugs used to treat infestation include triclabendazole, praziquantel, bithionol, albendazole, levamisole, and mebendazole. However, benzimidazoles are very weak as a vermicide. As with other trematodes, praziquantel is the drug of choice. Lately, tribendimidine has been acknowledged as an effective and safe drug.

==Genetics==

&quot;C. sinensis&quot; has 28 pairs of chromosomes (2n=56) in a cell. The chromosome pairs are groups in two: 8 large group and 20 small group. Structural variations are seen between those from different countries. The draft genome sequence was published in 2011. The total genome size is estimated to be 580 MB, and the GC content was calculated as about 43.85%. About 16,000 genes are predicted, out of which 13,634 genes have been identified.

<text>Jane Swinnerton (born 7 May 1954) is a former British field hockey player who won over 100 caps for England between 1977 and 1987. Swinnerton tied for the most goals scored in the 1991/92 season. She played most of her career with Sutton Coldfield Hockey Club. Arguably the greatest highlight of her club career was part of the Sutton Coldfield team that won the European championships in Vught, Holland in 1992. 
She was selected for two Olympic squads &#x27;80 &amp; &#x27;84 but never made it as political reasons meant certain teams were not allowed to travel in those years.

She has a long spell as England Ladies Manager, until she retired from that in 1997 for the birth of her first son Callum.

In 2010, Swinnerton was invited to take part in a Legends match prior to the national hockey championship. This was a &#x27;Wembley Legends&#x27; match for all ex England ladies players to celebrate the times they had playing on the grass at the old Wembley.

She played her last Hockey at Cannock, where she helped win promotion to the National League. She worked as a PE teacher in the south Staffordshire school &quot;Cannock Chase High School&quot; until 2012, when she retired.

<doc id="663342" wikidata="Q154418" url="?curid=663342" title="Josip Jelačić">
<text>Count Josip Jelačić von Bužim (16 October 180120 May 1859; also spelled &quot;Jellachich&quot;, &quot;Jellačić&quot; or &quot;Jellasics&quot;; ; ) was a Croatian lieutenant field marshal in the Imperial Austrian Army and politician. He was the Ban of Croatia between 23 March 1848 and 19 April 1859. He was a member of the House of Jelačić and a noted army general, remembered for his military campaigns during the Revolutions of 1848 and for his abolition of serfdom in Croatia.

== Early life and military ==
 The son of Croatian Baron Franjo Jelačić Bužimski (or in other documents, ) (1746–1810), a Feldmarschall-Leutnant (Lieutenant Field Marshal), and his wife, Baroness Anna Portner von Höflein, the honorific &quot;Bužimski&quot; refers to Bužim, a location in the Cazin region, that was used by the Jelačić family.

Jelačić was born in the town of Petrovaradin which was a part of the Slavonian Military Frontier of the Habsburg monarchy and today it is part of Vojvodina, Serbia. Josip Jelačić was educated in Vienna at the Theresian Military Academy, where he received a versatile education, showing particular interest in history and foreign languages. He was fluent in all South-Slavic languages, as well as German, Italian, French, and Hungarian. On the 11th of March 1819 Jelačić joined the Austrian army with the rank of lieutenant in the Vinko Freiherr von Knežević Regiment, named for his uncle.

In 1819, he served as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Cavalry Regiment in Galicia. In 1822, he fell ill and stayed in his parents&#x27; house in Zagreb. In 1825 he returned to his regiment in Vienna, where he was appointed first lieutenant and aide to the brigade commander. In 1830, he became a lieutenant captain in the Ogulin regiment.

On 17 October 1835, he led a military campaign against Bosnian Ottoman troops in Velika Kladuša for which he received a medal. He was promoted to major on 20 February 1837 in the Freiherr von Gollner regiment. In May 1841 he received the rank of lieutenant colonel in the 1st Croatian Frontier Guard Regiment in Glina, Croatia. On October 18, he was promoted to colonel.

On 22 March 1848, Jelačić was promoted to major-general, and simultaneously the Sabor (the National Assembly of Croatia) elected him as Ban of Croatia. The Sabor also declared that the first elections or representatives to the assembly would be held in May 1848. Shortly after, he was promoted to lieutenant field-marshal, becoming the commander of all Habsburg troops in Croatia.

During this time, Jelačić was a proponent of the Illyrian movement.

== Hungarian Revolution of 1848 ==

Jelačić supported independence for Croatia from the Austrian throne. However, in pursuit of this goal Jelačić sought to support this goal by ingratiating himself with the Austrian throne by supporting Austrian interests in putting down revolutionary movements in northern Italy in 1848 and in opposing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848–1849. Consequently, Jelačić&#x27;s reputation differs in Austria where he was looked upon as a rebel seeking to break up the Austrian Empire, while in Croatia he is deemed a national hero.

He travelled to Vienna to take oaths to become counsel of Austrian Emperor, Ferdinand I, but refused to take the oath as Ban of Croatia, because it was a Hungarian dependent territory. The relations between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Austrian government deteriorated after the outbreak of the Hungarian Revolution on 15 March 1848. But Jelačić later took the oath as Ban of Croatia on 5 June 1848. Because of the absence of Juraj Haulik, the Catholic Archbishop of Zagreb, he took the oath before the Josif Rajačić, the Orthodox Archbishop of Karlovci and Serbian Patriarch.

Jelačić, now Ban, supported the Croatian aim to maintain autonomy from the Kingdom of Hungary. Jelačić proceeded to sever all official ties of Croatia from Hungary. The Austrian Imperial Court initially opposed this act as one of disobedience and separatism, declaring him to be a rebel and the Sabor to be illegitimate. But the court soon realized Jelačić and his Croatian army were an ally against the newly formed Batthyány Government. Travelling back to Zagreb in April, Jelačić refused to cede to this new government, refused any cooperation, and called for elections to the Sabor on 25 March 1848.

== Croatian Parliament, the Sabor ==

The Sabor – now acting as the National Assembly – declared the following demands to the Habsburg emperor:

# The union of all Croatian provinces (Croatian-Slavonian Kingdom, Istria and Dalmatia).
# Separation from the Kingdom of Hungary.
# Abolition of serfdom.
# Full civil rights.
# Affirmation of the equality of nations.

Many of his points about civil rights were part of the Hungarian twelve points, and were already enacted by the Batthyány Government.

The Sabor strongly opposed the &quot;massive nationalist Magyarization politics of the Kingdom of Hungary from the Carpathians to Adria, which the newly formed government represents, especially Lajos Kossuth.&quot;

On 8 April Jelačić took his oath as ban and was appointed a field-marshal-lieutenant and made commander of the Military Frontier. On 19 April 1848 Jelačić proclaimed the union of Croatian provinces, and the separation from the Kingdom of Hungary. At the same time, he proclaimed unconditional loyalty to the Habsburg monarchy. The Croatian Constitution of 24 April 1848 declared &quot;languages of all ethnicities should be inviolable&quot;.

On serfdom, it was apparent that changing the status of the Croatian peasantry would have to wait until the end of the revolution. Jelačić kept up the institution of the Military Frontier so he could draft more soldiers. The people in the region protested to this, but Ban Jelačić quashed the dissent by summary courts martial and by executing many dissenters.

In May, Jelačić established the &quot;Bansko Vijeće&quot; (&quot;Ban Council&quot;). Its scope of authority covered ministerial tasks including Internal Affairs, Justice, Schools and Education, Religion, Finance, and Defense, so this council was acting as a governing body in Croatia. The new Sabor was summoned on 5 June.

== Intermediary discussions ==
The Austrian emperor called Jelačić to Innsbruck, to which the Imperial Court had fled, and the Emperor there told him that the Croatian and Slavonian troops in the Italian provinces wanted to join forces with those in Croatia, but that this would weaken the forces in Italy. So Jelačić called on all troops stationed in the Italian provinces to remain calm and to stay put.

The Austrian court did not grant the separation of Croatia from Hungary. During his travels back to Zagreb, Jelačić read in the Lienz railway station that on 10 June the Emperor had relieved him of all his positions. But Jelačić was still loyal to the Emperor, and kept relations with the Imperial Court, especially with Archduchess Sophia, the mother of Franz Joseph I of Austria.

Immediately after arriving at Zagreb, Jelačić got the order to join the discussions with the Hungarian government in Vienna. During these, Jelačić stated that his position was derived from the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, while Lajos Batthyány called him &quot;a separatist&quot; seeking to break away from the Habsburg Monarchy. Jelačić called this a &quot;rebellion&quot;. Batthyány warned Jelačić that this could mean war. Jelačić stopped the discussions, saying that &quot;civil war is the worst that could happen&quot; – but that he &quot;would not be intimidated by this, however shocking it might be to hear&quot;. Negotiations were closed with Batthyány saying &quot;see you (on the river) Drava&quot; and with Jelačić responding &quot;say rather on the Danube.&quot;

Jelačić returned to Croatia. Hungarian troops had gathered on the border and hostile proclamations were made against him.

== War against the Kingdom of Hungary ==
In August, Jelačić proclaimed a decree for the Croatians, where he denied accusations of separating Croatia in the name of Panslavism. In the decree he said
His closing words were:

Jelačić felt disorder growing in the Austrian Empire, and decided on immediate action. On 11 September at Varaždin he crossed the River Drava. His fighting force was limited, due to many of his soldiers fighting in Northern Italy.

Jelačić occupied Međimurje (), which was mostly Croatian. The two forces were poorly armed because of the rapid engagement. Materiel was not well organised, so the advance into Hungarian territory was difficult. Supplies were taken from the local population.

The enthusiasm of the Croatian troops grew when at Siófok the Ban received a letter from Ferdinand I cancelling the decree removing him from all positions, also promoting him to be general commander of all troops in Hungary.

During his march toward Pest and Buda (now conjoined as the towns of Budapest), Jelačić got a message from Archduke Stephen, situated in Veszprém, to inform him of the decision of the Emperor that Lajos Batthyány was approved to set up a new government, and calling him to stop the troops, and to discuss further actions at his office. Jelačić replied he could not stop his army then, but was prepared for discussions with the archduke at the port of Balatonszemes. The meeting did not take place. According to Austrian sources, advisors to Jelačić persuaded him not to attend, because of a threat of assassination by agents of the Hungarian Government. After this fiasco, Palatine Stephen resigned and left Hungary, under the Emperor&#x27;s orders.

=== Battle of Pákozd ===

Jelačić&#x27;s army occupied Székesfehérvár on 26 September 1848. The same day the Emperor appointed lieutenant-general Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg as general commanding all troops in Hungary, but this was annulled by the Hungarian Parliament. Lajos Kossuth called the Hungarians for resistance, and the &quot;Országos Honvédelmi Bizottmány&quot; (National Homeguarding Committee) was given the power of execution. Lamberg, trying to take over the command of the Hungarian troops was identified and killed.

Jelačić advanced onward, reached Lake Velence on 29 September, where he met Hungarian troops. After the first strikes, lieutenant-general János Móga withdrew to north to Sukoró. Jelačić demanded Móga stand against the rebels, and &quot;get back to the road of honour and duty&quot;, but Móga refused, and his army attacked Jelačić between his position and Pákozd.

After his defeat at the Battle of Pákozd, on 30 September Jelačić asked for a three-day ceasefire; he wanted to use these days to wait for Roth&#x27;s army. He assessed the greater numbers of the Hungarian troops and the poor armaments and tiredness of his own troops. On 1 October the supply routes to Croatia were cut by rebels, so he advanced toward Vienna. On 3 October Móga was pursuing after Jelačić, but did not want to make an attack.

On 4 October, Ferdinand I of Austria reappointed Jelačić as the general commander of all troops in Hungary, and dissolved the Hungarian Diet.

=== Vienna Revolt ===

Austrian Minister of War Theodor Baillet von Latour called the guards in Vienna to join the troops of Jelačić, but this caused an uprising in Vienna on 6 October in which Latour was killed.

On 7 October Hungarian General Mór Perczel defeated the armies of General Roth and Josip Filipović, and took them prisoner. The Hungarian Parliament annulled the Emperor&#x27;s decree of October 4.

Jelačić moved onward to Vienna to join the troops around the city. Under Lieutenant-General Kuzman Todorović, he organised a body of 14,000 soldiers to move south to Styria to protect Croatia.

The Viennese revolution committee called for aid from the Hungarian Government. On 10 October at Laaer Berg near Vienna, Jelačić joined Austrian troops led by Auersperg, and the army was strengthened with troops from Bratislava, a regiment of Ludwig von Wallmoden-Gimborn and Franz Joseph I of Austria&#x27;s regiment. Jelačić&#x27;s forces were soon under Field Marshal Windisch-Grätz. On 21 October, seeing trouble ahead, Móga stopped at the Austrian border, and the revolution in Vienna was suppressed. Jelačić&#x27;s forces were fighting in the Landstrasse, Erdberg and Weissgerber suburbs.

=== The winter campaign of Windisch-Grätz ===


On 21 October – too late – Lajos Kossuth ordered Móga to turn back to Vienna, they met forces of Jelačić at Schwechat on 30 October. A day of artillery fighting broke out, and Jelačić initiated a counterattack in the evening. Led by General , the attack pushed back the Hungarian forces and defeated them. After this defeat, Móga stepped down as general commander, and Kossuth nominated general Artúr Görgey in his place.

On 2 December 1848 Ferdinand I of Austria abdicated, and Franz Joseph I of Austria was installed as Emperor. On 13 December Windisch-Grätz crossed the Hungarian border. On 16 December, Jelačić also crossed the border and defeated Hungarian troops at Parndorf, later occupying Mosonmagyaróvár and Győr. Being informed that Mór Perczel was stationed at Mór, Jelačić made a detour toward this city and defeated the Hungarian troops there, taking into custody 23 officers and 2,000 honvéd. With this battle, Pest-Buda became vulnerable, so the Hungarian government fled to Debrecen. Görgey could resist the march of Jelačić at Tétény for some time, but on 5 January Windisch-Grätz, together with Jelačić occupied Pest-Buda.

=== Later military campaigns ===
After the occupation of Pest and Buda the larger campaigns were over. Windisch-Grätz declared a military dictatorship, caught the Hungarian leader Lajos Batthyány and asked for surrender. He moved to Debrecen but was stopped by Perczel at Szolnok and Abony. Kossuth nominated Henryk Dembiński to replace Artúr Görgey, and started a strategic counterattack but was defeated near Kápolna.

Windisch-Grätz ordered Jelačić to quick march to Jászfényszaru. On 4 April Klapka attacked him but at Tápióbicske the bayonets of Jelačić pushed them back. On 5 March Damjanich reoccupied Szolnok. Jelačić now got a new order to turn from Jászfényszaru and head to Gödöllő. On 4 April Jelačić met János Damjanich at Tápióbicske and was defeated. On 6 April Windisch-Grätz and Jelačić, were defeated in the Battle of Isaszeg and retreated.

After the defeat, Windisch-Grätz was relieved of general command, and was replaced by General Welden and later Julius Jacob von Haynau. Jelačić was ordered to gather the scattered troops in southern Hungary and to organise an army. This consisted of 15,800 infantry, 5,100 cavalry and 74 cannon, and moved to Osijek immediately. During his march south, Jelačić had to suppress rebellions, especially in Pécs. After a series of wrong decisions, Jelačić&#x27;s army could not join up with the Emperor&#x27;s, so it was put to defensive fights.

=== Battles in Slavonia ===

In May, 1849 Jelačić moved from Osijek to Vukovar, Ilok, Sremski Karlovci, Tovarnik and Irig. He set up base at Ruma.

He was in a bad situation, as the Austrians were calling for the help of Russian Empire to suppress the Hungarians and the support from Vienna dissolved. Jelačić was lacking proper materiel, and many of his troops died of cholera.

The Serbian troops, led by Kuzman Todorović, had to surrender strategic points to the Honvédség (Hungarian Army). The Hungarians occupied and fortified Petrovaradin, where the troops received supplies because the population supported the Hungarian revolution. In April, Mór Perczel occupied Srbobran and broke up the encirclement of Petrovaradin, defeated Todorović so he could occupy Pančevo and finally, together with Józef Bem, occupied Temes County (now Timiș County, Romania).

Jelačić, cut off from all supplies, fortified his armies for defence and fought small battles in Slavonia. The supplies from the Austrian Empire were stuck at Stari Slankamen. In June he decided to break out and advance to Sombor – Dunaföldvár. During his march, on 6 June, Perczel attacked him near Kać and Žabalj. He defeated Perczel, and marched forward, but could not occupy Novi Sad.

On 24 June he successfully occupied Óbecse, but was retaken by Hungarians on 28th. This way Jelačić could not dislodge the Hungarian forces from Bačka. On 6 July Richard Guyon drove out the Croatian troops at Mali Iđoš. On 14 July Hungarians took control over Feketić and Lovćenac, defeating Jelačić in the Battle of Hegyes and forcing him to retreat. This was the last battle in the region.

After Timișoara fell, Jelačić joined Haynau&#x27;s troops, and after the end of the revolution, he travelled to Vienna to take part in discussions of reorganising Croatia, Slavonia and the frontier regions.

== After the Revolution ==
When peace was restored, Jelačić returned to Croatia where he was treated as national hero, the saviour of the homeland.
After the war the Empire&#x27;s new constitution stripped the local authorities in Hungary of their political power, but this punishment also affected Croatia despite its assistance to the imperial cause during the revolution. Nevertheless, Jelačić implemented the new Constitution (published 4 March 1849), and proceeded to outlaw various newspapers that published anti-Austrian opinions. In 1851, when Baron Alexander von Bach came to power in the Kingdom of Hungary, Jelačić worked under him and made no objections to the Germanization of Croatia. He remained in office until his death.

== Death and legacy ==

Jelačić died on 20 May 1859 in Zagreb, after an illness. He is buried in Zaprešić, in a grave near his castle.

In his time and shortly after, Jelačić was a fairly unpopular figure among the Croatian political elite, including Ante Starčević and others, and especially among the people who suffered losses due to his military campaigns and had little benefit from his economic measures.

Today, Jelačić is considered an important and admirable figure in Croatian history, alongside Ante Starčević, and Stjepan Radić, the Croatian political leader until 1928. The central square of the city of Zagreb was named Ban Jelačić Square in 1848, and a statue of him by Anton Dominik Fernkorn was erected in the square in 1866, removed under Communist rule in 1947, and reinstalled in 1990, after the fall of Communism.

In 2020, the home in which Jelačić was born was returned to the Croatian minority to be used as a cultural centre after being purchased by the Serbian government. It was officially opened on the 219th anniversary of Jelačić&#x27;s birth in a ceremony attended by the President of Serbia Aleksandar Vučić and Croatia&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs Gordan Grlić Radman.

The patriotic song &quot;Ustani bane&quot; (&quot;Rise, Ban&quot;) was written to glorify Jelačić.

In Hungary, he is a very unpopular historical figure. He is often referred to as &quot;Jelasics the coward,&quot; who &quot;runs back to Vienna with his army beaten&quot;, quote from Sándor Petőfi&#x27;s poem &quot;A vén zászlótartó&quot;.

Jelačić&#x27;s portrait was depicted on the obverse of the Croatian 20 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2001.

In 2008, a total of 211 streets in Croatia were named after Josip Jelačić, making him the fourth most common person eponym of streets in the country.

==Marriage and issue ==

In 1850, in Napajedla, he married young Countess Sophie von Stockau (1834–1877), daughter of Count Georg Adolf von Stockau (1806–1865) and his wife, Countess Franziska von Fünfkirchen (1801–1870). Her father was an illegitimate son of Duchess Therese of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and her lover, Count Maximilian von Lerchenfeld-Köfering-Schönberg (1772–1809), which made him related to almost all European reigning families. Josip and Sophie had one daughter:

<text>In computational complexity theory, a function problem is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem. For function problems, the output is not simply &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27;.

== Formal definition ==
A functional problem formula_1 is defined by a relation formula_2 over strings of an arbitrary alphabet formula_3:

: formula_4

An algorithm solves formula_1 if for every input formula_6 such that there exists a formula_7 satisfying formula_8, the algorithm produces one such formula_7, and if there are no such formula_7, it rejects.

A promise function problem is allowed to do anything (thus may not terminate) if no such formula_7 exists.

== Examples ==
A well-known function problem is given by the Functional Boolean Satisfiability Problem, FSAT for short. The problem, which is closely related to the SAT decision problem, can be formulated as follows:

:Given a boolean formula formula_12 with variables formula_13, find an assignment formula_14 such that formula_12 evaluates to formula_16 or decide that no such assignment exists.

In this case the relation formula_2 is given by tuples of suitably encoded boolean formulas and satisfying assignments.
While a SAT algorithm, fed with a formula formula_12, only needs to return &quot;unsatisfiable&quot; or &quot;satisfiable&quot;, an FSAT algorithm needs to return some satisfying assignment in the latter case.

Other notable examples include the travelling salesman problem, which asks for the route taken by the salesman, and the integer factorization problem, which asks for the list of factors.

== Relationship to other complexity classes ==
Consider an arbitrary decision problem formula_19 in the class NP. By the definition of NP, each problem instance formula_6 that is answered &#x27;yes&#x27; has a polynomial-size certificate formula_7 which serves as a proof for the &#x27;yes&#x27; answer. Thus, the set of these tuples formula_22 forms a relation, representing the function problem &quot;given formula_6 in formula_19, find a certificate formula_7 for formula_6&quot;. This function problem is called the &quot;function variant&quot; of formula_19; it belongs to the class FNP.

FNP can be thought of as the function class analogue of NP, in that solutions of FNP problems can be efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time in terms of the length of the input) &quot;verified&quot;, but not necessarily efficiently &quot;found&quot;. In contrast, the class FP, which can be thought of as the function class analogue of P, consists of function problems whose solutions can be found in polynomial time.

== Self-reducibility ==
Observe that the problem FSAT introduced above can be solved using only polynomially many calls to a subroutine which decides the SAT problem: An algorithm can first ask whether the formula formula_12 is satisfiable. After that the algorithm can fix variable formula_29 to TRUE and ask again. If the resulting formula is still satisfiable the algorithm keeps formula_29 fixed to TRUE and continues to fix formula_31, otherwise it decides that formula_29 has to be FALSE and continues. Thus, FSAT is solvable in polynomial time using an oracle deciding SAT. In general, a problem in NP is called &quot;self-reducible&quot; if its function variant can be solved in polynomial time using an oracle deciding the original problem. Every NP-complete problem is self-reducible. It is conjectured that the integer factorization problem is not self-reducible, because deciding whether an integer is prime is in P (easy), while the integer factorization problem is believed to be hard for a classical computer.
There are several (slightly different) notions of self-reducibility.

== Reductions and complete problems ==
Function problems can be reduced much like decision problems: Given function problems formula_33 and formula_34 we say that formula_33 reduces to formula_34 if there exists polynomially-time computable functions formula_37 and formula_38 such that for all instances formula_6 of formula_2 and possible solutions formula_7 of formula_42, it holds that

*If formula_6 has an formula_2-solution, then formula_45 has an formula_42-solution.
*formula_47

It is therefore possible to define FNP-complete problems analogous to the NP-complete problem:

A problem formula_33 is FNP-complete if every problem in FNP can be reduced to formula_33. The complexity class of FNP-complete problems is denoted by FNP-C or FNPC. Hence the problem FSAT is also an FNP-complete problem, and it holds that formula_50 if and only if formula_51.

== Total function problems ==
The relation formula_52 used to define function problems has the drawback of being incomplete: Not every input formula_6 has a counterpart formula_7 such that formula_8. Therefore the question of computability of proofs is not separated from the question of their existence. To overcome this problem it is convenient to consider the restriction of function problems to total relations yielding the class TFNP as a subclass of FNP. This class contains problems such as the computation of pure Nash equilibria in certain strategic games where a solution is guaranteed to exist. In addition, if TFNP contains any FNP-complete problem it follows that formula_56.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class FP is the set of function problems that can be solved by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. It is the function problem version of the decision problem class [[P (complexity)|P]]. Roughly speaking, it is the class of functions that can be efficiently computed on classical computers without randomization.

The difference between FP and P is that problems in P have one-bit, yes/no answers, while problems in FP can have any output that can be computed in polynomial time. For example, adding two numbers is an FP problem, while determining if their sum is odd is in P.

Polynomial-time function problems are fundamental in defining polynomial-time reductions, which are used in turn to define the class of NP-complete problems.

==Formal definition==
FP is formally defined as follows:

:A binary relation formula_1 is in FP if and only if there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given formula_2, either finds some formula_3 such that formula_1 holds, or signals that no such formula_3 exists.

==Related complexity classes==

* FNP is the set of binary relations for which there is a polynomial time algorithm that, given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, checks whether P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds. Just as P and FP are closely related, NP is closely related to FNP. FP = FNP if and only if P = NP. 
* Because a machine that uses logarithmic space has at most polynomially many configurations, FL, the set of function problems which can be calculated in logspace, is contained in FP. It is not known whether FL = FP; this is analogous to the problem of determining whether the decision classes P and L are equal.

<text>In computational complexity theory, the complexity class FNP is the function problem extension of the decision problem class NP. The name is somewhat of a misnomer, since technically it is a class of binary relations, not functions, as the following formal definition explains:

:A binary relation P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;), where &quot;y&quot; is at most polynomially longer than &quot;x&quot;, is in FNP if and only if there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that can determine whether P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds given both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;.

This definition does not involve nondeterminism and is analogous to the verifier definition of NP. 

There is an NP language directly corresponding to every FNP relation, sometimes called the decision problem &quot;induced by&quot; or &quot;corresponding to&quot; said FNP relation. It is the language formed by taking all the &quot;x&quot; for which P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds given some &quot;y&quot;; however, there may be more than one FNP relation for a particular decision problem.

Many problems in NP, including many NP-complete problems, ask whether a particular object exists, such as a satisfying assignment, a graph coloring, or a clique of a certain size. These problems often correspond to problems in FNP that ask not only whether an object exists but what value or values such an object can have. When a FNP problem corresponds in this way to an NP-complete problem, it is NP-hard. Bellare and Goldwasser showed in 1994 using some standard assumptions that there exist problems in NP such that their FNP versions are not self-reducible, implying that they are harder than their corresponding decision problem.

For each P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) in FNP, the search problem associated with P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) is: given &quot;x&quot;, find a &quot;y&quot; such that P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds, or state that no such &quot;y&quot; exists. The search problem for every relation in FNP can be solved in polynomial time if and only if P = NP. This result is usually stated as &quot;FP = FNP if and only if P = NP&quot;; however, for this statement to be true, it is necessary to redefine FP and FNP so that the members of FP and FNP are not relations, but are instead search problems associated with relations.

== Reductions ==
Let &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2 be two problems in FNP, with associated verification algorithms &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2. A reduction &quot;P&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;2 is defined as two efficiently-computable functions, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, such that

* &quot;f&quot; maps inputs &quot;x&quot; to &quot;P&quot;1 to inputs &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) to &quot;P&quot;2 ;
* &quot;g&quot; maps outputs &quot;y&quot; to &quot;P&quot;2 to outputs &quot;g&quot;(y) to &quot;P&quot;1 ;
* For all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;: if &quot;A&quot;2(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;),&quot;y&quot;) returns true, then &quot;A&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;, g(&quot;y&quot;)) returns true;
* For all &quot;x&quot;: if &quot;A&quot;2(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;),&quot;y&quot;) returns false for all &quot;y&quot;, then &quot;A&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;, g(&quot;y&quot;)) returns false for all &quot;y&quot;.

== Related complexity classes ==
* FP is the set of binary relations for which there is a polynomial time algorithm that, given &quot;x&quot;, finds some &quot;y&quot; for which P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds. The relation between FNP and FP is analogous to the relation between NP and P.
*TFNP is a subset of FNP: it contains those relations in FNP for which, for every &quot;x&quot;, there exists at least one &quot;y&quot; for which P(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) holds.

<doc id="663353" wikidata="Q3337686" url="?curid=663353" title="Ned Leeds">
<text>Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Leeds is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. A supporting character in stories featuring the superhero Spider-Man, he has been a reporter for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, and husband of Betty Brant. Leeds is one of the characters that appears under the mantle of the supervillain Hobgoblin; for a long time believed to be the first Hobgoblin, ten years following his assassination, he is retroactively established to have been the second Hobgoblin, brainwashed to serve as a stand-in for Roderick Kingsley and later left to be killed when he was no longer deemed necessary. The character was revived in a 2018–2022 storyline, with both Ned and Roderick brainwashed again by the Queen Goblin to serve as Hobgoblins. Synergetic with his MCU adaptation, Ned is revealed to be a sorcerer who trained with Baron Mordo to learn chaos magic, rewriting reality in an attempt to make himself the one-and-only Hobgoblin, archenemy of Spider-Man and lover of Natasha Romanoff.

Jacob Batalon portrays Ned Leeds in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), appearing in &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (both 2019), and &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (both 2021).

==Publication history==
Created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Ned Leeds made his first appearance in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #18 (November 1964). His character is killed off in the one-shot &quot;Spider-Man vs. Wolverine&quot; (February 1987), written by then Spider-Man editor Jim Owsley. Tom DeFalco, Ron Frenz, and Peter David (of the creative teams on the ongoing Spider-Man books) found this objectionable, saying that Owsley gave them no warning that he was going to kill Leeds, then a regular cast member in the Spider-Man books. Frenz remarked:

Leeds was revealed to be the Hobgoblin in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #289.

==Fictional character biography==
Ned Leeds was a reporter for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. He and Peter Parker compete for the affections of &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; secretary Betty Brant, but Parker drops out of the running due to realizing that Brant will not be able to accept Spider-Man&#x27;s double identity. He would win outright when Betty went into stress induced shock after J. Jonah Jameson was attacked at the Daily Bugle by the Scorpion. Leeds and Brant are married shortly after. However, the couple&#x27;s marriage is often strained, eventually becoming abusive.

When Spider-Man battles the Hobgoblin, Ned follows the Hobgoblin to a hideout. When the Hobgoblin realizes Ned is present, Ned is captured and brainwashed as a scapegoat in case of being unmasked. Wanting to find out about the Kingpin, Ned approaches Richard Fisk. Discovering that Richard hates the Kingpin, Leeds helps create Richard&#x27;s secret identity as the Rose. The Hobgoblin manipulates Ned to remove the Kingpin from the scene. Ned&#x27;s regular brainwashing causes his marriage with Betty and professional relationships to fall apart. Increasingly mentally unstable, Ned drives Betty to seek solace in Flash Thompson. While Flash makes statements about the Hobgoblin and events are staged so Flash is revealed as the enigmatic villain, Ned and Richard reach a disagreement and Ned decides to turn in the Rose to the Kingpin, and thus Ned is no longer needed as Hobgoblin. After Flash is cleared of being framed, the New York underworld empire is known that Ned is actually Hobgoblin and that he would soon be traveling to Berlin. Ned and Peter go on an assignment in Berlin, and Leeds is murdered by the Foreigner at Jason Macendale&#x27;s request as a replacement Hobgoblin. The Kingpin presents photos of Ned in the Hobgoblin costume (which was obtained via the Foreigner) to Spider-Man in an attempt to get Spider-Man to go after the Foreigner. Peter reflected on Ned&#x27;s death years later, believing Ned must have been framed as Hobgoblin as the Foreigner&#x27;s non-superhuman operatives would never have been able to defeat the real Hobgoblin. Around this time, the original Hobgoblin returns to eliminate Macendale, revealing the deception of Leeds being a stand-in. Spider-Man and Betty subsequently provoked Roderick Kingsley into confessing to Ned&#x27;s framing on tape.

During the &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot; storyline, a clone of Ned Leeds is created by Ben Reilly (posing as Jackal) and is seen in New U Technologies&#x27; facility Haven. The clone is revealed to have survived the end of the event and disguised himself as a hobo to continue watching over Betty. It is shown that Betty still cares for Ned. While still unaware of his survival, Ned feels that he is proud of Betty&#x27;s accomplishments. The clone later dies during a conflict between Spider-Man, Rhino, Taskmaster and Black Ant and tries to warn Spider-Man of something after Betty in the near future, revealed to be the real Ned Leeds, apparently revived.

In &quot;Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality&quot;, set before Ned&#x27;s death, Ned is revealed to have become the sorcerer apprentice of Baron Mordo while serving as the Hobgoblin, training under him in the art of reality-altering chaos magic. On assisting Mordo in reshaping reality to make Mordo Sorcerer Supreme, Ned also makes himself Spider-Man&#x27;s main archenemy, before luring the wall-crawler to the Sanctum Sanctorum to do battle with him, killing his Aunt May in front of Peter&#x27;s newly resurrected uncle. Swearing revenge, Peter retreats into his own body, with Venom taking over his functions to train for years in a pocket dimension with Doctor Strange to defeat Ned, beating the Hobgoblin to a pulp as his girlfriend the Red Cat flees, before travelling into the realm of Nightmare to return reality to its normal state, with both Peter and Ned losing their memories of the &quot;alien reality&quot; as a result.

By the time Spider-Man meets Kindred in person during the &quot;Last Remains&quot; arc, he finds that Kindred had dug up the bodies of Ned Leeds, Ben Parker, George Stacy, Gwen Stacy, Jean DeWolff, and Marla Jameson and sat them around a dinner table.

In spite of this, Ned is revealed to have been alive all along, his body having resurrected immediately following his assassination due to him having ingested Norman Osborn&#x27;s Goblin Formula beforehand. After spending years in hiding, stalking Betty, he reveals himself to her and convinces her to let him back into her life, getting back together with her and eventually even have a child together. In &quot;The Hobgoblins&#x27; Last Stand&quot;, both Ned and Kingsley are both turned into Hobgoblins again by the Queen Goblin, serving as her enforcers.

Ned Leeds had a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism, and was a master of deductive reasoning and investigation. He was a normal man who engaged in regular exercise, which increased to more intensive levels after assuming the Hobgoblin role. As the Hobgoblin, Ned wore his signature uniform and used the glider and equipment which included Jack O&#x27;Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength, prior to ingesting the Goblin Formula, after which he developed superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low-level rapid healing factor, the latter of which allow him to survive otherwise fatal gunshot wounds.

** In &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), Leeds becomes romantically involved with classmate Betty Brant despite his initial claims of being a single bachelor throughout a school field trip to Europe while supporting Parker&#x27;s feelings for MJ. Following the end of the trip however, Leeds and Brant mutually break up and remain friends.
** In &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, Leeds, Parker, and MJ have trouble applying to colleges after Mysterio publicly exposes Parker&#x27;s identity. Parker seeks help from Doctor Strange for help in making everyone forget. However, Strange&#x27;s spell backfires and pulls in supervillains who fought Spider-Man from across the multiverse. Strange tasks Parker, Leeds, and MJ with capturing the villains, but Parker traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension in an attempt to reform the villains. While using Strange&#x27;s Sling Ring to find Parker, Leeds and MJ encounter two alternate universe versions of Parker that they nickname &quot;Peter-Two&quot; and &quot;Peter-Three&quot;. Once the three Spider-Men defeat and cure the villains, Strange returns the displaced individuals to their respective home universes before Parker asks him to erase all memory of the latter from everyone in their universe, resulting in Leeds forgetting his friendship with Parker and Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity.
* An alternate universe incarnation of Ned Leeds from Earth-65 makes a minor non-speaking appearance in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot; (2023) as one of Peter Parker&#x27;s bullies.

<doc id="663355" wikidata="Q27919" url="?curid=663355" title="Lava tube">
<text>A lava tube, more rarely called a pyroduct, is a &#x27;roofed conduit through which molten lava travels away from its vent&#x27;. If lava in the tube drains out, it will leave an empty cave. Lava tubes are common in low-viscosity volcanic systems. Lava tubes are important as they are able to transport molten lava much further away from the eruptive vent than lava channels. A tube-forming lava flow can emplace on longer distance due to the presence of a solid crust protecting the molten lava from atmospheric cooling. Lava tubes are often considered when preparing hazard maps or managing an eruptive crisis.

== Formation ==
A lava tube is a type of lava cave formed when a low-viscosity lava flow develops a continuous and hard crust, which thickens and forms a roof above the still-flowing lava stream. Three main formation mechanisms have been described: (1) roofing over a lava channel, (2) pāhoehoe lobe extension or (3) lava flow inflation.

# When it erupts from a vent, lava usually flows in channels. While the core of the channel tends to stay very hot, its sides cool down rapidly, forming solidified walls called levees. Depending on the activity of the channel, three ways to form a lava tube are possible. If the level of lava flowing inside the channel is stable for a long time, the surface will start to solidify from the levees toward the center of the channel, slowly forming a solid crust. If the level of lava is irregular, the overspill of lava along the levees causes them to grow and eventually join together over the channel. Another way these channels may close is by the accumulation of floating surface crust. This type of lava tube tends to form closer to the eruptive vent.
# When pahoehoe lava emplaces, it sometimes form lobes. The formation of aligned pahoehoe lobes that are continuously fed by molten lava may form lava tubes.
# During an eruption, when lava flows emplace and their sides cool rapidly and solidify into levees, the pressure of molten lava passing through the flow may cause it to inflate. The surface of the flow then solidifies as it cools, forming a crust, leading to the formation of a lava tube.

== Characteristics ==
A broad lava-flow field often forms a lava tube system that consists of a main lava tube and a series of smaller tubes that supply lava to the front of one or more separate flows. When the supply of lava stops at the end of an eruption, or lava is diverted elsewhere, lava in the tube system sometimes drains downslope and leaves partially or fully empty caves.

Such drained tubes commonly exhibit numerous internal features that can give information on the activity that happened within the tube. Wall linings are thin layers of lava that cover the walls and ceiling of a tube. They form when the tube drains. Each wall lining corresponds to a cycle of drainage and refilling of the tube. Step marks on the walls indicate the various depths at which the lava flowed. These are known as lava benches, flow ledges or flow lines, depending on how prominently they protrude from the walls. Lava tubes generally have pāhoehoe floors, although this may often be covered in breakdown from the ceiling. A variety of stalactite, generally known as lavacicles, can be observed inside lava tubes. They can be of the splash, &quot;shark tooth&quot;, or tubular varieties. Lavacicles are the most common lava tube internal feature. Drip stalagmites may form under tubular lava stalactites, and the latter may grade into a form known as a tubular lava helictite. A runner is a bead of lava that is extruded from a small opening and then runs down a wall. 

Lava tubes may also contain mineral deposits that most commonly take the form of crusts or small crystals, and less commonly, as stalactites and stalagmites. Some stalagmites may contain a central conduit and are interpreted as hornitos extruded from the tube floor.

Lava tubes can be up to wide, though are often narrower, and run anywhere from below the surface. Lava tubes can also be extremely long; one tube from the Mauna Loa 1859 flow enters the ocean about from its eruption point, and the Cueva del Viento–Sobrado system on Teide, Tenerife island, is over long, due to extensive braided maze areas at the upper zones of the system.

A lava tube system in Kiama, Australia, consists of over 20 tubes, many of which are breakouts of a main lava tube. The largest of these lava tubes is in diameter and has columnar jointing due to the large cooling surface. Other tubes have concentric and jointing features. These tubes are infilled due to the low slope angle of emplacement.

== Extraterrestrial lava tubes ==
Lunar lava tubes have been discovered and have been studied as possible human habitats, providing natural shielding from radiation. Several holes on the lunar surface, including one in the Marius Hills region, have been observed with angled satellite imagery to lead into voids wider than the holes themselves. These are considered as possible collapses into lunar lava tubes.

Martian lava tubes are associated with innumerable lava flows and lava channels on the flanks of Olympus Mons. Partially collapsed lava tubes are visible as chains of pit craters, and broad lava fans formed by lava emerging from intact, subsurface tubes are also common. Evidence of Martian lava tubes has also been observed on the Southeast Tharsis region and Alba Mons.

Caves, including lava tubes, are considered candidate biotopes of interest for extraterrestrial life.

== Notable examples ==
* Iceland
** Surtshellir – For a long time, this was the longest known lava tube in the world.
* Italy
** Grotta dei Tre Livelli - Famous example of a multiple level lava tube.
* Kenya
** Leviathan Cave – At , it is the longest lava tube in Africa.
* South Korea
** Manjang Cave – more than long, located in Jeju Island, is a popular tourism spot.
* United States
** Kazumura Cave, Hawaii – The world&#x27;s most extensive lava tube, at , it has the greatest linear extent of any known lava cave.

<doc id="663358" wikidata="Q1563536" url="?curid=663358" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv">
<text>The Diocese of Sofia and Plovdiv () is a Latin diocese of the Catholic Church which includes the whole southern part of Bulgaria. The remainder of Bulgaria falls within the Diocese of Nicopoli. The diocese is exempt, i.e. immediately subject of the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province.
The seat of the episcopal see is the Cathedral of St Louis is in Plovdiv and there is a new co-cathedral in Sofia — the Cathedral of St. Joseph, consecrated on May 21, 2006 by Cardinal Angelo Sodano. The construction was symbolically started by Pope John Paul II during his visit in Sofia in 2002.

== History ==
The former name of the city, and of the previous diocese (now Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria) was Serdica, the city of the Serdi, a Celtic people defeated by Crassus in 29 BC and subjected to the Kingdom of Thrace, then a vassal state of republican Rome. When this kingdom was suppressed in 49 BC, the Serdi were included in the Roman Province of Thracia. Roman Emperor Trajan transformed the borough of the Serdi into a city which he called Ulpia Serdica. In 275 Aurelian caused Dacia beyond the Danube to be evacuated, and transplanted to Moesia and Roman Thracia the soldiers and colonists who were faithful to the Roman cause. The country occupied by these immigrants formed the new Province of Dacia, Sardica being included in this province (Homo, &quot;Essai sur le règne de l&#x27;empereur Aurélien&quot;, pp. 313–21).
Later, Diocletian divided Dacia into Dacia Ripensis and Dacia Mediterranea. Sardica was the civil and ecclesiastical metropolis of the latter. Gallienus established a mint at Sardica, and Constantine the Great, who was born in the region, contemplated making it his capital. The Edict of Serdica ending the Diocletian persecution was signed into law here.

Ecclesiastically, Sardica belonged to the Patriarchate of Rome until 733, when it was annexed to the Patriarchate of Constantinople until 809. Upon the conversion of the Bulgarians to Christianity in 865, Sardica was one of the first cities which had an episcopal see. Until 1204 it was included in the Graeco-Bulgarian Patriarchate of Achrida, until 1393 in the Bulgarian Patriarchate of Tirnovo and until 1872 again in the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Since then Sardica, which is now called Sophia, belongs to the Orthodox national Church of Bulgaria.

The earliest known bishop is Protagenes, who assisted at the First Council of Nicaea in 325; the best known is Bonosus, who shortly afterwards attacked the virginity of the Blessed Virgin.

Julian of Sardica who was metropolitan of Dacia Meditteranea attended the Council of Ephesus, in 431.

When it was captured by the Bulgars, they changed its name to Sredetz, later transformed by the Greeks into Sraditza and Triaditza. Again occupied by the &#x27;Greek&#x27; Byzantines from 1018 to 1186, it enjoyed great prosperity; a section of the population was Paulician or Manichaean, heresies from both Catholic and (later) Orthodox points of view. After some years of troubles it again fell into the power of the Bulgars. Its present name of Sophia dates from the Middle Ages, though the precise date of its first use cannot be assigned; in the sixteenth century Sredetz and Sophia were used simultaneously. In 1382 the city was captured by the Ottoman Turks, and for more than four centuries it was the residence of the beglerbeg (governor general) of all Rumelia. In 1878 Sophia was chosen as the capital of the tributary Principality of Bulgaria, and since 1908 became the capital of the Kingdom of Bulgaria, later of the present republic.

==Council of Sardica==

The Council of Sardica was summoned as an Ecumenical Council in 342, 343, or 347 in response to the Arian Heresy. Emperors Constans and Constantius, the two remaining sons of Constantine worked together at the urging of Pope Julius in response to this heresy that not only divided the church, but the state as well. Constans, Augustus in Rome, favored the Nicene bishops while Constantius, Augustus in Constantinople, often supported Arian ones. To help insure equal representation to solve this divisive issue, Sardica (now Sofia in Bulgaria) was chosen as a location near the division between eastern and western portions of the Roman State. However, fearing domination of the council by Western bishops, many Eastern bishops left the council to hold another council in Philippopolis. As a result, the Council of Sardica failed to universally represent the church and is not one of the official Ecumenical Councils.

Sardica produced 21 canon. In addition to the attempt to resolve the Arian issue, other major points were:
#Bishops should not attempt to recruit from diocese other than their own
#Bishops should be permanent residents of their own diocese
#Bishops should spend most of their time in their own diocese (not at the court in Rome)
#Bishops should not be transferred to another diocese

== Modern Catholic jurisdiction in Sofia ==
An Apostolic vicariate (missionary pre-diocesan jurisdiction, entitled to a titular bishop) was created here at an early date and confided to the Franciscans.
In 1610 Rome reestablished – but now as a suffragan bishopric – the episcopal see of Sophia, which in 1643 was made archiepiscopal again.
It was suppressed towards the end of the eighteenth century, because the Catholics felt persecuted by the Turks and had emigrated, mostly to imperial Austria-Hungary and Russia, yet in 1758 restored, now as Apostolic Vicariate of Sofia–Plovdiv . Relative peace was restored in 1835, and Rome confided the direction of the Catholics to the Redemptorists, under a vicar Apostolic who had not received episcopal consecration. The Redemptorists were replaced by the Capuchins in 1841, their superior being consecrated bishop in 1848.

In the early 20th century a titular bishop (of various other sees) was the head of this vicariate Apostolic. Sophia had 105,000 inhabitants, of whom a small number are Catholics. The Christian Brothers had a school there, and the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition three convents.

<text>This is a list of [[complexity class]]es in computational complexity theory. For other computational and complexity subjects, see list of computability and complexity topics.

Many of these classes have a &#x27;co&#x27; partner which consists of the complements of all languages in the original class. For example, if a language L is in NP then the complement of L is in co-NP. (This does not mean that the complement of NP is co-NP—there are languages which are known to be in both, and other languages which are known to be in neither.)

&quot;The hardest problems&quot; of a class refer to problems which belong to the class such that every other problem of that class can be reduced to it.

<text>Theophilus Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor (July 11, 1897 – March 10, 1973) was an American politician who served as Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of Birmingham, Alabama, for more than two decades. A lifelong member of the Democratic Party, he strongly opposed the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Under the city commission government, Connor had responsibility for administrative oversight of the Birmingham Fire Department and the Birmingham Police Department, which also had their own chiefs.

As a white supremacist, Bull Connor enforced legal racial segregation and denied civil rights to black citizens, especially during 1963&#x27;s Birmingham campaign led by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. He is well known for directing the use of fire hoses and police attack dogs against civil rights activists, including against children supporting the protests. National media broadcast these tactics on television, horrifying much of the world. The outrages served as catalysts for major social and legal change in the Southern United States and contributed to passage by the United States Congress of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

==Early life==
Connor was born in 1897 in Selma, Alabama, the son of Molly (Godwin) and Hugh King Connor, a train dispatcher and telegraph operator.

== Career ==
He entered politics as a Democrat in 1934 winning a seat in the Alabama House of Representatives and maintained that party affiliation throughout his career. As a legislator, he voted for extending the poll tax, which served as a barrier to voter registration by poor blacks and whites, and against an anti-sedition bill intended to stifle union activity. He did not stand for a second term in 1936, instead running for Commissioner of Public Safety for the City of Birmingham. Concurrently during this period, Connor served as the radio play-by-play broadcaster of the minor league Birmingham Barons baseball club spanning the 1932 through 1936 seasons. Willie Mays remembered listening to him call games: &quot;Pretty good announcer, too, although I think he used to get too excited.&quot;

===Commissioner of Public Safety (1936–1954, 1957–1963)===
In 1936, Connor was elected to the office of commissioner of Public Safety of Birmingham, beginning the first of two stretches that spanned a total of 26 years. His first stretch ended in 1952, but he was re-elected in 1956, serving to 1963.

In 1938, Connor ran as a candidate for Governor of Alabama. He announced he would be campaigning on a platform of &quot;protecting employment practices, law enforcement, segregation and other problems that have been historically classified as states&#x27; rights by the Democratic party&quot;.

In 1948, Connor&#x27;s officers arrested the U.S. Senator from Idaho, Glen H. Taylor. He was the running mate of Progressive Party presidential candidate Henry Wallace, former Democratic vice president. Taylor, who had attempted to speak to the Southern Negro Youth Congress, was arrested for violating Birmingham&#x27;s racial segregation laws. Connor&#x27;s effort to enforce the law was caused by the group&#x27;s reported communist philosophy, with Connor noting at the time, &quot;There&#x27;s not enough room in town for Bull and the Commies.&quot;

During the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Connor led the Alabama delegation in a walkout when the national party included a civil rights plank in its platform. The offshoot States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party (Dixiecrats) nominated Strom Thurmond for president at its convention in Birmingham&#x27;s Municipal Auditorium.

Connor&#x27;s second run for governor failed in 1954. He was the center of controversy that year by pushing through a city ordinance in Birmingham that outlawed &quot;communism.&quot;

===Civil rights era===
Before returning to office in 1956, Connor quickly resumed his brutal approach to dealing with perceived threats to the social order. His forces raided a meeting which was being held at the house of African-American activist Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, where three Montgomery ministers were in attendance. He feared that the Montgomery bus boycott which was under way would spread to Birmingham, in an effort to integrate city buses. He had the ministers arrested on charges of vagrancy, which meant that they were not allowed to pay bail, nor were they allowed to receive any visitors during the first three days of their incarceration. A federal investigation followed, but Connor refused to cooperate.

In 1960, Connor was elected Democratic National Committeeman for Alabama, soon after filing a civil lawsuit against &quot;The New York Times&quot; for $1.5 million. He objected to what he claimed was their insinuation that he had promoted racial hatred. He dropped his claim for damages to $400,000; the case dragged on for six years until Connor lost a $40,000 judgment on appeal.

===Freedom Riders===

In the spring of 1961, integrated teams of civil rights activists mounted what they called &quot;Freedom Rides&quot; to highlight the illegal imposition of racial segregation on interstate buses, whose operations came under federal law and the constitution. They had teams ride Greyhound and Trailways buses traveling through southern capitals, with the final stop intended as New Orleans. The teams encountered increasing hostility and violence as they made their way deeper into the South.

On May 2, 1961, Connor had won a landslide election for his sixth term as Commissioner of Public Safety in Birmingham. As Commissioner, he had administrative authority over the police and fire departments, schools, public health service, and libraries, all of which were segregated by state law. Tom King, a candidate running for mayor of Birmingham, met with Connor on May 8, 1961, to pay his respects. In addition, he asked him to refrain from announcing support for the other leading mayoral candidate, Art Hanes, so that King&#x27;s chances would be greater. At the end of the meeting, Connor noted that he was expecting the Freedom Riders to reach Birmingham the following Sunday, Mother&#x27;s Day. He stated, &quot;We&#x27;ll be ready for them, too,&quot; and King responded, &quot;I bet you will, Commissioner,&quot; as he walked out.

After a stop in Anniston, Alabama, the Greyhound bus of the Freedom Riders was attacked. They were offered no police protection. After they left town, they were forced to stop by a violent mob that firebombed and burned the bus, but no activists were fatally hurt. A new Greyhound bus was placed into service and departed for Birmingham. The activists on the earlier Trailways bus had been accosted by Ku Klux Klan members who boarded the bus in Atlanta and beat up the activists, pushing them all to the back of the bus.

The Freedom Riders arrived in Birmingham on May 14, 1961. As the Trailways bus reached the terminal in Birmingham, a large mob of Klansmen and news reporters was waiting for them. The Riders were viciously attacked soon after they disembarked from the bus and attempted to gain service at the whites-only lunch counter. Some were taken to the loading dock area, away from reporters, but some reporters were also beaten with metal bars, pipes, and bats and one&#x27;s camera was destroyed. After 15 minutes, the police finally arrived, but by then most Klansmen had left.

Connor intentionally let the Klansmen beat the Riders for 15 minutes with no police intervention. He publicly blamed the violence on many factors, saying that &quot;No policemen were in sight as the buses arrived, because they were visiting their mothers on Mother&#x27;s Day&quot;. He insisted that the violence came from out-of-town meddlers and that police had rushed to the scene &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot; The violence was covered by national media.

He said: 
As I have said on numerous occasions, we are not going to stand for this in Birmingham. And if necessary we will fill the jail full and we don&#x27;t care whose toes we step on. I am saying now to these meddlers from out of our city the best thing for them to do is stay out if they don&#x27;t want to get slapped in jail. Our people of Birmingham are a peaceful people and we never have any trouble here unless some people come into our city looking for trouble. And I&#x27;ve never seen anyone yet look for trouble who wasn&#x27;t able to find it.

In 1962, Connor ordered the closing of 60 Birmingham parks rather than follow a federal court order to desegregate public facilities.

In November 1962, in response to the extremely negative perception of the city—it was derisively nicknamed &quot;Bombingham&quot; by outsiders for the numerous attacks on the homes and churches of black civil rights activists—Birmingham voters changed the city&#x27;s form of government. Rather than an at-large election of three commissioners, who had specific oversight of certain city departments, there would be a mayor-council form of government. Members of the city council were to be elected from nine single-member districts. Blacks were still largely disenfranchised. For instance, in 1961 when the president of the city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce was visiting Japan, he saw a newspaper photo of a bus engulfed in flames, which occurred during the Freedom Rides. Bull Connor had arranged for opponents to have time to attack civil rights activists when their bus reached Birmingham.

Endorsed by Governor George C. Wallace, Connor attempted to run for mayor, but lost on April 2, 1963. Connor and his fellow commissioners filed suit to block the change in power, but on May 23, 1963, the Supreme Court of Alabama ruled against them. Connor ended his 23-year tenure in the post. Citing a general law, he had argued that the change could not take effect until the October 1 following the date of the election, but the Supreme Court of Alabama held that the general law was preempted by a special law applicable to only the City of Birmingham.

===Birmingham campaign===
Local civil rights activists had been unable to negotiate much change with the city or business leaders, in their efforts to gain integration of facilities and hiring of blacks by local businesses. They invited Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his team to help mount a more concerted campaign. The day after the April election, Dr. King and local civil rights leaders began &quot;Project &#x27;C&#x27;&quot; (for &quot;confrontation&quot;) against the Birmingham business community. They used economic boycotts and demonstrations to seek integration of stores and job opportunities. Throughout April 1963, King led smaller demonstrations, which resulted in his arrest along with many others.

King wanted to have massive arrests to highlight the brutal police tactics used by Connor and his subordinates. (By extension, the campaign was intended to demonstrate the general suppression by other Southern police officials as well). After King was arrested and jailed, he wrote his &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail,&quot; which became noted as a moral argument for civil rights activism. The goal of the campaign was to gain mass arrests of non-violent protesters and overwhelm the judicial and penal systems. It would also demonstrate to national media and local residents the strong desire of African Americans to exercise their constitutional rights as citizens.

===Children&#x27;s Crusade===
In the final phase of Project C, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference&#x27;s James Bevel introduced a controversial new tactic of using young people in the demonstrations. Most adults were working for bosses who openly threatened their jobs with termination for participating in the demonstrations. On May 2, 1963, the first youths and students walked out of the 16th Street Baptist Church and attempted to march to Birmingham&#x27;s City Hall to talk to the Mayor. By the end of the day, 959 children, ranging from ages 6–18, had been arrested.

The next day, even more students joined the marches, against whom Connor ordered the use of fire hoses and attack dogs. This did not stop the demonstrators, but generated bad publicity for Connor through the news media. The use of fire hoses continued and by May 7, Connor and the police department had detained more than 3,000 demonstrators.

The Black Americans&#x27; economic boycott of businesses that refused to hire them and downtown stores that kept segregated facilities helped gain negotiation by the city&#x27;s business leaders. The SCLC and the Senior Citizens Committee, who represented a majority of Birmingham businesses, came to an agreement. On May 10, they agreed on desegregation of lunch counters, restrooms, fitting rooms, and drinking fountains at department stores, the upgrading in position and hiring of blacks, cooperation with SCLC legal representatives in releasing all detainees, and the establishment of formal communication between black and whites through the Senior Citizens Committee.

== Later life and death ==
On June 3, 1964, Connor resumed a place in government when he was elected president of the Alabama Public Service Commission. He suffered a stroke on December 7, 1966, and used a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Connor won another term in 1968, but was defeated in 1972.

He suffered another stroke on February 26, 1973, which left him unconscious. He died a few weeks later, in March of that year. Survivors included his widow, Beara, a daughter, and a brother, Ed Connor.

==Legacy==
Connor&#x27;s brutality and violence against civil rights activists contributed to Ku Klux Klan and other violence against black people in the city of Birmingham. On a Sunday in September 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing destroyed a portion of the church basement causing the death of four Black girls, Addie Mae Collins age 14, Carol Denise McNair age 11, Carole Rosamond Robertson age 14, and Cynthia Dionne Wesley, age 14. The church was known as the center of civil rights activities in Birmingham. The city and movement leaders had just reached a negotiated agreement on integration of facilities and jobs. The deaths of the children prompted the Attorney General Robert Kennedy to call Governor George Wallace and threaten to send in federal troops to control violence and bombings in Birmingham.

== In popular culture ==
*Connor is mentioned in contemporary folk singer Phil Ochs&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;Talking Birmingham Jam&quot;.
*Connor is played by Kenneth McMillan in the 1978 television miniseries &quot;King&quot;.
*Spike Lee&#x27;s 1997 documentary &quot;4 Little Girls&quot;, which is about the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing, includes footage of Connor and interviews with people describing police tactics during his tenure.
*Footage of Connor appears in the 1999 film &quot;Our Friend, Martin,&quot; in which he is voiced by veteran voice artist Frank Welker.
*Connor is cited by name in the 2014 film &quot;Selma&quot; as an example of a particular type of bullying public official and police officer whose tolerance, or encouragement, of violence towards Civil Rights campaigners plays into the hands of the media-conscious SCLC and Martin Luther King Jr.
*Connor is referenced in the syndicated comic strip &quot;The Boondocks&quot;, where Huey Freeman mistakes a man washing his car for Connor. Connor also appears as an antagonist in the 2014 episode &quot;Freedom Ride or Die&quot; in the animated TV series based on the strip.
*Connor is framed as an antagonist in John Lewis&#x27;s graphic novel memoir series &quot;March&quot;, appearing in the 2015 second novel of the trilogy as an opposition to the Freedom Riders and general racial equality.
*In the 2004 remake of &quot;The Ladykillers&quot;, the character played by J. K. Simmons stands up to another character and says, &#x27;You don&#x27;t scare me, Bull Connor didn&#x27;t scare me.&#x27;

<text>Jakki Degg (born 20 February 1978) is an English glamour model and actress. While the bulk of her work has been done in England, she has appeared in American film and television, and has posed for posters and magazine pictorials.

==Early life==
Although born in Stone, Degg, daughter of David Degg, was raised in Hednesford, Staffordshire, England. Degg studied dance as a child, particularly ballet, and won several competitions. She went on to hairdressing school and managed a salon of her own by age 20.

==Career==
===Modelling===
Jakki became famous when, at her mother&#x27;s encouragement, she entered and won the inaugural &quot;Max Power&quot; magazine babes competition. Following this she became a Page 3 girl for &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. She has posed topless and semi-nude for lad mags such as &quot;Front&quot;.

===Acting===
She has appeared on television several times. She had a small role in the drama &quot;Is Harry on the Boat?&quot; (Sky One) and played the lead in the short film &quot;Remember My Dream&quot;, directed by Joao Costa Menezes. She was also a stand-in for the TV show &quot;The Games&quot; but was not used. She wielded a shotgun on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Banzai&quot; as viewers were encouraged to wager on how many balloons she would pop with it.

Degg won the Page 3 model charity special edition of BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, beating Leilani Dowding in the sudden death round, with her winnings going to the RSPCA. However, her appearance on the show&#x27;s 1,000th episode was short lived, as she was the first contestant eliminated on a countback. She was sent off after incorrectly answering the question: &quot;In the abbreviated names of fruit and veg often found in a greengrocers, pots is an abbreviation of which word?&quot;, to which Degg answered &quot;Pottery&quot;; the correct answer was potatoes.

In 2004 she won the &quot;Celebrity 24 Hour Quiz&quot; on ITV with her winnings also going to the RSPCA.

She also appeared in &quot;The Poker Academy&quot;, and the American film &quot;Eurotrip&quot;.

<doc id="663372" wikidata="Q647146" url="?curid=663372" title="Bucket elevator">
<text>A bucket elevator, also called a grain leg, is a mechanism for hauling flowable bulk materials (most often grain or fertilizer) vertically.

It consists of:
# Buckets to contain the material;
# A belt to carry the buckets and transmit the pull;
# Means to drive the belt;
# Accessories for loading the buckets or picking up the material, for receiving the discharged material, for maintaining the belt tension and for enclosing and protecting the elevator.

A bucket elevator can elevate a variety of bulk materials from light to heavy and from fine to large lumps.

A centrifugal discharge elevator may be vertical or inclined. Vertical elevators depend entirely on centrifugal force to get the material into the discharge chute, and so must be run at a relatively high speed. Inclined elevators with buckets spaced apart or set close together may have the discharge chute set partly under the head pulley. Since they do not depend entirely on centrifugal force to put the material into the chute, their speed may be slower.

Nearly all centrifugal discharge elevators have spaced buckets with rounded bottoms. They pick up their load from a boot, a pit, or a pile of material at the foot pulley.

The buckets can be also triangular in cross-section and set close together on the belt with little or no clearance between them. This is a continuous bucket elevator. Its main use is to carry difficult materials at a slow speed.

Early bucket elevators used a flat chain with small, steel buckets attached every few inches. While some elevators are still manufactured with a chain and steel buckets, most current bucket elevators use a rubber belt with plastic buckets. Pulleys several feet in diameter are used at the top and bottom. The top pulley is driven by an electric motor.

The bucket elevator is the enabling technology that permitted the construction of grain elevators. A diverter at the top of the elevator allows the grain to be sent to the chosen bin.

A similar device with flat steps is occasionally used as an elevator for humans, e.g. for employees in parking garages. (This sort of elevator is generally considered too dangerous for use by the public.)

==Bucket elevator styles==

There are three common bucket elevator designs seen in bulk material handling facilities worldwide:

* Centrifugal Discharge Elevator – This is the typical style of elevator used in many grain handling facilities. The elevator buckets discharge the grain freely, using centrifugal force. The grain is flung out of the bucket into the discharge spout at the top of the elevator. The most common style of agricultural elevator bucket is the &quot;CC&quot; style. This style can be recognized by the four breaks in the inside bottom of the bucket, straight sides, and the presence of high sides or &quot;ears&quot;.
* Continuous Discharge Elevator – This style of bucket elevator is used typically to discharge sluggish and non-free flowing materials; the elevator buckets discharge on top of each other. To achieve the required centrifugal force, a speed of around 6 metres (20 feet) per second is used. Common styles of elevator buckets used are the MF, HF, LF, and HFO due to their &quot;V&quot; style, among other attributes.
* Positive Discharge Elevator – Buckets are used to elevate delicate products such as popcorn, candy and potato chips (British: crisps), for which gentle handling is very important. This style elevator bucket operates off a double strand chain; the buckets are held in place by two pins so that they can swivel freely. To discharge the bucket, it is mechanically flipped, but until then the bucket is held parallel to the floor and upright. These elevators typically form an &quot;S&quot; or &quot;L&quot; in design and run throughout a plant.

<doc id="663389" wikidata="Q51564" url="?curid=663389" title="John Landis">
<text>John David Landis (born August 3, 1950) is an American filmmaker and actor. He is best known for directing comedy films such as &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; (1977), &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988) and &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; (1994), and horror films such as &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; (1981) and &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992). He also directed the music videos for Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (1983) and &quot;Black or White&quot; (1991). 

Landis later ventured into television work, including the series &quot;Dream On&quot; (1990), &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1994) and &quot;Sliders&quot; (1995). He also directed several episodes of the 2000s horror anthology series &quot;Masters of Horror&quot; and &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, as well as commercials for DirecTV, Taco Bell, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kellogg&#x27;s and Disney. In 2008, Landis won an Emmy Award for the documentary &quot;Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project&quot; (2007).

In 1982, Landis became the subject of controversy when three actors, including two children, died on set while filming his segment of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983). Landis, as well as several other parties, were subsequently tried and acquitted for involuntary manslaughter, but the incident had long-lasting effects on film industry practices.

Landis is the father of filmmaker Max Landis.

==Early life==
Landis was born into a Jewish American family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Shirley Levine (&quot;née&quot; Magaziner) and Marshall Landis, an interior designer and decorator. Landis and his parents relocated to Los Angeles when he was four months old. Though spending his childhood in California, Landis still refers to Chicago as his home town; he is a fan of the Chicago White Sox baseball team.

When Landis was a young boy, he watched &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot;, which inspired him to become a director:I had complete suspension of disbelief—really, I was eight years old and it transported me. I was on that beach running from that dragon, fighting that Cyclops. It just really dazzled me, and I bought it completely. And so, I actually sat through it twice and when I got home, I asked my mom, &quot;Who does that? Who makes the movie?&quot;

==Career==

===Early===
Landis began his film career working as a mailboy at 20th Century-Fox. He worked as a &quot;go-fer&quot; and then as an assistant director during filming Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; in Yugoslavia in 1969; he replaced the film&#x27;s original assistant director, who became ill and was sent home. During that time Landis became acquainted with actors Don Rickles and Donald Sutherland, both of whom would later work in his films. Following &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, Landis worked on several films that were shot in Europe (especially in Italy and the United Kingdom), including &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, &quot;El Condor&quot; and &quot;A Town Called Bastard&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;A Town Called Hell&quot;). Landis also worked as a stunt double.

Aged 21, Landis made his directorial debut with &quot;Schlock&quot;. The film, which he also wrote and appeared in, is a tribute to monster movies. The gorilla suit for the film was made by Rick Baker—the beginning of a long-term collaboration between Landis and Baker. Though completed in 1971, &quot;Schlock&quot; was not released until 1973 after it caught the attention of Johnny Carson. A fan of the film, Carson invited Landis on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and showed clips to help promote it. &quot;Schlock&quot; has since gained a cult following, but Landis has described the film as &quot;terrible&quot;.

Landis was hired by Eon Productions to write a screen treatment for &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, but his screenplay of James Bond foiling a kidnapping of the Pope in Latin America was rejected by Albert R. Broccoli for satirizing the Catholic Church. Landis was then hired to direct &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; after David Zucker saw his &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance. The film was inspired by the satirical sketch comedy of shows like &quot;Monty Python&quot;, &quot;Free the Army&quot;, &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. It is notable for being the first film written by the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker team, who would later have success with &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Naked Gun&quot; trilogy.

===1978–1981===
Sean Daniel, an assistant to Universal executive Thom Mount, saw &quot;The Kentucky Fried Movie&quot; and recommended Landis to direct &quot;Animal House&quot; based on that. Landis says of the screenplay, &quot;It was really literally one of the funniest things I ever read. It had a nasty edge like &quot;National Lampoon&quot;. I told him it was wonderful, extremely smart and funny, but everyone&#x27;s a pig for one thing.&quot; While &quot;Animal House&quot; received mixed reviews, it was a massive financial success, earning over $120 million at the domestic box office, making it the highest grossing comedy film of its time. Its success started the &quot;gross-out&quot; film genre, which became one of Hollywood&#x27;s staples. It also featured the screen debuts of John Belushi, Karen Allen and Kevin Bacon.

In 1980, Landis co-wrote and directed &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, a comedy starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. It featured musical numbers by R&amp;B and soul legends James Brown, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles and John Lee Hooker. It was, at the time, one of the most expensive films ever made, costing almost $30 million (for comparison, Steven Spielberg&#x27;s contemporary film &quot;1941&quot; cost $35 million). It is speculated that Spielberg and Landis engaged in a rivalry, the goal of which was to make the more expensive film. The rivalry might have been a friendly one, as Spielberg makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; (as the unnamed desk clerk near the end) and Landis had made a cameo in &quot;1941&quot; as a messenger.

In 1981, Landis wrote and directed another cult-status film, the comedy-horror &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;. It was perhaps Landis&#x27; most personal project; he had been planning to make it since 1969, while in Yugoslavia working on &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;. It was another commercial success for Landis and inspired studios to put comedic elements in their horror films.

===&quot;Twilight Zone&quot; deaths and legal action against Landis===

On July 23, 1982, during the filming of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, actor Vic Morrow and child actors Myca Dinh Le (age 7) and Renee Shin-Yi Chen (age 6) were killed in an accident involving an out-of-control helicopter. The three were caught under the aircraft when it crashed, and Morrow and one child were decapitated.

In June 1983, Landis, associate producer George Folsey Jr., production manager Dan Allingham, head of special effects Paul Stewart and helicopter pilot Dorcey Wingo were charged with involuntary manslaughter. In December, Morrow&#x27;s daughters Jennifer Jason Leigh and Carrie Morrow also sued Landis, Wingo, Warner Bros. Studios and others for negligence and wrongful death, resulting in Warner Bros. settling their case out of court, awarding $850,000 to each party. Following the accident, Spielberg ended his friendship with Landis.

In October 1984, the National Transportation Safety Board reported:

The lawsuit finally proceeded in 1985. Landis insisted that the deaths of Morrow, Le and Chen were the result of an accident. However, camera operators filming the scene testified to Landis being a very imperious director, and a &quot;yeller and screamer&quot; on set. During a take three hours before the incident, Wingo (a veteran of the Vietnam War) told Landis that the fireballs were too large and too close to the helicopter, to which Landis responded, &quot;You ain&#x27;t seen nothing yet.&quot; With special effects explosions blasting around them, the helicopter descended over Morrow, Le, and Chen. Witnesses testified that Landis was still shouting for the helicopter to fly &quot;Lower! Lower!&quot; moments before it crashed.

The prosecutors demonstrated that Landis was reckless and had not warned the parents, cast or crew of the children&#x27;s and Morrow&#x27;s proximity to explosives, or of limitations on their working hours. He admitted that he had violated California law regulating the employment of children by using the children after hours, and conceded that that was wrong, but still denied culpability. Numerous members of the film crew testified that the director was warned of the extreme hazard by technicians but ignored them. Metallurgist Gary Fowler testified that the heat from two explosions engulfed and delaminated the helicopter&#x27;s tail rotor, causing it to fall off, and that there had been &quot;no historical basis&quot; for the phenomenon.

Deputy District Attorney Lea Purwin D&#x27;Agostino stated that Landis was acting &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;slippery&quot; and &quot;glib&quot; during the trial, and that his testimony contained inconsistencies. After a ten-month jury trial that took place in 1986 and 1987, Landis—represented by criminal defense attorneys Harland Braun and James F. Neal—and the other crew members were acquitted of the charges.

Both Le&#x27;s and Chen&#x27;s parents later filed civil suits against Landis and other defendants and eventually settled out of court with the studio for $2 million per family. In 1988, Landis was reprimanded by the Directors Guild of America for unprofessional conduct on the set of the film and the California Labor Commission fined him $5,000 for violating child labor laws. Additionally, Cal/OSHA issued 36 citations and $62,375 in fines, although this amount was later reduced to $1,350. Warner Bros. vice president John Silvia also spearheaded a committee to create new safety standards for the film industry.

During an interview with journalist Giulia D&#x27;Agnolo Vallan, Landis said, &quot;When you read about the accident, they say we were blowing up huts—which we weren&#x27;t—and that debris hit the tail rotor of the helicopter—which it didn&#x27;t. The FBI Crime Lab, who was working for the prosecution, finally figured out that the tail rotor delaminated, which is why the pilot lost control. The special effects man who made the mistake by setting off a fireball at the wrong time was never charged.&quot;

===Subsequent film career===
&quot;Trading Places&quot;, a &quot;Prince and the Pauper&quot;–style comedy starring Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy, was filmed directly after the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; accident. After filming ended, Landis and his family went to London. The film, a big hit at the box office (the 4th-most-popular movie of 1983) did well enough for Landis&#x27; image and career to improve, along with his involvement with Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot;.

Next, Landis directed &quot;Into the Night&quot;, starring Jeff Goldblum, Michelle Pfeiffer and David Bowie, and appeared in the film, which was inspired by Hitchcock productions, as an Iranian hitman. To promote the film, Landis collaborated with Jeff Okun to direct a documentary film called &quot;B.B. King &quot;Into the Night&quot;&quot;.

His next film, &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (starring co-writer Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase), was an homage to the &quot;Road to ...&quot; films of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. It was the 10th-most-popular movie of 1985. Hope made a cameo in the Landis film, portraying himself.

In 1986, Landis directed &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, which featured Chevy Chase, Martin Short and Steve Martin. He then co-directed and produced the 1987 satirical comedy film &quot;Amazon Women on the Moon&quot;, which parodies the experience of watching low-budget films on late-night television.

Landis next directed the 1988 Eddie Murphy film &quot;Coming to America&quot;, which was hugely successful, becoming the third-most-popular movie of 1988 at the U.S. box office. It was also the subject of &quot;Buchwald v. Paramount&quot;, a civil suit filed by Art Buchwald in 1990 against the film&#x27;s producers. Buchwald claimed that the concept for the film had been stolen from a 1982 script that Paramount optioned from Buchwald, and won the breach of contract action.

In 1991, Landis directed Sylvester Stallone in &quot;Oscar&quot;, based on a stage play. &quot;Oscar&quot; recreates a 1930s-era film, including the gestures along with bit acts and with some slapstick, as an homage to old Hollywood films. In 1992, Landis directed &quot;Innocent Blood&quot;, a horror-crime film. In 1994, Landis directed Eddie Murphy in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot;, their third collaboration following &quot;Trading Places&quot; and &quot;Coming to America&quot;. In 1996, he directed &quot;The Stupids&quot; and then returned to Universal to direct &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; in 1998 with John Goodman and, for the fifth time in a Landis film, Dan Aykroyd, who also appeared in Landis&#x27; film &quot;Susan&#x27;s Plan&quot;, released that same year. None of the above six films scored well with critics or audiences.

&quot;Burke and Hare&quot; was released in 2010, as Landis&#x27; first theatrical release in 12 years.

In August 2011, Landis said he would return to horror and would be writing a new film. He was the executive producer on the comedy horror film &quot;Some Guy Who Kills People&quot;.

===Music videos===

Landis has directed several music videos. He was approached by Michael Jackson to make a video for his song &quot;Thriller&quot;. The resulting video significantly impacted MTV and the concept of music videos; it has won numerous awards, including the Video Vanguard Award for The Greatest Video in the History of the World. In 2009 (months before Jackson died), Landis sued the Jackson estate in a dispute over royalties for the video; he claimed to be owed at least four years&#x27; worth of royalties.

In 1991, Landis collaborated again with Michael Jackson on the music video for the song &quot;Black or White&quot;.

===Television===
Landis has been active in television as the executive producer (and often director) of the series &quot;Dream On&quot; (1990), &quot;Weird Science&quot; (1994), &quot;Sliders&quot; (1995), &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show&quot; (1997), &quot;Campus Cops&quot; (1995), &quot;The Lost World&quot; (1998), &quot;Masters of Horror&quot;, and various episodes of &quot;Psych&quot;. He also made commercials for DirecTV, Taco Bell, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Kellogg&#x27;s, and Disney. In 2011 he made an appearance in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton&#x27;s television series &quot;Psychoville&quot;. In June 2020, Landis signed on to direct and executive produce the streaming series &quot;Superhero Kindergarten&quot;.

===Documentaries===
Landis made his first documentary, &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, in 1982; it was only released on VHS. In 1983, he worked on the 45-minute documentary &quot;Making Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller&quot;, which aired on MTV and Showtime and was simultaneously released on home video, which became the biggest selling home video release of the time. Next, he co-directed &quot;B.B. King &quot;Into the Night&quot;&quot; (1985) and in 2002 directed &quot;Where Are They Now?: A Delta Alumni Update&quot;, which can be seen as a part of the &quot;Animal House&quot; DVD extras. Initially, his documentaries were only made to promote his feature films. Later in his career he became more serious about the oeuvre and made &quot;Slasher&quot; (2004), &quot;Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project&quot; (2007) and &quot;Starz Inside: Ladies or Gentlemen&quot; (2009) for television. Landis won a 2008 Emmy Award for &quot;Mr. Warmth&quot;. In 2023, he appeared in the Spanish documentary &quot;The Man Who Saw Frankenstein Cry&quot;, which covered the career of Spanish movie director Paul Naschy. Landis was friends with Christopher Lee and he appeared in the documentary &quot;The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee&quot; (2024).

==Archives==
Landis&#x27; moving image collection is held at the Academy Film Archive. The film material at the Archive is complemented by photographs, artwork and posters found in Landis&#x27; papers at the Academy&#x27;s Margaret Herrick Library.

==Personal life==
Landis is married to Deborah Nadoolman, a costume designer. They have two children, including Max. In a BBC Radio interview, he stated that he is an atheist. The family lives in Beverly Hills, California. They had purchased Rock Hudson&#x27;s estate in Beverly Crest.

In 2009, Landis signed a petition in support of director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown &quot;freely and safely&quot;, and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door &quot;for actions of which no-one can know the effects.&quot;

<doc id="663396" wikidata="Q156038" url="?curid=663396" title="Duchy of Courland and Semigallia">
<text>The Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was a duchy in the Baltic region, then known as Livonia, that existed from 1561 to 1569 as a nominal vassal state of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and subsequently made part of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom from 1569 to 1726 and incorporated into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1726. On October 24, 1795, it was annexed by the Russian Empire in the Third Partition of Poland.

There was also a short-lived wartime state with the same name that existed from March 8 to September 22, 1918. Plans for it to become part of the United Baltic Duchy, subject to the German Empire, were thwarted by Germany&#x27;s surrender of the Baltic region at the end of the First World War. The area became a part of Latvia at the end of World War I.

==History==
In 1561, during the Livonian Wars, the Livonian Confederation was dismantled and the Livonian Order was disbanded. On the basis of the Treaty of Vilnius, the southern part of Estonia and the northern part of Latvia were ceded to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. On 25 December 1566, the Union of Grodno established a real union between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Duchy of Livonia. The part of Latvia between the west bank of the Daugava River and the Baltic Sea became the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia. It was ruled by the dukes from the House of Kettler with the exception of Ernst Johann Biron and his son Peter von Biron.

Gotthard Kettler, the last Master of the Livonian Order, became the first duke of Courland. Other members of the Order became the Couronian nobility, with the fiefdoms they had hitherto held becoming their estates. In all, Kettler received nearly one-third of the land in the new duchy. Mitau (Jelgava) was designated as the new capital and a Landtag was to meet there twice a year.

Several parts of the Courish area did not belong to the Duchy. The Order of Livonia had already loaned the Grobiņa district (on the coast of Baltic Sea) to the Duke of Prussia. Another district, the former Bishopric of Courland, belonged to Magnus, son of the king of Denmark. He promised to transfer it to the Duchy of Courland after his death, but this plan failed and only later did Wilhelm Kettler regain this district.

Like the other members of the Order, Kettler was German and set about establishing the Duchy along the lines of similar German states. In 1570, he issued the &quot;Privilegium Gotthardinum&quot;, which allowed the landholders to enserf the native peasantry on their lands.

When Gotthard Kettler died in 1587, his sons, Friedrich and Wilhelm, became the dukes of Courland. They divided the Duchy into two parts in 1596. Friedrich controlled the eastern part, Semigalia (&quot;Zemgale&quot;), with his residence in Mitau (Jelgava). Wilhelm owned the western part, Courland (&quot;Kurzeme&quot;), with his residence in Goldingen (Kuldīga). Wilhelm regained the Grobiņa district when he married the daughter of the Duke of Prussia. He also paid out and regained control over the District of Pilten, but eventually, it fell to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Here he developed metalworking and shipyards, and the new ships delivered the goods of Courland to other countries.

However, relations between the duke and the landowners were quite hostile. In addition, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was the overlord of the Duchy of Courland, supported the landowners. Wilhelm expressed his disappointment with the landowners, but this ended with his removal from the duke&#x27;s seat in 1616. Finally, Wilhelm left Courland and spent the rest of his life abroad. Thus, Friedrich became the only duke of Courland after 1616.

From 1600 to 1629, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Sweden conducted a war with its main battlefields around Riga. As a result, Sweden gained control of what is today central and northern Latvia, which became Swedish Livonia. The Commonwealth retained the eastern part of the Duchy of Livonia, thereafter called Inflanty Voivodeship in Polish. Courland was also involved in this war, but did not suffer severe damage.

Under the next duke, Jacob Kettler, the Duchy reached the peak of its prosperity. During his travels in Western Europe, Jacob became a eager proponent of mercantilist ideas. Metalworking and shipbuilding became much more developed, and powder mills began producing gunpowder. Trading relations developed not only with nearby countries but also with Britain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. Jacob established the merchant fleet of the Duchy of Courland, with its main harbours in Ventspils and Libau.

===Colonization===

In 1651 the Duchy established its first colony in Africa, St. Andrews Island at the Gambia River, and founded Jacob Fort there. The main export goods included ivory, gold, furs and spices. Soon afterwards, in 1652, Courlanders established another colony, in Tobago in the West Indies. There the main export goods included sugar, tobacco, coffee and spices.

However, during this time, the Duchy of Courland remained an object of interest for both Sweden and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1655 the Swedish army entered the territory of the Duchy, starting the Swedish–Polish war (1655–1660). The Swedish army captured Duke Jacob (1658–1660). During this period, the Dutch took over both of Courland&#x27;s colonies that lacked supplies and manpower, and the merchant fleet and factories suffered destruction. This war ended with the peace Treaty of Oliwa (1660). Courland regained Tobago on the basis of the treaty and held it until 1689. Duke Jacob set about restoring the fleet and factories, but the Duchy of Courland never again reached its pre-war level of prosperity.

===18th century===

When Jacob died in 1682, his son, Friedrich Casimir, became the next duke. During his reign production continued to decrease. The duke himself was more interested in glamorous celebrations and spent more money than he had. This forced him to sell Tobago to the British. During this period, the Commonwealth increased its influence in the political and economic life of the Duchy. Additionally, Russia showed an interest in this area.

Friedrich Casimir died in 1698. His successor, Friedrich Wilhelm Kettler, was only six years old and was under the regency of his uncle Ferdinand – a Polish general. During this time the Great Northern War (1700–1721) began between Sweden and Russia with its allies – the Commonwealth, Saxony and Denmark. As a result of the war, Russia took control of Swedish Livonia starting in 1710. In Courland, Russia also had such a strong influence that its ambassador, Pyotr Bestuzhev, became the most powerful man in the duchy. The Tsar of Russia, Peter the Great, received a promise from Friedrich Wilhelm that he would marry one of the daughters of the tsar&#x27;s brother. By having this promise, Peter the Great wished to increase the influence of Russia in Courland. In 1710, Friedrich Wilhelm married Anna Ioannovna (later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from St Petersburg, he took ill and died. Anna ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730.

After the death of Friedrich Wilhelm, the next candidate for the seat of duke was Ferdinand Kettler, who, at the time, lived in Danzig. Because the law required the duke to reside within the Duchy, the Diet did not recognize him. Because Ferdinand was the last representative of Kettler&#x27;s family, a remarkable number of candidates tried to gain the dukedom during this period. One favorite was Maurice de Saxe, natural son of Augustus II the Strong, King of Poland. Saxe had managed to gain support and was even mentioned as marrying Anna Ioannovna, Duchess of Courland at that time.

He was elected duke in 1726, but only managed to maintain himself by force of arms till the next year. Russia disliked him and sent an army to western Courland to destroy Maurice&#x27;s base. When Catherine was Empress Peter Lacy was given responsibility for removing Maurice de Saxe from Courland.
As the result Maurice de Saxe had to leave Courland, and Russia increased its influence. This was achieved in good measure due to service of Peter Lacy who was governor of Livonia from 1727 until his death in 1751. Russian influence increased further when Frederick August III, the Elector of Saxony, in his successful bid to succeed his father on the Polish throne in the 1730s, agreed to grant Anna of Russia her choice of successor to the Courish duchy in exchange for Russian support in the War of the Polish Succession. (Because of the duchy&#x27;s position as a vassal of the Commonwealth and Ferdinand Kettler&#x27;s lack of issue, the duchy would otherwise formally have devolved onto the Polish throne.) Anna appointed Ernst Johann von Biron duke of Courland in 1737.
Von Biron received remarkable financial support from Russia and invested it in construction – for example, the Castle of Ruhenthal projected by the distinguished Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Anna Ivanovna died in 1740, resulting in von Biron&#x27;s exile to Siberia the following year. From there, through the Council of the Duke, he continued to control the Duchy, with the agreement of the king of Poland. However, the landowners of Courland disliked the agreement and even refused to follow the regulations of the Council of the Duke.

Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-Lüneburg was selected as Biron&#x27;s successor on June 27, 1741, with the support of his cousin Maria Theresa of Austria, but while he was in St Petersburg to get this title ratified, Elizabeth of Russia carried out a coup on December 6, 1741, and he lost the title.

King Augustus III of Poland proclaimed his son, Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, the next duke. Thus, the Duchy of Courland had two dukes simultaneously thereafter. The situation became extremely tense – one part of the Landtag of Courland accepted von Biron, the other, Carl of Saxony. The Empress Catherine II of Russia (reigned 1762–1796) solved this situation by recalling Ernst von Biron from exile in 1763. By doing this, she avoided the possible increase of influence of the Commonwealth in Courland. However, political fighting had exhausted Ernst Biron, and he turned the seat of duke over to his son, Peter von Biron, in 1769. But political tumult continued in Courland. Some landowners supported the Commonwealth, some Russia. Ultimately, Russia determined the further fate of Courland when with its allies it began the third division of Poland (1795). Given a &quot;nice recommendation&quot; by Russia, Duke Peter von Biron gave up his rights to Russia in 1795. With the signing of the final document on October 24, 1795, the Duchy of Courland was incorporated into the Russian Empire and title of Duke of Courland was added to the title of Russian emperors.

Wilson is the younger brother of actors Andrew Wilson and Owen Wilson.

==Early life==
Wilson was born in Dallas, the youngest of three sons of Robert Andrew Wilson, an advertising and television executive, and the former Laura Cunningham, a photographer. His family, originally from Massachusetts, is of Irish Catholic descent. 

All three Wilson boys attended St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas. According to Owen, Luke was voted class president the first year he attended St. Mark&#x27;s. He became interested in acting while attending Occidental College in Los Angeles.

==Career==
Wilson&#x27;s acting career began with the lead role in the short film &quot;Bottle Rocket&quot; in 1994 which was co-written by his older brother Owen and director Wes Anderson. It was remade as a feature-length film in 1996. After moving to Hollywood with his two brothers, he was cast opposite Calista Flockhart in &quot;Telling Lies in America&quot; and made a cameo appearance in the film-within-the-film of &quot;Scream 2&quot;, both in 1997. Wilson filmed back-to-back romantic films in 1998, opposite Drew Barrymore, &quot;Best Men&quot;, about a group of friends who pull off a heist on their way to a wedding, and &quot;Home Fries&quot; which is about two brothers interested in the same woman for different reasons. He played the physician beau of a schoolteacher in &quot;Rushmore&quot; (also released in 1998) also directed by Anderson and co-written by his brother Owen. 

In 1999, he portrayed Detective Carlson in &quot;Blue Streak&quot;. He later appeared opposite Frankie Muniz in the 2000 comedy-drama &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu in the 2000 action comedy &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, and Reese Witherspoon in the 2001 comedy &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;. It was followed by &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), &quot;Old School&quot; (2003), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; (2003), &quot;Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde&quot; (2003), and &quot;&quot; (2004). Wilson also had a role on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, as Michael Kelso&#x27;s older brother Casey Kelso appearing sporadically from 2002 through 2005.

In 2006, Wilson starred in &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;, opposite Uma Thurman, and &quot;Idiocracy&quot;, a dystopian comedy directed by Mike Judge. Wilson portrayed an ordinary serviceman frozen in a cryogenics project. He awakens after hundreds of years in an America which is significantly less intelligent.

In 2007, Wilson starred in the thriller &quot;Vacancy&quot;, opposite Kate Beckinsale, and &quot;Blonde Ambition&quot;. In the same year, he appeared in &quot;You Kill Me&quot;, &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;, and worked on &quot;Henry Poole is Here&quot; in La Mirada, California which was released in 2008. In 2009, he starred in &quot;Tenure&quot;. In 2010, he appeared in films &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot; and &quot;Middle Men.&quot; From 2011 to 2013 he starred in the HBO TV series &quot;Enlightened.&quot; He followed this up with roles in &quot;The Skeleton Twins&quot; (2014), &quot;Meadowland&quot; (2015), &quot;Brad&#x27;s Status&quot; (2017), and &quot;&quot; (2019).

Since 2020, Wilson stars in the DC Universe/The CW series &quot;Stargirl&quot; as sidekick-turned-mechanic-turned superhero Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.

In 2023, he starred in the HBO Max animated series &quot;Fired on Mars&quot; as Jeffrey Cooper, a graphic designer for a business on Mars whose life is changed upon his termination.

Wilson has written a Wright Brothers biopic with his brother Owen, in which they also plan to star.

==Personal life==
Wilson was formerly in a relationship with &quot;Home Fries&quot; co-star Drew Barrymore.

In a 2019 interview, he commented on the fact that he has publicly expressed interest in starting a family since 1996, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m 47, I&#x27;m ready for that. I need to get to work.&quot;

<text>Diana Dors (born Diana Mary Fluck; 23 October 19314 May 1984) was an English actress and singer.

Dors came to public notice as a blonde bombshell, much in the style of Americans Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield, and Mamie Van Doren. Dors was promoted by her first husband, Dennis Hamilton, mostly in sex film-comedies and risqué modelling. After it was revealed that Hamilton had been defrauding her, she continued to play up to her established image, and she made tabloid headlines with the parties reportedly held at her house. Later, she showed talent as a performer on TV, in recordings, and in cabaret, and gained new public popularity as a regular chat-show guest. She also gave well-regarded film performances at different points in her career.

According to film critic David Thomson, &quot;Dors represented that period between the end of the war and the coming of &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; in paperback, a time when sexuality was naughty, repressed, and fit to burst.&quot;

==Early life==
Diana Mary Fluck was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, on 23 October 1931 at the Haven Nursing Home. Her mother, Winifred Maud Mary (Payne), was married to Albert Edward Sidney Fluck, a railway clerk. Mary had been having an affair with another man, and when she announced she was pregnant with Diana, she admitted she had no idea if the other man or her husband was the father.

Diana was educated at a small private school, Selwood House, on Bath Road, Swindon, from which she was eventually expelled. Diana would repeatedly talk and otherwise misbehave during French lessons, being given by an elderly Czech Jewish refugee, who admonished her &quot;Pay attention. After the war, you will be able to go on holiday to France and speak with the locals.&quot; She replied &quot; Who wants to go to silly old France anyway?&quot;. At which point he threw a stick of chalk at her. She caught the chalk and threw it back at him, hitting him in the face, for which she was summarily expelled.

During the war, Diana dated a boy named Desmond Morris from the Boys&#x27; High School, also on Bath Road, Swindon. Morris, who was from one of the town&#x27;s wealthier, more prominent families, used to take her aboard his rowing boat on the lake in his family&#x27;s garden. The garden and lake later comprised Queen&#x27;s Park in Swindon. In the late 1960s, Morris (a zoologist) became famous as the author of &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; and presenter of the TV series adapted from the book.

From the age of eight, Hollywood actresses Veronica Lake, Lana Turner, and Jean Harlow became her heroines, and she enjoyed going to the cinema to watch them.

Towards the end of the war, Dors entered a beauty contest to find a pin-up girl for &quot;Soldier Magazine&quot;; she came in third place. This led her to work as a model in art classes, and she began to appear in such local theatre productions as &quot;A Weekend in Paris&quot; and&quot; Death Takes a Holiday.&quot;

==Early career==
===LAMDA===
Having excelled in her elocution studies, after lying about her age, at 14 she was offered a place to study at London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA), becoming the college&#x27;s youngest student, starting in January 1946.

She lodged at the Earl&#x27;s Court YWCA, and supplemented her £2-per-week allowance, most of which was spent on her lodgings, by posing for the London Camera Club for one guinea (£1, 1s in &quot;old money&quot;, £1.05 in &quot;new&quot;, ) an hour. Signed to the Gordon Harbord Agency in her first term, she won a bronze medal, awarded by Peter Ustinov, and in her second won a silver with honours.

===First films===
Just prior to LAMDA, Dors had unsuccessfully auditioned for the part of Kanchi in &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; that was played by Jean Simmons. She acted in public theatre pieces for LAMDA productions, one of which was seen by casting director Eric L&#x27;Epine Smith. He suggested Dors for what became the actor&#x27;s screen debut in the noir film &quot;The Shop at Sly Corner&quot; (1947). Dors was cast in a walk-on role that developed into a speaking part. Her pay rate was £8 per day for three days.

During the signing of contracts, in agreement with her father, she changed her contractual surname to Dors, the maiden name of her maternal grandmother; this was at the suggestion of her mother Mary. Dors later commented on her name:

Returning to LAMDA two weeks later, she was asked by her agent to audition for &quot;Holiday Camp&quot; (1947) by dancing a jitterbug with young actor John Blythe. Gainsborough Studios gave her the part at a rate of £10 per day for four days.

Dors&#x27; third film was &quot;Dancing with Crime&quot; (1947), shot at Twickenham Studios opposite Richard Attenborough during the coldest winter for nearly 50 years, for which she was paid £10 per day for 15 days.

Following her return to LAMDA, she graduated in spring 1947 by winning the London Films Cup, awarded to LAMDA by Sir Alexander Korda for the &quot;girl most likely to succeed in films.&quot; Greta Gynt presented the award to her at a ceremony. Dors timed her return to Swindon to visit her parents with the local release of &quot;The Shop at Sly Corner.&quot;

==Rank Organisation==
===Charm School===
At the age of 15, Dors signed a contract with the Rank Organisation, and joined J. Arthur Rank&#x27;s &quot;Charm School&quot; for young actors, subsequently appearing in many of their films. The Charm School had been established by producer Sydney Box, whom Rank appointed head of production at Gainsborough Studios, one of the companies under the Rank umbrella. (Other students of the school who went on to become famous included Petula Clark, Claire Bloom, and Christopher Lee.) Dors disliked the Charm School, but received more publicity than other students at the time in part because of her willingness to be photographed in glamour shots and attending premieres. An August 1947 article said her nickname was &quot;The Body&quot;.

Her first film under contract to Rank was &quot;Streets Paved with Water&quot;, where she was the fourth lead; filming started in July 1947, but was cancelled after a month. She had a small role as a maid in Gainsborough&#x27;s &quot;The Calendar&quot; (1948), and a good part in &quot;Good-Time Girl&quot; (1948), as a troubled teen being warned at the beginning and end of the film. She then played the role of Charlotte in Rank&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1948), directed by David Lean.

Dors had a bigger part in a B film, &quot;Penny and the Pownall Case&quot; (1948), a 50-minute movie for Highbury Productions. This was her first significant role, the second female lead after Peggy Evans. Bob Monkhouse wrote in his memoirs that, when he saw the film in the cinema, he thought it was &quot;really bad&quot; but was impressed by Dors. &quot;It was her energy that at first attracted me&quot;, he wrote. &quot;Her acting was raw but promising and her vitality made me remember her afterwards as if her part of the screen had been in colour.&quot;

In August 1948, Rank announced Dors would be one of its young players that it would be building up into stars. (The others included David Tomlinson, Susan Shaw, Patricia Plunkett, Sally Ann Howes, and Derek Bond.) In September, she was in &quot;A Boy, a Girl and a Bike&quot; (1949) by which stage her fee was £30 a week; she says that the movie took six months to shoot.

After a bit in &quot;My Sister and I&quot; (1948), Dors was given a showy comic-support part in &quot;Here Come the Huggetts&quot; (1948), a series that followed &quot;Holiday Camp&quot;, playing the lazy niece of the Huggetts, who causes trouble when she goes to stay with the family. Dors was so well received that she returned for the second movie in the series, &quot;Vote for Huggett&quot; (1949). Both were produced by Betty E. Box, who recalled, &quot;Diana was all woman&quot;, despite only being a teenager. &quot;She thought like a woman, acted like a woman, and looked like a woman.&quot; She was also in &quot;It&#x27;s Not Cricket&quot; (1949).

David Shipman later argued that when Dors &quot;was young she was very funny: she did a neat parody of the man-mad teenager, the nubile cousin who ogles the best man at the wedding breakfast, the office junior ready for a bit of slap and tickle behind the filing cupboard. She was the best thing about most of her early films.&quot;

===Leading lady===
Rank promoted Dors to leading roles in 1949&#x27;s &quot;Diamond City&quot;, the story of a boom town in South Africa in 1870. Jean Kent was originally cast as a saloon owner in love with hero David Farrar, who loves a missionary played by Honor Blackman; Kent turned down the role and Dors took over. Filming took place in late 1948 and early 1949, when Dors was only 17 years old. She was paid £30 a week. She says the part of &quot;Diana&quot; in &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; was written for her, but she lost it to Peggy Evans when the director decided he wanted &quot;a waif type&quot;; she also tested for the female lead in &quot;The Cure for Love&quot;, but lost out to Dora Bryan.

While waiting for &quot;Diamond City&quot; to come out, Rank sent Dors to appear with Barbara Murray in &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; at the Connaught Theatre, Worthing. She then appeared on stage in &quot;The Good Young Man&quot; with Digby Wolfe and in September 1949, with Marcel Le Bon in a touring production of &quot;Lisette&quot;, a three-act play by Douglas Sargeant&quot;.&quot;

In November 1949, Dors was contracted out to Ealing Studios, which put her in &quot;Dance Hall&quot; (1950), as one of the four female leads, along with Natasha Perry, Petula Clark, and Jane Hylton. Dors later called it &quot;a ghastly film – quite one of the nastiest I ever made&quot;, although she received good personal reviews.

In February 1950, she went into the play &quot;Man of the World&quot; with Roger Livesey and Lionel Jeffries, directed by Kenneth Tynan, which opened at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. It only had a short run, but she received strong personal notices and was awarded &quot;Theatre World&quot; magazine&#x27;s Actress of the Year award.

&quot;Diamond City&quot; flopped at the box office, though, and with Rank now £18 million (equivalent to £ in ) in debt, Rank closed their Charm School and made Dors redundant in September 1950. David Shipman argued that &quot;though the Rank Organization knew how to put Dors through its Charm School paces, they had no idea how to handle such an individual talent.&quot;

==British stardom==
Dors landed the female lead supporting Ronald Shiner in &quot;Worm&#x27;s Eye View&quot; (1951), a comedy that was one of the most popular movies of 1951 in Britain; her fee was £250. She had a leading role in a TV movie for the BBC, &quot;Face to Face&quot; (1951) then appeared in two plays – &quot;Miranda&quot; at Stratford, and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; at Henley. She auditioned for the lead in &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; and was turned down because it was felt she did not appeal to men and women, but she was given a support role. She later said her fee of £750 helped restore her financial situation.

===Dennis Hamilton===
With her boyfriend in jail and having just undergone her first abortion, Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins in May 1951 while filming &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; for Rank, a film that has uncredited appearances by Joan Collins and Ruth Ellis (then four months pregnant). (Dors described herself as &quot;the only sex symbol Britain has produced since Lady Godiva&quot;.) The couple married five weeks later at Caxton Hall on Monday, 3 July 1951.

Later that month, Dors starred in a British film noir &quot;The Last Page&quot; (1952), directed by Terence Fisher for Hammer Films in association with producer Robert L. Lippert; her fee was £450 for four weeks&#x27; work. Lippert reportedly offered Dors a one-picture deal on condition that she divorce Hamilton, but Dors refused.

Dors often played characters suffering from unrequited love, and by the mid-1950s, she was known as &quot;the English Marilyn Monroe&quot;. Hamilton also made sure that she had the lifestyle attachments of a sex symbol, agreeing to a lease-deal with Rolls-Royce such that a headline could be created in the tabloids that, at the age of 20, she was the youngest registered keeper of a Rolls-Royce in the UK.

Hamilton went to great lengths to advance Dors&#x27; career and his income or influence from it. After her death, friends and biographers said that Hamilton would lend Dors as a sexual favour to hiring producers and leading actors, much as in the &quot;casting couch&quot; practices of Hollywood.

Dors worked with Terry-Thomas on the TV series &quot;How Do You View?&quot; for £250. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; called her a &quot;charming addition to his crazy household.&quot;

In December 1951, a newspaper reported that the &quot;likeliest British names for glamour in 1952 are probably Britain&#x27;s Glynis Johns and plumpish Diana Dors. Both are going to Hollywood.&quot; She gained a second offer from Burt Lancaster for a lead role in his &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot; (1954), but this time Hamilton turned down the part on her behalf before she even knew of the offer. The result was that her early career was restricted to mainly British films.

===Theatre and Maurice Elvey===
In April 1952, Dors appeared in a stage revue with Wally Chrisham, &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, which eventually made it to London.&quot;Variety&quot; said in May she made the &quot;only noteworthy contribution&quot; to the play, which ultimately only had a short run. However under Hamilton&#x27;s guidance she received enormous publicity. Dors later said these reviews, in addition to Hamilton&#x27;s publicity, helped turn her career around. Dors later said Hamilton &quot;promoted me strictly as a sex symbol, never as an actress, but it served its purpose and at the time it was fun.&quot;

Laurence Olivier reportedly offered her a role in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, but Dors says the start date kept changing. Instead, she accepted an offer to appear in a show in Blackpool, &quot;Life with Lyons&quot; at a fee of £100 a week for three months. The &quot;Times&quot; newspaper reported on Tuesday 28 July 1953 (page 2) that Diana (under her married name Diana Mary Gittins) received an absolute discharge after being convicted of the theft of several bottles of spirits from a friend&#x27;s flat in Blackpool.

Dors&#x27; film career started to improve when she was cast in a support role in &quot;My Wife&#x27;s Lodger&quot; (1952), directed by Maurice Elvey, who subsequently cast her in a small role in another low-budget comedy called &quot;The Great Game&quot; (1953) made by Adelphi Films.

In December 1952, Dors appeared on stage in &quot;It Remains to be Seen&quot;, which only ran seven performances. The &quot;Observer&quot; said Dors &quot;bangs at it with goodwill.&quot; The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; said she &quot;carries blondeness to its ultimate pitch, works very hard, and is likeable as a good-hearted little trollop.&quot;

In March 1953, Dors did a cabaret act in Glasgow. &quot;Variety&quot; said she showed &quot;little ability to be a personality act.&quot; She began touring a variety act and performed variations of this act throughout her career.

Adelphi were impressed by Dors, announcing in February 1953 that they had bought the screen rights to the popular play &quot;Is Your Honeymoon Really Necessary?&quot; (1953) as a vehicle for Dors; it was directed by Elvey in April. Her fee was £1,000 for four weeks work. She was paid that for another comedy, &quot;It&#x27;s a Grand Life&quot; (1953) with Frank Randle.

Dors had a supporting part for Hammer in &quot;The Saint&#x27;s Return&quot; (1954). In September 1953 the producer of that movie, Julian Lesser, announced he had an option for Dors&#x27; services on two more movies.

===British stardom===
Dors&#x27; career stepped up another level when she was cast in a supporting role alongside Glynis Johns in a prison drama, &quot;The Weak and the Wicked&quot; (1954), directed by J. Lee Thompson. She made the movie in August 1953, only a few weeks after having been convicted in real life of stealing alcohol from a friend&#x27;s house. By this stage she was earning a reported £12,000 a year. When the film came out, it was a big hit in Britain and earned Dors some excellent reviews.

She played Aladdin as a Christmas pantomime in 1953 and did &quot;The Lovely Place&quot; for &quot;Rheingold Theatre&quot; on TV. In April 1954 she said &quot;I&#x27;m picking and choosing my parts now. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m waiting for the perfect part, but I&#x27;m sick to death of being the sexy siren.&quot;

In 1954, Hamilton had the idea of exploiting the newly printed technology of 3D. He engaged photographer Horace Roye to take a number of nude and seminude photographs of Dors, which Hamilton subsequently had published in two forms; the semi-nude pictures were issued as a set called &quot;Diana Dors 3D: the ultimate British Sex Symbol&quot;, which was sold together with a pair of 3D glasses; the full-nude test shot photographs became part of Roye&#x27;s booklet &quot;London Models&quot; (1954). Police pressed charges, alleging the books were obscene but a court ruled that they were not.

Adelphi called her back for &quot;Miss Tulip Stays the Night&quot; (1955) for a fee of £1,500. She then played one of the leads in &quot;A Kid for Two Farthings&quot; (1955), directed by Carol Reed in mid-1954 for Alex Korda, paid £1,700; the film was one of the most popular movies of 1955 in Britain. Dors was offered the female lead in Thompson&#x27;s &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot; (1955) with Jack Buchanan, but was unable to accept; she agreed to do a guest role, instead, at £200 a day.

In October 1954, questions were asked in Parliament about why she was allowed to claim her mink coat as a tax deduction.

In December 1954, she reportedly turned down a seven-year contract with Rank worth £100,000 (equivalent to £ in ) because she could make more freelance. She did sign a three-picture deal with Rank worth £15,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The first of these was &quot;Value for Money&quot; (1955) for director Ken Annakin starring with John Gregson, filmed in early 1955, and &quot;An Alligator Named Daisy&quot; (1955), directed by Thompson, also for Rank, starring Donald Sinden.

The success of her movies, particularly &quot;Kid for Two Farthings&quot;, led to British exhibitors voting her the ninth-most popular British star at the box office in 1955 – the sole female star in the top 10. She ranked after Dirk Bogarde, John Mills, Norman Wisdom, Alastair Sim, Kenneth More, Jack Hawkins, Richard Todd, and Michael Redgrave, and in front of Alec Guinness. In November 1955 the press criticised her for wearing revealing necklines when meeting royalty.

Dors made a fourth film with Thompson, &quot;Yield to the Night&quot; (1956), filmed in late 1955. It was a crime drama with Dors playing a role similar to Ruth Ellis. She received some of the best reviews of her career. She was acclaimed at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. J. Lee Thompson said he cast Dors in &quot;Yield&quot; over the objections of the studio who wanted Olivia de Havilland adding in May 1956 that &quot;I must find a new part for Diana Dors. I&#x27;m looking for one all the time. It isn&#x27;t easy because you can&#x27;t take chances with Diana - not any more...&quot; But she would never work with Thompson again.

Dors turned down the female lead in Rank&#x27;s &quot;The Big Money&quot;. On being offered that role and turning it down, she said:If that&#x27;s the best you can offer, then I&#x27;m rather surprised […] They still think I&#x27;m only good for the dumb blonde parts I played five years ago, I thought everyone in the business knew I&#x27;d come some way since then.

She later said:After I did &quot;Yield to the Night&quot;, it [all the publicity] went a bit sour. It should have been toned down to give me the chance to become a serious actress.

==Hollywood==
===RKO===

Dors&#x27; performance attracted interest in Hollywood. In February 1956, she guest-starred on a TV special Bob Hope made in England.

In May 1956, Dors signed a contract with RKO to support George Gobel in &quot;I Married a Woman&quot;. She left Southampton on board the for New York City and then to Hollywood. She said: I&#x27;m hoping to enjoy myself, keep my sense of fun and do a good job. It took me 10 years [of] hard work in poor[ly received] pictures, in revue, in straight plays, and touring to become a star, and I don&#x27;t intend to let Hollywood push me about, crop my hair, change my style or personality.

In July 1956, Dors—through her company, Treasure Pictures—signed a contract with RKO Pictures to make three more movies, the first of which was to be &quot;The Unholy Wife&quot; (1957) with Rod Steiger, which started filming in September. Her fee was a reported $75,000 (), with the other films to go up $25,000. Dors reportedly had an affair with Rod Steiger during the filming of &quot;The Unholy Wife&quot;. In October 1956, Hamilton started an affair with Raymond &quot;Mr. Teasy-Weasy&quot; Bessone&#x27;s estranged wife in London. In November, Dors announced Hamilton and she were separating. Dors later said, &quot;They tried getting me in the gas chamber again in Hollywood [...] but [the film] wasn&#x27;t good. They edited it badly.&quot;
William Dozier of RKO announced Dors would star in &quot;Blondes Prefer Gentlemen&quot; with Eddie Fisher, but the film was never made. In August 1956, she announced she had signed a one-picture deal to appear in a Bob Hope movie. This never happened; neither did a project Robert Aldrich announced he wanted to make with Dors and Paul Douglas at UA, &quot;Potluck for Pomeroy&quot;.

Due to meet Hollywood columnists Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, interviews were arranged to be held at the Hollywood home of her friend, celebrity hairdresser Mr. Teasy-Weasy, who owned a Spanish-style villa off Sunset Boulevard, formerly owned by Marlene Dietrich. To coincide with the publication of the articles, Hamilton and Raymond arranged a Hollywood launch party at Raymond&#x27;s house in August 1956, with a guest list that included Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Liberace, Lana Turner, Ginger Rogers, and John Wayne. After 30 minutes, while lining up next to Raymond&#x27;s pool with her US agent Louis Shurr and her dress designer Howard Shoup, all four, including Dors and Hamilton, were pushed into the pool after the party crowd and photographers surged forward. Hamilton emerged from the pool and hit the first photographer before he could be restrained. The headlines in the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; read: &quot;Miss Dors Go Home—And Take Mr. Dors With You&quot;. Because of the resulting negative publicity, the couple failed to buy Lana Turner&#x27;s house, settling into a rental property in Coldwater Canyon.

She was meant to make three films produced by Anna Neagle, the first with Frankie Vaughan called &quot;The Cast Iron Shore&quot;; however, Dors pulled out in September.

In October, Dors appeared again on the &quot;Bob Hope Show&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said she &quot;displayed considerable stage presence. The gal can handle her lines.&quot; Hedda Hopper reported around this time that Dors had replaced her agent &quot;and her popularity is slipping even before her first film is shown.&quot; Hopper also said Dors&#x27; fee for British films was now $40,000, up from $20,000. In November, Dors, returning to London, announcing she and Hamilton had separated, with the latter blaming Steiger.

===Return to Britain===

In England she made &quot;The Long Haul&quot; (1957) for Columbia with Victor Mature, which started filming in February 1957. While making &quot;The Long Haul&quot;, Dors started a relationship with co-star Mature&#x27;s stuntman, Tommy Yeardye. Details about the affair were reportedly leaked to the press by Yeardye.

Gerd Oswald wanted her for &quot;The Blonde&quot;. In October 1957, Hedda Hopper reported that Dors intended to make the last two films under her RKO contract, but Hopper thought, &quot;she was just whistling Dixie.&quot;

She went to Italy to play an American in the French-Italian &quot;The Love Specialist&quot; (1957) with Vittorio Gassman. Dors stayed in crime for &quot;Tread Softly Stranger&quot; (1958), made for Gordon Parry with George Baker co-starring. She later said her three 1957 films made her £27,000.

Gassman and she were to reunite in &quot;Strange Holiday&quot;, but it was not made. She was a prostitute in &quot;Passport to Shame&quot; (1958). In August 1958, she reported she had been robbed of £11,000. She made a series of advertisements believed to have earned her £25,000.

Dors&#x27; RKO films flopped, so RKO elected not to make the other two films. In December 1958, RKO terminated its contract with Dors, alleging she &quot;has become an object of disgrace, obloquy, ill will, and ridicule.&quot; Dors sued the studio for $1,250,000 in damages. (In July 1960, she settled for $200,000.)

Joseph Kaufman announced he wanted to make a film starring her called &quot;Stopover&quot;, but it was never made. In May 1959, she said she wanted to retire from acting and focus on her other interests, including a shampoo factory. She had a cameo on &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot; shot in Spain.

===Cabaret===
Following her final separation from Hamilton in 1958, Dors discovered that her company, Diana Dors Ltd, was in serious debt. Hamilton had steered the company toward the dual purpose of publicising his wife and helping himself, over paying tax bills and establishing financial stability. Having been forced by Hamilton &quot;at gunpoint&quot; to sign over all of her assets prior to the end of their marriage, and in need of money to pay her divorce lawyers and their accountants, she agreed to the suggestion of agent Joseph Collins to undertake a theatre-based cabaret tour titled &quot;The Diana Dors Show&quot;. In July 1958, Dors was the top of the bill act at a cabaret in Coventry, being paid £2,500 a week.

Yeardye suggested that they hire comedian Dickie Dawson, later known as Richard Dawson; Dawson subsequently scripted the show and wrote most of the material. Dors started a relationship with Dawson and ended the relationship with Yeardye, who subsequently emptied her cash box at Harrods of £18,000 and sold his story to the media. This brought negative publicity to the show, but audience numbers remained high, which allowed Dors extra time to explain her affairs to a subsequent Inland Revenue investigation of her cash holdings. In 1959, Hamilton died, and Dors married Dawson in New York while making an appearance on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. &quot;The Diana Dors Show&quot; was commissioned for two studio-based series on television at ITV.

In 1959, &quot;Variety&quot; said Sabrina was &quot;to Diana Dors in Britain what Jayne Mansfield is to Marilyn Monroe.&quot;

In 1960, it was announced Dors and Dawson would make a film of the stage show &quot;Grab Me a Gondola&quot;, but it never happened.

&quot;Filmink&quot; magazine said, &quot;no decent British film roles seemed forthcoming&quot; around this time. &quot;The Rank Organisation, who could have used Dors around this time, did not seem interested. Neither did Hammer Films, who were experiencing global success with their horror movies. Perhaps most frustratingly for Dors, J. Lee Thompson, who had given her the two best opportunities, made a series of films featuring parts that Dors could have played, but which, for whatever reason, were taken by other actors.&quot;

===Back in Hollywood===
After the birth of her first child in February 1960, and wishing to stay in the United States with Dawson, Dors undertook a cabaret contract to headline at the Dunes hotel and casino in Las Vegas. In September 1960, she did a cabaret act at Ciro&#x27;s, which &quot;Variety&quot; said was &quot;pleasant enough&quot;.

She appeared in some American films: &quot;On the Double&quot; (1961), a Danny Kaye comedy, and &quot;The Big Bankroll&quot; (1962), a crime film also known as &quot;King of the Roaring 20&#x27;s: The Story of Arnold Rothstein&quot;. She also sold her memoirs to News of the World for $140,000. She later claimed she turned down a role in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;. She was meant to be in &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; with Jerry Lewis but was fired at the last minute.

During the summer of 1961, Dors shot &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;, based on Robert Bloch&#x27;s story, for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. The episode was so gruesome that it was suppressed for decades.

Dors returned to Britain. In 1961, she narrowly escaped death at a Guy Fawkes Night party in Wraysbury, where fireworks were accidentally ignited indoors. The house was destroyed, three people died in the fire and another one had a fatal heart attack, and Dors was slightly injured while escaping through a window.

She appeared in &quot;Mrs. Gibbons&#x27; Boys&quot; (1962), &quot;West 11&quot; (1963), &quot;The Counterfeit Constable&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Sandwich Man&quot; (1966).

In the early 1960s, she was living in Los Angeles. While there she guest starred on episodes of &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, and starred in a 1963 episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; titled &quot;Run for Doom&quot;, co-starring John Gavin, and episodes of &quot;Straightaway&quot; and &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; in Britain.

She toured Australia in 1963. While there, she said 1956 was &quot;my biggest year, and you never can tell whether you will do it again. That is what makes show business so fascinating —you never can tell.&quot;

==Later career==
===Bankruptcy===
Dors divorced Dawson in 1966 and returned to the UK to find work, leaving behind her two sons. She resumed cabaret work with her pianist and musical director Denny Termer, and subsequently was served with a writ of bankruptcy. As her popularity had fallen, this time she was touring working men&#x27;s clubs, and smaller venues.

In June 1968, she reported that she owed £53,000, of which £48,000 was to the Inland Revenue, and had assets of a little over £200. She declared bankruptcy in October 1968.

Dors&#x27; film career was now strictly supporting roles: &quot;Danger Route&quot; (1967); &quot;Berserk!&quot; (1967), with Joan Crawford; &quot;Hammerhead&quot; (1968); &quot;Baby Love&quot; (1968); &quot;Deep End&quot; (1970); and &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; (1970). She returned to the West End in 1970 for the first time in 17 years in a play called &quot;Three Months Gone&quot;.

===TV stardom and supporting film roles===
Dors played the title role in the sitcom, &quot;Queenie&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1970–72), which ran for three series. Less popular was the follow-up, &quot;All Our Saturdays&quot; (1973). During this period, she appeared in a TV adaptation of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1971) and episodes of &quot;Z Cars&quot;, &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;, &quot;Just William&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot;, and &quot;Shoestring&quot;.

Dors&#x27; film work included &quot;Hannie Caulder&quot; (1971); &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; (1972); &quot;The Amazing Mr. Blunden&quot; (1972); &quot;Swedish Wildcats&quot; (1972); &quot;Nothing but the Night&quot; (1972); &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot; (1973); &quot;Steptoe and Son Ride Again&quot; (1973); &quot;From Beyond the Grave&quot; (1973); and &quot;Craze&quot; (1974).

In the mid-1970s, she became in high demand for sex comedies: &quot;The Amorous Milkman&quot; (1975), &quot;Bedtime with Rosie&quot; (1975), &quot;What the Swedish Butler Saw&quot; (1975), &quot;Three for All&quot; (1976), &quot;Adventures of a Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), &quot;Keep It Up Downstairs&quot; (1976), &quot;Adventures of a Private Eye&quot; (1977), and &quot;Confessions from the David Galaxy Affair&quot; (1979).

In 1974, she appeared on stage in a production of &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;.

In 1977, she won a court battle to prevent Wolf Rilla from writing a biography based on interviews she had done with Rilla.

===Final years===

Still making headlines in the &quot;News of the World&quot; and other print media in the late 1970s thanks to her adult parties, in her later years, Dors&#x27; status began to revive.

In 1979 while touring Australia, she said, &quot;I used to think it was a lot of hooey that life begins at 40. But I know what I can put up with; I&#x27;ve mellowed. I&#x27;m a homey person, although I don&#x27;t expect people to believe it.&quot;

Although her film work consisted mainly of sex comedies, her popularity climbed thanks to her television work, where her wit, intelligence, and catchy one-liners developed as a cabaret performer won over viewers. She became a regular on &quot;Jokers Wild&quot;, &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot;, and was a regular guest on BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;The Law Game&quot;. She also had a recurring role in &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; in 1980. A popular chat-show guest, an entire show – &quot;Russell Harty: At Home with Dors&quot; – came from the pool room of her home, Orchard Manor. Younger musical artists engaged her persona, brought about after the 1981 Adam and the Ants music video &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, where she played the fairy godmother opposite Adam Ant, who played a male Cinderella figure.

Dors&#x27; other final appearances were in a BBC tv adaptation of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; (1980), &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; (1981), &quot;Dick Turpin&quot; (1981), and &quot;Cannon and Ball&quot; (1981).

Having turned her life story into a cash flow through interviews and leaked tabloid stories, like many celebrities in their later careers, she turned to an autobiography to generate retirement cash. In 1960, she wrote and published &quot;Swingin&#x27; Dors&quot;, and between 1978 and 1984, she published four autobiographical books under her own name: &quot;For Adults Only&quot;, &quot;Behind Closed Dors&quot;, &quot;Dors by Diana&quot;, and &quot;A. to Z. of Men&quot;.

Diana Dors was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in April 1957, when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and in October 1982, when Andrews surprised her at London&#x27;s Royalty Theatre.

By the early 1980s, when she went through her first round of cancer treatment, her weight had significantly increased; she addressed the issue through co-writing a diet book, and creating a diet and exercise videocassette. This resulted in her working for TV-am, ITV&#x27;s breakfast station, in the summer of 1983, in a regular slot focusing on diet and nutrition, which later developed into an agony aunt segment. As the cancer treatment took its toll again, however, her appearances became less frequent. She sued the show for withholding her fan mail.

Her last public appearance was in cabaret at Harpoon Louie&#x27;s, Earl&#x27;s Court, West London, on 15 April 1984, where she looked considerably frail, but stood throughout her whole set. Her final (posthumous) film appearance was in &quot;Steaming&quot; (1985).

==Discography==

The earliest recordings of Dors were two sides of a 78-rpm single released on His Master&#x27;s Voice in 1953. The tracks were &quot;I Feel So Mmmm&quot; and &quot;A Kiss and a Cuddle (and a Few Kind Words from You)&quot;. His Master&#x27;s Voice also released sheet music featuring sultry photos of Dors on the cover. She also sang &quot;The Hokey Pokey Polka&quot; on the 1954 soundtrack for the film &quot;As Long as They&#x27;re Happy&quot;. Dors recorded only one complete album, the swing-themed &quot;Swingin&#x27; Dors&quot;, in 1960. The LP was originally released on red vinyl and with a gatefold sleeve. The accompanying orchestra was conducted by Wally Stott. 
She also sang as a special guest for the Italian TV show &quot;Un, due, tre&quot; (&quot;One, two, three&quot;, starring Ugo Tognazzi and Raimondo Vianello) on 31 May 1959, at the Teatro della Fiera in Milan, with the orchestra conducted by Mario Bertolazzi, and recorded singles on various record labels from the 1960s through the early 1980s, including a single for the Nomis label, &quot;Where Did They Go?&quot; / &quot;It&#x27;s You Again&quot; (the latter being a duet with her son, Gary Dawson), while she was being treated for cancer. While promoting the single on TV, Dors claimed &quot;Where Did They Go?&quot; had been especially written for her, but in fact, the track had been recorded originally by Peggy Lee in 1971 and in 1972 by Sandie Shaw.

==Personal life==
Dors was married three times:
*Dennis Hamilton Gittins (3 July 1951 – 3 January 1959, his death): married five weeks after meeting, at Caxton Hall; no children; lived in London, Berkshire, and Hollywood
*Richard Dawson (12 April 1959 – 1966, divorced): married in New York; two sons, Mark Dawson and Gary Dawson; lived in London, New York, and Hollywood
*Alan Lake (23 November 1968 – 4 May 1984, her death): married at Caxton Hall; one son, Jason Lake; lived at Orchard Manor, Sunningdale, Berkshire

In 1949, while filming &quot;Diamond City&quot;, she had a relationship with businessman Michael Caborn-Waterfield, who later founded the Ann Summers chain, which he named after a former girlfriend. During the short relationship, Dors became pregnant, but Caborn-Waterfield paid for a back-street abortion, which took place on a kitchen table in Battersea. The relationship continued for a time, before Dors met Dennis Hamilton Gittins on the set of &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot;, and while with him she had a second abortion in 1951.

Dors is said to have become a close friend of Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, after Ellis had a bit part in &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot;. However, Dors never mentioned having known Ellis, either in interviews or in her memoirs. Through her husband Hamilton, Dors was close friends with the notorious Kray twins and their mother Violet.

===Parties===
During her relationship with Hamilton, and until a few months before her death, Dors regularly held adult parties at her home. There, a number of celebrities, amply supplied with alcohol and drugs, mixed with young starlets against a background of both softcore and hardcore porn films. Dors gave all her guests full access to the entire house; her son Jason Lake later alleged in various media interviews and publications that she had equipped it with 8 mm movie cameras. The young starlets were made aware of the arrangements and were allowed to attend for free in return for making sure that their celebrity partners performed in bed at the right camera angles. Dors later enjoyed watching the films, keeping an archive of the best performances.

Dors became an early subject of the &quot;celebrity exposé&quot; tabloids, appearing regularly in the &quot;News of the World&quot;. In large part, she brought this notoriety upon herself. In desperate need of cash after her separation from Hamilton in 1958, she gave an interview in which she described their lives and the adult group parties in full, frank detail. The interview was serialised in the tabloid for 12 weeks, followed by an extended six-week series of sensational stories, creating negative publicity. Subsequently, the Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher denounced Dors as a &quot;wayward hussy&quot;.

However, other mainstream news media, on television and film, were unwilling to repeat the stories until well after Dors&#x27; death. This was in part because of her popularity, and also partly because of who was attending the parties. Her former lover and party guest Bob Monkhouse later commented in an interview after Dors&#x27; death, &quot;The awkward part about an orgy, is that afterwards you&#x27;re not too sure who to thank.&quot;

==Death==
Towards the end of her life, Dors had meningitis and twice underwent surgery to remove cancerous tumours. She collapsed at her home near Windsor with acute stomach pains and died on 4 May 1984, aged 52, at the BMI Princess Margaret Hospital in Windsor from a recurrence of ovarian cancer, first diagnosed two years before.

She had converted to Catholicism in early 1973; hence, her funeral service was held at the Sacred Heart Church in Sunningdale on 11 May 1984, conducted by Father Theodore Fontanari. She was buried in Sunningdale Catholic Cemetery.

===Alan Lake suicide===
After her death, Alan Lake burned all of Dors&#x27; remaining clothes and fell into a depression. On 10 October 1984, Lake did a telephone interview with &quot;Daily Express&quot; journalist Jean Rook and then walked into their son&#x27;s bedroom and took his own life by firing a shotgun into his mouth. He was 43. This was five months after her death from cancer, and 16 years to the day since they had first met. Alan had no alcohol or illegal drugs in his system at the time of his death.

Her home for the previous 20 years, Orchard Manor, was sold by the solicitors. The house&#x27;s contents were bulk-sold by Sotheby&#x27;s, which sold her jewellery collection in an auction. After solicitors&#x27; bills, outstanding tax payments, death duties, and other distributions, the combined estates of Dors and Lake left little for the upkeep of their son Jason (aged 14), who was subsequently made a ward of court to his half-brother Gary Dawson in Los Angeles.

=== Jason Dors-Lake&#x27;s death ===
On 14 September 2019, Jason Dors-Lake, the son of Diana Dors and Alan Lake, was reported to have died three days after his 50th birthday at his flat in Notting Hill Gate, London, from the combined effects of alcohol and tramadol intoxication.

== Commemoration in Swindon ==

Dors is commemorated in her home town of Swindon.

=== Statue ===
A larger-than-life bronze statue of Dors by John Clinch was erected outside the cinema at Shaw Ridge in West Swindon in 1991. It depicts an exaggerated version of her wearing an evening gown.
=== Blue plaque ===
Swindon Heritage unveiled a blue plaque to Dors in 2017 on the boundary of numbers 61 and 62 Kent Road in the Old Town area of Swindon. At the time, the two properties were the Haven Nursing Home where she was born. The plaque was unveiled by her son Jason Dors-Lake and her granddaughter Ruby Lake. Dors&#x27; 1959 pink Cadillac, which was a gift to her from Shepperton Studios, was parked outside during the unveiling.

=== Bust ===
The collection of Swindon Museum and Art Gallery includes a bronze bust of Dors by Enid Mitchell. It was originally unveiled at the Wyvern Theatre in the town in 1988, where it was displayed in the foyer until 2013, when it was moved to Swindon Central Library. It remained on display there until it was rehoused in the Museum and Art Gallery in 2015.

==In popular culture==
Dors was portrayed by Keeley Hawes (younger) and Amanda Redman (older) in the TV biographical film &quot;The Blonde Bombshell&quot; (1999).

On the cover of the 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; by the Beatles, Dors&#x27; wax figure appears in the collage of celebrities, on the right below the tree.

The Kinks paid homage to her when they included the Ray Davies-penned tribute tune &quot;Good Day&quot; on their album &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;.

After appearing as Adam Ant&#x27;s fairy godmother in his music video &quot;Prince Charming&quot;, Dors was also included in the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Scorpios&quot; with lyrics &quot;Black&#x27;s the colour watch the claws, With nails as sharp as Diana Dors&quot;.

Dors was the cover star of the Smiths&#x27; album &quot;Singles&quot;.

==Alleged fortune==
Dors claimed to have hidden away more than £2 million in banks across Europe. In 1982, she gave her son Mark Dawson a sheet of paper on which, she told him, was a code that would reveal the whereabouts of the money. His stepfather Alan Lake supposedly knew the key that would crack the code, but he died by suicide soon after her death and Dawson was left with an apparently unsolvable puzzle.

He sought out computer forensic specialists Inforenz, who recognised the encryption as the one attributed to Blaise de Vigenère, (Vigenère cipher), but actually invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso. Inforenz then used their own cryptanalysis software to suggest a 10-letter decryption key, DMARYFLUCK (short for Diana Mary Fluck, Dors&#x27;s real name). With the aid of a bank statement found among Alan Lake&#x27;s papers, Inforenz was then able to decode the existing material to reveal a list of surnames and towns only – suggesting that there must be a second page that would reveal first names and bank details, to complete the message. As this has never come to light, no money has ever been traced. In 2003, Channel 4 made a television programme about the mystery.

<text>Ubangi-Shari () was a French colony in central Africa, a part of French Equatorial Africa. It was named after the Ubangi and Chari rivers along which it was colonised. It was established on 29 December 1903, from the Upper Ubangi (&#x27;) and Upper Shari (&#x27;) territories of the French Congo; renamed the Central African Republic (CAR) on 1 December 1958; and received independence on 13 August 1960.

==History==

French activity in the area began in 1889 with the establishment of the outpost Bangi at the head of navigation on the Ubangi.

The Upper Ubangi was established as part of the French Congo on 9 December 1891. Despite a France-Congo Free State convention establishing a border around the 4th parallel, the area was contested from 1892 to 1895 with the Congo Free State, which claimed the region as its territory of Ubangi-Bomu (&quot;&quot;). The Upper Ubangi was a separate colony from 13 July 1894 until 10 December 1899, at which time it was folded back into the French Congo. The Upper Shari region was established as part of the French Congo on 5 September 1900. That same year the Company of the Upper Ubangi Sultanates took over 140,000 km2 of Upper Ubangi as a concession.

The territories were united as the separate colony of Ubangi-Shari on 29 December 1903, following the French defeat of Abbas II of Egypt, who had claimed the area. On 11 February 1906, this colony merged with the French settlements around Lake Chad and became the Ubangi-Shari territory of Ubangi-Shari-Chad (&quot;&quot;). In 1909, it received the administration over the sultanates of Zemio and Rafai from the Belgian Congo. 

On 15 January 1910, this administration was merged with French Congo and Gabon as the Ubangi-Shari area of French Equatorial Africa (FEA). On 12 April 1916, it again became the separate colony of Ubangi-Shari, but in 1920 lost the territory around Lake Chad, and on 30 June 1934, was again folded into FEA. As a part of FEA, it was declared an overseas territory on 31 December 1937.

Between 1915 and 1931, stamps were overprinted for use in Ubangi-Shari, and later specially printed for the colony.

During World War II, it remained loyal to Vichy France from 16 June to 29 August 1940, before being taken by the Free French. It was granted autonomy as the Central African Republic on 1 December 1958, and independence under the same name on 13 August 1960.

=== Concession systems and atrocities ===
Ubangi-Shari had a similar concession system as the Congo Free State and similar atrocities were also committed there. French author and Nobel laureate André Gide travelled to Ubangi-Shari and was told by inhabitants about atrocities including mutilations, dismemberments, executions, the burning of children, and villagers being forcibly bound to large beams and made to walk until dropping from exhaustion and thirst. 

The book &quot;Travels to Congo&quot; by Gide, published in 1927 describes the horrors of the concession companies in French Equatorial Africa. The book had an important impact on the anti-colonialist movement in France. The number of victims under the French concession system in Ubangi-Shari and other parts of French Equatorial Africa remains unknown.

<text>Manfreda was a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Agavoideae. Along with &quot;Polianthes&quot;, members are commonly called tuberoses. The generic name honours 14th-century Italian writer Manfredus de Monte Imperiale. All species are now placed in &quot;Agave&quot;. (See &quot;Agave&quot; § Taxonomy.)

Like other species of &quot;Agave&quot;, former &quot;Manfreda&quot; species have rosettes of leaves branching from a very short stem, and flowers at the end of a long stalk. The flowers are tubular and whitish, yellow, green, or brownish, with lengthy stamens.

<doc id="663416" wikidata="Q12061724" url="?curid=663416" title="Melinda Messenger">
<text>Melinda Jane Messenger (born 23 February 1971) is an English television presenter and former glamour model and Page Three girl. She presented the magazine programme &quot;Live from Studio Five&quot; and was formerly the co-presenter of the reality show &quot;Cowboy Builders&quot;.

==Early life==
Messenger was born on 23 February 1971 in Swindon, Wiltshire. After attending different schools, one of which was Dorcan Technology College, she spent six months working as a flight attendant for Britannia Airways. She then joined a local marketing company and rose to become customer services manager, overseeing a staff of 50 employees.

==Career==
===Modelling===
Messenger decided to become a model, and was advised by the Jason Paul Modelling Agency to enhance her breasts, which she enlarged from a 34C to a 34DD cup. She then took a job modelling for a Gloucester-based double glazing company, Glevum, dressed only in lingerie. As part of an advertising campaign called &quot;Class Behind Glass&quot;, the posters quickly began disappearing from bus stops, having been taken by locals. After a complaint at the lack of clothes on Messenger, the Advertising Standards Authority banned the campaign, claiming they were not sufficiently &quot;classy&quot;.

After local newspapers reported on this, the &quot;Daily Star&quot; ran the story on 28 January 1997 as a photo-shoot of Messenger, under the headline &quot;Move Over Eva Herzigova&quot;. 

Signed by modelling agent Yvonne Paul, who had steered Samantha Fox to fame in the 1980s, Messenger&#x27;s career accelerated. She posed for designers including Vivienne Westwood, then appeared on &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Page Three; the publication later hailed her as the &quot;Girl of the Thrillenium!&quot; Her work for the newspaper entailed visiting the Spanish coasts and English seaside resorts, an assignment known as &quot;Mel&#x27;s Big Bus Tour&quot;.

===Move from modelling===
Messenger appeared in a cameo role in 1999&#x27;s &quot;Virtual Sexuality&quot; as Superbra Girl, and costarred in the 2000 cult film &quot;The Mumbo Jumbo&quot; in the role of Princess Vanilla. She worked on Channel 4 cult show &quot;Eurotrash&quot; and became a popular pantomime actress, taking on roles such as &quot;Cinderella&quot; (2004–2005) and &quot;Aladdin&quot; (with Bobby Davro and John Rhys-Davies; Woking – 2005–2006).

=== Motherhood and becoming a presenter ===
Following the birth of her first child on 7 April 2000, by emergency caesarian section after she collapsed with pre-eclampsia, Messenger concentrated on developing her career as a television presenter.

Messenger released her &quot;Back into Shape Workout&quot; DVD, which was a six-week fitness programme designed to help new mothers recover their fitness. She appeared on &quot;Noel Edmonds – Gotcha!&quot; in which she was one of the subjects to receive the treatment from Noel and his team.

Messenger had her own issue of &quot;At Home With...&quot; magazine called &quot;At Home With Melinda Messenger&quot;, which was aimed at parents. She joined with chef Antony Worrall Thompson in May 2008 and contributed some recipes for the cookbook &quot;The Sweet Life&quot;.

===Television===

Messenger&#x27;s TV career began in 1997 on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Eurotrash&quot;, where she featured as a &quot;roving reporter&quot; in erotic scenarios, including modelling fetish wear and acting as a nude magician&#x27;s assistant.

In 1998–99 she hosted her own show on Channel 5 called &quot;Melinda&#x27;s Big Night In&quot;.

From 1998 to 2001, Messenger presented the Channel 5 game show &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;, which ran for four series. She joined ex-&quot;EastEnders&quot; star Leslie Grantham and &quot;Catweazle&quot; star Geoffrey Bayldon in the game show which tested contestants&#x27; physical agility and brainpower on the sea fortress in France.

In 1999, Messenger presented the game show &quot;Beat the Crusher&quot; with Freddie Starr.

In 2002, she appeared on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. She has since presented many TV programmes, including &quot;Loose Lips&quot; (with Richard Arnold), &quot;Baby Baby&quot;, &quot;Can We Still Be Friends&quot;, and &quot;Beat the Dealer&quot;.

In 2004, she appeared on the &quot;Age Swap&quot; episode of &quot;Celebrity Swap&quot; as 83-year-old Margaret Doyle, supposedly Melinda&#x27;s old ballet teacher, disguised with prosthetic make-up, a black lycra suit, a red-white wig and fake teeth.

In 2008, Messenger presented as host on programmes including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;To Buy or Not to Buy&quot;, ITV&#x27;s &quot;Bingo Night Live&quot;, and &quot;A Garden For Eden&quot; for ITV Westcountry.

She did a voiceover for a viewer competition for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Golden Balls&quot; series 3-6 between 2008 and 2009.

Messenger&#x27;s show &quot;Cowboy Builders&quot; started on Five on 8 January 2009, co-presented with Dominic Littlewood. Alongside this, Melinda was a contestant in the fourth series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, which began on 11 January 2009. She was eliminated in the seventh week after losing a surprise skate-off against Jessica Taylor. She had survived three previous skate-offs.

In 2009, Messenger, along with ex-footballer Ian Wright and &quot;The Apprentice&quot; runner-up Kate Walsh, began presenting a new show on Five called &quot;Live from Studio Five&quot;. It was announced on 29 January 2010 that Messenger was leaving her role on &quot;Live from Studio Five&quot;, to focus on other projects. Her last show was on 26 February and she was replaced by a series of guest hosts. The show was cancelled in February 2011. 

She hosted The Health Lottery Draws on ITV and Channel 5 between 2011 and 2012.

In September 2023, Channel 4 announced Messenger as one of the contestants on &quot;Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins&quot;.

===Psychotherapist===
After quitting regular television work, Messenger undertook training in psychotherapy and has practised since 2015.

==Personal life==
Having dated since they met at his local Swansea nightclub, Messenger married Wayne Roberts in Bali, Indonesia, on 26 November 1998. The couple have three children. Though Messenger expressed a desire for a large family, she decided not to have more children after suffering from post-natal depression after the births of her second and third children. In 2003, Messenger won Quality Street &quot;Celebrity Mum of the Year&quot; award.

<doc id="663426" wikidata="Q1206311" url="?curid=663426" title="Quantum logic">
<text>In the mathematical study of logic and the physical analysis of quantum foundations, quantum logic is a set of rules for manip­ulation of propositions inspired by the structure of quantum theory. The formal system takes as its starting point an obs­ervation of Garrett Birkhoff and John von Neumann, that the structure of experimental tests in classical mechanics forms a Boolean algebra, but the structure of experimental tests in quantum mechanics forms a much more complicated structure.

A number of other logics have also been proposed to analyze quantum-mechanical phenomena, unfortunately also under the name of &quot;quantum logic(s)&quot;. They are not the subject of this article. For discussion of the similarities and differences between quantum logic and some of these competitors, see &quot;&quot;.

Quantum logic has been proposed as the correct logic for propositional inference generally, most notably by the philosopher Hilary Putnam, at least at one point in his career. This thesis was an important ingredient in Putnam&#x27;s 1968 paper &quot;Is Logic Empirical?&quot; in which he analysed the epistemological status of the rules of propositional logic. Modern philosophers reject quantum logic as a basis for reasoning, because it lacks a material conditional; a common alternative is the system of linear logic, of which quantum logic is a fragment.

Mathematically, quantum logic is formulated by weakening the distributive law for a Boolean algebra, resulting in an ortho­complemented lattice. Quantum-mechanical observables and states can be defined in terms of functions on or to the lattice, giving an alternate formalism for quantum computations.

== Introduction ==
The most notable difference between quantum logic and classical logic is the failure of the propositional distributive law: 
: &quot;p&quot; and (&quot;q&quot; or &quot;r&quot;) = (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;) or (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot;),
where the symbols &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; and &quot;r&quot; are propositional variables.

To illustrate why the distributive law fails, consider a particle moving on a line and (using some system of units where the reduced Planck constant is 1) let
: &quot;p&quot; = &quot;the particle has momentum in the interval &quot; 
: &quot;q&quot; = &quot;the particle is in the interval &quot;
: &quot;r&quot; = &quot;the particle is in the interval &quot;
We might observe that:
: &quot;p&quot; and (&quot;q&quot; or &quot;r&quot;) = &quot;true&quot; 
in other words, that the state of the particle is a weighted superposition of momenta between 0 and +1/6 and positions between −1 and +3.

On the other hand, the propositions &quot;&quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; and &quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot;&quot; each assert tighter restrictions on simultaneous values of position and momentum than are allowed by the uncertainty principle (they each have uncertainty 1/3, which is less than the allowed minimum of 1/2). So there are no states that can support either proposition, and
: (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;) or (&quot;p&quot; and &quot;r&quot;) = &quot;false&quot;

== History and modern criticism ==
In his classic 1932 treatise &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;, John von Neumann noted that projections on a Hilbert space can be viewed as propositions about physical observables; that is, as potential &quot;yes-or-no questions&quot; an observer might ask about the state of a physical system, questions that could be settled by some measurement. Principles for manipulating these quantum propositions were then called &quot;quantum logic&quot; by von Neumann and Birkhoff in a 1936 paper.

George Mackey, in his 1963 book (also called &quot;Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics&quot;), attempted to axiomatize quantum logic as the structure of an ortho­complemented lattice, and recognized that a physical observable could be &quot;defined&quot; in terms of quantum propositions. Although Mackey&#x27;s presentation still assumed that the ortho­complemented lattice is the lattice of closed linear subspaces of a separable Hilbert space, Constantin Piron, Günther Ludwig and others later developed axiomatizations that do not assume an underlying Hilbert space.

Inspired by Hans Reichenbach&#x27;s then-recent defence of general relativity, the philosopher Hilary Putnam popularized Mackey&#x27;s work in two papers in 1968 and 1975, in which he attributed the idea that anomalies associated to quantum measurements originate with a failure of logic itself to his coauthor, physicist David Finkelstein. Putnam hoped to develop a possible alternative to hidden variables or wavefunction collapse in the problem of quantum measurement, but Gleason&#x27;s theorem presents severe difficulties for this goal. Later, Putnam retracted his views, albeit with much less fanfare, but the damage had been done. While Birkhoff and von Neumann&#x27;s original work only attempted to organize the calculations associated with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a school of researchers had now sprung up, either hoping that quantum logic would provide a viable hidden-variable theory, or obviate the need for one. Their work proved fruitless, and now lies in poor repute.

Most philosophers would agree that quantum logic is not a competitor to classical logic. It is far from evident (albeit true) that quantum logic is a &quot;logic&quot;, in the sense of describing a process of reasoning, as opposed to a particularly convenient language to summarize the measurements performed by quantum apparatuses. In particular, some modern philosophers of science argue that quantum logic attempts to substitute metaphysical difficulties for unsolved problems in physics, rather than properly solving the physics problems. Tim Maudlin writes that quantum &quot;logic &#x27;solves&#x27; the [measurement] problem by making the problem impossible to state.&quot;

Quantum logic remains in use among logicians and interests are expanding through the recent development of quantum computing, which has engendered a proliferation of new logics for formal analysis of quantum protocols and algorithms (see also ). The logic may also find application in (computational) linguistics.

== Algebraic structure ==
Quantum logic can be axiomatized as the theory of propositions modulo the following identities:
* &quot;a&quot; ¬¬&quot;a&quot;
* ∨ is commutative and associative.
* There is a maximal element ⊤, and ⊤ &quot;b&quot;∨¬&quot;b&quot; for any &quot;b&quot;.
* &quot;a&quot;∨¬(¬&quot;a&quot;∨&quot;b&quot;) &quot;a&quot;.

(&quot;¬&quot; is the traditional notation for &quot;not&quot;, &quot;∨&quot; the notation for &quot;or&quot;, and &quot;∧&quot; the notation for &quot;and&quot;.)

Some authors restrict to orthomodular lattices, which additionally satisfy the orthomodular law: 
* If ⊤ ¬(¬&quot;a&quot;∨¬&quot;b&quot;)∨¬(&quot;a&quot;∨&quot;b&quot;) then &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;.

(&quot;⊤&quot; is the traditional notation for truth and &quot;&quot;⊥&quot; the traditional notation for falsity.)

Alternative formulations include propositions derivable via a natural deduction, sequent calculus or tableaux system. Despite the relatively developed proof theory, quantum logic is not known to be decidable.

== Quantum logic as the logic of observables ==
The remainder of this article assumes the reader is familiar with the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. However, the main ideas can be under­stood in the finite-dimensional case.

=== Logic of classical mechanics ===
The Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics have three ingredients: states, observables and dynamics. In the simplest case of a single particle moving in R3, the state space is the position–momentum space R6. An observable is some real-valued function &quot;f&quot; on the state space. Examples of observables are position, momentum or energy of a particle. For classical systems, the value &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), that is the value of &quot;f&quot; for some particular system state &quot;x&quot;, is obtained by a process of measurement of &quot;f&quot;.

The propositions concerning a classical system are generated from basic statements of the form
: &quot;Measurement of &quot;f&quot; yields a value in the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] for some real numbers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;.&quot;

through the conventional arithmetic operations and pointwise limits. It follows easily from this characterization of propositions in classical systems that the corresponding logic is identical to the Boolean algebra of Borel subsets of the state space. They thus obey the laws of classical propositional logic (such as de Morgan&#x27;s laws) with the set operations of union and intersection corresponding to the Boolean conjunctives and subset inclusion corresponding to material implication.

In fact, a stronger claim is true: they must obey the infinitary logic .

We summarize these remarks as follows: The proposition system of a classical system is a lattice with a distinguished &quot;orthocomplementation&quot; operation: The lattice operations of &quot;meet&quot; and &quot;join&quot; are respectively set intersection and set union. The orthocomplementation operation is set complement. Moreover, this lattice is &quot;sequentially complete&quot;, in the sense that any sequence {&quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot;∈N of elements of the lattice has a least upper bound, specifically the set-theoretic union: formula_1

=== Propositional lattice of a quantum mechanical system ===
In the Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics as presented by von Neumann, a physical observable is represented by some (possibly unbounded) densely defined self-adjoint operator &quot;A&quot; on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot;. &quot;A&quot; has a spectral decomposition, which is a projection-valued measure E defined on the Borel subsets of R. In particular, for any bounded Borel function &quot;f&quot; on R, the following extension of &quot;f&quot; to operators can be made: formula_2

In case &quot;f&quot; is the indicator function of an interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], the operator &quot;f&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is a self-adjoint projection onto the subspace of generalized eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot; with eigenvalue in . That subspace can be interpreted as the quantum analogue of the classical proposition
* Measurement of &quot;A&quot; yields a value in the interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;].

This suggests the following quantum mechanical replacement for the orthocomplemented lattice of propositions in classical mechanics, essentially Mackey&#x27;s &quot;Axiom VII&quot;:
* The propositions of a quantum mechanical system correspond to the lattice of closed subspaces of &quot;H&quot;; the negation of a proposition &quot;V&quot; is the orthogonal complement &quot;V&quot;⊥.

The space &quot;Q&quot; of quantum propositions is also sequentially complete: any pairwise-disjoint sequence {&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; of elements of &quot;Q&quot; has a least upper bound. Here disjointness of &quot;W&quot;1 and &quot;W&quot;2 means &quot;W&quot;2 is a subspace of &quot;W&quot;1⊥. The least upper bound of {&quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; is the closed internal direct sum.

=== Standard semantics ===
The standard semantics of quantum logic is that quantum logic is the logic of projection operators in a separable Hilbert or pre-Hilbert space, where an observable &quot;p&quot; is associated with the set of quantum states for which &quot;p&quot; (when measured) has eigenvalue 1. From there,
* &quot;¬p&quot; is the orthogonal complement of &quot;p&quot; (since for those states, the probability of observing &quot;p&quot;, P(&quot;p&quot;) = 0),
* &quot;p&quot;∧&quot;q&quot; is the intersection of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, and
* &quot;p&quot;∨&quot;q&quot; = ¬(¬&quot;p&quot;∧¬&quot;q&quot;) refers to states that superpose &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

This semantics has the nice property that the pre-Hilbert space is complete (i.e., Hilbert) if and only if the propositions satisfy the orthomodular law, a result known as the Solèr theorem. Although much of the development of quantum logic has been motivated by the standard semantics, it is not characterized by the latter; there are additional properties satisfied by that lattice that need not hold in quantum logic.

== Differences with classical logic ==
The structure of &quot;Q&quot; immediately points to a difference with the partial order structure of a classical proposition system. In the classical case, given a proposition &quot;p&quot;, the equations
: ⊤ = &quot;p&quot;∨&quot;q&quot; and
: ⊥ = &quot;p&quot;∧&quot;q&quot;
have exactly one solution, namely the set-theoretic complement of &quot;p&quot;. In the case of the lattice of projections there are infinitely many solutions to the above equations (any closed, algebraic complement of &quot;p&quot; solves it; it need not be the orthocomplement).

More generally, propositional valuation has unusual properties in quantum logic. An orthocomplemented lattice admitting a total lattice homomorphism to must be Boolean. A standard workaround is to study maximal partial homomorphisms &quot;q&quot; with a filtering property:
: if &quot;a&quot;≤&quot;b&quot; and &quot;q&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) = ⊤, then &quot;q&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = ⊤.

=== Failure of distributivity ===
Expressions in quantum logic describe observables using a syntax that resembles classical logic. However, unlike classical logic, the distributive law &quot;a&quot; ∧ (&quot;b&quot; ∨ &quot;c&quot;) = (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) ∨ (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;c&quot;) fails when dealing with noncommuting observables, such as position and momentum. This occurs because measurement affects the system, and measurement of whether a disjunction holds does not measure which of the disjuncts is true.

For example, consider a simple one-dimensional particle with position denoted by &quot;x&quot; and momentum by &quot;p&quot;, and define observables:
* &quot;a&quot; — |&quot;p&quot;| ≤ 1 (in some units)
* &quot;b&quot; — x ≤ 0
* &quot;c&quot; — x ≥ 0

Now, position and momentum are Fourier transforms of each other, and the Fourier transform of a square-integrable nonzero function with a compact support is entire and hence does not have non-isolated zeroes. Therefore, there is no wave function that is both normalizable in momentum space and vanishes on precisely &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0. Thus, &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; and similarly &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;c&quot; are false, so (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) ∨ (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;c&quot;) is false. However, &quot;a&quot; ∧ (&quot;b&quot; ∨ &quot;c&quot;) equals &quot;a&quot;, which is certainly not false (there are states for which it is a viable measurement outcome). Moreover: if the relevant Hilbert space for the particle&#x27;s dynamics only admits momenta no greater than 1, then &quot;a&quot; is true.

To understand more, let &quot;p&quot;1 and &quot;p&quot;2 be the momentum functions (Fourier transforms) for the projections of the particle wave function to &quot;x&quot; ≤ 0 and &quot;x&quot; ≥ 0 respectively. Let |&quot;p&quot;i|↾≥1 be the restriction of &quot;p&quot;i to momenta that are (in absolute value) ≥1.

(&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot;) ∨ (&quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;c&quot;) corresponds to states with |&quot;p&quot;1|↾≥1 = |&quot;p&quot;2|↾≥1 = 0 (this holds even if we defined &quot;p&quot; differently so as to make such states possible; also, &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; corresponds to |&quot;p&quot;1|↾≥1=0 and &quot;p&quot;2=0). Meanwhile, &quot;a&quot; corresponds to states with |&quot;p&quot;|↾≥1 = 0. As an operator, &quot;p&quot; = &quot;p&quot;1 + &quot;p&quot;2, and nonzero |&quot;p&quot;1|↾≥1 and |&quot;p&quot;2|↾≥1 might interfere to produce zero |&quot;p&quot;|↾≥1. Such interference is key to the richness of quantum logic and quantum mechanics.

== Relationship to quantum measurement ==

=== Mackey observables ===
Given a orthocomplemented lattice &quot;Q&quot;, a Mackey observable φ is a countably additive homomorphism from the orthocomplemented lattice of Borel subsets of R to &quot;Q&quot;. In symbols, this means that for any sequence {&quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; of pairwise-disjoint Borel subsets of R, {φ(&quot;S&quot;&quot;i&quot;)}&quot;i&quot; are pairwise-orthogonal propositions (elements of &quot;Q&quot;) and
: formula_3

Equivalently, a Mackey observable is a projection-valued measure on R.

Theorem (Spectral theorem). If &quot;Q&quot; is the lattice of closed subspaces of Hilbert &quot;H&quot;, then there is a bijective correspondence between Mackey observables and densely-defined self-adjoint operators on &quot;H&quot;.

=== Quantum probability measures ===

A &quot;quantum probability measure&quot; is a function P defined on &quot;Q&quot; with values in [0,1] such that P(&quot;⊥)=0, P(⊤)=1 and if {&quot;E&quot;&quot;i&quot;}&quot;i&quot; is a sequence of pairwise-orthogonal elements of &quot;Q&quot; then
: formula_4

Every quantum probability measure on the closed subspaces of a Hilbert space is induced by a density matrix — a nonnegative operator of trace 1. Formally,
: Theorem. Suppose &quot;Q&quot; is the lattice of closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space of complex dimension at least 3. Then for any quantum probability measure &quot;P&quot; on &quot;Q&quot; there exists a unique trace class operator &quot;S&quot; such that formula_5 for any self-adjoint projection &quot;E&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;.

== Relationship to other logics ==
Quantum logic embeds into linear logic and the modal logic &quot;B&quot;. Indeed, modern logics for the analysis of quantum computation often begin with quantum logic, and attempt to graft desirable features of an extension of classical logic thereonto; the results then necessarily embed quantum logic.

The orthocomplemented lattice of any set of quantum propositions can be embedded into a Boolean algebra, which is then amenable to classical logic.

== Limitations ==
Although many treatments of quantum logic assume that the underlying lattice must be orthomodular, such logics cannot handle multiple interacting quantum systems. In an example due to Foulis and Randall, there are orthomodular propositions with finite-dimensional Hilbert models whose pairing admits no orthomodular model. Likewise, quantum logic with the orthomodular law falsifies the deduction theorem.

Quantum logic admits no reasonable material conditional; any connective that is monotone in a certain technical sense reduces the class of propositions to a Boolean algebra. Consequently, quantum logic struggles to represent the passage of time. One possible workaround is the theory of quantum filtrations developed in the late 1970s and 1980s by Belavkin. It is known, however, that System BV, a deep inference fragment of linear logic that is very close to quantum logic, can handle arbitrary discrete spacetimes.

<text>GeoTIFF is a public domain metadata standard which allows georeferencing information to be embedded within a TIFF file. The potential additional information includes map projection, coordinate systems, ellipsoids, datums, and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file. The GeoTIFF format is fully compliant with TIFF 6.0, so software incapable of reading and interpreting the specialized metadata will still be able to open a GeoTIFF format file.

An alternative to the &quot;inlined&quot; TIFF geospatial metadata is the *.tfw World File sidecar file format which may sit in the same folder as the regular TIFF file to provide a subset of the functionality of the standard GeoTIFF described here.

== History ==
The GeoTIFF format was originally created by Dr. Niles Ritter while he was working at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The reference implementation code was released mostly as public domain software with some parts under a permissive X license. On September 14, 2019, the Open Geospatial Consortium published the OGC GeoTIFF standard, which defines the Geographic Tag Image File Format (GeoTIFF) by specifying requirements and encoding rules for using the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) for the exchange of georeferenced or geocoded imagery. The OGC GeoTIFF 1.1 standard formalizes the existing community GeoTIFF specification version 1.0 and aligns it with the continuing addition of data to the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset.

== Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF ==

&quot;Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF&quot; (COG) is a standard based on GeoTIFF, designed to make it straightforward to use GeoTIFFs hosted on HTTP webservers, so that users and software can make use of partial data within the file without having to download the entire file. It is designed to work with HTTP range requests, and specifies a particular layout of data and metadata within the GeoTIFF, such that clients can predict which range of bytes they need to download. COG is simply a specialisation of GeoTIFF, so COG files are TIFF files.

The pattern of optimizing GeoTIFFs for HTTP range requests was first demonstrated at large scale when AWS started hosting Landsat data on Amazon S3 in 2015. The pattern was developed into the COG within the Open Source Geospatial Foundation/GDAL project, starting in around 2016. The COG format can be read and written by many common geographic software tools including GDAL, QGIS, and GeoTrellis. Various providers now supply some of their data in COG format, including USGS, NASA, Google and DigitalGlobe.

<doc id="663434" wikidata="Q6055576" url="?curid=663434" title="Internet Infidels">
<text>Internet Infidels, Inc. is an American nonprofit educational organization founded in 1995 by Jeffery Jay Lowder and Brett Lemoine. Its mission is to use the Internet to promote a view that supernatural forces or entities do not exist (metaphysical naturalism). Internet Infidels maintains a website of educational resources about agnosticism, atheism, freethought, humanism, secularism, and other nontheistic viewpoints particularly relevant to nonbelievers and skeptics of the paranormal. Relevant resources include rebuttals to arguments made by religious apologists and theistic philosophers, transcripts of debates between believers and nonbelievers, and responses from opponents of a naturalistic worldview. The site has been referred to by one of its critics, Christian apologist Gary Habermas, as &quot;one of the Internet&#x27;s main Web sites for skeptics&quot;, and by skeptical physicist Taner Edis as &quot;a major Web site serving nonbelievers&quot;. Its tagline is &quot;a drop of reason in a pool of confusion&quot;.

== Mission ==
Richard Carrier, former editor-in-chief, said that &quot;the mission of the Internet Infidels has always been to defend and promote Metaphysical Naturalism&quot;. The organization formally adopts agnostic philosopher Paul Draper&#x27;s definition of metaphysical naturalism as &quot;the hypothesis that the natural world is a closed system, which means that nothing that is not a part of the natural world affects it. ... [This] implies that there are no supernatural entities, or at least none that actually exercises its power to affect the natural world.&quot; Internet Infidels aims to inform readers that similar views have been adopted around the world and across historical eras, to make hard-to-find information more easily available, and to encourage those who profess belief to review all of the arguments and evidence and come to their own conclusions.

== Secular Web ==
The primary product of Internet Infidels is the Secular Web website, infidels.org. Its Modern Library section includes contemporary articles (1970–present) offering arguments that all religions are false (particularly Christianity, Mormonism, Islam, Judaism, and Hinduism), arguments against the existence of God, critiques of arguments for the existence of God, and arguments for metaphysical naturalism. A series of written debates between prominent theistic and nontheistic philosophers covering these issues and available in the Modern Library is titled &quot;God or Blind Nature? Philosophers Debate the Evidence&quot;.

The Secular Web also includes a section containing historical works critical of religion by Voltaire, Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Mark Twain, Bertrand Russell, and Albert Einstein.

The Secular Web Kiosk section features short, informal articles. These general interest articles include editorials, book reviews, commentary on social issues or public policy, satire, and fiction, among other things.

Bruce B. Lawrence, the Nancy and Jeffrey Marcus Humanities Professor of Religion at Duke University, described the site as &quot;hard to top&quot; for &quot;thoughtful material, extensive networking, and interdisciplinary flair.&quot;

== IIDB ==

Until 2008 Internet Infidels hosted a discussion board, IIDB (Internet Infidels Discussion Board), but during 2008 IIDB was transferred to a new site, Freethought and Rationalism Discussion Board (FRDB). Both of those sites were eventually archived as FRDB became Talk Freethought in 2014. Talk Freethought continues in the tradition of IIDB and FRDB, hosting discussions on a number of subjects including philosophy, science, politics and of course, religion.

<text>The Pointe du Raz is a promontory that extends into the Atlantic from western Brittany, in France. The local Breton name is &quot;Beg ar Raz&quot;. It is the western point of the &quot;commune&quot; of Plogoff, Finistère.

It is named after the &quot;Raz de Sein&quot;, the dangerous stretch of water between it and the island of Sein (&quot;Enez Sun&quot; in Breton). It is a dramatic place of crashing waves and strong winds. The word &quot;raz&quot; was borrowed from Norman by the Bretons and shares the same etymology as the English word race, &quot;strong current of water&quot;; both are from Old Norse &quot;rás&quot;.
It also marks the western end of the 3,200 km E5 European long distance path to Venice in Italy.

The &quot;La Vieille&quot; lighthouse can be clearly seen from the headland.

Although it is not quite the westernmost extent of continental France—that would be Pointe de Corsen, just to the north—its rocky isolation makes it a popular tourist destination, comparable in some ways to Land&#x27;s End in the southern UK.

A brief description of Pointe du Raz is part of the culminating farewell conversation between the hero and heroine of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek,&quot; symbolizing the passionate turmoil (like the winds and waves of Pointe du Raz, in the channel between France and Britain) that characterizes the relationship between the French pirate hero and the aristocratic British heroine.

On November 2, 2023, Storm Ciarán hit the area with winds reaching 207 km/h (129 mp/h).

<doc id="663444" wikidata="Q727746" url="?curid=663444" title="Dutch auction">
<text>A Dutch auction is one of several similar types of auctions for buying or selling goods. Most commonly, it means an auction in which the auctioneer begins with a high asking price in the case of selling, and lowers it until some participant accepts the price, or it reaches a predetermined reserve price. This type of price auction is most commonly used for goods that are required to be sold quickly such as flowers, fresh produce, or tobacco. A Dutch auction has also been called a &quot;clock auction&quot; or &quot;open-outcry descending-price auction&quot;. This type of auction shows the advantage of speed since a sale never requires more than one bid. It is strategically similar to a first-price sealed-bid auction.

== History ==

Herodotus relates an account of a descending price auction in Babylon, suggesting that market mechanisms similar to Dutch auctions were used in ancient times. Descending-price auctions were used in 17th-century Holland for estate sales and paintings. The Dutch manner of auctioning appeared in England by the 17th century, which was called &quot;mineing&quot;. In that type of auction, said to be a &quot;Method of Sale not hitherto used in England&quot;, the auctioneer began with a high price that was sequentially reduced until one bidder cried out &quot;Mine!&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; mentioned a Dutch auction in 1788.

== Auction process ==
Before the auction commences, the auctioneer presents information about the objects sold to bidders. This information is displayed on a clock or electronic device in front of the site.

A Dutch auction initially offers an item at a price in excess of the amount the seller expects to receive. The price lowers in steps until a bidder accepts the current price. That bidder wins the auction and pays that price for the item. For example, a business might auction a used company car at a starting bid of €15,000. If nobody accepts the initial bid, the seller successively reduces the price in €1,000 increments. When the price reaches €10,000, a particular bidder—who feels that price is acceptable and that someone else might soon bid—quickly accepts the bid, and pays €10,000 for the car.

Dutch auctions are a competitive alternative to a traditional auction, in which customers make bids of increasing value until nobody is willing to bid higher.

== Effect on stakeholders ==

=== Auctioneer&#x27;s revenue ===
The speed of the clock used in the Dutch auction has a significant effect on final prices and the auctioneer&#x27;s revenue. A fast Dutch clock has been found to yield significantly lower bids and seller revenue when benchmarked against a first-price sealed-bid auction. On the contrary, a sufficiently slow Dutch clock is found to be more profitable than a first-price auction. 

Individual differences among bidders may also influence the degree to which a Dutch auction is profitable to the auctioneer. More advanced age has a clear, statistically significant adverse impact on the overall performance in Dutch auctions. Older bidders often end up paying too much in Dutch auctions because of their cognitive limitations and high need for closure.

In the case in which two or more bidders are participating in a Dutch auction, bid reductions should be increasing. Furthermore, the auctioneer&#x27;s expected revenue should increase when the number of participants in the auction rises and number of bid levels increases.

The auctioneer is expected to increase its revenue when bidders exhibit the Allais paradox. This expectation is because bidders already have bidding preferences but insufficient time to change their preference and as such, typically act in accordance with their first plan.

=== Bidder&#x27;s emotion ===
In Dutch auctions, bidders are unable to view other participants&#x27; bids; they can only view the winning bid. This leads to participants experiencing greater uncertainty when assessing the competitive dynamics of the Dutch auction. When losing, participants experience a stronger emotional response compared to when winning. This can be attributed to the instant-win feature of Dutch auctions. The winner is aware and assured of winning the auction and paying the winning price, whilst losing comes abruptly and as a surprise for the remaining participants.

In other words, bidders in Dutch auctions are more likely to experience winner regret, the belief that they overpaid, and loser regret, the belief that they underbid, because Dutch auctions evoke a stronger emotional response than other auction formats, as bidders are unable to seek signals (such as other bids) that can inform their bidding behaviour.

== Public offerings ==
Compared to the standard book building method, Dutch auctions have been considered for public offerings and price discovery. Dutch auctions have been praised as being more efficient and fairer, as they can prevent underwriters from allocating stocks to known or favoured clients. It has been suggested that improved efficiency in the IPO market is more likely to be felt in larger, already publicly listed companies, as buyers are typically hedge funds or mutual funds. As such, the market has already priced their shares and an indication of issue size already exists.

The United States Department of the Treasury, through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY), raises funds for the U.S. government using a Dutch auction. The FRBNY interacts with primary dealers, including large banks and broker-dealers, who submit bids on behalf of themselves and their clients using the Trading Room Automated Processing System (TRAPS) and are generally informed of winning bids within fifteen minutes.

For example, suppose the sponsor of the issuance seeks to raise $10 billion in ten-year notes with a 5.125% coupon. Bids are filled from the lowest yield/highest price until the entire $10 billion is raised -- however, all filled bids receive the lowest &quot;cleared&quot; price, even those who bid a higher price (encouraging higher priced bids). In aggregate the bids are as follows:

*$1.00 billion at 5.115% (highest bid, lowest coupon)
*$2.50 billion at 5.120%
*$3.50 billion at 5.125%
*$4.50 billion at 5.130%
*$3.75 billion at 5.135%
*$2.75 billion at 5.140%
*$1.50 billion at 5.145% (lowest bid, highest coupon)

In this example, $10.00 billion is raised by the bids at and above the price of 5.130% yield; the auction &quot;clears&quot; at 5.130% yield. All filled bids thus receive this price. All higher-priced bids are first filled ($7.00 billion), leaving enough bonds ($3.00 billion) to fill 2/3rds of the bids at the clearing price; the other 1/3rd, and all lower price bids, are unfilled. In theory, this feature of the Dutch auction leads to more aggressive bidding, as those who (in this example) bid 5.115% receive the bonds at the lower price/higher yield of 5.130%.

A variation on the Dutch auction, OpenIPO, was developed by Bill Hambrecht and has been used for a number of US IPOs. Auctions have been used for hundreds of IPOs in more than two dozen countries but have not been popular with issuers and thus were replaced by other methods. One of the largest uniform price or &quot;Dutch&quot; auction IPOs was for Singapore Telecom in 1994. The 1994 auction IPO of Japan Tobacco was substantially larger, with proceeds more than doubling those of the Singapore Telecom IPO and tripling those of the Google IPO, but this auction was discriminatory or pay-what-you-bid, not uniform price or Dutch. SRECTrade.com uses a two-sided Dutch auction to trade Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs).

Dutch auction IPOs have been criticised for the possibility of tacit collusion and cartel-like behaviour, as the issuer has discretion over price and allocation. This possibility is more prevalent in primary market transactions.

== Dutch auction share repurchases ==
The introduction of the Dutch auction share repurchase in 1981 gives firms an alternative to the fixed price tender offer when executing a tender offer share repurchase. The first firm to use the Dutch auction was Todd Shipyards. A Dutch auction offer specifies a price range within which the shares are purchased. Shareholders can choose to tender their stock at any price within the stated range. The firm compiles these responses, creating a supply curve for the stock. The purchase price is the lowest price that allows the firm to buy the number of shares sought in the offer, and the firm pays that price to all investors who tendered at or below that price. If the number of shares tendered exceeds the number sought, the company purchases less than all shares tendered at or below the purchase price pro rata to all who tendered at or below the purchase price. If too few shares are tendered, then the firm either cancels the offer (provided it had been made conditional on a minimum acceptance), or it buys back all tendered shares at the maximum price.

== eBay ascending uniform-price mechanism ==
Rather than implementing a traditional Dutch auction, internet auction and e-commerce site eBay formerly (until 2009) offered a multi-quantity listing style. This allowed a person to bid by specifying a price and quantity collectively. This Dutch auction mechanism has been referred to as ascending uniform-price &quot;Dutch&quot; auction.

The units were sold per the price and quantity bidden that added up to the highest overall value. Each individual bidder paid the price of the bidder with the lowest winning price. However, they all were guaranteed the quantity they demanded in their original bid. This has been criticised in literature as not being a Dutch auction, because Dutch auctions guarantee not the price but rather the quantity demanded by a bidder.

==Slow Dutch auction==
Dutch flower auctions are considered to be a particularly fast auction form with particularly low transaction costs, and they use an electronic device to lower the price. Sometimes, slower processes such as the bargain basement of Filene&#x27;s Department Store in the USA, during which the discount on goods was increased over time until the goods were sold, are considered Dutch auctions.
When faced with a positive cost of returning to the auction site, buyers prefer to purchase the object sooner (at a higher price) to economize on the cost of return. Therefore, when transaction costs are accounted for, Dutch auctions yield, on average, higher revenue than sealed-bid auctions. Holding electronic auctions reduces transaction costs substantially by relaxing physical and temporal constraints. In many cases, electronic markets enable competition in markets where competition was not possible before.

==Dutch auction format==

Dutch auctions are all sellers&#x27; bidding auctions, also known as silent auctions, which can be divided into two types.

* Manual silent auction is an early traditional form of price reduction auction, in which the auctioneer first publicly quotes the highest price, and then the bidders respond accordingly. In the event of a price that no one bids for, the auctioneer will decrease the price and quote a new price, and decrease the price one by one, and the process will continue until someone buys it; if there are more than two bids, the auctioneer should quote a new price in increments.

* Dial-type silent auction was also invented by the Dutch and is a modern form of reduced-price auction. That is to say, the auctioneer first announces the highest price in public, which is displayed on the corresponding scale on the electronic auction clock, and then the bidder presses the button to bid one by one. Indicates a decrementing price reduction until someone pushes a button to stall it for a purchase. When there are more than two bids, the hands of the auction clock will rotate clockwise, indicating that the price will be increased until the last person left to stop. Here, the electronic auction bell replaces the wooden auction hammer as the transaction tool.

== Hybrid Dutch auction ==
The hybrid dutch auction is a new form of dutch auction that uses two methods that is the traditional dutch auction and sealed bid uniform price auction. Compared to the traditional dutch auction method, hybrid dutch auction comprises several stages consisting of:

* In the first stage, namely the classic dutch auction, the item&#x27;s value continues to decrease gradually by 1%. If it has reached the minimum threshold price and no bidders putting offers, the first stage is declared complete. 

* The second stage is a sealed bid uniform price auction. The winner of the first stage has the option to no longer participate in the second stage of the auction. In addition, the winner&#x27;s price in the first stage is used as a minimum price and bidders bid privately, where bidders do not know the prices each other is bidding on. The second stage winner is taken from the bidder with the highest bidding price. 

* In the final stage, the winner of the first stage auction may bid again at 10% higher than the second stage winner. If the first stage auction winner is willing to do this, he is the winner of hybrid dutch auction. But, if he cannot do this, the second stage winner is the winner of hybrid dutch auction. 

The purpose of establishing the hybrid dutch auction is to overcome problems in the traditional dutch auction, which can lead to collusion and excessive payment. Auctioneer initially setting the highest price, and the bidders must bid lower the initial price until both the auctioneer and bidder reach an agreement. Collusion happens because bidders are able to collude in determining the price. Hybrid dutch auction reduces the probability of collusion and cartel by providing a minimum price limit, and the winner is drawn from the highest price bidder. In addition, in second stage auction, where the first stage winner has the ability to not take part in the second stage auction, he is able to increase his bid in the last stage. This action can increase the seller&#x27;s profit. A hybrid dutch auction is also able to maintain the stability of the item price and gives benefit to both auctioneers and bidders.

<text>Arryx, Inc. was a company that developed tools and technology for manipulation and measurement on the micro and nano length scales. Arryx&#x27;s technology and products centered around optical trapping. They specialized in holographic optical trapping, a technique for creating and moving many optical traps at once. Their technology was commercialized in the form of a flagship research tool, the BioRyx 200 optical trapping system. Arryx has investigated the application of the technique to an array of problems in different fields including telecommunications, agriculture, healthcare, basic research, and forensics.

Arryx was founded in the fall of 2000, based on technology invented at the University of Chicago by Professor David G. Grier and his student Eric R. Dufresne a couple years earlier. Their BioRyx 200 system was released in early 2002 and won an R&amp;D 100 Award later that year. An IR version of the system was released in 2004 for broader application to biological systems, with support of additional imaging methods including fluorescent microscopy.

In July 2006, Arryx was acquired by Haemonetics, with whom they had an ongoing partnership. On April 30, 2013, Arryx ceased operations, although Haemonetics pledges to continue to support the service agreements for Arryx products.

<text>The black drop effect is an optical phenomenon visible during a transit of Venus and, to a lesser extent, a transit of Mercury.

==Description==
Just after second contact, and again just before third contact during the transit, a small black &quot;teardrop&quot; appears to connect Venus&#x27;s disc to the of the Sun, making it impossible to time the exact moment of second or third contact accurately. This led to the failure of the attempts during the 18th century transits of Venus to establish a truly precise value for the astronomical unit.

The black drop effect was long thought to be due to Venus&#x27;s thick atmosphere, and indeed it was held to be the first real evidence that Venus had an atmosphere. However, it is now thought by many to be an optical effect caused by the combination of the extreme darkening of the Sun&#x27;s disk near its apparent edge and the intrinsic imperfection of the viewing apparatus.

Observing Mercury simultaneously during its transit in May 1832 with different instruments, Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel and Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander noticed a black drop effect (though the term had not been coined yet) with that instrument of less resolution. With precise measurements, a black drop effect was observed from outside the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the 1999 and 2003 transits of Mercury, although Mercury has no significant atmosphere.

 transit of Venus, many observers reported that they did not see the black drop effect, or at least that it was much less pronounced than had been reported in earlier centuries&#x27; transits. Larger telescopes, better optics, and limb darkening may have been factors.

==1832 Mercury transit==
The Shuckburgh telescope of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in London was used for the 1832 transit of Mercury. It was equipped with a micrometer by Dollond and was used for a report of the events as seen through the small refractor. By observing the transit in combination with timing it and taking measures, a diameter for the planet was taken. They also reported the peculiar effects that they compared to pressing a coin into the Sun. The observer remarked:
