<text>Vision Quest (released in the United Kingdom and Australia as Crazy for You) is a 1985 American coming-of-age romantic drama/sports film starring Matthew Modine, Michael Schoeffling, Ronny Cox and Linda Fiorentino in her first film role. It is based on Terry Davis&#x27;s 1979 novel of the same name.

Modine plays a Spokane high school wrestler who falls in love with an older woman, an aspiring artist from Trenton, New Jersey, on her way to San Francisco.

The film includes the first major motion picture appearance by Madonna, who plays a singer at a local bar, where she performs the songs &quot;Crazy for You&quot; and &quot;Gambler&quot;. In some countries, the title of the film was changed to &quot;Crazy for You&quot; to capitalize on Madonna&#x27;s emerging fame and the popularity of her song of that name. The film has become a cult classic.

== Plot ==
Louden Swain is a wrestler at Thompson High School who has just turned 18 years old. He has decided that he needs to do something truly meaningful in his life. He embarks on a mission or, in a Native American term, a &quot;vision quest&quot;. His goal is to drop two weight classes to challenge the area&#x27;s toughest opponent, Brian Shute, a menacing three-time state champion from nearby rival Hoover High School, who has never been defeated in his high school career. In his zeal to drop from to , against the wishes of his coach and teammates, he disrupts the team around him and creates health problems of his own.

Meanwhile, his father has taken on a boarder named Carla from Trenton, New Jersey, who is passing through on her way to San Francisco. Louden falls in love with her and begins to lose sight of his goals as a wrestler. Worse, his drastic weight loss culminates in an unhealthy situation, where he gets frequent nosebleeds which, Louden assumes, is due to a lack of iron in his diet (and results in him having to forfeit a match he was winning). The two finally admit their love for each other, but Carla realizes she is distracting him from his goals.

Carla decides to move out and continue on to San Francisco, but not before seeing Louden&#x27;s big match, in which he makes a comeback from losing and pins Shute in the final seconds with an O-Goshi (over-under hip toss).

As Louden celebrates his victory, he monologues to the audience &quot;...I guess that&#x27;s why we got to love those people who deserve it like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. &#x27;Cause when you get right down to it—there isn&#x27;t.&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
Production took place in Spokane, Washington, in the fall of 1983. The film was shot at Rogers High School in northeast Spokane, referred to as &quot;Thompson High School&quot; in the film. Interior cafeteria scenes were filmed at Ferris High School on Spokane&#x27;s South Hill. Some of the locker room scenes were filmed in the boys&#x27; locker room of Shadle Park High School in northwest Spokane. Madonna&#x27;s scene was filmed at the Big Foot Tavern on North Division Street in Spokane. Other scenes were shot at The Onion Restaurant downtown and the North Central High School gym. The scene where Louden&#x27;s big match happens was shot in the gym at Spokane Falls Community College.

==Reception==
The film had moderate success in theaters in the U.S. in 1985, earning a gross of $13 million. It has received a rating of 63% at Rotten Tomatoes from 16 reviews, and has gone on to become a cult classic.

Roger Ebert of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3.5 stars out of a possible 4, saying while the core storyline was a formulaic sports drama &quot;it is nevertheless a movie with some nice surprises, mostly because it takes the time to create some interesting characters&quot;, with standout performances from Modine, Cox, and Fiorentino.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack to the motion picture was released by Geffen Records on February 12, 1985. The soundtrack does not include &quot;No More Words&quot; by Berlin or tracks from REO Speedwagon and Quarterflash, which appear in the film. The background instrumental music by Tangerine Dream is not included, but was later released on the fan project &quot;Tangerine Tree 73: Soundtrax&quot;.

===Reception===
The soundtrack received generally positive feedback from music journalists. &quot;Singapore Monitor&quot; called the album a &quot;very timely collection by some of the bigger up-and-coming names in today&#x27;s pop and rock scene&quot;. Similarly, Rick Shefchik, in his review for Knight Ridder, named the release as &quot;the best soundtrack album in the racks these days&quot;. Brian Chin from &quot;Billboard&quot; complimented Madonna&#x27;s songs on the soundtrack. The album charted in Australia, Canada, and the United States. Upon release, Jeff Bunch from &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; named it one of the &quot;best examples of profitable soundtracks&quot; of unsuccessful movies. The home video release also peaked at number five on &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s Top 40 Videocassettes. &quot;Vision Quest&quot; ended as one of the Top 50 Albums and Top Soundtracks on &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s Pop Album Awards. The album was included among Yardbarker&#x27;s list of the 25 Best Soundtracks From the 1980s. In 2024, the soundtrack was included in &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of the 101 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time.

===Impact===
The movie was renamed &quot;Crazy for You&quot; in New Zealand, Australia and the UK, by a still-on-the-rise singer Madonna and her song &quot;Crazy for You&quot;. &quot;Cashbox&quot;″s Julius Robinson retrospectively commented in 1988, that the song &quot;really put [her] on the map&quot;.

Writing for &quot;Cashbox&quot; in 1985, Peter Berk explained the film &quot;offered a valuable lesson to the industry&quot;, showing &quot;how much a hit song can do to promote an otherwise soon-to-be forgotten movie&quot;. He continued, writing that, although Journey&#x27;s &quot;Only The Young&quot; drew attention to the album, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Crazy for You&quot; made the soundtrack &quot;so magnetic to record buyers&quot;. He complimented that films like &quot;Vision Quest&quot; have &quot;made many people aware of just how invaluable the film-music connection is today&quot;. In December 1987, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine dedicated an article to the links between a movie and a hit single and music videos. In July 1985, Jan DeKnock from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; noted what he called a &quot;movie mania&quot;, when various singles from motion pictures reached the first spot in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that year, beginning with &quot;Crazy for You&quot;. It was the first song produced by John Benitez to climb to the U.S. charts, breaking the nine-week steak of &quot;We Are the World&quot;. Australian music editor Marc Andrews, in &quot;Madonna Song by Song&quot; (2022), wrote that &quot;Crazy for You&quot; is now &quot;considered one of the greatest, if not sexiest, love songs of all time&quot;. Len Comaratta, from &quot;Consequence&quot;, called it &quot;a classic in the rock ballad canon&quot;. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Crazy for You&quot; is one of all-time biggest movie songs on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; picked it as one of the Best 10 Madonna songs From movie soundtracks.

<doc id="678603" wikidata="Q4248801" url="?curid=678603" title="Gross Anatomy (film)">
<text>Gross Anatomy is a 1989 American medical comedy-drama film directed by Thom Eberhardt from a screenplay by Ron Nyswaner and Mark Spragg. The film stars Matthew Modine, Daphne Zuniga, and Christine Lahti.

&quot;Gross Anatomy&quot; was released in the United States by Touchstone Pictures on October 20, 1989.

==Plot==
Joe Slovak is a brilliant freshman medical school student whose nonconformist approach to life is tested when he enrolls in gross anatomy, the toughest course in med school. His schoolfriends and lab partners include Kim, a pregnant woman; Miles, a buttoned-down blue-blood; Laurie, an overly ambitious student determined to make it; and David, an overanalyzer who is also his roommate.

Joe&#x27;s freewheeling, independent style immediately causes problems in the classroom, beginning with his constantly arriving late to class and using a door marked as &quot;Do not enter&quot;, all of which annoy the class instructor Dr. Banumbra. Joe&#x27;s antics become more serious, and put him at odds with the demanding department head, Dr. Woodruff, after Joe jokes about a cadaver in a disrespectful manner, prompting Woodruff to remind him that the bodies in the gross anatomy course were real people who donated their bodies to science and deserve respect. After Joe allows his roommate David to glance at his answers on an examination, Woodruff questions whether her easygoing &quot;class rebel&quot; has what it takes to be a doctor.

Meanwhile, Joe falls in love with his lab partner Laurie, who won&#x27;t let anything, especially romance, interfere with her plans. While Joe&#x27;s never done anything by the book, he proves he does have what it takes to succeed — without changing his ways. However, Joe&#x27;s ways and the ways of medicine come to a head twice, once when he discovers David has been taking amphetamines, which leads to his expulsion when he passes out in class and Joe reveals this to Dr. Woodruff. The other time is when Joe is ordered to do an extra credit assignment by Dr. Woodruff involving a complex diagnosis. Joe correctly diagnoses it as a serious, difficult-to-treat chronic illness and learns the patient is Dr. Woodruff herself.

Joe returns to class and his teammates help him get caught up with his studies. Kim goes into labor when the group is on the road, forcing them to deliver the baby in a truck stop. Joe takes the final exam, then is told that Dr. Woodruff died that morning. This renews Joe&#x27;s dedication to learning medicine and he takes his studies and his future more seriously. He and Laurie successfully pass their first year of medical school and Kim vows to return. Although Miles ends up with lower grades than Laurie and Joe, he has also passed.

===NATO commander===
From 1968 until his retirement from the Navy in 1972, Admiral Rivero was the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&#x27;s commander in chief of the Allied Forces in Southern Europe. He was responsible of the land, sea and air forces of five nations deployed in the Mediterranean area: Italy, Greece, Turkey, Britain and the United States. During his years as commander, some 215,000 of the 310,000 American troops in Europe were stationed in West Germany. At the time, Rivero believed that any withdrawal of United States troops from West Germany might affect the strength of the United States Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.

==Post-Navy career==
From 1972 to 1975, Admiral Rivero served as the U.S. Ambassador to Spain under the administration of President Richard M. Nixon from 1972 to 1974. Rivero was also the Honorary Chairman of the American Veterans&#x27; Committee for Puerto Rico Self-Determination.

Rivero died on September 24, 2000, and was buried with full military honors in the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery of San Diego, California. He was survived by a daughter, two grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and two sisters, both of Puerto Rico. On November 11, 2008, the government of Puerto Rico unveiled in the Capitol Rotunda the oil portrait of Admiral Horacio Rivero Jr.

==Awards and recognitions==
Among Admiral Rivero&#x27;s decorations and medals were the following:


On April 1, 2017, the United States Navy Reserve dedicated posthumously the Navy Operational Support Center NOSC building in Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico, to Admiral Horacio Rivero Jr.

In 2017 Horacio Rivero Jr. was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<doc id="678622" wikidata="Q7917624" url="?curid=678622" title="Vazhuvoor (Dance)">
<text>Vazhuvoor (or Vizhuvur) is one of the original styles of Bharatanatyam, a major form of Indian classical dance.

The main distinctive features include:

*rich &quot;sringar&quot; elements
*wide range of dancing pace
*softer facial &quot;abhinaya&quot;
*extremely elaborate movements
*deep sitting positions
*variety of positions on the floor

In the older, Pandanallur style &quot;pani&quot;, &quot;abhinaya&quot; is more ritualistic (i.e. in conformity with the rules as set by the ancient texts) than realistic, so the spectators are supposed know the rules to appreciate it. The Vazhuvur &quot;pani&quot; evolved later than the Pandanallur, and while this did not deviate from the rules of the performing arts treatise &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, it adopted the &quot;abhinayas&quot; that were relatively more realistic. However, some contemporary Bharatanatyam dancers, such as seen in the external link below, have created several transitional sub-styles. This style of Bharatanatyam was made famous and was introduced by Vazhuvoor B. Ramiah Pillai and his ancestors.

==More distinct characteristics==

*performance begins with a &quot;Thodaya mangalam&quot; in praise of Lord Gnana Sabesar of Vazhuvoor
*the dancer starts the performance while entering the stage from the wings
*static postures are performed, most often in the &quot;tillana&quot;, to break the monotony and to add the variety of rhythms 
*the &quot;jatis,&quot; or distinct segments of choreography&quot;,&quot; have more &quot;korvais&quot; (intervals), which creates a suspense effect
*the dancer&#x27;s torso from the waist up is slightly bent forward
*the &quot;adavus&quot; flow smoothly, with rare abrupt movements 
*beautiful leaps are introduced into every &quot;jati&quot;
*&quot;abhinaya&quot; is subtle with more &quot;natyadharmi&quot; (spontaneous expressions), so the presentation is not &quot;overdone&quot;
*&quot;lasya&quot; dominates &quot;tandava&quot;

<text>Live is a live album by the American rock band Alice in Chains. It was released on December 5, 2000, through Columbia Records. The live version of &quot;Man in the Box&quot; featured in the album was released as a single.

==Overview==
&quot;Live&quot; was the band&#x27;s only live album other than the acoustic album &quot;Unplugged&quot;. While most of the songs on &quot;Live&quot; had been released on previous albums, &quot;Queen of the Rodeo&quot; had not; although, the same live performance had been released on the &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set. &quot;Live&quot; includes five songs (&quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;God Am&quot;, &quot;Again&quot;, &quot;A Little Bitter&quot; and &quot;Dam That River&quot;) from the band&#x27;s final two shows with vocalist Layne Staley.

==Reception==
The album received generally positive reviews from most critics, with Greg Prato of AllMusic writing in his review of the album &quot;Their detuned sound and tales from the darkside are even more sinister and gripping on the concert stage, as evidenced by this 14-track set.&quot;

<doc id="678671" wikidata="Q993" url="?curid=678671" title="Kamchatka Peninsula">
<text>The Kamchatka Peninsula (, ) is a peninsula in the Russian Far East, with an area of about . The Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk make up the peninsula&#x27;s eastern and western coastlines, respectively. Immediately offshore along the Pacific coast of the peninsula runs the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench.

The Kamchatka Peninsula, the Commander Islands, and Karaginsky Island constitute Kamchatka Krai of the Russian Federation. The majority of the 322,079 inhabitants are ethnic Russians, with about 13,000 being Koryaks (2014). More than half of the population lives in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (179,526 in 2010) and nearby Yelizovo (38,980). The Kamchatka Peninsula contains the volcanoes of Kamchatka, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Geography==

Politically, the peninsula forms part of Kamchatka Krai. The southern tip is called Cape Lopatka. (Lopatka is Russian for spade.) The circular bay to the north of this on the Pacific side is Avacha Bay, home to the capital, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Northward up the Pacific side, the four peninsulas are called Shipunsky Point, Kronotsky Point, Kamchatsky Point, and Ozernoy Point. North of Ozernoy Point is the large Karaginsky Bay, which features Karaginsky Island. Northeast of this (off the displayed map) lies Korfa Bay with the town of Tilichiki. On the opposite side is the Shelikhov Gulf.

The Kamchatka or Central (Sredinny) Range forms the spine of the peninsula. Along the southeast coast runs the Eastern Range &quot;(Vostochny)&quot;. Between these lies the central valley. The Kamchatka River rises northwest of Avacha and flows north down the central valley, turning east near Klyuchi to enter the Pacific south of Kamchatsky Point at Ust-Kamchatsk. 

In the 19th century, a trail led west from near Klychi over the mountains to the Tegil river and town, which was the main trading post on the west coast. North of Tegil is Koryak Okrug. South of the Tegil is the Icha River. Just south of the headwaters of the Kamchatka, the Bistraya River curves southwest to enter the Sea of Okhotsk at Bolsheretsk, which once served as a port connecting the peninsula to Okhotsk. South of the Bistraya flows the Golygina River.

Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and the settlements in the central part of the peninsula are connected by highway to Ust-Kamchatsk. The road is asphalt in its southern part, but changes to gravel about halfway north where the population is sparser. Another highway connects the local capital with Bolsheretsk. Bus service is available on both roads. Most other roads are gravel-covered or dirt roads, requiring off-road-capable vehicles. There is semi-regular passenger transportation with aircraft.

The obvious circular area in the central valley is the Klyuchevskaya Sopka, an isolated volcanic group southeast of the curve of the Kamchatka River. West of Kronotsky Point is the Kronotsky Biosphere Reserve with the Valley of Geysers. At the southern tip is the Southern Kamchatka Wildlife Refuge with Kurile Lake. There are several other protected areas on the peninsula.

===Climate===
Kamchatka receives up to of precipitation per year. This is much higher than the rest of Eastern Russia, and is due to prevailing westerly winds blowing over the Sea of Japan and picking up moisture that rises as it hits the higher topography of the peninsula, and condenses into rain. The summers are moderately cool, and the winters are rather stormy, but the storms rarely produce lightning.
Although Kamchatka lies at latitudes similar to Scotland&#x27;s, cold arctic winds from Siberia combined with the cold Oyashio sea current keep the peninsula covered in snow from October to late May. Under the Köppen climate classification, Kamchatka generally has a subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;), but higher and more northerly areas have a polar climate (&quot;ET&quot;). Kamchatka is much wetter and milder than eastern Siberia. It is essentially transitional from the hypercontinental climate of Siberia and northeast China to the rain-drenched subpolar oceanic climate of the Aleutian Islands.

There is considerable variation, however, between the rain-drenched and heavily glaciated east coast and the drier and more continental interior valley. In the heavily glaciated Kronotsky Peninsula, where maritime influences are most pronounced, annual precipitation can reach as high as , whilst the southeast coast south of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky generally receives around of rainfall equivalent per year. Considerable local variations exist: southern parts of the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky metropolitan area can receive as much as more than the northern part of the city. Temperatures here are very mild, with summer maxima around and winter lows around , whilst diurnal temperature ranges seldom exceed due to persistent fog on exposed parts of the coast. South of 57° ˚N, there is no permafrost due to the relatively mild winters and heavy snow cover, whilst northward, discontinuous permafrost prevails. The west coastal plain has a colder and drier climate with precipitation ranging from in the south to as little as in the north, where winter temperatures become considerably colder at around .

The interior valley of the Kamchatka River, represented by Klyuchi, has much lower precipitation (at around ) and significantly more continental temperatures, reaching on a typical summer day and during extreme cold winter spells falling as low as . Sporadic permafrost prevails over the lower part of this valley, but it becomes more widespread at higher altitudes and glaciers, and continuous permafrost prevails north of 55˚° N.

The summer months, when maximum temperatures range from , are popular with tourists, but a growing trend in winter sports keeps tourism pulsing year-round. The volcanoes and glaciers play a role in forming Kamchatka&#x27;s climate, and hot springs have kept alive dozens of species decimated during the last ice age.

===Geology, earthquakes and volcanoes===

The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes, 29 of them still active. The peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena, with 19 active volcanoes included in the six UNESCO World Heritage List sites in the Volcanoes of Kamchatka group, most of them on the Kamchatka Peninsula, the most volcanic area of the Eurasian continent, with many active cones. The Kamchatka Peninsula is also known as the &quot;land of fire and ice&quot;.

The highest volcano is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (), the largest active volcano in the Northern Hemisphere. Many have highly symmetrical cones, and Kronotsky is viewed by volcanologists Robert and Barbara Decker as a prime candidate for the world&#x27;s most beautiful volcano. Somewhat more accessible are the three volcanoes visible from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky: Koryaksky, Avachinsky, and Kozelsky. In the center of Kamchatka is the Valley of Geysers, which was partly destroyed by a massive mudslide in June 2007.

Owing to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, deep-focus seismic events and tsunamis occur fairly commonly. A pair of megathrust earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16, 1737, and on November 4, 1952, with magnitudes of ≈9.3 and 8.2 respectively. A chain of more shallow earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006. A significant 7.7-magnitude earthquake with a shallow depth of occurred in the Pacific Ocean, east-southeast of Nikolskoye, on July 18, 2017.

==History and exploration==
Prior to Russian discovery, the peninsula was inhabited by various Chukotko-Kamchatkan peoples (specifically the Itelmen, Koryak, and Alyutor). The southern tip of the peninsula was also the northernmost extent of Ainu settlement.

When the Russian explorer Ivan Moskvitin reached the Sea of Okhotsk in 1639, further exploration was impeded by the lack of skills and equipment to build seagoing ships and by the harsh land to the northeast inhabited by the warlike Koryak people. Consequently, Russians entered Kamchatka from the north. In 1651, after having assisted in the foundation of the Anadyrsk &quot;ostrog&quot;, the explorer Mikhail Stadukhin went south and followed the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk from Penzhina Bay to Okhotsk. From about 1667 there were reports of a Kamchatka River to the south. Some time before 1700 a group of Russians were stranded and died on Kamchatka.

In 1695, explorer Vladimir Atlasov became commander of Anadyrsk. In 1696 he sent the Cossack Luka Morozko south. Morozko got as far as the Tigil River and returned with reports and some mysterious writings, probably Japanese. In 1697–1699, Atlasov explored nearly the whole of the peninsula. He built an &quot;ostrog&quot; at Verkhny-Kamchatsk, rescued or captured a Japanese castaway, and went to Moscow to report. In 1699, the Russians at Verkhny-Kamchatsk were killed on their way back to Anadyrsk by the Koryaks. In 1700, a punitive expedition destroyed a Koryak village and founded Nizhne-Kamchatsk on the lower river. Bolskeretsk was founded in 1703. From about 1705, there was a breakdown of order. There were numerous mutinies and native wars all over the peninsula and north to the Koryak country of the Penzhina River and Olyutor Gulf. Several people were sent out to restore order, including Atlasov, who was murdered by mutineers in 1711. Vasily Merlin restored some degree of order between 1733 and 1739. There was no significant resistance after 1756. A major smallpox epidemic that hit in 1768–1769 quickly decimated the native population; the roughly 2,500 Itelmens present in 1773 were reduced to 1,900 in 1820, from an original population of 12,000–25,000. Those who survived adopted Russian customs, and there was a great deal of intermarriage, such that &quot;Kamchadal&quot; (the original Russian name for the Itelmens) came to mean any Russian or part-Russian born on the peninsula.

In 1713, Peter the Great sent shipbuilders to Okhotsk. A fifty-four-foot boat was built and sailed to the Tegil River in June 1716. This one-week journey, later redirected to Okhotsk-Bolseretsk, became the standard route to Kamchatka. In 1720, Ivan Yevreinov mapped Kamchatka and the Kurils. The Danish-born Russian explorer Vitus Bering left Nezhe-Kamchatsk for his first voyage in 1728 and, as part of his second voyage, founded Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in 1740.

Vitus Bering&#x27;s Second Kamchatka Expedition (ca 1733–1743), in the service of the Russian Navy, began the final &quot;opening&quot; of Kamchatka, helped by the fact that the government began to use the area to exile people, famously the Hungarian nobleman and explorer the Count de Benyovszky in 1770. In 1755, Stepan Krasheninnikov published the first detailed description of the peninsula, &quot;An Account of the Land of Kamchatka&quot;. The Russian government encouraged the commercial activities of the Russian-American Company by granting land to newcomers on the peninsula. By 1812, the indigenous population had fallen to less than 3,200 while the Russian population had risen to 2,500.

In 1854, the French and British, who were battling Russian forces in the course of the Crimean War, attacked Petropavlovsk. During the Siege of Petropavlovsk, 988 men with a mere 68 guns managed to defend the outpost against 6 ships with 206 guns and 2,540 French and British soldiers. Despite the successful defense, the Russians abandoned Petropavlovsk as a strategic liability after the French and British forces withdrew. The next year, when a second enemy force came to attack the port, they found it deserted. Frustrated, the ships bombarded the city and withdrew.

On 24 May 1861, the ship &quot;Polar Star&quot; (475 tons), of New Bedford, wrecked on the west coast of Kamchatka during a dense fog and gale. The chief officer and a boat&#x27;s crew perished while attempting to reach the shore. The rest of the crew were saved by the barque &quot;Alice&quot;, of Cold Spring, and the ship &quot;Oliver Crocker&quot;, also from New Bedford.

On 21 May 1865, the American Civil War came to the area: the Confederate States Navy steamer &quot;Shenandoah&quot; sailed past the southern end of the Kamchatka Peninsula on its way to hunt United States whaling ships in the Sea of Okhotsk. As a commerce raider, the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; aimed to destroy Union merchant shipping and thus draw off United States Navy ships in pursuit, thereby loosening the US Navy blockade of Confederate coasts. The ship spent almost three weeks in the Sea, destroying only one ship due to the dangerous ice, before moving on to the North Pacific, where it virtually captured or bonded 24 whalers, sinking most of them.

The next fifty years were lean for Kamchatka. The naval port moved to Ust-Amur, and in 1867, Russia sold Alaska to the United States, making Petropavlovsk obsolete as a transit point for traders and explorers on their way to the American territories. In 1860, a &quot;Primorsky&quot; (Maritime) &quot;Region&quot; was established and Kamchatka was placed under its jurisdiction. In 1875, Russia ceded the Kuril Islands to Japan in return for Russian sovereignty over Sakhalin island. The Russian population of Kamchatka stayed at around 2,500 until the turn of the century, while the native population increased to 5,000. During the 19th century, scientific exploration of the peninsula continued. Karl von Ditmar made an important journey to the peninsula in 1851–1854.

In 1920, Russian leader Vladimir Lenin offered a 60-year lease of the peninsula to the United States.

World War II (1939–1945) hardly affected Kamchatka except for its role as a launch site for the invasion of Manchuria in August 1945. After the war, the Soviet authorities declared Kamchatka a military zone. Vilyuchinsk, located on the Kamchatka Peninsula about 20 kilometers (12 mi) across Avacha Bay from Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, was founded as Sovetsky in 1968 through the amalgamation of three earlier settlements which supplied the Soviet Navy as a submarine constructor; it is the home base of the Russian Pacific fleet. The Kura Missile Test Range, an intercontinental ballistic missile impact area located northeast of the settlement of Klyuchi, was developed beginning in 1955. Kamchatka remained closed to Soviet citizens until 1989 and to foreigners until 1990.

From 1946 to 1949, around 50,000 North Korean people went to Kamchatka as contract workers. Several thousand refused to repatriate after the end of their contract, which has led to a community of around 1,800 by 2020.

Avacha Bay was the scene of massive die-off of benthic marine organisms in September–October 2020. 

==Fauna and flora==

Kamchatka boasts abundant flora. The variable climate promotes different flora zones where tundra and muskeg are dominant, succeeded by grasses, flowering shrubs, and forests of pine, birch, alder, and willow. The wide variety of plant forms spread throughout the Peninsula promotes a similar diversity in animal species that feed off the flora. Although Kamchatka is mostly tundra, deciduous and coniferous trees are abundant, and forests can be found throughout the peninsula.

Kamchatka has diverse and abundant wildlife. This is due to many factors, including a wide range of climates; diverse topography and geography; many free-flowing rivers; proximity to the highly productive waters of the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the Bering, and the Okhotsk Seas; low human population density; and minimal development. The peninsula also boasts the southernmost expanse of Arctic tundra in the world. However, commercial exploitation of marine resources and a history of fur trapping has taken its toll on several species.

Kamchatka is famous for the abundance and size of its brown bears. In the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, there are estimated to be three to four bears per . Other fauna of note include carnivores such as tundra wolf (&quot;Canis lupus albus&quot;), Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;), Anadyr fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes beringiana&quot;), East Siberian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx wrangeli&quot;), wolverine (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;), sable (&quot;Martes zibellina&quot;), Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;), East Siberian stoat (&quot;Mustela ermine kaneii&quot;), and Siberian least weasel (&quot;Mustela nivalis pygmaea&quot;). The peninsula hosts habitat for several large ungulates including the Kamchatka snow sheep, reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;), and Chukotka moose (&quot;Alces alces buturlini&quot;), one of the largest moose in the world and the largest in Eurasia, and rodents/leporids, including mountain hare (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;), marmot, and several species of lemming and squirrel. The peninsula is the breeding ground for Steller&#x27;s Sea Eagle, one of the largest eagle species, along with the Golden Eagle and Gyrfalcon.

Kamchatka most likely contains the world&#x27;s greatest diversity of salmonid fish, including all six species of anadromous Pacific salmon (chinook, coho, chum, seema, pink, and sockeye). Due to its uniquely suitable environment, biologists estimate that a fifth of all Pacific salmon originates in Kamchatka. Kurile Lake is recognized as the biggest spawning-ground for sockeye in Eurasia. In response to pressure from poaching and to worldwide decreases in salmon stocks, some along nine of the more productive salmon rivers are in the process of being set aside as a nature preserve. Stickleback species, particularly &quot;Gasterosteus aculeatus&quot; and &quot;Pungitius pungitius&quot;, also occur in many coastal drainages, and are likely present in freshwater as well.

Cetaceans that frequent the highly productive waters of the northwestern Pacific and the Okhotsk Sea include orcas, Dall&#x27;s and harbour porpoises, humpback whales, sperm whales, and fin whales. Less frequently, grey whales (from the eastern population), the critically endangered North Pacific right whale and bowhead whale, beaked whales, and minke whales are encountered. Blue whale are known to feed off of the southeastern shelf in summer. Among pinnipeds, Steller&#x27;s sea lions, northern fur seals, spotted seals, and harbor seals are abundant along much of the peninsula. Further north, walruses and bearded seals can be encountered on the Pacific side, and ribbon seals reproduce on the ice of Karaginsky Bay. Sea otters are concentrated primarily on the southern end of the peninsula.

Seabirds include murrelets, Northern Fulmars, Thick- and Thin-billed Murres, Kittiwakes, Tufted and Horned Puffins, Red-faced, Pelagic, and other Cormorants, and many other species. Typical of the northern seas, the marine fauna is likewise rich. Of commercial importance are Kamchatka crab (king crab), scallop, squid, pollock, cod, herring, halibut, and several species of flatfish.

==Tourism==
Points of interest on the Kamchatka Peninsula include thermal and mineral springs, volcanoes, glaciers, a diversity of plants and animals, and other natural features largely untouched by civilization. Activities include sport fishing, alpine tourism, heliskiing, snowboarding, dog sledding, and surfing.

<text>Pierrefonds—Dollard () is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1988. Its population was 108,587 at the 2016 Canadian Census.

This riding occupies the northwest part of the Island of Montreal on Lac des Deux-Montagnes and Rivière des Prairies. It contains the cities of Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Pierrefonds, Roxboro and L&#x27;Île-Bizard. This riding is home to a number of pharmaceutical companies. Manufacturing is the main industry, followed by retail trade. Over 17% of the population has a university degree, while just over 4% has less than a Grade 9 education. The average family income is $75,497 with an unemployment rate of 6.5%.

According to the 2001 Canadian census, 37% of the population lists English as their mother tongue, while French is the first language for 32%. There are also significant populations who speak Arabic, Italian, Spanish and Chinese. This is an ethnically mixed riding, including Italian, East Indian and Chinese communities. The total immigrant population is almost 30%.

==Geography==
The district includes the Montreal borough of Pierrefonds-Roxboro, L&#x27;Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève and the city of Dollard-des-Ormeaux.

The neighbouring ridings are Dorval—Lachine—LaSalle, Lac-Saint-Louis, Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, Laval—Les Îles and Saint-Laurent—Cartierville.

==History==
This riding was established in 1986 by combining parts of Dollard and Vaudreuil ridings. The 1996 redistribution moved nine per cent of the population of the riding into Lac-St-Louis.

In the redistribution of 2004, 91% of the riding was retained.

There were no changes to this riding during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<doc id="678691" wikidata="Q1069327" url="?curid=678691" title="Supermarine Attacker">
<text>The Supermarine Attacker is a British single-seat naval jet fighter designed and produced by aircraft manufacturer Supermarine for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm (FAA). It was the first jet fighter to enter operational service with the FAA.

In order to rapidly introduce jet aircraft to Navy service, Supermarine proposed using the wing developed for their most advanced piston-powered design, the Supermarine Spiteful, with a new fuselage for the Rolls-Royce Nene engine. Performing its maiden flight on 27 July 1946, the flight testing phase of development was protracted due to several issues, including handling difficulties. The first Attackers were introduced to FAA service in August 1951.

Common to the majority of other first-generation jet fighters, the Attacker had a relatively short service life before being replaced; this was due to increasingly advanced aircraft harnessing the jet engine being rapidly developed during the 1950s and 1960s. Despite its retirement from front line service by the FAA during 1954, only three years following its introduction, the Attacker would be adopted by the newly formed Pakistan Air Force, who would continue to operate the type possibly as late as 1964.

==Development==
===Origins===

The origins of the Attacker can be traced back to a wartime fighter jet project performed on behalf of the Royal Air Force (RAF). Many of the design&#x27;s key features and performance requirements were stipulated under Specification E.10/44 (the &quot;E&quot; standing for experimental) issued by the Air Ministry during 1944, which had called for the development of a jet fighter furnished with a laminar flow wing and a single jet engine. In response, British aircraft manufacturer Supermarine decided to produce their own submission, which involved designing a brand new fuselage, complete with intakes to provide airflow to the Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet engine powering the type. This fuselage was mated with the pre-existing laminar flow straight wings which had been designed for the Supermarine Spiteful, a piston-engined fighter that had been intended to replace the Supermarine Spitfire. 

Joe Smith presented the Type 392 for consideration and three prototypes (TS409, TS413 and TS416) were ordered. Prior to the design being officially named &quot;Attacker&quot;, the aircraft had was referred to as the &quot;Jet Spiteful&quot; with &quot;Jet Seafang&quot; for a naval version.

E.10/44 (issued February 1945) specified a maximum speed of 550 mph (885 km/h) up to 30,000 ft (9,100 m). 

As originally intended, the Type 392 was supposed to provide an interim jet fighter to equip the RAF while another aircraft, the Gloster E.1/44, that was also powered by the same Rolls-Royce Nene engine, completed development; the expectation was that, with the wing already designed, the remaining work required for the aircraft would be completed quickly. On 30 August 1944, an order for three prototypes was placed with Supermarine; it was stipulated that the second and third prototypes were both to be navalised. On 7 July 1945, a follow-on order for 24 pre-production aircraft, six for the RAF and the remaining 18 (to Specification E1/45) for the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), was placed.

Handling problems with the Spiteful prototype delayed progress on the jet-powered version, leading to the pre-production order of 24 being stopped, although work on the three prototypes continued. In January 1945 Supermarine had been ordered to stop work on their Seagull air-sea rescue amphibian and give the Type 392 maximum priority. Due to the delay, the FAA instead ordered a batch of 18 de Havilland Vampire Mk. 20s for the purpose of gaining experience with jet aircraft. After evaluating both the Jet Spiteful and the E.1/44, the RAF decided to reject both designs since neither aircraft offered any perceptible performance advantage over contemporary fighters such as the Gloster Meteor and the de Havilland Vampire, which were the RAF&#x27;s first two operational jet aircraft.

===Into flight===

Following the design&#x27;s rejection by the RAF, Supermarine decided to approach the Admiralty with an offer of developing a navalised version of the project. On 27 July 1946, the maiden flight of the type was performed by prototype Type 392 serial number &quot;TS409&quot;, a land-based version, by test pilot Jeffrey Quill. The Air Ministry issued Specification E.1/45 to cover production aircraft; meeting its various requirements necessitated a range of extensive modifications to be made to the design, including a revised fin and tailplane arrangement, as well as an increased internal fuel capacity. Accordingly, a large external ventral fuel tank was adopted, along with an extended dorsal fin and folding wing tips.

Flight testing was largely conducted at Supermarine&#x27;s newly created experimental establishment at the former RAF Chilbolton. The Attacker had several deficiencies, one of which was using the Spiteful tail-wheel undercarriage rather than a nose-wheel undercarriage, a configuration that resulted in the Attacker being considerably more difficult to land on an aircraft carrier. According to aviation author Bill Gunston, this tail-dragger undercarriage meant that, when operating from grass airfields, the jet exhaust would create a long furrow in the ground that &quot;three men could lie down in&quot;. However, according to aviation periodical Flight, claims of scorched or ploughed surfaces, even grass, were exaggerated. The Attacker was neither the only nor the first jet aircraft to be equipped with such an undercarriage, which was also used on the experimental Heinkel He 178 and several early Messerschmitt Me 262 aircraft. The chief designer at Vickers-Supermarine, Mr. Joseph Smith, claimed that testing had validated the performance of the tail-dragger undercarriage as acceptable.

On 17 June 1947, the first navalised prototype, Type 398 &quot;TS413&quot;, conducted its first flight, flown by test pilot Mike Lithgow; occurring four years after the Meteor had performed its first flight. During November 1949, production orders on behalf of the FAA were received by Supermarine. On 5 May 1950, the first production variant of the aircraft, designated &quot;Attacker F.1&quot;, performed its first flight; one year later, deliveries of the type commenced.

==Design==

The Supermarine Attacker was a navalised jet-propelled fighter aircraft, the first jet-powered aircraft to be introduced into FAA service. While originally designed to a wartime requirement for the RAF, it was not introduced until the early 1950s, and was ultimately developed for use aboard aircraft carriers. For a jet aircraft, the Attacker&#x27;s design was unusual, with a tail-dragger undercarriage with twin tailwheels, as well as an unswept wing. The flight controls were relatively conventional, based on those of the Spiteful. The forward position of the cockpit was well-received, and provided an exceptionally good view for the pilot.

The Attacker had a relatively strong structure, making extensive use of heavy-gauge materials, principally aluminium alloy, which were used with stressed-skin construction and supported by 24 closely spaced stringers and formers. The nose had an unusual &quot;lobster-claw&quot; structure, comprising thick laminated aluminium-alloy sheet at the top and bottom, with no stiffening members; it gave armour protection to the pilot and carried pressurisation loads. The tip of the nose was detachable to accommodate a gun camera or ballast; between this and the cockpit was an avionics bay. Aft of the cockpit was the semi-monocoque fuel tank, followed by the engine bay.

In terms of its aerodynamics, the Attacker was well streamlined, described by Flight as being &quot;perhaps more perfect than any other fighter&quot;. The fuselage was continuously curved with no straight lines. It was shaped to have some of the wing&#x27;s laminar flow characteristics and its lines were interrupted only by the faired cockpit canopy and the engine air intakes on either side of the cockpit. The intakes diverted the front fuselage boundary layer to prevent it entering the engine; tests with the diverters faired-over gave reduced engine performance including thrust.
The design of the wing was largely unchanged from the Spiteful, save for being slightly enlarged to match the bigger Attacker. It used split flaps along the trailing edge, as well as slotted ailerons and electrically operated trim tabs. With a single main spar and one auxiliary spar, the wing was bolted directly onto stub spar booms as there was no centre-section. The exterior skins were flush-riveted and manufactured with considerable care in an attempt to achieve the laminar flow predicted from wind tunnel tests. Flight attributed the laminar-flow wing to enabling the Attacker to exceed the maximum speed of the Spiteful by more than 100 mph. However, other reports claim that the Attacker&#x27;s wing was aerodynamically inferior to the original elliptical wing of the Spitfire, possessing unfavourable characteristics such as a lower critical Mach number.

The Attacker was powered by a single Rolls-Royce Nene Mk. 101 turbojet engine; at the time, the Nene was the most powerful jet engine in the world, with a thrust of 5,000 lb. The engine was supported by a heavy box-section rear spar frame, which was braced fore and aft to the main spar. As the jet-pipe was relatively long, a manually operated variable exhaust outlet was used during engine starting to prevent jet-pipe resonances and excessive turbine temperatures. The exterior skin surrounding the intake had several louvres to regulate pressures during starting; they automatically closed to seal the engine bay after starting. The engine bay incorporated a pilot-operated fire extinguisher system. Although an automatic fuel transfer system was not originally incorporated, experience with the initial prototypes led to its incorporation.

In terms of armament, the Attacker F.1 had four 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk. V cannon; at the time, this was viewed as the standard armament for a frontline RAF fighter. These cannon were fired using electronically operated Maxifiux-Star units. The inboard cannon had a maximum capacity of 167 rounds of ammunition each, while the outboard cannon had up to 145 rounds each. External stores included two 1,000 lb bombs or four 300 lb rockets.

==Operational history==
===Britain===
During August 1951, the Attacker entered operational service with the FAA; the first squadron to receive production aircraft was 800 Naval Air Squadron, based at RNAS Ford. Following the introduction of the Attacker F.1, two further variants of the aircraft were developed and produced for the FAA. The &quot;Attacker FB.1&quot; was a fighter-bomber that differed little from the original F.1 model, except that it was expected to operate as a ground attack aircraft. The third, and last, variant was the &quot;Attacker FB.2&quot;, which was powered by a more capable model of the Nene engine that was accompanied by various modifications to its structure. On this model, the Supermarine Attacker was furnished with a total of eight underwing hard points, which could carry a pair of 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs or a maximum of eight unguided rockets.

Across the three variants to be adopted by the FAA, a total of 146 production Attackers would be delivered to the service. It had a relatively brief career with the FAA, none of its variants seeing any action during the type&#x27;s service life with the FAA and being taken out of first-line service during 1954. The type had been replaced in front line squadrons by multiple more capable jet-propelled fighters, including the Hawker Sea Hawk and de Havilland Sea Venom. For several further years, the Attacker remained in service with squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), the type being finally taken out of reserve service during early 1957.

===Pakistan===

During the early 1950s, the Royal Pakistan Air Force (RPAF) sought to acquire its first-ever jet-powered aircraft. A combination of a lack of funds and political pressure that was exerted by British suppliers persuaded the service to acquire a variant of the Attacker known as the &quot;Type 538&quot;, which was essentially a &quot;de-navalised&quot; variant of the aircraft used by the FAA.

Pakistan received its first Attackers in 1951, with deliveries eventually reaching 36 units. Only a single squadron was ever equipped with these aircraft, an interceptor unit, the No. 11 Squadron, with the Attackers also equipping the PAF&#x27;s first aerial display team, the &quot;Paybills&quot;. No. 11 Squadron&#x27;s Attackers remained operational for seven years with the last examples withdrawn from service in 1956 when they were replaced with the North American F-86F Sabres. Officially, the Attacker remained in Pakistani service until 1958, although some sources claim the aircraft were still being used as late as 1964.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 23 May 1950, Vickers test pilot Les Colquhoun was flying the first production Attacker F.1 &quot;WA469&quot;. He was carrying out high-speed tests when during one of the tests the outer portion of the starboard wing folded up and the ailerons became locked. Colquhoun decided not to eject and managed to do a high-speed landing at Chilbolton, in the course of which he used all but the last 100 yards (90 m) of the runway and burst a tyre. The intact aircraft was examined so the cause of the incident could be discovered, Colquhoun was awarded the George Medal for his efforts in saving the aircraft.
*On 5 February 1953, Attacker FB.1 &quot;WA535&quot; from RNAS Stretton crashed near Winwick, Cheshire, killing the pilot Mr Roy Edwin Collingwood.
*On 21 July 1953, Attacker FB.2 WP293 (803 NAS) from RNAS Ford, crashed at North Stoke Farm, near Arundel, Sussex, killing the pilot Lieutenant Commander William T R Smith.
*On 10 November 1955, an accident involving Attacker FB.2 &quot;WP281&quot;, claimed the life of the chief Flying Instructor, Lieutenant Commander Charles James Lavender DSC when he tried to avoid collision with a Percival Sea Prince near RNAS Stretton.
*On 26 June 1956, Attacker FB.1 &quot;WK328&quot; practicing deck landings at RNAS Ford crashed near the parish church at Climping, West Sussex. The pilot, Lieutenant Jack Stanner Wyatt of 1832 (RNVR) Squadron, was killed. He was later buried in the churchyard he crashed close to.
*On 6 July 1956, Attacker &quot;WP275&quot; crashed into the English Channel off Littlehampton, West Sussex after a wing folded in flight; the pilot ejected safely. Parts of the aircraft were brought to the surface by a dredging vessel in 2005.
*15 July 1956 &quot;WP283&quot;, Attacker FB2, 1833 Sqn stalled on approach to RAF Honiley and crashed on a road, killing a civilian.

==Surviving aircraft==

Following its retirement from service in 1956, Attacker F.1 Serial number &quot;WA473&quot; was placed on display on the gate at RNAS Abbotsinch. Completed at VAs South Marston factory in July 1951, it had served with 702 and 736 Naval Squadrons. In late 1961, it was moved to the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Somerset.

<doc id="678694" wikidata="Q1855582" url="?curid=678694" title="Small Form-factor Pluggable">
<text>Small Form-factor Pluggable (SFP) is a compact, hot-pluggable network interface module format used for both telecommunication and data communications applications. An SFP interface on networking hardware is a modular slot for a media-specific transceiver, such as for a fiber-optic cable or a copper cable. The advantage of using SFPs compared to fixed interfaces (e.g. modular connectors in Ethernet switches) is that individual ports can be equipped with different types of transceivers as required, with the majority including optical line terminals, network cards, switches and routers.

The form factor and electrical interface are specified by a multi-source agreement (MSA) under the auspices of the Small Form Factor Committee. The SFP replaced the larger gigabit interface converter (GBIC) in most applications, and has been referred to as a Mini-GBIC by some vendors.

SFP transceivers exist supporting synchronous optical networking (SONET), Gigabit Ethernet, Fibre Channel, PON, and other communications standards. At introduction, typical speeds were for Ethernet SFPs and up to for Fibre Channel SFP modules. In 2006, SFP+ specification brought speeds up to and the later SFP28 iteration, introduced in 2014, is designed for speeds of .

A slightly larger sibling is the four-lane Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP). The additional lanes allow for speeds 4 times their corresponding SFP. In 2014, the QSFP28 variant was published allowing speeds up to . In 2019, the closely related QSFP56 was standardized doubling the top speeds to with products already selling from major vendors. There are inexpensive adapters allowing SFP transceivers to be placed in a QSFP port.

Both a SFP-DD, which allows for over two lanes, as well as a QSFP-DD specifications, which allows for over eight lanes, have been published. These use a form factor which is directly backward compatible to their respective predecessors.

An even larger sibling, the Octal Small Format Pluggable (OSFP), had products released in 2022 capable of links between network equipment. It is a slightly larger version than the QSFP form factor allowing for larger power outputs. The OSFP standard was initially announced in 2016 with the 4.0 version released in 2021 allowing for via 8× electrical data lanes. Its proponents say a low-cost adapter will allow for backwards compatibility with QSFP modules.

==SFP types==
SFP transceivers are available with a variety of transmitter and receiver specifications, allowing users to select the appropriate transceiver for each link to provide the required &quot;optical&quot; or &quot;electrical reach&quot; over the available media type (e.g. twisted pair or twinaxial copper cables, multi-mode or single-mode fiber cables). Transceivers are also designated by their transmission speed. SFP modules are commonly available in several different categories.

Note that the QSFP/QSFP+/QSFP28/QSFP56 are designed to be electrically backward compatible with SFP/SFP+/SFP28 or SFP56 respectively. Using a simple adapter or a special direct attached cable it is possible to connect those interfaces together using just one lane instead of four provided by the QSFP/QSFP+/QSFP28/QSFP56 form factor. The same applies to the QSFP-DD form factor with 8 lanes which can work downgraded to 4/2/1 lanes.

** 1000BASE-Tthese modules incorporate significant interface circuitry for Physical Coding Sublayer recoding and can be used only for gigabit Ethernet because of the specific line code. They are not compatible with (or rather: do not have equivalents for) Fibre Channel or SONET. Unlike most non-SFP, copper 1000BASE-T ports integrated into most routers and switches, 1000BASE-T SFPs usually cannot operate at 100BASE-TX speeds.
* copper and opticalsome vendors have shipped limited SFPs for fiber-to-the-home applications and drop-in replacement of legacy 100BASE-FX circuits. These are relatively uncommon and can be easily confused with SFPs.
* Although it is not mentioned in any official specification document the maximum data rate of the original SFP standard is . This was eventually used by both 4GFC Fibre Channel and the DDR Infiniband especially in its four-lane QSFP form.
*In recent years, SFP transceivers have been created that will allow 2. and Ethernet speeds with SFPs with 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T.

=== SFP+===
The SFP+ (enhanced small form-factor pluggable) is an enhanced version of the SFP that supports data rates up to 16 Gbit/s. The SFP+ specification was first published on May 9, 2006, and version 4.1 was published on July 6, 2009. SFP+ supports Fibre Channel, 10 Gigabit Ethernet and Optical Transport Network standard OTU2. It is a popular industry format supported by many network component vendors. Although the SFP+ standard does not include mention of Fibre Channel, it can be used at this speed. Besides the data rate, the major difference between 8 and Fibre Channel is the encoding method. The 64b/66b encoding used for is a more efficient encoding mechanism than 8b/10b used for , and allows for the data rate to double without doubling the line rate. 16GFC doesn&#x27;t really use signaling anywhere. It uses a 14. line rate to achieve twice the throughput of 8GFC.

SFP+ also introduces direct attach for connecting two SFP+ ports without dedicated transceivers. Direct attach cables (DAC) exist in passive (up to 7 m), active (up to 15 m), and active optical (AOC, up to 100 m) variants.

 SFP+ modules are exactly the same dimensions as regular SFPs, allowing the equipment manufacturer to re-use existing physical designs for 24 and 48-port switches and modular line cards. In comparison to earlier XENPAK or XFP modules, SFP+ modules leave more circuitry to be implemented on the host board instead of inside the module. Through the use of an active electronic adapter, SFP+ modules may be used in older equipment with XENPAK ports and X2 ports.

SFP+ modules can be described as &quot;limiting&quot; or &quot;linear&quot; types; this describes the functionality of the inbuilt electronics. Limiting SFP+ modules include a signal amplifier to re-shape the (degraded) received signal whereas linear ones do not. Linear modules are mainly used with the low bandwidth standards such as 10GBASE-LRM; otherwise, limiting modules are preferred.

=== SFP28 ===
SFP28 is a interface which evolved from the 100 Gigabit Ethernet interface which is typically implemented with 4 by data lanes. Identical in mechanical dimensions to SFP and SFP+, SFP28 implements one lane accommodating of data with encoding overhead.

SFP28 modules exist supporting single- or multi-mode fiber connections, active optical cable and direct attach copper.

===cSFP===
The compact small form-factor pluggable (cSFP) is a version of SFP with the same mechanical form factor allowing two independent bidirectional channels per port. It is used primarily to increase port density and decrease fiber usage per port.

===SFP-DD===
The small form-factor pluggable double density (SFP-DD) multi-source agreement is a standard published in 2019 for doubling port density. According to the SFD-DD MSA website: &quot;Network equipment based on the SFP-DD will support legacy SFP modules and cables, and new double density products.&quot;
SFP-DD uses two lanes to transmit.

Currently, the following speeds are defined:
* SFP112: using PAM4 on a single pair (not double density)
* SFP-DD: using PAM4 and using NRZ
* SFP-DD112: using PAM4
* QSFP112: (4 × )
* QSFP-DD: / (8 × and 8 × )
* QSFP-DD800 (formerly QSFP-DD112): (8 × )
* QSFP-DD1600 (Draft) 

== QSFP ==
&quot;Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable&quot; (&quot;QSFP&quot;) transceivers are available with a variety of transmitter and receiver types, allowing users to select the appropriate transceiver for each link to provide the required &quot;optical reach&quot; over multi-mode or single-mode fiber.

; : The original QSFP document specified four channels carrying Gigabit Ethernet, 4GFC (FiberChannel), or DDR InfiniBand.
; (QSFP+): QSFP+ is an evolution of QSFP to support four channels carrying 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 10GFC FiberChannel, or QDR InfiniBand. The 4 channels can also be combined into a single 40 Gigabit Ethernet link.
; (QSFP14): The QSFP14 standard is designed to carry FDR InfiniBand, SAS-3 or 16G Fibre Channel.
; (QSFP28): The QSFP28 standard is designed to carry 100 Gigabit Ethernet, EDR InfiniBand, or 32G Fibre Channel. Sometimes this transceiver type is also referred to as &quot;QSFP100&quot; or &quot;100G QSFP&quot; for sake of simplicity.
; (QSFP56): QSFP56 is designed to carry 200 Gigabit Ethernet, HDR InfiniBand, or 64G Fibre Channel. The biggest enhancement is that QSFP56 uses four-level pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM-4) instead of non-return-to-zero (NRZ). It uses the same physical specifications as QSFP28 (SFF-8665), with electrical specifications from SFF-8024 and revision 2.10a of SFF-8636. Sometimes this transceiver type is referred to as &quot;200G QSFP&quot; for sake of simplicity.

Switch and router manufacturers implementing QSFP+ ports in their products frequently allow for the use of a single QSFP+ port as four independent 10 Gigabit Ethernet connections, greatly increasing port density. For example, a typical 24-port QSFP+ 1U switch would be able to service 96x10GbE connections. There also exist fanout cables to adapt a single QSFP28 port to four independent 25 Gigabit Ethernet SFP28 ports (QSFP28-to-4×SFP28) as well as cables to adapt a single QSFP56 port to four independent 50 Gigabit Ethernet SFP56 ports (QSFP56-to-4×SFP56).

==Applications==
SFP sockets are found in Ethernet switches, routers, firewalls and network interface cards. They are used in Fibre Channel host adapters and storage equipment. Because of their low cost, low profile, and ability to provide a connection to different types of optical fiber, SFP provides such equipment with enhanced flexibility. 

SFP sockets and transceivers are also used for long-distance serial digital interface (SDI) transmission.

==Standardization==
The SFP transceiver is not standardized by any official standards body, but rather is specified by a multi-source agreement (MSA) among competing manufacturers. The SFP was designed after the GBIC interface, and allows greater &quot;port density&quot; (number of transceivers per given area) than the GBIC, which is why SFP is also known as mini-GBIC.

However, as a practical matter, some networking equipment manufacturers engage in vendor lock-in practices whereby they deliberately break compatibility with &quot;generic&quot; SFPs by adding a check in the device&#x27;s firmware that will enable only the vendor&#x27;s own modules. Third-party SFP manufacturers have introduced SFPs with EEPROMs which may be programmed to match any vendor ID.

==Signals==

SFP transceivers are &quot;right-handed&quot;: From their perspective, they transmit on the right and receive on the left. When looking into the optical connectors, transmission comes from the left and reception is on the right.

The SFP transceiver contains a printed circuit board with an edge connector with 20 pads that mate on the rear with the SFP electrical connector in the host system. The QSFP has 38 pads including 4 high-speed transmit data pairs and 4 high-speed receive data pairs.

==Mechanical dimensions==
The physical dimensions of the SFP transceiver (and its subsequent faster variants) are narrower than the later QSFP counterparts, which allows for SFP transceivers to be placed in QSFP ports via an inexpensive adapter. Both are smaller than the XFP transceiver.

==EEPROM information==

The SFP MSA defines a 256-byte memory map into an EEPROM describing the transceiver&#x27;s capabilities, standard interfaces, manufacturer, and other information, which is accessible over a serial I²C interface at the 8-bit address 0b1010000X (0xA0).

==Digital diagnostics monitoring==

Modern optical SFP transceivers support standard digital diagnostics monitoring (DDM) functions. This feature is also known as digital optical monitoring (DOM). This capability allows monitoring of the SFP operating parameters in real time. Parameters include optical output power, optical input power, temperature, laser bias current, and transceiver supply voltage. In network equipment, this information is typically made available via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). A DDM interface allows end users to display diagnostics data and alarms for optical fiber transceivers and can be used to diagnose why a transceiver is not working.

<doc id="678695" wikidata="Q45085" url="?curid=678695" title="Fast bowling">
<text>Fast bowling (also referred to as pace bowling) is a type of bowling in cricket, in which the ball is delivered at high speed. The fastest bowlers bowl the ball at over . Practitioners of fast bowling are known as fast bowlers or quicks. Also included in this broad category are bowlers who do not achieve the highest speeds, who may instead be known by a range of other terms, such as medium fast bowlers.

In addition to delivering the ball at speed, this type of bowler may also use seam bowling or swing bowling techniques, to make it even harder for the batter to play the ball correctly. The mixture of speed, seam and swing that can be achieved depends on several factors, including the individual bowler&#x27;s skill, the condition of the ball, and the weather. Seam and swing are particularly important for bowlers who do not achieve the highest speeds. Therefore, they might also be referred to as a seam bowler, a swing bowler, or a fast bowler who can swing it, for example, if this is the predominant characteristic of their deliveries. Strictly speaking, a pure swing bowler does not need to have a high degree of pace, though dedicated medium-pace swing bowlers are rarely seen at Test level in modern times.

Fast bowling is one of the two main approaches to bowling, the other being spin bowling.

== Terminology ==
Pace bowlers may be classified based on quantitative or qualitative attributes.

A widespread method of classification is based on average ball release speed. However, there is no universally accepted set of definitions and the categorisation of bowlers according to speed may take into account competition level and gender. Terms used in different classifications include &quot;slow medium&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;, &quot;fast medium&quot;, &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;express&quot;. ESPNcricinfo, a popular cricket news website, uses both &quot;medium fast&quot; and &quot;fast medium&quot; in addition to &quot;medium&quot; and &quot;fast&quot;.

Bowlers may be categorised according to their use of swing bowling or seam bowling techniques, although the term &quot;seamer&quot; is also commonly used to refer to pace bowlers in general.

== Strike bowling ==

Strike bowling is the term usually applied to bowlers who are used primarily to take wickets rather than restrict runs. Typically, strike bowlers work in short spells, either at the start of an innings or to confront new batters, although they are also employed tactically at other times. For fast bowlers, results can be achieved through sheer speed and aggression, rather than by trying to make the ball move through the air (swing bowling) or off the pitch (seam bowling). More commonly, however, a combined approach is adopted to produce balls that the batter finds difficult or impossible to play, whatever the speed at which they are delivered. In this respect, the inswinging yorker is a good example of delivery that, even when bowled relatively slowly, can nevertheless be highly effective.

== Swing bowling ==
Swing bowlers cause the ball to move laterally through the air, rather than off the pitch like seam bowlers. Normal or conventional swing bowling is encouraged by the raised seam of the ball, and conventional swing is usually greatest when the ball is new and therefore has a pronounced seam. As the ball gets older, the wear makes swing more difficult to achieve, but this can be countered if the fielding team systematically polishes one side of the ball while allowing the other to become rough. When the ball has been polished highly on one side and not on the other and if the ball is bowled very fast (over ), it produces a reverse swing such that the ball swings in the opposite direction as in conventional swing. Contrary to popular opinion, this swing is not produced by air flowing faster over the smooth or &quot;shiny&quot; side as compared to the rough side.

Swing is produced due to a net force acting on the ball from one side; that is, the side with the more turbulent boundary layer. For conventional swing bowling, the raised seam and the direction it points governs the direction of swing. Due to the angled seam of the ball, air flowing over the seam produces turbulence on the side that the seam is angled toward. This causes the boundary layer to separate from the surface of the ball later (further toward the rear of the ball) than the other side where it separates earlier (further forward on the surface). The resulting net force acts so as to move or swing the ball in the direction of the angled seam. Conventional swing bowling is delivered with the seam angled such that the smooth or polished side of the ball faces forward to move the ball in the direction of the seam &quot;i.e.&quot; toward the rough side.

A swinging ball is classed as either an outswinger, which moves away from the batter, or an inswinger, which moves in toward the batter. In most cases the outswinger is seen as the more dangerous ball because, if the batter fails to recognise it, it catches the outside edge of the bat instead of the middle and fly up to be caught in the slips. Inswingers have their place too, especially combined with the yorker as this can result in the ball either breaking the wicket (by going clean &quot;through the gate&quot; or getting an inside edge) or hitting the pad rather than the bat (resulting in a possible LBW decision).

Swing bowling can also be roughly categorised as early swing or late swing, corresponding to when in the trajectory the ball changes direction. The later the ball swings, the less chance the batter has of adjusting to account for the swing.

Bowlers usually use the same grip and technique on swing balls as fast balls, though they usually keep the seam slightly rather than straight, and may use the slower ball grip. It is difficult to achieve swing with a cutter grip since the ball spins in flight, varying the orientation of the shiny and rough surfaces as it moves through the air. Many players, commentators on the game, and fans agree that swing is easier to achieve in humid or overcast conditions, and also that the red ball used in Test cricket swings more than the white ball used in the one-day game.

=== Reverse swing ===
Reverse swing is a phenomenon that makes the ball swing in the opposite direction to that usually produced by the orientation of the shiny and rough sides of the ball. When the ball is reverse swinging, the ball swings towards the shiny side. Balls that reverse swing move much later and much more sharply than those swinging conventionally, both factors increasing the difficulty the batter has in trying to hit the ball. At speeds of over 90 mph a ball always exhibits reverse swing, but as roughness increases on the leading side, the speed at which reverse swing occurs decreases. This means that an older ball is more likely to be delivered with reverse swing as its surface is roughened through use.

In reverse swing the seam is angled in the same way as in conventional swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a golf ball. In case of the golf ball, turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of the boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back. This enables the golf ball to travel further.

The discovery of reverse swing is credited to Pakistan&#x27;s cricketers, with Sarfraz Nawaz and Farrukh Ahmed Khan, both named as originators of the delivery.

== Risks of injuries ==
Fast bowlers typically experience the highest incidence of injury of all player roles in cricket. The largest time-loss injuries are typically associated with overuse at the site of the lumbar spine. Common injuries include spondylolisthesis (stress fracture of the lower back), navicular stress fractures in the foot, shoulder injuries or lesions, side strains or intercostal strains and muscular strains of the calves, hamstrings or spinal erectors. Popular media and commentators are often critical of the number of injuries suffered by fast bowlers. However, as of 2019, injury rates are at their lowest in decades, in many parts thanks to advances in physical conditioning, sport science, and load management interventions.

<doc id="678698" wikidata="Q1287971" url="?curid=678698" title="Oku no Hosomichi">
<text>Oku no Hosomichi (, originally ), translated as The Narrow Road to the Deep North and The Narrow Road to the Interior, is a major work of &quot;haibun&quot; by the Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō, considered one of the major texts of Japanese literature of the Edo period.
The first edition was published posthumously in 1702.

The text is written in the form of a prose and verse travel diary and was penned as Bashō made an epic and dangerous journey on foot through the Edo Japan of the late 17th century. While the poetic work became seminal of its own account, the poet&#x27;s travels in the text have since inspired many people to follow in his footsteps and trace his journey for themselves. In one of its most memorable passages, Bashō suggests that &quot;every day is a journey, and the journey itself home&quot;. The text was also influenced by the works of Du Fu, who was highly revered by Bashō.

Of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, Kenji Miyazawa once suggested, &quot;It was as if the very soul of Japan had itself written it.&quot;

==The text==

===Opening sentences===
Bashō&#x27;s introductory sentences are the most quoted of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;:
===Plot===
&quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; was written based on a journey taken by Bashō in the late spring of 1689. He and his traveling companion Kawai Sora (河合曾良) departed from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) for the northerly interior region known as Oku, propelled mostly by a desire to see the places about which the old poets wrote in an effort to &quot;renew his own art.&quot; Specifically, he was emulating Saigyō, whom Bashō praised as the greatest waka poet; Bashō made a point of visiting all the sites mentioned in Saigyō&#x27;s verse. Travel in those days was very dangerous, but Bashō was committed to a kind of poetic ideal of wandering. He traveled for about 156 days altogether, covering almost , mostly on foot. Of all of Bashō&#x27;s works, this is the best known.

This poetic diary is in the form known as &quot;haibun&quot;, a combination of prose and haiku. It contains many references to Confucius, Saigyō, Du Fu, ancient Chinese poetry, and even &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot;. It manages to strike a delicate balance between all the elements to produce a powerful account. It is primarily a travel account, and Bashō vividly relates the unique poetic essence of each stop in his travels. Stops on his journey include the Tokugawa shrine at Nikkō, the Shirakawa barrier, the islands of Matsushima, Hiraizumi, Sakata, Kisakata, and Etchū. He and Sora parted at Yamanaka, but at Ōgaki he briefly met up with a few of his other disciples before departing again to the Ise Shrine and closing the account.

After his journey, he spent five years working and reworking the poems and prose of &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; before publishing it. Based on differences between draft versions of the account, Sora&#x27;s diary, and the final version, it is clear that Bashō took a number of artistic liberties in the writing. An example of this is that in the &quot;Senjūshu&quot; (&quot;Selection of Tales&quot;) attributed to Saigyō, the narrator is passing through Eguchi when he is driven by a storm to seek shelter in the nearby cottage of a prostitute; this leads to an exchange of poems, after which he spends the night there. Bashō similarly includes in &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; a tale of him having an exchange with prostitutes staying in the same inn, but Sora mentions nothing.

==Philosophy behind the text==

Nobuyuki Yuasa notes that Bashō studied Zen meditation under the guidance of the Priest Buccho, though it is uncertain whether Bashō ever attained enlightenment. The Japanese Zen scholar D. T. Suzuki has described Bashō&#x27;s philosophy in writing poetry as one requiring that both &quot;subject and object were entirely annihilated&quot; in meditative experience. Yuasa likewise writes: &quot;Bashō had been casting away his earthly attachments, one by one, in the years preceding the journey, and now he had nothing else to cast away but his own self which was in him as well as around him. He had to cast this self away, for otherwise he was not able to restore his true identity (what he calls the &#x27;everlasting self which is poetry). Yuasa notes &quot;&quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; is Bashō&#x27;s study in eternity, and in so far as he has succeeded in this attempt, it is also a monument he has set up against the flow of time.&quot;

References in Contemporary Literature

&#x27;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&#x27; is the title of a 2013 novel by Australian author Richard Flanagan, describing the life of the World War 2 Australian POWs building the Siam (sic) to Burma railway. It won the 2014 Booker Prize. During the novel two Japanese officiers discuss Basho&#x27;s haibun.

<text>The Taguba Report, officially titled US Army 15-6 Report of Abuse of Prisoners in Iraq, is a report published in May 2004 containing the findings from an official military inquiry into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse. It is named after Major General Antonio Taguba, the report&#x27;s principal author.

==Initiation==
Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, the senior officer in Iraq, appointed Major General Antonio Taguba to open an Army Regulation 15-6 investigation into the conduct of the 800th Military Police Brigade.

According to the report, the inquiry was initiated because:
:&quot;LTG Sanchez requested an investigation of detention and internment operations by the Brigade from 1 November 2003 to present. LTG Sanchez cited recent reports of detainee abuse, escapes from confinement facilities, and accountability lapses, which indicated systemic problems within the brigade and suggested a lack of clear standards, proficiency, and leadership.&quot;

According to Taguba, his mandate was limited to examining the actions of the military police at Abu Ghraib and he was blocked from investigating further up the chain of command.

==Findings==

In his Findings of Fact, Major General Taguba wrote: 

&quot;That between October and December 2003, at the Abu Ghraib Confinement Facility (BCCF), numerous incidents of sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses were inflicted on several detainees. This systemic and illegal abuse of detainees was intentionally perpetrated by several members of the military police guard force (372nd Military Police Company, 320th Military Police Battalion, 800th MP Brigade), in Tier (section) 1-A of the Abu Ghraib Prison (BCCF). The allegations of abuse were substantiated by detailed witness statements (ANNEX 26) and the discovery of extremely graphic photographic evidence...In addition to the aforementioned crimes, there were also abuses committed by members of the 325th MI Battalion, 205th MI Brigade, and Joint Interrogation and Debriefing Center (JIDC). Specifically, on 24 November 2003, [name redacted], 205th MI Brigade, sought to degrade a detainee by having him strip and returned to cell naked. (ANNEXES 26 and 53)&quot;.
In addition he found: 

&quot;...that the intentional abuse of detainees by military police personnel included the following acts:
a. (S) Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees; jumping on their naked feet;
b. (S) Videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees;
c. (S) Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for
photographing;
d. (S) Forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several
days at a time;
e. (S) Forcing naked male detainees to wear women&#x27;s underwear;
f. (S) Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being
photographed and videotaped;
g. (S) Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them;
h. (S) Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE Box, with a sandbag on his head, and
attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and penis to simulate electric torture;
i. (S) Writing “I am a Rapeist” (sic) on the leg of a detainee alleged to have forcibly
raped a 15-year old fellow detainee, and then photographing him naked;
j. (S) Placing a dog chain or strap around a naked detainee&#x27;s neck and having a
female Soldier pose for a picture;
k. (S) A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee;
l. (S) Using military working dogs (without muzzles) to intimidate and frighten
detainees, and in at least one case biting and severely injuring a detainee;
m. (S) Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees. (ANNEXES 25 and 26)&quot; And that these &quot;...findings are amply supported by written confessions provided by several of the suspects, written statements provided by detainees, and witness statements.&quot;

Major General Taguba also determined that the testimony of several detainees was &quot;...credible based on the clarity of their statements and supporting evidence provided by other witnesses (ANNEX 26)&quot;. The detainees described the following acts of abuse:

&quot;a. (U) Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid on detainees;
b. (U) Threatening detainees with a charged 9mm pistol;
c. (U) Pouring cold water on naked detainees;
d. (U) Beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair;
e. (U) Threatening male detainees with rape;
f. (U) Allowing a military police guard to stitch the wound of a detainee who was
injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell;
g. (U) Sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broom stick.
h. (U) Using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats
of attack, and in one instance actually biting a detainee.&quot;
The Report recommended increased training of interrogators and the dissemination of information regarding the treatment of prisoners, both actions emphasizing the Geneva Conventions.

The Report team was also tasked with addressing the problem of detainee escapes. The Report found significant inconsistencies in the handling and processing of detainees. It recommended the standardization of detainee processing routines, the updating of accounting systems, the improvement of structural features, and several other recommendations.

<text>Castra () is a Latin term used during the Roman Republic and Roman Empire for a military &#x27;camp&#x27;, and castrum () for a &#x27;fort&#x27;. Either could refer to a building or plot of land, used as a fortified military base. 

In English usage, &quot;castrum&quot; commonly translates to &quot;Roman fort&quot;, &quot;Roman camp&quot; and &quot;Roman fortress&quot;. Scholastic convention tends to translate &quot;castrum&quot; as &quot;fort&quot;, &quot;camp&quot;, &quot;marching camp&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;.

Romans used the term &quot;castrum&quot; for different sizes of camps – including large legionary fortresses, smaller forts for cohorts or for auxiliary forces, temporary encampments, and &quot;marching&quot; forts. The diminutive form &quot;castellum&quot; was used for fortlets, typically occupied by a detachment of a cohort or a &quot;centuria&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Castrum&quot; appears in Oscan and Umbrian, two other Italic languages, suggesting an origin at least as old as Proto-Italic language. Julius Pokorny traces a probable derivation from *k̂es-, &#x27;cut&#x27;, in *k̂es-tro-m, &#x27;cutting tool&#x27;. These Italic reflexes based on *kastrom include Oscan (genitive case) and Umbrian , (accusative case). They have the same meaning, says Pokorny, as Latin , an estate, or tract of land. This is not any land but is a prepared or cultivated tract, such as a farm enclosed by a fence or a wooden or stone wall of some kind. Cornelius Nepos uses Latin in that sense: when Alcibiades deserts to the Persians, Pharnabazus gives him an estate () worth 500 talents in tax revenues. This is a change of meaning from the reflexes in other languages, which still mean some sort of knife, axe, or spear. Pokorny explains it as &quot;a camp, as a cut-off piece of land&quot;.

If this is the civilian interpretation, the military version must be &quot;military reservation&quot;, a piece of land cut off from the common land around it and modified for military use. All castra must be defended by works, often no more than a stockade, for which the soldiers carried stakes, and a ditch. The could be prepared under attack within a hollow square or behind a battle line. Considering that the earliest military shelters were tents made of hide or cloth, and all but the most permanent bases housed the men in tents placed in quadrangles and separated by numbered streets, one may well have acquired the connotation of tent.

=== Linguistic development ===
The commonest Latin syntagmata (here phrases) for the term are:
; : Permanent camp/fortresses
; : Summer camp/fortresses
; : Winter camp/fortresses
; / : Navy camp/fortresses

In Latin the term is much more frequently used as a proper name for geographical locations: e.g., , , , , . The plural was also used as a place name, as , and from this comes the Welsh place name prefix (e.g. Caerleon and Caerwent) and English suffixes &quot;-caster&quot; and &quot;-chester&quot; (e.g. Winchester and Lancaster). , &quot;son of the camps&quot;, was one of the names used by the emperor Caligula and then also by other emperors.

, also derived from , is a common Spanish family name as well as toponym in Spain and other Hispanophone countries, Italy, and the Balkans, either by itself or in various compounds such as the World Heritage Site of (earlier ). The terms (&quot;army camp&quot;) and (&quot;fortification&quot;) were used by Greek language authors to translate and , respectively.

==Description==
A &quot;castrum&quot; was designed to house and protect the soldiers, their equipment and supplies when they were not fighting or marching. The most detailed description that survives about Roman military camps is &quot;De Munitionibus Castrorum&quot;, a manuscript of 11 pages that dates most probably from the late 1st to early 2nd century AD.

Regulations required a major unit in the field to retire to a properly constructed camp every day. &quot;… as soon as they have marched into an enemy&#x27;s land, they do not begin to fight until they have walled their camp about; nor is the fence they raise rashly made, or uneven; nor do they all abide ill it, nor do those that are in it take their places at random; but if it happens that the ground is uneven, it is first levelled: their camp is also four-square by measure, and carpenters are ready, in great numbers, with their tools, to erect their buildings for them.&quot; To this end a marching column ported the equipment needed to build and stock the camp in a baggage train of wagons and on the backs of the soldiers. The camp allowed the Romans to keep a rested and supplied army in the field. Neither the Celtic nor Germanic armies had this capability: they found it necessary to disperse after only a few days.

Camps were the responsibility of engineering units to which specialists of many types belonged, officered by &quot;architecti&quot;, &quot;chief engineers&quot;, who requisitioned manual labor from the soldiers at large as required. A unit could throw up a camp under enemy attack in as little as a few hours. Judging from the names, they probably used a repertory of camp plans, selecting the one appropriate to the length of time a legion would spend in it: &quot;tertia castra&quot;, &quot;quarta castra&quot;, etc. (&quot;a camp of three days&quot;, &quot;four days&quot;, etc.).

More permanent camps were &quot;castra stativa&quot; (&quot;standing camps&quot;). The least permanent of these were &quot;castra aestiva&quot; or &quot;aestivalia&quot;, &quot;summer camps&quot;, in which the soldiers were housed &quot;sub pellibus&quot; or &quot;sub tentoriis&quot;, &quot;under tents&quot;. The largest castra were &quot;legionary fortresses&quot; built as bases for one or more whole legions. Summer was the campaign season. For the winter the soldiers retired to &quot;castra hiberna&quot; containing barracks and other buildings of more solid materials, with timber construction gradually being replaced by stone. &quot;Castra hibernas&quot; held eight soldiers to a room, who slept on bunkbeds. The soldiers in each room were also required to cook their own meals and eat with their &quot;roommates&quot;.

From the time of Augustus more permanent castra with wooden or stone buildings and walls were introduced as the distant and hard-won boundaries of the expanding empire required permanent garrisons to control local and external threats from warlike tribes. Previously, legions were raised for specific military campaigns and subsequently disbanded, requiring only temporary castra. From then on many castra of various sizes were established, many of which became permanent settlements.

==Plan of forts==


===Sources and origins===
From the most ancient times Roman camps were constructed according to a certain ideal pattern, formally described in two main sources, the &quot;De Munitionibus Castrorum&quot; and the works of Polybius. Alan Richardson compares both original authors and concludes that &quot;the Hyginian model greatly reduced the area and perimeter length for any given force.&quot; P. Fl. Vegetius Renatus has a small section on entrenched camps as well. The terminology varies, but the basic plan is the same. The hypothesis of an Etruscan origin is a viable alternative.

===Layout===


The ideal enforced a linear plan for a camp or fort: a square for camps to contain one legion or smaller unit, a rectangle for two legions, each legion being placed back-to-back with headquarters next to each other. The religious devotion of the Romans to geometry caused them to build into their camps whole-numbered right triangles. Laying it out was a geometric exercise conducted by experienced officers called &quot;metatores&quot;, who used graduated measuring rods called &quot;decempedae&quot; (&quot;10-footers&quot;) and &quot;gromatici&quot; who used a groma, a sighting device consisting of a vertical staff with horizontal cross pieces and vertical plumb-lines. Ideally the process started in the centre of the planned camp at the site of the headquarters tent or building (&quot;principia&quot;). Streets and other features were marked with coloured pennants or rods. Richardson writes that from the aspect ratio of the castra one could determine the order of battle, and the size of the legion it housed determined the area of the camp. Steinhoff theorizes that Richardson has identified a commonality and builds on the latter&#x27;s detailed studies to suggest that North African encampments in the time of Hadrian were based on the same geometrical skill.

The street plans of various present-day cities still retain traces of a Roman camp, for example Marsala in Sicily, the ancient Lilybaeum, where the name of the main street, the Cassaro, perpetuates the name &quot;castrum&quot;.

===Wall and ditch===
The castrum&#x27;s special structure also defended from attacks. The base (&quot;munimentum&quot;, &quot;fortification&quot;) was placed entirely within the &quot;vallum&quot; (&quot;wall&quot;), which could be constructed under the protection of the legion in battle formation if necessary. The &quot;vallum&quot; was quadrangular, aligned on the cardinal points of the compass. 

The construction crews dug a trench (&quot;fossa&quot;), throwing the excavated material inward, to be formed into the rampart (&quot;agger&quot;). On top of this a palisade of stakes (&quot;sudes&quot; or &quot;valli&quot;) was erected. The soldiers had to carry these stakes on the march. Over the course of time, the palisade might be replaced by a brick or stone wall, and the ditch served also as a moat. A legion-sized camp placed towers at intervals along the wall with positions between for the division artillery.

===Intervallum===
Around the inside periphery of the &quot;vallum&quot; was a clear space, the &quot;intervallum&quot;, which served to catch enemy missiles, as an access route to the &quot;vallum&quot; and as a storage space for cattle (&quot;capita&quot;) and plunder (&quot;praeda&quot;). The Romans were masters of geometry and showed it in their camps: a modern study shows that the intervallum &quot;was 1/16th of the square root of the area it enclosed in the fort.&quot;

Legionaries were quartered in a peripheral zone inside the &quot;intervallum&quot;, which they could rapidly cross to take up position on the &quot;vallum&quot;. Inside of the legionary quarters was a peripheral road, the &quot;Via Sagularis&quot;, probably a type of &quot;service road&quot;, as the &quot;sagum&quot;, a kind of cloak, was the garment of soldiers.

===Streets, gates and central plaza===


Every camp included a &quot;main street&quot;, which ran through the camp in a north–south direction and was very wide. The names of streets in many cities formerly occupied by the Romans suggest that the street was called &quot;cardo&quot; or &quot;cardus maximus&quot;. This name applies more to cities than it does to ancient camps. Typically &quot;main street&quot; was the &quot;via principalis&quot;. The central portion was used as a parade ground and headquarters area. The &quot;headquarters&quot; building was called the &quot;praetorium&quot; because it housed the &quot;praetor&quot; or base commander (&quot;first officer&quot;), and his staff. In the camp of a full legion he held the rank of &quot;consul&quot; or &quot;proconsul&quot; but officers of lesser ranks might command. On one side of the &quot;praetorium&quot; was the &quot;quaestorium&quot;, the building of the &quot;quaestor&quot; (supply officer). On the other side was the &quot;forum&quot;, a small duplicate of an urban forum, where public business could be conducted. 

The &quot;Via Principalis&quot; went through the &quot;vallum&quot; in the &quot;Porta Principalis Dextra&quot; (&quot;right principal gate&quot;) and &quot;Porta Principalis Sinistra&quot; (&quot;left, etc.&quot;), which were gates fortified with &quot;turres&quot; (&quot;towers&quot;). Which was on the north and which on the south depends on whether the praetorium faced east or west, which remains unknown. Along the &quot;Via Principalis&quot; were the homes or tents of the several tribunes in front of the barracks of the units they commanded. The central region of the &quot;Via Principalis&quot; with the buildings for the command staff was called the &quot;Principia&quot; (plural of &quot;principium&quot;). It was actually a square, as across this at right angles to the &quot;Via Principalis&quot; was the &quot;Via Praetoria&quot;, so called because the &quot;praetorium&quot; interrupted it. The &quot;Via Principalis&quot; and the &quot;Via Praetoria&quot; offered another division of the camp into four quarters.

Across the central plaza (&quot;principia&quot;) to the east or west was the main gate, the &quot;Porta Praetoria&quot;. Marching through it and down &quot;headquarters street&quot; a unit ended up in formation in front of the headquarters. The standards of the legion were located on display there, very much like the flag of modern camps. On the other side of the praetorium the &quot;Via Praetoria&quot; continued to the wall, where it went through the &quot;Porta Decumana&quot;. In theory this was the back gate. Supplies were supposed to come in through it and so it was also called, descriptively, the &quot;Porta Quaestoria&quot;. The term Decumana, &quot;of the 10th&quot;, came from the arranging of &quot;manipuli&quot; or &quot;turmae&quot; from the first to the 10th, such that the 10th was near the &quot;intervallum&quot; on that side. The &quot;Via Praetoria&quot; on that side might take the name &quot;Via Decumana&quot; or the entire &quot;Via Praetoria&quot; be replaced with &quot;Decumanus Maximus&quot;.

===Canteen===
In peaceful times the camp set up a marketplace with the natives in the area. They were allowed into the camp as far as the units numbered 5 (half-way to the praetorium). There another street crossed the camp at right angles to the &quot;Via Decumana&quot;, called the &quot;Via Quintana&quot;, (English: 5th street&quot;,&quot; from Latin: &quot;quintana&quot;, the fifth). If the camp needed more gates, one or two of the &quot;Porta Quintana&quot; were built, presumably named &quot;dextra&quot; and &quot;sinistra&quot;. If the gates were not built, the &quot;Porta Decumana&quot; also became the &quot;Porta Quintana&quot;. At &quot;Via Quintana&quot; a public market was allowed.

===Major buildings===

The &quot;Via Quintana&quot; and the &quot;Via Principalis&quot; divided the camp into three districts: the &quot;Latera Praetorii&quot;, the &quot;Praetentura&quot; and the &quot;Retentura&quot;. In the &quot;latera&quot; (&quot;sides&quot;) were the &quot;Arae&quot; (sacrificial altars), the &quot;Auguratorium&quot; (for auspices), the &quot;Tribunal&quot;, where courts martial and arbitrations were conducted (it had a raised platform), the guardhouse, the quarters of various kinds of staff and the storehouses for grain (&quot;horrea&quot;) or meat (&quot;carnarea&quot;). Sometimes the &quot;horrea&quot; were located near the barracks and the meat was stored on the hoof. Analysis of sewage from latrines indicates the legionary diet was mainly grain. Also located in the &quot;Latera&quot; was the &quot;Armamentarium&quot;, a long shed containing any heavy weapons and artillery not on the wall.
The &quot;Praetentura&quot; (&quot;stretching to the front&quot;) contained the &quot;Scamnum Legatorum&quot;, the quarters of officers who were below general but higher than company commanders (&quot;Legati&quot;). Near the &quot;Principia&quot; were the &quot;Valetudinarium&quot; (hospital), &quot;Veterinarium&quot; (for horses), &quot;Fabrica&quot; (&quot;workshop&quot;, metals and wood), and further to the front the quarters of special forces. These included &quot;Classici&quot; (&quot;marines&quot;, as most European camps were on rivers and contained a river naval command), &quot;Equites&quot; (&quot;cavalry&quot;), &quot;Exploratores&quot; (&quot;scouts&quot;), and &quot;Vexillarii&quot; (carriers of vexilla, the official pennants of the legion and its units). Troops who did not fit elsewhere also were there.

The part of the &quot;Retentura&quot; (&quot;stretching to the rear&quot;) closest to the &quot;Principia&quot; contained the &quot;Quaestorium&quot;. By the late empire it had developed also into a safekeep for plunder and a prison for hostages and high-ranking enemy captives. Near the &quot;Quaestorium&quot; were the quarters of the headquarters guard (&quot;Statores&quot;), who amounted to two centuries (companies). If the &quot;Imperator&quot; was present they served as his bodyguard.

===Barracks===
Further from the &quot;Quaestorium&quot; were the tents of the &quot;Nationes&quot; (&quot;natives&quot;), who were auxiliaries of foreign troops, and the legionaries in double rows of tents or barracks (&quot;Strigae&quot;). One &quot;Striga&quot; was as long as required and 18 m wide. In it were two &quot;Hemistrigia&quot; of facing tents centered in its 9 m strip. Arms could be stacked before the tents and baggage carts kept there as well. Space on the other side of the tent was for passage.

In the northern places like Britain, where it got cold in the winter, they would make wood or stone barracks. The Romans would also put a fireplace in the barracks. They had about three bunk beds in it. They had a small room beside it where they put their armour; it was as big as the tents. They would make these barracks if the fort they had was going to stay there for good.

A tent was 3 by 3.5 metres (0.6 m for the aisle), ten men per tent. Ideally a company took 10 tents, arranged in a line of 10 companies, with the 10th near the &quot;Porta Decumana&quot;. Of the c. 9.2 square metres of bunk space each man received 0.9, or about 0.6 by 1.5 m, which was only practical if they slept with heads to the aisle. The single tent with its men was called &quot;contubernium&quot;, also used for &quot;squad&quot;. A squad during some periods was 8 men or fewer. The &quot;centurion&quot;, or company commander, had a double-sized tent for his quarters, which served also as official company area. Other than there, the men had to find other places to be. To avoid mutiny, it was important for the officers to keep them busy.

A covered portico might protect the walkway along the tents. If barracks had been constructed, one company was housed in one barracks building, with the arms at one end and the common area at the other. The company area was used for cooking and recreation such as gaming. The army provisioned the men and had their bread (&quot;panis militaris&quot;) baked in outdoor ovens, but the men were responsible for cooking and serving themselves. They could buy meals or supplementary foods at the canteen. The officers were allowed servants.

===Sanitation===
For sanitary facilities, a camp had both public and private latrines. A public latrine consisted of a bank of seats situated over a channel of running water. One of the major considerations for selecting the site of a camp was the presence of running water, which the engineers diverted into the sanitary channels. Drinking water came from wells; however, the larger and more permanent bases featured the &quot;aqueduct&quot;, a structure running a stream captured from high ground (sometimes miles away) into the camp. The praetorium had its own latrine and probably the quarters of the high-ranking officers. In or near the &quot;intervallum&quot;, where they could easily be accessed, were the latrines of the soldiers. A public bathhouse for the soldiers, also containing a latrine, was located near or on the &quot;Via Principalis&quot;.

===Territory===
The influence of a base extended far beyond its walls. The total land required for the maintenance of a permanent base was called its &quot;territoria&quot;. In it were located all the resources of nature and the terrain required by the base: pastures, woodlots, water sources, stone quarries, mines, exercise fields and attached villages. The central castra might also support various fortified adjuncts to the main base, which were not self-sustaining as was the base. In this category were &quot;speculae&quot;, &quot;watchtowers&quot;, &quot;castella&quot;, &quot;small camps&quot;, and naval bases.

All the major bases near rivers featured some sort of fortified naval installation, one side of which was formed by the river or lake. The other sides were formed by a polygonal wall and ditch constructed in the usual way, with gates and watchtowers. The main internal features were the boat sheds and the docks. When not in use, the boats were drawn up into the sheds for maintenance and protection. Since the camp was placed to best advantage on a hill or slope near the river, the naval base was usually outside its walls. The &quot;classici&quot; and the &quot;optiones&quot; of the naval installation relied on the camp for its permanent defense. Naval personnel generally enjoyed better quarters and facilities. Many were civilians working for the military.

===Modifications in practice===
The ideal plan was typically modified to suit the terrain and the circumstances. Each camp discovered by archaeology has its own specific layout and architectural features, which makes sense from a military point of view. If, for example, the camp was built on an outcrop, it followed the lines of the outcrop. The terrain for which it was best suited and for which it was probably designed in distant prehistoric times was the rolling plain. 

The camp was best placed on the summit and along the side of a low hill, with spring water running in rivulets through the camp (&quot;aquatio&quot;) and pastureland to provide grazing (&quot;pabulatio&quot;) for the animals. In case of attack, arrows, javelins and sling missiles could be fired down at an enemy tiring himself to come up. For defence, troops could be formed in an &quot;acies&quot;, or &quot;battle-line&quot;, outside the gates where they could be easily resupplied and replenished as well as being supported by archery from the palisade.

The streets, gates and buildings present depended on the requirements and resources of the camp. The gates might vary from two to six and not be centred on the sides. Not all the streets and buildings might be present.

===Quadrangular camps in later times===
Many settlements in Europe originated as Roman military camps and still show traces of their original pattern (e.g. Castres in France, Barcelona in Spain). The pattern was also used by Spanish colonizers in America following strict rules by the Spanish monarchy for founding new cities in the New World.

Many of the towns of England still retain forms of the word &quot;castra&quot; in their names, usually as the suffixes &quot;-caster&quot;, &quot;-cester&quot; or &quot;-chester&quot; – Lancaster, Tadcaster, Worcester, Gloucester, Mancetter, Uttoxeter, Colchester, Chester, Manchester and Ribchester for example. Castle has the same derivation, from the diminutive &quot;castellum&quot; or &quot;little fort&quot;, but does not usually indicate a former Roman camp. Whitley Castle however is an exception, referring to the Roman fort of Epiacum in Northumberland.

==Camp life==
Activities conducted in a castra can be divided into ordinary and &quot;the duty&quot; or &quot;the watch&quot;. Ordinary activity was performed during regular working hours. The duty was associated with operating the installation as a military facility. For example, none of the soldiers was required to man the walls all the time, but round-the-clock duty required a portion of the soldiers to be on duty at any time.

Duty time was divided into &quot;vigilia&quot;, the eight watches into which the 24-hour day was divided so they stood guard for three hours that day. The Romans used signals on brass instruments to mark time. These were mainly the &quot;buccina&quot; or &quot;bucina&quot;, the &quot;cornu&quot; and the &quot;tuba&quot;. As they did not possess valves for regulating the pitch, the range of these instruments was somewhat limited. Nevertheless, the musicians (&quot;aenatores&quot;, &quot;brassmen&quot;) managed to define enough signals for issuing commands. The instrument used to mark the passage of a watch was the &quot;buccina&quot;, from which the trumpet derives. It was sounded by a &quot;buccinator&quot;.

===Ordinary life===
Ordinary camp life began with a &quot;buccina&quot; call at daybreak, the first watch of the day. The soldiers arose at this time and shortly after gathered in the company area for breakfast and assembly. The centurions were up before them and off to the &quot;principia&quot; where they and the &quot;equites&quot; were required to assemble. The regimental commanders, the tribunes, were already converging on the &quot;praetorium&quot;. There the general staff planned the day. At a staff meeting the &quot;tribunes&quot; received the password and the orders of the day. They brought those back to the &quot;centuriones&quot;, who returned to their company areas to instruct the men.

For soldiers, the main agendum was a vigorous training session lasting about a watch long. Recruits received two, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Planning and supervision of training were under a general staff officer, who might manage training at several camps. According to Vegetius, the men might take a hike or a jog under full pack, or swim a river. Marching drill was always in order.

Each soldier was taught the use of every weapon and also was taught to ride. Seamanship was taught at naval bases. Soldiers were generalists in the military and construction arts. They practiced archery, spear-throwing and above all swordsmanship against posts (&quot;pali&quot;) fixed in the ground. Training was taken very seriously and was democratic. Ordinary soldiers would see all the officers training with them including the &quot;praetor&quot; or the emperor if he was in camp.

Swordsmanship lessons and use of the shooting range probably took place on the &quot;campus&quot;, a &quot;field&quot; outside the &quot;castra&quot;, from which English &quot;camp&quot; derives. Its surface could be lightly paved. Winter curtailed outdoor training. The general might in that case have sheds constructed, which served as field houses for training. There is archaeological evidence in one case of an indoor equestrian ring.

Apart from the training, each soldier had a regular job on the base, of which there was a large variety from the various kinds of clerk to the craftsmen. Soldiers changed jobs frequently. The commander&#x27;s policy was to have all the soldiers skilled in all the arts and crafts so that they could be as interchangeable as possible. Even then the goal was not entirely achievable. The gap was bridged by the specialists, the &quot;optiones&quot; or &quot;chosen men&quot;, of which there were many different kinds. For example, a skilled artisan might be chosen to superintend a workshop. Soldiers were also expected to build the camp upon arrival before engaging in any sort of warfare after a day&#x27;s march.
The supply administration was run as a business using money as the medium of exchange. The aureus was the preferred coin of the late republic and early empire; in the late empire the solidus came into use. The larger bases, such as &quot;Moguntiacum&quot;, minted their own coins. As does any business, the base quaestorium required careful record keeping, performed mainly by the optiones. A chance cache of tablets from Vindolanda in Britain gives us a glimpse of some supply transactions. They record, among other things, the purchase of consumables and raw supplies, the storage and repair of clothing and other items, and the sale of items, including foodstuffs, to achieve an income. Vindolanda traded vigorously with the surrounding natives.

Another feature of the camp was the military hospital (&quot;valetudinarium&quot;, later &quot;hospitium&quot;). Augustus instituted the first permanent medical corps in the Roman army. Its physicians, the &quot;medici ordinarii&quot;, had to be qualified physicians. They were allowed medical students, practitioners and whatever orderlies they needed; i.e., the military hospitals were medical schools and places of residency as well.

Officers were allowed to marry and to reside with their families on base. The army did not extend the same privileges to the men, who were not allowed to marry. However, they often kept common law families off base in communities nearby. The communities might be native, as the tribesmen tended to build around a permanent base for purposes of trade, but also the base sponsored villages (&quot;vici&quot;) of dependents and businessmen. Dependants were not allowed to follow an army on the march into hostile territory.

Military service was for about 25 years. At the end of that time, the veteran was given a certificate of honorable discharge (&quot;honesta missio&quot;). Some of these have survived engraved on stone. Typically they certify that the veteran, his wife (one per veteran) and children or his sweetheart were now Roman citizens, which is a good indication that troops, which were used chiefly on the frontier, were from peoples elsewhere on the frontier who wished to earn Roman citizenship. However, under Antoninus Pius, citizenship was no longer granted to the children of rank-and-file veterans, the privilege becoming restricted only to officers. Veterans often went into business in the communities near a base. They became permanent members of the community and would stay on after the troops were withdrawn, as in the notable case of Saint Patrick&#x27;s family.

===Duties===
Conducted in parallel with the ordinary activities was &quot;the duty&quot;, the official chores required by the camp under strict military discipline. The &quot;legate&quot; was ultimately responsible for them as he was for the entire camp, but he delegated the duty to a tribune chosen as officer of the day. The line &quot;tribunes&quot; were commanders of &quot;cohortes&quot; and were approximately the equivalent of colonels. The six tribunes were divided into units of two, with each unit being responsible for filling the position of officer of the day for two months. The two men of a unit decided among themselves who would take what day. They could alternate days or each take a month. One filled in for the other in case of illness. On his day, the tribune effectively commanded the camp and was even respected as such by the &quot;legate&quot;.

The equivalent concept of the duties performed in modern camps is roughly the detail. The responsibilities (&quot;curae&quot;) of the many kinds of detail were distributed to the men by all the methods considered fair and democratic: lot, rotation and negotiation. Certain kinds of &quot;cura&quot; were assigned certain classes or types of troops; for example, wall sentries were chosen only from &quot;velites&quot;. Soldiers could be temporarily or permanently exempted: the &quot;immunes&quot;. For example, a triarius was &quot;immunis&quot; from the &quot;curae&quot; of the hastati.

The duty year was divided into time slices, typically one or two months, which were apportioned to units, typically maniples or centuries. They were always allowed to negotiate who took the duty and when. The most common kind of &quot;cura&quot; were the posts of the sentinels, called the &quot;excubiae&quot; by day and the &quot;vigilae&quot; at night. Wall posts were &quot;praesidia&quot;, gate posts, &quot;custodiae&quot;, advance positions before the gates, &quot;stationes&quot;. In addition were special guards and details. One post was typically filled by four men, one sentinel and the others at ease until a situation arose or it was their turn to be sentinel. Some of the details were:
*guarding, cleaning and maintaining the &quot;principia&quot;.
*guarding and maintaining the quarters of each tribune.
*tending the horses of each cavalry &quot;turma&quot;.
*guarding the &quot;praetorium&quot;.

<text>Ruby Pearl Elzy (February 20, 1908 – June 26, 1943) was an American operatic soprano. She appeared on stage and in films. She recorded on albums before her death in her 30s from surgery to remove a benign tumor.

==Family and early life==
Elzy was born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, and educated at Rust College, the Ohio State University (graduating in 1930) and the Juilliard School (graduating in 1934). At Juilliard she was a pupil of Lucia Dunham. Her sister Amanda Elzy (died 2004) was a prominent educator after whom Amanda Elzy High School in Greenwood, Mississippi is named. Their mother Emma Elzy (died 1985, aged 98) was a teacher and prominent member of the Methodist church, in whose memory the Mississippi Conference of the United Methodist Church presents an annual Emma K. Elzy award. Ruby had two sisters, Amanda and Beatrice Wayne and one brother, Robert. Their father Charlie abandoned the family when Ruby was five.

==Professional accomplishments==
Elzy entertained at the White House, December 15, 1937, for First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt&#x27;s luncheon for the wives of U.S. Supreme Court Justices. She appeared on Broadway in the musical &quot;John Henry&quot;, in films, on radio and on the concert stage. She appeared with Paul Robeson in the 1933 film &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot;, and also with Bing Crosby and Mary Martin in &quot;Birth of the Blues&quot;, though neither of these were starring roles. She sang at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater and in the Hollywood Bowl.

Elzy created the role of Serena in George Gershwin&#x27;s folk opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; and performed in it more than eight hundred times. Serena sings the heart-wrenching soprano aria and lament &quot;My Man&#x27;s Gone Now&quot; after her husband Robbin is murdered during a game of craps. But fellow cast member and lead soprano Anne Brown (who occupied the role of Bess) and not Elzy is actually heard singing the aria on the 1940 original cast album of selections from &quot;Porgy and Bess.&quot; Fortunately, Elzy sang the demanding aria on the 1937 CD release of the &quot;Gershwin Memorial Concert&quot; that took place at the Hollywood Bowl three months after the composer&#x27;s death .

==Legacy==
In 1940, she was chosen by composer Harold Arlen to record the world premiere of his original suite of Negro spirituals, &quot;Reverend Johnson&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which would be her only commercial recording. During the same year Ruby married Jack Carr, an actor/singer who appeared on stage with her in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;. The marriage lasted until her death.

Elzy rose above poverty and prejudice to become one of the most acclaimed singers of her generation, but her career lasted barely a decade. Just as she was reaching the peak of her powers as a singer and about to achieve her greatest dream—to star in the title role of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot;—and one week after her final performance as Serena, Ruby Elzy died in Detroit following surgery to remove a benign tumor. She was 35 years old.

In 2006, Elzy&#x27;s biographer, David E. Weaver, produced a first-ever CD compilation of Elzy, featuring the singer in twenty rare recorded and broadcast performances. The CD, entitled &quot;Ruby Elzy in Song,&quot; was released on the Cambria label.

*&quot;Birth of the Blues&quot; (1941)

<text>Thorncliffe Park is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in the former Borough of East York.

The City of Toronto recognizes Thorncliffe Park&#x27;s boundaries as the Don River on the south side; Leaside Bridge, Millwood Road, and Laird Drive on the west side; the West Don River on the east side; and Eglinton Avenue East on the north side.

==History==


Thorncliffe Park is named for Thorn Cliff House, the first Toronto home of the industrious 19th century Taylor family. The house was located on 82 acres of farmland that British settler John Taylor purchased in 1831 at the Forks of the Don Valley, in present-day E.T. Seton Park. Thorn Cliff remained the family home until 1888 and was demolished in the 1940s. Taylor purchased the land from Samuel Sinclair. It was originally farmed by Parshall Terry, with settlement records for Thorncliffe Park going back to 1800, just seven years after the founding of the Town of York.

With growing business interests in horse and cattle breeding, farming, lumbering, and milling throughout the mid-19th century, John Taylor’s sons increased the family’s land holdings to thousands of acres in the Don Valley and surrounding table lands. This included all the land between the future Leslie Street and Don Valley Parkway, to a half mile north of Eglinton Avenue East, including the future Flemingdon Park. Six hundred acres of this land became known as Thorn Cliff Farm.

By 1888, a prominent Toronto businessperson and Taylor son-in-law named Robert T. Davies had purchased 600 acres of land including the original family home, Thorn Cliff. Davies founded Thorncliffe Stock Farm, sometimes referred to as Thorncliffe Stable, which became a world-famous facility for breeding Clydesdales, standardbreds, and the largest thoroughbred stable in Canada. 
Davies’s sons relocated the stables to Thornhill, Ontario after selling a significant portion of the farm in 1920 to American investors to operate a racetrack, doing business under the name Thorncliffe Park Racing and Breeding Association Ltd. 

The racetrack was home to thoroughbred horse racing and harness racing from 1917 until 1952 when it was sold for real estate development. Today, the old racetrack site is commemorated by two streets named Grandstand Place and Milepost Place and the number of buildings that took on racetrack stable names like Churchill, Maple Glen and Wellow Glen.

The Thorncliffe Ski Jump, located west of the present day Ontario Science Centre, was opened by the Toronto Ski Club in January 1934 and operated until February 1941. Its last recorded event raised funds for the Canadian Red Cross and Norwegian War Aid Fund during World War II.
In the 1950s, developers tore down the racetrack and created one of Toronto&#x27;s first high-rise neighbourhoods. The neighbourhood embodies some standard urban planning ideas of the era – high concentrations of similar housing types, strict separation of retail and residential development, and the assumption that everyone has a car. Low-rise buildings are clustered inside the enclosure created by Thorncliffe Park and Overlea, while high-rise buildings line the outside of Thorncliffe Park. Retail establishments were concentrated in a single shopping mall, now called the East York Town Centre, between the two arms of Thorncliffe Park Drive at Overlea Boulevard. Smaller retail and service plazas have recently opened along Overlea Boulevard. Many residents on Thorncliffe Park Drive are at considerable walking distance from shops, although this problem is mitigated somewhat, even in winter, by well kept sidewalks and walkways and by frequent bus service.

===Street names===
Some of Thorncliffe Park&#x27;s street names commemorate a former racetrack located there, or recognize the Town of Leaside&#x27;s role in the development of the new community.

* Leaside Park Drive – named in 1966, six months before the Town of Leaside&#x27;s amalgamation into the Borough of East York.
* Beth Nealson Drive – named after Beth Nealson, the last mayor of the Town of Leaside.
* William Morgan Drive – named for Leaside&#x27;s reeve from 1948 to 1950.
* Banigan Drive – named for an elected member of Town of Leaside&#x27;s Council from 1951 to 1955. Banigan was defeated by Charles H. Hiscott in the 1955 election to replace retiring mayor Howard Burrell.
* Pat Moore Drive – named for a Thorncliffe Park resident and community advocate. 
* Patriarch Bartholomew Way – recognizes the Toronto visit of the spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Christians, Bartholomew I of Constantinople.

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 Census, Thorncliffe Park has a population of 21,108, a 9.79% increase from 2011. The top 10 non-English mother tongues are Urdu (24.4%), Pashto (5.1%), Tagalog (Filipino) (4.7%), Persian (4.6%), Gujarati (4.1%), Arabic (3.5%), Bengali (2%), Greek (1.5%), Punjabi (1.4%), and Spanish (1.4%).
According to the 2016 Census, Thorncliffe Park is an extremely diverse community, with the vast majority of its residents being Visible minorities, with many being immigrants. Just under one-third, 32%, of Thorncliffe Park residents were born in Canada, and over 18% of Thorncliffe Park residents immigrated into Canada between 2011 and 2016.

Pakistani, Indian and Afghan Canadians make up 21%, 17.6% and 8.8% of the neighbourhood&#x27;s population, respectively. 

In 2016, 46.6% of residents identified as South Asian, 20.5% identified as White Canadian, 8.45% identified as West Asian Canadians, 7.1% identified as Filipino Canadians, 5.2% identified as Black Canadians, 3.2% identified as Arab Canadians, 2.04% identified as Chinese Canadians, 1.42% identified as Latin American Canadians and 0.6% identified as Korean Canadians.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Public Transportation====
Toronto Transit Commission buses operate in the community. When the new Line 5 Eglinton line opens, the 81 Thorncliffe Park and 88 South Leaside buses will connect to Science Centre Station and Laird Station, respectively. Thorncliffe Park Station will be a new stop on the Ontario Line, expected to open in 2030. Metrolinx is also building a maintenance and storage facility in the neighbourhood. The project requires the relocation of culturally-significant amenities and services, resulting in community members calling for a redesign of the project locally.

====Roads====
The Overlea Bridge, formally known as the Charles H. Hiscott Bridge, was built in 1960 to cross the west branch of the Don River and connect Overlea Boulevard to Don Mills Road, linking Thorncliffe Park to Flemingdon Park. The bridge was named for former mayor of Leaside Charles Henry Hiscott (1956 to 1961). 
Reconstruction is planned for the 2022-2025 period as part of the Renewing Overlea Boulevard project and will included widened sidewalks, the addition of cycle tracks and public art.

==Education==
Schools operated by the Toronto District School Board in Thorncliffe Park include Thorncliffe Park Public School, Fraser Mustard Early Learning Academy, Valley Park Middle School, and Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute.

==Recreation==

Toronto Parks, Forestry &amp; Recreation (PF&amp;R) manages the Jenner Jean-Marie Community Centre and is responsible for the maintenance of R.V. Burgess Park, Leaside Park and Outdoor Pool, and E.T. Seton Park, which is a part of the Toronto Ravine System. The Thorncliffe branch of the Toronto Public Library operates in the neighbourhood. Leaside Park is home to the Thorncliffe Park Tennis Club.

==In culture==

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the second collection of hit songs by the band, albeit shorter than the previous release, &quot;Nothing Safe: Best of the Box&quot;. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on November 30, 2005.
It was the last album released by Alice in Chains before the death of singer Layne Staley in 2002. Mike Starr plays bass on the album&#x27;s first five songs, while Mike Inez plays bass on the last five.

==Album cover==
The album featured two covers. The first cover features a photo of boxer Gene Fullmer receiving a crushing right from Neal Rivers during their 10-round bout at Madison Square Garden on November 15, 1957. The unofficial second cover features an image of the members of the band&#x27;s heads from the &quot;Facelift&quot; photoshoot without the text on the cover.

==Reception==

The album received a mixed reception from critics, with reviewers criticizing the lack of songs and &quot;Cash grab&quot; nature of the album. AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Huey called the album &quot;a lower-priced, ten-track sampler of Alice in Chains&#x27; career.&quot; Bill Adams of Ground Control Magazine questioned the integrity of the album, writing in his review &quot;one has to wonder who this compilation was made for. When it was released in 2001, Alice in Chains had only gone for about six years without a new studio album, and fans had been kept interested with live albums, box sets, and myriad other releases, so why put out something so plainly utilitarian?&quot;.

<text>Isaac Campbell Kidd Jr. (August 14, 1919 – June 27, 1999) was an American admiral in the United States Navy who served as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet, and also as commander in chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet from 1975 to 1978. He was the son of Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, who was killed on the bridge of the battleship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

In 1978 Kidd was among a number of retired four-star officers who testified before Congress in favor of the controversial SALT II arms control pact.

==Biography==
===Graduation===
Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Kidd graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1941; he was commissioned an ensign on December19, 1941, just 12 days after his father was killed aboard his flagship. As &quot;Time&quot; described the event, when Kidd received his commission as ensign &quot;the U.S. Naval Academy and its guests broke into a thunderous cheer— an unprecedented demonstration in honor of Ensign Kidd and his father.&quot; During World War II he served as a gunnery and operations officer on destroyers in both Europe and the Pacific, and participated in various Allied landings in the Mediterranean as well as at Iwo Jima.

===Naval service===
His 23 years at sea during his 37-year naval career included 15 years in command of destroyers, destroyer divisions and squadrons and three U.S. fleets in the Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean; he also served as executive assistant and senior aide to the Chief of Naval Operations in the early 1960s, earning citations for his efforts in the Cuban Missile Crisis and several other crises. In 1967, he was chosen by his friend and colleague Admiral John S. McCain Jr. to head the Naval Court of Inquiry into the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident during the Six-Day War in June of that year. The Inquiry quickly became controversial amid allegations of a cover-up from both &quot;Liberty&quot; survivors and high-ranking Navy officers. The allegations concern the deliberateness of the Israeli attack and the suppression of evidence that would prove this. Captain Ward Boston, Admiral Kidd’s chief legal counsel, corroborated many of these claims in a 2004 affidavit. He also claimed that the entire Inquiry was a sham meant to exonerate Israel: “I know from personal conversations I had with Admiral Kidd that President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack was a case of “mistaken identity” despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.” From 1975 to 1978, Kidd served as Commander in Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet.

===Retirement===
Shortly after his 1978 retirement, Kidd was among a number of retired four-star officers who testified before Congress in favor of the controversial SALT II arms control pact. Kidd declared that while he was not entirely thrilled with the proposed treaty&#x27;s verification procedures, &quot;the alternative of having no ceiling at all, considering our position at this point in the so-called race, I find totally unacceptable.&quot;

He also taught the law of the sea at the College of William and Mary. His six children included Navy Captain Isaac C. KiddIII.

Kidd died of cancer at age 79 at his home in Alexandria, Virginia, and was buried in the Naval Academy Cemetery.

<text>Benny Silman of New York City is a former student turned campus bookmaker who was jailed for masterminding a point shaving scandal at Arizona State University.

==Career==
In 1998, Silman pleaded guilty to charges that he bribed college basketball players Stevin &quot;Hedake&quot; Smith and Isaac Burton to ensure the Sun Devils did not &quot;cover the allotted spread&quot; in four end-of-season basketball games during the 1994 season. He was sentenced to just under four years in a federal prison after pleading guilty to fixing Arizona State basketball games in exchange for money from gamblers. A total of $568,000 was wagered by professional sports handicappers on the approval of Silman.

Following his release in 2002, Silman has conducted seminars with NCAA athletes to warn them about the dangers of gambling and has written articles for such publications as Maxim magazine. Silman claims that he was coerced into perpetuating his scheme longer than planned by members of organized crime. His story was made into a movie titled &quot;Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie&quot; with David Krumholtz playing Silman.

<doc id="678770" wikidata="Q558352" url="?curid=678770" title="Phacoemulsification">
<text>Phacoemulsification is a cataract surgery method in which the internal lens of the eye which has developed a cataract is emulsified with the tip of an ultrasonic handpiece and aspirated from the eye. Aspirated fluids are replaced with irrigation of balanced salt solution to maintain the volume of the anterior chamber during the procedure. This procedure minimises the incision size and reduces the recovery time and risk of surgery-induced astigmatism.

It is best suited to relatively soft cataracts, where the ultrasonic energy required is moderate, and insertion of foldable intraocular prosthetic lenses, which take advantage of the small incision possible. It is the most common procedure for cataract removal in the developed world, with an excellent prognosis in uncomplicated cases.

==Etymology==
The term originated from phaco- (Greek &quot;phako-&quot;, comb. form of &quot;phakós&quot;, lentil; see ) + emulsification.

==Contraindications==

The same general contraindications for cataract surgery apply. Specific contraindications for phacoemulsification include hard or dense cataracts where phacoemulsification is likely to cause permanent damage to the cornea.

==Mechanism==

The phacoemulsification system comprises three sub-systems: Ultrasound, aspiration, and irrigation.

===Ultrasound===
The ultrasound component is used to break the lens down into particles small enough to be aspirated through the suction passages around the tip, which allows a very small incision for access. The incision is small enough that sutures are not needed for closure, and very little astigmatism is caused by healing of the wound in the cornea.

The phacoemulsification handpiece has a tip which vibrates longitudinally at a frequency in the range of 27 to 60 kHz, with a stroke length of 60 to 150 micrometres. Power is adjustable by the operator as a percentage of full power, and indicates a variation in nominal stroke length. Actual stroke length may vary slightly depending on the density of the material it contacts, though some instruments use feedback to maintain nominal stroke by adjusting current, voltage or frequency. Nominal frequency is not adjustable. Both efficiency and heat generation are increased with higher frequency, and 40 kHz is considered a good compromise and is in common use.

Most handpieces use piezoelectric crystals and the rest use magnetostrictive materials to generate the vibration.

The handpiece is hollow and usually accommodates an aspiration line, and the vibratory transducer components are sealed into it. The handpiece is designed and constructed to be autoclaved between uses.

The phaco tip is available in a variety of configurations, including a selection of tip angles to suit lens removal technique. Standard tip angles range between straight and 60 degrees, and more complex tips may have compound angles. The end of the tip may be round, ellipsoid, bent or flared. A variety of designs are intended to enhance cooling and irrigation, and to prevent burns.

There are three hypothesised mechanisms of how the nuclear material is emulsified. One proposes that the tip acts as a chisel and removes material on the forward stroke, another proposes that ultrasonic energy is somehow involved, and the third proposes that the tip causes microcavitation bubbles on the retraction stroke, which collapse to exert high pressures on the materials very close to the bubble, which cause them to disintegrate.

===Aspiration===
The aspiration system is used to remove the emulsified lens tissue as it is broken down by the tip. This may be done through the handpiece, with the inlet orifice around the vibrating tip. or through a separate aspiration tip, inserted through a smaller incision.

The pump of the phacoemulsification system can be a peristaltic type or a vacuum transfer type. In peristaltic pumps aspiration flow rate and vacuum are independent. Vacuum is the suction force which holds cataract nuclear fragments against the phaco tip so that they can be emulsified, and draws the emulsion into the tip. Vacuum is the relative low pressure generated by the pump removing liquids and gas from the suction side, and the pressure difference between the vacuum pump reservoir and the ambient pressure at the inlet to the tip of the handpiece draws fluids through the aspiration ducting. When the inlet is occluded by solid material, such as a cataract fragment, the pressure difference holds the solid in contact with the tip while the ultrasonic vibration breaks up the solid to fragments small enough to pass into the aspiration ducting and be carried away by a current of ambient fluid, which must be replaced as fast as it is removed, to retain internal pressure and shape of the eye.

===Irrigation===
The three purposes of irrigation are to maintain intraocular pressure, carry lens particles out of the eye in the aspiration system,and to cool the phaco handpiece. Gravity feed of 650mm water column (75.5mm Hg) is typical. At this supply pressure, fluid enters the anterior chamber at a rate proportional to the rate at which it leaves due to aspiration and leakage. The pressure head is adjusted to suit anatomical variations and the health of the eye. Complications are less likely if the volume and pressure of the globe are maintained during surgery. This requires a balance between fluid input and output, which is a balance between irrigation, aspiration and leakage. Repeated partial collapses of the anterior chamber, and iris fluttering during removal of the nucleus are signs of inadequate fluid supply, which can be adjusted by changing the height of the gravity feed supply bottle. A height of 650mm above the eye is usually enough to compensate outflow almost immediately. During emulsification, the abrupt variations in flow at the start and end of emulsification of each fragment can cause fluctuations in volume and pressure, which can be corrected by control of the aspiration foot pedal.

Sleeves for the phaco tip are standard accessories to insulate the wound surface from heat generated by the ultrasonic energy, and provide a route for irrigation.

==Preparation and precautions==
===Anaesthesia===
Proper anesthesia is essential for ocular surgery. 
A facial nerve block may occasionally be performed to reduce lid squeezing. General anesthesia is recommended for children, traumatic eye injuries with cataract, for very apprehensive or uncooperative patients and animals. Cardiovascular monitoring is preferable in local anesthesia and is mandatory with general anesthesia.

Either topical, sub-tenon, , or retrobulbar local anaesthesia is used, usually causing the patient little or no discomfort. Topical anaesthetics are most commonly used; these are placed on the globe of the eye as eyedrops before surgery or in the globe during surgery. Local-anaesthetic injection techniques include sub-conjunctival injections and injections behind the globe (retrobulbar block) to block regional nerves and prevent eye movement. Intravenous sedation may be combined with the local anaesthetic.

===Site preparation===
Proper sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery, including use of antiseptics like povidone-iodine. Sterile drapes, gowns and gloves are employed. A plastic sheet with a receptacle helps collect the fluids during phacoemulsification. An eye speculum is inserted to keep the eyelids open. The operation site is prepared by disinfection of the area around the eye and any other exposed area of the face, and exposure of the eyeball using an eyelid speculum;

==Surgical technique==
The surgical procedure is typically performed under an operating microscope.

===Incision===
Before the phacoemulsification can be performed, one or more incisions are made in the eye to allow access for the surgical instruments. Entry into the eye is made through a minimal incision; the incision for cataract surgery has evolved along with the techniques for cataract removal and IOL placement. In phacoemulsification, the size depends on the requirements for IOL insertion. A more-posterior incision simplifies wound closure and decreases induced astigmatism but is more likely to damage blood vessels. With foldable IOLs, it is sometimes possible to use incisions smaller than . The shape, position, and size of the incision affect the capacity for self sealing, the tendency to induce astigmatism, and the surgeon&#x27;s ability to manoeuvre instruments through the opening. One or two smaller side-port incisions at 60-to-90 degrees from the main incision may be needed to access the anterior chamber with additional instruments.

====Coaxial====
Coaxial phacoemulsification uses a single probe to irrrigate, emulsify and aspirate, which is operated through a single incision.

====Bimanual====
Bimanual phacoemulsification uses one probe to emulsify and aspirate, and a second that is only used for irrigation.
===Maintaining the eye shape===
Ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs), also known as viscoelastics, are injected into the anterior chamber to support, stabilize, and protect the eyeball to help maintain eye shape and volume during the procedure, and to distend the lens capsule during IOL implantation.

OVDs are used to protect the corneal endothelium from mechanical trauma and to maintain volume and form of the intraocular space during an open incision. The OVD is introduced into the space by syringe through a cannula.

Intraocular pressure is maintained by the irrigation with BSS, which is either done through the phaco handpiece, or through a separate cannula. The tendency is for a single phaco handpiece to be used, containing the ultrasonic tip, irrigation nozzle and aspiration intake clustered at the tip. The tip is inserted through the OVD, which reduces the loss by outflow at the incision, and this is further limited by small clearance around the tip where it passes through the cornea. Pressure is controlled by elevation of the saline bag above the level of the eye.

===Capsulorhexis===

To remove a cataract by extracapsular techniques, the capsule of the lens must be opened. In earlier intracapsular cataract extraction, the whole lens and capsule was removed at the same time. This was done to prevent the inflammatory response to leftover lens material. Since it was all removed &quot;en-bloc&quot;, there was no residual lens material. With effective aspiration practically all the material can be removed while leaving the posterior capsule membrane intact. This provides a barrier between the front and back chambers of the eye, and prevents the vitreous from moving forwards. It also provides the intraocular lens implant with the ideal place to be located in the eye, away from contact with other structures yet securely held in place.

The surgeon removes the anterior face of the capsule that contains the lens inside the eye, tearing a circular opening in the front surface of the lens capsule to access the lens within. A continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is usually used to create a round, smooth-edged opening through which the lens nucleus can be removed or emulsified and the intraocular lens implant inserted. When done correctly, a CCC does not have any edge notches, and forces applied to the capsule during surgery are better distributed and less likely to result in a tear.

The usual method is to use a bent needle to begin a tear in the capsule, and then guide the edge of the tear around the anterior surface with either the same needle or Utratas forceps. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, and most surgeons will use both instruments as the situation requires.

===Preparation of the lens for emulsification===
At this point, there are options. Either the nucleus can be separated from the cortex by hydrodissection and hydrodelineation, and then broken up, or the whole lens can be broken up in situ by the prechopping technique. The fragments are removed by emuslification and aspiration.

==== Prechopping====
Cracking or prechop is sometimes used to break up the cataract before emulsification for more efficient fragment emulsification. Several methods can be used, based on the choice of instruments available and preference of the surgeon. Some are simple and do not require special or expensive equipment. In some methods a second steel instrument called a &quot;chopper&quot; is used from a side port (auxiliary incision) to help with breaking the nucleus into smaller pieces. The cataract is usually broken into two or four pieces before each piece is emulsified and aspirated.

The use of a modified cytostome with a Nagahara chopper is well suited to moderate density nuclei, and with experience can be used for soft or hard nuclei and through small pupils, but is less suitable for brunescent cataracts and loose capsules with zonular dialysis.

Other methods include bimanual twin instruments approaches for counter chopping, such as use of a cross-action cracking forceps, two modified cystotomes for middle prechop, the Fukasaku hydrochopping cannula, the Escaf ultrasonic ultrachopper, and the femtosecond laser. These prechop techniques allow surgeons to bypass the sculpting and chopping steps to fracture the nucleus, but require additional special instruments.

The is an ultrasonically powered blade similar to a phacoemulsifier needle but with a flattened blade which can be attached to the phaco handpiece. The mechanical action of the blade is augmented by the vibrations to cut hard and fibrous nuclear material easily. Tips van be selected to suit the cataract hardness.

====Hydrodissection====
When hydrodissection is used, the cataract&#x27;s outer (cortical) layer is then separated from the capsule by a gentle, continuous flow or pulsed dose of liquid from a cannula, which is injected under the anterior capsular flap along the edge of the capsulorhexis opening. In hydrodelineation, fluid is injected into the body of the lens through the cortex against the nucleus of the cataract, which separates the hardened nucleus from the softer cortex shell by flowing along the interface between them. The smaller hard nucleus can then be more-easily emulsified. The posterior cortex serves as a buffer, protecting the posterior capsule membrane. The smaller size of the separated nucleus requires shallower and less-peripheral grooving, and produces smaller fragments after cracking or chopping. The posterior cortex also maintains the shape of the capsule, which reduces the risk of posterior capsule rupture.

===Emulsification of the cataract=== 
Nucleus emulsification makes it possible to aspirate the particles through a very small incision. After removing all hard central lens nucleus material by emulsification, the softer outer lens cortex is removed with suction only.

After nuclear cracking or chopping (if needed), the cataract is emulsified and aspirated. The nucleus or fragments of the nucleus are held against the phaco tip by suction while the ultrasonic tip emulsifies the material in front of it. The resulting slurry is aspirated through the tip. This may be interrupted as necessary to reposition the tip or access another fragment. This process is continued until all of the nucleus has been removed.

The remaining lens cortex (outer layer of lens) material from the capsular bag is also carefully aspirated, using an irrigation-aspiration phaco probe or a bimanual system, while leaving the posterior capsule intact. If considered necessary, the remaining epithelial cells from the capsule are removed by capsular polishing.

Capsular polishing is the removal of lens epithelial cells remaining in the capsule after cataract removal. Capsule opacification can occur when these cells divide and form fibers. The capsular bag can be polished using metallic scrapers, silicone scrapers, Rentsch capsule curettes, an irrigation/aspiration tip, or the ultrasound irrigation/aspiration tip. A 1994 study found that the cleanest capsules were obtained by polishing with the ultrasound irrigation/aspiration tip.

===Lens insertion===

As with other cataract removal procedures, an intraocular lens implant (IOL) is usually placed into the remaining lens capsule (&quot;in-the-bag&quot; implantation). For implanting a rigid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOL, the incision has to be enlarged, so this is not usually done. For implanting a foldable IOL, the incision does not have to be enlarged. The foldable IOL, made of silicone or acrylic of appropriate power, is folded either using a holder/folder, or a proprietary insertion device provided along with the IOL. Because a smaller incision is sufficient, no stitches should be needed, and recovery time is usually shorter when using a foldable IOL.

Aligning the IOL in the correct axis to counteract astigmatism is necessary for a toric IOL. Sometimes, a ciliary sulcus implantation may be required because of posterior capsular tears or because of zonular dialysis.

===Removal of OVDs===

At the end of the procedure, OVDs that were injected to stabilize the anterior chamber, protect the cornea from damage, and distend the cataract&#x27;s capsule during IOL implantation are removed from the eye to prevent post-operative viscoelastic glaucoma, a severe intra-ocular pressure increase. This is done via suction from the irrigation-aspiration instrument and replacement by buffered saline solution (BSS). Removal of OVDs from behind the implant reduces the risk and magnitude of postoperative pressure spikes or capsular distention.

===Wound sealing=== 
In the final step, the wound is sealed by elevating the pressure inside the globe with BSS, which presses the internal tissue against the external tissue of the incision, holding the incision closed. This should be sufficient to hold the wound closed and make a watertight seal, but if this does not achieve a satisfactory seal, a suture may be added. The wound is then hydrated with BSS, which causes corneal epithelial cells to expand and compress each other and helps seal the wound. The seal can be tested by drying the surface around it and pressing on the cornea.

===Contingency procedures===
Sometimes a change from a phacoemulsification procedure to extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) may be necessary. This may occur in the event of posterior capsule rupture, zonular dehiscence, or a dropped nucleus with a nuclear fragment more than half the size of the cataract; problematic capsulorhexis with a hard cataract; or a very dense cataract where phacoemulsification is likely to cause permanent damage to the cornea.

==Complications==

Complications can develop during and after surgery.

===During surgery===
Posterior capsular rupture, a tear in the posterior capsule of the natural lens, is the most-common complication during cataract surgery. Posterior capsule rupture can cause lens fragments to be retained, corneal oedema, and cystoid macular oedema; it is also associated with increased risk of endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.

Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a rare complication.

Intraoperative floppy iris syndrome has an incidence of around 0.5% to 2.0%. Iris or ciliary body injury has an incidence of about 0.6%-1.2%. In the event of a posterior capsule rupture, fragments of the nucleus can find their way through the tear into the vitreous chamber; this is called posterior dislocation of nuclear fragments.

Other complications include failure to aspirate all lens fragments, leaving some in the anterior chamber; and incisional burns caused by overheating of the phacoemulsification tip.

===After surgery===
Complications after cataract surgery are relatively uncommon. Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) may occur but does not directly threaten vision.

Some people develop a posterior capsular opacification (PCO), also called an after-cataract. This may compromise visual acuity, and can usually be safely and painlessly corrected using a laser. to create a clear central visual axis. 
Patients who have had cataract surgery are at an increased risk of developing rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)—the most-common form of retinal detachment. Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), a non-infectious inflammatory condition, may occur following cataract surgery.

Endophthalmitis is a serious infection of the intraocular tissues, usually following intraocular surgery complications or penetrating trauma, and one of the most-severe. It is rare in cataract surgery due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Hypopyon occurs about 80% of the time.

Glaucoma may occur and may be very difficult to control. It is usually associated with inflammation, especially when small fragments or chunks of the nucleus access the vitreous cavity.

Mechanical pupillary block can occur when contact between the edge of the pupil and an adjacent structure blocks the flow of aqueous through the pupil. This is more frequent as a complication of anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, but has been known to occasionally occur with posterior IOL implantation.

Swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina, results in macular oedema and can occur a few days or weeks after surgery. Most such cases can be successfully treated. Uveitis–glaucoma–hyphema syndrome is a complication caused by the mechanical irritation of a mis-positioned IOL over the iris, ciliary body or iridocorneal angle.

Other possible complications include Elevated intraocular pressure; swelling or oedema of the cornea; displacement or dislocation of the IOL implant (rare); unplanned high refractive error—either myopic or hypermetropic—due to error in the ultrasonic biometry (measurement of the eye length and calculation of the required intraocular lens power); cyanopsia, in which the patient&#x27;s vision tinted blue and often occurs for a few days, weeks or months after removal of a cataract; and floaters, which commonly appear after surgery.

==Recovery and rehabilitation==
Following cataract surgery, side-effects such as grittiness, watering, blurred vision, double vision or a red or bloodshot eye may occur, and will usually clear after a few days. Full recovery can take four-to-six weeks. Patients are usually advised to avoid getting water in the eye during the first week after surgery, and to avoid swimming for two-to-three weeks as a conservative approach, to minimise risk of bacterial infection. Most patients can return to normal activities the day after phacoemulsification surgery. Patients should avoid driving for at least 24 hours after the surgery, largely due to possible swelling affecting focus, and pupil dilation causing excessive glare. At the first post-operative check, the surgeon will usually assess whether vision is suitable for driving.

With small-incision self-sealing wounds used with phacoemulsification, some of the post-operative restrictions common with intracapsular and extracapsular procedures are not relevant. Restrictions against lifting and bending were intended to reduce the risk of the wound opening, because straining increases intraocular pressure. With a self-sealing tunnel incision, however, higher pressure closes the wound more tightly. Routine use of a shield is not usually required because inadvertent finger pressure on the eye should not open a correctly structured incision, which should only open to point pressure. After surgery, to prevent contamination, the eyes should not be rubbed and the use of eye makeup, face cream or lotions should be avoided. Excessive dust, wind, pollen or dirt should also be avoided. Sunglasses should be worn on bright days because the eyes will be more sensitive to bright light for a while.

Topical anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics are commonly used in the form of eye-drops to reduce the risk of inflammation and infection. A shield or eye-patch may be prescribed to protect the eye while sleeping. The eye will be checked to ensure the IOL remains in place, and once it has fully stabilised, after about six weeks, vision tests will be used to check whether prescription lenses are needed. Where the focal length of the IOL is optimised for distance vision, reading glasses will generally be needed for near focus.

In some cases, the patient is dissatisfied with the optical correction provided by the initial implants, and removal and replacement is necessary. This can occur with more-complex IOL designs when patient expectations do not match with the compromises inherent in these designs, or the patient cannot accommodate the difference in distance and near-focusing of monovision lenses. The patient should not participate in contact or extreme sports or similar activities until cleared to do so by the eye surgeon.

==Outcomes==

After full recovery, visual acuity depends on the underlying condition of the eye, the choice of IOL, and any long-term complications associated with the surgery. More than 90% of operations are successful in restoring useful vision, with a low complication rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 80% of eyes should have a presenting visual acuity of 6/6 to 6/18 (20/20 to 20/60) after surgery, which is considered a good visual outcome, and that with best correction this should be at least 90%. Acuity of between 6/18 and 6/60 (20/60 to 20/200) is regarded as borderline, and worse than 6/60 (20/200) is considered poor. Borderline or poor visual outcomes are usually due to pre-surgery conditions such as glaucoma, macular disease, and diabetic retinopathy.

A ten-year prospective survey on refractive outcomes from a UK National Health Service (NHS) cataract surgery service from 2006 to 2016 showed a mean absolute error between the targeted and outcome refraction of 0.50 dioptres, with a standard deviation of 0.67. 88.76% were within one diopter of target refraction and 62.36% within 0.50 dioptres.

In a 2009 study in Sweden, factors that affected predicted refraction error included sex, preoperative visual acuity, and glaucoma, and other eye diseases. Second-eye surgery, macular degeneration, age, and diabetes did not affect predicted outcome. Prediction error decreased with time, which is likely due to the use of improved equipment and techniques, including more-accurate biometry. An American survey of nearly two million bilateral cataract surgery patients published in 2013 found immediate sequential bilateral cataract surgery was statistically associated with worse visual outcomes than for delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery; the difference was small and may not be clinically relevant.

==History==

Charles Kelman and Anton Banko introduced phacoemulsification in 1967. Kelman had the idea to use ultrasonic vibrations after being inspired by his dentist&#x27;s ultrasonic probe and collaborated with Banko who designed the first phacoemulsifier.

This method of surgery decreased the need for an extended hospital stay and made out-patient surgery the standard. Patients who undergo phacoemulsification rarely complain of pain or discomfort, although those who have topical anaesthesia rather than peribulbar block anaesthesia may experience some discomfort during the procedure.

A method of pre-chopping the cataract using the same bent cystotome needle used for capsulorhexis and a Nagahara chopper was described by Takayuki Akahoshi in 1998.

Recent advances in phacoemulsification technology involve combining the ultrasonic and irrigation-aspiration sleeve into a single handpiece with disposable tip sleeves. This design reduces manufacturing costs, eliminates the risk of infection and provides better surgical outcomes.

==Research==
Use of ultrasound in phacoemulsification can cause effects such as corneal edema, and macular edema after surgery. However, in some cases, use of ultrasound energy does not generate macular edema. The cause of macular edema in phacoemulsification is intraocular pressure fluctuation during surgery. Intraocular fluctuation can create micro bubbles and generate micro emboli in macular vessels that can cause micro ischemia in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

A Cochrane Review seeking to determine whether glaucoma surgery combined with cataract surgery via phacoemulsification has any advantages over cataract surgery (via phacoemulsification) alone, found that eyes that underwent combined (glaucoma and phacoemulsification) surgery had a significantly lower intraocular pressure (-1.62 mmHg) compared to eyes that underwent phacoemulsification cataract surgery alone. The authors note that this finding is not conclusive, as the studies examined had many differences and poor reporting outcomes.

A Cochrane Review of 42 trials seeking to compare the effectiveness of laser-assisted cataract surgery with standard ultrasound phacoemulsification found uncertain evidence suggesting benefits of one procedure over the other. A meta-analysis of more than 14500 eyes and 37 studies found no significant differences between the two techniques in terms of visual or refractive outcomes or overall complications.

In a Cochrane Review, clinical trials comparing NSAIDs versus corticosteroids in the treatment of postoperative eye inflammation were uncertain, but there was some evidence suggesting patients treated with NSAIDs were less likely to develop cystoid macular edema.

<text>A customs officer is a law enforcement official who enforces customs laws. 

== Canada ==
Canadian customs officers are members of the Canada Border Services Agency. It was created in 2003 and preceded by the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (1999-2003). Customs officers has existed since 1868 under various departments: Customs Office, Customs and Inland Revenue from 1918 to 1923, Customs and Excise from 1923 to 1927 and Revenue Department from 1927 to 1999. They are most visible at 117 land border crossings and 13 international airports between Canada and US, but are also founded at 3 seaports, 3 mail centres within Canada.

== Hong Kong ==
4,931 posts, of which nine are directorate officers, 3,804 are members of the Customs and Excise Department, 504 are Trade Controls Officers and 614 are staff of the General and Common Grades.

Hong Kong is one of the busiest container ports in the world. It handled 20.4 million TEUs (Twenty-foot Equivalent Units) in 2003. Of these, 12.1 million TEUs were handled at the Kwai Chung Container Terminal. In 2003, 70,910 ocean-going ships and 365,190 coastal vessels entered and left Hong Kong.

Ships and vessels are subject to customs check. Cargoes are either examined on board sea freighters or after off-loading.

In 2004, a total of 8.6 million passengers arrived in Hong Kong from the Mainland and Macau by sea and by helicopters. They were processed at the China Ferry T&quot;erminal in Tsim Sha&quot; Tsui and the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal in Central. In addition, a daily average of 49 helicopter flights between Hong Kong and Macau are operated at the Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal. Four Customs launches conduct maritime patrol in the territorial waters round the clock whereas four high-speed pursuit crafts and two shallow water patrol launches are employed to carry out interception at sea.

The C&amp;ED is an active member of the World Customs Organization (WCO) and Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). It exchanges intelligence and works closely with overseas customs administrations and law enforcement agencies. The department has also entered bilateral Cooperative Arrangements with other customs authorities on administrative assistance. At the working level, the department and the China Customs have each established designated liaison officers to facilitate the exchange of intelligence through direct telephone hotlines.

===Mission===
* To protect the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region against smuggling
* To protect and collect revenue on dutiable goods
* To detect and deter narcotics trafficking and abuse of narcotic drugs
* To protect intellectual property rights
* To protect consumer interests
* To protect and facilitate legitimate trade and industry and to uphold Hong Kong&#x27;s trading integrity
* To fulfill international obligations

===Ancient usage===

In ancient usage a &quot;customer&quot; was a person to whom the right to collect customs in a particular port had been granted by the crown, often for a consideration in the form of a farm (an arrangement whereby one rents the income that derives from a revenue stream).

===Modern usage===
Officers working for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the UK Border Force collect a range of taxes and duties, control imported and exported goods, and prevent banned items from entering or leaving the United Kingdom.

The powers of customs officers (&quot;officers&quot;) derive from the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979.
Officers are appointed by the Commissioners of Revenue and Customs, who are in turn appointed by the King. Failure to return a commission by an officer is an offence, as is imitating or obstructing an officer. Officers at ports are now officially part of the Border Force (Home Office) and as such have their powers conferred by the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

At any time, any officer may board and search:
*ships within the limits of a port,
*aircraft at aerodromes, or
*vehicles that are:
**entering, leaving or about to leave the United Kingdom,
**within the prescribed area,
**within the limits of or entering or leaving a port or any land adjacent to a port and occupied wholly or mainly for the purpose of activities carried on at the port,
**at, entering or leaving an aerodrome,
**at, entering or leaving an approved wharf, transit shed, customs warehouse or free trade zone, or
**at, entering or leaving any such premises as are mentioned in subsection (1) of section 112 of the 1979 Act.

Officers shall have free access to every part of any ship or aircraft at a port or aerodrome and of any vehicle as described above or is brought to a customs and excise station, and may:
*cause any goods to be marked before they are unloaded from that ship, aircraft or vehicle,
*lock up, seal, mark or otherwise secure any goods carried in the ship, aircraft or vehicle or any place or container in which they are so carried,
*break open any place or container which is locked and of which the keys are withheld, and
*seize any goods found concealed on board any such ship, aircraft or vehicle.
Carrying away an officer is an offence.

Officers may inspect aircraft and aerodromes, and prevent the departure of aircraft if they have not given their permission for them to depart. They may stop ships in UK territorial waters for the purposes of checking that they have been cleared to leave the UK.

Officers may examine any goods carried or to be carried in a coasting ships at any time while they are on board the ship, or at any place in the United Kingdom to which the goods have been brought for shipment in, or at which they have been unloaded from, the ship.

Officers may ask questions with respect to the baggage of people entering or leaving the United Kingdom and any thing contained therein or carried with them. They may inspect such baggage. Since the amendments to CEMA 1979 inserted by the Policing and Crime Act 2009 Officers may also require a person entering or leaving the United Kingdom to produce a Passport (or National ID Card when that may be used as an alternative) and answer questions about their journey. Any person entering the UK from outside the EU who fails to declare any thing or to produce any baggage or thing as required (unless it they are entitled to exemption from duty and tax by virtue of any order under section 13 of the Customs and Excise Duties (General Reliefs) Act 1979) commits an offence. Any thing chargeable with any duty or tax which is found concealed, or is not declared, and any thing which is being taken into or out of the UK contrary to any prohibition or restriction can be seized.

Officers on anti-smuggling duties may haul up, leave or moor vessels where they wish. They may also enter any part of the coast (or of the shore or bank of any river or creek), railway or aerodrome (or land adjoining any aerodrome), and over any land in Northern Ireland within the prescribed area. They may not, however, enter any garden or pleasure ground.

An officer may board or enter any ship, aircraft, vehicle, house or place and take such steps as are reasonably necessary to stop or prevent the sending of a signal or message connected with smuggling.

Officers may seize:
*ships or aircraft that have been in the UK or vehicles that have been in a port or aerodrome and are constructed, adapted, altered or fitted for concealing goods,
*ships that have thrown overboard, staved or destroyed any part of the cargo to prevent seizure while the ship is in United Kingdom waters or where the ship, having been properly summoned to bring to by any vessel in the service of Her Majesty, fails so to do and chase is given,
*ships or aircraft that have been within the limits of any port in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or any aircraft has been in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man where the master or commander fails to account for a substantial part of the cargo that has been on board.

Officers may fire upon ships liable to forfeiture or examination where they have failed to bring to after the commander of any vessel in the service of Her Majesty has hoisted the proper ensign and caused a gun to be fired as a signal and chase has been given.

Officers may ask any person entering or leaving a free trade zone (as designated by the Treasury) questions with respect to any goods. That person shall, if required by the officer, produce those goods for examination at such place as the Commissioners may direct. Officers may board a vehicle at any time while it is entering or leaving a free trade zone search any part of it. Officers may, at any time, enter upon and inspect a free trade zone and all buildings and goods within the zone.

Officers may enter any premises, vehicles, vessels, aircraft, hovercraft or structures used in connection with an excise licence, and may inspect the premises and search for, examine and take account of any machinery, vehicles, vessels, utensils, goods or materials belonging to or in any way connected with that trade. Officers must be accompanied by a constable at night.
If the premises are those of a distiller, rectifier, compounder, brewer for sale, producer of wine, producer of made-wine, maker of cider or occupier of an excise warehouse, an officer, after having demanded admission into the premises and declared his name and business at the entrance may break open any door or window of the premises or break through any wall for the purpose of obtaining admission. Officers or people acting in their aid must be accompanied by a constable at night.

If an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that any secret pipe or other means of conveyance, cock, vessel or utensil is kept or used by a distiller, rectifier, compounder, registered brewer, producer of wine, producer of made-wine and maker of cider, that officer may, at any time, break open any part of the premises of that trader and forcibly enter them and so far as is reasonably necessary break up the ground in or adjoining those premises or any wall thereof to search for that pipe or other means of conveyance, cock, vessel or utensil.

If the officer finds any such pipe or other form of conveyance leading to or from the trader&#x27;s premises, he may enter any other premises from or into which it leads, and so far as is reasonably necessary break up any part of those other premises to trace its course, and may cut it away and turn any cock thereon, and examine whether it conveys or conceals any goods chargeable with a duty of excise, or any materials used in the manufacture of such goods, in such manner as to prevent a true account thereof from being taken. Every such pipe or other means of conveyance, cock, vessel or utensil as mentioned, and all goods chargeable with a duty of excise or materials for the manufacture of such goods found therein, may be seized. Officers must be accompanied by a constable at night, and damage caused by unsuccessful searches shall be made good by the Commissioners.

Officers may, at a reasonable time of day, enter any premises used for the conduct of a business. If they have reasonable cause to believe that any premises are used for gaming to which section 10 of the Finance Act 1997 (gaming duty) applies or are used in connection with the supply, importation or exportation of goods of a class or description chargeable with a duty of excise and that any such goods are on those premises, they may inspect those premises and any goods found on them. If they believe serious fraud is occurring in connection with such gaming, they may obtain a court warrant to enter the premises using reasonable force.

Officers may detain any person who has committed, or whom there are reasonable grounds to suspect of having committed, any offence for which he is liable to be detained under the customs and excise Acts at any time within 20 years from the date of the commission of the offence. Officers may seize any ship, aircraft, vehicle, animal, container (including any article of passengers’ baggage) or other thing which has been used for the carriage, handling, deposit or concealment of any thing that has become liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts, or any other thing mixed, packed or found with the thing so liable. They may also seize all the tackle, apparel or furniture in any ship, aircraft, vehicle or animal that has become liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts. Ships (but not their contents) of over 250 tons (but not hovercraft) are exempt unless the voyage itself was the offence that caused the seizure, or the ship was being chased.

Officers may &quot;examine and take account of&quot; any goods:
*which are imported,
*which are in a warehouse or Queen&#x27;s warehouse,
*which are in a free trade zone,
*which have been loaded into any ship or aircraft at any place in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man,
*which are entered for exportation or for use as stores,
*which are brought to any place in the United Kingdom for exportation or for shipment for exportation or as stores, or
*in the case of which any claim for drawback, allowance, rebate, remission or repayment of duty is made.

Officers may take samples of certain goods, enter premises with a writ of assistance or search warrant and stop and search vehicles or vessels where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that they are carrying or may be carrying any goods which are:

*chargeable with any duty which has not been paid or secured,
*in the course of being unlawfully removed from or to any place, or
*otherwise liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts

Officers may detain people to search their possessions for dutiable alcoholic liquor, or tobacco products, which are chargeable with any duty of excise, and liable to forfeiture under the customs and excise Acts.

If an officer has reasonable grounds to suspect that

*any person who is on board or has landed from any ship or aircraft,
*any person entering or about to leave the United Kingdom,
*any person within the dock area of a port,
*any person at a customs and excise airport,
*any person in, entering or leaving any approved wharf or transit shed which is not in a port,
*any person in, entering or leaving a free trade zone, or
*in Northern Ireland, any person travelling from or to any place which is on or beyond the boundary

is carrying any article which is chargeable with any duty which has not been paid or secured or (if being imported or exported) of which any prohibition or restriction is in force, they may detain them and search them. This search may be a rub down, strip or intimate search, and must be approved by a superior officer or justice of the peace.

== Sri Lanka ==
In Sri Lanka, as per the Customs Ordinance, enforcement is carried out by the Sri Lanka Customs headed by the Director General of Customs. They wear an all white (without insignia) or khaki (with insignia) uniform.

== United States ==

In the United States, a customs officer is a federal law enforcement officer working to enforce customs laws as well as over 400 laws for other federal agencies. Customs officers enforce these laws for every person or thing that enters or leaves U.S. Among their many functions are detecting and confiscating contraband, making sure that import duties are paid, and preventing those without legal authorization from entering the United States. In the past, American customs officers were part of the Department of the Treasury, the oldest law enforcement agency in the U.S., dating back to 1789. U.S. Customs (CBP) is the second highest revenue collector in the United States through fines, collection of duties, and illegal money seized; only the IRS collects more money for the federal government. Every day, on average, U.S. Customs arrests 135 suspects of different crimes, seizes 2,313 pounds of narcotics, confiscate 196 firearms, intercept 210 fraudulent documents, prevents 54 criminal aliens from entering the U.S., and detains one suspected terrorist. Customs officers need no probable cause to search, detain, or seize anything or any person. Today customs officers work for the Department of Homeland Security within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Office of Investigations. They are present at every international airport, seaport, and all land border crossings.

<doc id="678792" wikidata="Q3506615" url="?curid=678792" title="Swing bowling">
<text>Swing bowling is a bowling technique in cricket, in which the ball is made to curve through the air. This is in the hope that the change in the ball&#x27;s flight path will deceive the batter and cause them to play the ball incorrectly. A bowler who uses this technique is called a swing bowler. Swing bowling is generally classed as a type of fast bowling.

A swing bowling delivery is either an inswinger, where the ball curves in towards the batter, or an outswinger, where the ball curves away from the batter. A swing bowler often bowls a mixture of inswingers and outswingers (as well as other non-swinging types of delivery), by changing how they hold the ball.

To make the ball swing, a bowling side continually polishes one side of the ball by applying sweat to it, as well as rubbing it against their clothing to shine it, while allowing the opposite side to become gradually more rough through the course of play. Conventional swing, also called orthodox swing, occurs when the ball is relatively new, before the shiny side becomes worn over the course of play. The airflow over the rough and shiny sides cause it to move in flight towards the rough side and away from the shiny side. Swing bowlers often use a subtly altered grip on the ball to accentuate this effect. Reverse swing is when it swings in the opposite direction - towards the shiny side. This occurs as the ball becomes more worn, and is rarer.

As swing bowling is heavily dependent on the condition of the ball, a number of ball tampering controversies have been related to it. This is where teams have allegedly tried to alter the wear of the ball illegally using materials such as sandpaper, to produce additional swing. Examples of such incidents are the 2006 ball-tampering controversy and the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal.

==History==
==Theory==

The purpose of swing bowling is to get the cricket ball to deviate sideways as it moves through the air towards or away from the batter. To do this, the bowler makes use of six factors:

* The raised seam of the cricket ball
* The angle of the seam to the direction of travel
* The wear and tear on the ball
* The polishing liquid used on the ball
* The speed of the delivery
* The bowler&#x27;s action

Asymmetry of the ball is encouraged by the polishing of one side of the ball by members of the fielding team, while allowing the opposite side to deteriorate through wear and tear. With time, this produces a difference in the aerodynamic properties of the two sides.

Both turbulent and laminar airflow contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates from the surface of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the &quot;separation point&quot; moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. On the turbulent flow side it remains attached longer, separating towards the rear and steering the wake to one side, generating a lift force.

==Conventional swing==

Typically, a swing bowler aligns the seam and the sides of the ball to reinforce the swing effect. This can be done in two ways:
*Outswinger: An outswinger to a right-handed batter can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the left towards the slips and placing the roughened side of the ball on the left. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate their wrist toward the slips while keeping their arm straight. To a right-handed batter, this results in the ball moving away to the off side while in flight, usually outwards from their body. James Anderson, Malcolm Marshall, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev, Tim Southee, Mitchell Starc, Dominic Cork, Courtney Walsh and Dale Steyn have been great exponents of the outswingers.
*Inswinger: An inswinger to a right-handed batter can be bowled by aligning the seam slightly to the right and placing the roughened side of the ball on the right. To extract consistent swing, a bowler can also rotate or &quot;open up&quot; their wrist towards leg slip. To a right-handed batter, this results in the ball moving in to the leg side while in flight, usually inwards towards their body.

The curvature of swing deliveries can make them difficult for a batter to hit with their bat. Typically, bowlers more commonly bowl outswingers, as they tend to move away from the batter, meaning they have to &quot;chase&quot; the ball to hit it. Hitting away from the batter&#x27;s body is dangerous, as it leaves a gap between the bat and body through which the ball may travel to hit the wicket. Also, if the batter misjudges the amount of swing, they can hit the ball with an edge of the bat. An inside edge can ricochet on to the wicket, resulting in them being out bowled, while an outside edge can fly to the wicket-keeper or slip fielders for a catch.

There has been a distinct lack of left-arm swing bowlers in the game. Some of the most famous left-arm bowlers were Pakistan&#x27;s Wasim Akram, Mohammad Amir and Shaheen Afridi, India&#x27;s Zaheer Khan and Irfan Pathan, Australia&#x27;s Alan Davidson, Mitchell Johnson and Mitchell Starc, Sri Lanka&#x27;s Chaminda Vaas and New Zealand&#x27;s Trent Boult.

When the ball is new the seam is angled to one side, back-spinning the ball with the fingers for stability in flight. This causes the boundary layer on the side of the seam to become turbulent and separate later than the laminar flow on the other side, making the ball swerve.

==Reverse swing==
Normal swing occurs mostly when the ball is fairly new. As it wears more, the front face is rough enough to make the flow turbulent from the beginning. The forward seam on the shiny side triggers a separation of the flow earlier than on the rough side, so when the ball becomes very old – around 50 or more overs old – it begins to swing towards its shiny side. It is mainly helpful for bowlers in Test matches. This is known as &quot;reverse swing&quot;, meaning that a natural outswinger will become an inswinger and vice versa. However, the new ball may reverse its trajectory if the speed is high (more than 90 mph (around 140 km/h)). This is also called contrast swing or reverse swing. 

Reverse swing tends to be stronger than normal swing, and to occur late in the ball&#x27;s trajectory. This gives it a very different character from normal swing, and because batters experience it less often, they generally find it much more difficult to defend against. It is also possible for a ball to swing normally in its early flight, and then to alter its swing as it approaches the batter. This can be done in two ways one for the ball to reverse its direction of swing, giving it an &#x27;S&#x27; trajectory: the other is for it to adopt a more pronounced swing in the same direction in which the swing is already curving; either alteration can be devastating for the batter. In the first instance, they are already committed to playing the swing one way, which will be the wrong way to address swing which is suddenly coming from the opposite direction: in the second instance, their stance will be one which is appropriate for the degree, or extent, of the expected swing, and which could suddenly leave them vulnerable to LBW, being caught behind, or bowled. Two consecutive deliveries from Wasim Akram, one of each type, were considered to be the turning point of the 1992 World Cup Final.

Pioneers and notable practitioners of reverse swing have mostly been Pakistani fast bowlers. In the early days of reverse swing, Pakistani bowlers were accused of ball tampering to achieve the conditions of the ball that allow reverse swing. According to the ex-chairman of the Pakistan cricket board, Shaharyar Khan, reverse swing was invented by Saleem Mir, who played for the Punjab Cricket Club in Lahore during the late 1960s and taught it to his team-mate Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz Nawaz introduced reverse swing into international cricket during the late 1970s, and passed their knowledge on to their team-mate Imran Khan, who in turn taught the duo of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The English pair of Andrew Flintoff and Simon Jones, having been taught by Troy Cooley and the Indian bowlers like Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, were also well known for the ability to reverse swing, among many others. Bowlers try to disguise the direction of reverse swing by running up starting with the opposite hand before switching hands and covering the ball for as long as possible before release. Neil Wagner utilizes this to show the ball is reversing, but disguises the direction of swing.

==Playing swing bowling==

Firstly, a batter needs good eye reflexes which are considered to be a key skill when facing swing bowling. Secondly, a batter often needs to anticipate &quot;beforehand&quot; what the ball will do and adjust accordingly to play swing bowling. This can be done by observing the bowler&#x27;s grip and action (which may have a marked difference depending on which type of swinger is to be delivered), by observing the field set, which may depend on the types of deliveries expected (as a rule outswingers will have more slips assigned) or by means of prior knowledge of the bowler; many can bowl or are proficient in only one type of swing. Traditional methods include the batsmen playing the ball as late as possible, and not playing away from the body. Other effective measures for combating swing bowling include standing well outside the crease, thus giving the ball less time to swing; and guessing the direction of swing based on the seam position observed in the ball&#x27;s flight.

==Ball tampering controversies==
Controversy regarding reverse swing has never left modern cricket, as the Pakistani team was accused of ball tampering by the Australian umpire Darrell Hair during the fourth test against England in 2006 when the ball began to reverse swing after the 50th over. His co-umpire Billy Doctrove supported him. A hearing subsequently found that there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone of ball tampering.

<text>The Harry Elkins Widener Memorial Library, housing some 3.5million books, is the centerpiece of the Harvard Library system. It honors 1907 Harvard College graduate and book collector Harry Elkins Widener, and was built by his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener soon after his death in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912.

Widener&#x27;s &quot;vast and cavernous&quot; stacks hold works in more than one hundred languages which together comprise &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most comprehensive research collections in the humanities and social sciences.&quot; Its of shelves, along five miles (8km) of aisles on ten levels, comprise a &quot;labyrinth&quot; which one student &quot;could not enter without feeling that she ought to carry a compass, a sandwich, and a whistle.&quot;

At the building&#x27;s heart are the Widener Memorial Rooms, displaying papers and mementos recalling the life and death of Harry Widener, as well as the Harry Elkins Widener Collection,
&quot;the precious group of rare and wonderfully interesting books brought together by Mr. Widener&quot;,
to which was later added one of the few perfect Gutenberg Biblesthe object of a 1969 burglary attempt conjectured by Harvard&#x27;s police chief to have been inspired by the 1964 heist film&quot;Topkapi&quot;.

==Background, conception and gift==

===Predecessor===

By the opening of the twentieth century alarms had been issuing for many years about Harvard&#x27;s &quot;disgracefully inadequate&quot;
library, Gore Hall, completed in 1841 (when Harvard owned some 44,000 books)
and declared full in 1863.
Harvard Librarian Justin Winsor concluded his 1892 Annual Report by pleading, &quot;&quot;;
his successor Archibald Cary Coolidge asserted that the Boston Public Library was a better place to write an thesis.
Despite substantial additions in 1876 and 1907,
in 1910 a committee of architects termed Gore Hall

With university librarian William Coolidge Lane reporting that the building&#x27;s light switches were delivering electric shocks to his staff,
and dormitory basements pressed into service as overflow storage
for Harvard&#x27;s 543,000 books,
the committee drew up a proposal for replacement of Gore in stages. Andrew Carnegie was approached for financing without success.

===Death of Harry Widener===


On April 15, 1912, Harry Elkins Widenerscion of two of the wealthiest families in America, a 1907 graduate of Harvard College, and an accomplished bibliophile despite his youthdied
in the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;.
His father George Dunton Widener also perished, but his mother Eleanor Elkins Widener survived.

Harry Widener&#x27;s will instructed that his mother, when &quot;in her judgment Harvard University shall make arrangements for properly caring for my collection of books... shall give them to said University to be known as the Harry Elkins Widener Collection&quot;,
and he had told a friend, not long before he died, &quot;I want to be remembered in connection with a great library, [but] I do not see how it is going to be brought about.&quot;

To enable the fulfillment of her son&#x27;s wishes Eleanor Widener briefly considered funding an addition to Gore Hall, but soon determined to build instead a completely new and far larger library building&quot;a perpetual memorial&quot;
to Harry Widener, housing not only his personal book collection but Harvard&#x27;s general library as well,
with room for growth.
As Biel has written, &quot;The [Harvard architects] committee&#x27;s Beaux Arts design [for Gore Hall&#x27;s projected replacement], with its massiveness and symmetry, offered monumentality with nothing more particular to monumentalize than the aspirations of the modern university&quot;until the &quot;Titanic&quot; sank and &quot;through delicate negotiation, [Harvard] convinced Eleanor Widener that the most eloquent tribute to Harry would be an entire library rather than a rare book wing.&quot;

===Terms and cost of gift===

To her gift Eleanor Widener attached a number of stipulations,
including that the project&#x27;s architects be the firm of Horace Trumbauer&amp; Associates,
which had built several mansions for both the Elkins and the Widener families.
&quot;Mrs. Widener does not give the University the money to build a new library, but has offered to build a library satisfactory in external appearance to &quot;herself,&quot;&quot; Harvard President Abbott Lawrence Lowell wrote privately.
&quot;The exterior was her own choice, and she has decided architectural opinions.&quot;
Harvard historian William Bentinck-Smith has written that

Though Harvard awarded Trumbauer an honorary degree on the day of the new library&#x27;s dedication,
it was Trumbauer associate Julian F. Abele who had overall responsibility for the building&#x27;s design,
which largely followed the 1910 architects&#x27; committee&#x27;s outline (though with the committee&#x27;s central circulation room shifted from the center to the northeast corner, yielding pride of place to the Memorial Rooms).

After Gore Hall was demolished to make way, ground was broken on February12, 1913, and the cornerstone laid June16.
By later that year some 50,000 bricks were being laid each day.

==Building==

At Harvard&#x27;s &quot;geographical and intellectual heart&quot;
directly across Tercentenary Theatre from Memorial Church,
Widener Library is a hollow rectangle of &quot;Harvard brick with Indiana limestone traceries&quot;,
250 by 200 by 80feet high (76 by 61 by 24m)
and enclosing 320,000 square feet (30,000m),
&quot;colonnaded on its front by immense pillars with elaborate [Corinthian capitals], all of which stand at the head of a flight of stairs that would not disgrace the capitol in Washington.&quot;
Sources describe the building&#x27;s style as (variously)
Beaux-Arts,
Georgian, Hellenistic,
or &quot;the austere, formalistic Imperial [or &#x27;Imperial and Classical&#x27;] style displayed in the Law School&#x27;s Langdell Hall and the Medical School Quadrangle&quot;.

The east, south, and west wings house the stacks, while the north contains administrative offices and various reading rooms, including the Main Reading Room (now the Loker Reading Room)which, spanning the entire front of the building and some 42feet (13m) in both depth and height, was termed by architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting &quot;the most ostentatious interior space at Harvard.&quot;
A topmost floor, supported by the stacks framework itself, contains thirty-two rooms for special collections, studies, offices, and seminars.

The Memorial Rooms (see § Widener Memorial Rooms) are in the building&#x27;s center, between what were originally two light courts (28 by 110ft or 8.5 by 33m) now enclosed as additional reading rooms.

===Dedication===

The building was dedicated immediately after Commencement Day exercises on June24, 1915.
Lowell and Coolidge mounted the steps to the main door, where Eleanor Widener presented them with the building&#x27;s keys.
The first book formally brought into the new library was the 1634 edition of John Downame&#x27;s &quot;The Christian Warfare Against the Devil, World, and Flesh&quot;,
believed (at the time) to be the only volume, of those bequeathed to the school by John Harvard in 1638, to have survived the 1764 burning of Harvard Hall.



In the Memorial Rooms, after a benediction by Bishop William Lawrence, a portrait of Harry Widener
was unveiled, then remarks delivered by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge (speaking on &quot;The Meaning of a Great Library&quot; on behalf of Eleanor Widener) and Lowell (&quot;For years we have longed for a library that would serve our purpose, but we never hoped to see such a library as this&quot;).
Afterward (said the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot;) &quot;the doors were thrown open, and both graduates and undergraduates had an opportunity to see the beauties and utilities of this important university acquisition.&quot;

&quot;I hope it will become the heart of the University,&quot; Eleanor Widener said, &quot;a centre for all the interests that make Harvard a great university.&quot;

===Widener Memorial Rooms===

The central Memorial Roomsan outer rotunda housing memorabilia of the life and death of Harry Widener, and an inner library displaying the 3300 rare books collected by himwere described by the &quot;Boston Sunday Herald&quot; soon after the dedication:

Conversely, &quot;even from the very entrance [of the building] one will catch a glimpse in the distance of the portrait of young Harry Widener on the further wall [of the Memorial Rooms], if the intervening doors happen to be open.&quot;

For many years Eleanor Widener hosted Commencement Day luncheons in the Memorial Rooms.
The family underwrites their upkeep,
including weekly renewal of the flowersoriginally roses but now carnations.

===Amenities and deficiencies===

Touted as &quot;the last word in library construction&quot;,
the new building&#x27;s amenities included telephones, pneumatic tubes, book lifts and conveyors, elevators,
and a dining-room and kitchenette &quot;for the ladies of the staff&quot;.
Advertisements for the manufacturer of the building&#x27;s shelving highlighted its &quot;dark brown enamel finish, harmonizing with oak trim&quot;,
and special interchangeable regular and oversize shelves meant that books on a given subject could be shelved together regardless of size.

&quot;The Library Journal&quot; found &quot;especially interesting not so much the spacious and lofty reading rooms&quot; as the innovation of placing student carrels and private faculty studies directly in the stack, reflecting Lowell&#x27;s desire to put &quot;the massive resources of the stack close to the scholar&#x27;s hand, reuniting books and readers in an intimacy that nineteenth-century [&#x27;closed-stack&#x27; library designs] had long precluded&quot;.
(Competition for the seventy coveted faculty studies has been a longstanding administrative headache.)

Nonetheless, certain deficiencies were soon noted.
A primitive form of air conditioning was abandoned within a few months.
&quot;The need of better toilet facilities [in the stacks] has been pressed upon us during the past year by several rather distressing experiences,&quot; Widener Superintendent Frank Carney wrote discreetly in 1918.
And after a university-wide search for castoff furniture left many of the stacks&#x27; 300 carrels still unequipped, Coolidge wrote to &quot;There is something rather humiliating in having to proclaim to the world that [Widener offers] unequalled opportunity to the scholar and investigator who wishes to come here, but that in order to use these opportunities he must bring his own chair, table and electric lamp.&quot;
(A week later Coolidge wrote again: &quot;Your very generous gift [has helped] pull me out of a most desperate situation.&quot;)

Later-built tunnels, from the stacks level furthest underground, connect to nearby Pusey Library, Lamont Library,
and Houghton Library.
An enclosed bridge connecting to Houghton&#x27;s reading room via a Widener windowbuilt after Eleanor Widener&#x27;s heirs agreed to waive her gift&#x27;s proscription of exterior additions or alterationswas removed in 2004.
Houghton and Lamont were built in the 1940s to relieve Widener,
which had become simultaneously too smallits shelves were fulland too largeits immense size
and complex catalog made books difficult to locate.
But with Harvard&#x27;s collections doubling every 17 years, by 1965 Widener was again close to full,
prompting construction of Pusey, and in the early 1980s library officials &quot;pushed the panic button&quot; again, leading to the construction of the Harvard Depository in 1986.

==Collections and stacks==

The ninety-unit Harvard Library system, of which Widener is the anchor, is the only academic library among the world&#x27;s five &quot;megalibraries&quot;Widener, the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, France&#x27;s Bibliothèque Nationale, and the British Librarymaking it &quot;unambiguously the greatest university library in the world,&quot; in the words of a Harvard official.

According to the Harvard Library&#x27;s own description, Widener&#x27;s humanities and social sciences collections include

The building&#x27;s 3.5 million volumes occupy of shelves along five miles (8km) of aisles on ten levels divided into three wings each.

Alone among the &quot;megalibraries&quot;, only Harvard allows patrons the &quot;long-treasured privilege&quot; of entering the general-collections stacks to browse as they please, instead of requesting books through library staff.
Until a recent renovation the stacks had little signage&quot;There was the expectation that if you were good enough to qualify to get into the stacks you certainly didn&#x27;t need any help&quot; (as one official put it)
so that &quot;learning to [find books in] Widener was like a rite of passage, a test of manhood&quot;,
and a 1979 monograph on library design complained, &quot;After one goes through the main doors of Harvard&#x27;s Widener Library, the only visible sign says merely ENTER.&quot;
At times color-coded lines and shoeprints have been applied to the floors to help patrons keep their bearings.

As of 2015 some 1700 persons enter the building each day, and about 2800 books are checked out.
Another 3million Widener items reside offsite (along with many millions of items from other Harvard libraries) at the Harvard Depository in Southborough, Massachusetts, from which they are retrieved overnight on request. A project to insert barcodes into each book, begun in the late 1970s, had some 1million volumes yet to reach as of 2006.

===Harry Elkins Widener Collection===

The works displayed in the Memorial Rooms comprise Harry Widener&#x27;s collection at the time of his death, &quot;major monuments of English letters, many remarkable for their bindings and illustrations or unusual provenance&quot;:

Shakespeare First Folios;
a copy of &quot;Poems written by Wil.Shake-speare, gent.&quot; (1640) in its original sheepskin binding;
an inscribed copy of Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;; Johnson&#x27;s own Bible (&quot;used so much by its owner that several pages were worn out and Johnson copied them over in his own writing&quot;);
and first editions, presentation copies, and similarly valuable volumes of Robert Louis Stevenson, Thackeray, Charlotte Brontë, Blake, George Cruikshank, Isaac Cruikshank, Robert Cruikshank
and Dickensincluding the petty cash book kept by Dickens while a young law clerk.
Book collector George Sidney Hellman, writing soon after Harry Widener&#x27;s death, observed that he was &quot;not satisfied alone in having a rare book or a rare book inscribed by the author; it was with him a prerequisite that the volume should be in immaculate condition.&quot;

Harry Widener &quot;died suddenly, just as he was beginning to be one of the world&#x27;s great collectors,&quot;
said the Collection&#x27;s first curator.
&quot;They formed a young man&#x27;s library, and are to be preserved as he left it&quot;except
that the Widener family has the exclusive privilege of adding to it.

Harvard&#x27;s &quot;greatest typographical treasure&quot;
is one of the only thirty-eight perfect copies extant of the Gutenberg Bible,
purchased while Harry was abroad by his grandfather Peter A.B. Widener (who had intended to surprise Harry with it once the &quot;Titanic&quot; docked in New York) and added to the Collection by the Widener family in 1944.

Like all Harvard&#x27;s valuable books, works in the Widener Collection may be consulted by researchers demonstrating a genuine research need.

===Parallel classification systems and dual catalogs===

Like many large libraries, Widener originally classified its holdings according to its own idiosyncratic systemthe &quot;Widener&quot; (or &quot;Harvard&quot;) systemwhich (writes Battles) follows &quot;the division of knowledge in its [early twentieth-century] formulation. The &quot;Aus&quot; class contains books on the Austro-Hungarian Empire; the &quot;Ott&quot; class serves the purpose for the Ottoman Empire. Dante, Molière, and Montaigne each gets a class of his own.&quot;

In the 1970s new arrivals began to be classified according to a modified version of the Library of Congress system.
The two systems&#x27; differences reflect &quot;competing theories of knowledge... In a sense, the [old] Widener system was Aristotelian; its divisions were empirical, describing and reflecting the languages and cultural origins of books and highlighting their relations to one another in language, place, and time; [the Library of Congress system], by contrast, was Platonic, looking past the surface of language and nation to reflect the idealized, essential discipline in which each [item] might be said to belong.&quot;

Because of the impracticality of reclassifying millions of books, those received before the changeover remain under their original &quot;Widener&quot; classifications. Thus among works on a given subject, older books will be found at one shelf location (under a &quot;Widener&quot; classification) and newer ones at another (under a related Library of Congress classification).

In addition, an accident of the building&#x27;s layout led to the development of two separate card catalogsthe &quot;Union&quot; catalog and the &quot;Public&quot; cataloghoused on different floors and having a complex interrelationship &quot;which perplexed students and faculty alike.&quot; It was not until the 1990s that the electronic Harvard On-Line Library Information System was able to completely supplant both physical catalogs.

===Departmental and special libraries===
The building also houses a number of special libraries in dedicated spaces outside the stacks, including:

There are also special collections in the history of science, linguistics, Near Eastern languages and civilizations, paleography, and Sanskrit.

The contents of the Treasure Room, holding Harvard&#x27;s most precious rare books and manuscripts (other than the Harry Elkins Widener Collection itself) were transferred to newly built Houghton Library in 1942.

==In literature and legend==

===Swimrequirement, icecream, and other legends===

Legend holds that to spare future Harvard men her son&#x27;s fate, Eleanor Widener insisted, as a condition of her gift, that learning to swim be made a requirement for graduation from Harvard.
(This requirement, the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; once elaborated erroneously, was &quot;dropped in the late 1970s because it was deemed discriminatory against physically disabled students&quot;.)
&quot;Among the many myths relating to Harry Elkins Widener, this is the most prevalent&quot;, says Harvard&#x27;s &quot;Ask a Librarian&quot; service. Though Harvard has had swimming requirements at various times (e.g. for rowers on the Charles River, or as a now-defunct test for entering freshmen)
Bentinck-Smith writes that &quot;There is absolutely no evidence... that [Eleanor Widener] was, as a result of the Titanic disaster, in any way responsible for [any] compulsory swimming test.&quot;

Another story, holding that Eleanor Widener donated a further sum to underwrite perpetual availability of ice cream (purportedly Harry Widener&#x27;s favorite dessert) in Harvard dining halls, is also without foundation.
A Widener curator&#x27;s compilation of &quot;fanciful oral history&quot; recited by student tour guides includes &quot;Flowers mysteriously appear every morning outside the Widener Room&quot; and &quot;Harry used to have carnations dyed crimson to remind him of Harvard, and so his mother kept up the tradition&quot; in the flowers displayed in the Memorial Rooms.

===Literary references===

In H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional universe Cthulhu Mythos, Widener is one of five libraries holding a 17th-century edition of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, hidden somewhere in the stacks.

Thomas Wolfe, who earned a Harvard master&#x27;s degree in 1922, told Max Perkins that he spent most of his Harvard years in Widener&#x27;s reading room. He wrote of through the stacks of that great library like some damned soul, never at restever leaping ahead from the pages I read to thoughts of those I want to read&quot;; his alter ego Eugene Gant read with a watch in his hand, &quot;laying waste of the shelves.&quot;

Historian Barbara Tuchman considered &quot;the single most formative experience&quot; of her career the writing of her undergraduate thesis, for which she was &quot;allowed to have as my own one of those little cubicles with a table under a window&quot; in the Widener stacks, which were &quot;my Archimedes&#x27; bathtub, my burning bush, my dish of mold where I found my personal penicillin.&quot;

==Burglary and other incidents==

Over the years, Widener has been the scene of various criminal exploits &quot;infamous for their and .&quot;

===Joel C. Williams===

In 1931 former graduate student Joel C. Williams was arrested after attempting to sell two Harvard library books to a local book dealer. Charles Apted and other Harvard officials visited Williams&#x27; home
where (posing as &quot;book buyers&quot; to spare the feelings of Williams&#x27; family)
they found thousands of books which Williams had stolen over the years, many badly damaged. The &quot;absolutely crazy&quot; Williams would &quot;go to students studying in Widener and ask them what course they were taking. He would then borrow all the books for that course in the library. Then no one could get any to study&quot;, library official John E. Shea later recalled.

Despite the misleading implication of bookplates placed in the 2504 recovered books, Harvard&#x27;s charges against Williams were dropped after he was indicted on book-theft charges in another jurisdiction, which imposed a sentence of hard labor. After the unrelated arrest of a book-theft ring operating at Harvard, there was a &quot;noticeable increase in the number of missing books secretly returned to the library&quot;, the &quot;Transcript&quot; reported in 1932.

===Gutenberg Bible theft===
On the night of August 19, 1969 an attempt was made to steal the library&#x27;s Gutenberg Bible, valued at $1million (equivalent to $ million in ).
Equipped with a hammer, pry bar, and other burglarious implements,
the 20-year-old would-be thief hid in a lavatory until after closing, then made his way to the roof, from which he descended via a knotted rope to break through a Memorial Room window.
But after smashing the bible&#x27;s display case and placing its two volumes in a knapsack, he found the additional 70 pounds (32kg) made it impossible for him to reclimb the rope.

Eventually he fell some to the pavement of one of the light courts, where he lay semiconscious
until his moans were heard by a janitor;
he was found about 1a.m.
with injuries including a fractured skull.
&quot;It looks like a professional job all right, in the fact that he came down the rope,&quot; commented Harvard Police Chief Robert Tonis. &quot;But it doesn&#x27;t look very professional that he fell off.&quot;
Tonis speculated that the attempt may have been modeled on a similar caper depicted in the 1964 film&quot;Topkapi&quot;,
though a retired Harvard librarian later commented that the thief (who was later judged insane) &quot;evidently knew nothing about booksor, at least, about selling them... There was no explanation of what he expected to do with the Bible.&quot;

Only the books&#x27; bindings (which were &quot;not valuable [and] did just what a good binding is supposed to do: they protected the inside contents&quot;) were damaged.
Since the incident only one or the other Bible volume is on display at any given time
and a replica has been substituted at times of heightened security concern.

=== 1969 Vietnam War protests ===

In the spring of 1969, during Harvard student demonstrations against the war in Vietnam, rumors spread of a possible attack on Widener.
Following the occupation of University Hall by protesters, and their subsequent violent ejection by police, volunteer librarians and faculty stood watch inside Widener for several nights.

===&quot;The Slasher&quot;===

Around 1990, empty bindings stripped of their pages began to appear in the Widener stacks. Eventually some 600 mutilated books were discovered, the vandal particularly targeting works on early Christianity in Greek, Latin, or unusual languages such as Icelandic.
Notes left at Widener, and later at Northeastern University, threatened graphically described mutilations of library workers, cyanide gas attacks,
and bombings of libraries and a local bank.
Other notes instructed that $500,000 be left in a Northeastern library, demanded that Northeastern &quot;terminate all Jew personnel&quot;, and directed that $1million be left in the Widener stacks:

These &quot;ransom drops&quot; were staked out by the FBI,
and surveillance cameras installed in ersatz books, without result.

In 1994 police connected an incident at Northeastern, in which a library worker there (a former Widener employee) was caught stealing chemistry books, with the fact that chemistry texts had been among the works mutilated at Widener.
Officials found &quot;a kind of renegade reference room&quot; in the worker&#x27;s basement,
including library books, piles of ripped-out pages, a microfilm camera, and hundreds of unusable microfilms he had haphazardly made of the books (worth $180,000) he had destroyed.
At trial &quot;The Slasher&quot; said he had acted in revenge for the eighteen months he had been detained in a state psychiatric hospital after expiration of a six-month jail term he had received for a minor offense.

==Artwork==
Two of Gore Hall&#x27;s granite pinnacles were preserved, and flank Widener&#x27;s rear entrance.

In the 1920s the university commissioned John Singer Sargent to paint, within the fourteen-foot-high arched panels flanking the entrance to the Memorial Rooms, two murals giving tribute to Harvard&#x27;s World WarI dead: &quot;Death and Victory&quot; and &quot;Entering the War&quot;.
The accompanying inscription, by Lowell, reads: &quot;Happy those who with a glowing faith/ In one embrace clasped Death and Victory&quot;.
With Memorial Church, which directly faces Widener, these constitute what the Boston Public Library calls &quot;the most elaborate World WarI memorial in the Boston area.&quot;

Above the Memorial Rooms entrance is inscribed:

(Eleanor Elkins Widener became Eleanor Elkins Rice when, in October 1915, she married Harvard professor and surgeon
Alexander Hamilton Rice Jr.,
a noted South American explorer whom she had met at the library&#x27;s dedication four months earlier. She died in 1937.)

On the second floor is a bronze bust by Albin Polasek of sculptor and muralist Frank Millet, who had also died on the &quot;Titanic&quot;.
In the main reading room is a sculpture of George Washington; on the stairs to the third floor a sculpture of John Elbridge Hudson; and on the ground floor a sculpture of Henry Ware Wales,
as well as vaulted hallways&quot;just like the Oyster Bar at Grand Central... astounding&quot;, according to historian Thomas Gickby Rafael Guastavino, who (with his son) also designed and built domes and vaults in buildings such as Carnegie Hall, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and the Boston Public Library.

Three dioramasdepicting the grounds, buildings, and vicinity of Harvard Yard in 1667, 1775 and 1936were installed behind the main stairs in 1947, but removed during renovations in 2004.
A six-foot-square bronze tablet, featuring a bas relief of Gore Hall, is at the exterior northwest corner. Its inscription reads in part:
==Restrictions on women==

The building originally included a separate Radcliffe Reading Room behind the card catalogs&quot;barely large enough for a single table&quot;to which female students were restricted &quot;for fear their presence would distract the studious Harvard men&quot; in the main reading room.

In 1923 a sequence of communications between Librarian William Coolidge Lane and another Harvard official dealt with &quot;the incident of Miss Alexander&#x27;s intrusion into the reading room&quot;,
and Keyes Metcalf, Director of University Libraries from 1937 to 1955, wrote that early in his tenure a Classics professor &quot;rushed into my office, looking as if he were about to have an apoplectic stroke, and gasped, &#x27;I&#x27;ve just been in the reading room, and there is a Radcliffe girl in there! By then female graduate students were permitted to enter the stacks, but only until 5p.m., &quot;after which time it was thought they would not be safe there&quot;.

&quot;Even the ever-present problem of inadequate lavatories worked to deny functional access to women&quot;, wrote Battles. &quot;Patrons requesting directions to a women&#x27;s restroom were routinely misled, denied access, or simply told that such things did not exist at a college for men such as Harvard.&quot;

By World WarII (Elizabeth Colson recalled years later) &quot;we could go into the [Main Reading Room] and use the encyclopedias and things like that there, if we stood up, but we couldn&#x27;t sit down&quot;,
and only by special permission (which even female faculty members had to request in writing) could a woman work in the building in the evening.

==Renovation==
A five-year, $97million renovation completed in 2004
(the first since the building opened) added fire suppression and environmental control systems, upgraded wiring and communications, remodeled various public spaces, and enclosed the light courts to create additional reading rooms
(beneath which several levels of new offices and mechanical equipment were hidden).

&quot;Claustrophobia-inducing&quot; elevators were replaced,
the bottom shelves on the lowest stacks level were removed in recognition of chronic seepage problems,
Widener&#x27;s &quot;olfactory nostalgia... actually the smell of decaying books&quot; was addressed,
and unrestricted light and airseen as desirable when Widener was built but now considered &quot;public enemies one and two for the long-term safety of old books&quot;were brought under control.

Some changes required that the Widener family grant relief
from the terms of Eleanor Widener&#x27;s gift, which forbade that &quot;structures of any kind [be] erected in the courts around which the [Library] is constructed, but that the same shall be kept open for light and air&quot;.

The need to relocate each of the building&#x27;s 3.5million volumes twicefirst to temporary locations, then to new permanent locations, as work proceeded aisle by aislewas turned to advantage, so that by the end of the renovation related materials in the library&#x27;s two classification systems (see § Parallel classification systems) were physically adjacent for the first time;
the chart showing the floor and wing location, within the stacks, of each subject classification was revised sixty-five times during construction.

The project received the 2005 Library Building Award from the American Library Association and the American Institute of Architects.

<doc id="678812" wikidata="Q7208291" url="?curid=678812" title="Point shaving">
<text>In organized sports, point shaving is a type of match fixing where the perpetrators try to change the final score of a game without the intention of changing who wins. This is typically done by players colluding with gamblers to prevent a team from covering a published point spread, where gamblers bet on the margin of victory. The practice of shaving points is illegal in some countries, and stiff penalties are imposed for those caught and convicted, including jail time.

A point-shaving scheme generally involves a sports gambler and one or more players of the team favored to win the game. In exchange for a bribe, the player or players agree to ensure that their team will not &quot;cover the point spread&quot; (the bribed player&#x27;s team may still win but not by as big a margin as that predicted by bookmakers). The gambler then wagers against the bribed team. Alternatively, players on the team picked to lose may be bribed to lose by more points than the indicated point spread, and gamblers will wager on their opponents, the favorites, to cover the spread. Also, an official (referee) of the game may be bribed, or even bet on his own behalf, so that one or more &quot;close calls&quot; will be called in favor of the &quot;underdog&quot; rather than the team favored to win.

== Basketball ==

Basketball is a particularly easy medium for shaving points because of the scoring tempo of the game and the ease by which one player can influence key events. By deliberately missing shots or committing turnovers or fouls, a corrupt player can covertly ensure that their team fails to cover the point spread without an outright loss. This is further complicated due to the similar behavior of an honest player who takes a shot and misses. Although the NCAA has adopted a zero-tolerance policy with respect to gambling activity by its players; some critics believe that it unwittingly encouraged point shaving due to its formerly strict rules regarding amateurism, combined with the large amount of money wagered on its games. The NCAA has produced posters warning players not to engage in point shaving.

Famous examples of point shaving are the CCNY point-shaving scandal in 1951; the Dixie Classic and the greater NCAA University Division scandals of 1961; the Boston College basketball point-shaving scandal of 1978–79, which was perpetrated by gangsters Henry Hill and Jimmy Burke; and the Tulane men&#x27;s basketball point-shaving scandal of 1984–85, which led the university to disband its program for four seasons.

On 15 August 2007, NBA referee Tim Donaghy pleaded guilty to two felonies related to wagering on games that he officiated in a scheme somewhat related to point shaving. The difference in this case was that Donaghy sought to affect the outcome of over-under bets by changing calls so that both teams would score more than predicted, thus seeking to give the impression that at worst that he was merely strictly calling fouls as opposed to being outright biased.

On April 17, 2024, Jontay Porter was banned from the NBA due to a point shaving like scandal. He advised gamblers to bet the under on his stats, then left early for suspicious reasons, and received money from the gamblers.

== In popular culture ==
In the television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, the character Carmine Lupertazzi Sr. was reputed to have invented the concept of point shaving in 1951.

Point shaving is an underlying plot thread in the 1974 film &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; and the 2005 remake. In both films, the character Paul &quot;Wrecking&quot; Crewe, a former professional quarterback, was kicked out of the NFL for point shaving prior to the events of the films.

In &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, Nathan Scott, the star basketball player of Tree Hill High, colludes with a gambler to shave points during the North Carolina high school state semi-finals. This eventually leads to him losing a scholarship to Duke University and temporarily derailing his college prospects. He bounces back from the scandal to play at a junior college, leading to a scholarship to the University of Maryland and a career in the NBA.

<text>Steven John Wilson (born 3 November 1967) is an English musician. He is the founder, guitarist, lead vocalist and songwriter of the rock band Porcupine Tree, as well as being a member of several other bands, including Blackfield, Storm Corrosion and No-Man. He is also a solo artist, having released seven solo albums since his solo debut &quot;Insurgentes&quot; in 2008. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Wilson has made music prolifically and earned critical acclaim. His honours include six nominations for Grammy Awards: twice with Porcupine Tree, once with his collaborative band Storm Corrosion and three times as a solo artist. In 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described him as &quot;a resolutely independent artist&quot; and &quot;probably the most successful British artist you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot;.

Wilson is a self-taught composer, producer, audio engineer, guitar and keyboard player, and plays other instruments as needed, including bass guitar, autoharp, hammered dulcimer and flute. His influences and work have encompassed a diverse range of genres including pop, psychedelia, progressive rock and electronic, among others, shifting his musical direction through his albums. His concerts incorporate quadraphonic sound and elaborate visuals. He has worked with artists such as Elton John, Guns N&#x27; Roses, XTC, Opeth, Pendulum, Yes, King Crimson, Fish, Marillion, Black Sabbath, and Anathema, and has built a reputation for his work remixing classic pop and rock records into new stereo, 5.1 and Dolby Atmos versions.

Wilson’s forthcoming eighth studio album, &quot;The Overview,&quot; is scheduled for release on 14 March 2025.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Kingston upon Thames, London, Wilson was raised from age six in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, where he discovered his interest in music around the age of eight. According to Wilson, his life was changed one Christmas when his parents bought presents for each other in the form of LPs. His father and mother received Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;, respectively. It was Wilson&#x27;s affinity for these albums that helped craft his guitar and songwriting abilities. He said, &quot;In retrospect I can see how they are almost entirely responsible for the direction that my music has taken ever since.&quot; His interest in Pink Floyd led him towards experimental/psychedelic conceptual progressive rock (as exemplified by Porcupine Tree and Blackfield), and Donna Summer&#x27;s trance-inflected grooves inspired the initial musical approach of No-Man (Wilson&#x27;s long-running collaboration with fellow musician and vocalist Tim Bowness).

As a child, Wilson was forced to learn the guitar, but he did not enjoy it; his parents eventually stopped paying for lessons. When he was eleven, he found a nylon string classical guitar from his attic and started to experiment with it; in his own words, &quot;scraping microphones across the strings, feeding the resulting sound into overloaded reel to reel tape recorders and producing a primitive form of multi-track recording by bouncing between two cassette machines&quot;. A year later, his father, who was an electronic engineer, built him his first multi-track tape machine and a vocoder so he could begin experimenting with the possibilities of studio recording.

===Early bands===

Wilson said his taste in music diverged from his peers in the 1980s:I grew up in the 80s, and it was a pretty bad decade for music. There were some interesting things developing, but everyone I knew wanted to be in Level 42, Simple Minds or U2. I wasn&#x27;t interested in any of that, so I found solace in the 60s and 70s music that my parents were listening to. And I began to discover this wonderful era, what you&#x27;d call the great album era, from 1967 to 1977, from &quot;Sgt Pepper&quot; through to punk. 

One of Wilson&#x27;s earliest musical projects was the psychedelic duo Altamont (featuring a 15-year-old Wilson working with synth/electronics player Simon Vockings). Their one and only cassette album, &quot;Prayer for the Soul&quot;, featured lyrics by English psychedelic scenester Alan Duffy, whose work Wilson would later use on the first two Porcupine Tree albums. Around the same time that Wilson was part of Altamont, he was also in a progressive rock band called Karma, which played live around Hertfordshire and recorded two cassette albums, &quot;The Joke&#x27;s on You&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Last Man To Laugh&quot; (1985). These contained early versions of &quot;Small Fish&quot;, &quot;Nine Cats&quot; and &quot;The Joke&#x27;s on You&quot;, which were subsequently resurrected as Porcupine Tree songs.

Wilson went on to join the New Wave/AOR band Pride of Passion as keyboard player, replacing former Marillion keyboard player Brian Jelliman (another former Marillion member, Diz Minnitt, also played in the band). Pride of Passion would later change their name to Blazing Apostles and alter their lineup and approach, finally coming to an end in 1987.

===Breakthrough work===
In 1987, Wilson launched the two projects that would make his name. The first of these was initially called &quot;No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man)&quot;, although it would later be renamed &quot;No-Man.&quot; This began life as a solo Wilson instrumental project blending progressive rock with synth pop, subsequently moving towards art-pop when singer/lyricist Tim Bowness joined the project the following year. The second project was &quot;Porcupine Tree&quot;, which was originally intended to be a full-on pastiche of psychedelic rock (inspired by the similar Dukes of Stratosphear project by XTC) carried out for the mutual entertainment of Wilson and his childhood friend Malcolm Stocks.

Over the next three years, the projects would evolve in parallel. Of his two efforts, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) was the first to release a commercial single (1989&#x27;s &quot;The Girl From Missouri&quot;, on Plastic Head Records), while Porcupine Tree built an increasing underground reputation via the release of a series of cassette-only releases via The Freak Emporium (the mail-order wing of British psychedelic label Delerium Records).

By 1990, No Man Is An Island (Except The Isle of Man) had fully evolved into No-Man and was a voice/violin/multi-instrument trio which had incorporated dance beats into its art-pop sound. The second No-Man single – a crooned cover of the Donovan song &quot;Colours&quot; arranged in a dub-loop style anticipating trip hop - won the Single of the Week award in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and gained the band a recording contract with the high-profile independent label One Little Indian (at the time, famous for the Shamen and Björk). Their debut One Little Indian single, &quot;Days in the Trees&quot;, won the same Single of the Week award the following year. The single also briefly charted and, although sales were not outstanding, Wilson had now gained credibility in the record industry (as well as enough finance to fit out his home studio with the equipment he would need to advance his music).

By this time, Wilson had also released the official Porcupine Tree debut album, &quot;On the Sunday of Life...&quot; (which compiled the best material from the underground tapes). No-Man&#x27;s debut full-length release – a compilation of EP tracks called &quot;Lovesighs – An Entertainment&quot; – followed in 1992, as did Porcupine Tree&#x27;s infamous LSD-themed maxi-single &quot;Voyage 34&quot; which made the &quot;NME&quot; indie chart for six weeks. No-Man also toured England with a six-piece band including three ex-members of the art-pop band Japan – Mick Karn, Steve Jansen and (most significantly) keyboardist Richard Barbieri. 1993 saw Wilson consolidating his initial success with albums from both Porcupine Tree (&quot;Up the Downstair&quot;) and No-Man (&quot;Loveblows And Lovecries – A Confession&quot;).

Porcupine Tree, meanwhile, toured frequently and passed through various overt phases of different musical stylings (including psychedelia, progressive rock, modern guitar rock and heavy metal) while retaining the core of Wilson&#x27;s sonic imagination and songwriting. By the mid-2000s Porcupine Tree had become a well known rock band with albums on major labels such as Atlantic and Roadrunner.

===Diversification and collaborations===

During the late 1990s, Wilson&#x27;s love of experimental, drone and ambient music led to a series of new projects, notably Bass Communion and Incredible Expanding Mindfuck (also known as IEM). He also began to release a series of CD singles under his own name.

Having established himself as a producer, Wilson was invited to produce other artists, notably the Norwegian artist Anja Garbarek and Swedish progressive-metal band Opeth. Though he claims to enjoy production more than anything else, with the demands of his own projects, he has mostly restricted himself to mixing for other artists in the last few years.

Wilson has written reviews for the Mexican edition of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. They are all translated into Spanish. Two reviews have been published so far: one for Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;In Rainbows&quot; and another for Murcof&#x27;s 2007 work, &quot;Cosmos&quot;. He has also contributed to US magazine &quot;Electronic Musician&quot;. Wilson wrote the foreword for 2010 book &quot;Mean Deviation&quot;.

Wilson produced and contributed backing vocals, guitar and keyboards for Opeth on the albums &quot;Blackwater Park&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and &quot;Damnation&quot;, also contributing lyrics for one song (&quot;Death Whispered a Lullaby&quot;) in &quot;Damnation&quot;. In addition to this, he has collaborated on many projects with Belgian experimental musician Dirk Serries of Vidna Obmana and Fear Falls Burning, most notably on their collaboration project Continuum which has so far produced two albums. Wilson is also featured on a Fovea Hex EP &quot;Allure&quot; (Part3 of the &quot;Neither Speak Nor Remain Silent&quot; trilogy of EP&#x27;s) on bass guitar. This EP was released in April 2007 through Die-Stadt Musik.

Wilson has also worked with a range of other artists, including OSI, JBK, Orphaned Land, Paatos, Theo Travis, Yoko Ono, Fish, Cipher and Anja Garbarek, by performing songwriting duties as well as performing musically. Wilson is featured on the Pendulum album &quot;Immersion&quot;, with his vocals featuring on &quot;The Fountain&quot;. He made a guest appearance on Dream Theater&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; on the song &quot;Repentance&quot;, as one of several musical guests recorded apologizing to important people in their lives for wrongdoings in the past.

Wilson did an interview with German musician and composer Klaus Schulze. Schulze was an important figure of the Krautrock movement. This interview is featured as bonus material in Schulze&#x27;s Live DVD, &quot;Rheingold&quot;.

Wilson has become known for his 5.1 surround sound mixes, with the 2007 Porcupine Tree album &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; nominated for a Grammy Award in the &quot;Best Mix For Surround Sound&quot; category. It was also voted #3 album of the year by &quot;Sound And Vision&quot;. Wilson has worked on several other surround sound projects, which have included remixing the Jethro Tull and King Crimson back catalogues, as well as Marillion&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Misplaced Childhood&quot;. The Anathema album &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot; was mixed by Wilson and he is thanked in the album liner notes, and he mixed two songs on their subsequent album &quot;Distant Satellites&quot;. He also did the remix for &quot;In the Land of Grey and Pink&quot; by Canterbury scene band Caravan. The first three new editions were issued in October 2009, with more emerging in batches over the coming years. Wilson is responsible for the 5.1 and new stereo mixes of the 1992 XTC album &quot;Nonsuch&quot; in 2013, as well as the Gentle Giant albums &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; and &quot;Octopus&quot; in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2018, he released &quot;Yes: The Steven Wilson Remixes&quot;, consisting of the albums &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971), &quot;Fragile&quot; (1971), &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; (1972), the double album &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973), and &quot;Relayer&quot; (1974). 

Wilson&#x27;s other remixes include The Who&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;, Tears for Fears&#x27; &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; and &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Moondance&quot;, Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot;, Nile Rodgers &amp; Chic&#x27;s first five studio albums, Ultravox&#x27;s &quot;Vienna&quot;, Suede&#x27;s self-titled debut album, and Roxy Music&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

== Solo career ==

=== 2003–2010: &quot;Cover Version&quot; ===

Between 2003 and 2010, Wilson released a series of six two-track CD singles under his own name. Each single featured a cover version and an original song - or, in one case, a Wilson arrangement of a traditional song. It featured songs by Canadian singer Alanis Morissette, Swedish pop group ABBA, English rock band the Cure, Scottish songwriter Momus, American musician Prince, and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan.

Separate from the &quot;Cover Versions&quot; series, Wilson has also contributed a cover version of the Cardiacs song &quot;Stoneage Dinosaurs&quot;. The song was featured on &quot;Leader of the Starry Skies: A Tribute to Tim Smith, Songbook 1&quot;, which is a fundraising compilation album released in December 2010 to benefit the hospitalised Cardiacs leader Tim Smith, whom Wilson has cited as a major inspiration spiritually, if not necessarily in style.

The complete collection of the cover version songs was released as an album titled &quot;Cover Version&quot; in 2014.

=== 2008–2009: Debut solo album &quot;Insurgentes&quot; ===

In November 2008, Wilson released his first official solo album, &quot;Insurgentes&quot;, recorded between January–August 2008. The album was first released as two limited edition versions, both with hardback book featuring the images of longtime collaborator Danish photographer Lasse Hoile. A standard retail version was released on 9March 2009.

Lasse Hoile&#x27;s full-length feature version of the film based on the recording of the album was premiered at the international film festival in Copenhagen in November 2009. The film was also screened at film festivals in Canada, Germany, Mexico, Sweden and United States. The film is described as part documentary, part surreal road movie. Hoile also directed a video for the song &quot;Harmony Korine&quot; from the album. The video was a homage to European art house films, and has been nominated for &quot;Best Cinematography Award&quot; and &quot;Best Music Video Award&quot; at Camerimage.

A remix mini album was released in June 2009, featuring remixes of material from &quot;Insurgentes&quot; by David A. Sitek, Dälek, Engineers, Pat Mastelotto and Fear Falls Burning.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;Grace for Drowning, Get All You Deserve&quot; live concert film ===

Wilson&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot;, was released in September 2011 in CD, vinyl and Blu-ray formats. It is a double album, with the individual parts named &quot;Deform to Form a Star&quot; and &quot;Like Dust I Have Cleared from My Eye&quot;. Wilson also announced his first solo tour in Europe and North America to promote his solo albums. The tour took place in October and November 2011 and contained songs from both &quot;Insurgentes&quot; and &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot;. A live video performance recorded in Mexico titled &quot;Get All You Deserve&quot; was released on 25 September 2012.

On 16 December 2011, Wilson announced new European tour dates for the second leg of his &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot; tour, running in April and May 2012. South American dates were later added and announced on 21 February 2012. He also won the &quot;Guiding Light&quot; title at the Progressive Music Awards in 2012.

=== 2013–2014: &quot;The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)&quot; ===

Wilson&#x27;s third solo studio album, recorded with most of the members of the touring band for &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot; was released on 25 February 2013. Alan Parsons engineered the sessions in Los Angeles. The album reached the top 30 in the UK, and number3 in the German album charts. In October 2012, Wilson announced the first leg of the supporting tour, consisting of 18 shows across Europe and 17 shows across North America between March–May 2013. For these shows, Chad Wackerman (best known for his work with Frank Zappa) replaced Marco Minnemann on drums due to conflicting schedules. The second leg of the tour from October–November 2013 covered Australia and Europe, and included a sold-out show at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The song &quot;The Raven That Refused to Sing&quot; was featured in the trailer for the 2014 film &quot;Pompeii&quot;. The album finished top of several critics and readers polls, including UK &quot;Prog&quot; magazine and German magazine &quot;Eclipsed&quot;. The album was voted album of the year at the 2013 Progressive Music Awards. On 13 July 2015 &quot;The Prog Report&quot; ranked the album as #2 on their top prog albums of the last 25 years.

=== 2015–2016: &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; ===
Wilson&#x27;s fourth solo album, &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot;, was released on 27 February 2015. It was inspired by a documentary about Joyce Carol Vincent, a young British woman who lay dead in her apartment for nearly three years before being discovered. &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics. &quot;The Guardian&quot; rated the album five stars and called it &quot;a smart, soulful and immersive work of art&quot;. &quot;Eclipsed&quot; magazine described the album as &quot;one more shining jewel in the discography of Steven Wilson&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; awarded &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; 6/7 and described it as &quot;another masterpiece&quot;. US website FDRMX rated the album 4.8/5 and stated &quot;&quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; grabs your full attention from the beginning to the very final note, and that&#x27;s the sign of a great album&quot;. The supporting tour spanned from March to June 2015 and consisted of 31 shows in Europe and a total of 34 shows in North and South America. In September, two special shows took place at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Due to the Aristocrats&#x27; tour, for the American shows Guthrie Govan and Marco Minnemann were replaced by Dave Kilminster and Craig Blundell, respectively.

=== 2017–2018: &quot;To the Bone&quot; ===

On 12 December 2016, Wilson began recording his fifth solo studio album with engineer Paul Stacey in London. With the departure of most of the members of his solo band from the prior two albums, Wilson handled most of the guitar on the album, with Craig Blundell and Jeremy Stacey both contributing drums. Ninet Tayeb was featured on additional vocals and had a bigger role than she did on &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot; Andy Partridge of XTC revealed that he co-wrote two songs for the album. On 5January 2017, Wilson posted a teaser clip of himself and Ninet Tayeb recording a new song titled &quot;Pariah&quot;. In April 2017, Wilson announced that he had switched record labels for the release, with the album to be released on Caroline International. Wilson also mentioned that harmonica player Mark Feltham is going to be playing on the next record and released a clip of him contributing to a song titled &quot;To the Bone&quot;. Slovak musician David Kollar featured on three songs of the new record.

On 9 May 2017, the album was officially unveiled as &quot;To the Bone&quot; and released on 18 August 2017. Wilson embarked on major tours of the UK, Europe and North America in 2018 and 2019 to promote the album. For the tour, Alex Hutchings was introduced to replace Dave Kilminster as the guitarist of the live band, as the latter would go on to work in Roger Waters&#x27; band.

On 12 September 2018, a live album was announced via his official Instagram account under the name &quot;Home Invasion: In Concert at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, and it was released on 2November 2018.

=== 2019–2021: &quot;The Future Bites&quot; ===

On 26 May 2019, Wilson confirmed on his Instagram account that the writing and recording process on his sixth studio album was underway. It was expected to be released in 2020. The album was produced by David Kosten, who is also known as Faultline, making the upcoming album Wilson&#x27;s second to not be produced by him alone. On 21 October 2019, Wilson announced &#x27;The Future Bites Tour&#x27;, his largest and most ambitious show to date. The Future Bites Tour was planned to be performed in large arenas in the UK, France, Germany, The Netherlands and Poland in September 2020. On 24 December 2019, Wilson announced that his as yet untitled sixth studio album was close to completion and promised further news in early 2020.

On 5 March 2020, Wilson began a teaser campaign across his online channels, centering on modern themes of consumerism, product branding and manipulative social media. A few days later, artwork for &quot;Personal Shopper&quot; was unveiled with a release date of 12 March 2020 at 9am GMT. On 12 March 2020, Wilson announced that his sixth solo album &quot;The Future Bites&quot; would be released on 12 June 2020. The first single to be taken from the album, &quot;Personal Shopper&quot; (featuring a spoken word appearance by Elton John), was released the same day.

On 22 April 2020, Wilson announced that the release date of &quot;The Future Bites&quot; would be pushed back to 29 January 2021, due to logistical/creative challenges facing the music industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2020, Wilson launched &quot;The Album Years&quot;, an audio-only podcast with his partner in No-Man, Tim Bowness. It was very successful upon release, charting highly all around the world on Apple Podcasts. Starting in March 2024 new video episodes of the podcast were recorded and released.

On 22 September 2020, Wilson relaunched &quot;The Future Bites&quot; with a revised album tracklist and the release of a new single, &quot;Eminent Sleaze&quot;, along with the release of a video produced by Crystal Spotlight. On 29 October 2020, Wilson released a video for &quot;King Ghost&quot;, the third single to be taken from &quot;The Future Bites&quot;. This was directed by Wilson&#x27;s longtime video collaborator Jess Cope.

On 24 November 2020, Wilson released &quot;12 Things I Forgot&quot;, the fourth single from &quot;The Future Bites&quot;. The release of &quot;12 Things I Forgot&quot; was accompanied with an announcement that a completely unique, one of one limited edition of &quot;The Future Bites&quot; would be sold on 27 November 2020 for £10,000, with all proceeds going to Music Venue Trust to help save UK music venues affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This edition of the album sold immediately after going on sale.

=== 2021–2023: &quot;The Harmony Codex&quot; ===

On 22 March 2021, Wilson announced that due to uncertainty surrounding live performances amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, The Future Bites Tour (scheduled to begin in September 2021) would be cancelled. Wilson stated that he will now concentrate on upcoming music projects, including his seventh studio album, a conceptual work entitled &quot;The Harmony Codex&quot; that is planned for release in mid-2023. Wilson also revealed an autobiography, &quot;Limited Edition of One&quot;, which was published by Little, Brown and Company on 7 April 2022. In his 2023 new year&#x27;s message, Wilson stated that &quot;The Harmony Codex&quot; is to be released on the Virgin Music label and will be 65 minutes long. The album was released on 29 September 2023.

=== 2024–present: &quot;The Overview&quot; ===
Wilson is currently working on his forthcoming eighth studio album called &quot;The Overview&quot;, tentatively scheduled for release in early 2025. When asked when the new album might be released, Wilson stated, Beginning of 2025. I work very quickly and I&#x27;m still excited by making music. This is just two 20-minute long tracks. So it&#x27;s a very conceptual, and I think that&#x27;ll be finished and ready to come out early next year.

On 24 June 2024, Wilson announced The Overview Tour with dates scheduled for May–June 2025 in the UK and Europe. It is his first solo tour since the To the Bone Tour in 2018–2019.

On 20 December 2024, Wilson announced that &quot;The Overview&quot; will be released on 14th March 2025 via Fiction Records.

==Musical projects==
===Porcupine Tree===

Porcupine Tree started out as a duo of Wilson and his school friend Malcolm Stocks (with Wilson providing the majority of the instrumentation and Stocks contributing mostly ideas, additional vocals and experimental guitar sounds). Wilson began experimenting by recording music in his home until he had the hunch it could become someway marketable. The material was subsequently compiled into three demo tapes (&quot;Tarquin&#x27;s Seaweed Farm&quot;, &quot;Love, Death &amp; Mussolini&quot; and &quot;The Nostalgia Factory&quot;). For the first tape, he even wrote an inlay introduction to an obscure (imaginary) band called &quot;The Porcupine Tree&quot;, suggesting the band met in the early &#x27;70s at a rock festival, and they had been in and out of prison many times. The booklet also contained information about band&#x27;s obscure members like Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones, and crew members like Linton Samuel Dawson (if put into initials forming LSD). Wilson: &quot;It was a bit of fun. But of course like anything that starts as a joke, people started to take it all seriously!&quot;. When Wilson signed to Delerium label, he selected what he considered the best tracks from these early tapes. All those songs were mastered and made up Porcupine Tree&#x27;s first official studio album, &quot;On the Sunday of Life...&quot;.

Quickly after, Wilson would release the single &quot;Voyage 34&quot;, a thirty-minute long piece that could be described as a mixture of ambient, trance and psychedelia. This was done partly as an attempt to produce the longest single yet released, which it was until it was later exceeded by The Orb&#x27;s &quot;Blue Room.&quot; With non-existent radio play &quot;Voyage 34&quot; still managed to enter the &quot;NME&quot; indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic.

The second full-length album, &quot;Up the Downstair&quot; (though Wilson considers it the first &#x27;proper&#x27; PT album since it was made as such and not simply compiled), was released in 1993 and had a very good reception, praised by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year&quot;. This was the first album to include ex-Japan member, keyboardist Richard Barbieri and Australian-born bassist Colin Edwin. About the end of the year, Porcupine Tree became a full band for the first time with the inclusion of Chris Maitland on drums.

Wilson continued exploring the ambient and trance grounds and issued &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;. It also entered the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, and &quot;Music Week&quot; charts and many fans started hailing them as the Pink Floyd of the nineties, something Wilson would reject: &quot;I can&#x27;t help that. It&#x27;s true that during the period of &quot;The Sky Moves Sideways&quot;, I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn&#x27;t make albums anymore. Moreover, I regret it.&quot;

The band&#x27;s fourth work, &quot;Signify&quot;, included the first full-band compositions and performance, which resulted in less use of drum machines and a more full-band sound. It can be considered a departure from its predecessors for a more song-oriented style. After the release of the live album &quot;Coma Divine&quot; concluded their deal with Delerium in 1997, the band moved to Snapper and issued two poppier albums, &quot;Stupid Dream&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; in 2000.

Two years would pass until their seventh studio album, and in the meantime the band switched labels again, this time signing to the major label Lava. Drummer Chris Maitland was also replaced by Gavin Harrison. &quot;In Absentia&quot; was released in 2002, featuring a heavier sound than all the group&#x27;s previous works. It charted in many European countries and remains one of the top-selling Porcupine Tree albums to date. The 2004 special edition was also their first record to be released in 5.1 Surround Sound, winning the &quot;Best Made-For-Surround Title&quot; award from the Surround Music Awards 2004 shortly afterwards.

In 2005, Porcupine Tree released &quot;Deadwing&quot;, a record inspired by a film script written by Steven Wilson and his friend Mike Bennion. This became the first Porcupine Tree album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, entering at #132. The album won &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;album of the year&quot; award and its surround version received the &quot;Best Made-For-Surround Title&quot; once again.
Wilson started writing Porcupine Tree&#x27;s next album in early 2006 in Tel Aviv, Israel, alongside work on the second album for his side-project Blackfield. Writing sessions finished in London, UK, in June 2006. In August of the same year the band released their first live DVD, titled &quot;Arriving Somewhere...&quot;, and started a tour between September and November to promote it; the first half of each show was made up of all-new material. When the tour concluded the band went into the studio and finished recording and mastering the album. In early January 2007, the band revealed the album title was going to be &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; (a deliberate reference to Public Enemy&#x27;s &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot;) and the concept was influenced by the Bret Easton Ellis novel Lunar Park. The album hit the shops on 16 April 2007 in Europe and 24 April in USA. The lyrics revolve around common 21st Century issues such as technology alienation, teen violence, prescription drugs, attention deficit disorder and bipolar disorder.

&quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; resulted in the most successful album to date in terms of market and sales, and also received the most favourable reviews of the band&#x27;s whole career. It entered the Billboard 200 at #59, and charted in almost all European countries, peaking at #31 in the UK. It was nominated for a US Grammy, and won several polls as the best album of the year (e.g. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Aardshock, The Netherlands). In July 2007, the &quot;Nil Recurring&quot; EP was released, containing material that had been left off the album.

At a European show in August 2008, Wilson said Porcupine Tree was beginning work on material for their next album with an eye toward a release in 2009. This album was later revealed to be titled &quot;The Incident&quot;. &quot;The Incident&quot; is a double CD set containing &quot;The Incident&quot;, a 55-minute &quot;song cycle&quot;, on the first disc and four shorter songs on the second. It has received significant attention and media coverage and the band achieved their highest chart positions to date, reaching 5in The Netherlands, 9in Germany, 23 in the UK and 25 on the Billboard 200 in the USA. The subsequent tour of the US and Europe highlighted a large increase in the band&#x27;s following, with many shows sold out. The single from &quot;The Incident&quot;, &quot;Time Flies&quot; was available as a free download from iTunes for one week in October 2009.
In 2010 after this tour, the band became inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects.

The band reformed in 2021 after a 12 year hiatus. The band is now made up of a trio line-up of Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison. The band&#x27;s former bassist, Colin Edwin, did not return. The reformation was formally revealed on 1 November 2021, with the simultaneous release of the &quot;Harridan&quot; single and the announcement of a new studio album, &quot;Closure/Continuation&quot;, released on 24 June 2022.

===No-Man===

No-Man is Wilson&#x27;s long-term collaboration with singer and songwriter Tim Bowness. Influenced by styles from ambient music to hip-hop, their early singles and albums were a mixture of dance beats and lush orchestrations. After a few years the duo started to create more textural and experimental music. Beginning with &quot;Flowermouth&quot; in 1994, they have worked with a very wide palette of sounds, and many guest musicians, blending balladry with both acoustic and electronic sounds. No-Man was the first Wilson project to achieve any degree of success, signing with UK independent label One Little Indian (the label of Björk, the Shamen and Skunk Anansie among others).

On 22 November 2019, the band released their seventh album, &quot;Love You to Bits&quot;, their first original recording in 11 years.

===I.E.M.===

In 1996, the first in a series of albums by I.E.M. (The Incredible Expanding Mindfuck, a name which had also been considered for Porcupine Tree in its infancy) was released, dedicated to exploring Wilson&#x27;s love of krautrock and experimental rock music. Initially, Wilson had planned for the project to be anonymous, but then label Delerium Records published a song on their Pick N Mix compilation with the composition credited to &quot;Steven Wilson&quot; and so attempts to pass off the project in this way were abandoned. The project released two more albums &quot;Arcadia Son&quot;, and &quot;IEM Have Come For Your Children&quot;, in 2001. A box set of four CDs, consisting of everything Wilson recorded under the name - billed as &quot;an homage and a final farewell to I.E.M.&quot; - was released in June 2010.

===Bass Communion===

In 1998, Wilson launched Bass Communion, a project dedicated to recordings in an industrial, ambient, drone, and/or electronic vein. So far there have been several full length Bass Communion CDs, vinyl LPs, and singles, many of them issued in handmade or limited editions. 
===Blackfield===

In 2001, Wilson met and began to collaborate with Israeli rock musician Aviv Geffen, with whom he created the band Blackfield. Since then the duo have released three acclaimed albums of what they refer to as &quot;melodic and melancholic rock.&quot; The albums spawned several singles, notably &quot;Blackfield,&quot; &quot;Pain&quot; and &quot;Once.&quot; A live DVD from a show in New York was released in 2007. A third album, &quot;Welcome to My DNA&quot;, came in March 2011. Later that year Wilson decided to take a secondary role in the band, feeling that with so much of his time and attention devoted to his solo career, there was not enough left for him to properly fill the role of co-leader of Blackfield as well. He still contributed to the band&#x27;s fourth album in 2013 as singer and producer. Wilson left the band after a short European tour in February 2014 and a final date in New York City on 1May 2014, due to his increasingly tight schedule with his solo career and upcoming projects. In June 2015 and June 2016, Wilson was seen in recording sessions with Geffen and Alan Parsons. In August 2016, Blackfield announced that their new album, &quot;Blackfield V&quot;, would mark the return of Wilson to the band in &quot;full partnership&quot;.
On 13 May 2019, Geffen uploaded a picture to his official Instagram account, revealing that both musicians are currently working on their sixth record.

===Storm Corrosion===

In March 2010, Wilson and Mikael Åkerfeldt, the front man of Opeth, decided to work on a new project as a collaboration under the name of &quot;Storm Corrosion&quot;. The self-titled album was released in May 2012 on &quot;Roadrunner Records&quot;. It has been described as being &quot;the final part in the odd trilogy of records completed by (Opeth&#x27;s) &quot;Heritage&quot; and Steven Wilson&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Grace for Drowning&quot;.&quot; They did not tour or play any live shows in support of the album, and while the two have expressed interest in working together again, nothing definite has emerged from this.

==Performance style==
For live shows, Wilson plays barefoot, a habit that goes back to his early childhood. He said, &quot;I always had a problem wearing shoes and I&#x27;ve always gone around with bare feet.&quot; He said that another factor in performing barefoot is the advantage it gives in operating his diverse guitar pedals. He has injured his feet as a result: in one of his early shows, he ended up with a syringe inserted in his foot and had to get a tetanus vaccine. He said, &quot;I&#x27;ve stepped on nails, screws, drawing pins, stubbed my toe, I&#x27;ve come off stage with blood just coming out... I mean, I&#x27;ve had it all mate, but to be honest, nothing&#x27;s going to stop me.&quot; He later started using a carpet, which reduced the frequency of such incidents.

==Recognition and influence==
In addition to his legacy with Porcupine Tree, some artists have cited Wilson directly as an influence, including Steffen Kummerer of Obscura, Caligula&#x27;s Horse, Tor Oddmund Suhrke of Leprous, Jonathan Carpenter of the Contortionist, Bilocate, and Alex Vynogradoff of Kauan.

Other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for his solo work, including Elton John, Alex Lifeson, Steve Howe, Robert Trujillo, Adrian Belew, Jordan Rudess, Mike Portnoy, Rob Swire, Seven Lions, Demians (Nicolas Chapel), Jem Godfrey, Jim Matheos, Dan Briggs, Eraldo Bernocchi, and Chantel McGregor.

==Personal life==
Wilson prefers to keep a low profile, following the example of musicians like Radiohead, Pink Floyd and Tool, but he shares snapshots of his life on Instagram. He shared the news that he married his girlfriend Rotem in September 2019, subsequently sharing the news and a wedding picture on his Instagram page. His wife has two girls from her previous marriage. His family has also set up an Instagram account for their dog Bowie Wilson, named after David Bowie.

Wilson is a vegan and an atheist, and although fascinated by the subject of religion, he is a strong critic of organised religion. He believes in not imposing his views, but to express them through stories and characters, saying, &quot;I think that is all you can do as an artist. Not preach to your audience but just reflect the world with all its flaws and joys.&quot; He does not smoke and does not use recreational drugs, except for an occasional drink. In a 2016 article he expressed his admiration for Israel and was critical of musicians such as Roger Waters who have boycotted Israel.

In a June 2022 interview with Qobuz alongside Richard Barbieri, he mentioned that &quot;Zeit&quot; by the German electronic music pioneers Tangerine Dream was his favorite album of all time; he called the band the &quot;birth of ambient music.&quot;

<text>Okotoks ( , originally ) is a town in the Calgary Region of Alberta, Canada. It is on the Sheep River, approximately south of Downtown Calgary. Okotoks has emerged as a bedroom community of Calgary. According to the 2021 Federal Census, the town has a population of 30,214, making it the largest town in Alberta.

== History ==

The town&#x27;s name is derived from &quot;ohkotok&quot;, the Blackfoot language word for &quot;rock&quot;. The name may refer to Big Rock, the largest glacial erratic in the Foothills Erratics Train, situated about west of the town.

Before European settlement, journeying First Nations, members of the Blackfoot Confederacy, used the rock as a marker to find the river crossing situated at Okotoks. The tribes were nomadic and often followed large buffalo herds for their sustenance. David Thompson explored the area as early as 1800. 
In the late 1870s and early 1880s, the site of the future town was a river crossing location on the freight wagon route from Fort Macleod to Fort Calgary. Stagecoaches also used the trail. Known as the Macleod Trail or the Macleod-Calgary Trail, the route was an extension of the Fort Benton-Fort Macleod Trail, which led from Fort Benton, Montana to Fort Macleod. There were two fords on the Sheep River, and two stopping houses were established on the north side of the river for rest and shelter for the travellers. Because of these stopping houses, the area attracted settlement. Once the railway was built through the town in 1892, the old trail fell out of use.

In 1879, the area saw the killing of the last buffalo. Government leasing of land for or began in 1880. This created a major change in the region. The first settlers arrived in 1882.

A community grew around a sawmill that was established in 1891, and it would grow in size. The last stagecoach stopped in Okotoks in 1891 when rail service between Calgary and Fort Macleod replaced horse-drawn travel. 

By 1897, the community name had changed three times, first from Sheep Creek, to Dewdney after Edgar Dewdney the Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories, and later being informed by post office authorities in Ottawa of an older settlement named Dewdney in Lower Mainland, British Columbia, the name Okotoks was chosen by local businessman John Lineham. The rail line is still a main line south to the United States border, but the last of the passenger service (Dayliner unit) ended in 1971.

In 2007, the energy efficient Drake Landing Solar Community was established in Okotoks.

=== Flooding ===
Okotoks has experienced three major flooding events, in 1995, 2005 and 2013. The 2005 event, which affected much of southern Alberta, flooded virtually all lands adjacent to the Sheep River, including the central business district, were at least briefly flooded, with the most serious damage being inflicted to riverside pathways, parks and campgrounds. Okotoks was also affected by the 2013 Alberta floods.

=== Heritage conservation ===
Numerous old buildings have been restored, and one house was even resited blocks away to avoid destruction by the widening of the highway through the townsite.

== Geography ==

=== Land annexation ===
Effective 1 July 2017, the Government of Alberta approved the annexation of approximately of land. Okotoks and the Municipal District of Foothills reached an agreement more than three years after the town first issued its notice of intent to seek more land to accommodate its long-term growth plans. Okotoks will gain a 60-year land supply that will enable the Town to develop housing and other services over the next several decades.

=== Water conservation ===
Although the Sheep River runs through Okotoks year round, artesian wells near the river supply the town with its water. In September 1998, Okotoks became one of the first communities in Canada to recognize its environmental limits to growth were restricted by the carrying capacity of the local watershed. In concern for the supply of water, the town announced a unique and controversial suggestion of capping its population at 25,000 residents. In an interview on &quot;The Current&quot;, Mayor Bill McAlpine stated that this objective may be politically difficult due to the surrounding region.

=== Climate ===

Okotoks experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with generally warm summers and long, cold winters. Rainfall is usually limited to the summer, with most of it falling between the months of May and September.

== Economy ==

The sawmill that was established by John Lineham along the Sheep River in 1891 operated for 25 years and was a major part of the local economy. At one time it employed 135 people, producing an average of of lumber per day. The growth of the Canadian Pacific Railway created a demand for railway ties and the mill helped meet that demand. Logs were brought down from the west via the Sheep River. The mill has long since disappeared but one building (one of the oldest remaining in the township) still stands. It housed an award-winning (butter) dairy from the 1920s to the 1940s. It currently houses a law office and restaurant. In May 2015, the Old Creamery was severely damaged following a suspected arson attack. On 15 June 2015, the Town Council voted to demolish the building.

In 1900, just west of Okotoks, four brick-making plants were opened. Many of the first brick buildings in Okotoks (of which a number still exist) were constructed using locally-made brick. The industry reached its peak in 1912, when twelve million bricks were manufactured. The outbreak of World War I caused the shutdown of “Sandstone” as it was known.

By 1906, the population had hit 1900, a figure that would not be reached again until 1977.

Oil was discovered west of Okotoks on 7 October 1913. Okotoks became the supply centre. In its heyday, from 1913 to the 1960s, Okotoks was busy with horses, wagons, and transports hauling all types of equipment to the oil fields, and crude oil back through town to refineries in Calgary.

The Texas Gulf sulphur plant (known as CanOxy) opened in 1959, employing 45 people. It was not unusual to see the bright yellow, three-story high, block-long, block-wide pile of sulphur waiting to be melted or ground up and poured into railway cars.

Since 1974, Okotoks has been hosting a collector car auction in late May. It is the longest running collector car auction in Canada.

Okotoks was one of the few communities its size with its own airport. A number of small air shows were held there over the years. It was the home of an aircraft charter company, flight school, and a helicopter flying school. The site has now evolved into an airpark community called the Calgary/Okotoks Air Park, where the property owners, if they wish, can build homes with attached hangars for their private planes. There is also a small private aerodrome, Calgary/Okotoks (Rowland Field) Aerodrome. Otherwise, like other communities in the vicinity of Calgary, it is served by Calgary International Airport.

==Transit==

Okotoks Transit operates an on-demand bus service within the town boundaries. The system began in 2019 with accessible vans instead of traditional buses.

<doc id="678893" wikidata="Q259884" url="?curid=678893" title="Origa">
<text>Olga Vitalevna Yakovleva (, October 12, 1970 – January 17, 2015), better known as Origa, was a Russian singer who rose to prominence for her musical collaborations in Japan, especially her work for the Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. franchise.

==History==
Origa was born in the small urban village of Kochenyovo, 50 kilometres west of Novosibirsk.
After graduating from music school in 1990, she took an opportunity to visit Japan in 1991 and finally contracted with the ROAD&amp;SKY Organization in 1993. She later participated in several projects with various artists in addition to the Radio Japan Series and being part of the chorus for the Kobe earthquake disaster charity single. She released eight solo albums, three mini-albums, two compilation albums and 3 singles. She gained popularity outside Japan with the release of &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; and the subsequent original soundtracks, &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T.&quot; and &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex O.S.T. 2&quot;. 

These were written by long-time friend and composer Yoko Kanno, and both the first season&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Inner Universe&quot; (featuring boy soprano Ben Del Maestro) and the second season&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Rise&quot;, used Origa&#x27;s vocals. Origa first performed with Kanno for &quot;∀ Gundam&quot;, singing &quot;Moon&quot; in concerts (on the CD &quot;Moon&quot; is performed by Kanno under the pseudonym of Gabriela Robin; Kanno did not perform this song live until a surprise performance in 2009). In 2005, Origa performed songs for the anime series &quot;Fantastic Children&quot;, most notably the ending theme &quot;Mizu no Madoromi&quot;. 

In 2006, Origa was involved in the lyrics and vocal performance for the opening song &quot;Player&quot; and the ending theme &quot;date of rebirth&quot; from the movie &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society&quot;. In 2007, Origa performed with Yoko Kanno for the Ragnarok 2 Concert. There, she performed all three &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; opening themes; &quot;Player&quot; from &quot;Solid State Society&quot;, &quot;Inner Universe&quot; from the first season, and &quot;Rise&quot; from &quot;2nd GIG&quot;, and substituted for Ilaria Graziano on &quot;Yoru_Vo&quot;, Pierre Bensusan on &quot;ELM&quot;, and Gabriela Robin on &quot;Torukia&quot;. She also performed alongside fellow vocalists Maaya Sakamoto and Mai Yamane and joined in singing selected songs originally performed only by Maaya. 

On December 19, 2008, she performed at Sugizo&#x27;s &quot;Rise to Cosmic Dance&quot; concert held at Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya-AX hall. She later appeared on his 2011 single &quot;The Edge&quot;.

She lent her voice to the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;. The game was released in Japan on December 15, 2011. The soundtrack was composed by Masashi Hamauzu, Naoshi Mizuta and Mitsuto Suzuki.

Beginning in 2013, she worked alongside musician Seiya and the duo have performed together worldwide. In 2014, Origa attended Anirevo (Anime Revolution) where she performed in concert. She performed songs from the &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; series and a medley of many other theme songs, including the debut of what would later become her last song, &quot;Bells&quot;. She also participated in a panel with Production I.G CEO Mitsuhisa Ishikawa.

==Death==
Origa died of heart failure Saturday January 17, 2015 at 8:20 AM following 8 days of hospitalization in the Kanagawa Prefecture. 

Although the announcement on her official website says she died of heart failure, a tweet by anime voice actress Jenya says she died of lung cancer, while another source adds she had fought with lung cancer for 2 years already.

<text>Isaac Campbell Kidd (March 26, 1884 – December 7, 1941) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. He was the father of Admiral Isaac C. Kidd Jr. Kidd Sr. was killed on the bridge of during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The highest-ranking casualty at Pearl Harbor, he became the first U.S. Navy flag officer killed in action in World War II as well as the first killed in action against any foreign enemy.

He was a posthumous recipient of his nation&#x27;s highest military honor—the Medal of Honor. A , , was commissioned in his honor on April 23, 1943. The second ship named after him, , lead ship of four s, was commissioned on March 27, 1981. An guided missile destroyer, , was the third ship named after him and was commissioned on June 9, 2007.

==Early years and military service==
Kidd was born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1884. He entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1902, graduating with the Class of 1906 in February of that year. He was commissioned an ensign in 1908. Kidd participated in the 1907–1909 Great White Fleet cruise around the world while serving on the battleship . Following service on the battleship and armored cruiser , Kidd became the Aide and Flag Secretary to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, the first of his many flagstaff assignments. He was an instructor at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1916–1917.

During and after World War I, Kidd was stationed on , and then he had further staff and Naval Academy service. He was the executive officer of the battleship in 1925–1926, then commanded the Navy transport until becoming the captain of the port at Cristóbal, Panama Canal Zone from 1927 to 1930. Promoted to the rank of captain, he was the chief of staff to the commander, Base Force, United States Fleet in 1930–1932. After three years at the Bureau of Navigation in Washington, D.C., he was the commander of Destroyer Squadron One, Scouting Force, in 1935–1936, stationed in Long Beach, California. The Kidd family resided in a downtown Long Beach apartment building.

During the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Rear Admiral Kidd was the commander of Battleship Division One and the chief of staff and aide to the commander, Battleship Battle Force. At his first knowledge of the attack, he rushed to the bridge of , his flagship, and &quot;courageously discharged his duties as Senior Officer Present Afloat until &quot;Arizona&quot; blew up from a magazine explosion and a direct bomb hit on the bridge which resulted in the loss of his life.&quot;

Further research into the attack on Pearl Harbor indicates RADM Kidd was not the SOPA (Senior Officer Present Afloat) when the attack began. RADM William R. Furlong, commander Battle Forces Pacific was on board his flagship, the minelayer USS Oglala. RADM Furlong was senior by two years promoted on 23 Jun 1938. RADM Kidd was promoted in 1940.

Kidd&#x27;s body was never recovered and to this day he is considered missing in action. U.S. Navy salvage divers located his Naval Academy ring fused to a bulkhead on &quot;Arizona&quot;″s bridge. A trunk containing his personal memorabilia was found in the wreck and sent to his widow. Rediscovered in the attic by his children, both the trunk and its contents are now displayed in the museum at the USS &quot;Arizona&quot; Memorial.

==Awards and decorations==
Admiral Kidd posthumously received the Medal of Honor and the Purple Heart. His other awards include the Army of Cuban Pacification Medal, Mexican Service Medal, World War I Victory Medal with Atlantic Fleet Clasp, American Defense Service Medal with Fleet Clasp, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one bronze battle star for Pearl Harbor (posthumous), and the World War II Victory Medal (posthumous).

Darley was born in Aldby Park, Yorkshire, England. His father was Richard Darley, and his mother Dorothea was a daughter of the regicide Thomas Waite (Wayte).

In 1702, Darley, while in Syria, bought an Arabian colt from Sheikh Mirza for his father, Richard Darley. There are conflicting stories about how much Darley exchanged or paid for the colt; one proposed history is that a price of 300 gold sovereigns was set but after the sheikh withdrew from the deal, Darley arranged for British sailors to steal and smuggle the horse via Smyrna. Nevertheless, he had made arrangements to send him back to Yorkshire. The colt was foaled in Syria, late March or early April in the year 1700. The horse, a bay, was tall for an Arabian horse of the time was 15 hands when described by Darley in a letter to his brother dated 21 December 1703. The horse whose original name was &quot;Ras el Fedowi,&quot; translated as &quot;The Headstrong One&quot;, became immortalised as the &quot;Darley Arabian&quot;.

In Thomas Darley&#x27;s own words, &quot;he was immediately striking owing to his handsome appearance and exceedingly elegant carriage&quot;. Although he never raced, he covered mares at Aldby Park from 1705 until 1719 and lived until the advanced age of 30. His genes added speed to those of stronger English horses of the time. Through his offspring, including his great-grandson, the famous and never beaten Eclipse, he has had the greater influence of the three foundation stallions of the thoroughbred breed. His bloodline is said to be present in about 95% of today&#x27;s thoroughbred racehorses.

<text>A millwright is a craftsman or skilled tradesman who installs, dismantles, maintains, repairs, reassembles, and moves machinery in factories, power plants, and construction sites.

The term &quot;millwright&quot; (also known as &quot;industrial mechanic&quot;) is mainly used in the United States, Canada and South Africa to describe members belonging to a particular trade. Other countries use different terms to describe tradesmen engaging in similar activities. Related but distinct crafts include machinists, mechanics and mechanical fitters.

As the name suggests, the original function of a millwright was the construction of flour mills, sawmills, paper mills and fulling mills powered by water or wind, made mostly of wood with a limited number of metal parts. Since the use of these structures originates in antiquity, millwrighting could arguably be considered one of the oldest engineering trades and the forerunner of modern mechanical engineering.

In modern usage, a millwright is engaged with the erection of machinery. This includes such tasks as leveling, aligning, and installing machinery on foundations or base plates, or setting, leveling, and aligning electric motors or other power sources such as turbines with the equipment, which millwrights typically connect with some type of coupling.

==History==

===Before the modern era===
Originally, millwrights were specialized carpenters who completely designed and constructed mills. Having a working knowledge of drive shafts, bearings, gearing and mechanical belts, they executed every type of engineering operation in the construction of these mills. They designed the patterns of the water wheel systems, carved their gear mechanisms, and finally erected the mill machines.

In the Hellenistic period, Greek millwrights invented the two main components of watermills, the waterwheel and toothed gearing. Greeks, along with the Romans, were the first to operate undershot, overshot and breastshot waterwheel mills.

Muslim millwrights adopted the Greek watermill technology from the Byzantine Empire, where it had been applied for centuries in those provinces conquered by the Muslims. They used several solutions to achieve the maximum output from watermills, by either mounting them to piers of bridges to take advantage of the increased flow or by using a shipmill, a type of watermill powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of ships moored in midstream.
In medieval Europe, millwrights built the first industrial mills which introduced new innovative uses of waterpower. A survey of the types introduced in Western Europe was conducted by Adam Robert Lucas.

In China, in the late 14th century, the millwrights were known as &quot;jiang&quot; and &quot;kong&quot; (a special term for artisan-engineers) and existed at an early age. They learned their craft on the shop floor, in a kind of apprenticeship scheme.

Sir William Fairbairn, a millwright of the late 19th century, wrote in his &quot;Treatise on Mills and Millwork&quot;, &quot;...the millwright of the late centuries was an itinerant engineer and mechanic of high reputation. He could handle the axe, the hammer, and the plane with equal skill and precision...he could set out and cut in the furrows of a millstone with an accuracy equal or superior to that of the miller himself.&quot;

===Modern era===
The introduction of the steam engine and the increasing importance of iron and steel changed the global industrial landscape.
It created specialisation and the birth of new trades (turners, fitters, machine makers, and mechanical engineers). It also changed the traditional job of the millwright.

As James F. Hobart wrote in his book &quot;Millwrighting&quot;, &quot;The ancient type of millwright has passed away. He has gone with the old time carpenter and obsolete shoemaker - the former with 500 pounds of molding planes and woodworking tools, the latter with nothing but pegging and sewing awls, hammer, and knife...&quot;

Through the 20th century, the trade adapted to the change. Modern millwrights work with steel and other materials and must often combine the skills of other mechanical trades in order to successfully install industrial machinery or to assemble machines from pre-fabricated parts. Modern millwrights must also be able to read blueprints and other schematics to aid them in the construction of complex systems. Millwrights are frequently unionized, with estimated numbers of around 45% in the US.

==Modern millwrights==

===General characteristics===
Millwrights install, maintain, repair and troubleshoot stationary industrial machinery and mechanical equipment in sites such as factories, production plants and recreational facilities. However, the exact duties of a millwright vary depending on whether they are unionized or not, with union rules typically being more restrictive than non-union situations, which may have their own job description.

On a typical job millwrights:
* read diagrams and schematic drawings and service manuals to determine work procedures
* operate rigging equipment and dollies to place heavy machinery and parts
* fit bearings, align gears and shafts, attach motors, and connect couplings and belts to precise tolerances
* align and test equipment, and make any necessary adjustments
* perform predictive and operational procedures
* repair or replace defective parts
* service and repair hydraulic and pneumatic systems
* may do some welding (when not structural) and tack welding (a weld that is adequate in size to temporarily hold components in place until it can be completely welded by a registered apprentice welder or a journeyman welder when it is structural) and fabrication as well as maintain an inventory of replacement parts.
*may install concrete for supports or flooring as needed.

Modern standards of practice for millwrights also require working:
* within precise limits or standards of accuracy 
* at heights without fear
* using of logical step-by-step procedures in work
* planning, solving problems and decision-making based on quantifiable information.

===Areas of specialty===
Millwrights by nature of their profession have to be extremely well versed in many aspects of construction/demobilization. They may install a conveyor system at an airport one week and the following week work at an industrial wastewater treatment plant.

====Power industry====
Millwrights in the power generation industry can assemble, set, align and balance turbines or rotors, as well as install pumps, valves, cranes, fans, and travelling screens. Millwrights also perform critical lifts involving major components to be flown level at up to and within .005 inch (5 thousandths of an inch). Because of their training and expertise, Millwrights are generally chosen to work on tasks associated with flying and setting heavy machinery.

====Training and education====
Millwrights are also in demand as teachers for vocational programs, both at the high school level and in post-secondary institutions. Many high schools feature fabrication courses that include metal work, where the experience of a qualified millwright is valuable. Often, these millwrights are paid a premium based on their years of field experience.

===Training===
Millwrights must have a good understanding of fluid mechanics (hydraulics and pneumatics), and all of the components involved in these processes, such as valves, cylinders, pumps and compressors.

They are also trained to work with a wide array of precision tools, such as calipers, micrometers, dial indicators, levels, gauge blocks, and optical and laser alignment tooling.

Most millwrights are educated through apprenticeship programs where they receive a combination of classroom education along with a good deal of on-the-job training. For example, in Alberta, the term of apprenticeship for a millwright is four years (four 12-month periods) including a minimum of 1560 hours of on-the-job training and eight weeks of technical training each year.

Within the Steelworkers Union, known as the United Steelworkers or USW, the largest Industrial Union in North America, there is also a mix of both classroom and on-the-job training. Upon successful completion of required testing in blueprints, hydraulics, pneumatics, rigging, pipefitting, welding, burning, gears, couplings, and other various types of mechanical fasteners and machinery, as well as mobile equipment and other heavy machinery. A typical millwright serves a 4- year apprenticeship before becoming a journeyman.

Apprentices are usually paid a percentage of the average millwright&#x27;s wage, and this percentage increases with experience.

A typical training course, to qualify as a millwright, may include, among others, the following: 
* Shaft alignment 
* Rigging
* Welding
* Machining
* Electrical wiring
* Steel fabrication
* Conveyor systems
* Steam turbine installation
* Gas turbine installation
* Blueprint basic, intermediate and advanced
* Safety basic, intermediate and advanced
* Labor history
* Associate degree classes

==South Africa==
In South Africa, the millwright trade (especially focused on the mining sector) enjoys a far more versatile description than in most other countries. Fields wherein South African millwrights may operate include:
* Low-, medium- and high-voltage electrical fault finding, installation, and maintenance. 
* PLC maintenance, installations, operations and fault finding. 
* Fitting; installation and maintenance of most mechanical equipment, as well as hydraulic and pneumatic systems.
* Steelworks, rigging,
* and various other miscellaneous fields all depending on the site, company, Mine Health and Safety Act, personal interest and specialization.

At most trades training centers, prospective millwright artisans are required to have a certain level of theoretical certification (e.g. N3-Nated- certificate) and psychometric characteristics, judged by thorough testing, in order to qualify for the foundation practical and theoretical technical training.

After being trained in a multitude of different fields, novice, unqualified Millwrights enter in an apprenticeship for &quot;on-the-job&quot; training. There they work alongside all available artisans regardless of trade, depending on the institution. Once they meet a structured quota of experience and pass the necessary modules, apprentices have two months to prepare for their practical Trade Test. After they passed, they receive the certification and status of a qualified Millwright Tradesman. 
Once millwrights qualify, they have the opportunity to qualify as technicians, engineers, planners, foremen and many other routes requiring mainly electrical and mechanical expertise.

Many millwrights choose to enter the private sector to work on a contractual basis.

<doc id="678924" wikidata="Q747376" url="?curid=678924" title="Match fixing">
<text>In organized sports, match fixing (also known as game fixing, race fixing, throwing, rigging or more generally sports fixing) is the act of playing or officiating a contest with the intention of achieving a predetermined result, violating the rules of the game and often the law. There are many reasons why match fixing might take place, including receiving bribes from bookmakers or sports bettors, and blackmail. Competitors may also intentionally perform poorly to gain a future advantage, such as a better draft pick or to face an easier opponent in a later round of competition. A player might also play poorly to rig a handicap system.

Match fixing, when motivated by gambling, requires contacts (and normally money transfers) between gamblers, players, team officials, and/or referees. These contacts and transfers can sometimes be discovered, and lead to prosecution by the law or the sports league(s). In contrast, losing for future advantage is internal to the team and very difficult to prove. Often, substitutions are made by a coach, designed to deliberately increase the team&#x27;s chances of losing (such as having key players sit out, often using minimal or phantom injuries as an excuse), rather than ordering the players who are actually on the field to intentionally underperform, are cited as the main factor in cases where this has been alleged.

Match fixing includes point shaving and spot-fixing, which center on smaller events within a match that can be wagered upon but are unlikely to prove decisive in determining the game&#x27;s final result. According to Sportradar, a company that monitors the integrity of sports events on behalf of sports federations, as many as one percent of the matches they monitor show suspicious betting patterns that may be indicative of match fixing.

Games that are deliberately lost are sometimes called &quot;thrown games&quot;, especially when a team has nothing to play for (either having already qualified for the next stage of competition or is arithmetically unable to qualify for the next stage of the competition, or is in the process of being eliminated.) In contrast, when a team intentionally loses a game or does not score as high as it can, to obtain a perceived future competitive advantage, the team is often said to have &quot;tanked&quot; the game instead of having thrown it. In sports where a handicap or ranking system exists and is capable of being abused (including sports such as racing, grappling and golf), tanking is known as &quot;sandbagging&quot;. Hustling, where a player disguises his abilities until he can play for large amounts of money, is a common practice in many cue sports, such as nine-ball pool.

==Motivations and causes==
Some major motivations behind match fixing are gambling and future team advantage. According to investigative journalist Declan Hill it has also been linked to corruption, violence and tax avoidance. In Eastern Europe, organized crime is linked to illegal gambling and score fixing. In Russia, people have disappeared or been murdered after acting against bribery in sports.

===Agreements with gamblers===

There may be financial gain through agreements with gamblers. The Black Sox Scandal of 1919, in which several members of the MLB&#x27;s Chicago White Sox conspired with gamblers to fix that year&#x27;s World Series for monetary gain.

One of the best-known examples of gambling-related race fixing (in motorsports) is the 1933 Tripoli Grand Prix, in which the winning number of the lottery was determined by the number of the race-winning car. One ticket holder held the number belonging to Achille Varzi, contacted him and agreed to share the winning should he win. Varzi contacted other drivers who agreed to share the money if they deliberately lost. Despite a poor start, Varzi won the race after his opponents deliberately underperformed throughout the race.

A large match-fixing ring in the lower levels of professional tennis, centered around gambling, was broken up in 2023. At least 181 players were involved.

===Better playoff chances===
Many sports have tournaments where the result of one round determines their opponent in the next round. As a result, by losing a match, a team can face an easier opponent in the next round, making them more likely to win.

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the only one of the four major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada in which home advantage in the playoffs is based strictly on regular-season records without regard to seeding. The top six teams earn an automatic playoff berth, while the seventh through tenth teams compete for the last two seeds in a &quot;play-in tournament&quot;.

In the Canadian Football League, since the introduction of the &quot;cross-over rule&quot;, Western teams have been occasionally accused of tanking near the end of the season in situations where a loss would cause them to finish fourth place in their division and where such a finish was still good enough to secure a berth in the league&#x27;s East Division playoffs. In recent years, the East has often been viewed to be a weaker division than the West; however, if any Western team has attempted such a strategy, it has not paid significant dividends for them since teams who qualify for the playoffs via crossover have gone a combined 5-7 in the East Division Semi-Finals, and 0-5 in the East Division Finals. As of the 2022 season, no Western team has advanced to the Grey Cup championship game from the Eastern bracket.

A more recent example of possible tanking occurred in the ice hockey competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics. In Pool B, Sweden was to face Slovakia in the last pool match for both teams. Sweden coach Bengt-Åke Gustafsson publicly contemplated tanking against Slovakia, knowing that if his team won, their quarterfinal opponent would either be Canada, the 2002 gold medalists, or the Czech Republic, 1998 gold medalists. Gustafsson would tell Swedish television &quot;One is cholera, the other the plague.&quot; Sweden lost the match 3–0; the most obvious sign of tanking was when Sweden had a five-on-three powerplay with five NHL stars – Peter Forsberg, Mats Sundin, Daniel Alfredsson, Nicklas Lidström, and Fredrik Modin – on the ice, and failed to put a shot on goal. (&quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Michael Farber would say about this particular powerplay, &quot;If the Swedes had passed the puck anymore, their next opponent would have been the Washington Generals.&quot;) If he was seeking to tank, Gustafsson got his wish; Sweden would face a much less formidable quarterfinal opponent in Switzerland. Canada would lose to Russia in a quarterfinal in the opposite bracket, while Sweden went on to win the gold medal, defeating the Czechs in the semifinals.

The 1998 Tiger Cup – an international football tournament contested by countries in Southeast Asia – saw an example of two teams trying to lose a match. The tournament was hosted by Vietnam, with the eight countries competing split into two groups of four. The top two in each group advanced to the semi-finals with the winners playing the runners-up of the other group. In the first group, Singapore finished on top with Vietnam finishing second; this meant that the winners of the second group would have to travel to Hanoi to play the host nation in the national stadium on their national day, while the runners-up would face Singapore in Ho Chi Minh City where the final group match was taking place. As the two teams involved – Thailand and Indonesia – had both already qualified for the semi-finals, it was in both teams&#x27; interest to lose the match and finish in second place. As the game progressed, neither side seemed particularly concerned with scoring, while the defending was lackadaisical. As the match entered stoppage time, Indonesian defender Mursyid Effendi scored an own goal, overcoming the efforts of several Thai players and the goalkeeper to stop him. Both teams were fined $40,000, and Effendi was banned from international football for life.

In the final month of the 2010 Major League Baseball season, the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays were in a tight race for the American League East division title and by the final week, both teams had already clinched at least the wild card. The Yankees went 3–7 over the final 10 games, losing their regular-season finale, while the Rays went 5–5 and won theirs, giving the Rays the AL East title by one game and the Yankees the AL wild-card berth. Winning the division would have given New York an ALDS matchup against the Texas Rangers, who at the time had star pitcher Cliff Lee; the Yankees instead defeated the Minnesota Twins, a team they historically have had more postseason success against. Allegations of the Yankees purposefully settling for the wild card, presumably to avoid facing Texas in the ALDS, began to surface after the Yankees defeated the Twins. Additional allegations came up in 2012 when Yankees general manager Brian Cashman commented in response to a possible playoff expansion that his team had &quot;conceded the division&quot; and that winning it meant &quot;nothing more than a T-shirt and a hat&quot;. However, Cashman insisted that the Yankees were not motivated by any desire to lose games, but were merely ensuring their best players were well-rested for the postseason, which he contended was perfectly ethical behavior. In 2012, Major League Baseball added a second wild card in each league, with the two wild cards playing a single-elimination game in order to give more importance to winning the division. In 2022, the postseason was further expanded, adding a third wild card and making the round a best-of-three series.

The 2012 Summer Olympics saw two examples of tanking of this type:
* Members of four badminton teams from China, Indonesia and South Korea were ejected from the women&#x27;s doubles tournament for intentionally losing matches to allow better pairings in the knockout stages of the competition. In what the BBC called a &quot;night of shame&quot;, players made simple errors throughout the match, despite booing and jeering from the crowd, and warnings from the match umpire and tournament referee to cease and desist. The Badminton World Federation found the four pairs guilty of &quot;not using one&#x27;s best efforts to win a match&quot; and &quot;conducting oneself in a manner that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the sport.&quot;
* In the women&#x27;s football tournament, Japan intentionally played a draw with South Africa in Cardiff, allowing it to finish second in its group so it would not have to travel to Glasgow, more than 300 miles away, for the first round of the knockout stage. Instead, Japan remained in Cardiff and defeated Brazil in their quarterfinal en route to the gold medal match.

Tanking can also happen in high-school level sports. For example, In February 2015, two girls&#x27; basketball teams representing Nashville-area Riverdale and Smyrna High Schools were found to be tanking during a consolation match of their district tournament. The winner of the game would enter the same side of the regional tournament bracket as defending state champion Blackman High School (ranked as one of the country&#x27;s top 10 teams by some national publications), setting up a potential match in the regional semifinals. The loser would thus avoid Blackman until the regional final, a game whose participants would both advance to the sectional tournament (one step short of the state tournament). During the game both teams pulled their starters early, missed shots on purpose, intentionally turned over the ball and deliberately committed fouls. The Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association, which governs high school sports in the state, ejected both teams from the postseason, fined the two schools (Riverdale $1,000 and Smyrna $500), and placed both teams on probation through the 2015–16 school year.

As previously mentioned, the practice of coaches on a playoff-bound team deliberately benching a team&#x27;s best players for some or all of the final match(es) of the regular season (or alternatively, giving them less playing time than would normally be warranted) is often defended as a common sense measure to avoid unnecessarily risking injuries and fatigue to the team&#x27;s star players. 
Some argue that a coach should not only have the right to select a starting lineup for a match that gives the team the best chances of winning titles in the long should this be a different lineup than the one that gives the team the best chances of winning the game at but that doing so is the smartest course of action.

For example, during Euro 2004 the Czech Republic rested nearly all of its starters from the first two group matches for the final group match against Germany. Since the Czechs had already clinched first place in the group, this move was seen to have the potential to allow Germany a better chance to get the win they needed to advance at the expense of the winner of the Netherlands–Latvia game. As it happened, the Czechs&#x27; decision to field a &quot;weaker&quot; side did not matter since the Czechs won the match anyway to eliminate the Germans.

===Better draft position===
Most top-level sports leagues in North America and Australia hold drafts to allocate young players to the league&#x27;s teams. The order in which teams select players is often the inverse of their standings in the previous season. As a result, a team may have a significant incentive to tank games to secure a higher pick in the league&#x27;s next draft, and a number of leagues have changed their draft rules to remove (or at least limit) potential incentives to tank.

From 1966 to 1984, the NBA used a coin flip between the teams with the worst records in each of the league&#x27;s two conferences to determine the recipient of the top pick. In the , several teams were accused of deliberately losing games in an attempt to gain a top position in the 1984 draft, which would eventually produce four Hall of Fame players. As a result of this, the NBA established a draft lottery in advance of the 1985 draft, involving all teams that did not make the playoffs in the previous season. This lottery system prevented teams from receiving fixed draft positions based on record place, which the league hoped would discourage them from deliberately losing.

Even though the lottery in place through the 2018 draft gave the team with the worst record only the same chance at the top pick as the 2nd and 3rd worst teams (with that team guaranteed no worse than the fourth pick), there was still perceived incentive for a team to tank. Responding to these perceived incentives, the NBA further tweaked its lottery rules shortly before the start of the 2017–18 season. Effective with the 2019 draft, the teams with the three worst records have equal odds of landing the #1 pick (barring one of these teams also owning another lottery team&#x27;s pick), and the top four picks are allocated in the lottery instead of the top three. This limits but does not eliminate the incentive to tank, particularly when there is at least one exceptional prospect.

The Australian Football League, the main competition of Australian rules football, has used a system of priority draft picks since 1993, with poorly performing teams receiving extra selections at or near the start of the draft. Prior to 2012, a team automatically received a priority pick if its win–loss record met pre-defined eligibility criteria. However, that system led to accusations of tanking by several clubs—most notably by Melbourne in 2009 (the club was found not guilty, but the head coach and general manager were found guilty on related charges). Since 2012, priority picks are awarded at the discretion of the AFL Commission, the governing body of both the AFL and the overall sport.

Until the 2014–15 NHL season, the National Hockey League assured the last place team of at least the second position in its entry draft, with the first overall pick being subject to a draft lottery among the five worst teams. As NHL drafts typically include only one NHL-ready prospect, if any at all, in any given year (most others must continue developing in junior ice hockey or the minor leagues for several years before reaching the NHL), this rudimentary lottery has historically been enough of a deterrent to avoid deliberate tanking. However, in 2014–15, two elite prospects widely considered to be &quot;generational talents&quot;, Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, were projected to enter the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, thus ensuring the last place team at least one of the two prospects. This was most prominent with the Buffalo Sabres, whose fans openly rooted against their team in the hopes they would clinch last place in the league for much of the season (the Sabres themselves denied they were tanking and openly criticized their fans for suggesting the notion). Beginning in 2015–16, the top three picks in the draft are subject to lottery, with all fourteen teams that did not qualify for the playoffs eligible to win the picks. However, as the worst team is guaranteed one of the first three picks, tanking is still contemplated when the draft field is deep.

===More favorable schedule next year===
NFL teams have been accused of tanking games to obtain a more favorable schedule the following season; this was especially true between 1977 and 1993, when a team finishing last in a five-team division would get to play four of its eight non-division matches the next season against other last-place teams.

In the current scheduling formula which has been in place since 2002 and slightly amended in 2021, only three games in a team&#x27;s schedule are dependent on a team&#x27;s placement the previous season. The remaining eight non-division games are the same for all teams in a division.

===Match fixing by referees===
In addition to the match fixing that is committed by players, coaches and/or team officials, it is not unheard of to have results manipulated by corrupt referees. Since 2004, separate scandals have erupted in prominent sports leagues in Portugal, Germany (Bundesliga scandal), Brazil (Brazilian football match-fixing scandal) and the United States (see Tim Donaghy scandal), all of which concerned referees who fixed matches for gamblers. Many sports writers have speculated that in leagues with high player salaries, it is far more likely for a referee to become corrupt since their pay in such competitions is usually much less than that of the players.

On December 2, 1896, former Old West lawman Wyatt Earp refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match, promoted as the Heavyweight Championship of the World. Earp was chosen as referee by the National Athletic Association the afternoon of the match after both managers refused to agree on a choice. In the eighth round of a fight dominated by Fitzsimmons, Sharkey suddenly went down, clutching his groin, yelling foul. Referee Earp conferred with both corners for a few seconds before he disqualified Fitzsimmons for a foul that virtually no one saw. Fitzsimmons went to court to attempt to stop Sharkey from taking the purse, but failed when the court ruled that the match was illegal and it had no jurisdiction.

Eight years later, B. Brookes Lee was arrested in Portland, Oregon. He had been accused of treating Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee said, &quot;I fixed Sharkey up to look as if he had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair.&quot;

===Match fixing to a draw or a fixed score===
Match fixing does not necessarily involve deliberately losing a match. Occasionally, teams have been accused of deliberately playing to a draw or a fixed score where this ensures some mutual benefit (e.g. both teams advancing to the next stage of a competition.) One of the earliest examples of this sort of match fixing in the modern era occurred in 1898 when Stoke City and Burnley intentionally drew in that year&#x27;s final &quot;test match&quot; so as to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season. In response, the Football League expanded the divisions to 18 teams that year, thus permitting the intended victims of the fix (Newcastle United and Blackburn Rovers) to remain in the First Division. The &quot;test match&quot; system was abandoned and replaced with automatic relegation.

A more recent example occurred in the 1982 FIFA World Cup, West Germany played Austria in the last match of group B. A West German victory by 1 or 2 goals would result in both teams advancing; any less and Germany was out; any more and Austria was out (and replaced by Algeria, who had just beaten Chile). West Germany attacked hard and scored after 10 minutes. Afterwards, the players then proceeded to just kick the ball around aimlessly for the remainder of the match. Algerian supporters were so angered that they waved banknotes at the players, while a German fan burned his German flag in disgust. By the second half, the ARD commentator Eberhard Stanjek refused any further comment on the game, while the Austrian television commentator Robert Seeger advised viewers to switch off their sets. As a result, FIFA changed its tournament scheduling for subsequent World Cups so that the final pair of matches in each group are played simultaneously.

Another example took place on the next-to-last weekend of the 1992–93 Serie A season. Milan entered their match needing only a point to secure the title ahead of crosstown rivals Inter, while Brescia believed a point would be enough for them to avoid relegation. In a 2004 retrospective on the &quot;dodgiest games&quot; in football history, two British journalists said about the match, &quot;For over 80 minutes, the two teams engaged in a shameful game of cat-and-mouse, in which the cat appeared to have fallen asleep and the mouse was on tranquilisers.&quot; Milan scored in the 82nd minute, but Brescia &quot;mysteriously found themselves with a huge overlap&quot; and equalised two minutes later. The 1–1 draw gave Milan their title, but in the end did not help Brescia; other results went against them and they suffered the drop.

In knockout competitions where the rules require drawn matches to be replayed, teams have sometimes been accused of intentionally playing one or more draws so as to ensure replays. In this case, the motive is usually financial since the ensuing replay(s) would typically be expected to generate additional revenue for the participating teams. One notorious example of this particular type of alleged fix was the 1909 Scottish Cup Final, which sparked a riot after being played twice to a draw.

===Intentional loss to prejudice third-party rival===
A team may deliberately lose a match, giving a victory to the opposing team that damages a third-party rival. An example of this occurred in Sevilla, Spain, during the 1999–2000 La Liga. Sevilla FC were in last place and were already officially relegated. In their thirty-fifth match of the season (out of 38), Sevilla faced Real Oviedo of Asturias, which was itself fighting to avoid relegation. An Oviedo victory would put Sevilla&#x27;s fierce cross-town rival, Real Betis, in the relegation zone. Sevilla performed poorly, while their fans showed support for Oviedo and expressed concern for missed scoring chances by the Asturian side. Oviedo defeated Sevilla 3–2, contributing to the eventual relegation of Betis. Twelve years later, former Sevilla goalkeeper Frode Olsen admitted the team had lost intentionally in order to relegate Betis.

Similarly, a National Football League (NFL) team has also been accused of throwing its final regular-season game in an attempt to keep a rival out of the playoffs. An alleged example of this was when the San Francisco 49ers, who had clinched a playoff berth, lost their regular-season finale in 1988 to the Los Angeles Rams, thereby knocking the New York Giants (who had defeated the 49ers in the playoffs in both 1985 and 1986, moreover injuring 49ers quarterback Joe Montana in the latter) out of the postseason on the intra-conference record tiebreaker; after the game, Giants quarterback Phil Simms angrily accused the 49ers of &quot;laying down like dogs.&quot;

===Increased gate receipts===
In addition to the aforementioned incidents of alleged fixing of drawn matches to ensure replays, mutual fixes have sometimes been alleged in &quot;best of X&quot; knockout series where draws are either not possible or very uncommon. Early versions of baseball&#x27;s World Series were a common target of such allegations. Because the players received a percentage of the gate receipts for postseason games (a privilege they did not enjoy in the regular season), there was a perception that the players had an incentive to fix an equal number of early games in favor of each team so as to ensure the series would run the maximum number of games (or very close thereto).

Partly as an effort to avoid this sort of controversy, early World Series sometimes saw all scheduled games played even if the Series winner was already determined. That did not prove satisfactory since few fans were willing to pay to watch contests. Eventually, following the controversy at the 
conclusion of the 1904 season in which the New York Giants boycotted the World Series in part because of dissatisfaction with the financial arrangements surrounding the Series, Major League Baseball agreed to a number of reforms proposed by Giants owner John T. Brush. Among other things, the so-called &quot;Brush Rules&quot; stipulated that the players would only receive a share of ticket revenue from the first four games, thus eliminating any financial incentive for the players to deliberately prolong the World Series.

===Abuse of tie-breaking rules===
On several occasions, creative use of tie-breaking rules have allegedly led teams to play less than their best.

An example occurred in the 2004 European Football Championship. Unlike FIFA, UEFA takes the result of the game between the two tied teams (or in a three-way tie, the overall records of the games played with the teams in question only) into consideration before overall goal difference when ranking teams level on points. A situation arose in Group C where Sweden and Denmark played to a 2–2 draw, which was a sufficiently high scoreline to eliminate Italy (which had lower-scoring draws with the Swedes and Danes) regardless of Italy&#x27;s result with already-eliminated Bulgaria. Although Italy beat Bulgaria by only one goal to finish level with Sweden and Denmark on five points and would hypothetically have been eliminated using the FIFA tie-breaker too, some Italian fans bitterly contended that the FIFA tie-breaker would have motivated their team to play harder and deterred their Scandinavian rivals from, in their view, at the very least half-heartedly playing out the match after the score became 2–2. The same situation happened to Italy in 2012, leading to many pre-game complaints from Italy, who many commentators suggested were right to be concerned because of their own extensive experience in this area. However, Spain-Croatia ended in a 1–0 win for Spain, and the Italians went through.

The FIFA tie-breaker, or any goal-differential scheme, can cause problems, too. There have been incidents (especially in basketball) where players on a favored team have won the game but deliberately ensured the quoted point spread was not covered (see point shaving). Conversely, there are cases where a team not only lost (which might be honest) but lost by some large amount, perhaps to ensure a point spread was covered, or to grant some non-gambling related favor to the victor. Perhaps the most famous alleged example was the match between Argentina and Peru in the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Argentina needed a four-goal victory over Peru in order to advance over Brazil, a large margin at this level of competition, yet Argentina won 6–0. Much was made over possible political collusion, that the Peruvian goalkeeper was born in Argentina, and that Peru was dependent on Argentinian grain shipments, but nothing was ever proven.

Although the Denmark–Sweden game above led to calls for UEFA to adopt FIFA&#x27;s tiebreaking formula for future tournaments, it is not clear if this solves the problem; the Argentina-Peru game shows a possible abuse of the FIFA tie-breaker. Proponents of the UEFA tie-breaker argue that it reduces the value of &quot;blow-outs&quot;, whether these be the result of a much stronger team &quot;running up the score&quot; or an already-eliminated side allowing an unusually large number of goals. Perhaps the most infamous incident occurred in December 1983 when Spain, needing to win by eleven goals to qualify for the Euro 1984 ahead of the Netherlands, defeated Malta by a score of 12–1 on the strength of &quot;nine&quot; second half goals. Especially in international football, such lopsided results are seen as unsavoury, even if they are honest. If anything, these incidents serves as evidence that the FIFA tie-breaker can cause incentives to perpetrate a fix in some circumstances, the UEFA tie-breaker in others.

Tie-breaking rules played the central role in one of cricket&#x27;s more notorious matches. In a 1979 match in England&#x27;s now-defunct Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, a one-day league, Worcestershire hosted Somerset in the final group match for both sides. Going into that match, Somerset led their group with three wins from three matches, but would end in a three-way tie for the top spot if they lost to Worcestershire and Glamorgan defeated the then-winless Minor Counties South. In that event, the tie-breaker would be bowling strike rate. The Somerset players calculated that a large enough loss could see them miss the quarter-finals. Accordingly, Somerset captain Brian Rose determined that if Somerset batted first and declared their innings closed after one over, they would protect their strike rate advantage, assuring advancement to the quarter-finals. When Somerset won the toss, Rose implemented the plan, batting in the first partnership and declaring at the close of the first over after Somerset scored only one run on a no-ball. Worcestershire won during their second over. Rose&#x27;s strategy, although not against the letter of the rules, was condemned by media and cricket officials, and the Test and County Cricket Board (predecessor to the current England and Wales Cricket Board) voted to expel Somerset from that season&#x27;s competition.

===Prize sharing===
A player can concede with the understanding that the opponent will share the prize equally with him or her. Depending on the game, this can lead to disqualification.

===Protest action===
On occasion, teams tank games as a protest against actions in earlier games. The most lopsided professional football match in history, AS Adema 149–0 SO l&#x27;Emyrne, was a result of SO l&#x27;Emyrne intentionally losing the game in protest against the referee&#x27;s action in a previous game.

===Conflicts of interest===
Sometimes, fixing or tanking may simply be motivated by ownership having controlling interests in two or more teams. In such circumstances, there is often incentive for the common owners&#x27; poorer team to deliberately lose to a championship contender, or at least to make roster and/or coaching decisions that increase the contenders&#x27; chances of winning.

Such collusion is often not limited to individual games, rather, owners may deliberately try to transfer all of their best players to the more lucrative team. A particularly notorious example occurred in the 1899 Major League Baseball season when the owners of the Cleveland Spiders bought a more profitable team, the St. Louis Perfectos, and brazenly traded Cleveland&#x27;s best players to St. Louis. The Spiders finished the season 20–134 (by far the worst record in MLB history) and were contracted after the season.

Modern major sports leagues usually prohibit such ownership arrangements. Where it is necessary or desirable for a single ownership group to control two teams, salary caps often limit the ability of owners to stack one roster at the expense of another. Typically, to forestall so much as any perception of impropriety, such teams will be prohibited from trading directly with each other and any head-to-head match(es) will usually be scheduled early in the season to ensure there are no obvious championship and/or playoff implications. An example of this arrangement occurred in the early 21st century in the Canadian Football League; between 2010 and 2015, the BC Lions and the Toronto Argonauts were owned by the same person.

===Individual performance in team sports===
Bookmakers in the early 21st century accept bets on a far wider range of sports-related propositions than ever before. Thus, a gambling-motivated fix might not necessarily involve any direct attempt to influence the outright result, especially in team sports in which such a fix would require the co-operation (and prerequisitely the knowledge) of many people and/or perhaps would be more likely to arouse suspicion. Fixing the result of a more-particular proposition might be seen as less likely to be noticed. For example, the disgraced former National Basketball Association referee Tim Donaghy has been alleged to have perpetrated some of his fixes by calling games in such a manner as to ensure more points than expected were scored by both teams, thus affecting &quot;over-under&quot; bets on the games whilst also ensuring that Donaghy at least did not look to be outright biased. Also, bets are increasingly being taken on individual performances in team sporting events, which, in turn, has seen the rise of a phenomenon known as spot fixing although it is now unlikely that enough is bet on average players to allow someone to place a substantial wager on them without being noticed.

One such attempt was described by retired footballer Matthew Le Tissier, who in 2009 admitted that while he was playing with Southampton FC back in 1995, he tried (and failed) to kick the ball out of play right after the kick-off of a Premier League match against Wimbledon FC so that a group of associates would collect on a wager made on an early throw-in. Likewise, a tennis pro was paid to make sure she lost her first service game. She was free to play normally for the rest of the match.

Similarly, in 2010, Pakistani cricket players were accused of committing specific no-ball penalties for the benefit of gamblers. The scandal centred on three Pakistani players accepting bribes from a bookmaker, Mazhar Majeed, during the Lord&#x27;s test match against England. Following investigations by the News of the World and Scotland Yard, on 1 November 2011, Majeed, Pakistan&#x27;s captain, Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were found guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and to accept corrupt payments. As a result, all three of the players were banned by the International Cricket Council (ICC): Butt for ten years, Asif for seven and Amir for five. On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years eight months for Majeed.

===Effect of non-gambling-motivated fixing on wagering===
Whenever any serious motivation for teams to manipulate results becomes apparent to the general public, there can be a corresponding effect on betting markets as honest gamblers speculate in good faith as to the chance such a fix might be attempted. Some bettors might choose to avoid wagering on such a fixture while others will be motivated to wager on it, or alter the bet they would otherwise place. Such actions will invariably affect odds and point spreads even if there is no contact whatsoever between teams and the relevant gambling interests. The rise of betting exchanges has allowed such speculation to play out in real time.

==History==
Evidence of match fixing has been found throughout recorded history, and the history of match fixing is closely related to the history of illegal gambling.

The ancient Olympic Games were almost constantly dealing with allegations of athletes accepting bribes to lose a competition and city-states which often tried to manipulate the outcome with large amounts of money. These activities went on despite the oath each athlete took to protect the integrity of the events and the severe punishment sometimes inflicted on those who were caught. Chariot racing was also dogged by race fixing throughout its history.

By the end of the 19th century gambling was illegal in most jurisdictions, but that did not stop its widespread practice. Boxing soon became rife with fighters &quot;taking a dive&quot;, likely due to boxing being a sport involving individual competitors, which makes its matches much easier to fix without getting caught. Baseball also became plagued by match fixing despite efforts by the National League to stop gambling at its games. Matters finally came to a head in 1919 when eight members of the Chicago White Sox threw the World Series. In an effort to restore confidence, Major League Baseball established the office of the Commissioner of Baseball, and one of Kenesaw Mountain Landis&#x27;s first acts was to ban all involved players for life.

MLB Rule 21 prohibits players from participating in any form of betting on baseball games, and a lifetime ban for betting on a player&#x27;s own games. A poster with Rule 21 must be posted on all professional baseball clubhouses.

In the 1990s, match fixing in Asia was especially common. In Malaysia, authorities suggested that 70% of football matches were being manipulated, and corruption scandals in China resulted in gamblers choosing to bet on overseas matches.

===Japan===

 is a Japanese word meaning a cheating activity which is committed at places where a match, fight, game, competition, or other contest, is held, where the winner and loser are decided in advance by agreement of the competitors or related people. It is believed that the word &quot;Yaocho&quot; came from the name (&quot;Chobei&quot;) of the owner of a vegetable stand (&quot;yaoya&quot;) during the Meiji period. Created from the first syllable of &quot;Yaoya&quot; and &quot;chobei&quot;, the word &quot;yaocho&quot; was created for a nickname of Chobei. Chobei had a friend called &quot;Isenoumi Godayu&quot; (7th Isenoumi stablemaster) with whom he played the game Igo, who had once been a sumo wrestler &quot;Kashiwado Sogoro&quot; (former &quot;shikona&quot;: &quot;Kyonosato&quot;) and now was a &quot;toshiyori&quot; (a stablemaster of sumo). Although Chobei was a better Igo player than Isenoumi, he sometimes lost games on purpose to please Isenoumi so that Isenoumi would continue to buy merchandise from his shop. Afterward, once people knew of his cheating, they started to use &quot;yaocho&quot; as a word meaning any decision to win/lose a match in advance by negotiation etc. with the expectation of secondary profit, even though the match seems to be held seriously and fairly.

Economists using statistical analysis have shown very strong evidence of bout fixing in sumo wrestling. Most of the motive for match fixing is helping each other&#x27;s ranking to keep their salary higher, according to Keisuke Itai. For example, wrestlers in &quot;jūryō&quot; (the second tier) desperately try to avoid finishing the tournament with a losing record (7–8 or worse) and exchange or buy the match result, or their salary would be nothing, 0 yen, with the participation wage of 150,000 yen every two months if they finish the tournament with a losing record, and their ranking would go down to &quot;makushita&quot; (third level) and only participate in seven matches, the lesser ranking from &quot;jūryō&quot; in which one can earn 1,036,000 yen monthly with some prizes and a full 15-match tournament.

The sumo association appears to make a distinction between &quot;yaocho&quot; (the payment of money to secure a result) and &quot;koi-ni-yatta mukiryoku zumo&quot; (the deliberate performance of underpowered sumo in which an opponent simply lays a match down without exchange of money). The intricacies of Japanese culture, which include subordination of individual gain to the greater good and knowing how to read a situation without the exchange of words (I know my opponent&#x27;s score, he needs help, and I should automatically give it to him) mean that the latter is almost readily accepted in the sumo world and is also nearly impossible to prove.

===Cricket===
Some of the most notorious instances of match fixing have been observed in international cricket. In 2000 the Delhi police intercepted a conversation between a blacklisted bookie and the South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje in which they learnt that Cronje accepted money to throw matches. A court of inquiry was set up and Cronje admitted to throwing matches. He was immediately banned from all cricket. He also named Saleem Malik (Pakistan), Mohammed Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja (India) as fellow match fixers. Jadeja was banned for 4 years. Although Cronje was a kingpin of betting, following untimely death in 2002 most of his fixing partners escaped law enforcement agencies. Earlier in 1998, Australian players Mark Waugh and Shane Warne were fined for revealing information about the &#x27;weather&#x27; to a bookmaker.

The fourth Test of Pakistan&#x27;s summer 2010 cricket tour of England contained several incidents of spot fixing, involving members of Pakistan team deliberately bowling no-balls at specific points to facilitate betting through bookmakers. Following investigation, three Pakistani players were banned from cricket and sentenced to prison terms. Similarly, in Indian Premier League in 2013, S. Sreesanth and two other players were banned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India for alleged match fixing. Sreesanth&#x27;s ban was briefly lifted, but the Kerala High Court upheld the ban in 2017.

In July 2017, ex-Sri Lanka cricket captain Arjuna Ranatunga alleged that the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final match between India and Sri Lanka had been fixed. The investigation was dropped by Sri Lankan authorities and the International Cricket Council in 2020 due to a lack of evidence.

In July 2022, it was reported that local authorities had shut down an operation in Gujarat, India, that had been running a fictitious, kayfabe version of the Indian Premier League in an attempt to scam Russian sports betters. The matches took place on a field with floodlights, with players dressed in replica jerseys of real IPL teams; based on bets received on a Telegram channel, umpires instructed the players and &quot;referees&quot; to perform specific plays and calls. Broadcasts of the &quot;matches&quot; were streamed on YouTube, and utilized artificial crowd noise, a sound-alike of cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, and camera angles that never showed clear shots of the pitch, players, or deliveries. The participating players were paid 400 rupees per-game, and the operation was estimated to have scammed punters out of 300,000 rupees before it was shut down by police. The actual 2022 Indian Premier League had already concluded at the end of May.

===Association football===
In 2006 the European football powerhouse Juventus FC drew a match against minnows Rimini in a fixed encounter. Following investigation, Juventus Manager Luciano Moggi, Italian Football President Franco Carraro and Vice-president Innocenzo Mazzini had to resign In 2010 several Korean footballers were punished by FIFA with a lifelong ban from all sports for fixing several matches in the Korean League Cup. During the subsequent investigation, many top Korean players were also found to be involved in match fixing after the initial discovery.

===Professional wrestling===

In professional wrestling, most matches have predetermined results; however, as it is an open secret that professional wrestling is staged, it is not considered match fixing.

Up until the 1920s, professional wrestling was considered a legitimate sport. This did not endure as professional wrestling became identified with modern theatrics or &quot;admitted fakery&quot;, moving away from actual competition. The &quot;worked&quot;, known as &quot;kayfabe&quot; nature of wrestling led critics to deem it an illegitimate sport, particularly in comparison to boxing, amateur wrestling, and, more recently, mixed martial arts.

Many individuals began to doubt the legitimacy of wrestling after the retirement of Frank Gotch in 1913. As wrestling&#x27;s popularity was diving around the same time that Major League Baseball had its own legitimacy issues, wrestling started to take on a more worked approach while still appearing as a legitimate sport, beginning with the Gold Dust Trio of the 1920s. Even after the formation of the National Wrestling Alliance in 1948, wrestling continued to have legitimacy issues.

Nevertheless, wrestling was still regulated by state athletic commissions in the United States well into the 1980s, until Vince McMahon, owner of the World Wrestling Federation, convinced the state of New Jersey in 1989 that wrestling was considered a form of entertainment (or &quot;sports entertainment&quot;, as McMahon used) rather than as a legitimate sport, and that it should not be regulated by state athletic commissions. The move was seen as more of a relief to those who had questioned wrestling&#x27;s legitimacy, since at least one major company (in this case, the WWF) was now publicly willing to admit that wrestling was staged; however, the move did anger many wrestling purists.

Due to the lingering legitimacy issues that surrounded wrestling from the 1910s until the 1980s, gambling was generally not allowed on wrestling matches while it was still considered a legitimate sport. Despite wrestling having openly acknowledged that the results are predetermined for years, since the late 2000s gambling has increased on wrestling events, though the maximum bets are kept low due to the matches being predetermined. By contrast, when the WWF co-founded an American football league with NBC known as the XFL (which played for a single season in 2001), the league had to emphasize that its games were not staged in this manner (despite drawing upon wrestling, and in particular the WWF&#x27;s &quot;Attitude Era&quot;, in its overall image and presentation), and specifically promoted the willingness of Las Vegas bookmakers to take wagers on the games as evidence of its legitimacy.

=== Quiz shows ===

In the 1950s, the producers of several televised quiz shows in the United States were found to have engaged in match fixing, as part of an effort to boost viewer interest and ratings. Geritol, the sponsor of the new quiz show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, showed concerns over the poor performance of its early contestants—which they felt were causing the show to trail behind its main competitor, &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;. At the time, the majority of television programs were effectively controlled by their single sponsors, with broadcasters only providing studios and airtime. Geritol demanded that Barry &amp; Enright Productions make changes to the show, which included the outright choreography of contestants around predetermined outcomes.

The most infamous example of this strategy came when champion Herbert Stempel was to be replaced by Charles Van Doren—a Columbia University English teacher whom the producers felt would be more popular with viewers. On &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, winners of matches received $500 for every point within their margin of victory, but this pot increased by $500 after every tie game. To build anticipation for the episode where Van Doren would defeat Stempel, the first episode of their match was played to three tie games; this meant that the next game would be played for $2,000 per-point. After one more tie game, Stempel threw the match to Van Doren by answering specific questions incorrectly. Among them, he incorrectly guessed that &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; was the winner of the Best Picture award at the 28th Academy Awards. The correct answer was &quot;Marty&quot;, which was also one of Stempel&#x27;s favorite films.

The cancellation of the competing quiz &quot;Dotto&quot; under similar allegations prompted a U.S. government investigation into both it and &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. The investigation similarly revealed that Revlon—the sponsor of &quot;The $64,000 Question&quot;—had instructed the show&#x27;s producers to balance its questions more favorably towards contestants they felt would be more popular among viewers (although it stopped short of outright rigging games to the same extent as &quot;Twenty-One&quot;). The scandal resulted in regulations being implemented to prohibit the rigging of game shows and other contests by broadcasters.

===Esports===
Match fixing controversies have also emerged in Esports, including in particular &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, &quot;League of Legends&quot;, &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Paladins&quot;, &quot;StarCraft&quot;. Major scandals have included those of the iBuyPower and NetcodeGuides.com &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; teams, where it was found that the iBuyPower team had received around $10,000 worth of items via skin gambling—the practice of wagering &quot;CS:GO&quot; weapon skins in a similar manner to sports betting, based on real-world market values on Steam&#x27;s Community Market—after they threw matches in a major tournament. South Korean &quot;StarCraft II&quot; player Life was also convicted of having partaken in match fixing.

&quot;Dota 2&quot; matchfixing is most prominent in Chinese and SEA regions. Rustam &quot;Adekvat&quot; Mavliutov attributes this to a more complex structures with enough players of different skill:
Why does it happen more often in Asia? In my opinion - where there is more structuring in the environment, where the whole cyber sports part is better structured, specific tier-divisions are identified, a huge number of tournaments and leagues are built on this structure, then the appearance of 322-matches is most possible. This structure implies the participation of bookmakers, the presence of large prize money, investors and so on. Where there is money, there will be matchfixing. Roughly speaking, if we know for sure that in China there is the first, second league and the third division, about which less is known, but some teams also play there, we understand that there will naturally be rigged matches there. We have less of this, because we have fewer leagues. We don&#x27;t have a clear structure of tiers. We won&#x27;t be able to put together a league with twelve tier-2 teams. You can do that in China. More teams, bigger organisations, the percentage of rigged matches is also higher, that&#x27;s a fact.

===Protection against manipulation===
By monitoring the pre-match betting markets it is sometimes possible to detect planned match fixing. It is also possible to detect on-going match manipulation by looking at the in-game betting markets. Several federations have employed services that provide such systems for detecting match manipulation. Prior to the 2016 MLB season, Major League Baseball (MLB) hired Genius Sports, a sports technology company specialising in integrity, to monitor the betting patterns on all of their games. In addition, Interpol monitors and publishes major developments in match-fixing and corruption in sports around the world.

In addition, several federations run integrity tours where players and officials participate in educational workshops on how match fixing work and how they are prevented.

<text>Donald Patrick Conroy (October 26, 1945 – March 4, 2016) was an American author who wrote several acclaimed novels and memoirs; his books &quot;The Water is Wide&quot;, &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot;, &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; and &quot;The Great Santini&quot; were made into films, the last two being nominated for Oscars. He is recognized as a leading figure of late-20th-century Southern literature.

==Early life==
Born in Atlanta, Georgia, Patrick &quot;Pat&quot; Conroy was the eldest of seven children (five boys and two girls) born to Marine Colonel Donald Conroy, of Chicago, Illinois, and the former Frances &quot;Peggy&quot; Peek of Alabama. His father was a Marine Corps fighter pilot, and Conroy moved often in his youth, attending 11 schools by the time he was 15. He did not have a hometown until his family settled in Beaufort, South Carolina, where he finished high school. During his senior year in high school, he was a protégé of Ann Head who was an influence on his future writing. His alma mater is The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina in Charleston, where he graduated from the Corps of Cadets as an English major.

Conroy had said his stories were heavily influenced by his military brat upbringing, and in particular, difficulties experienced with his own father, a US Marine Corps pilot, who was physically and emotionally abusive toward his children. The pain of a youth growing up in a harsh environment is evident in Conroy&#x27;s novels, which use autobiographical material, particularly &quot;The Great Santini&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot;. While living in Orlando, Florida, Conroy&#x27;s fifth-grade basketball team defeated a team of sixth graders, making the sport his prime outlet for bottled-up emotions for more than a dozen years. Conroy also cites his family&#x27;s frequent military-related moves and growing up immersed in military culture as significant influences in his life (in both positive and negative ways).

A standout athlete, he was recruited to The Citadel to play basketball; his 2002 book &quot;My Losing Season&quot; focused on his experiences playing his senior year, and like &quot;The Lords of Discipline,&quot; also served as a retrospective of his cadet years.

==Writing career==
As a graduate of The Citadel&#x27;s Corps of Cadets, his experiences at The Citadel provided the basis for two of his best-known works, the novel &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; and the memoir &quot;My Losing Season&quot;. The latter details his senior year on the school&#x27;s underdog basketball team, which won the longest game in the history of Southern Conference basketball against rival Virginia Military Institute in quadruple overtime in 1967.

His first book, &quot;The Boo&quot;, is a collection of anecdotes about cadet life centering on Lt. Colonel Thomas Nugent Courvousie, who had served as Assistant Commandant of Cadets at The Citadel from 1961 to 1968; Courvoisie was the inspiration for the fictional character Colonel Thomas Berrineau, a.k.a. &quot;The Bear&quot;, in &quot;The Lords Of Discipline&quot;. Conroy began the book in 1968, after learning that Lt. Colonel Courvoisie had been removed from his position as assistant commandant and given a job in the warehouse; he paid to self-publish the book, borrowing the money from a bank.

After graduating from The Citadel, Conroy taught English in Beaufort, South Carolina; while there he met and married Barbara Jones, a young widow of the Vietnam War who was pregnant with her second child. He then accepted a job teaching children in a one-room schoolhouse on remote Daufuskie Island, South Carolina. 
Conroy was fired at the conclusion of his first year on the island for his unconventional teaching practices, including his refusal to use corporal punishment on students, and for his lack of respect for the school&#x27;s administration. He later wrote &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; based on his experiences as a teacher. The book won Conroy a humanitarian award from the National Education Association and an Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. It was also made into a feature film, &quot;Conrack&quot;, starring Jon Voight in 1974. Hallmark produced a television version of the book in 2006.

In 1976, Conroy published his novel, &quot;The Great Santini&quot;. The main character of the novel is Marine fighter pilot Colonel &quot;Bull&quot; Meecham, who dominates and terrorizes his family. Bull Meecham also psychologically abuses his teenage son Ben. The character is based on Conroy&#x27;s father Donald. (According to &quot;My Losing Season&quot;, Donald Conroy was even worse than the character depicted in &quot;Santini&quot;.)

&quot;The Great Santini&quot; caused friction within the Conroy family, who felt that he had betrayed family secrets by writing about his father. According to Conroy, members of his mother&#x27;s family would picket his book signings, passing out pamphlets asking people not to buy the novel. The friction contributed to the failure of his first marriage. However, the book also eventually helped repair Conroy&#x27;s relationship with his father, and they became very close. His father, looking to prove that he was not like the character in the book, changed his behavior drastically.

According to Conroy, his father would often sign copies of his son&#x27;s novels, &quot;I hope you enjoy my son&#x27;s latest work of fiction.&quot; He would underline the word &quot;fiction&quot; five or six times. &quot;That boy of mine sure has a vivid imagination. Ol&#x27; lovable, likable Col. Don Conroy, USMC (Ret.), the Great Santini.&quot; The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1979, starring Robert Duvall.

Publication of &quot;The Lords of Discipline&quot; in 1980 upset many of his fellow graduates of The Citadel, who felt that his portrayal of campus life was highly unflattering. The novel was adapted for the screenplay of a 1983 film of the same name, starring David Keith as Will McLean and Robert Prosky as Colonel &quot;Bear&quot; Berrineau. The rift was not healed until 2000, when Conroy was awarded an honorary degree and asked to deliver the commencement address the following year.

In 1986, Conroy published &quot;The Prince of Tides&quot; about Tom Wingo, an unemployed South Carolina teacher who goes to New York City to help his sister, Savannah, a poet who has attempted suicide, to come to terms with their past. The novel was made into a film of the same name in 1991. Directed by Barbra Streisand, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

In 1995, Conroy published &quot;Beach Music&quot;, a novel about an American expatriate living in Rome who returns to South Carolina upon news of his mother&#x27;s terminal illness. The story reveals his attempt to confront personal demons, including the suicide of his wife, the subsequent custody battle with his in-laws over their daughter, and the attempt by a film-making friend to rekindle old friendships which were compromised during the days of the Vietnam War.

In 2002, Pat Conroy published &quot;My Losing Season&quot; where he takes the reader through his last year playing basketball, as point guard and captain of the Citadel Bulldogs. &quot;The Pat Conroy Cookbook&quot;, published in 2004, is a collection of favorite recipes accompanied by stories about his life, including many stories of growing up in South Carolina. In 2009, Conroy published &quot;South of Broad&quot;, which again uses the familiar backdrop of Charleston following the suicide of newspaperman Leo King&#x27;s brother, and alternates narratives of a diverse group of friends between 1969 and 1989.

In May 2013, Conroy was named editor-at-large of Story River Books, a newly created fiction division of the University of South Carolina Press. In October 2013, four years after being first publicized, Conroy published a memoir called &quot;The Death of Santini&quot;, which recounts the volatile relationship he shared with his father up until his father&#x27;s death in 1998.

Conroy was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame on March 18, 2009.

==Military brat cultural identity and awareness movement==
Conroy was a major supporter of the research and writing efforts of journalist Mary Edwards Wertsch in her identification of the hidden subculture of American Military Brats, the children of career military families, who grow up moving constantly, deeply immersed in the military, and often personally affected by war.

=== Conroy&#x27;s essay on military childhood ===
In 1991, Wertsch &quot;launched the movement for military brat cultural identity&quot; with her book &quot;Military Brats: Legacies of Childhood inside the Fortress&quot;. In researching her book, Wertsch identified common themes from interviews of over 80 offspring of military households, including the special challenges, strengths and also the unique subculture experienced by American &quot;military brats&quot;. While this book does not purport to be a scientific study, subsequent research has validated many of her findings.

Conroy contributed a now widely circulated ten-page essay on American military childhood, including his own childhood, to Wertsch&#x27;s book, which was used as the introduction. It included the following:

===Conroy&#x27;s role in &quot;Brats: Our Journey Home&quot;===
Conroy also authorized the use of his work in the award-winning documentary &quot;&quot; directed by Donna Musil, that endeavors to bring the hidden subculture of military brats into greater public awareness, as well as aiding military brat self-awareness and support.

The documentary ends with a quote of Conroy about the invisibility of the military brat subculture to the wider American society. Conroy wrote, &quot;We spent our entire childhoods in the service of our country, and no one even knew we were there.&quot;

==Personal life==
Conroy was married three times. His first marriage was to Barbara (née Bolling) Jones on October 10, 1969, while he was teaching on Daufuskie Island. Jones, who had been Conroy&#x27;s next door neighbor in Beaufort, South Carolina, had been widowed when her first husband, Joseph Wester Jones III, a fighter pilot stationed in Vietnam, had been shot down and killed. Jones already had one daughter, Jessica, and was pregnant at the time of her husband&#x27;s death with their second child, Melissa. He adopted both girls after he married their mother, and then they had a daughter of their own, Megan. They divorced in 1977.

Conroy then married Lenore (née Gurewitz) Fleischer in 1981. He became the stepfather to her two children, Gregory and Emily, and the couple also had one daughter, to whom he dedicated his 2010 book &quot;My Reading Life&quot;, &quot;This book is dedicated to my lost daughter, Susannah Ansley Conroy. Know this: I love you with my heart and always will. Your return to my life would be one of the happiest moments I could imagine.&quot; Conroy and Fleischer divorced on October 26, 1995, Conroy&#x27;s 50th birthday. Conroy married his third wife, writer Cassandra King, in May 1998.

A friend of Conroy, political cartoonist Doug Marlette, died in a car accident in July 2007. Conroy and Joe Klein eulogized Marlette at the funeral. There were 10 eulogists in all, and Conroy called Marlette his best friend, and said: &quot;The first person to cry, when he heard about Doug&#x27;s death, was God&quot;.

Conroy lived in Beaufort with wife Cassandra until his death. In 2007, he commented that she was a much happier writer than he was: &quot;I&#x27;ll hear her cackle with laughter at some funny line she&#x27;s written. I&#x27;ve never cackled with laughter at a single line I&#x27;ve ever written. None of it has given me pleasure. She writes with pleasure and joy, and I sit there in gloom and darkness.&quot;

As an adult, Conroy suffered from depression, had several breakdowns and contemplated suicide. He attempted suicide in the mid-1970s while writing &quot;The Great Santini&quot;.

==Death==
On February 15, 2016, Conroy stated on his Facebook page that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. He died on March 4, 2016, at 70 years old. Conroy&#x27;s funeral was held on March 8, 2016, at St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church in Beaufort, South Carolina.

Pat Conroy is buried in St. Helena Memorial Gardens cemetery (Ernest Drive, Saint Helena Island 29920) near the Penn Center. The Penn Center is a National Historic Landmark that provided educational facilities to freed Gullah slaves after the Civil War and continues to serve as an African-American cultural and educational center.

==Legacy==

Located in Beaufort, South Carolina, the Pat Conroy Literary Center was incorporated as a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization on March 19, 2016. The center, which houses a collection of Conroy memorabilia, seeks to &quot;continue his legacy in the magnificent coastal landscape where his storytelling began and beyond, supporting a vibrant literary community that reflects Pat Conroy’s undying delight in the power of the human voice.&quot; In 2017, the Pat Conroy Literary Center was designated a Literary Landmark by the American Library Association. The same year, it became the first site in South Carolina to be selected as an affiliate of the American Writers Museum.

The Pat Conroy Literary Center hosts a number of educational activities and cultural events, including an annual literary festival.

The Citadel in 2018 announced the Pat Conroy Writer’s Residency Fellowship to be given to a Bulldogs basketball player each season each year.

<text>In Greek mythology, Tlepolemus (; ) was the leader of the Rhodian forces in the Trojan War.

== Family ==
Tlepolemus was a son of Heracles and Astyoche, daughter of Phylas, king of Ephyra. Though some sources say that his mother was Astydameia, daughter of Amyntor or Ormenus.

== Mythology ==
Tlepolemus fled to Rhodes after slaying Licymnius, Heracles&#x27; aged maternal uncle. According to the &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, this was an accident—Tlepolemus was beating a servant when Licymnius ran between the two, suffering a fatal blow,—but Pindar states that the death was intentional and motivated by anger. Accompanied by his Argive wife Polyxo, Tlepolemus made passage to Rhodes and divided the island into three parts, founding three Rhodian city-states: Cameirus, Ialysus and Lindus.

Hyginus lists Tlepolemus among the suitors of Helen; thus bound by the oath of Tyndareus, he was among the Greek allies in the campaign against Troy, leading a force of nine ships.

He encountered Sarpedon on the first day of fighting recounted in the &quot;Iliad&quot; and taunted him saying that he lacked courage and could not really be the son of Zeus. Tlepolemus then attacked him, and although he wounded Sarpedon, he was slain by the latter.

According to Pausanias, Polyxo killed Helen to avenge for her husband&#x27;s death, though Polyaenus says that Menelaus had dressed up a servant in Helen&#x27;s clothes and that the Rhodians killed her instead as Menelaus and Helen escaped.

<text>Anne Brown (August 9, 1912March 13, 2009) was an American lyric soprano for whom George Gershwin rewrote the part of &quot;Bess&quot; into a leading role in the original production of his opera &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1935.

She was also a radio and concert singer. She settled in Norway in 1948 and later became a Norwegian citizen.

==Early life and career (1912–1936)==
A native of Baltimore, Maryland, Annie Wiggins Brown was the daughter of Dr. Harry F. Brown, a physician, and his wife, the former Mary Allen Wiggins. Her father was the grandson of a slave and her mother&#x27;s parents were of black, Cherokee Indian, and Scottish-Irish origins. She had three sisters, Henrietta, Mamie, and Harriet.

As an African-American, she was not allowed to attend a Roman Catholic elementary school in her native Baltimore. She trained at Morgan College and then applied to the Peabody Institute, but was rejected from the school due to her race.

Brown then applied to the Juilliard School in New York at the encouragement of the wife of the owner of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. She was admitted to Juilliard when she was 16, becoming the first African-American vocalist to attend there. She studied singing with Lucia Dunham and was awarded Juilliard&#x27;s Margaret McGill scholarship when she was 20 years old. At the age of nineteen she married a fellow Juilliard student, but the marriage soon ended in divorce.

In 1933, she was a second-year graduate student at Juilliard. She learned that George Gershwin was going to compose an opera about African Americans in South Carolina. She decided to write him a letter, which led to Gershwin&#x27;s secretary calling her to come and sing for him. After singing several classical arias and the spiritual &quot;A City Called Heaven&quot; for Gershwin, Brown was frequently invited by the composer to come down and sing parts of the opera for him as he was composing the work&#x27;s music. As a result, the role of Bess grew from a secondary character, like it was in DuBose Heyward&#x27;s novel &quot;Porgy&quot;, to one of the opera&#x27;s leading roles. Brown recalled that: 
[Gershwin] would telephone and say, &#x27;I&#x27;ve finished up to page 33 or so. Come down; I want you to sing it. When can you come down?&#x27; &#x27;When I get out of school today,&#x27; I would say. I&#x27;d always start off singing &quot;Summertime&quot;. I loved it so. Then I would sing whatever he had written since the last time I&#x27;d been there, whatever the roles might be – sometimes I even sang Sportin&#x27; Life, sometimes we sang duets together. I knew that opera before I went onstage, not only the songs. I wound up playing about 500 performances in the original and then the 1942 revival. I can tell you what every instrument played. Finally, in our last days of rehearsals in New York before heading up to Boston for previews, George took me to lunch. &#x27;Come on,&#x27; he said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to buy you an orange juice.&#x27; Then, when we were seated, he made this announcement. I remember his words exactly because they thrilled me so. &#x27;I want you to know, Miss Brown,&#x27; he said, &#x27;that henceforth and forever after, George Gershwin&#x27;s opera will be known as &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;.

Brown took part of opera history when she sang Bess for the world premiere of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on September 30, 1935 – the try-out for a work intended initially for Broadway where the opening took place at the Alvin Theater in New York City on October 10, 1935. The production was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and ran on Broadway for 124 performances. Olin Downes in &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised Brown&#x27;s performance as &quot;a high point of interpretation.&quot; Critical responses to the work were mixed; some reviewers were uncertain as to whether or not &quot;Porgy&quot; was a folk opera, musical comedy, jazz drama, or something completely different. Others expressed concerns over the use of &quot;negro stereotypes&quot;. Brown said, &quot;My father was very displeased. He thought that those were the old cliches of black people – dope peddlers, near-prostitutes; he especially didn&#x27;t like his daughter showing her legs and all that. I thought that DuBose Heyward and Gershwin had simply taken a part of life in Catfish Row, South Carolina, and rendered it superbly.&quot;

Following the show&#x27;s run on Broadway, a United States tour started on January 27, 1936, in Philadelphia and traveled to Pittsburgh and Chicago before ending in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 1936. During the Washington run, the cast—as led by Todd Duncan— protested segregation at the theater. Brown said of her role in the protest, &quot;I told them: &#x27;I will not sing at the National. If my mother, my father, my friends, if black people cannot come hear me sing, then count me out.&#x27; I remember Gershwin saying to me, &#x27;You&#x27;re not going to sing?&#x27; And I said to him, &#x27;I can&#x27;t sing!&#x27;&quot; Eventually management gave in to the demands, resulting in the first integrated audience for a performance of any show at the National Theatre. When the curtain came down on the final performance of &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; segregation was reinstated.

==Later life and career: 1937–2009==

After her appearance as the first Bess, Brown returned to Broadway in the 1937 musical revue &quot;Pins and Needles&quot;. This was later followed by an appearance in the 1939 Broadway play &quot;Mamba&#x27;s Daughters&quot; in the roles of Gardenia and the &quot;Lonesome Walls&quot; Singer. Brown sang Bess in several revivals of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; during this time, including the 1942 Broadway revival. She also sang Bess for the Decca Records album &quot;Selections from George Gershwin&#x27;s folk opera Porgy and Bess&quot; and sang some of Bess&#x27;s music in an appearance in the 1945 Gershwin biography film &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;.

Brown toured Europe as a concert artist from 1942 to 1948. Brown said that she left the United States because of continued racial prejudice. As she told &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1998, &quot;We tough girls tough it out. I&#x27;ve lived a strange kind of life—half black, half white, half isolated, half in the spotlight. Many things that I wanted as a young person for my career were denied to me because of my color&quot;. She also noted, regarding her light complexion, &quot;Though there is no place on earth without prejudice. In fact, a French journalist wrote an article during one of my tours there asking: &#x27;Why does she say she is colored? She&#x27;s as white as any singer. It&#x27;s just a trick to get people interested.&#x27; Can you imagine? Of course I was advertised as &#x27;a Negro soprano.&#x27; What is &#x27;a Negro soprano&#x27;?&quot; She also stated that she felt her singing was better received in Europe because she mainly sang works by European composers, such as Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, and Mahler.

In 1948, Brown settled in Oslo, Norway and became a Norwegian citizen after marrying skier Thorleif Schjelderup, a medalist at the 1948 Winter Olympics. He was her third husband, and like her previous marriages, their union ended in divorce. The marriage to Schjelderup was her third, his second. She had married for the first time at 19, eloping with a medical student, F. H. Howard, in New York and keeping the marriage secret from her father for two years; the union ended two years after that. Her second marriage in 1938 to C. C. Pettit produced her daughter, Paula, who was born in 1939. She had a second daughter, Vaar Inga, born in 1951 (the name means &quot;springtime&quot; in Norwegian), with Schjelderup, who also adopted Paula. Paula Schjelderup rarely saw her father, because of her parents’ poor relationship. Instead, Schjelderup considered Brown’s husband, Thorleif Schjelderup, to be her father figure.

Brown continued working as a professional musician into the 1950s, mostly working as a concert singer and recitalist. She did. however, appear in a few more operas, like Gian Carlo Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Medium&quot; and &quot;The Telephone&quot;. Her career as a singer was cut short due to problems with asthma; she no longer sang professionally after 1955. (She sang at the Teatro Colón in October 1955.) At this point, she embarked on a second career as a voice teacher. Among her students were actress Liv Ullmann, soprano Elizabeth Norberg-Schulz, ballad singer and former Minister of Culture Åse Kleveland, jazz singer Karin Krog, and opera singer Trond Halstein Moe. On October 9, 1980, Brown was interviewed for an article written by James A. Standifier called, &quot;Reminiscences of Black Musicians&quot;. Brown also staged several operas in France and Norway. Brown was a guest of honor at the gala opening of the Oslo Opera House on April 12, 2008. She resided in Oslo up until her death in 2009 at age ninety-six. Her interment was at Vår Frelsers gravlund.

It is not clear if she maintained her United States citizenship as well. Her papers and personal artifacts are housed in the Amistad Research Center at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Awards==
In 1998, Anne Brown received the George Peabody Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Music in America from the Peabody Institute, the institution that had denied her music education 70 years earlier. She was also made an honorary citizen of Baltimore in 1999. In 2000, she was awarded Norway&#x27;s Council of Cultures Honorary Award.

<doc id="678978" wikidata="Q6387079" url="?curid=678978" title="Kemper Military School">
<text>Kemper Military School &amp; College was a private military school located in Boonville, Missouri. Founded in 1844, Kemper filed for bankruptcy and closed in 2002. The school&#x27;s motto was &quot;Nunquam Non Paratus&quot; (Never Not Prepared).

The 46-acre campus played a key role in Boonville&#x27;s identity as a popular 19th-century Missouri river town. Boonville has more than 400 antebellum and other architectural sites on the National Register of Historic Places, including Kemper. Its core historic buildings are included in Historic District A.
==History==
===Early years under Frederick T. Kemper===
On June 3, 1844, Frederick T. Kemper (1816–1881) gave his first lesson at the “Boonville Boarding School”, an all-male school designed to educate the sons of the frontier West. It started as a one-room schoolhouse on the corner of Spring and Main streets, and opened with five students. By the fall of 1844, it had 50 students. Its first year being a success, Mr. Kemper had the south wing of the long-time administration building constructed in 1845, and utilized the site as both a boarding school and as classroom space. Operating the school essentially by himself, Kemper changed the school&#x27;s name quite regularly. From 1844 through 1899, it was known variously as the Boonville Boarding School, Male Collegiate Institute, Kemper Family School, Kemper &amp; Taylor Institute, and the Kemper School.

In 1856, the school closed when Professor Kemper accepted a teaching and administrative position at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri. However, in 1861 he returned to Boonville and reopened the school as the “Kemper &amp; Taylor Institute” in partnership with his wife&#x27;s brother, Edwin H. Taylor. It was one of only a few schools in the state to remain open during the Civil War, partly due to Professor Kemper&#x27;s willingness to accept female students for the first time. Kemper prudently chose to keep a guarded neutrality throughout the war. However, it was widely known that his brother was Confederate General James L. Kemper, who gained fame as a primary participant in Pickett&#x27;s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg, and later became governor of Virginia. Kemper graduates fought on both sides during the war, and many participated in the local Battle of Boonville. After the war, Taylor left and the school again became all-male. Kemper continued to run the school, known again as &quot;Kemper Family School&quot;, until his death in 1881.

===Transition to a military school===
Kemper&#x27;s successor, alumnus Thomas A. Johnston, guided the school through its largest period of growth and established its national reputation. He was known as the &quot;Builder of the School&quot;, and oversaw the transition to a military school. During the 1880s, five other schools in Missouri added formal military training to their operation. Kemper students had been required to wear West Point-style grey uniforms to promote a &quot;feeling of equality&quot; among the students since at least the early 1870s. Kemper&#x27;s 1873 school catalogue also indicated that the school had hired a &quot;Drill Master&quot; to oversee the military side of the operations, but Johnston wanted to go a step further. By the mid-1880s, Johnston became &quot;carried away with the idea...that military training for boys and future citizens had great educational value&quot;, according to Colonel A.M. Hitch&#x27;s &quot;Centennial History of Kemper&quot;. &quot;He adopted a military training program and structure in 1885, employing as military instructor a recent graduate of Virginia Military Institute, and from that day to this, the military feature has been a prominent one in Kemper life.&quot; The school changed its name to Kemper Military School in 1899, and began to advertise itself as &quot;The West Point of the West&quot;.

Kemper&#x27;s most famous alumnus, Will Rogers, attended the school in the 1890s. Rogers went on to gain worldwide fame as an actor, humorist, political commentator and performer.

===Era of growth===
The campus expanded from 1900 to 1925. The major growth in the physical plant began in 1904 when &quot;B&quot; barracks was enlarged, then &quot;Math Hall&quot; was built in 1906 (originally as a gymnasium), &quot;A&quot; Barracks (or Harvey Barracks) was erected in 1909, &quot;D&quot; Barracks in 1917, and the Johnston Field House and the indoor pool were constructed in 1924.

There was a corresponding growth in enrollment. During F.T. Kemper&#x27;s era, the school usually had around 50 students. By 1900, enrollment was around 100, and by 1915, it was up to 150. During World War I, enrollment soared, peaking at 502 students in 1918 – almost more than the school could handle. During the 1920s, enrollment remained strong, in the mid-300s.

Many traditions were established. The &quot;Kemperite&quot; was first published in 1912. Kemper&#x27;s Standard of Honor was introduced in 1915. A formal ROTC program was begun in 1916, and in 1923, a junior college was added. By that time, the annual football game with rival Wentworth Military Academy and College in Lexington, Missouri had become a huge event on Thanksgiving, with both corps of cadets boarding trains and sometimes meeting on a neutral field in Sedalia or Marshall, Missouri. The Kansas City and St. Louis newspapers referred to the gridiron battle as the “Little Army-Navy Game”, and gave front-page coverage to the outcome.

===From the Great Depression to post-World War II prosperity===
In 1928, Colonel Johnston announced his retirement and his successor: Colonel Arthur M. Hitch, his son-in-law and principal since 1907. Hitch ably guided the school through the severe financial crisis of the Great Depression, when enrollment plummeted, and into World War II, during which the school operated year-round with over 500 students. During Hitch&#x27;s presidency, the new stadium and football fields were constructed in 1937, Academic Hall was built in 1939, and Science Hall was added in 1941. Colonel A.M. Hitch retired in 1948 and selected the son of Colonel T. A. Johnston, Colonel Harris Johnston, as the new superintendent. Johnston served for eight years, until 1956.

===Decline===
Kemper Military School survived the Mexican–American War, Civil War, Spanish–American War, World War I, World War II, Korean War and Vietnam War, and lasted into the 21st Century.

In 1956, the school went nonprofit, and the leadership of the school passed from the &quot;Old Guard&quot; and became much less stable. In the first 112 years of Kemper&#x27;s history only four men had led the school. After 1956, no Superintendent served for more than a few years. Major General Joseph P. Cleland, a 1921 Kemper graduate, became superintendent in 1956, the Reverend Sam West in 1959, Frederick J. Marston in 1962, Colonel James P. Kelly in 1964, Dr. Joseph B. Black in 1969, Colonel Carroll S. Meek in 1973, Wilbur Windsor in 1974, General William H. Blakefield in 1976, General Loyd P. Rhiddlehoover in 1980, Colonel Frank Duggins in 1984, Colonel Roger Harms in 1985, Charles W. Stewart in 1993, and Edward Ridgley in 1999.

The unstable management hurt most in the early 1970s, when many military schools struggled because of double-digit inflation and anti-military backlash caused by the Vietnam War. Enrollment, which peaked at 544 students in the mid-1960s, bottomed out when just 89 cadets showed up in 1976. The school piled up debt, but was able to keep its doors open. The school employed different tactics to get enrollment up, including admitting female cadets in the 1970s, reviving junior college football in the 1980s, and instituting more liberal admissions policies. Kemper seemed to be on the upswing for brief periods during the 1980s and the 1990s.

In 2000, Kemper shut down the junior college and its expensive athletic program. The junior college football team, in particular, was a big money loser for the school, but achieved great on-field success and actually produced a number of NFL players, including Jamal Williams, long-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle for the San Diego Chargers, and future Green Bay Packers Torrance Marshall, the MVP of the 2001 Orange Bowl for the National Champion Oklahoma Sooners. For many years, Kemper was also one of six military junior colleges that participated in the Army&#x27;s two-year Early Commissioning Program (ECP), an Army ROTC program through which a qualified student could earn a commission as a second lieutenant after only two years of college. At one time, ECP was Kemper&#x27;s signature program, but it had to be cut with the rest of the junior college. Ridgley tried to rebuild Kemper through the high school, but by 2002, enrollment was down to 124 students and the school could no longer pay its bills. 

On May 31, 2002, 158 years after Frederick T. Kemper taught his first class at the Boonville Boarding School, the flag was lowered for the final time and Kemper Military School was closed.

==School records==
After Kemper closed in 2002, the City of Boonville donated the school&#x27;s records to the State Historical Society of Missouri-Columbia Research Center. Access to student records is restricted due to privacy laws. Former students can request transcript via the center&#x27;s website. 

As of 2012 a small building (named the Library Learning Center) was renovated and used by State Fair Community College for people pursuing an associate&#x27;s degree or a high school equivalency diploma. SFCC remodeled the large northernmost building (named Science Hall) starting in 2015. As of 2019, SFCC-Boonville operations were moved out of the Library building and into Science Hall, using three of the four floors. The Boonslick Regional Library made plans beginning in 2019 to move into the Library Learning Center and transferred ownership of the property from the City in 2023. Expected date of move in is 2024.

== Buildings and grounds==
In 1983, the campus was added to the National Register of Historic places as Historic District A. The district includes 15 contributing buildings.

In 2003, the contents of the school were auctioned, and the school was sold as a parcel. The Kemper facilities were purchased by the City of Boonville and named &quot;Frederick T. Kemper Park&quot;. The park contains and ten buildings on the former Kemper campus. The city has plans to retain ownership of the T.A. Johnston Field House and of of open space. Johnston Field House is home to the Boonslick Heartland YMCA and contains a cardio theater, weight room, aerobics room, indoor pool, indoor batting cage, office space and five basketball courts. The park also contains a regulation football field, soccer fields, a lake and three baseball fields. The city hopes to repair and put into use the five tennis courts. Additional development will be deferred until a master plan is developed after the best use of the space has been determined. The remainder of the core campus is being marketed by Boonville&#x27;s Industrial Development Authority.

In 2005 a group associated with the Utah-based World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools made an offer to buy the campus to open a new school for adolescents needing help with discipline, responsibility and leadership skills. Boonville City Council rejected the proposal.

On April 6, 2010, a tower connected to the old administration building collapsed to the ground, damaging at least one wall of the administration building as well as the roof. The City of Boonville has attempted to salvage as many bricks and ornaments as possible but has no plans to rebuild the tower.

==Movies filmed at Kemper==
At one time, Kemper was asked to be the location to shoot the movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. Kemper turned down the offer. In 1981, the makers of &quot;Taps&quot; made an offer to shoot the movie at Kemper. The president at the time, General Blakefield, declined the request, despite the financial opportunity it presented for Kemper, stating that &quot;it portrayed the military school student as a radical.&quot; In 1986, &quot;Combat Academy&quot; was filmed on campus.

Since the campus has a 19th-century feel, it has been used as the setting for a number of movies. The motion pictures &quot;Combat High&quot; and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; were filmed at the school with cadets and instructors serving as extras. The school depicted in &quot;Child&#x27;s Play 3&quot; was reputedly modeled after Kemper itself.

In September and October 2007, Kemper&#x27;s abandoned campus was used for location shots for the movie &quot;Saving Grace&quot;, which is about a little girl&#x27;s trip back to Boonville in the summer of 1951, during the Great Flood of 1951. Many downtown Boonville buildings were also used for filming, with Kemper the setting for an asylum. The movie, released in 2008, was directed by Connie Stevens and stars Penelope Ann Miller, Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Joel Gretsch, Piper Laurie and Michael Biehn.

Marc-Aurèle-Fortin () is a federal electoral district in Quebec, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 2004.

==Geography==
The district includes the neighbourhoods of Auteuil and Sainte-Rose, the eastern part of the neighbourhood of Fabreville, and the western part of neighbourhood of Vimont in the City of Laval. The neighbouring ridings are Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, Terrebonne—Blainville, Alfred-Pellan, and Vimy.

==History==
The district was created in 2004 from Laval Centre, Terrebonne—Blainville, Laval East and Rivière-des-Milles-Îles ridings. It is named in honour of the artist Marc-Aurèle Fortin.

This riding was significantly changed during the 2012 electoral redistribution. It lost territory to Thérèse-De Blainville and Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, and gained territory from Laval, Laval—Les Îles and Alfred-Pellan making the riding entirely within the city of Laval.

===Members of Parliament===

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<text>The Tacoma Narrows (or the Narrows), a strait, is part of Puget Sound in the U.S. state of Washington. A navigable maritime waterway between glacial landforms, the Narrows separates the Kitsap Peninsula from the city of Tacoma.

The Narrows is spanned by the twin Tacoma Narrows Bridges (State Route 16). An earlier bridge collapsed shortly after it opened.

In 1841 Charles Wilkes, during the United States Exploring Expedition, named the strait simply &quot;Narrows&quot;. Its name was formally set as &quot;The Narrows&quot; by Henry Kellett during the British Admiralty chart reorganization of 1847.

<doc id="678985" wikidata="Q898425" url="?curid=678985" title="Brandywine Creek (Christina River tributary)">
<text>Brandywine Creek (also called the Brandywine River) is a tributary of the Christina River in southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware in the United States. The Lower Brandywine (the main stem) is long and is a designated Pennsylvania Scenic River with several tributary streams. The East Branch and West Branch of the creek originate within 2 miles (3 km) of each other on the slopes of Welsh Mountain in Honey Brook Township, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles (32 km) northwest of their confluence.

The mouth of the creek on the Christina River in present-day Wilmington, Delaware, is the site of the New Sweden colony, where colonists first landed on March 29, 1638. The Battle of Brandywine was fought around the creek near Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on September 11, 1777, during the American Revolution. Water-powered gristmills in Brandywine Village, near the creek mouth, and the nearby DuPont gunpowder mill were important in developing American industry before the introduction of steam power.

==Course==
The headwaters of both the East Branch and West Branch of Brandywine Creek are in western Chester County, Pennsylvania, near Honey Brook. The East Branch and West Branch flow southeast for and , respectively, to their confluence about southeast of Coatesville, between East Bradford Township and Pocopson Township. The combined drainage of the East Branch and West Branch, downstream of the confluence, is defined as Brandywine Creek and continues to flow southeast through Chester County, past Chadds Ford, Delaware County, Pennsylvania then enters the state of Delaware about north of Wilmington.

The creek continues south through First State National Historical Park and Brandywine Creek State Park, into Wilmington, where it flows through Brandywine Park near the city center. Brandywine Creek joins the Christina River east of downtown Wilmington and about upstream from the mouth of the Christina, which also includes flows from the White Clay Creek and Red Clay Creek basins, and finally discharges into the Delaware River estuary. The confluence of the Christina and Delaware rivers is the approximate dividing point between the freshwater Delaware River and the saltwater Delaware Bay.

In Pennsylvania, Chadds Ford, Elam, Downingtown, Unionville, and parts of West Chester, are all in the Brandywine Valley, as well as the Delaware towns of Centreville, Greenville, Montchanin, Hockessin, and Yorklyn. Nearby Avondale (in the White Clay Creek basin) and Kennett Square, Pennsylvania (in the Red Clay Creek basin) are often considered part of the Brandywine Valley.

==History==
Native Americans of the Algonquian-speaking Lenape (or Delaware) Nation lived in the area between the Hudson River Valley and southern Delaware before the European settlement. They lived by hunting, farming corn, beans, and squash, and by fishing. The Brandywine had an especially rich shad fishery. The Lenape called the creek Wauwaset, Wawasiungh, or Wawassan, and other Native American names for it included Suspecough and Trancocopanican.

The first European settlement on the Brandywine was Swedish. On March 29, 1638, Peter Minuit, who had earlier explored the area for the Dutch, founded the colony of New Sweden near the confluence of the Christina and Brandywine, at Fort Christina, in present-day Wilmington. About 600 Swedes, Finns, and Dutch settled in New Sweden. They tended to settle along the Delaware River rather than move inland along the Brandywine and are credited with introducing the log cabin into America. They called the creek Fiskiekylen, or &quot;Fish Creek&quot;, and the Dutch heritage is also reflected in Fiske Creek and variant names using the Dutch word &quot;Kill&quot; or stream, Bainwend Kill, Brandewyn Kill, and Brandywine Kill. The creek&#x27;s current name may be from an old Dutch word for brandy or gin, brandewijn, or from the Swedish word brännvin (Swedish vodka). During the colonisation of the Swedes the creek was called brännvins kilen. It has been asserted that in 1655, a Dutch vessel carrying brandy, wintered in the stream and was sunk due to ice accumulation. The name might also derive from an early mill owner, Andreas Brainwende or Brantwyn. A 1681 map labels the creek &quot;Brande wine Cr.&quot; Thomas Holme&#x27;s 1687 map of Pennsylvania gives the name as simply &quot;Brandy Wine&quot; and shows it flowing into &quot;Christian Creek&quot; and then the &quot;Delaware River&quot;.

The Swedes, Dutch and English disputed possession of the area until 1674, when the English gained control. William Penn was granted a charter for Pennsylvania in 1681 and gained control over the &quot;lower three counties,&quot; as Delaware was then known, soon thereafter. The population of New Sweden had only reached about 1,000, on the western shore of the Delaware, by the time of Penn&#x27;s arrival. By 1687, a Swedish colonist, Tyman Stidham, opened the first mill on the Brandywine, near Wilmington. Holme&#x27;s 1687 map shows only five land claims along the Brandywine, all near present-day Chadds Ford. Land claims of the earlier Swedish and Dutch colonists were not noted on this map.

While the Lenape still remained along the Brandywine, they had by this time been decimated by European diseases and wars with Susquehannock and later Iroquois tribes over control of the fur trade with Europeans. Their estimated population had fallen from 10,000 to 20,000 in 1600 to 2,000 in 1682. The Lenape signed a series of treaties with the Europeans, beginning with a 1682 treaty with William Penn, but were forced out of eastern Pennsylvania by the time of the French and Indian War. During the 1720s and 1730s, the Lenape claimed that William Penn had granted them all the land 1 mile on each side of the creek, and complained that mill dams on the creek were ruining their shad fishery.
Hannah Freeman (1730–1802), believed to be the last Lenape to have lived in Chester County, is buried in Embreeville, near the forks of the creek.

The valley was settled by Quakers, and other dissident Protestants, following Penn&#x27;s Charter. Their activities were mainly farming and milling. Quaker influence is still felt with over 16 Quaker Meetings and several Quaker schools operating in the area.
The Quaker millers near the mouth of the Brandywine cooperated in maintaining quality and branding the flour. &quot;Brandywine Superfine&quot; flour was shipped all along the Atlantic coast and to the West Indies even before the American Revolution.

A base point for surveying the Mason-Dixon line, known as the Stargazers&#x27; Stone, was established in Embreeville west of Philadelphia and north of the Maryland-Pennsylvania border by Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon in 1764. They used the adjoining John Harlan house as their center of operations until 1768.

The creek lends its name to the 1777 Battle of Brandywine of the American Revolutionary War. General William Howe, commanding the British forces, was marching north on Baltimore Pike (now U.S. Route 1) toward Philadelphia and needed to ford the Brandywine near Chadds Ford. General George Washington, massed most of his American forces on the banks of the creek near Chadds Ford, and protected other fords as far as north and south. The Brandywine Battlefield Park covers only , but during the battle British troops marched about north, fording the creek above the forks, to outflank Washington&#x27;s forces.
Before the battle, General Anthony Wayne had his headquarters in Brandywine Village, across the creek from Wilmington, and Continental troops camped nearby, near Lovering Avenue. The poet Bayard Taylor wrote of the battle and the creek:&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em;&quot;&gt;
And once thy peaceful tide
Was filled with life-blood from bold hearts and brave;
and heroes on thy verdant margin died,
The land they loved, to save.

These vales, so calm and still,
Once saw the foeman&#x27;s charge,—the bayonet&#x27;s gleam;
And heard the thunders roll from hill to hill
From morn till sunset&#x27;s beam.&lt;/poem&gt;

Early paper mills were located along the creek, during the Revolution. They supplied Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s print shop and also supplied the paper to print Continental currency and the Declaration of Independence.

The Conestoga wagon was first built to haul grain from the Conestoga Valley to Brandywine flour mills.

A group of painters, including N. C. Wyeth, Andrew Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth and Howard Pyle, are referred to as the &quot;Brandywine School&quot; especially for their landscape works which depict the Brandywine valley. Many of their works are on view at the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford.

===Brandywine Village and early industrialization===
The Brandywine crosses the Fall Line just north of Wilmington. The elevation falls from about above sea level in Chadds Ford, to just a few feet above sea level in Wilmington. The steep descent powered many early industrial activities, including flour milling and the original DuPont gunpowder mills, while the navigable channel to the Delaware River and Delaware Bay allowed manufacturers to load ocean-going ships from near their mills.

By 1687, a Swedish colonist, Tyman Stidham opened the first mill on the Brandywine, near Wilmington. About 1735, Brandywine Village was founded across the creek from Wilmington. Quakers Elizabeth Levis Shipley, her husband William Shipley,
and Thomas Canby were important in establishing the village and its supporting flour mills. By 1743, a dam and a millrace south of the creek had been built.

In 1760, a bridge was built at the current site of the Market Street Bridge, and the north race and two more flour mills were built by Joseph Tatnall.

Oliver Evans in the 1780s helped local mills increase their efficiency, ushering in the Industrial Revolution.

The first paper mill in Delaware, Gilpin&#x27;s mill in north Wilmington, opened in 1787. This site was later used by one of the largest textile mills in the world, Bancroft Mills, which is now closed.

In 1796, the village contained 12 mills that could grind 400,000 bushels of grain per year.

By 1806, there were &quot;about fifty or sixty snug brick, stone, and frame houses&quot; in the village.

In 1795, Jacob Broom built the first cotton mill on the Brandywine, a few miles north of the village, but it burned down two years later.
In 1802, Broom sold the site, complete with a working dam and millrace, to Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, who paid $6,740 for the . Gunpowder mills, known as the Eleutherian Mills, operated on the site from 1802, and by 1810, the site was the largest gunpowder producer in the country. During the Civil War alone, over 4 million barrels of gunpowder were produced here. The mills, which operated until 1921, are now part of the Hagley Museum and Library.

By 1815, several toll roads connected the village with Pennsylvania&#x27;s grain-growing regions, including the Lancaster, Kennett and Concord Pikes. These roads later became Delaware Route 41, Delaware Route 52, and parts of US 202 combined with Delaware Route 202.

The millers cooperated in maintaining quality and branding the flour. &quot;Brandywine Superfine&quot; flour was shipped all along the Atlantic coast and to the West Indies before the American Revolution.

A mill race once used to provide water power is still in working condition in Brandywine Park, designed in the 1890s by Frederick Law Olmsted, near downtown Wilmington.

To the north, Downingtown on the east branch was originally known as Milltown. Its first building, the Downingtown Log House, was built about 1700 where the road between Philadelphia and Lancaster, later known as the Lancaster Pike, crossed the east branch. Thomas Moore built a grist mill in 1716 and Roger Hunt built another in 1739, which operated through at least 1908. Both the Downingtown Log House and the Roger Hunt Mill still stand today.

Milltown was the halfway point on the journey between Philadelphia and Lancaster, so several inns served travelers, including the Ship Inn (c. 1730), the King-in-Armes or Washington Inn (1761), the Half-Way House (1790), and the Swan Hotel (1800).

In the 1880s, Downingtown became known for its paper mills.

Coatesville on the west branch became famous for producing iron goods as early as 1810, and later, rolling steel plate.
Lukens Steel Company has dominated the economy of the town since 1810; today, Cleveland Cliffs continues to make steel there.

===Historic preservation===
These places near the Brandywine are on the National Register of Historic Places.


==Ecology==
Several dams block passage to American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;) spawning runs which cannot access the Pennsylvania reaches of the river. The first of eight dams on Brandywine Creek was removed in 2019, enabling shad to migrate further up the river. The plan to remove all eight dams is known as &quot;Brandywine Shad 2020&quot; and has been led by Professor Jerry Kauffman of the University of Delaware Water Resources Center.

<text>Windermere Real Estate is a real estate company founded in 1972 and based in Seattle, Washington. It is a privately held company and is the largest regional real estate company in the Western U.S., with over 300 offices and 6,500 agents.

== History ==
Windermere Real Estate was founded by John W. Jacobi in 1972, when he purchased an eight-agent office in Seattle, Washington. It grew outside Seattle in 1984 with an office on Bainbridge Island. , Windermere had offices in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Utah, Alaska, Mexico, and Colorado. All Windermere offices are locally owned and operated.

In 1989, the company created the Windermere Foundation to support low-income and homeless children and families throughout its footprint. A portion of every commission on a real estate transaction is donated directly to the Foundation in addition to other fundraisers held at office, regional, or company-wide events, including an annual Community Service Day.

In 2010, Windermere created Windermere Solutions, a web platform for agents. Windermere Solutions rebranded as MoxiWorks in 2014 and began operating independently of Windermere Real Estate. In 2015, Windermere partnered with Porch.com to integrate their data with MoxiWorks.

On March 12, 2013, Windermere announced that it would add drive times to and from work as an attribute of new home buying. According to INRIX, Windermere is the first real estate company to offer this feature. On August 9, 2013 Windermere added Search by Drive Time as a new home buyer feature to its website.

In 2016, Windermere Real Estate entered a three-year agreement to be the &quot;Official Real Estate Company of the Seattle Seahawks&quot;. In November 2016, Windermere launched the &quot;W&quot; Collection, a luxury residential real estate brand for houses priced over $3 million. The &quot;W&quot; Collection was an extension of the company&#x27;s Premier Properties program.

In 2006, D&#x27;Ambrosio &amp; Associates Realtors joined Windermere as a subsidiary. In 2018, Windermere Real Estate acquired a 50 percent stake in West Coast Commercial Realty, a Seattle-based commercial real estate firm.

Geoff P. Wood, the son-in-law of founder John Jacobi, became president of the Windermere Real Estate Company in 1999. He was promoted to CEO in 2003 and became co-president in 2007. Jill Jacobi Wood, daughter of John Jacobi, was appointed President of Windermere Real Estate Company in 2003. In 2009, OB Jacobi, John Jacobi&#x27;s son, was appointed co-president. As of 2007, John Jacobi served as chairman of the board for Windermere Real Estate Company after ceasing participation in day-to-day operations.

In 2017, Windermere appointed its first COO, Brooks Burton. 

== Philanthropy and awards ==
In 1987, Windermere Real Estate sponsored the first Windermere Cup, a crew race in the Montlake Cut of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which became an annual event. In 2002 the company began sponsoring the Cascade Cup.

In 1989, the company established The Windermere Foundation to support low-income and homeless families. The foundation won the Corporate Philanthropy Award in 2018 from the Portland Business Journal.

In 2003, Windermere launched a program called Home For The Holidays, which pays one year&#x27;s rent for seven families in the Puget Sound Region.

In 1999, Windermere Real Estate received the Washington Family Business of the Year Award (Large Business) from the Pacific Lutheran University Family Enterprise Institute.

In 2008, Windermere Real Estate was named the &quot;Top Private Company&quot; by Washington CEO magazine. In 2013, Windermere was awarded the Succession Award from Seattle Business Magazine. In 2015, Inman nominated Windermere for their Most Innovative Real Estate Company award.

<text>Tully&#x27;s Coffee is an American specialty coffee manufacturing brand owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, which acquired &quot;Tully&#x27;s&quot; brand and wholesale business in 2009.

Tully&#x27;s branded coffee continues to be sold by Keurig in its K-Cup format and as bagged ground coffee.
At the time of the Keurig wholesale acquisition, the &quot;Tully&#x27;s&quot; name and retail-store rights were retained by the now-defunct original retailer and wholesaler chain of coffee shops based in Seattle, Washington, which had been originated by Tom &quot;Tully&quot; O&#x27;Keefe in 1992. Its stores served specialty coffees, espresso, baked goods, pastries, and coffee-related supplies. The U.S. chain permanently closed in September 2018.

The coffee-shop chain also has overseas licensing agreements in Japan, which since 2006 have been owned by Ito En, Inc. The brand name is used for over 760 &quot;Tully&#x27;s&quot; coffee houses in Japan (as of April 2022).

&quot;Tully&#x27;s&quot; coffee shops were well known for once following an expansion strategy of opening stores adjacent to those of the considerably larger coffee chain Starbucks, also based in Seattle.

Tully&#x27;s opened its first store in Kent, Washington in September 1992.

The founder of Tully&#x27;s Coffee, Tom &quot;Tully&quot; O&#x27;Keefe, who retired from the company in 2010, planned to rival the quickly expanding Starbucks coffee. Tully&#x27;s quickly developed into a strong regional specialty coffee retailer concentrated in Puget Sound, where coffee loyalty is so deep there is one coffee shop for every 4,000 people. In 2006, Tully&#x27;s made its first net profit. Tully&#x27;s focus was no longer on competing against Starbucks but on serving hand-crafted coffee in its local Seattle area retail coffee shops. The company had franchisees and grocery chain coffee shops in the U.S. and Asia.

It operated stores in the Greater Puget Sound area of Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Idaho, Arizona, California and licensed its brand for use in South Korea and Japan. It had also opened stores in Singapore, Metro Manila, Beijing and Stockholm, Sweden.

Tully&#x27;s opened its first Japanese outlet in Ginza, Tokyo, in 1997. Tully&#x27;s opened in Japan after a 33-year-old Sanwa Bank employee, Kota Matsuda, personally appealed to O&#x27;Keefe to open a chain of high-quality coffee shops in Japan. Matsuda became the CEO of Tully&#x27;s Coffee Japan, a joint venture between Tully&#x27;s, Matsuda and several outside investors. Unlike its rival Starbucks, which chose to run its stores in Japan directly, Tully&#x27;s expanded in Japan through franchising. Tully&#x27;s sold a portfolio of intellectual property to TCJ in August 2005 for over $13 million, and the Japanese tea maker acquired TCJ Ito En in 2006.

In August 2007, plans for an IPO were placed on hold by the company, citing a &quot;volatile market.&quot; This decision was made right after the company was advised by its bankers to refrain from going forward with the IPO due to a tremendously declining stock market. The company pursued alternative sources of capital and sought all strategic investment or sale opportunities as a result. Fiscal 2006 losses amounted to $9.7 million.

===Sale of wholesale coffee-bean distribution business, brand, and roasting operation===
Tully sold its North American wholesale coffee-bean distribution business, brand (which it licensed back for $1/year in perpetuity), and roasting operation to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in 2009, earning $40.3 million in the deal, allowing the company to pay off 100% of its debt, including trade debt, make a cash distribution to shareholders, and maintain substantial cash reserves for the expansion of its retail business. Tully&#x27;s retained all retail rights for North America, and all wholesale and retail rights for the balance of the world, excluding Japan.

In 2010, Tully&#x27;s Coffee International and DK Retail Co., Ltd. entered into a Master Licensing Agreement to develop up to 100 retail stores in South Korea.

Founder and Chairman Tom T. O&#x27;Keefe retired in 2010.

===US coffeeshop closures===
The Tully&#x27;s Coffee board and management filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 2012, citing low cash reserves and the need to renegotiate leases with landlords. At the time of the filing, Tully&#x27;s had recently closed or was about to close 17 unprofitable company-owned stores. Global Baristas, an investment group led by actor Patrick Dempsey had the highest bid of US$9.15 million to buy Tully&#x27;s at a bankruptcy auction on January 3, 2013. U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Karen Overstreet subsequently approved the sale to Global Baristas, rejecting objections from Starbucks and other prospective buyers. The deal became final on June 30, with all employees keeping their jobs and getting a bonus of two vacation days as a &quot;thank you&quot; for their commitment to the company. Dempsey later backed out of the partnership and filed a lawsuit against his former partner and attorney Michael Avenatti.

In September 2017, Tully&#x27;s Coffee announced it would close 12 locations in the Puget Sound region that were located inside Boeing facilities, including the Everett and Renton assembly factories. They had originally opened in 2006 as part of an agreement between the two companies.

On March 8, 2018, Tully&#x27;s announced that it was closing its remaining stores temporarily due to a lack of coffee. Later that month, many Tully&#x27;s locations remained closed with eviction notices posted by landlords indicating the lack of payment.

In April 2018, Tully&#x27;s coffee was sued by Daytona International Speedway.

Tully&#x27;s US coffeehouse business was officially closed when Keurig and Global Baristas entered a permanent injunction in September 2018. Global Baristas agreed to never operate a coffee chain, or any other food or beverage business, under the name again, and Keurig will continue to sell Tully&#x27;s branded coffee.

An involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation petition was filed against Global Baristas in October 2018.

Tully&#x27;s still operates overseas through franchise agreements, with 760 stores in Japan as of April 2022.

<text>A psychic cost is a subset of social costs that specifically represent the costs of added stress or losses to quality of life. In managerial economics and marketing, psychic costs &quot;measure the stress of having to think about a transaction&quot;. In the early 2000s, one of the important psychic costs are the &quot;search costs&quot; of hunting for content that interests us on the Internet. Psychic costs should not be confused for psychic activity, which is when an individual claims to use extra-sensory perception.

==Types==

===Managerial economics===
In managerial economics, economists examine the issue of psychic costs and benefits. An example of a psychic cost is the guilt that a US-restaurant-goer feels if they do not make a voluntary tip to a waiter. There is no requirement for the client to give the tip, but if they do not, they may feel bad when they leave; to avoid this psychic cost, people are inclined to tip, even if the service was sub-standard. On the other hand, a psychic benefit occurs when one of the rewards of an action or choice are non-monetary.

Some jobs pay poorly, such as beach resorts, guitar stores, model train stores, and small colleges, but they always have applicants, because the jobs provide a substantial psychic benefit to the applicants. Seaside resorts such as Club Med pay poorly, but young adults find the prospect of living in a tropical sea resort to be very attractive. Special interest stores such as guitar stores and model railroad stores usually have small margins, and they cannot afford good wages; however, for a guitar enthusiast or a model railroad hobbyist, working in these types of stores is very rewarding, because they are surrounded by other enthusiasts, and they are respected for their knowledge of these areas. Teaching in a small college does not pay well, but new PhD graduates still want to work at these institutions, because it is so pleasant to live in a small town and work in a park-like campus filled with young people and because there is so much competition for tenure-track positions at more prestigious schools.

Stores often introduce strategies to reduce customers&#x27; perceived psychic costs, because these can cause customers to delay or forgo purchases that they are considering. Customers have many areas of perceived psychic costs in regards to making purchases. They may be worried that there will be a sale after they buy the item, in which case they will pay a higher price. For mechanical items such as cars and appliances, customers may be worried about getting a mechanically-faulty &quot;lemon&quot; or a product that does not suit their needs.

For technological items, customers may be concerned that the product may not be compatible with their computer or hardware. To reduce these perceived psychic costs, and encourage customers to make purchases, businesses have developed many strategies, including exchange policies, which allow customers to return the product and exchange it for a similar model within 30 days; return policies, which allow the return of the item with money back; service guarantees, which promise technical support or in-home technician visits; and price guarantees, which promise to refund the difference should their store or a competitor drop the price within a certain period.

During the holiday period, some shoppers find gift-buying very stressful, because they are concerned that gift recipients will not like the gift, either because it is the wrong size, or because it is not suitable; to counter this psychic risk, stores offer &quot;gift receipts&quot; which allow a recipient to return the item and exchange it, and gift cards, which the recipient can use for any item they want. For big-ticket items, such as cars, the purchaser may be worried about all of the upfront costs such as the down payment and registration, along with the new finance payments; dealers have responded with promotions in which the buyer does not have to make the first one or two payments, which gives them &quot;breathing room&quot; and makes them feel more comfortable about buying a costly vehicle. Similar promotions are used by apartment building managers, who offer &quot;first month free&quot; deals for people who sign a one-year lease.

===Minorities and immigrants===
In &quot;The Psychic Cost of Segregation&quot;, a 1954 article by James W. Prothro and Charles U. Smith of Clark Atlanta University, the authors examined the impact of segregation on the personalities of black Americans. An example of the psychic cost is that some white people still feel fear of blacks, which can make it hard for black people to get jobs or apartments in white-dominated neighbourhoods. As well, for business owners with mainly black clientele, some white clients may not come into their restaurant or theater because of perceptions that it may not be safe. In Michael Spence&#x27;s model, black students in a biracial university face psychic costs, such as the stigma of &quot;acting white&quot; to convince the admissions committee that they will be a good student, or the threat of stereotyping. Research on discrimination against employees has indicated that in businesses with white employees and black employees, the white employees may get better tips.

Research on illegal immigration indicates that illegal immigrants face psychic costs from the whole ordeal of being smuggled across a border, using false papers, lying to border officials, hiding from border patrols, and avoiding detection once they are living in their new country.

===Other types===
&quot;Slate&quot; writer Steven Landsburg argues that &quot;psychic costs shouldn&#x27;t count because they&#x27;re too easy to exaggerate. Anyone can claim to have suffered $1 million worth of emotional distress, but we have no way of knowing which claims are simply fabricated.&quot; As well, he claims that a second problem with &quot;... counting psychic harm is that once you start counting it, people train themselves to start feeling it&quot;. In Mark A. Runco and Ruth Richards&#x27; book &quot;Eminent Creativity, Everyday Creativity, and Health&quot;, they argue that creative people face psychic costs when they are thinking up new ideas, because the mental process drains them emotionally, and because there is a social stigma associated with being different, and being an artist. In the article &quot;Putting a Price Tag on Friends, Relatives, and Neighbours&quot;, N Powdthavee argues that there are substantial psychic costs associated with being unemployed or separated from a marriage partner by divorce, because these situations reduce the social ties that keep us emotionally healthy.

Psychologist and former U.S. Army officer David Allen Grossman argues that only a small fraction of soldiers kill during warfare, because the soldiers have an innate resistance to killing a fellow human being. He claims that soldiers during World War II resisted by purposely firing above their target or not firing their rifles. When the military realized that soldiers faced such high psychic costs from killing people, they began developing strategies to encourage more soldiers to kill their targets. Nevertheless, after the Vietnam War, one of the impacts of killing enemy soldiers was that US soldiers faced post-traumatic stress syndrome. Brigadier General S.L.A. Marshall concluded in his book, &quot;Men Against Fire&quot;, (1946, 1978), that &quot;only 15 to 20 percent of the individual riflemen in World War II fired their weapons at an exposed enemy soldier&quot;. Over the centuries, armies have developed a range of &quot;tactical and mechanical mechanisms to enable or force combatants to overcome their resistance to killing&quot;.

Research on tax evasion shows that tax cheaters may face psychic costs from their deception, because they feel guilty about not paying their fair share for the services that they use. These psychic costs may also be from fear of shame if they are prosecuted for tax evasion and damage to their reputation; with these psychic costs, taxpayers may even pass up fairly low-risk opportunities to hide income from the taxman.

David Hemenway of Harvard School of Public Health claims that when some people in a community own guns, it &quot;imposes psychic costs on most other members of the community&quot;. He claims that &quot;eighty-five percent of non-gun-owners report they would feel less safe if more people in their community acquired guns; only 8% would feel more safe&quot;. This is purportedly because non gun-owners would worry about guns being used in the neighbourhood.

As the monetary costs of information and digital information fall (e.g., downloadable music recordings, magazine articles, etc.) towards zero, the main impediments to a transaction are becoming non-monetary factors such as search costs and psychic costs. Search costs are the time and effort costs of finding something. If a person has to search through a poorly-catalogued list of songs on the Internet, it may take hours to find the song that they want. Even if the song is free to download, they have to spend a lot of free time to find that song. Obtaining this &quot;free&quot; downloadable song may impose other psychic costs that make a person worry. The song file may have to be reformatted to work with one&#x27;s media player and it may have to be screened for viruses or spyware.

<doc id="679040" wikidata="Q2575316" url="?curid=679040" title="Soul Plane">
<text>Soul Plane is a 2004 American comedy film directed by Jessy Terrero (in his feature film directorial debut). The film stars Tom Arnold, Kevin Hart, Method Man and Snoop Dogg. Supporting actors include Mo&#x27;Nique, Loni Love, K. D. Aubert, D. L. Hughley, Godfrey and Sofia Vergara. The film revolves around multiple characters in different scenarios on board an airplane. &quot;Soul Plane&quot; received negative reviews from critics and grossed $14 million worldwide, falling short of its $16 million budget.

==Plot==
Nashawn Wade claims that he has loved planes since he was a child, but he has a horrible experience with a typical airline: his dog Dre is classified as a checked baggage instead of a carry-on, he eats a horrible airline meal, his buttocks get stuck in the toilet while he has diarrhea, caused by his meal, during turbulence, and Dre is fatally sucked through a jet engine after a flight attendant accidentally opens the cargo door.

In response to the terrible experience he endured, Nashawn sues the airline and is awarded $100,000,000 by the jury. He decides to use the money to start his own airline, called N.W.A. (Nashawn Wade Airlines), whose acronym and logo are a pop culture reference to rap group N.W.A. The airline specifically caters to African Americans and hip hop culture. The terminal at the airport is called the Malcolm X terminal, where two non-working TSA Agents, Jamiqua and Shaniece, are goofing off instead of checking belongings. The plane is a heavily modified Boeing 747SP, customized with low-rider hydraulics, spinners, and a dance club. The safety video is also a parody of the Destiny&#x27;s Child song &quot;Survivor&quot;.

After taking off from Los Angeles International Airport, Nashawn must deal with a multitude of problems, starting with his acrophobic captain, Captain Mack. At a cruising altitude of Flight Level 330, it is revealed that he has never left the ground because he learned to fly on computer simulators in prison. Meanwhile, his cousin Muggsey sets up a miniature casino and strip joint in one of the areas of the plane (as seen in the workprint and unrated versions of the film), and Nashawn&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Giselle is on board and less than happy to see him. Meanwhile, the Hunkee family, the only Caucasian passengers on board, must also deal with their own problems; Elvis&#x27; daughter Heather is turning 18 and plans to use her newfound freedom by drinking and having sex, his son has transformed from an exact duplicate of him to a stereotypical wigger, and his wife is suddenly addicted to black men after viewing pictures in a pornographic magazine.

Captain Mack seemingly dies after eating mushrooms that the co-pilot, First Officer Gaemon, uses to soothe his genital crabs. Nashawn attempts to contact Gaemon, who is incapacitated after slipping near a hot tub, forcing Nashawn to attempt to land the plane himself. Nashawn lands the plane safely, using flight attendant Blanca&#x27;s flight knowledge which she learned while having sex in the cockpit with the pilot on another plane. The plane lands in the middle of Central Park instead of John F. Kennedy International Airport, and the spinners are stolen from the plane. Nashawn reconciles with Giselle after earlier revealing to her that he only broke up with her so she would not give up her college opportunities for him.

The movie ends with Nashawn telling the audience the fate of his crew. He claims that he and his ex-girlfriend are back together and are taking their relationship slow this time around, his cousin Muggsey has started a strip club and gambling casino located in another airplane similar to the club in Nashawn&#x27;s plane, Elvis has begun a sexual relationship with Jamiqua, and his son Billy has become a major music video director but has disappeared shortly after filming a Michael Jackson video. Captain Mack later wakes up to find his chain and clothing stolen.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Soul Plane&quot; opened on May 28, 2004, in 1,566 theaters. In its opening weekend, the film made $5,648,486 in the domestic box office, ranking number five behind &quot;Shrek 2&quot;, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Troy&quot;, and &quot;Raising Helen&quot;. At the end of its run, the film grossed $14,190,750 domestically and $631,596 overseas for a worldwide total of $14,822,346.

In an interview on the podcast &quot;WTF with Marc Maron&quot;, Hart said that the poor box office turnout was partly due to bootlegging, which had apparently begun three months before the film was released in theaters. He explained, &quot;on the street, &quot;Soul Plane&quot; made 40 million dollars&quot;. Hart told Marc Maron that during a premiere, fans were coming up to him asking him to sign copies of the bootleg. Hart does, however, credit &quot;Soul Plane&quot; for making him popular enough to start touring around the country.

===Critical reception===
Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 18% of 101 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 3.8/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus called it: &quot;A raunchy sendup of &quot;Airplane!&quot; that never really takes off.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; says in his review: &quot;This hectic farce, which pushes every envelope, is so broad and relentlessly raunchy that it makes a spoof like &quot;Airplane&quot; seem as demure as a vintage drawing-room comedy.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Nathan Rabin criticized the film for having stereotypical characters and humor made up of &quot;desperate half-gags further botched by clumsy camera work and atrocious timing.&quot; Scott Brown of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film a &quot;C−&quot; grade, noting the similarities to &quot;Airplane&quot; saying, &quot;The makers of &quot;Soul Plane&quot; figured they&#x27;d simply reverse the racial polarity and pack a whole movie full of similar material — just not as funny.&quot; He concluded that, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for comic insights beyond the well-documented ass differential between whites and blacks, well, golly, you ought to try another carrier.&quot; Wesley Morris of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; gave the film credit for delivering a couple funny gags but was offset by &quot;embarrassing bathroom jokes and witless raunch&quot;. Despite giving credit to Hart, Hughley and Snoop for their performances, Marc Savlov of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; felt that the rest of the film&#x27;s sophomoric gags &quot;only serves to make the rest of the production that much more humorless in contrast.&quot;

In late 2014, the film appeared on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s users-voted list of &quot;The 50 Worst Movies Ever&quot;, ranking number 47. Its given reason for being listed states: &quot;This was billed as an &#x27;urban&#x27; take on &quot;Airplane!&quot; That&#x27;s a bad idea to begin with: like &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, parodies of a parody are on to a loser from the start. But with the addition of crude racial stereotyping (of all races) and a fatal lack of funny, this goes from bad to worst. If more voters had seen it, this would be in the top ten.&quot;

<doc id="679041" wikidata="Q766329" url="?curid=679041" title="Seattle's Best Coffee">
<text>Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee LLC is a subsidiary of Nestlé whose brand is used to sell wholesale coffee, ground coffee, and coffee K-cups. While this brand used to have coffeehouses in the United States, it no longer advertises them on its website. Some of these coffeehouses have converted to Starbucks while Starbucks previously owned this brand. Focus Brands owns the franchising rights for this brand&#x27;s coffeehouses for international markets and military bases.

Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee is generally less expensive than Starbucks, its former parent, and is marketed as more of a working class coffee compared to the upmarket Starbucks.

==History==
Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee began as a combination ice cream and coffee shop called the Wet Whisker in Coupeville on Whidbey Island, northwest of Seattle, in 1969. Founder Jim Stewart purchased green coffee beans from local roasters to be roasted and sold at the Wet Whisker. By the end of the second summer, the shop had roasted and sold nearly 500 lbs (226 kg) of coffee. By the end of the following year, the Vashon Island Wet Whisker was sold, and Jim Stewart, along with his brother Dave, opened another ice cream and coffee store on Pier 70 on Seattle&#x27;s Waterfront. The shop was called Stewart Brothers Wet Whisker. In 1982, it began serving espresso based beverages alongside other coffee products.

In 1983, the name again changed from Stewart Brothers Wet Whisker to Stewart Brothers Coffee. Shortly after, business began to expand, and new shops opened in Bellevue, Washington, and at Seattle&#x27;s historic Pike Place Market a year later. In 1991, the company was renamed &quot;Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee&quot; after winning a local competition.

Around 1995, the company was purchased by a group of investors who own Torrefazione Italia. They formed a new company made up of both parties called Seattle Coffee Holdings. In 1997, Seattle Coffee Holdings changed its name to Seattle Coffee Company. In 1998, AFC Enterprises purchased Seattle Coffee Holdings and began franchising the Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee brand. During AFC Enterprises&#x27; ownership, Seattle Coffee Company&#x27;s Vashon Island roasterie was upgraded and the company&#x27;s organic coffee line was established. AFC Enterprises sold SBC to Starbucks in July 2003, retaining franchise rights in eleven countries, Hawaii and U.S. military bases.

Starbucks closed the Vashon Island facility on October 23, 2003, and moved production to their Kent, Washington, roasterie. SBC had previously stored beans at the Port of Seattle and transported them to Vashon for roasting, which was deemed insufficient for the company&#x27;s needs. The historic Vashon Island roasterie building which includes Jim Stewart&#x27;s original 1952 roaster, while no longer affiliated with SBC or Starbucks, was bought and reopened as &quot;The Vashon Island Coffee Roasterie&quot; when the owner of The Minglement, an organic foods, herbs, and spices store, decided to move her store to a larger store. This store continues to employ Peter Larsen, the coffee roast master who worked at this store when it was previously part of Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee.

On October 18, 2022, Starbucks sold Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee to Nestlé.

==Distribution partners==
The Borders bookstore chain signed a contract with Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee in 2004 to convert Borders&#x27; in-store cafes to Seattle&#x27;s Best cafes. By 2006, approximately two-thirds of Borders&#x27; domestic superstores had completed the Seattle&#x27;s Best conversion. Seattle&#x27;s Best parent company Starbucks Corporation has contracted with Borders&#x27; competitor Barnes &amp; Noble to sell its products in Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s Cafes. (Borders has since completely shut down due to bankruptcy.) Starbucks also owns and operates locations within Chapters and Indigo Books and Music bookstores in Canada.

Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee Cafes are found in larger JCPenney department stores when the company signed a contract in the late 1990s to have in-store cafés in department stores.

Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee Cafes and Kiosks can also be found on all 21 ships in the fleet of the cruise line Royal Caribbean International under the name &quot;Latte-Tudes&quot; or &quot;Cafe Promenade&quot;. The presence of the Seattle&#x27;s Best outlets on Royal Caribbean is also tied in with all other free-of-charge coffee items on the ship also being exclusively supplied by SBC. The Oasis class ships also have Starbucks outlet with the regular land price list, SBC is for-free (included in cruise cost)

On February 16, 2010, Burger King announced that they would add Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee to their menu in over 7,000 restaurants.

On May 12, 2010, Starbucks announced a rebranding of Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee, with a new logo and plans to expand Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee distribution from 3,000 locations to 30,000 by the end of the 2010 fiscal year. The rebranding of the Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee logo from the detailed, vintage logo to the clinical, generic design for the new mass market was met with much criticism, with the new logo being likened to a label for eye-drops, a blood-bank sign and a gas station logo.

On February 8, 2011, Delta Air Lines and Seattle&#x27;s Best entered into an agreement to offer Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee onboard all domestic, international, and Delta Connection flights beginning March 1, 2011. Since February 2015; however, Delta adjusted its coffee offerings in favor of Seattle&#x27;s Best&#x27;s then-parent company Starbucks on all flights.

The Swedish fast food chain Max Hamburgers ended its partnership with Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee and discontinued serving their coffee on November 13, 2019.

<doc id="679052" wikidata="Q7994564" url="?curid=679052" title="White Clay Creek">
<text>White Clay Creek is an tributary of the Christina River in southern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware in the United States. It is renowned for its scenic character and is largely federally protected.

The White Clay Creek watershed is home to nearly 100,000 people and includes parts of Chester County, Pennsylvania and New Castle County, Delaware. The Pennsylvania portion still retains a rural character while the Delaware portion is more suburbanized. Sediment eroded from the rolling hills of Chester County is carried into the White Clay, probably accounting for the creek&#x27;s name.

The majority of the stream is in the Piedmont region which is characterized by rolling hills, plateaus, and stream valleys. The southern portion of the stream, near Newark is in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, a relatively flat area that is dotted with large tidal wetlands. The White Clay Creek empties into the Christina River at Churchman&#x27;s Marsh.

==East Branch==
The East Branch, long, arises near the hamlet of Upland in West Marlborough Township. Flowing southward, it passes through Avondale, where it is joined by Trout Run. From Avondale, the former Pomeroy and Newark Railroad, abandoned in 1939, follows the creek southward. Further south, after the confluence of Egypt Run, the creek begins to turn and meander in a narrow gorge, passing through Landenberg, formerly a mill town and the junction of the Pomeroy &amp; Newark with the Wilmington and Western Railroad. Exiting the gorge into a broader valley, the creek receives Broad Run shortly after entering the White Clay Creek Preserve. It joins the main body of the White Clay Creek in the Preserve, at the lost community of Yeatman.

==Middle Branch==
The Middle Branch, long, originates in Londonderry Township. Flowing southward along the western edge of West Grove, it turns east, south again, and then east again to meet Indian Run. Turning south, it cuts sharply through the hills near Chesterville and meets the West Branch to form the main stem.

==West Branch==
The West Branch, long, rises near Kelton and flows south and east through New London Township, gradually turning to the east where it meets the Middle Branch to form the main stem.

==Main stem==
The main stem of White Clay Creek is formed by the junction of the West and Middle branches. From here, it enters a narrow valley and then the White Clay Creek Preserve, meeting the East Branch at Yeatman. It flows south through the White Clay Creek Preserve and enters New Castle County, Delaware and White Clay Creek State Park approximately west of Wilmington. Trails parallel the creek, some of them using parts of the Pomeroy &amp; Newark roadbed, which follows the creek to the outskirts of Newark. The creek then turns away to the east, receiving Middle Run and Pike Creek. As it approaches the Christina estuary, the valley opens up, and it passes Delaware Park. Mill Creek flows into it, shortly followed by its largest tributary, Red Clay Creek. The conjoined streams turn southwest and then back to the east as they loop around Bread and Cheese Island, formed between the Red Clay, White Clay, and Hershey Run by a backchannel now filled. Just after passing the island, White Clay Creek enters the Christina approximately southwest of Wilmington at Churchman&#x27;s Marsh.

==History and ecology==
The river&#x27;s historical sites include lime kilns and 19th-century mills. Its lower course includes the most extensive Piedmont forests remaining in Delaware that are home to several key species, including the federally listed endangered bog turtle. In 2000, the United States Congress designated of White Clay Creek and its tributaries as part of the National Wild and Scenic River program.

<text>Robert Todd Duncan (February 12, 1903 – February 28, 1998) was an American baritone opera singer and actor. One of the first African-Americans to sing with a major opera company, Duncan is also noted for appearing as Porgy in the premier production of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; (1935).

==Early life==
Duncan was born February 12, 1903, in Danville, Kentucky, to John and Lettie (Cooper) Duncan. They were married in Danville 1901, he being born in Danville, and she born in Frankfort. John was a garage owner and Lettie was a music teacher. He obtained his musical training at Butler University in Indianapolis with a B.A. in music followed by an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College.

==Career==

In 1934, Duncan debuted in Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; at the Mecca Temple in New York with the Aeolian Opera, a black opera company.

Duncan was George Gershwin&#x27;s personal choice as the first performer of the role of Porgy in &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; in 1935 and played the role more than 1,800 times. He led the cast during the Washington run of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; at the National Theatre in 1936, to protest the theatre&#x27;s policy of segregation. Duncan stated that he &quot;would never play in a theater which barred him from purchasing tickets to certain seats because of his race.&quot; Eventually management would give into the demands and allow for the first integrated performance at National Theatre. Duncan was also the first performer for the role of Stephen Kumalo in Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; which opened on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre on October 30, 1949, and closed on July 1, 1950, after 281 performances.

In 1938, Duncan appeared on the London stage at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in C.B.Cochran&#x27;s musical production &quot;The Sun Never Sets&quot;. The cast included fellow American Adelaide Hall, Leslie Banks, Edna Best and Stewart Granger. The musical was adapted by Pat Wallace and Guy Bolton from various stories written by Edgar Wallace and the show included original music by Cole Porter. Costumes were designed by Elizabeth Haffenden. One of the numbers Duncan sang was &#x27;River God&#x27;. After the London run closed, Duncan and Adelaide Hall from the original cast toured Britain with the production.
Duncan taught voice at Howard University in Washington, D.C. from 1930 until 1945. While teaching at Howard, he continued touring as a soloist with pianists William Duncan Allen and George Malloy. He had a very successful career as a concert singer with over 2,000 performances in 56 countries and two film roles. He retired from Howard and opened his own voice studio teaching privately and giving periodic recitals.

In 1945, he became the first African American to sing with a major opera company, and the first black person to sing in an opera with an otherwise white cast, when he performed the role of Tonio in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; with the New York City Opera. In the same year he sang the role of Escamillo, the bullfighter, in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; and performed the song cycle Songs of Glory composed by Dutch-American director Dirk Foch on texts by Joseph Auslander, then Poet Laureate. In 1954, Duncan was the first to record &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, a popular song with music by Alex North and lyrics by Hy Zaret. The recording was made for the soundtrack of the obscure prison film &quot;Unchained&quot;, in which Duncan also played a minor character. Following Duncan&#x27;s version, the song went on to become one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century.

In his final interview, Todd Duncan spoke of his love for spirituals: &quot;... spirituals are so deep inside of me, it&#x27;s difficult for me to find words that are meaningful. Spirituals are a part of whatever I am. When I sing them my being sings them, not my throat... It is very difficult for me to put into words something that is at the bottom of my very being.&quot;

In addition to singing, Duncan was also a voice teacher. Among his notable pupils was operatic bass Philip Booth who was a mainstay at the Metropolitan Opera for two decades.

==Honors and death==
In 1978, the Washington Performing Arts Society presented his 75th birthday gala. Duncan was awarded the George Peabody Medal of Music from the Peabody Conservatory of Music of Johns Hopkins University in 1984. Other awards he received include a medal of honor from Haiti, an NAACP award, the Donaldson Award, the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Award for &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot;, and honorary doctorates from Valparaiso University and Butler University.

Duncan was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.

He died of a heart ailment at his home in Washington, D.C., February 28, 1998, survived by his wife, Gladys Jackson Duncan, and adopted son, Charles, a successful attorney.

<doc id="679074" wikidata="Q1248690" url="?curid=679074" title="Quatermass and the Pit">
<text>Quatermass and the Pit is a British television science-fiction serial transmitted live by BBC Television in December 1958 and January 1959. It was the third and last of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, although the chief character, Professor Bernard Quatermass, reappeared in a 1979 ITV production called &quot;Quatermass&quot;. Like its predecessors, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was written by Nigel Kneale.

The serial continues the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating a site in Knightsbridge, London, discover a strange skull and what at first appears to be an unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malignant influence over many of those who come in contact with it, including Quatermass. He concludes that millions of years in the past the aliens, probably from Mars, had abducted pre-humans and modified them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, leaving a genetic legacy which is responsible for much of the war and racial strife in the world.

The serial has been cited as having influenced Stephen King and the film director John Carpenter. It featured in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute, which described it as &quot;completely gripping&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1953) and &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955), both written by Nigel Kneale, had been critical and popular successes for the BBC, and in early 1957 the corporation decided to commission a third serial. Kneale had left the BBC shortly before, but was hired to write the new scripts on a freelance basis.

The British Empire had been in decline since the 1920s, and the pace accelerated in the wake of the Second World War. During the 1950s immigration into Britain from the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean was on the increase, causing resentment among parts of British society. At the time Kneale was working on his scripts, black communities in Nottingham and London came under attack from mobs of white Britons. Whilst Kneale disdained most science-fiction works of the 1950s as escapist, he preferred to base his plots on current events. Thus Kneale developed the serial as an allegory for the emerging racial tensions illustrated by the Notting Hill race riots of August and September 1958.

Kneale was also inspired by the rebuilding of London in the 1950s. Huge pits were dug in the process of erecting new structures, and the digs found unexploded ordnance from the Blitz and the occasional Romano-British ruin. Kneale thought: &quot;What if they uncovered a spaceship?&quot;

==Plot==
Workmen discover a pre-human skull while building in the fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob&#x27;s Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a palaeontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, something that looks like a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney&#x27;s group is halted because the military believe it to be an unexploded WWII bomb.

Roney calls in his friend Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Rocket Group to prevent the military from disturbing what he believes to be an archaeological find. Quatermass and Colonel Breen become intrigued by the site. Breen has recently been appointed, despite Quatermass&#x27;s objections, to be nominally his deputy but in reality to lead the Rocket Group. As more of the artefact is uncovered additional fossils are found, which Roney dates to five million years ago, suggesting that the object is at least that old. The interior is empty, and a symbol of six intersecting circles, which Roney identifies as a pentacle, is etched on a wall that appears to conceal an inner chamber.

The inner chamber wall of the object is so hard that even a borazon boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, vibrations cause severe distress to people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers reports of ghosts and poltergeists have been common in the area for decades. An hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artifact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.

Following the drilling attempt, a hole opens up in the object&#x27;s interior wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens may have come from a planet habitable five million years ago - Mars.

While clearing his equipment from the craft, the drill operator triggers more poltergeist activity, and runs through the streets in a panic until he finds sanctuary in a church. Quatermass and Roney find him there, and he describes visions of the insect aliens killing each other. As Quatermass investigates the history of the area, he finds accounts dating back to mediaeval times about devils and ghosts, all centred on incidents where the ground was disturbed. He suspects a psychic projection of these beings has remained on the alien ship and is being seen by those who come into contact with it.

Quatermass decides to use Roney&#x27;s optic-encephalogram, a device that records impressions from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney&#x27;s assistant, Barbara Judd, is the most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge of the Martian hive to root out unwanted mutations.

Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artifact is one of the ships that had crashed at the end of its journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity&#x27;s ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth; however, the aliens had become extinct before completing their work. As the human race evolved, a percentage retained their psychic abilities which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory.

The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara&#x27;s vision. They instead suggest that the craft is a buried remnant from the London Blitz: a Nazi propaganda weapon, with the alien bodies fakes designed to create a panic. They decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.

Quatermass warns that if implanted psychic powers survive in the human race, there could also still be an ingrained compulsion to enact the &quot;Wild Hunt&quot; of a race purge, but the media event goes ahead regardless. The power cables that string into the craft fully activate it for the first time, and glowing and humming like a living thing it starts to draw upon this energy source and awaken the ancient racial programming. Those Londoners in whom the alien admixture remains strong fall under the ship&#x27;s influence; they merge into a group mind and begin a telekinetic mass murder of those without the alien genes, an ethnic cleansing of those the alien race mind considers to be impure and weak.

Breen stands transfixed and is eventually consumed by the energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and an image of a Martian &quot;devil&quot; floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt. Quatermass himself succumbs to Martian influence and attempts to kill Roney, who lacks the alien gene and is immune to alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the &quot;devil&quot; but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages to walk up to the apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.

At the conclusion of the final episode Quatermass gives a television broadcast, at the end of which he delivers a warning directly to camera: &quot;Every war crisis, witch hunt, race riot, and purge... is a reminder and a warning. We are the Martians. If we cannot control the [Martian] inheritance within us, this will be their second dead planet&quot;.

==Cast==
For the third time in as many serials the title role was played by a different actor, this time by André Morell; the part had initially been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as O&#x27;Brien in their BBC television adaptation of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell&#x27;s portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.

Colonel Breen was played by Anthony Bushell, who was known for various similar military roles – including another bomb disposal officer in &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1949) – and preferred to be addressed as &quot;Major Bushell&quot;, the rank he held during the Second World War. Roney was played by Canadian actor Cec Linder, John Stratton played Captain Potter, and Christine Finn played the other main character, Barbara Judd. Finn went on to provide the voices for various characters in the popular 1960s children&#x27;s television series &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;.

For the first time, Kneale used a character from a previous serial other than Quatermass himself, the journalist James Fullalove from &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. The production team had hoped that Paul Whitsun-Jones would be able to reprise the part; he was unavailable and Brian Worth was cast instead. Michael Ripper appeared as an army sergeant; he had been in Hammer Film Productions&#x27; adaptation of the second &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;, the previous year.

==Episodes==
==Production==
===Filming===
The director assigned was Rudolph Cartier, with whom Kneale had a good working relationship; the two had collaborated on the previous &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, as well as the literary adaptations &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1953) and &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1954). The budget of £17,500 allocated for &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was larger than that of the previous &quot;Quatermass&quot; productions. Pre-production began in September 1958, while Cartier was still working on &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; for the BBC. As the two previous &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials had been scheduled in half-hour slots but, performed live, had overrun, Cartier requested 35-minute slots for the six episodes of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. This was agreed in November 1958, just before the start of production on 24 November. The six episodes – &quot;The Halfmen&quot;, &quot;The Ghosts&quot;, &quot;Imps and Demons&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted&quot;, &quot;The Wild Hunt&quot; and &quot;Hob&quot; – were broadcast on Monday nights at 8 pm from 22 December 1958 to 26 January 1959.

Each episode was predominantly live from Studio 1 of the BBC&#x27;s Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London. The episodes were rehearsed from Tuesday to Saturday, usually at the Mary Wood Settlement in Tavistock Place, London, with camera rehearsals in the morning and afternoon of transmission. Not every scene was live; a significant amount of material was on 35 mm film and inserted during the performance. Most filming involved scenes set on location or those too technically complex or expansive to achieve live. The latter were shot at Ealing Studios, acquired by the BBC in 1955, when Cartier worked with the cinematographer A. A. Englander. Pre-filming was also used to show the passage of time in the second episode; the archaeological dig at Ealing was shown to have dug deeper into the ground than the equivalent set at Riverside, enabling a sense of time having elapsed that would not have been possible in an all-live production.

Special effects were handled by the BBC Visual Effects Department, formed by Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine in 1954. Kine or Wilkie oversaw effects on a production; due to the number of effects, both worked on &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. The team pre-filmed most of their effects for use during the live broadcasts. They also oversaw practical effects for the Ealing filming and Riverside transmission, and constructed the bodies of the Martian creatures.

Made just before videotape came into general use at the BBC, all six episodes of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; were preserved for a possible repeat by being telerecorded on 35 mm film. This was achieved with a specially synchronised film camera capturing the output of a video monitor; the process had been refined throughout the 1950s and recordings of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. The serial was repeated in edited form as two 90-minute episodes, entitled &quot;5 Million Years Old&quot; and &quot;Hob&quot;, on 26 December 1959 and 2 January 1960. Unlike many programmes of its era that were lost broadcasts, all six episodes survived. The third episode, &quot;Imps and Demons&quot;, was re-shown on BBC Two on 7 November 1986 as part of the &quot;TV50&quot; season, celebrating 50 years of BBC television.

&quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was the last original production on which Kneale collaborated with Rudolph Cartier.

===Music===
The music was credited to Trevor Duncan, a pseudonym used by BBC radio producer Leonard Trebilco, whose music was obtained from stock discs. &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; also used electronic sound effects and electronic music to create a disturbing atmosphere. These tracks were created for the serial by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, overseen by Desmond Briscoe; &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was one of the productions for which Briscoe and the workshop became most renowned. It was the first time electronic music had been used in a science-fiction television production.

==Reception==
&quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was watched by an average audience of 9.6 million viewers, peaking at 11 million for the final episode. &quot;The Times&quot;″ television reviewer praised the opening episode the day after its transmission. Pointing out that &quot;Professor Bernard Quatermass ... like all science fiction heroes, has to keep running hard if he is not to be overtaken by the world of fact&quot;, the anonymous reviewer went on to state how much he had enjoyed the episode as &quot;an excellent example of Mr. Kneale&#x27;s ability to hold an audience with promises alone; smooth, leisurely, and without any sensational incident&quot;.

Kneale went on to use the Martian &quot;Wild Hunt&quot; as an allegory for the recent Notting Hill race riots, but some Black British leaders were upset by the depiction of racial tensions in the first episode, according to &quot;The Times&quot;″ Birmingham correspondent: &quot;Leaders of coloured minorities here to-day criticized the BBC for allowing a report that &#x27;race riots are continuing in Birmingham&#x27;, to be included in a fictional news bulletin during the first instalment of the new Quatermass television play last night&quot;.

These themes and subtexts were highlighted by the British Film Institute&#x27;s review of the serial when it was included in their TV 100 list in 2000, in 75th position – 20th out of the dramas featured: &quot;In a story which mined mythology and folklore ... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man&#x27;s hostile nature and the military&#x27;s perversion of science for its own ends&quot;.

==Influence==
In a 2006 &quot;Guardian&quot; article Mark Gatiss wrote: &quot;What sci-fi piece of the past 50 years doesn&#x27;t owe Kneale a huge debt? ... The &#x27;ancient invasion&#x27; of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; cast a huge shadow ... its brilliant blending of superstition, witchcraft and ghosts into the story of a five-million-year-old Martian invasion is copper-bottomed genius&quot;. Gatiss was a scriptwriter for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, a programme that had been particularly strongly influenced by the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials throughout its history. Derrick Sherwin, the producer of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 1969, acknowledged &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;″s influence on the programme&#x27;s move towards more realism and away from &quot;wobbly jellies in outer space&quot;. The 1971 and 1977 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials &quot;The Dæmons&quot; and &quot;Image of the Fendahl&quot; share many elements with &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;: the unearthing of an extraterrestrial spaceship, an alien race that has interfered with human evolution and is the basis for legends of devils, demons and witchcraft, and an alien influence over human evolution.

Writer and critic Kim Newman cited &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; as perfecting &quot;the notion of the science-fictional detective story&quot;. Newman said the programme was an influence on horror fiction writer Stephen King, saying that King had &quot;more or less rewritten &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;&quot;. Newman also wrote that both the 1976 novel &quot;The Space Vampires&quot; and its 1985 film adaptation &quot;Lifeforce&quot; were closely inspired by &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;; they feature a malicious alien influence on humanity, are set largely in London, and the problem is resolved using cold iron.

After &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; Kneale felt that it was time to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial in 1972. The BBC did not proceed with the project, and Kneale&#x27;s scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled &quot;Quatermass&quot;.

==Other media==
As with the previous two Quatermass serials, the rights to adapt &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; for the cinema were purchased by Hammer Film Productions. Their adaptation was released as the 1967 film &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, directed by Roy Ward Baker and scripted by Kneale. Scottish actor Andrew Keir starred as Quatermass, the role for which he was best remembered and regarded particularly highly in comparison to the previous film Quatermass, Brian Donlevy. The film, made in colour, is regarded by many commentators as a classic of the genre for the way it blends science fiction with the supernatural. In the United States the film was retitled &quot;Five Million Years to Earth&quot;.

A script book of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was released by Penguin Books in April 1960, with a cover by Kneale&#x27;s artist brother Bryan Kneale. In 1979 this was re-published by Arrow Books to coincide with the transmission of the fourth and final Quatermass serial on ITV; this edition featured a new introduction by Kneale. The theatrical company Creation Productions staged a live adaptation of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in a quarry near Nottingham in August 1997.

The BBC made &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; available to buy on VHS videotape in 1989 in a two-part format. It was edited from a 207 minute total runtime down to 178 minutes, largely by trimming comic relief segments. A full, unedited, episodic version of the serial was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2005, as part of &quot;The Quatermass Collection&quot; box set. Also included were the surviving two episodes of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, all of &quot;Quatermass II&quot; and various extra features.

For the box set release, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was extensively restored using film from the BBC archives. A process called VidFIRE was applied to the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. This was used to digitally remaster scenes for the DVD release.

A Blu-ray edition was released in 2018 to mark the show&#x27;s 60th anniversary. For this edition, some material trimmed from the DVD box set version for technical reasons was reinstated, and a set of audio commentaries prepared by Toby Hadoke, based on his interviews and archival audio recordings by various members of the cast and crew.

==Parodies==
A 1959 episode of the BBC radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; parodied &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;. The episode &quot;The Scarlet Capsule&quot; was written by Spike Milligan, and used the original BBC Radiophonic Workshop sound effects made for the television serial.

The serial was also parodied by the BBC television comedy series &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;The Horror Serial&quot;, transmitted the week following the final episode. In it, Tony Hancock has just finished watching the final episode of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, and becomes convinced that there is a crashed Martian space ship buried at the end of his garden. It is in fact an unexploded bomb, although Hancock claims that the warning &quot;Achtung!&quot; is really the Martian for Acton. This episode no longer exists in the BBC&#x27;s archives, but a private collector&#x27;s audio-only recording has been discovered, and released publicly on the &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour Collectibles Volume One&quot; CD box set.

It was parodied a third time in a sketch from the final series of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; in 1986: the sketch featured a guest appearance by Joanna Lumley.

<doc id="679077" wikidata="Q271100" url="?curid=679077" title="Bonnie Pink">
<text>, known by her stage name Bonnie Pink, is a Japanese singer-songwriter and musician. She writes and composes all her songs, and plays guitar and piano. Asada has said that the name Bonnie Pink is random and has no special meaning; she chose it because it was easy to remember and because she thought the words were cute together.

==History==
Bonnie Pink debuted in 1995 with the single &quot;Orenji&quot;, under her real name, Asada Kaori. Her first album, &quot;Blue Jam&quot;, was released that same year under the Pony Canyon record label. She described it as a &quot;mixture of bitter honey, blues music, momentary silence, irresistible madness, teardrops, sour grapes, hopeful bombs, big big love, and a few green apples&quot; in the jacket. It introduced her unique style of music that has been defined as an off-beat mix between jazz, blues, pop, and rock. The next year Bonnie Pink produced an album together with artists Tore Johansson, Swedish producer for The Cardigans, and Mitchell Froom. The song &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Rain!&quot; was the fifth ending of the popular &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime. She wrote her third album, &quot;Evil &amp; Flowers&quot; (1998), while in isolation in the Swedish countryside. She hoped to find inspiration there, but became depressed. She put her feelings of frustration into the songs. 
She went to New York alone to take a vacation and to study music after having released her third album in 1998. She went back in 1999 and contracted with Warner Music Japan.

===&quot;Let Go&quot;===
On her fourth album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, she worked with Mitchell Froom, New York producer of Elvis Costello, Cibo Matto, and Suzanne Vega. He gave her co-production credit for the album because he was so impressed with her. Her fifth album, &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, came out in 2001. The next year she collaborated with other artists and released &quot;Re-Pink&quot;, a remix album. &quot;Present&quot; came out in 2003 and &quot;Even So&quot; in 2004. &quot;Golden Tears&quot;, which features the single &quot;So Wonderful&quot;, came out in 2005, and she performed at SXSW that same year as part of Japan Nite.

===&quot;Love Is Bubble&quot;===
Bonnie Pink released the single &quot;Love Is Bubble&quot; in May 2006. Her June 2006 single &quot;A Perfect Sky&quot;, featured in an Anessa makeup commercial with popular model Yuri Ebihara, reached number 5 on the Oricon singles charts, making it the most successful single in Bonnie Pink&#x27;s career. Her &quot;best of&quot; album sold out quickly on Amazon Japan and reached number two on the Oricon charts and continued to chart in the top 30 becoming one of the top selling albums of the year. In November 2006, she was featured in M-Flo&#x27;s single &quot;Love Song&quot;. The single was a hit for both M-Flo and Bonnie Pink, and debuted at number 7 on the Oricon daily charts and reached number 9 on the Oricon weekly chart, gaining Bonnie Pink another top 10 single.

===Themes for anime===
Her song &quot;Cotton Candy&quot; was used as the ending theme for the anime &quot;&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Love Is Bubble&quot; was the theme song for the Japanese movie &quot;Memories of Matsuko&quot;, in which she also featured. Her single &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, which appears as the last song on her greatest hits album, was the ending theme to the popular &quot;Gantz&quot; anime.

===&quot;Anything for You&quot;===
Bonnie Pink&#x27;s single &quot;Anything for You&quot;, although not as successful as &quot;A Perfect Sky&quot;, still reached number 9 on the Oricon charts, achieving moderate success. Bonnie Pink, shortly after releasing her previous single, began performing on popular TV music shows and promoting her latest single, &quot;Water Me&quot;, which was the theme song for the popular TV drama &quot;Watashitachi no Kyōkasho&quot; (&quot;Our Textbooks&quot;) a dark, melancholy drama about a young girl&#x27;s suicide and the effect on her school. The single &quot;Water Me&quot; reached number 6 on Oricon on its release date and number 8 on the weekly charts. On 7 July 2007, Bonnie Pink performed at Live Earth in Kyoto.

===&quot;Thinking Out Loud&quot;===
Bonnie Pink&#x27;s album &quot;Thinking Out Loud&quot; was released on 25 July 2007, her first album to be sold in both CD and CD+DVD formats. The first press of both editions came with an access ticket containing the AD/Password to reserve tickets for her tour, &quot;Bonnie Pink Tour 2007 &#x27;Thinking Out Loud&#x27; Final at Nippon Budokan&quot; on a special designated website. The CD pre-orders made the album number 1 on the Amazon.com Japan Top Sellers. The album debuted at number 4 on the Oricon Daily Charts and number 5 on the weekly charts selling approximately 53,605 copies. As of 5 September 2007, her album had sold approximately 90,000 copies. Bonnie Pink was on her &quot;Thinking Out Loud Tour&quot; from late 2007 to early 2008.

===&quot;I and Ai&quot;===
In April 2008, Bonnie Pink made a guest performances for Domoto Tsuyoshi&#x27;s solo project 244 Endli-x album &quot;I and Ai&quot;. She was featured on the last track, &quot;Say Anything&quot;, which she wrote the lyrics to with Domoto.

===&quot;Ring a Bell&quot;===
The English version of Bonnie Pink&#x27;s single &quot;Ring a Bell&quot; was used as the theme song for the American release of the Xbox 360 game &quot;Tales of Vesperia&quot;. The single was released in Japan and America on iTunes to celebrate Bonnie Pink&#x27;s 35th birthday. Its Japanese counterpart, &quot;Kane o Narashite&quot;, was released on 6 August 2008. Bonnie Pink&#x27;s thirtieth single, &quot;Joy / Happy Ending&quot;, was released on 8 April 2009. &quot;One&quot;, her 10th studio album, followed on 13 May 2009.

<text>The Bell XV-15 is an American tiltrotor VTOL aircraft. It was the second successful experimental tiltrotor aircraft and the first to demonstrate the concept&#x27;s high speed performance relative to conventional helicopters.

==Development==
===Early VTOL rotor aircraft===
The idea of building VTOL aircraft using helicopter-like rotors at the wingtips originated in the 1930s. The first design resembling modern tiltrotors was patented by George Lehberger in May 1930, but he did not develop the concept further. In World War II, a German prototype called the Focke-Achgelis Fa 269 was developed starting in 1942, but it never flew.

Two prototypes that made it to flight were the one-seat Transcendental Model 1-G and two-seat Transcendental Model 2, both powered by single reciprocating engines. Development started on the Model 1-G in 1947, and it flew in 1954. The Model 1-G flew until a crash in Chesapeake Bay on 20 July 1955, destroying the prototype aircraft but not seriously injuring the pilot. The Transcendental 1-G was the first tiltrotor aircraft to have flown, and it accomplished most of a helicopter-to-aircraft transition in flight to within ten degrees of true horizontal aircraft flight. The Model 2 was developed and flew shortly afterward, but it did not fly much beyond hover tests. The United States Air Force withdrew funding in favor of the Bell XV-3.

The Bell XV-3 was first flown in 1955. Like its predecessors, the XV-3 had the engines in the fuselage and driveshafts transferring power out to tilting wingtip rotor assemblies.

Other rotor concepts, such as slowed rotors, stopped rotors, folding rotors, and variable-diameter rotors, were investigated for subsequent designs, but Bell engineers Kenneth Wernicke and Bob Lichten deemed them unfeasible compared to experience with the XV-3 project.

===Technological advances===
One of the major problems with the early tiltrotor aircraft designs was that the driveshafts carrying power from the fuselage out to the wingtip rotors, along with the gearbox and tilting mechanisms at the wingtips, had substantial loads placed upon them and were heavy. They were transferring large amounts of power and torque long distances for an aircraft power transmission system.

The XV-15 experimental aircraft introduced a major design concept advance: instead of engines in the fuselage, the XV-15 moved the engines out to the rotating wingtip pods, directly coupled to the rotors. The normal path for power was directly from the engine into a speed-reduction gearbox and into the rotor/propeller without any long shafts involved. There was still a driveshaft along the wings for emergency use to transfer power to the opposite rotor in case of engine failure, but that shaft did not normally carry any power loads, allowing it to be lighter.

The tilting engine concept introduced complexities in the design of the engines and engine pods to be able to shift from operating horizontally to operating vertically. Those problems were addressed fairly early in the XV-15 program.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, NASA and other researchers worked extensively on theoretical and wind tunnel tests of various rotor pods. Two companies were involved in the research and proposing designs: Bell Helicopter and Boeing Vertol. The focus was on tilt-rotor pods, integration of the tilting rotors with the wings and fuselage of the aircraft, and studying the airflow as the rotors tilted. Tilt rotors with fixed rotors and with folding rotors were investigated.

===XV-15 project===

What was to become the XV-15 program was launched in 1971 at NASA Ames Research Center. After preliminary work, a competition was held to award two $0.5 million research and development contracts for prototype designs. Companies that responded included Sikorsky Aircraft, Grumman Aircraft, Boeing Vertol, and Bell Helicopter.

R&amp;D contracts were issued to Bell Helicopter and Boeing Vertol on 20 October 1972. The two companies&#x27; design proposals were delivered on 22 January 1973.

====Competing designs====
Boeing Vertol proposed its Model 222 (not to be confused with the later Bell 222 conventional helicopter), in which the engines were in fixed pods at the end of each wing, and a small, rotating pod with the rotor was slightly closer to the fuselage on the wing. This design simplified the engine design by keeping it horizontal at all times without having very long driveshafts to the tilting rotors.

In the Bell design, Bell Model 301, the whole wingtip pod rotated between horizontal and vertical, with the engine and rotor assembly fixed together within the pod. This simplified the power transmission, but it had more complicated requirements for the engine design and was probably slightly heavier than the Boeing proposal.

After a review of both proposals, NASA selected the Bell 301 for further development, and a contract for further R&amp;D was issued on 31 July 1973. Extensive engineering and testing took the next four years to complete the development of the aircraft. The first of two Bell XV-15s, tail number N702NA, first flew on 3 May 1977. After minimal flight tests at the Bell test facility, the aircraft was moved to Ames Research Center in Sunnyvale, California, where it was then mounted in the large Ames wind tunnel and tested extensively in various simulated flight environments.

For the U.S. Department of Defense Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program, Bell Helicopter and Boeing Vertol teamed to submit a bid for an enlarged version of the XV-15 in 1983. The Bell Boeing team received a preliminary design contract that year, which led to the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey.

==Flight testing==

Following wind tunnel and flight testing by Bell, the aircraft was then moved to NASA Dryden, which is at Edwards Air Force Base in the California High Desert. The XV-15 flight testing continued expanding its flight envelope. It was able to successfully operate in both helicopter and normal aircraft flight modes and smoothly transition between the two. Once the aircraft was considered sufficiently tested, it was returned to Ames Research Center for further testing.

The XV-15s were deemed sufficiently tested, and one aircraft was taken to the 1981 Paris Air Show for demonstration flights. The &quot;New York Times&quot; praised its performance. &quot;And if ever there was a lovable plane, it is the Bell XV-15... The machine, the hit of the show, performed a series of maneuvers including bowing to the crowd.&quot; Over the next year, Senator Barry Goldwater, Navy Secretary John Lehman, and other officials were offered guest co-piloting flights to promote tiltrotor technology for military development.

The XV-15s were a standard demonstration in the annual summer airshow at the co-located Moffett Field Naval Air Station for several years during the 1980s. Both XV-15s were flown actively throughout the 1980s testing aerodynamics and tiltrotor applications for civilian and military aircraft types that might follow.

The Fédération Aéronautique Internationale classifies the XV-15 as a Rotodyne, and as such it holds the speed record of , and the 3 km and 6 km time-to-climb. 

===Further testing===
The first XV-15 prototype aircraft, N702NA, was transferred back to Bell for company development and demonstration use. On 20 August 1992, the aircraft crashed while being flown by a guest test pilot. He was lifting off for a final hover when a bolt slipped out of the collective control system on one pylon, causing that rotor to go to full pitch. The aircraft rolled upside down out of control and crashed inverted. While significantly damaged, the aircraft was largely structurally intact and both the pilot and copilot escaped with only minor injuries from the crash. The cockpit of the aircraft was salvaged and converted for use as a flight simulator.

The second XV-15 prototype, N703NA, was used for tests supporting the military V-22 Osprey program and Bell/Agusta BA609 civilian transport (still under development in 2023 as the AgustaWestland AW609). It continued in primarily NASA test operations until September 2003. The shortest takeoff distance was achieved with the nacelles at 75 degrees angle.

After N703NA was retired from test operations, it was donated to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The XV-15 was flown cross-country from Fort Worth, Texas to the museum before being decommissioned for display. It is now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles International Airport.

<doc id="679079" wikidata="Q649676" url="?curid=679079" title="Alice and Bob">
<text>Alice and Bob are fictional characters commonly used as placeholders in discussions about cryptographic systems and protocols, and in other science and engineering literature where there are several participants in a thought experiment. The Alice and Bob characters were created by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in their 1978 paper &quot;A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-key Cryptosystems&quot;. Subsequently, they have become common archetypes in many scientific and engineering fields, such as quantum cryptography, game theory and physics. As the use of Alice and Bob became more widespread, additional characters were added, sometimes each with a particular meaning. These characters do not have to refer to people; they refer to generic agents which might be different computers or even different programs running on a single computer.

== Overview ==
Alice and Bob are the names of fictional characters used for convenience and to aid comprehension. For example, &quot;How can Bob send a private message M to Alice in a public-key cryptosystem?&quot; is believed to be easier to describe and understand than if the hypothetical people were simply named &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; as in &quot;How can B send a private message M to A in a public-key cryptosystem?&quot;

The names are conventional, and where relevant may use an alliterative mnemonic such as &quot;Mallory&quot; for &quot;malicious&quot; to associate the name with the typical role of that person.

== History ==
Scientific papers about thought experiments with several participants often used letters to identify them: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, etc.

The first mention of Alice and Bob in the context of cryptography was in Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman&#x27;s 1978 article &quot;A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems.&quot; They wrote, &quot;For our scenarios we suppose that A and B (also known as Alice and Bob) are two users of a public-key cryptosystem&quot;. Previous to this article, cryptographers typically referred to message senders and receivers as A and B, or other simple symbols. In fact, in the two previous articles by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, introducing the RSA cryptosystem, there is no mention of Alice and Bob. The choice of the first three names may have come from the film &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;.

Within a few years, however, references to Alice and Bob in cryptological literature became a common trope. Cryptographers would often begin their academic papers with reference to Alice and Bob. For instance, Michael Rabin began his 1981 paper, &quot;Bob and Alice each have a secret, SB and SA, respectively, which they want to exchange.&quot; Early on, Alice and Bob were starting to appear in other domains, such as in Manuel Blum&#x27;s 1981 article, &quot;Coin Flipping by Telephone: A Protocol for Solving Impossible Problems,&quot; which begins, &quot;Alice and Bob want to flip a coin by telephone.&quot;

Although Alice and Bob were invented with no reference to their personality, authors soon began adding colorful descriptions. In 1983, Blum invented a backstory about a troubled relationship between Alice and Bob, writing, &quot;Alice and Bob, recently divorced, mutually distrustful, still do business together. They live on opposite coasts, communicate mainly by telephone, and use their computers to transact business over the telephone.&quot; In 1984, John Gordon delivered his famous &quot;After Dinner Speech&quot; about Alice and Bob, which he imagines to be the first &quot;definitive biography of Alice and Bob.&quot;

In addition to adding backstories and personalities to Alice and Bob, authors soon added other characters, with their own personalities. The first to be added was Eve, the &quot;eavesdropper.&quot; Eve was invented in 1988 by Charles Bennet, Gilles Brassard, and Jean-Marc Robert, in their paper, &quot;Privacy Amplification by Public Discussion.&quot; In Bruce Schneier&#x27;s book &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;, other characters are listed.

==Cast of characters==

===Cryptographic systems===
The most common characters are Alice and Bob. Eve, Mallory, and Trent are also common names, and have fairly well-established &quot;personalities&quot; (or functions). The names often use alliterative mnemonics (for example, Eve, &quot;eavesdropper&quot;; Mallory, &quot;malicious&quot;) where different players have different motives. Other names are much less common and more flexible in use. Sometimes the genders are alternated: Alice, Bob, Carol, Dave, Eve, etc.

===Interactive proof systems===

For interactive proof systems there are other characters:
=== Physics ===
The names Alice and Bob are often used to name the participants in thought experiments in physics. More alphabetical names, usually of alternating gender, are used as required, e.g. &quot;Alice and Bob (and Carol and Dick and Eve)&quot;.

In experiments involving robotic systems, the terms &quot;Alice Robot&quot; and &quot;Bob Robot&quot; refer to mobile platforms responsible for transmitting quantum information and receiving it with quantum detectors, respectively, within the context of the field of quantum robotics.

<doc id="679080" wikidata="Q153529" url="?curid=679080" title="Duchy of Milan">
<text>The Duchy of Milan (; ) was a state in Northern Italy, created in 1395 by Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then the lord of Milan, and a member of the important Visconti family, which had been ruling the city since 1277. At that time, it included twenty-six towns and the wide rural area of the middle Padan Plain east of the hills of Montferrat. During much of its existence, it was wedged between Savoy to the west, Republic of Venice to the east, the Swiss Confederacy to the north, and separated from the Mediterranean by Republic of Genoa to the south. The duchy was at its largest at the beginning of the 15th century, at which time it included almost all of what is now Lombardy and parts of what are now Piedmont, Veneto, Tuscany, and Emilia-Romagna.

Under the House of Sforza, Milan experienced a period of great prosperity with the introduction of the silk industry, becoming one of the wealthiest states during the Renaissance. From the late 15th century, the Duchy of Milan was contested between the forces of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Kingdom of France. It was ruled by Habsburg Spain from 1556 and it passed to Habsburg Austria in 1707 during the War of the Spanish Succession as a vacant Imperial fief. The duchy remained an Austrian possession until 1796 when a French army under Napoleon Bonaparte conquered it, and it ceased to exist a year later as a result of the Treaty of Campo Formio, when Austria ceded it to the new Cisalpine Republic.

After the defeat of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna of 1815 restored many other states which he had destroyed but not the Duchy of Milan. Instead, its former territory became part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, with the Emperor of Austria as its king. In 1859, Lombardy was ceded to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia, which became the Kingdom of Italy in 1861.

==History==
=== Background ===
The fate of the city of Milan was intertwined since the 13th century with that of the Visconti family, who resumed the policy of territorial expansionism inherited from the city&#x27;s municipality. One of the first Visconti exponents to lead the Lombard city was Ottone Visconti, elected archbishop in 1262 and who defeated the Della Torre family in the Battle of Desio in 1277.

In the first half of the following century, his nephews and great-grandsons who came to govern Milan: Matteo I, Galeazzo I, Azzone and the Archbishop Giovanni, expanding the area of Visconti influence over the surrounding regions. An equal policy of enlargement and consolidation was pursued in the second half of the century by their successors: Matteo II, Bernabò and Gian Galeazzo. After a period marked by tensions between the various members of the powerful family, Gian Galeazzo Visconti, nephew of Bernabò, came to power with a coup in 1385 and gradually unified the vast family domains scattered across Northern Italy. It is said that the territories subject to his dominion earned Gian Galeazzo in one year, in addition to the ordinary income of 1,200,000 gold florins, another 800,000 in extraordinary subsidies.

===Visconti rule (1395–1447)===
The duchy was officially established on 11 May 1395, when Gian Galeazzo Visconti, the &quot;Dominus Generalis&quot; of Milan, obtained the title of Duke of Milan by means of a diploma signed in Prague by Wenceslaus of Bohemia. The nomination was ratified and celebrated in Milan on 5 September 1395. Gian Galeazzo Visconti also obtained the &quot;license&quot; to quarter the Visconti&#x27;s biscione with the imperial eagle in the new ducal flag.

The duchy, as defined in the diploma of 1395, included the territory surrounding Milan, between the Adda and Ticino rivers, but the dominions of Gian Galeazzo Visconti extended beyond, including 26 towns and spanned from Piedmont to Veneto and from present-day Canton of Ticino to Umbria. Milan thus became one of the five major states of the Italian peninsula in the 15th century. The House of Visconti had been expanding their dominions for nearly a century, under the reigns of Azzone Visconti, Luchino Visconti, Giovanni Visconti, Bernabò Visconti and Gian Galeazzo Visconti: during the rule of Azzone Visconti, the Ossola in Piedmont had been conquered in 1331, followed by Bergamo and Pavia (Lombardy) and Novara (Piedmont) in 1332, Pontremoli (Tuscany) in 1333, Vercelli (Piedmont) and Cremona (Lombardy) in 1334, the Lombard cities of Como, Crema, Lodi and the Valtellina in 1335, Bormio (Lombardy) and Piacenza (Emilia) in 1336, and Brescia and the Val Camonica in 1337.

The brothers Luchino and Giovanni Visconti added Bellinzona (present-day Switzerland in 1342, Parma (Emilia) in 1346 and several territories in southwestern Piedmont in 1347: Tortona, Alessandria, Asti, and Mondovì. Bernabò conquered Reggio Emilia in 1371 and Riva del Garda in 1380, and Gian Galeazzo greatly expanded Milan&#x27;s dominions, first eastwards, with the conquest of the Venetian cities of Verona (1387), Vicenza (1387), Feltre (1388), Belluno (1388) and Padua (briefly, from 1388 to 1390), and later southwards, conquering Lucca, Pisa and Siena in Tuscany in 1399, Perugia in Umbria in 1400, Bologna in Emilia in 1402, and Assisi in Umbria also in 1402.

===Ambrosian Republic (1447–1450)===

When the last Visconti duke, Filippo Maria, died in 1447 without a male heir, the Milanese declared the so-called Golden Ambrosian Republic, which soon faced revolts and attacks from its neighbors. In 1450 mercenary captain Francesco Sforza, having previously married Filippo Maria Visconti&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Bianca Maria, conquered the city and restored the duchy, founding the House of Sforza.

===First Sforza&#x27;s rule (1450–1499)===
The Venetian republic had not abandoned its desire to expand into Lombardy and therefore entered into an alliance with Alfonso V of Aragon, King of Naples, and with Emperor Frederick III, against Francesco I Sforza and his allies. The fall of Constantinople, conquered by the Ottoman Turks, however, endangered the structure of the Venetian possessions in the Aegean Sea and after 4 years of war the Peace of Lodi was signed in 1454. With this document Francesco Sforza and Alfonso of Aragon were recognized respectively as Duke of Milan and King of Naples, the Republic of Venice extended its dominion up to the Adda and the Holy Italian League against the Turks was concluded.

The political balance achieved with the Peace of Lodi lasted until the death of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, ruler of the Florentine Republic, and the incursion of King Charles VIII of France into Italy in 1494, except for some Swiss incursions which resulted in the Peace of Lucerne. Galeazzo Maria, son of Francesco Sforza, due to his government considered by many to be tyrannical, was murdered in a conspiracy. His son, Gian Galeazzo, governed under the regency of his mother Bona of Savoy, until his uncle, Ludovico il Moro usurped the throne of the duchy. Ludovico il Moro, son of Francesco Sforza, managed to obtain the guardianship of his nephew Gian Galeazzo and confine him to the Visconti Castle of Pavia, where in 1494 he died in such mysterious circumstances that many suspicions gathered around Ludovico himself.

Relations between Ludovico and Ferdinand II of Aragon therefore deteriorated: Gian Galeazzo had in fact married a niece of the King of Naples, who took the side of the legitimate heir. Ludovico il Moro responded by encouraging King Charles VIII of France to reclaim the Kingdom of Naples, as until 1442 the Neapolitan throne had belonged to Charles ancestors, the Capetian House of Anjou. In 1494, Charles VIII conquered Naples, upsetting the balance between the various Italian states and starting the Italian Wars.

===First French rule (1499–1512)===
In 1495 Charles VIII was expelled from the Peninsula by a League composed of many Italian states, the Holy Roman Empire, the Spanish Empire and the Kingdom of England, but only three years later, in 1498, the Duke of Orléans, who had become King of France with the name of Louis XII, assert his claims on the Duchy of Milan: one of his ancestors, Louis of Orleans, had in fact married Valentina Visconti, daughter of Duke Gian Galeazzo, in 1389, whose marriage contract established that, in the event of the extinction of the Visconti dynasty, the title of Duke of Milan went to Valentina&#x27;s descendants. Louis XII, claiming to be the legitimate heir of the Viscontis, invaded the Milanese state in 1499, driving out Ludovico il Moro. The former Sforza ruler tried in vain to counter the transalpine troops, even asking the Emperor for help, but only managed to briefly recapture the capital and a few other lands. Defeated and taken prisoner in Novara in 1500, he was deported to France, to the Castle of Loches, where he died on 27 May 1508.

=== Second Sforza&#x27;s rule (1512–1515) ===
Louis XII remained Duke of Milan until 1512, when the Swiss army expelled the French from Lombardy and placed Maximilian Sforza, son of Ludovico il Moro, on the Milanese throne. Between 1512 and 1515 the Swiss cantons &quot;de facto&quot; controlled the duchy.

=== Second French rule (1515–1521) ===
Under the reign of King Francis I, the French Crown managed to re-establish its sovereignty over the Milanese duchy. In 1515, after the bloody Battle of Marignano, which saw the defeat of the Swiss army, the French sovereign deposed Maximilian and installed himself on the ducal throne. Despite the defeat, the Swiss managed to retain the territories along the road that leads from the Gotthard Pass to the gates of Como (today&#x27;s Canton of Ticino). The Treaty of Noyon of 1516 confirmed the possession of the Duchy of Milan to the French. Francis of Valois governed the duchy until 1521, when Charles V, King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor, raised Maximilian&#x27;s young brother, Francesco II Sforza, to the throne of the duchy.

=== Third and last Sforza&#x27;s rule (1521–1535) ===
After the decisive French defeat in the Battle of Pavia on 24 February 1525, which left the forces of Charles V in a strong position within the Italian peninsula, Francesco II Sforza joined the League of Cognac against Charles: together with him, the Republic of Venice, the Florentine Republic, Pope Clement VII and the Kingdom of France. The Duke was quickly overwhelmed by Charles troops, but managed to maintain control over some cities and strongholds of the duchy. Thanks to the Republic of Venice which ceded the entire Apulian coast (Brindisi, Monopoli, Gallipoli, Polignano, Lecce, Bari and Trani) in exchange for the withdrawal of imperial claims on Milan, also due to the fact that Charles V did not want to clash with the Venetians, and he knew he didn&#x27;t have the means to succeed, because the Venetians were too concerned that Milan not fall into the hands of foreigners powers, given that they did not consider themselves &quot;capable of occupying it nor proportionate to be able to hold it&quot;.

Francesco II Sforza died without heirs in 1535, opening a new question for the succession to the throne. In this period, to be precise in 1532, Francesco II Sforza requested and obtained from Pope Clement VII the elevation of Vigevano, a city to which his family had always been deeply linked, to the capital of Vigevanasco, after it had obtained in 1530 the title of city and bishopric according to the same methods.

===Spanish Habsburg rule (1556–1707)===
The King Francis I of France and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor claimed the duchy by making war. The latter, claiming it as an imperial fief upon the extinction of the Sforza, obtained control of the duchy and installed his son Philip II there with an imperial diploma signed in Brussels on 11 October 1540 and made public in 1554. Philip&#x27;s possession of the duchy was finally recognized by King Henry II of France in 1559, with the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis. The duchy, having lost all forms of independence, was then reduced to a regional state subjected to foreign domination.

===Austrian Habsburg rule (1714–1796)===
With the Treaty of Baden, which ended the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duchy of Milan was ceded to the Austrian Habsburgs. During the 18th century, the surface area of the duchy—despite its unification in 1745 with the Duchy of Mantua, which had strong autonomy from Milan—was further reduced, reaching a much smaller extension than present-day Lombardy. The government of the Habsburgs of Austria was characterized by significant administrative reforms, which the sovereigns of the Austrian house—inspired by the principles of enlightened absolutism—also introduced in their Lombard territories: for example, the rearrangement of the land register, the suppression of ecclesiastical censorship and the development of the silk industry.

=== End of the Duchy ===
Following Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s victorious campaign in northern Italy in 1796, the duchy, entrusted to an interim government junta, was ceded to the French Republic by the Habsburgs with the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797. Already in 1796, the French had established the vassal state of the Transpadane Republic on the territories of the Duchy of Milan, which merged with the Cispadane Republic in 1797 to form the Cisalpine Republic, of which Milan became the capital. After the defeat of Napoleon, on the basis of the decisions taken by the Congress of Vienna on 9 June 1815, the Duchy of Milan was not restored but became part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, a constituent land of the Austrian Empire. The kingdom ceased to exist when the remaining portion of it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866.

==Military==
Under the Spanish viceroys from 1535, Milan became one of the contributors to the Spanish king&#x27;s army. At the time Lombardy had the most developed manufacturing and commercial economy anywhere in the world, making it a valuable tool for the Spanish military: an armory of paramount strategic importance. In addition to resources, Milan also provided soldiers. During the 1635–1659 Franco-Spanish War, Milan sent and paid for on average 4,000 soldiers per year to the Spanish crown, with many of these men serving in the Low Countries against the Dutch States Army.

<text>James Hunter (born 22 May 1948) is a historian of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. He is Emeritus Professor of History at the University of the Highlands and Islands. 

== Life ==
He completed his Ph.D. thesis at the University of Edinburgh before taking up a post with the Institute for the Study of Sparsely Populated Areas at the University of Aberdeen. In 2005 he founded the Centre for History in Dornoch as part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, and served as the head of the Centre between 2005 and 2010. 

He is a freelance historian and author, and has written numerous books on the Highlands and Islands and its global diaspora.

His recent books include &quot;Set Adrift Upon the World: The Sutherland Clearances&quot;, published in 2015. The book presents the struggle for survival of the people cleared from the straths of Sutherland during the early nineteenth century and relocated to Canada, landing at Hudson Bay. This book was the winner of the Saltire Society&#x27;s History Book of the Year Award in 2016. In 2019 his account of the Highland Famine of 1846–47, &quot;Insurrection: Scotland&#x27;s Famine Winter&quot; was published.

=== Outside academia ===
Hunter has held a number of additional posts outside of academia. He was the director of the Scottish Crofters Union (1985–1990), Chairman of the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust (2004–2007) and Chairman of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (1998–2004), the Inverness-based development and training agency for the North of Scotland.

== Awards and honours ==
Hunter gave the first Sabhal Mòr Lecture in 1990.

He was awarded a CBE in 2001 for his services to the Highlands and Islands.

He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2007.

<text>Five Towns College is a private college in Dix Hills, New York. The college&#x27;s degree programs focus on music, media, and the performing arts.

==History==
Founded in 1972, Five Towns College holds an Absolute Charter issued by the New York State Board of Regents. The college&#x27;s name comes from the original proposed campus, which was to be in Lawrence in southwestern Nassau County, New York, an area known as &quot;The Five Towns&quot;. However, the college never opened in that location. Its first campus was in Merrick, New York (1973–1982). Its second campus was in Seaford, New York (1982–1992). The college acquired its permanent home in Dix Hills in 1992 and relocated there for the fall 1992 semester.

==Academics==
The college offers associate, bachelor, master&#x27;s and doctoral degree programs through eight academic divisions. These include music performance, theatre arts, mass communications, film and television, business management, liberal arts, interactive media arts, and music teacher education. Popular majors include audio recording technology, broadcasting, musical theatre, music performance, and business administration and management.

It was the first in New York State to offer programs focusing on jazz and commercial music, audio recording technology, and music business.

Its programs of study are registered by the New York State Education Department. The college is institutionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It also holds programmatic accreditation by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and by the National Association of Schools of Music.

Five Towns&#x27; Lorraine Kleinman and Stanley G. Cohen Memorial Library/Learning Resource Center offers digital and bound collections of material to support its academic programs. The library also includes an Educational Technology Center for the training and development of online learning skills for students and faculty.

==Student life==
Approximately one-third of Five Towns College students reside on-campus in the college&#x27;s Living/Learning Center - a complex of four residence halls with private bathrooms, student center and music practice rooms.

The college is also home to the John Lennon Center for Music and Technology, which contains sound recording studios, a film sound stage, an interactive computer graphics lab, and a student-run radio station. The college is also equipped with a MIDI studio, film editing lab, and piano/keyboard lab.

The school&#x27;s main stage, the Five Towns College Performing Arts Center, consists of a fully rigged stage with seating for 486. The college also includes a smaller performance studio, costume shop, and set design and construction workshop.

The college offers academic and financial support services such as counseling, academic advising, tutoring, and the provision of accommodations for students with documented learning disabilities through its Student Success Center. In addition, Five Towns College offers the only Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) on Long Island, which provides additional support services for students who are designated as both academically and economically disadvantaged by the New York State Education Department.

===Athletics===
The Five Towns College Sound Athletic Department is a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association and competes as a full member of the Hudson Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. The college&#x27;s mascot is Fader the Seagull.

The college offers men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, and soccer. In 2021, it began to offer competition in esports and cross country. In 2022, the department announced that it would offer men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse.

Home games are broadcast from Studio 400, the college&#x27;s television lab.

===Media===

Five Towns College annually hosts the Long Island Media Arts Show.

Scripted video productions are produced through the college&#x27;s Film/Television Center.

The college operates a broadcast transmission facility for its FCC-licensed radio station at Riverhead, NY under the call sign WFTU. The station broadcasts at 1570 AM and streams over the Internet. On May 16, 2018, Five Towns obtained a construction permit from the FCC for a broadcast translator in order to begin FM broadcast operations at the frequency 104.9. Though the translator has been licensed, WFTU has yet to begin public FM transmission.

<text>In the US, a chartered mark is a trademark or service mark which is given special statutory protection separate from the usual registration of trade marks and service marks. A chartered mark, in effect, is a type of trademark/servicemark in which the organization is granted the mark &quot;by charter&quot;, i.e. by express grant of the legislature. When an organization is granted a chartered mark, no one else may use the same mark at all for any purpose. (There are possible exceptions for organizations using the same or a similar mark before it was chartered.)

Examples of chartered marks in the United States include FDIC for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts for the Boy Scouts of America and the Girl Scouts of the USA, respectively; and Olympic for the United States Olympic Committee.

<doc id="679107" wikidata="Q9291749" url="?curid=679107" title="Pedro the Lion">
<text>Pedro the Lion is an American indie rock band from Seattle, Washington, United States. David Bazan formed the band in 1995 and represented its main creative force, backed by a varying rotation of collaborating musicians. In 2006 Pedro the Lion was dissolved as Bazan went solo and performed under his own name. Bazan reformed the band and resumed performing under the Pedro the Lion moniker in late 2017. Releasing seven full-length albums and five EPs since 1997, the band is known for its first person narrative lyrics.

== History ==
Pedro the Lion was formed by David Bazan in 1995. The name of the band comes from a character that would have been interwoven into the band&#x27;s first album. In 1997 they released their debut EP &quot;Whole&quot; with Bazan playing nearly every instrument, a format he continued on the band&#x27;s first two full-length albums, &quot;It&#x27;s Hard to Find a Friend&quot; (1998), and &quot;Winners Never Quit&quot; (2000).

&quot;Winners&quot; marked Pedro the Lion&#x27;s first concept album. After its completion, Bazan has claimed he initially decided not to continue writing concept albums. However, in the process of writing his next full-length &quot;Control&quot;, he realized he had inadvertently created a narrative link &quot;about 70% of the way through [the album]&quot; and decided to finish it in the same vein. The album&#x27;s thematic content criticizes American capitalism, which Bazan notes was largely inspired by the sentiments surrounding the World Trade Organization protests in 1999.

&quot;Control&quot; also saw Casey Foubert of Seattle-based Seldom join Pedro the Lion to play bass on the album. Additionally, Foubert co-wrote &quot;Penetration&quot; and &quot;Second Best&quot;, the third and eighth tracks, respectively, on the album, which was released in 2002. Among other collaborations with music artists, Foubert has subsequently worked as a touring musician for singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens and the Portland-based indie rock band, The Shins.

&quot;Achilles Heel&quot; followed, released on May 24, 2004, and marked the beginning of Bazan&#x27;s partnership with TW Walsh as the band&#x27;s primary writers and musicians. Bazan described the tracks in the fourth full-length from Pedro the Lion as a return to the songwriting characterized by &quot;Friend&quot; and the &quot;Secure&quot; EP in the sense that there was no &quot;pretense of anything bigger&quot;, an allusion to his previous concept albums.

In early January 2006, Pedro the Lion formally announced that they had split. The split was amicable; Bazan and Walsh continue to be good friends. Bazan said that their friendship has even been strengthened by the breakup. Bazan toured in support of &quot;Fewer Moving Parts&quot;, his solo debut EP. Walsh returned to his career as a Web application developer and is busy with his band, The Soft Drugs, and their debut release, &quot;In Moderation&quot;. David Bazan released his debut solo LP, &quot;Curse Your Branches&quot;, on Seattle-based Barsuk Records in 2009.

The Pedro The Lion catalog was remastered for vinyl by TW Walsh and reissued in 2012.

Bazan is a member of Overseas with Will Johnson of Centro-matic and Bubba &amp; Matt Kadane of Bedhead and The New Year. Their self-titled debut album was released on June 11, 2013.

Beginning in spring 2017, Bazan began forming a new band which he initially envisioned billing as &quot;David Bazan Band&quot; or something similar. In October 2017, Bazan announced that Pedro the Lion would be reforming beginning with several shows in December 2017. Asked if there would be new material, Bazan explained that the band will initially be playing Pedro the Lion&#x27;s existing catalog along with limited performances of songs from Headphones and Bazan&#x27;s solo catalog, with new material to follow.

<text>Margaret Pomeranz (born Margeret Anne Jones-Owen, 15 July 1944) is an Australian film critic, writer, producer, and television personality.

==Early life==
Pomeranz was born Margeret Anne Jones-Owen on 15 July 1944 in Waverley, a suburb of Sydney.

She was educated at the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, Sydney in Croydon, the then newly opened Macquarie University, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in German and social psychology, and the Playwright&#x27;s Studio at the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA).

In between her studies, she spent two-and-a-half years in Vienna, where she worked as a stringer for &quot;The Bulletin&quot; and ABC Rural Radio. She wrote stories about such things as Australian sales to Hungarian farmers, and the effects of the Russian wheat crop failing.

==Career==
Pomeranz joined the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) in 1980 as writer and producer, working on TV programs such &quot;Front Up&quot;, &quot;Subsonics&quot; and the AFI and IF Awards.

===With David Stratton===
She was appointed producer for David Stratton&#x27;s film presentations. Together with Stratton, she hosted the long-running SBS TV program &quot;The Movie Show&quot; from 30 October 1986 until 2004. From 1 July 2004 she appeared on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) version of the program, &quot;At the Movies&quot;, again with Stratton, concluding on 9 December 2014.

Two articles which analysed their reviews at SBS and ABC showed that Stratton was generally a slightly harsher critic than Pomeranz. At SBS, they only both gave five stars to four films: &quot;Evil Angels&quot; (1988), &quot;Return Home&quot; (1990), &quot;The Piano&quot; (1993), and &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001). At the ABC, they only both gave five stars to six films: &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005), &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot; (2005), &quot;No Country For Old Men&quot; (2007), &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (2009), &quot;A Separation&quot; (2011), and &quot;Amour&quot; (2012). They disagreed particularly on &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (David refusing to rate it because of the racist violence in the film), &quot;The Castle&quot; (1997), &quot;Last Train to Freo&quot; (2006), &quot;Human Touch&quot; (2004), and &quot;Kenny&quot; (2006), with Stratton awarding fewer stars than Pomeranz on all but &quot;Human Touch&quot;.

===Other activities===
In addition to being a critic, Pomeranz is also an anti-censorship campaigner. She was a prominent attendee and was briefly detained by police at an attempted 2003 protest screening of the controversial film &quot;Ken Park&quot;, banned in Australia. She has been critical of the Australian Office of Film and Literature Classification (now the Australian Classification Board), the Australian censorship body, on a number of occasions. She has also spoken out against production companies refusing to give preview screenings for critics.

On 29 January 2015, it was announced that Pomeranz had signed with Foxtel to present film and television programs on Foxtel Arts, along with Graeme Blundell, in a new series called &quot;Screen&quot;.

&quot;Screen&quot; stopped production in 2020, and past episodes are available on YouTube.

Pomeranz has appeared regularly on &quot;The Weekly with Charlie Pickering&quot; as a guest reviewer giving humorous reviews of TV shows, such as &quot;Married at First Sight&quot; &quot;Below Deck&quot;, and &quot;Love in the Jungle&quot;.

==Recognition and honours==
Pomeranz was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2005 Australia Day Honours.

In 2015, Pomeranz and Stratton were named patrons of the French Film Festival in Australia.

On 13 April 2016, Pomeranz and Stratton were both awarded honorary doctorates (Doctor of Letters) at Macquarie University, for their contribution to the film industry

In 2017, Pomeranz became the first woman to be honoured with a star on Winton&#x27;s Walk of Fame during The Vision Splendid Outback Film Festival in Winton, Queensland.

Pomeranz and Stratton received the Don Dunstan Award in 2018 and are both Patrons of the Adelaide Film Festival.

In May 2023, Pomeranz was awarded an honorary doctorate (Letters) from the University of Sydney &quot;for her impact on popular culture, film and performing arts&quot;.

==Cameos==
Pomeranz had an uncredited role in the 1994 film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot; as Adam&#x27;s mother.

She has also appeared as herself in several Australian comedy programs and promotions, including:
* 1993 Australian comedy film &quot;Hercules Returns&quot;.
* Australian sketch comedy show &quot;Full Frontal&quot; in a 1995 episode.
* A 2000 episode of Australian comedy show &quot;Pizza&quot;, a show known for celebrity cameos.
*&quot;Lawrence Leung&#x27;s Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; (2009), where she and David Stratton review Lawrence Leung&#x27;s attempt to set a world record for solving the Rubik&#x27;s Cube whilst sky diving, as they sit on the landing site in their trademark armchairs. 
*A 2010 video promoting the new Triple J breakfast team of Tom Ballard and Alex Dyson, where she joined the two men to &quot;satisfy the female demographic&quot;.

==Personal life==
She married Hans Pomeranz.
