<text>Craig MacTavish (born August 15, 1958) is a Canadian professional ice hockey executive and former player, formerly an assistant coaching position with the St. Louis Blues. He played center for 17 seasons in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins, Edmonton Oilers, New York Rangers, Philadelphia Flyers and St. Louis Blues, winning the Stanley Cup four times (1987, 1988, 1990, 1994). He was the last NHL player not to wear a helmet during games.

MacTavish later coached the Oilers from 2000 to 2009 and also served as assistant coach with the Rangers and Oilers. He last coached Team Canada at the 2019 Spengler Cup, after a short stint with Russian team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the KHL. He served as an assistant coach with the St. Louis Blues from 2022 to 2023.

==Early life and education==
MacTavish was born on August 15, 1958, in London, Ontario.

After retiring as NHL player in 1997, MacTavish was accepted as an MBA student at the University of Alberta. He didn&#x27;t start the program, following the decision to take a coaching position with the New York Rangers. In 2011, he obtained an EMBA from Queen&#x27;s School of Business.

==Career==
===Early career===
MacTavish played two years of NCAA hockey with the University of Lowell Chiefs (now University of Massachusetts Lowell River Hawks) from 1977 to 1979. He was drafted by the Boston Bruins in the 1978 NHL Entry Draft with their ninth pick, 153rd overall, and spent the next several years splitting time between the Bruins and various American Hockey League teams. He finally made the Bruins for good in 1982–83 and played two full seasons with them.

During his early days with the Bruins, the young MacTavish was involved in the infamous brawl between several Boston players and a group of New York Rangers fans in 1979.

MacTavish missed the 1984–85 season after being convicted of vehicular homicide, having struck and killed a young woman while he was driving under the influence of alcohol. MacTavish pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and driving under the influence of alcohol the night of January 25, 1984, in Peabody, Massachusetts. Kim Radley, 26, of West Newfield, Maine, died four days later of injuries sustained in the crash. MacTavish was sentenced to a year&#x27;s imprisonment for the offence. While incarcerated, he watched most of the games that were televised.

===Later career===
Widely viewed, at the time, as a personal favour from Edmonton coach Glen Sather to his best friend, then-Bruins general manager Harry Sinden (who felt that MacTavish ought to have a fresh start away from Boston and had offered to let him out of his contract, which MacTavish had accepted), the Oilers took a chance on MacTavish and signed him for the 1985–86 season. (Sather insisted, however, that MacTavish agree contractually that he would not ever be allowed to drive the team bus. MacTavish readily agreed to this contractual term.) Sather&#x27;s intuition turned out to be good, as MacTavish spent eight full seasons with the Oilers, helping them to win three Stanley Cups in 1987, 1988, 1990 and serving as team captain from 1992 to 1994. MacTavish was traded to the New York Rangers in 1994, just in time to help several other former Oilers (including Kevin Lowe, Glenn Anderson, Adam Graves, Jeff Beukeboom, Esa Tikkanen and Mark Messier) win the Stanley Cup.

The next season MacTavish signed with the Philadelphia Flyers as a free agent, and was traded to the St. Louis Blues during the 1995–96 season. MacTavish retired following the 1996–97 season. He was the last helmetless player, having signed a professional contract with the Bruins before the mandatory cutoff date in 1979 (then-current players were allowed to remain bare-headed under a grandfather clause); incidentally, MacTavish had worn a helmet in his earliest days as he can be seen wearing one during the aforementioned fight with Rangers fans in 1979.

===Coaching career===
MacTavish turned to coaching immediately after retiring as a player, signing on as an assistant with the Rangers. After two seasons in New York, he returned to the Oilers as an assistant coach in the 1999–2000 season under former teammate Kevin Lowe. He was subsequently promoted to the top job when Lowe succeeded Sather as general manager.

In the 2005–06 season, MacTavish led the Oilers on their run to the Stanley Cup Finals. In the first round of the playoffs, MacTavish shocked the hockey world by utilizing a trapping defensive system to neutralize a potent Detroit Red Wings offence. The Oilers were able to deny scoring chances by blocking shots with their bodies—something for which MacTavish was known for during his playing career. This proved effective; the eighth-seeded Oilers won the opening round in six games, against the no. 1 seed, the Detroit Red Wings for their first postseason victory since 1998. Along the way the Oilers defeated the San Jose Sharks in six games and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in five games to advance to their first Stanley Cup since their championship season of 1990. However, the Oilers could not complete their run, losing a thrilling seven-game final series to the Carolina Hurricanes after nearly rallying from a 3–1 series deficit to force a Game 7. As it would turn out, this was the only season in MacTavish&#x27;s tenure where the Oilers won a postseason series.

On November 4, 2006, one day after the Oilers lost to the Dallas Stars due to an apparent blown call in the last five seconds of the third period by referee Mick McGeough, MacTavish was fined $10,000 for expressing his anger after the game, referring to the call as &quot;retarded&quot;. After this incident, Oilers fans collected over $10,000 and gave it to MacTavish, who subsequently donated the money to charity.

On April 15, 2009, Oilers general manager Steve Tambellini announced that MacTavish had been relieved of his duties as head coach of the club. The Oilers had failed to reach the playoffs for the third year in a row. He finished his tenure with the Oilers at 36th on the all-time NHL list with 301 wins, and second on the Oilers&#x27; all-time wins list behind only Sather.

During the 2011–12 season, MacTavish coached the Chicago Wolves, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks. After the season, MacTavish left the Canucks organization, returned to the Oilers as Senior Vice-president of Hockey operations and was named general manager on April 15, 2013.

On December 15, 2014, MacTavish fired head coach Dallas Eakins from his duties as head coach of the Oilers. MacTavish named himself as interim coach with the intention of transitioning minor league coach Todd Nelson into the role of interim head coach in the near future.

On May 16, 2019, he returned to coaching, signing a two-year contract with the Russian KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl. On September 24, 2019, it was announced that Lokomotiv Yaroslav fired MacTavish after only eight games. In December 2019, he served as head coach of Team Canada and led the squad to the title at the Spengler Cup. He took over the head coaching job at Swiss team Lausanne HC on February 27, 2020.

On July 1, 2022, MacTavish was hired by the St. Louis Blues as an assistant coach for the 2022-2023 season, after the Boston Bruins acquired Jim Montgomery as their head coach. In April 2023, the Blues announced that MacTavish, along with fellow assistant coach Mike Van Ryn, would not return for the next season.

===TSN commentator===
Failing to be picked up by another team in the coaching department, on September 21, 2009, MacTavish began the first of twenty-five in-studio appearances with TSN as a hockey commentator.

===Management career===
On June 11, 2012, Edmonton Oilers general manager Steve Tambellini announced that McTavish was added to the club&#x27;s hockey operations management team as senior vice-president of hockey operations.

On April 15, 2013, general manager Steve Tambellini was relieved of his position, and the Oilers named MacTavish as the new general manager. Former Columbus Blue Jackets GM Scott Howson replaced MacTavish as the vice-president of hockey operations.

On April 24, 2015, Oilers Entertainment Group CEO, Bob Nicholson announced that Peter Chiarelli had been hired as the new general manager and president of hockey operations. Nicholson did not provide details on what MacTavish&#x27;s new position would be within the Oilers organization.

On September 12, 2015, general manager Peter Chiarelli revealed in an interview with TSN&#x27;s Bob McKenzie that MacTavish had been given the title of Vice-president of Hockey Operations; most of his duties would circulate around the Oilers&#x27; new affiliate team the Bakersfield Condors, his other main focus will be on pro scouting.

==Personal life==
MacTavish and his wife Debbie have a daughter and two sons.

While playing with the Flyers, MacTavish was a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey.

<text>Heriot-Watt University () is a public research university based in Edinburgh, Scotland. It was established in 1821 as the School of Arts of Edinburgh, the world&#x27;s first mechanics&#x27; institute, and was subsequently granted university status by royal charter in 1966. It is the eighth-oldest higher education institution in the United Kingdom. The name Heriot-Watt was taken from Scottish inventor James Watt and Scottish philanthropist and goldsmith George Heriot.

The annual income of the institution for 2022–23 was £259.5 million of which £33 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £266.7 million. Known for its focus on science as well as engineering, it is one of the 23 colleges that were granted university status in the 1960s, and it is sometimes considered a plate glass university, like Lancaster and Warwick.

The university has three campuses in Scotland and one each in the UAE and Malaysia.

== History ==
=== School of Arts of Edinburgh ===

Heriot-Watt was established as the School of Arts of Edinburgh (not to be confused with Edinburgh College of Art) by Scottish businessman Leonard Horner on 16 October 1821. Having been inspired by Anderson&#x27;s College in Glasgow, Horner established the school to provide practical knowledge of science and technology to Edinburgh&#x27;s working men. The institution was initially of modest size, giving lectures two nights a week in rented rooms and it had a small library of around 500 technical works. It was also oversubscribed, with admissions soon closing despite the cost of 15 shillings for a year&#x27;s access to lectures and the library.

The school was managed by a board of eighteen directors and primarily funded by sponsors from the middle and upper classes, including Robert Stevenson and Walter Scott. It first became associated with the inventor and engineer James Watt in 1824, as a means of raising funds to secure permanent accommodation. Justifying the association, School Director Lord Cockburn said:

&quot;[The building] shall be employed for the accommodation of the Edinburgh School of Arts; whereby the memory of Watt may forever be connected with the promotion, among a class of men to which he himself originally belonged, of those mechanical arts from which his own usefulness and glory arose. &quot;

In 1837, the School of Arts moved to leased accommodation on Adam Square, which it purchased in 1851 with funds raised in Watt&#x27;s name. In honour of the purchase, the School changed its name to the Watt Institution and School of Arts in 1852. The statue of Watt was added in front of the Adam Square school in 1854 and has since moved as the premises moved.

=== Watt Institution and School of Arts ===

Heriot-Watt&#x27;s time as the Watt Institution marked a transitional period for the organisation, as its curriculum broadened to include several subjects beyond mathematics and the physical sciences. While the School of Arts had catered almost exclusively to working-class artisans and technical workers, the Watt Institution admitted a large number of middle-class students, whom it attracted with new subjects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By 1885, the skilled working class were no longer the majority in an institution that had been created explicitly for them.

A shifting class make-up was not the only demographic change to affect the student body: in 1869 women were permitted to attend lectures for the first time. This move put the Watt Institution some way ahead of Scottish universities, who were only permitted to allow women to graduate 20 years later following the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889. The decision to admit women was made in large part owing to pressure from local campaigner Mary Burton, who later became the institution&#x27;s first female director in 1874.

In 1870, the Watt Institution was forced to move when Adam Square was demolished. After a brief period on Roxburgh Place, it relocated to the newly constructed Chambers Street near its former site. The move caused the institution severe financial difficulties, which were compounded by a combination of declining funds from subscribers and increased costs from its growing student body.

In 1873, the directors turned to George Heriot&#x27;s Trust for support and agreed to a merger of the Trust&#x27;s endowment with the institution&#x27;s own. The proposed merger was provisional to changes in the structure of the Watt Institution, which would see the organisation become a technical college with representatives of the Trust in management positions. Accepting these changes, the Watt Institution officially became Heriot-Watt College in 1885 and was subsequently on far firmer financial ground.

==== The Watt Club ====
The Watt Club was founded at the Watt Institution on 12 May 1854, and is today the oldest alumni organisation in the UK. Following the unveiling of a statue of James Watt outside the institution, local jeweller J.E Vernon proposed that

&quot;[a club should be formed] whose object would be to sup together on the anniversary of the birth of James Watt…and also to promote the interests of the School, by raising a fund each year to provide prizes.&quot;

Watt Club Medals are still awarded by the organisation each year to Heriot-Watt&#x27;s most highly achieving students, while the Watt Club Prize is awarded by The Watt Club Council to recognise student initiative and enterprise.

=== Heriot-Watt College ===
After the establishment of Heriot-Watt as a technical college, the new management committee set about extending the institution&#x27;s buildings and strengthening its academic reputation. In its new form the college was one of only three non-university institutions in the UK with the power to appoint professors, and the first of these was appointed in 1887. In 1902 the college became a central institution, while in 1904 it introduced awards for graduating students which were similar to university degrees.

Expansion meant that the college made increasing demands on George Heriot&#x27;s Trust throughout the first part of the 20th century, which ultimately led to the independence of the two bodies in 1927. While the Trust continued to pay Heriot-Watt a fixed sum each year, from then on the college was responsible for managing its own financial affairs. Heriot-Watt continued to expand after becoming independent, opening a new extension in 1935.

Both World Wars impacted on the speed of the college&#x27;s expansion. During World War I, student numbers dropped as young men joined the army, while teaching in engineering stalled as the department was used for the manufacture of shells and munitions. During World War II, student numbers dropped again and the electrical engineering department became involved in training the armed services in the use of radar.

After the college introduced a postgraduate award in 1951, it offered awards equivalent to university degrees and doctorates in all practical respects. Recognising this, in 1963 the Robbins Report recommended that it should be awarded university status. On 1 February 1966 the recommendation was enacted, as the institution officially became Heriot-Watt University.

=== Heriot-Watt University ===

The first personal chair was appointed in 1974.

While Heriot-Watt continued to expand in the centre of Edinburgh after attaining university status, the institution had grown big enough that relocation was felt to be desirable. In 1966 Midlothian County Council gifted the Riccarton estate north of Currie to the university, and in 1969 work began on transforming the site into a future campus. The process of relocation to Riccarton continued until 1992, with teaching and facilities divided between the new campus and the city centre until then.

The university has continued to grow after completing its move to Riccarton, constructing additional student halls, a sports centre and a postgraduate centre on the site. The institution also expanded beyond Edinburgh, merging with the Scottish College of Textiles to create a campus in the Scottish Borders in 1998, and opening a campus in Dubai in 2006 and a campus in Putrajaya, Malaysia, in 2012.

In recent years, the university&#x27;s campus in Edinburgh has benefited from major infrastructural projects worth £60 million, with another £68 million worth investment announced. These include the UK&#x27;s first purpose-built graduate centre (£6 million), Scotland&#x27;s elite Oriam Sports Performance Centre facility (£33 million), and the UK&#x27;s first FlexBIO flexible downstream bioprocessing centre (£2 million). It is also constructing a 5,000 m2 Watt Innovation Building supporting Global Research, Innovation and Discovery [GRID] to boost &#x27;creativity and ideas generation&#x27; on the university&#x27;s growing Edinburgh campus. 
The university has plans to host a major £65 million film studio and a £2.5 million academic partnership with the oil and gas firm Total.
However, in 2017 it was also announced that a major budget shortfall and the impact of Brexit would result in Heriot-Watt shedding 100 jobs by voluntary redundancies.

== Campuses ==

Heriot-Watt currently has five campuses, and also runs distance learning programmes through 53 approved learning partners to students around the world.

=== Edinburgh ===

Heriot-Watt&#x27;s main campus is located in Riccarton in South West Edinburgh on of parkland. The campus consists of: academic buildings, student residences, a postgraduate centre, shops, several library collections, childcare, healthcare, a chaplaincy, a variety of recreational and sports facilities, and a museum, as well as the Student Union&#x27;s main premises. It is also home to the Edinburgh Conference Centre and Europe&#x27;s oldest research park, Heriot-Watt University Research Park which opened in 1971. The university&#x27;s Institute of Petroleum Engineering is based at its Edinburgh campus.

=== Scottish Borders ===
Heriot-Watt&#x27;s Scottish Borders Campus in Galashiels is home to the university&#x27;s School of Textile and Design. The school began life in 1883 when the Galashiels Manufacturer&#x27;s Corporation began running classes in practical courses for its workers. The institution gradually grew both in terms of student numbers and the number of courses it offered, and it ultimately became known as the Scottish College of Textiles in 1968. In 1998 the college merged with Heriot-Watt, leading to the creation of the School of Textiles and Design in its modern form.

The school is one of the few fashion schools in the world which offers a menswear course at bachelor&#x27;s degree level, and the only school in Scotland to offer a fashion communication course. It was ranked 11th place in the UK for art and design in the 2013 Complete University Guide, produced a winner and five other finalists for the Scottish Fashion Awards Graduate of the Year in June 2012.

While the Scottish Borders Campus shares some facilities and administrative functions with Edinburgh, it is largely self-contained. As well as its own library, accommodation and catering facilities, it has its own branch of the Student Union which runs events on the site and is home to a collection of textile records and artefacts. A new £12M student village opened at the Campus in September 2012.

The entire campus is shared with Borders College, whose students make up the majority of those who study at the site.

Marillion&#x27;s 1985 song Kayleigh was inspired by an SCT student, and refers to the snow and college halls of Galashiels.

=== Dubai ===
Heriot-Watt&#x27;s Dubai campus opened in 2005. It was the first British university to set up in Dubai International Academic City.

Offering a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses similar to those found in Scotland, the campus facilitates student exchanges between Britain and the Gulf Emirates. It has facilities including a library, computer laboratory, cafes and restaurants. An expanded campus opened in the city on 3 November 2011, allowing double the number of students to study for a Heriot-Watt degree in the city.

In April 2019, Heriot-Watt&#x27;s Dubai campus was crowned &#x27;Best University&#x27; in the Middle East at the first ever Forbes Middle East Higher Education Awards.

The campus received a five-star rating for three consecutive years in 2019, 2020 and 2021 from the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA), the supreme educational quality assurance and regulatory authority of the Government of Dubai.

In 2021, the university relocated its Dubai campus to Dubai Knowledge Park. The new campus was officially opened by King Charles III on 30 November 2023, accompanied by Scotland’s First Minister, Humza Yousaf.

=== Malaysia ===

Heriot-Watt University Malaysia&#x27;s purpose-built campus opened in Putrajaya in September 2014, £35 million was invested in the Malaysian campus, which is the first &#x27;green campus&#x27; in the country. It is situated in a lakeside location of offering undergraduate as well as master&#x27;s degree.

=== Orkney ===

Heriot-Watt&#x27;s campus in Stromness, Orkney, is home to the International Centre for Island Technology (ICIT), part of the university&#x27;s School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society. The Campus provides education to a small number of postgraduate students and is host to eight members of research staff.

<text>In systems engineering, dependability is a measure of a system&#x27;s availability, reliability, maintainability, and in some cases, other characteristics such as durability, safety and security. In real-time computing, dependability is the ability to provide services that can be trusted within a time-period. The service guarantees must hold even when the system is subject to attacks or natural failures. 

The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), via its Technical Committee TC 56 develops and maintains international standards that provide systematic methods and tools for dependability assessment and management of equipment, services, and systems throughout their life cycles. The IFIP Working Group 10.4 on &quot;Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance&quot; plays a role in synthesizing the technical community&#x27;s progress in the field and organizes two workshops each year to disseminate the results. 

Dependability can be broken down into three elements:
* Attributes - a way to assess the dependability of a system
* Threats - an understanding of the things that can affect the dependability of a system
* Means - ways to increase a system&#x27;s dependability

== History ==
Some sources hold that word was coined in the nineteen-teens in Dodge Brothers automobile print advertising. But the word predates that period, with the Oxford English Dictionary finding its first use in 1901.

As interest in fault tolerance and system reliability increased in the 1960s and 1970s, dependability came to be a measure of [x] as measures of reliability came to encompass additional measures like safety and integrity. In the early 1980s, Jean-Claude Laprie thus chose &quot;dependability&quot; as the term to encompass studies of fault tolerance and system reliability without the extension of meaning inherent in &quot;reliability&quot;.

The field of dependability has evolved from these beginnings to be an internationally active field of research fostered by a number of prominent international conferences, notably the International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks, the International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems and the International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering.

Traditionally, dependability for a system incorporates availability, reliability, maintainability but since the 1980s, safety and security have been added to measures of dependability.

== Elements of dependability ==
=== Attributes ===

Attributes are qualities of a system. These can be assessed to determine its overall dependability using Qualitative or Quantitative measures. Avizienis et al. define the following Dependability Attributes:

* Availability - readiness for correct service
* Reliability - continuity of correct service
* Safety - absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the environment
* Integrity - absence of improper system alteration
* Maintainability - ability for easy maintenance (repair)

As these definitions suggested, only Availability and Reliability are quantifiable by direct measurements whilst others are more subjective. For instance Safety cannot be measured directly via metrics but is a subjective assessment that requires judgmental information to be applied to give a level of confidence, whilst Reliability can be measured as failures over time.

Confidentiality, i.e. &quot;the absence of unauthorized disclosure of information&quot; is also used when addressing security. Security is a composite of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Security is sometimes classed as an attribute but the current view is to aggregate it together with dependability and treat Dependability as a composite term called Dependability and Security.

Practically, applying security measures to the appliances of a system generally improves the dependability by limiting the number of externally originated errors.

=== Threats ===

Threats are things that can affect a system and cause a drop in Dependability. There are three main terms that must be clearly understood: 

* Fault: A fault (which is usually referred to as a bug for historic reasons) is a defect in a system. The presence of a fault in a system may or may not lead to a failure. For instance, although a system may contain a fault, its input and state conditions may never cause this fault to be executed so that an error occurs; and thus that particular fault never exhibits as a failure.
* Error: An error is a discrepancy between the intended behavior of a system and its actual behavior inside the system boundary. Errors occur at runtime when some part of the system enters an unexpected state due to the activation of a fault. Since errors are generated from invalid states they are hard to observe without special mechanisms, such as debuggers or debug output to logs.
* Failure: A failure is an instance in time when a system displays behavior that is contrary to its specification. An error may not necessarily cause a failure, for instance an exception may be thrown by a system but this may be caught and handled using fault tolerance techniques so the overall operation of the system will conform to the specification.

It is important to note that Failures are recorded at the system boundary. They are basically Errors that have propagated to the system boundary and have become observable.
Faults, Errors and Failures operate according to a mechanism. This mechanism is sometimes known as a Fault-Error-Failure chain. As a general rule a fault, when activated, can lead to an error (which is an invalid state) and the invalid state generated by an error may lead to another error or a failure (which is an observable deviation from the specified behavior at the system boundary).

Once a fault is activated an error is created. An error may act in the same way as a fault in that it can create further error conditions, therefore an error may propagate multiple times within a system boundary without causing an observable failure. If an error propagates outside the system boundary a failure is said to occur. A failure is basically the point at which it can be said that a service is failing to meet its specification. Since the output data from one service may be fed into another, a failure in one service may propagate into another service as a fault so a chain can be formed of the form: Fault leading to Error leading to Failure leading to Error, etc.

=== Means ===

Since the mechanism of a Fault-Error-Chain is understood it is possible to construct means to break these chains and thereby increase the dependability of a system.
Four means have been identified so far:
# Prevention
# Removal
# Forecasting
# Tolerance

Fault Prevention deals with preventing faults being introduced into a system. This can be accomplished by use of development methodologies and good implementation techniques.

Fault Removal can be sub-divided into two sub-categories: Removal During Development and Removal During Use.&lt;br&gt;
Removal during development requires verification so that faults can be detected and removed before a system is put into production. Once systems have been put into production a system is needed to record failures and remove them via a maintenance cycle.

Fault Forecasting predicts likely faults so that they can be removed or their effects can be circumvented.

Fault Tolerance deals with putting mechanisms in place that will allow a system to still deliver the required service in the presence of faults, although that service may be at a degraded level.

Dependability means are intended to reduce the number of failures made visible to the end users of a system. 

=== Persistence ===

Based on how faults appear or persist, they are classified as:

* Transient: They appear without apparent cause and disappear again without apparent cause
* Intermittent: They appear multiple times, possibly without a discernible pattern, and disappear on their own
* Permanent: Once they appear, they do not get resolved on their own

== Dependability of information systems and survivability ==

Some works on dependability use structured information systems, e.g. with SOA, to introduce the attribute survivability, thus taking into account the degraded services that an Information System sustains or resumes after a non-maskable failure.

The flexibility of current frameworks encourage system architects to enable reconfiguration mechanisms that refocus the available, safe resources to support the most critical services rather than over-provisioning to build failure-proof system.

With the generalisation of networked information systems, accessibility was introduced to give greater importance to users&#x27; experience.

To take into account the level of performance, the measurement of performability is defined as &quot;quantifying how well the object system performs in the presence of faults over a specified period of time&quot;.

<text>Fairford is a market town in Gloucestershire, England. The town lies in the Cotswold hills on the River Coln, east of Cirencester, west of Lechlade and north of Swindon. Nearby are RAF Fairford and the Cotswold Water Park.

==History==

=== Iron Ages ===
There was a major roundhouse settlement in Horcott (on the south side of the town), and the Welsh Way, which passed through Fairford, was used during this period as a trade route.

=== Middle Ages ===
Evidence of settlement in Fairford dates back to the 9th century and it received a royal market grant in the 12th century. An estate in Fairford, which seemingly belonging to Gloucester Abbey, was bequeathed to Burgred of Mercia in the mid 9th century. At the time of the Norman conquest, Brictric, a large landowner in the West Country, held a manor in Fairford. Matilda of Flanders came to own the land which became property of the Crown. In 1100, Robert Fitzhamon, the first Norman feudal baron of Gloucester, is recorded as owning the land which would be passed down to subsequent barons of Gloucester for the next 200 years, along with the manor of Tewkesbury.

In the Domesday Book, Fairford was listed as &quot;Fareforde.&quot; In 1066 there were three mills in the town, one of which was still used in the wool trade by the 13th century. The mill that survives today was built in the 17th century.

Both Edward I and Henry VIII were royal visitors to the town in 1276 and 1520 respectively.

Fairford is recorded as having a prison in 1248. Hundred courts were held by the lord of the manor and borough.

By the 15th century the land of Fairford was managed by wool merchants John Twynyho and John Tame after George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence was forced to give up his lands after being tried for treason.

=== 17th and 18th century ===
In 1608, the inhabitants of Fairford were mostly agricultural labourers or artisans.

Fairford Park, to the north of the town, was made part of the manor house grounds, built by Andrew Barker in the 1660s. It would later be turned into a deer park by James Lambe, with an obelisk built to mark the edge of the grounds. The park remained in the Barker family until it was sold to Earnest Cook in 1945.

In 1755, seven innkeepers were licensed in Fairford. The first recording of an inn had been in 1419 and this grew over the centuries owing to Fairford&#x27;s location as a connecting town between larger metropolitan areas. Stagecoach routes often called at Fairford before travelling on to Gloucester, Cirencester, Bristol, Oxford and London. 
=== 19th and 20th century ===
The first outbreak of the 1830-1831 Swing Riots withinin Gloucestershire, happened in Fairford on 26th November 1830. Farming machinery which was being manufactured in the town was destroyed by protestors who then joined forces with those from the surrounding villages of Quenington, Hatherop, Coln and Southrop. 

By this time there were pounds in the town as well as a village lock-up that had been around since at least 1809.

RAF Fairford was constructed in 1944 as a joint British and American base. 

From 1947 to 1959, Fairford housed 1,200 Poles in The Displaced Persons Camp who had been displaced due to the Second World War. The site had originally been an American Air Force hospital that was built during the war. The buildings were then repurposed for the camp before being demolished in 1977.

=== 21st century ===

==== Iraq War ====

In March 2003 &#x27;Flowers to Fairford&#x27; was held as a protest against the use of RAF Fairford as the base for the 14 B-52 bombers aircraft which were used to bomb Iraq as part of Operation Desert Storm. Several thousand people attended and there was a large police presence, but the event passed off peacefully. A coach load of people intending to protest was stopped in Lechlade under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 and searched by police and sent back to London. Ninety of the detained demonstrators formed Fairford Coach Action and sought legal recourse against Gloucestershire constabulary. The group stated that:&quot;On 22 March 2003, the police used surprisingly extreme tactics to prevent more than 120 activists from reaching [the] legally sanctioned anti-war demonstration in Fairford, (Gloucestershire, UK). The demonstration outside a US Airforce Base in Fairford was well attended with estimates of up to 5,000 activists attending. Among the scheduled speakers on the day were writer George Monbiot and Caroline Lucas (MEP). The people who police prevented from attending were a diverse group with a broad range of affiliations. The main thing that they had in common was the desire to travel from London by coach and the intention of joining the legal protest in Fairford. Two of the four main scheduled speakers for the Fairford demonstration were travelling on these coaches from London. After the coaches had travelled two and a half hours from London, the coaches were stopped by police just miles from the demonstration. Using section 60 powers (of the Public Order and Criminal Justice Act 1994) police searched the coaches for weapons for one and a half hours. The passengers cooperated with this search, and they were invited to reboard the coaches when the search concluded. No arrests were made and no items found. After all the passengers boarded, the coaches were escorted immediately back to London under a continuous 9–12 vehicle police escort.&quot;In 2013, after appeal, Gloucestershire police&#x27;s actions were found to be unlawful, and included breaching &quot;protesters&#x27; rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly.&quot; Some of the demonstrators involved were awarded upwards of £4,000 in compensation by a judge after taking their claim to court.

==== Flooding ====
In July 2007 Fairford suffered unseasonably high rainfall which led to major flooding of 64 homes on Milton Street and London Street as well as in some other surrounding areas. This meant that many of the annual events had to be cancelled.

==== Archaeological find ====
In 2013, a female skeleton was found in the River Coln and was later discovered to be of Sub-Saharan origin. The remains were estimated to be around 1000 years old and it is thought that the woman was around 18-24 when she died.

==Churches==

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary is renowned for its complete set of medieval stained glass, stone carvings and misericords. Rebuilt in the early 1490s by the wool merchant John Tame (d.1500), the church is an example of late Perpendicular Gothic architecture that is characterised by slim stone window mullions and light but strong buttresses. The style enabled larger windows than previously, allowing much more light into the building. Grade 1 listed by English Heritage, its structure and details remains unaltered since built.

====Stained glass, St Mary&#x27;s Church====
St. Mary&#x27;s is of national historical and architectural importance because it houses the most complete set of mediaeval stained glass windows in the country, attributed to Barnard Flower. The glass survived the Reformation when many images in English churches were destroyed. In 1642, during the Civil War, they narrowly avoided destruction when the Roundhead army was marching on the nearby town of Cirencester.

Some of the panes were damaged during a storm in November 1703 and those were repaired and modified or replaced. A conservation and restoration programme began in 1988 and finished in 2010. Clear glass now protects the old glass.

====Churchyard, St Mary&#x27;s Church====
The churchyard includes a stone memorial to Tiddles, the church cat who fell off the church roof. There is also a stone grotesque to commemorate a young boy who climbed up the walls of the church and jumped, falling to his death. The churchyard contains eight Commonwealth war graves; three British Army soldiers, a Royal Navy seaman and a Royal Air Force airman of World War I and two British soldiers and a Home Guardsman of World War II.

===St Thomas&#x27; of Canterbury===
Fairford has a 19th-century Catholic church of St Thomas of Canterbury. Following the closure of the recusant chapel at Hatherop Castle in 1844, a church was built at Horcott the following year at a cost of £700. The first Mass was celebrated in 1845, five years before the Restoration of the Hierarchy in England and before the creation of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton. The stained glass window behind the altar depicts St. Thomas of Canterbury in the centre panel, showing the date 1845. The adjoining Presbytery was built 20 years later to designs by Benjamin Bucknall, the architect of Woodchester Mansion. The church contains an organ by Hill and stained glass by William Wailes, Hardman and Geoffrey Robinson. The two windows in the porch were added to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the first Mass. The left window depicts the crest of the de Mauley family; that on the right depicts the Eucharist.

===Fairford United Church===
In 1981 a group of local Methodists approached the local Congregational Church to use the chapel for their services as there was no Methodist Church in Fairford. They were officially united into one congregation in 1986 and the present church follows the traditions of both the Methodist Church and the Congregational Federation.

The churches in and around Fairford are represented by the organisation Churches Together Around Fairford (CTAF) which has meetings and organises services of unity.

== Governance ==
Fairford was part of the Cirencester Rural District until the Local Government Act 1972, when it became part of the Cotswold District. 

Fairford is in a civil parish and has a Town Council with 13 members. The mayor is James Nicholls.

After a boundary review implemented for the 2015 local elections, Fairford was split into two District Council electoral wards called Fairford North Ward (single member) and Lechlade, Kempsford and Fairford South Ward (two member). On Cotswold District Council Fairford North Ward is represented by Liberal Democrat Andrew Doherty and Lechlade, Kempsford and Fairford South Ward is as of May 2023 represented by Liberal Democrats Councillors Clare Muir and Helene Mansilla.

As of 2021, the town is represented on Gloucestershire County Council by Conservative Councillor Dom Morris who represents the Fairford and Lechlade on Thames Division.

The ward population at the 2011 census was 4,031.

==Education==
The town&#x27;s secondary school is Farmor&#x27;s School, an 11-18 co-educational academy. The school was judged to be of outstanding standard, having achieved Grade 1 in its Ofsted inspection in 2010. After becoming an academy it achieved lower grades from the board over the years: &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Requires Improvement&quot; and &quot;Good&quot; again in 2013, 2017 and 2021 respectively.

There is also a primary school (Fairford Primary), and a playgroup. Coln House School was a 9-16, residential/day, state special school. After being put into special measures following a 2016 Ofsted report, the school closed in March 2017. Built in 1822 by Alexander Iles as a private asylum called The Retreat, it closed in 1944 before becoming a school in 1949.

==Transport==
Fairford was formerly linked to Oxford by the Witney Railway and its extension the East Gloucestershire Railway. The route was active between 1873 and 1962. There have been reports that part of the old track could be cleared of accumulated mountains of detritus and overgrown trees to be re-opened as a cycle path. There is a bus service to Cirencester and Lechlade, from where travellers can transfer to another bus and travel onwards to Swindon.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford TV transmitter. 

The town is served by both BBC Radio Wiltshire and BBC Radio Gloucestershire. Other radio stations including Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, Cotswolds Radio, community based radio station and Air Tattoo Live, a RSL station which broadcast coverage during the Royal International Air Tattoo. 

Fairford is served by the weekly local newspaper, Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard. 

==Events==

=== Air Tattoo ===
For three days every year RAF Fairford hosts one of the world&#x27;s largest military air shows – the Royal International Air Tattoo. The event usually takes place in July and brings a boost to the economy of the town and surrounding areas.

=== Ploughing Championship ===
The Fairford, Faringdon, Filkins and Burford Championship and Country Show held every year since 1948.

=== Steam Rally ===
The Ernest Cook Trust used to host the annual Fairford Steam Rally and Show. The Show closed in 2015 after running for 46 years.

==Sport and leisure==

Fairford has a non-league football team Fairford Town F.C. who play and train at Cinder Lane. Fairford have their own rugby team FRFC, playing in green and black strip. Fairford also has a women&#x27;s netball team, competing in the nearby Swindon league. The town also has the Walnut Tree Field: a large playing field and park, a cricket club (dating back to the early 1900s), a bowling, sailing and water skiing club. Fairford had a leisure centre until 2019 which had been managed by Farmor&#x27;s School since 2013.

Fairford also has a youth football club, based at Horcott Road which caters for children between the ages of 5 and 15 years old. The club, established in 1976, is a FA Chartered Club, run by volunteers for the benefit of local children from Fairford and surrounding villages. Teams from U8 and above play in the North Wiltshire Youth Football Leagues.

==Literature==
&quot;The Secret Diary of Sarah Thomas, 1860 – 1865&quot;, is a published journal by a Victorian diarist living in Fairford. It features local landmarks.

<text>Karl Robert Reichsgraf von Nesselrode-Ehreshoven, also known as Charles de Nesselrode (; 14 December 1780 – 23 March 1862), was a Russian diplomat of German noble descent. For 40 years (1816–1856), Nesselrode guided Russian policy as foreign minister. He was also a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance.

== Early life ==
Karl was born at sea
near Lisbon, Portugal into the prominent Uradel German House of Nesselrode, which originated in the Bergisches Land near the Rhine. His father Count Wilhelm Karl von Nesselrode (1724–1810), a Count of the Holy Roman Empire, served at the time as the ambassador to Portugal for the German-born Russian empress. His mother was Louise Gontard (1746–1785), whose family belonged to Huguenot noble families from Dauphiné that fled from France to Germany in 1700. In deference to his mother&#x27;s Protestantism he was baptized in the chapel of the British Embassy, thus becoming a member of the Church of England.

== Biography ==
After his father became the Russian ambassador to the Prussian court about 1787, Nesselrode&#x27;s education in a Berlin gymnasium reinforced his Germanic roots. Even though Nesselrode would work for the Russians for the next few decades of his life, he could neither read nor write Russian and spoke it only brokenly.

In 1788, at the age of 8, he officially entered the Imperial Russian Navy. With his father&#x27;s influence, he secured the position of naval &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Emperor Paul ().

He then transferred to the Imperial Russian Army, and entered diplomatic service under Paul I&#x27;s son and successor, Emperor Alexander I. He was attached to the Russian embassy at Berlin, and transferred thence to The Hague.

In August 1806 Nesselrode received a commission to travel in southern Germany to report on the French troops there; he was then attached as diplomatic secretary to General Mikhail Kamensky, and then to (ethnic German) generals Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden and Levin August von Bennigsen in succession.

He was present at the inconclusive Battle of Eylau in January 1807, fought by Count von Bennigsen, and assisted at the negotiations of the Peace of Tilsit (July 1807), for which he was commended by Spanish Bonapartist Diego Fernandez de Velasco, 13th Duke of Frías (who in 1811 would die in exile in Paris). During negotiations he was seated at the table with Napoleon I.

Following the Congress of Erfurt in 1808, Nesselrode was secretly accredited by Alexander to serve as his unofficial channel of information between himself and Talleyrand and the marquis de Caulaincourt, formerly ambassador in St Petersburg, both of whom were hostile to Napoleon&#x27;s policy of aggression. After the breach of diplomatic relations with Russia in 1811, Nesselrode returned to St Petersburg by way of Vienna in order to exchange views with Metternich. He sought to persuade Alexander to open negotiations with Napoleon, if only to throw the onus of breaking the peace entirely on the French side. He joined the tsar&#x27;s headquarters at Vilna in March 1812 and, though Rumiantzov was still foreign minister, it was Nesselrode who directed the foreign policy of Russia from this time forward.

Nesselrode was present at the battle of Leipzig and accompanied the invading army to Paris; he negotiated the capitulation of Auguste de Marmont and Édouard Mortier at Clichy, and signed the Treaty of Chaumont on 1 March 1814. His former relations with Talleyrand facilitated negotiations in Paris, and his influence with the emperor was used in favour of the restoration of the Bourbons, and, after the Battle of Waterloo, against the imposition of a ruinous war indemnity on France.

Nesselrode became State Secretary in 1814 and was the head of Russia&#x27;s official delegation to the Congress of Vienna, but for the most part Alexander I acted as his own foreign minister. In 1816, Nesselrode became Russian foreign minister, sharing the position with Count Ioannis Kapodistrias until the latter&#x27;s retirement in 1822.

For forty years, Nesselrode guided Russian policy and was a leading European conservative statesman of the Holy Alliance. He was a key contributor in the construction of the peaceable congress system after the Napoleonic Wars. Between 1845 and 1856, he served as Chancellor of the Russian Empire. As Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1824, he was a plenipotentiary during negotiations with the United States in defining the boundary between Russian America and the American claims known as the Oregon Country, which were resolved with the Russo-American Treaty of 1824, and a parallel treaty with Britain concerning British claims which overlapped with those of the U.S. A century later in 1924, Mount Nesselrode in the Boundary Ranges of the Alaska-British Columbia boundary was named for him.

Nesselrode is credited as the person who first coined the name &quot;Tournament of Shadows&quot;, which was the Russian name for the long rivalry that existed between the Russian Empire and the British Empire beginning in the late 18th and lasting well into the 19th centuries, caused primarily by border tension in Central Asia and India.

In 1849 Nesselrode sent Russian troops to aid Austria in putting down the Hungarian Revolution led by Lajos Kossuth.

One frequently-overlooked facet of Nesselrode&#x27;s activity involved his attempts to penetrate Japan&#x27;s self-isolation. In 1853 he dispatched Yevfimiy Putyatin with a letter to the &quot;shōgun&quot;; Putyatin returned to Saint Petersburg with the favorable Treaty of Shimoda (signed 1855).

Nesselrode&#x27;s efforts to expand Russia&#x27;s influence in the Balkans and Mediterranean led to conflicts with the Ottoman Empire, Britain, France, and the Kingdom of Sardinia, which all became allies opposing Russia in the Crimean War (1853–1856). Britain and France, unhappy with Russia&#x27;s growing influence, determined to support Turkey and so restrict Russia.

Nesselrode&#x27;s autobiography was published posthumously in 1866.

<doc id="661390" wikidata="Q274754" url="?curid=661390" title="Élivágar">
<text>In Norse mythology, Élivágar (Old Norse: ; &quot;Ice Waves&quot;) are rivers that existed in Ginnungagap at the beginning of the world. The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; relates:

The streams called Ice-waves, those which were so long come from the fountain-heads that the yeasty atter upon them had hardened like the slag that runs out of the fire,-these then became ice; and when the ice halted and ceased to run, then it froze over above. But the drizzling rain that rose from the venom congealed to rime, and the rime increased, frost over frost, each over the other, even into Ginnungagap, the Yawning Void. &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; 5.

The eleven rivers traditionally associated with the Élivágar include the Svöl, Gunnþrá, Fjörm, Fimbulþul, Slíðr, Hríð, Sylgr, Ylgr, Við, Leiptr and Gjöll (which flows closest to the gate of Hel and is spanned by the bridge Gjallarbrú), although many other additional rivers are mentioned by name in both Eddas.

The rivers seem to act as borders between differing lands whether between the gods and the giants or between the mythological world and mortal world.

The Élivágar also figure in the origin of Ymir, the first giant. According to &quot;Vafthrúdnismál&quot;, Ymir was formed from the poison that dripped from the rivers.

In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Snorri expands upon this notion considerably. As quoted above, when the venomous yeast from the Élivágar froze to ice and overspread its banks it fell as rain through the mild air of Ginnungagap. The rime, infused with the cold of Niflheim from which the Élivágar find their source in the wellspring Hvergelmir, began to fill the void. It then combined with the life-giving fire and heat of Muspelheim, melting and dripping and giving form to Ymir, progenitor of the rime giants or frost giants.

Elsewhere, &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; says that, &quot;So many serpents are in Hvergelmir with Nídhögg that no tongue can tell them.&quot; These serpents are presumably the source of the venom or poison referred to in the myth.

A reference to the river Leiptr appears in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;, where the Valkyrie Sigrún puts a curse on her brother Dagr for having murdered her husband Helgi Hundingsbane despite him having sworn a holy oath of allegiance to Helgi on the &quot;bright water of Leiptr&quot; (&quot;ljósa Leiftrar vatni&quot;):

<text>In Norse mythology, the Vimur is the largest of the Elivagar rivers that were formed at the beginning of the world.

In Skáldskaparmál 18, part of the Norse Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, the Vimur river is mentioned in the tale of Thor and Geirrod. Thor needed to cross the Vimur on his way to Geirrod&#x27;s abode. The force of the river threatened to sweep Thor away. Geirrod&#x27;s daughter, Gjalp, tried to drown them by urinating in the river and causing it to rapidly overflow. Thor hurled a rock into the river, effectively stopping the flow. This, together with the help of a rowan tree, allowed Thor to cross the river.

<doc id="661397" wikidata="Q6313551" url="?curid=661397" title="Junior school">
<text>A junior school is a type of school which provides primary education to children, often in the age range from 8 and 13, following attendance at an infant school, which covers the age range 5–7. Since both infant and junior schools provide primary education, pupils are commonly placed in a unified building – a primary school.

==Australia==
In Australia, a junior school is usually a part of a private school that educates children between the ages of 2 and 5. 

In South Australia a junior primary school, it is where a child will begin their education, usually in or before the year level preceding Year 1. Depending on the school, a child will move to the main primary school between the ages of 3 in 8

In most primary schools, the junior primary is located within the same buildings and grounds as the primary school, although some junior schools are located on an adjacent or separate site.

==Canada==
In Canada, mostly in Toronto, the term junior school is used by the former Etobicoke Board of Education to refer to public schools from kindergarten to grade 5. Most of the schools in the former Scarborough Board of Education and the Toronto Board of Education use the term junior public school for schools from kindergarten to grade 6.

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom a junior school is usually a small school serving a particular locality, and is also used by independent schools to refer to the nursery and primary school services they offer. 

A junior school forms part of the local pattern of provision for primary education. Most junior schools cater for pupils moving from infant schools from the September following their seventh birthday, after they have taken their Key stage 1 SATs. Pupils join in Year 3, and stay at the school for four years, leaving at the end of Year 6 when most pupils are aged 11. These four years form Key Stage 2 in the English education system. At the end of this time, most pupils will move to a secondary school.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, a significant number of junior schools were abolished in favour of 9-14 middle schools, and while some of these remain open today the majority of them have been abolished in favour of a return to traditional 7–11 junior schools.

In some London boroughs, a JMI is a &quot;junior mixed infant school&quot; which caters to children aged 4 to 11. Some have been renamed to the more common &quot;primary school&quot;.

<text>Robyn Regehr (born April 19, 1980) is a Brazilian-born Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He was a first-round draft pick of the Colorado Avalanche, selected 19th overall at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, but was traded to the Calgary Flames prior to the start of his professional career, and has also played for the Buffalo Sabres in an NHL career that has spanned 1,089 games. Regehr won his first Stanley Cup in 2014 with the Kings, his 15th year in the NHL. He was a member of the Canadian team at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and has won silver medals at the World Junior and Senior championships, as well as the championship at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.

Regehr was born in Brazil and spent his early childhood in Indonesia before his parents settled back in Canada. At 19, he was the youngest nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy in NHL history after he made his debut less than four months after suffering two broken legs in a serious automobile accident. He is best known for his strong defence and physical ability. His younger brother Richie briefly played with him on the Flames. Regehr announced his retirement from the NHL on April 11, 2015.

==Early life==
Regehr was born in Recife, Brazil, the second son of Canadian Mennonite missionaries Ron and Edith Regehr. Regehr only lived in Brazil for the first nine months of his life. From three to seven years old he lived in Indonesia, where his younger brother, Richie was born. He also has an older brother and a sister. The family finally settled back in Canada, at Rosthern, Saskatchewan around the time he turned seven. Regehr quickly picked up the game of hockey, but was held back in his first year of minor hockey as he was starting the game three years behind other kids his age. He helped his father operate the natural surface ice rink in Rosthern, often spending hours manually preparing the ice.

Despite being born in Brazil, Regehr cannot speak Portuguese and has very few connections with the country. He declared himself a fan of football and the Brazilian soccer team, and has expressed interest in returning to visit his country of birth.

==Playing career==

===Junior===
The Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League (WHL) selected Regehr with their first pick, 17th overall, in the 1995 WHL Bantam Draft. He played as a 15-year-old with the Prince Albert Mintos of the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League where he was named the team&#x27;s top defenceman. He then joined the Blazers for the 1996–97 WHL season. Two years later, the Colorado Avalanche drafted him in the first round, 19th overall, at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. Regehr broke out following the draft, scoring 12 goals and 32 points in 1998–99, and helped the Blazers reach the WHL championship where they lost to the Calgary Hitmen. He was named a Western Conference All-Star by the WHL and a third-team All-Star by the Canadian Hockey League, and represented Canada at the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, winning a silver medal.

Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, along with Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and their choice of a prospect from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured in an automobile accident near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into his path. He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.

===National Hockey League===

====Calgary Flames====
Following operations to repair the damage to Regehr&#x27;s legs, doctors gained optimism, but expected he would be unable to skate before the end of the year.
He far exceeded doctors&#x27; expectations; he was skating by the beginning of September and was back playing hockey less than four months following the accident. He played a five-game conditioning stint with the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League in late October before being recalled by the Flames on October 28, 1999. That night, he made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators and was praised by his coach, Brian Sutter, for playing a mistake free game. He scored his first NHL goal on November 10 against the San Jose Sharks. Regehr played 57 games for the Flames in 1999–2000, scoring five goals and 12 points. He was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. At the age of 19, he was the youngest nominee in NHL history. The Flames also presented him with the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in honor of his perseverance.

Regehr struggled in 2001–02, finishing with a team worst −24 plus/minus while occasionally being left out of the lineup as a healthy scratch. Unhappy with his season, he focused on improving his game. He overcame rib, abdominal and wrist injuries in 2002–03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication. The Flames rewarded him with a five-year contract extension prior to the 2003–04 season. They also named him an alternate captain, a position he continuously held for the remainder of his stay in Calgary.

Not known for his offensive ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought early in the season, finishing with four for the season. He set a career high with 18 points, and was a key player in the Flames improbable run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals facing top opposition players. He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Finals despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five. His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents.
While the 2004–05 season was cancelled due to a labor dispute, Regehr played in a European charity tour that saw NHL players form a &quot;Worldstars&quot; team that played ten games in seven countries in December 2004. While he enjoyed the tour, Regehr stated that he was not interested in joining the many other NHL players who signed on with European teams during the lockout. He was also critical of the position of the league in the lockout, and took on a greater role within the National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA) when he succeeded Jarome Iginla as the Flames player representative following the lockout.

While the NHL returned to action in 2005–06, he missed the first month of the season after suffering a knee injury in a pre-season game. Doctors considered Regehr fortunate, believing that a knee brace he had been wearing prevented a more severe injury that would have seen him miss up to six months. Despite missing 14 games, he set career highs in goals (6), assists (20) and points (26). He continued to quietly lead the Flames defence and earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006. Regehr briefly played with his brother, Richie, who made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 29, 2005. He played the full season in 2006–07, including his 500th career game on March 15, 2007, against the Dallas Stars and scored his 100th career point on March 31 against the Vancouver Canucks. However, he was again forced out of the lineup due to a knee injury after only one game in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr to another five-year contract extension worth a total of US$20-million. The deal was considered to be worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.

Off the ice, Regehr was named to an NHLPA committee formed in 2007 to find a replacement for ousted Executive Director Ted Saskin. The union hired Paul Kelly in October 2007, however he was controversially dismissed less than two years later. Regehr defended the firing, though he and all player representatives were criticized for how they handled Kelly&#x27;s dismissal.

Another knee injury ended his 2008–09 season after 75 games and left him unavailable for the playoffs. He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan, who was fired by the team after failing to advance past the first round of the playoffs, criticizing Keenan&#x27;s lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team&#x27;s chances under a new coach. After failing to score a goal in 2008–09 and the first half of the 2009–10 season, Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18, 2010, against the San Jose Sharks. He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010–11. Upon playing his 804th game late in the season, Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team&#x27;s all-time leader in games played by a defenceman.

====Buffalo and Los Angeles====

After missing the playoffs in the two previous seasons and needing to clear salary cap space to sign Alex Tanguay, the Flames dealt Regehr to the Buffalo Sabres on June 25, 2011. He was sent to Buffalo, along with Aleš Kotalík and a second round selection at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Paul Byron and Chris Butler. According to Flames&#x27; general manager Jay Feaster, the deal &quot;surprised&quot; Regehr, who initially was unsure he would waive his no-trade clause and agree to the deal. Regehr accepted the deal after speaking with Sabres&#x27; management.

In his first season with Buffalo, 2011–12, Regehr led the Sabres with 172 hits and finished second with 112 blocked shots. His one-goal on the season ended another lengthy scoring drought that lasted nearly 11 months. His tenure with the Sabres ended 21 games into the 2012–13 season. In the final year of his contract and with Buffalo out of playoff contention, he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings on April 1, 2013, in exchange for two second round draft picks. The Kings acquired Regehr to add a veteran presence and aid the team&#x27;s penalty kill. He appeared in 41 games during the season, split between the two teams, and recorded four assists. Shortly after the Kings reached the third round of the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Regehr and the team agreed to a two-year, $6 million contract extension. After the Kings were eliminated from the post-season by the Chicago Blackhawks, Kings&#x27; coach Darryl Sutter revealed he had played the entire playoffs with an elbow injury that required off-season surgery to repair.

In the 2013–14 season, Regehr begun his 15th year in the NHL, and played his 1,000th game on February 1, 2014, against the Philadelphia Flyers. At the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Regher only played the first round against the San Jose Sharks before being sidelined with a knee injury. Once the Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals, captain Dustin Brown finished his victory lap by handing the Stanley Cup to Regehr, thanking the veteran for his off-ice presence.

Following the last regular season game for the Kings and the last day of the 2014–15 regular season, Regehr announced that he would retire from professional hockey.

==International play==



Regehr joined the Canadian junior team for the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, playing all seven games for the silver medal winning Canadians. He made his first appearance with the senior team following his rookie season in the NHL, playing six games in the 2000 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships. His emergence in the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs earned him consideration for Canada&#x27;s entry at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. He was named to the team by executive director Wayne Gretzky as he looked to bring a younger team to this tournament than played at the 2002 Winter Olympics. The decision worked, as Regehr and the Canadians won the championship.

He played in his second world championship in 2005, where he won a silver medal after Canada lost the final to the Czech Republic 3–0. The following year, he was named to the Canadian Olympic team for the 2006 Winter Olympics. He recorded one assist in six games, though Canada was unable to defend its 2002 gold medal, failing to medal entirely. Regehr participated in team Canada&#x27;s orientation camp for the 2010 Games in the hopes of earning a second opportunity to win an Olympic medal.

==Personal life==
Regehr married his wife Kristina in late 2007, and the couple have two sons. While in Calgary, they were active in the community, serving as honorary co-chairs of the Impact Foundation, an organization that aims to help kids deal with the challenges of growing up. Regehr donated $75 to the organization for every bodycheck he was credited with during the NHL season. He is also active with Right to Play, an athlete driven organization that aims to improve the lives of the world&#x27;s most impoverished children through sport. He made a trip to Mozambique in the summer of 2008 as an ambassador to the organization, and has participated in charity events for the organization. The Flames named him the inaugural recipient of the J. R. &quot;Bud&quot; McCaig Award in 2006 in honor of his contributions to society. He is an avid outdoorsman; his favorite winter activity is snowmobiling. He favours wakeboarding in the summer, and has spent time teaching kids outdoor safety.

<doc id="661414" wikidata="Q6993421" url="?curid=661414" title="Neon Hunk">
<text>Neon Hunk was a husband and wife noise music duo from Milwaukee. The duo went under pseudonyms; Mothmaster (responsible for vocals and synthesizers) and Mossmaster (responsible for drums, vocals and additional synthesizer work). The duo formed in the summer of 2000 under the name &quot;Abracadaver&quot;, but changed their name to &quot;Neon Hunk&quot; in 2001. &quot;Neon Hunk&quot; disbanded in 2004, with both members of the duo continuing to record music independently.

== Music ==
The music of &quot;Neon Hunk&quot; featured sparse, drum and synthesizer arrangements, generally non-tonal, and often in non-standard and frequently changing time signatures. Vocals within their songs were typically processed with a vocoder. Their sound combined aspects of progressive and experimental rock, punk, avant-garde electronic/noise music, as well as free-improvisation at times. The music is held together with a quirky, cartoonish pop sensibility. Typical &quot;Neon Hunk&quot; songs rarely exceeded two minutes, though live shows sometimes featured longer improvised jam-sessions (shown on their releases &quot;Neyan Honkies&quot; and the tour only release, &quot;SECRETS OF THE HUNK&quot;).

== Influences ==
&quot;Neon Hunk&quot; cited diverse influences including Black Sabbath, Melvins, Ruins, Rush, Blue Cheer, early Devo, and Kraftwerk. They also cited musical contemporaries such as many of their Load Records peers and many other artists within the underground noise and punk community. The duo was known for their lively high energy shows, disjointed dance moves, and scrapped-together, bright, home-modified masks and costumes.

== Other activity ==
&quot;Neon Hunk&quot; toured the US and Canada several times in summers and winters from 2001 to 2003 including partial or whole tours with Hair Police, Mammal, Wolf Eyes, The Locust, Chinese Stars, Kites, and Black Coitus Family. The duo&#x27;s final performance was in 2004 at the De Stijl festival in Minneapolis, MN alongside The Dream Aktion Unit, Devendra Banhart, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice and Dead Machines.

Since the dissolution of &quot;Neon Hunk&quot;, Mossmaster and Mothmaster have continued recording music under various names. Mossmaster has self-released several solo CDr&#x27;s.

== Discography ==

<text>The Tano or Tanoé River (French: &quot;Rivière Tano&quot;) is a river in Ghana. It flows for 400 kilometres from a town called Traa, a suburb of Techiman, the capital town of Bono East Region of the Republic of Ghana to Ehy Lagoon, Tendo Lagoon and finally Aby Lagoon in Ivory Coast where it enters the Atlantic Ocean. The river forms the last few kilometres of the international land boundary between Ghana and Ivory Coast.
Indigious local beliefs of Bono hold that Taakora, the highest of the Bono gods on Earth, lives at the source of the river.

The last few individuals of Miss Waldron&#x27;s Red Colobus (&quot;Piliocolobus badius waldronae&quot;), one of the world&#x27;s most threatened primates, are believed to live in the forest between the river and Ehy Lagoon. As of mid-2008, this area is slated for logging by Unilever, with the aim to replace it with oil palm plantations.

In January of 2020, a truck with loads of sulfuric acid plunged into the Tano river. On January 13 the people were advised to not drink the water because of contamination. The river has since been restored to its natural state.

<text>The is located in Shiga Prefecture, Japan; it is the largest river to flow into Lake Biwa. 

== Geography ==
The Yasu river rises from Mount Gozaisho and flows through Kōka, Konan, Rittō, Moriyama and Yasu. It forked at the lower reaches and made a delta region, but the various forks were combined in 1979.

== History ==
The Tōkaidō, one of the Edo Five Routes which connected east and west Japan during the Edo period, paralleled the river. Post towns along the river included Tsuchiyama-juku, Minakuchi-juku and Ishibe-juku. 

The Yasu River also crossed the Nakasendō, another one of the Edo Five Routes, separating Moriyama-juku and Musa-juku.

<text>Tettnang () is a town in the Bodensee district in southern Baden-Württemberg in Swabia region of Germany.

It lies 7 kilometres from Lake Constance. The region produces significant quantities of Tettnang hop, an ingredient of beer, and ships them to breweries throughout the world.

==History==
Tettinang or Tettinac was first mentioned in 882 in a document of the Abbey of St. Gall. In the beginning of the 10th century the castle of the Counts of Montfort was built near the town. The town privileges were granted in 1294 by King Adolf of Nassau. The reign of the Counts of Montfort ended 1780 when they sold the county to Austria, along with Tettnang Castle to pay debts. The county became part of Further Austria under the house of Habsburg. In the Peace of Pressburg of 1805 it became Bavarian property which gave it to Württemberg five years later. With the merge of Baden, Hohenzollern and Württemberg in 1952 it became part of the new formed state Baden-Württemberg. Until 1973 it was capital of the district Tettnang which was merged with parts of district of Überlingen to form the Bodenseekreis.

==Population development==
==Trivia==
The second release of the Linux operating system Fedora was named &quot;Tettnang&quot; because of the hops grown in Tettnang being used for making beer. The release was preceded by the beer-related name &quot;Yarrow&quot; (an early substitute for hops) and followed by &quot;Heidelberg&quot; (a German city and the name of a distributor of beer).

The anti-virus software vendor Avira, a company with around 100 million customers and 500 employees all over the world, has its headquarters in Tettnang. Based near Lake Constance, the security specialist is one of the biggest regional entrepreneurs.

<text>John Bubenheim Bayard (11 August 1738 – 7 January 1807) was a merchant, soldier, and statesman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He achieved the rank of colonel while serving with the Continental Army, and was a delegate for Pennsylvania to the Congress of the Confederation in 1785 and 1786. Later he was elected as mayor of New Brunswick, New Jersey.

==Early life==
John Bubenheim Bayard was born on 11 August 1738 to James Bayard (1717–1780) and the former Mary Asheton (b. ca. 1715) at Bohemia Manor, Cecil County, Maryland. He had a twin brother, James Asheton Bayard (1738–1770).

Their father James was the youngest son of Samuel Bayard (1675–1721), who was born in New Amsterdam, and Susanna Bouchelle (1678–1750), both of French Huguenot ancestry. He also had Dutch and English ancestry as well. James Bayard was educated at West Nottingham Academy under the tutelage of the Rev. Samuel Finley, who later became the 5th President of Princeton University.

===Family===
Bayard&#x27;s paternal line were French Huguenots who escaped France through the Netherlands. His 2x great-grandfather, Samuel Bayard (d. ca. 1647), the son of the Rev. Balthazar Bayard, married Ann Stuyvesant, the daughter of the Rev. Balthazar Stuyvesant, in the Netherlands in 1638. After Samuel Bayard&#x27;s death, she brought their four children, of which Petrus Bayard (d. 1690), John Bayard&#x27;s great-grandfather, was the eldest, to New Netherland with her brother Peter Stuyvesant in 1647. In 1698, John Bayard&#x27;s grandfather, Samuel Bayard (1675–1721), moved to Maryland and established a plantation known as Bohemia Manor in Cecil County. It remained the seat of the family for several generations of the Bayard family.

==Career==
In 1755, John Bayard moved to Philadelphia and became a merchant. He entered the business world in the counting-room of a merchant, John Rhea. He began making his own investments in shipping voyages, prospered, and became one of the leaders in the merchant community. When he joined his own firm, it was named &quot;Hedge &amp; Bayard&quot;. In 1765 Bayard signed the non-importation agreement in protest of the Stamp Act, even though it hurt his own business. By 1766, he had become one of the leaders of the Philadelphia Sons of Liberty.

===Revolutionary War===
Bayard was elected to the convention of Pennsylvania in July 1774, and re-elected in 1775. This group was originally the revolutionary counter to the official assembly, but eventually replaced it as the legislature for the new government. When regiments were raised for the defense of Philadelphia in 1775, Bayard became Colonel of the second regiment. In 1776, when the convention had become a constitutional assembly, he was named to the &quot;Committee of Safety&quot;. In March 1777, he became a member of the state&#x27;s &quot;Board of War&quot;, and the Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly, and was re-elected in 1778.

In the meantime, Hedge &amp; Bayard was contracted with the Continental Congress to supply the Continental Army. Bayard fitted out a ship sent out as a privateer. But, in the fall of 1777, the British occupied Philadelphia. Bayard moved his family to a farm at Plymouth. After getting them settled, he took to the field with his regiment. They fought at the Battles of Brandywine, Germantown, and Princeton. Bayard was cited by General Washington for his gallant leadership in the Battle of Princeton.

In 1781, Bayard became head of the Board of War, and as such joined the state&#x27;s Executive Council. Under Pennsylvania&#x27;s 1776 constitution this was a kind of combination of the roles of a governor&#x27;s cabinet and the state Senate. In 1785 he was elected to the Congress of the Confederation, the successor of the Continental Congress. He served there in 1785 and 1786, attending their meetings in New York, then the temporary seat of government. In 1787, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

===Later life===
By 1788, Bayard had settled most of the debts he had run up during the war. He was forced to sell the estate in Maryland to another branch of the family, and closed down his Philadelphia business. He built a new home in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and moved there in the expectation of retiring. But in 1790, he was elected mayor of New Brunswick. Then, for many of his remaining years he sat as the judge in the court of common pleas for Middlesex County. He died at home in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on January 7, 1807, and is buried in the First Presbyterian Churchyard there.

==Personal life==
In 1759, he married Margaret Hodge (1740–1780), the daughter of Andrew Hodge (1711–1789), sister of Andrew Hodge and Hugh Hodge, and the aunt of Rev. Charles Hodge (1797–1878), in Philadelphia. Before her death in 1780, the couple had several children, including:

* James Ashton Bayard (1760–1788), who graduated from Princeton in 1781, and who married to Eliza Rodgers, daughter of Dr. John Rodgers, a trustee of Princeton from 1765 to 1807.
* Andrew Bayard (1762–1833), who graduated from Princeton in 1779, and who married a daughter of Col. Charles Pettit
* John Murray Bayard (1766–1823), who married Margaret Carrick.
* Samuel Bayard (1766–1840), who graduated from Princeton in 1784, and who married Martha Pintard, daughter of Lewis Pintard and Susan Stockton (sister of Richard Stockton)
* Jane Bayard (1772–1851), who married Andrew Kirkpatrick (1756–1831)
* Nicholas Serl Bayard (1774–1821), who in 1798 married Anna Livingston Bayard (d. 1802), the daughter of Nicholas Bayard (1736–1798) and Catherine Livingston (1743–1775). The latter was the daughter of Peter Van Brugh Livingston and his wife. After Anna&#x27;s death in 1802, he married Esther McIntosh, the daughter of Gen. Lachlan McIntosh and the former Sarah Threadcraft.
* Margaret Bayard (1778–1844), who married Samuel Harrison Smith (1772–1845) in 1800 and became a published writer. She is best known for her posthumously published memoir, &quot;The First Forty Years of Washington Society&quot; (1906), drawn from her letters to family and friends.
* Anna Bayard (1779–1869), who married Samuel Boyd.

The household was enlarged after the couple adopted the three orphaned children of John&#x27;s twin brother, James Asheton Bayard I (1738–1770). He had married Margaret Hodge&#x27;s sister Ann, who also died young. Two young nephews and a niece joined the John Bayard household in 1770: John H. Bayard (1762–1820), Jane Bayard (b. 1765), and James Asheton Bayard II (1767–1815). He graduated from Princeton in 1784.

In 1781, shortly after the death of his first wife Margaret, Bayard remarried, to Mary (née Grant) Hodgson (d. 1785). She was a widow of John Hodgson of South Carolina.

After Mary&#x27;s death in 1785, Bayard married for the third and final time to Johannah White (d. 1834), sister of General Anthony Walton White (1750–1803), sister-in-law of William Paterson (1745–1806), and granddaughter of Lewis Morris (1671–1746), the Chief Justice of New York from 1715 to 1733 and Governor of New Jersey from 1738 to 1746.

<text>John Torchetti (born July 9, 1964) is a former American ice hockey player and coach, currently serving as an assistant coach for the Philadelphia Flyers. Torchetti has been an interim head coach in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Florida Panthers, the Los Angeles Kings, and Minnesota Wild.

Torchetti has served as the head coach for the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League (2002–2003), the Moncton Wildcats of the QMJHL (2006–2007), and the Iowa Wild of the American Hockey League (2014–2016). He served as an assistant coach with the Atlanta Thrashers, Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Tampa Bay Lightning in the NHL, as well as the Kontinental Hockey League&#x27;s HC CSKA Moscow.

==Playing career==
Torchetti played prep school hockey for the powerful New Preparatory School of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a post-graduate at the age of eighteen under the coaching tutelage of the regionally renowned George Kozack. Before attending New Prep School, Torchetti played for Jamaica Plain High School in the Boston City League, where he set state scoring records, superseding the ones achieved in the late 1960s by Robbie Ftorek of Needham High School.

Torchetti started his professional career as a member of the Carolina Thunderbirds, where he would spend seven of his eight seasons. Torchetti led the All-American Hockey League (AAHL) in goals (63), assists (71), and points (134) during the 1987–88 AAHL season. He would have a brief call-up with the Binghamton Whalers of the American Hockey League at the start of the 1988–89 season, but returned to Carolina, which had since helped found the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL), after ten games.

After eight seasons in the minors, Torchetti retired from hockey after the 1990–91 ECHL season.

==Coaching career==
His first coaching assignment came as an assistant coach for the Greensboro Monarchs of the ECHL. His first head coaching position was with the San Antonio Iguanas of the Central Hockey League, where he took over when Bill Goldsworthy became ill. He coached the Iguanas to the finals twice in two years and won the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy for coach of the year in 1995. After spending the first half of the 1996–97 season as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Dragons of the International Hockey League, Torchetti became head coach of the Fort Wayne Komets. In 1998, he won the Commissioners&#x27; Trophy.

Before the 1999–2000 NHL season Torchetti was hired as an assistant coach for the Tampa Bay Lightning under Steve Ludzik. In 2002, Torchetti returned to San Antonio when he was hired as head coach of the San Antonio Rampage in the American Hockey League (AHL). After 65 games he was promoted to assistant coach with the parent club, the Florida Panthers. In 2004, he served 27 games as interim head coach, replacing Rick Dudley. He finished with a 10–12–4–1 record before being replaced by Jacques Martin. During the 2005–06 NHL season, Torchetti was hired by Dave Taylor as interim head coach of the Los Angeles Kings. With a chance to clinch a playoff spot, he had a 5–7 record in the team&#x27;s final 12 games and was not retained by the Kings, instead being replaced by Marc Crawford.

In 2006, he was hired by the Moncton Wildcats to replace Ted Nolan as head coach and director of hockey operations. He coached the team to a 39–25–0–4 record and a third-placed finish in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League&#x27;s Eastern Division. The Wildcats were eliminated in the first round by the Halifax Mooseheads.

Torchetti was hired as an associate coach for the Chicago Blackhawks on May 16, 2007, and won his first Stanley Cup in 2010.

On July 8, 2010, it was announced that Torchetti has been hired by the Atlanta Thrashers as the associate head coach under Craig Ramsay.

On July 5, 2011, he was announced as the new head coach of the Houston Aeros in the AHL, replacing Mike Yeo.

On June 24, 2013, he was introduced as the new head coach of the Kontinental Hockey League&#x27;s CSKA Moscow.

On November 12, 2014, he was announced as the head coach of the Iowa Wild. He replaced Kurt Kleinendorst, who had started the season with a 2–10 record. This marked a return to a franchise he led in Houston. On February 13, 2016, Torchetti he was promoted to the interim head coach of the NHL&#x27;s Minnesota Wild.

On June 9, 2016, Torchetti was named an assistant coach for the Detroit Red Wings.

On January 15, 2019, Torchetti was announced to return as the head coach and director of hockey operations for the Moncton Wildcats. On December 14, 2019, the Wildcats announced that Torchetti was fired, a decision made due to &quot;internal reasons.&quot;

<doc id="661455" wikidata="Q1247248" url="?curid=661455" title="Picket Fences">
<text>Picket Fences is an American family drama television series about the residents of the town of Rome, Wisconsin, created and produced by David E. Kelley. The show ran from September 18, 1992, to June 26, 1996, on CBS in the United States. It sometimes struggled to maintain a stable primetime audience and had fluctuating ratings, due in part to its Friday night death slot. In its first season on the air, it placed 63rd in prime-time Nielsen ratings and in its second season it moved to 61st. Nonetheless, the show won critical acclaim and was a major awards winner, winning 14 Primetime Emmy Awards during its run and is now regarded as a cult classic. The show&#x27;s exteriors were shot in the L.A. suburb of Monrovia, California.

==Overview==
The series follows the lives of the residents of the small town of Rome, Wisconsin, where weird things happen, including cows&#x27; udders exploding and people turning up dead in freezers. The show dealt with unusual topics for the primetime television of the period, such as abortion, incest, homophobia and LGBT adoption, transsexual, racism, belief in God, ethics in medicine, polygamy, polyamory, adolescent sexuality, date rape, cryonics, the Holocaust, shoe fetishism, masturbation, animal sacrifice, spontaneous human combustion, and constitutional rights. Illustrative of the subject matter is that the regular cast included a judge, two lawyers, and a medical examiner. Religious issues were frequently discussed, and the town&#x27;s Catholic and Episcopal priests were frequently recurring characters, as well as lawyer Douglas Wambaugh&#x27;s relationships in his local Jewish temple.

Struggling to maintain order in the community is Sheriff Jimmy Brock (Tom Skerritt). Sheriff Brock is 52 years old, married to the town doctor, Jill (Kathy Baker), his second wife. They raise their three children, Kimberly (Holly Marie Combs) from Jimmy&#x27;s first marriage to Lydia Brock (Cristine Rose), Matthew (Justin Shenkarow) and Zachary (Adam Wylie).

Maxine &#x27;Max&#x27; Stewart (Lauren Holly) and Kenny Lacos (Costas Mandylor) are impulsive and slightly immature sheriff&#x27;s deputies. Kelly Connell played medical examiner Carter Pike (who regularly begged to be deputized) and Zelda Rubinstein portrayed police dispatcher Ginny Weedon.

Bombastic lawyer Douglas Wambaugh (Fyvush Finkel) usually irritated Judge Henry Bone (Ray Walston). Wambaugh refused to hear any confessions of guilt from his clients as he feared that it would only stand in the way of adequately defending them in court; and Bone&#x27;s rulings seemed to be directed more by his own moral compass than by points of law, though his decisions were almost never reversed. After several prosecutors came and went, Don Cheadle joined the cast as John Littleton.

Other actors who were in the cast included Marlee Matlin as Mayor Laurie Bey / The Dancing Bandit, Richard Masur as Ed Lawson, Roy Brocksmith as elementary school principal Michael Oslo, Jack Murdock as ethically challenged city councilman Harold Lundstrom, Roy Dotrice as Father Gary Barrett, a Catholic priest, and Dabbs Greer as the Reverend Henry Novotny, priest of the local Episcopal church.

==Cast==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Episodes==
&quot;Picket Fences&quot; has a total of 88 episodes and four seasons.

===Crossovers===
The series has two crossover episodes with another David E. Kelley series, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, one occurring in each series. In the first, on &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, Dr. Jill Brock accompanies Douglas Wambaugh to Chicago Hope Hospital over concerns of his heart. In the second, Wambaugh is back at Chicago Hope Hospital causing trouble for the doctors. Lauren Holly later joined the cast of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; as Dr. Jeremy Hanlon and Tom Skerritt appear in a different role as a guest star.

David E. Kelley and Chris Carter (creator of &quot;The X-Files&quot;) were talking in a parking lot on the Fox lot one day and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an &quot;X-Files&quot; episode. Originally, the two shows would be shot with different viewpointsone from the &quot;X-Files&quot; perspective and the other from &quot;Picket Fences&quot;″. The official approval was never given by Fox and CBS, so the only remnants remaining of this effort are the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Red Museum&quot; and the &quot;Picket Fences&quot; episode &quot;Away in the Manger&quot; having similar plotlines involving cows. Every reference to &quot;Picket Fences&quot; has been purged from the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode, but there still are some small details left in the &quot;Picket Fences&quot; episode referring to the happenings at &quot;The X-Files&quot; and some minor characters there.

==Ratings==
==Adaptation==
The series was adapted in India in Hindi language and aired on StarPlus as &quot;Kehta Hai Dil&quot; from 2002 to 2005 produced by UTV Software Communications. However, the Indian version in between deviated entirely from the story of &quot;Picket Fences&quot;.

==Home media==
On June 19, 2007, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;Picket Fences&quot; on DVD in Region 1. In the United States, the entire series was available to stream on Hulu from Thanksgiving 2021 to Thanksgiving 2023. On August 20, 2014, Season 1 was released in Australia.
 Season 2 was released in Australia in December 2014. Season 3 was released in Australia in March 2016.

==Awards and nominations==

&quot;Picket Fences&quot; won fourteen Emmy Awards (including &quot;Outstanding Drama Series&quot; twice) and one Golden Globe Award in its four-year run. In 1997, the episode &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; was ranked #96 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2002, the character of Douglas Wambaugh was ranked 47th on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest Television Characters of All Time list.

<doc id="661459" wikidata="Q526811" url="?curid=661459" title="Andy Murray (ice hockey)">
<text>Andy Murray (born March 3, 1951) is the former head coach for the Western Michigan Broncos men&#x27;s ice hockey team of the NCAA Division I National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC). He is a former head coach of the Los Angeles Kings and the St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League.

Murray has 20 years of NHL experience as an assistant or head coach. He has also coached at the junior, high school, and college levels, as well as in the North American minor leagues and European professional leagues. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life and career==
Andy Murray&#x27;s family had an auto dealership in Souris, Manitoba that was started by Murray&#x27;s grandfather. Once Murray was old enough, he began to work there. In 1976, when Murray was 25 years old, his uncle hired him to be the coach of the Brandon Travellers after a brawl. Three years later, he got the head-coaching job at Brandon University in Manitoba while still working at the dealership during the day. In 1981, his father died the day after a victory that qualified Brandon for a National tournament. After that season, he needed to get away, and took a coaching job in Switzerland. In 1988, he went to the United States to be the assistant coach for the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League. That year, the Bears won the AHL championship and the Calder Cup, and he was promoted as an assistant coach of the Philadelphia Flyers under head coach Paul Holmgren. He spent two years there before joining as an assistant coach with the Minnesota North Stars under head coach Bob Gainey, where the team made it to the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals. In 1992, he went back to Switzerland to coach for Lugano. Two months later, he quit because of a fan revolt and is replaced by former head coach John Sletvoll. After that, he took a job in Germany before returning to assistant coaching with the Winnipeg Jets under John Paddock, where he stayed until 1995. Murray was named the coach of the Canadian National Hockey Team in 1996, a post he held until 1998. He served as head coach at Shattuck-St. Mary&#x27;s School for the 1998–99 season.

==NHL coaching career==
On June 14, 1999, Andy was named to replace Larry Robinson as the new head coach of the Los Angeles Kings, where he stayed for seven seasons. By the end of his tenure, he was the all-time franchise leader in wins (215) and games coached (480).

His best success came in 2001, when the Kings forced the Colorado Avalanche to a seven-game series in the Western Conference Semifinals. The Kings forced the seventh game after previously being down three games to one. He garnered a lot of media attention after publicly stating that anyone on his team that wasn&#x27;t going to give 100% was not to travel with team back to Colorado for game five of the series. The Kings responded, winning game five, 1–0. They made Murray proud once again in game six, when Glen Murray scored in the second overtime to win the game for the Kings, 1–0.

On March 21, 2006, Murray was fired by the Kings and was replaced on an interim basis by John Torchetti. At the time of Murray&#x27;s dismissal, the Kings had posted a 37–28–5 record. He provided colour commentary for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation during their &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; telecasts of the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs.

On December 11, 2006, the St. Louis Blues hired Murray to replace Mike Kitchen as head coach after a seven-game losing streak. He coached the Blues to a record of 33–36–13 in his first full season as coach in 2007–2008. On April 10, 2009, Murray coached the Blues from a 15th place showing in the Western Conference at the All-Star Break to a 25–9–7 record down the stretch to clinching the sixth playoff spot, marking the team&#x27;s first Stanley Cup playoffs appearance since the 2004–05 lockout. Murray&#x27;s Blues took on the Vancouver Canucks in the opening round of the 2009 Stanley Cup Playoffs and were swept. Murray was named a finalist for the Jack Adams Award for coach of the year during the off-season but lost to Claude Julien of the Boston Bruins.

On January 2, 2010, Murray was fired as Blues coach with a 17–17–4 record. He was replaced with Davis Payne, the head coach of the Blues AHL affiliate Peoria Rivermen.

==International coaching career==
He coached Canada to three gold medals at the IIHF World Championships in 1997, 2003 and 2007. He was the first coach in IIHF World Championship history to win three championships. In the 2010 World Championships, he acted as a consultant to the Swiss team.

Murray served as associate coach for Team Canada under Marc Crawford at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan – the first Olympics to feature current NHL players. Murray, who was in his third year as head coach of the Canadian National Team, was hired in part for his experience with the international rink, a larger playing surface. The Canadians concluded the tournament with a loss to Finland in the bronze medal game.

Murray has a record six gold medals as a coach for Canada at the Spengler Cup tournament in Davos, Switzerland, earning the title &quot;Mister Spengler Cup&quot;. He headed Team Canada six times – 1984, 1986, 1987, 1992, 1995,1997 – and won the cup each time.

In 2012, Murray was inducted into the builder category of the IIHF Hall of Fame.

==Collegiate coaching career==
On July 25, 2011, Murray was announced as the head coach of the Western Michigan Broncos. Murray replaced Jeff Blashill, who left WMU after one season to join the NHL&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings as an assistant coach.

Murray had no prior experience coaching college hockey in the United States, although he did spend several seasons as head coach in the late 1970s at Brandon University in Manitoba, Canada and had turned down an offer to coach at Rensselaer in 2006. Murray stated at his introductory press conference that coaching college hockey was on his bucket list, and that he loved the college atmosphere and college sports. Murray signed a five-year, $1.5 million contract. Other known finalists for the position included Ron Rolston, a veteran assistant coach of several college and minor league programs, and former WMU player and incumbent WMU assistant coach Pat Ferschweiler. Ferschweiler was retained by Murray and elevated to the position of associate head coach in 2013.

In his first season with WMU (2011–12), the Broncos went 21–14–6, good enough for second-place in the CCHA regular season standings. 
The team went on to claim the 2012 CCHA men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament championship with a 3–2 victory over Michigan in the championship game. It was the second CCHA championship for the Broncos, the first coming in 1986. The Broncos then participated in the 2012 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s ice hockey tournament for the fifth time overall, and second year in a row. The fourth seeded Broncos fell in the first round to WCHA champion and number one seed North Dakota by a score of 3–1.

In Murray&#x27;s second season (2012–13), WMU finished 19–11–8, good for third place in the season-ending CCHA standings. After earning a first round bye in the CCHA tournament, the Broncos fell in the second round to the lower-seeded Michigan, ending their season. The CCHA disbanded following the season as a result of conference realignment stemming from the start of sponsored hockey in the Big Ten Conference.

In his third season at WMU (2013–14), Murray&#x27;s Broncos finished 19–16–5, including conference play in their new home with the National Collegiate Hockey Conference, a startup of former CCHA and WCHA programs. In December, WMU won the Great Lakes Invitational, a four team tournament held outdoors at Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan. The Broncos prevailed over runner-up Michigan Tech in the final for the championship, as well as outpacing third-place Michigan State and fourth-place Michigan. It was the second GLI championship for the Broncos, who also won in 1986. Western finished the season in a tie for 4th place in the inaugural NCHC league standings, considerably higher than pre-season polls had predicted for the newer, stronger conference.

==Personal life==
Andy and his wife, Ruth, have three children (all hockey players): sons Brady Murray and Jordan Murray, and daughter Sarah Murray. Brady played college hockey at North Dakota and was a fifth round draft pick of the Los Angeles Kings in 2003 while his father was head coach. Jordan Murray played college hockey at Wisconsin and daughter Sarah Murray played college hockey for the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women&#x27;s ice hockey program. All three of the Murray children hold US–Canadian dual citizenship and played professional hockey in Switzerland.

Murray is a former co-owner of the Salmon Arm Silverbacks of the British Columbia Junior Hockey League. He sold his stake in the team in 2007.

Andy Murray is a distant cousin to former NHL veteran center Marty Murray.

In 2017 he was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Laws (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) from Brandon University.

<text>In archaeology, a racloir, also known as &quot;racloirs sur talon&quot; (French for scraper on heel), is a certain type of flint tool made by prehistoric peoples.

It is a type of side scraper distinctive of Mousterian assemblages. It is created from a flint flake and looks like a large scraper. As well as being used for scraping hides and bark, it may also have been used as a knife. Racloirs are most associated with the Neanderthal Mousterian industry. These racloirs are retouched along the ridge between the striking platform and the dorsal face. They have shaped edges and are modified by abrupt flaking from the dorsal face.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of Ontario (OLA; ) is the legislative chamber of the Canadian province of Ontario. Its elected members are known as Members of Provincial Parliament (MPPs). Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor of Ontario to become law. Together, the Legislative Assembly and Lieutenant Governor make up the unicameral Legislature of Ontario. The assembly meets at the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen&#x27;s Park in the provincial capital of Toronto.

Ontario uses a Westminster-style parliamentary government in which members are elected to the Legislative Assembly through general elections using a &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system. The premier of Ontario (the province&#x27;s head of government) holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the Legislative Assembly, typically sitting as an MPP themselves and lead the largest party or a coalition in the Legislative Assembly. The largest party not forming the government is known as the Official Opposition, its leader being recognized as leader of the Opposition.

The Ontario Legislature is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ontario Provincial Parliament&quot;. Members of the assembly refer to themselves as &quot;Members of the Provincial Parliament&quot; MPPs as opposed to &quot;Members of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (MLAs) as in many other provinces. Ontario is the only province to do so, in accordance with a resolution passed in the Assembly on April 7, 1938. However, the &quot;Legislative Assembly Act&quot; refers only to &quot;members of the Assembly&quot;. The Legislative Assembly is the second largest Canadian provincial deliberative assembly by number of members after the National Assembly of Quebec.

The current assembly was elected on June 2, 2022, as part of the 43rd Parliament of Ontario.

Owing to the location of the Legislative Building on the grounds of Queen&#x27;s Park, the metonym &quot;Queen&#x27;s Park&quot; is often used to refer to both the provincial government and the Legislative Assembly.

==Lawmaking==

In accordance with the traditions of the Westminster system, most laws originate in the provincial cabinet (government bills) and are passed by the legislature after multiple rounds of debate and decision-making. Backbench legislators may introduce private legislation (private-member bills) or amend bills presented to the legislature by cabinet, playing an integral role in scrutinizing bills both at the debate as well as committee stages.

In the Ontario legislature, this confrontation provides much of the material for Oral Questions and Members&#x27; Statements. Legislative scrutiny of the executive is also at the heart of much of the work carried out by the Legislature&#x27;s Standing Committees, which are made up of ordinary backbenchers.

A member&#x27;s day will typically be divided among participating in the business of the House, attending caucus and committee meetings, speaking in various debates, or returning to his or her constituency to address the concerns, problems and grievances of constituents. Depending on personal inclination and political circumstances, some Members concentrate most of their attention on House matters while others focus on constituency problems, taking on something of an ombudsman&#x27;s role in the process.

Finally, it is the task of the legislature to provide the personnel of the executive. As already noted, under responsible government, ministers of the Crown are expected to be Members of the Assembly. When a political party comes to power it will usually place its more experienced parliamentarians into the key cabinet positions, where their parliamentary experience may be the best preparation for the rough and tumble of political life in government.

==History==

The Legislative Assembly was established by the British North America Act, 1867 (later re-titled &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;), which dissolved the Province of Canada into two new provinces, with the portion then called Canada West becoming Ontario.

As such, the 1st Parliament of Ontario was one of the three legislative bodies succeeding the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada&#x27;s 8th Parliament.

The first election in 1867 produced a tie between Conservatives led by John Sandfield Macdonald and the Liberals led by Archibald McKellar. Macdonald led a coalition government with the support of moderate Liberals. John Stevenson served as the first speaker for the assembly. Its first session ran from September 3, 1867, until February 25, 1871, just prior to the 1871 general election.

The Legislature has been unicameral since its inception, with the Assembly currently having 124 seats (increased from 107 as of the 42nd Ontario general election) representing electoral districts (&quot;ridings&quot;) elected through a first-past-the-post electoral system across the province.

In 1938, the title of Member of the Legislative Assembly was officially changed to Member of Provincial Parliament. Previously, multiple terms were unofficially used in the media and in the Legislature.

Ontario uses the same boundaries as those at the federal level for its Legislative Assembly in Southern Ontario, while seats in Northern Ontario correspond to the federal districts that were in place before the 2004 adjustment. Ontario had separate provincial electoral districts prior to 1999.

===Timeline of the 44th Parliament of Ontario===
The following notable events occurred during the 2025–present period: 
====Summary of seat changes====
==Media==

Regular Legislative Assembly proceedings are broadcast to subscribers of the Ontario Parliament Network in Ontario. A late-night rebroadcast of Question Period is also occasionally aired on TVO, the provincial public broadcaster.

==Officers==
The Legislative Assembly of Ontario, like the federal House of Commons, also includes procedural officers who administer the business of the legislature and impartially assist the Speaker and MPPs with their duties. These officers collectively make up the Office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The Office of the Assembly consists of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker as well as the Clerk of the Legislative Assembly, Sergeant-at-Arms, executive director of Administrative Services, and executive director of Legislative Library, Research and Information Services. The Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario is the chief permanent officer of the Legislative Assembly, with the rank and status of a Deputy Minister, responsible for administering the legislature and advising MPPs on questions of procedure or interpretation of the rules and practices of the House. The Sergeant-at-Arms keeps order during meetings in the legislature, is charged with control of the ceremonial mace in the legislature, and is responsible for security in the House and the Legislative Precinct.

=== Independent offices protecting certain public interests ===
Additional officers of the Legislative Assembly were created to protect certain public interests, these officers are appointed by unanimous votes of the legislature and report to the legislature through the Speaker rather than to the provincial government. These officers include the Auditor General, Information and Privacy Commissioner, Integrity Commissioner, Chief Electoral Officer, Ontario Ombudsman, and Poet Laureate of Ontario.

==Symbols==
===Coat of arms===

The Legislative Assembly of Ontario is the first and only legislature in Canada to have a coat of arms separate from the provincial arms. Green and gold are the principal colours, as in the coat of arms of Ontario. A mace is the traditional symbol of the authority of the Speaker. Shown on the left is the current mace, while on the right is the original mace from the time of the first parliament in 1792. The crossed maces are joined by the shield of arms of Ontario.

The coronet on the wreath represents national and provincial loyalties, while its rim is studded with the provincial gemstone, the amethyst. The griffin, an ancient symbol of justice and equity, holds a calumet, which symbolizes the meeting of spirit and discussion that Ontario&#x27;s First Nations believe accompanies the use of the pipe.

The deer represent the natural riches of the province. The Loyalist coronets at their necks honour the original British settlers in Ontario who brought with them the British parliamentary form of government. The royal crowns (left 1992, right 1792) recognize the parliamentary bicentennial and represent Ontario&#x27;s heritage as a constitutional monarchy. They were granted as a special honour by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of the Governor General.

In the base, the maple leaves are for Canada, the trilliums for Ontario and the roses for York (now Toronto), the provincial capital.

===Mace===

The ceremonial mace of the Legislature is the fourth mace to be used in Upper Canada or Ontario. It acts as a symbol, representing the authority of the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario to oversee the proceedings of the assembly.

The first mace was used by the Chamber of Upper Canada&#x27;s first Parliament in 1792 at Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) and then moved to York (now Toronto). The primitive wooden mace was painted red and gilt, and surmounted by a crown of thin brass strips. It was stolen by American troops as a Prize of War in 1813 at the Battle of York during the War of 1812. The mace was subsequently stored at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. It remained in the United States until 1934, when it was returned to Ontario after President Franklin Roosevelt sent an order to Congress to return the mace. It was initially kept at the Royal Ontario Museum for a time, and it is now located in the Main Lobby of the Ontario Legislative Building.

A second mace was introduced in 1813 and used until 1841.

The third mace was not purchased until 1845. In 1849, it was stolen by a riotous mob in Montreal, apparently intent upon destroying it in a public demonstration. However, it was rescued and returned to the Speaker, Sir Allan Macnab, the next day. Later, in 1854, the mace was twice rescued when the Parliament Buildings in Quebec were ravaged by fire. The mace continued to be used by the Union Parliament in Toronto and Quebec until Confederation in 1867, when it was taken to the Parliament of Canada in Ottawa, where it remained in the House of Commons until 1916. When the Parliament Buildings were gutted by fire during that year, the mace could not be saved from Centre Block. All that remained was a tiny ball of silver and gold conglomerate.
The current mace used in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario was acquired in 1867, after Confederation. It was provided by Charles E. Zollikofer of Ottawa for $200. The four-foot mace is made of copper and richly gilded, a flattened ball at the butt end. Initially, the head of the mace bore the crown of Queen Victoria and in a cup with her royal cypher, V.R. When she was succeeded by Edward VII in 1901, her crown and cup were removed and a new one bearing Edward&#x27;s cypher on the cup was installed. Eventually, it was replaced with the current cup, which is adorned in gleaming brass leaves.

Through some careful detective work on the part of Legislative Assembly staff, the original cup with Queen Victoria&#x27;s cypher was recently found in the Royal Ontario Museum’s collection and returned to the Legislature. It is now on display in the Ontario Legislative Building.

In 2009, two diamonds were installed in the mace. The diamonds were a gift to the people of Ontario from De Beers Canada to mark the opening of the Victor Mine near Attawapiskat in northern Ontario. Three diamonds were selected from the first run of the mine. Two stones, one rough and one polished, were set in platinum in the crown of the mace while the third stone, also polished, was put on exhibit in the lobby of the Legislative Building as part of a display about the history of the mace.

==Party standings==
Elections to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario occurred on June 2, 2022, as a result of which the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, led by Doug Ford, was re-elected as His Majesty&#x27;s Government of Ontario.

===Seating plan===
The seating chamber is similar in layout to that of the British House of Commons and the original St. Stephen&#x27;s Chapel in the Palace of Westminster. The Parliament of Ontario, however, may be easily distinguished from this model by its use of individual chairs and tables for members, absent in the British Commons&#x27; design.

The legislature&#x27;s former host building and site, home to the Upper Canada and Union Houses, once boasted of a similar layout.

<text>A Tipler cylinder, also called a Tipler time machine, is a hypothetical object theorized to be a potential mode of time travel—although results have shown that a Tipler cylinder could only allow time travel if its length were infinite or with the existence of negative energy.

== Discovery ==
The Tipler cylinder was discovered as a solution to the equations of general relativity by Willem Jacob van Stockum in 1936 and Kornel Lanczos in 1924, but not recognized as allowing closed timelike curves until an analysis by Frank Tipler in 1974. Tipler showed in his 1974 article &quot;Rotating Cylinders and the Possibility of Global Causality Violation&quot; that in a spacetime containing a &quot;sufficiently large rotating cylinder&quot; spinning around its axis, the cylinder should create a frame-dragging effect. This frame-dragging effect warps spacetime in such a way that the light cones of objects in the cylinder&#x27;s proximity become tilted, so that part of the light cone then points backwards along the time axis on a spacetime diagram. Therefore, a spacecraft accelerating sufficiently in the appropriate direction can travel backwards through time along a closed timelike curve.

CTCs are associated, in Lorentzian manifolds which are interpreted physically as spacetimes, with the possibility of causal anomalies such as a person going back in time and potentially shooting their own grandfather, although paradoxes might be avoided using some constraint such as the Novikov self-consistency principle. They appear in some of the most important exact solutions in general relativity, including the Kerr vacuum (which models a rotating black hole) and the van Stockum dust (which models a cylindrically symmetrical configuration of rotating pressureless fluid or dust).

== Practicality ==
An objection to the practicality of building a Tipler cylinder was discovered by Stephen Hawking, who argued that according to general relativity it is impossible to build a time machine in any finite region that satisfies the weak energy condition, meaning that the region contains no exotic matter with negative energy. The Tipler cylinder, on the other hand, does not involve any negative energy. Tipler&#x27;s original solution involved a cylinder of infinite length, which is easier to analyze mathematically, and although Tipler suggested that a finite cylinder might produce closed timelike curves if the rotation rate were fast enough, he did not prove this. But Hawking comments: &quot;it can&#x27;t be done with positive energy density everywhere! I can prove that to build a finite time machine, you need negative energy.&quot; Hawking&#x27;s argument appears in his 1992 paper on the chronology protection conjecture (though the argument is distinct from the conjecture itself, since the argument asserts that classical general relativity predicts a finite region containing closed timelike curves can only be created if there is a violation of the weak energy condition in that region, whereas the conjecture predicts that closed timelike curves will prove to be impossible in a future theory of quantum gravity which replaces general relativity). In the paper, he examines &quot;the case that the causality violations appear in a finite region of spacetime without curvature singularities&quot; and proves that &quot;[t]here will be a Cauchy horizon that is compactly generated and that in general contains one or more closed null geodesics which will be incomplete. One can define geometrical quantities that measure the Lorentz boost and area increase on going round these closed null geodesics. If the causality violation developed from a noncompact initial surface, the averaged weak energy condition must be violated on the Cauchy horizon.&quot;

<text>Robert Wright (November 20, 1752September 7, 1826) was an American politician and soldier who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

==Early life==
Wright was born at Narborough, near Chestertown, Maryland, and attended the Kent Free School (later Washington College) of Chestertown. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1773, and commenced practice in Chestertown.

==Career==
He served in the Maryland militia during the American Revolutionary War as private, lieutenant, and later as captain. After the war, he served as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1784 to 1786, and as a member of the Maryland State Senate in 1801.

In 1800, Wright was elected as a Democratic Republican to the United States Senate on November 19, 1801, for the term commencing March 4, 1801. In the Senate, Wright served as delegate to the Farmers’ National Convention in 1803. He resigned from the Senate on November 12, 1806, having been elected the 12th Governor of Maryland, a position he served in from 1806 to 1809.

After his tenure as governor, Wright served as clerk of Queen Anne&#x27;s County, Maryland, in 1810, and was elected to the Eleventh and Twelfth Congresses to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Brown. He was re-elected to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Congresses and served from November 29, 1810, to March 3, 1817. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1816 to the Fifteenth Congress, but was elected to the Seventeenth Congress, serving from March 4, 1821, to March 3, 1823. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1822.

In his later life, Wright served as district judge of the lower Eastern Shore district of Maryland from 1823 until his death.

Wright owned slaves.

==Personal life==
Wright was married to Sarah De Courcy. Together, they were the parents of:

* William Henry De Courcy Wright (1795–1864), who married Eliza Lee (née Warner) Wright (1800–1864), the widow of Samuel Turbutt Wright, the 2nd Adjutant General of Maryland.

Wright died on September 7, 1826, at Blakeford in Queen Anne&#x27;s County. He is interred in the private burying ground of the DeCourcy family at Cheston-on-Wye in Queen Anne&#x27;s County.

<text>Matson, Inc., is an American shipping and navigation services company headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. Founded in 1882, Matson, Inc.&#x27;s subsidiary Matson Navigation Company provides ocean shipping services across the Pacific to Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Micronesia, the Pacific islands, China, and Japan.

==History==
William Matson (1849–1917) founded Matson Navigation Company. He was born in Lysekil in Västra Götaland County, Sweden, and orphaned during childhood. He arrived in San Francisco after a trip around Cape Horn in 1867. Working aboard the Dickel family yacht, he struck up a friendship with tycoon Claus Spreckels, who financed many of Matson&#x27;s new ships. In 1882, he sailed his three-masted schooner &quot;Emma Claudina&quot; into the Hilo Bay of the Hawaiian Islands.

The enterprise began in the carrying of merchandise, especially of plantation stores, to the islands and returning with cargoes of sugar, later expanding interests at each end of the line.

In 1924, Matson completed the Matson Building, designed by Bliss and Faville, at 215 Market Street in San Francisco, and noted as &quot;one of a series of Chicago School skyscrapers built during the 1910s and 1920s which give San Francisco its downtown character.&quot; It featured an observation tower and cupola at the northern corner of the building that enabled company executives to see its ships coming through the Golden Gate. The company later sold the building to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, whose general office was next door at 245 Market. PG&amp;E has incorporated the former Matson Building into its general office complex, keeping Matson-specific details such as elevator doors with detailed maps of Hawaii on them.

For a brief period after World War II, Matson operated an airline using Douglas DC-4 aircraft between the Pacific Coast and Hawaii. The airline ultimately ceased operations because of political pressure from Pan American World Airways, which resulted in inability to obtain federal government scheduled operating authority.

On December 1, 2011, Matson&#x27;s then-parent company Alexander &amp; Baldwin announced that its board of directors approved a plan to split A&amp;B and Matson into two separate companies. As part of the plan, Matson would leave Oakland, California, to become a Honolulu-based company. The two companies are now traded separately.

In 2015, Matson, Inc., acquired Horizon Lines, formerly its main competitor in the United States domestic market, for $469 million.

Joining two Aloha-class freighter sister ships delivered to Matson in 2018 and 2019; in November 2022, the company again contracted Philly Shipyard to build three new Jones Act compliant container ships at a cost of $1 billion.

==Passenger ships==
Primarily a conveyor of freight; from 1908 on, Matson introduced into service a number of passenger liners to capitalize on the burgeoning tourist trade. In 1926, following the death of its founder, John D. Spreckels whose father, Claus Spreckels, had been Matson&#x27;s earliest financier; Matson took over the Oceanic Steamship Company (Spreckels Line), operating three trans-Pacific liners, including the &quot;SS Sonoma&quot;.

From the early 20th century through the 1970s, Matson liners sailed from the west coast ports of San Francisco and Los Angeles to Honolulu and points beyond, including a handful of South Pacific ports of call as well as Sydney, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Two of their earlier cargo liners, and , were the first passenger ships to place their engines aft.

Among the &quot;white ships of Matson&quot; were &quot;Malolo&quot; (rechristened &quot;Matsonia&quot;), &quot;Lurline&quot;, &quot;Mariposa&quot;, and &quot;Monterey&quot;. With the advent and expansion of routine air travel between the mainland and the islands, Matson&#x27;s passenger service was greatly diminished, and the liners were eventually retired from trans-Pacific service and virtually gone by the end of the 1970s.

==Hotels==
In 1925, Matson acquired a controlling interest in the historic Moana Hotel on Waikiki on the island of Oahu. They constructed the nearby Royal Hawaiian Hotel in 1927. In 1952, they built the SurfRider Hotel (today a wing of the Moana), followed by the Princess Kaiulani Hotel in 1955. Matson sold the four properties to Sheraton Hotels in 1959.

<doc id="661497" wikidata="Q233928" url="?curid=661497" title="Leila Khaled">
<text>Leila Khaled ( ; born April 9, 1944) is a former Palestinian militant and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). She is famous as the first woman to hijack an airplane.

Khaled gained her prominence for her role in the TWA Flight 840 hijacking in 1969 and one of the four simultaneous Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings the following year as part of the campaign of Black September in Jordan. After being imprisoned, she was released in a prisoner exchange for civilian hostages kidnapped by other PFLP members.

==Early life==
Khaled was born on April 9, 1944, in Haifa, Mandatory Palestine, to Arab parents. Her family fled to Lebanon on April 13, 1948, as part of the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, leaving her father behind. At the age of 15, following in the footsteps of her brother, she joined the pan-Arab Arab Nationalist Movement, originally established in the late-1940s by George Habash, then a medical student at the American University of Beirut. The Palestinian branch of this movement became the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine after the 1967 Six-Day War.

Khaled spent some time teaching in Kuwait and, in her autobiography, recounted crying the day she heard that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated.

==The hijackings==
===TWA Flight 840 (1969)===
On August 29, 1969, Khaled was part of a team that hijacked TWA Flight 840 on its way from Rome to Tel Aviv, diverting the Boeing 707 to Damascus. According to some media sources, the PFLP leadership thought that Yitzhak Rabin, then Israeli ambassador to the United States, would be on board; he was not. She claims she ordered the pilot to fly over Haifa, so she could see her birthplace. No one was injured, but after the passengers disembarked, the hijackers blew up the nose section of the aircraft. After this hijacking, and a photograph of her (taken by Eddie Adams) holding an AK-47 rifle and wearing a kaffiyeh was reproduced in many publications, she underwent six plastic surgery operations on her nose and chin to conceal her identity and allow her to take part in a future hijacking, and because she did not want to wear the face of an icon.

===El Al Flight 219 (1970)===
On September 6, 1970, Khaled and Patrick Argüello, a Nicaraguan–American, attempted to hijack El Al Flight 219 from Amsterdam to New York City as part of the Dawson&#x27;s Field hijackings, a series of almost simultaneous hijackings carried out by the PFLP. Khaled and Argüello threatened to detonate grenades if they were not granted access to the cockpit. The pilots refused to comply, and instead put the plane into a nosedive. Though sources differ on the chronology of these events, in the resulting scuffle someone hit Argüello in the head with a bottle of whiskey; Argüello shot and injured a crew member and reportedly threw a grenade which did not explode towards the passengers; and sky marshals shot Argüello multiple times, mortally wounding him. The pilot diverted the aircraft to Heathrow Airport in London. An ambulance took the injured crew member and Argüello to the hospital. The crewmember survived while Argüello died in the ambulance. Khaled was arrested though later released during a hostage exchange. 

==Later life==

Khaled has stated in interviews that she developed a fondness for the United Kingdom when her first visitor in jail, an immigration officer, wanted to know why she had arrived in the country without a valid visa. She also developed a relationship with the two policewomen assigned to guard her in Ealing and later corresponded with them. Khaled continued to return to the UK for speaking engagements until as late as 2002, although she was refused a visa by the British embassy in 2005 to address a meeting at the Féile an Phobail in Belfast, where she was invited as a speaker. Eventually she managed to speak to people at the Belfast Féile through a video link.

According to Khaled, there is not an Arab-Israeli peace process. She stated &quot;it&#x27;s a political process where the balance of forces is for the Israelis and not for us. They have all the cards to play with and the Palestinians have nothing to depend on, especially when the PLO is not united.&quot; Khaled also supports the Kurdish political movement surrounding the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP) and drew attention to the similar fate of the Palestinian and the Kurdish people. She has become involved in politics, becoming a member of the Palestinian National Council and appearing regularly at the World Social Forum. 

She was married to physician Fayez Rashid (1950–2023) and lived with their two sons Bader and Bashar in Amman, Jordan. She is irreligious.

She was the subject of a film entitled &quot;Leila Khaled, Hijacker&quot;, directed by Palestinian filmmaker Lina Makboul. It premiered in November 2005 at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.

In November 2017, Khaled was refused entry to Rome, Italy at the Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, and was forced to return to Amman as she is a member of a group considered a terrorist organization by the Italian government.

In mid September 2020, Khaled was scheduled to speak at a virtual Zoom conference at San Francisco State University hosted by Rabab Abdulhadi and Tomomi Kinukawa. Following lobbying by the Jewish coalition group &quot;End Jewish Hatred,&quot; Zoom Video Communications along with YouTube and Facebook, prevented the conference from using their video conferencing software and platforms, citing compliance with U.S. export control, sanctions, and anti-terrorism laws.

==In popular culture==
* She was the subject of an artwork portrait made entirely out of lipsticks, &quot;The Icon&quot;, created by artist Amer Shomali using 14 colors, and 3,500 lipsticks.
* The song &quot;Like Leila Khaled Said&quot; from The Teardrop Explodes&#x27; 1981 album &quot;Wilder&quot; is a love song to Khaled. Songwriter Julian Cope said it was a love song to her &quot;cos I thought she was so beautiful. But I know that the whole thing was like bad news.&quot;
* The second CD of Julian Cope&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Psychedelic Revolution&quot; is named &quot;Phase of Leila Khaled&quot; while the first CD is named &quot;Phase of Che Guevara&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics contain several references to political demonstrations, terrorism and suicide bombers. The accompanying booklet also contains a photo of Leila Khaled.
* As of 2018, she is commemorated in a mural at the International Wall on the Falls Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland. The mural is based upon the photograph of her by Eddie Adams, holding an AK-47 and with the Palestine flag behind her. Her image along with an image of Irish Republican, Oglach Charlie Hughes says &quot;Our Struggle continues&quot;.
*The name of Sandton Drive in Johannesburg, South Africa was controversially changed to &quot;Leila Khaled Drive&quot; by vote of the city council on November 29, 2018. The American consulate in Johannesburg is located on the street. 
* The 10th song of the album &quot;Friværdi&quot;, released on September 26, 2005, by the Danish rock band Magtens Korridorer, is entitled &quot;Leila Khaled&quot;.
* Writer Chris Boucher has said that he named the character of savage warrior Leela from &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after Khaled.
* Khaled is mentioned by Fun-da-mental in &quot;Mother India&quot;, on the &quot;Love India&quot; CD (2010) widely distributed in the United States by Starbucks.
* The album &quot;Olive no Ki no Shita de&quot;, released in 2007 by the Japanese rock singer Panta, features a song entitled &quot;Leila&#x27;s Ballade&quot;. This song&#x27;s lyrics were written by former Japanese Red Army member Fusako Shigenobu and her daughter Mei Shigenobu. In 2012, Khaled was invited to a ceremony for the 40th anniversary of the Lod Airport massacre by a Japanese far-left group in Kyoto, at which Panta performed the song in front of Khaled.
*&quot;Leila Khaled: Hijacker&quot; is a 2006 documentary about Leila Khaled by Swedish-Palestinian filmmaker Lina Makboul.

<text>Folklore studies (also known as folkloristics, tradition studies or folk life studies in the UK) is the branch of anthropology devoted to the study of folklore. This term, along with its synonyms, gained currency in the 1950s to distinguish the academic study of traditional culture from the folklore artifacts themselves. It became established as a field across both Europe and North America, coordinating with (German), (Norwegian), and (Swedish), among others.

== Overview ==
A 1982 UNESCO document titled &quot;Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore&quot; declared a global need to establish provisions protecting folklore from varying dangers identified in the document. UNESCO further published the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2003. The American Folklife Preservation Act (P.L. 94-201) passed in 1976 by the United States Congress in conjunction with the Bicentennial Celebration included a definition of folklore, also called folklife:
&quot;...[Folklife] means the traditional expressive culture shared within the various groups in the United States: familial, ethnic, occupational, religious, regional; expressive culture includes a wide range of creative and symbolic forms such as custom, belief, technical skill, language, literature, art, architecture, music, play, dance, drama, ritual, pageantry, handicraft; these expressions are mainly learned orally, by imitation, or in performance, and are generally maintained without benefit of formal instruction or institutional direction.&quot; 
This law in conjunction with other legislation was designed to protect the natural and cultural heritage of the United States in alignment with efforts to promote and protect the cultural diversity of the United States and recognize it as a national strength and a resource worthy of protection.

The term &quot;folklore&quot; contains component parts &quot;folk&quot; and &quot;lore&quot;. The word &quot;folk&quot; originally applied to rural, frequently poor and illiterate peasants. A contemporary definition of &quot;folk&quot; is a social group which includes two or more persons with common traits, who express their shared identity through distinctive traditions. &quot;Folk is a flexible concept which can refer to a nation as in American folklore or to a single family.&quot; This expanded social definition of &quot;folk&quot; expands the material considered to be &quot;folklore artifacts&quot; to include &quot;things people make with words (verbal lore), things they make with their hands (material lore), and things they make with their actions (customary lore)&quot;. The folklorist studies the traditional artifacts of a group and the groups within which these customs, traditions and beliefs are transmitted.

Transmission of folk artifacts is necessary to their preservation over time outside of study by cultural archaeologist. Beliefs and customs are passed informally within a folk group mainly anonymously and in multiple variants. This is in contrast to high culture, characterized by recognition by the elites of a given society and identified as specific works created by individuals. 

The folklorist study the significance of these beliefs, customs and objects for the group. In folklore studies &quot;folklore &quot;means&quot; something – to the tale teller, to the song singer, to the fiddler, and to the audience or addressees&quot;. The field assumes cultural units would not be passed along unless they had some continued relevance within the group, though their meaning can shift and morph with time. 
Folklore is a naturally occurring and necessary component of any social group. Folklore does not need to be old; it continues through the modern day. It is created, transmitted, and used to establish &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; within a given group. The unique nature of a culture&#x27;s folklore requires the development of methods of study by the culture at hand for effective identification and research. As a modern academic discipline, folklore studies straddles the space between the social sciences and the humanities.

The study of folklore originated in Europe in the first half of the 19th century with a focus on the oral folklore of the rural peasant populations. The &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; of the Brothers Grimm, first published 1812, is the best known collection of the verbal folklore of the European peasantry. This interest in stories, sayings and songs, i.e. &quot;verbal lore&quot;, continued throughout the 19th century and aligned the fledgling discipline of folklore studies with literature and mythology. By the turn into the 20th century, European folklorists remained focused on the oral folklore of the homogeneous peasant populations in their regions, while the American folklorists, led by Franz Boas, chose to consider Native American cultures in their research, and included the totality of their customs and beliefs as folklore. This distinction aligned American folklore studies with cultural anthropology and ethnology. American folklorists thus used the same data collection techniques as these fields in their own field research. This the diverse alliance of folklore studies with other academic fields offers a variety of theoretical vantage points and research tools to the field of folklore studies even as it continues to be a point of discussion within the field.

Public folklore is a relatively new offshoot of folklore studies, starting after the Second World War and modeled on the work of Alan Lomax and Ben Botkin in the 1930s. Lomax and Botkin emphasized applied folklore, with modern public sector folklorists working to document, preserve and present the beliefs and customs of diverse cultural groups in their region. These positions are often affiliated with museums, libraries, arts organizations, public schools, historical societies, etc. The most renowned of these is the American Folklife Center at the Smithsonian, which hosts the Smithsonian Folklife Festival every summer in Washington, DC. Public folklore differentiates itself from the academic folklore supported by universities, in which collection, research and analysis are primary goals.

== Terminology ==
The field of folklore studies uses a wide-variety of sometimes synonymous terms. &quot;Folklore&quot; was the original term used in this discipline. Its synonym, &quot;folklife&quot;, came into circulation in the second half of the 20th century, at a time when some researchers felt that the term &quot;folklore&quot; was too closely tied exclusively to oral lore. The new term &quot;folklife&quot;, along with its synonym &quot;folk culture&quot;, is meant to include all aspects of a culture, not just the oral traditions. Folk process is used to describe the refinement and creative change of artifacts by community members within the folk tradition that defines the folk process. Professionals within this field, regardless of the other words they use, consider themselves to be folklorists.

Other terms which might be confused with folklore are popular culture and vernacular culture. However, pop culture tends to be in demand for a limited time, mass-produced and communicated using mass media. Individually, these tend to be labeled fads, and disappear as quickly as they appear. The term &quot;vernacular culture&quot; differs from folklore in its overriding emphasis on a specific locality or region. For example, vernacular architecture denotes the standard building form of a region, using the materials available and designed to address functional needs of the local economy. Folk architecture is a subset of this, in which the construction is not done by a professional architect or builder, but by an individual putting up a needed structure in the local style. Therefore, all folklore is vernacular culture, but not all vernacular culture necessarily folklore.

In addition to these terms, folklorism refers to &quot;material or stylistic elements of folklore [presented] in a context which is foreign to the original tradition.&quot; This definition, offered by the folklorist Hermann Bausinger, does not discount the validity of meaning expressed in these &quot;second hand&quot; traditions. Many Walt Disney films and products belong in this category of folklorism; fairy tales become animated film characters, stuffed animals and bed linens. These manifestations of folklore traditions have their own significance for their audience.

Fakelore refers to artifacts which might be termed &quot;pseudo-folklore&quot;, manufactured items claiming to be traditional. The folklorist Richard Dorson coined this word, clarifying it in his book &quot;Folklore and Fakelore&quot;. Current thinking within the discipline is that this term places undue emphasis on the origination of the artifact as a sign of authenticity of the tradition. Adjacently, the adjective &quot;folkloric&quot; is used to designate materials having the character of folklore or tradition, at the same time making no claim to authenticity.

== Methodology ==
There are several goals of active folklore research. The first objective is to identify tradition bearers within a social group and to collect their lore, preferably in situ. Once collected, these data need to be documented and preserved to enable further access and study. The documented lore is then available to be analyzed and interpreted by folklorists and other cultural historians, and can become the basis for studies of either individual customs or comparative studies. There are multiple venues, be they museums, journals or folk festivals to present the research results. The final step in this methodology involves advocating for these groups in their distinctiveness.

The specific tools needed by folklorists to do their research are manifold. 
* The researchers must be comfortable in fieldwork; going out to meet their informants where they live, work, and perform. 
* They need to access archives housing a vast array of unpublished folklore collections. 
* They will want work with folk museums, to both view the collections, and present their own findings. 
* Bibliographies maintained by libraries and on line contain an important trove of articles from around the world. 
* The use of indexes allow them to view and use the categorization of artifacts which have already been established. 
* All work by a folklorist must be appropriately annotated in order to provide identifiable sources of the work. 
* For all folklorists terminology becomes a skill to master as they rub elbows not only with related academic fields but also with the colloquial understanding (what exactly is a fairy tale?). This shared vocabulary, with varying and sometimes divergent shades of meaning, needs to be used thoughtfully and consistently. 
* The use of printed sources to locate and identify further variants of a folk tradition is a necessary adjunct to the field research. 
* Because the transmission of folk artifacts preceded and ignored the establishment of national and political boundaries, it is important to cultivate international connections to folklorists in neighboring countries and around the world to compare both the artifacts researched and the methodology used. 
* A knowledge of the history of folklore studies is called for to identify the direction and more importantly the biases which the field has taken in the past, enabling us to temper the current analysis with more impartiality.

The folklorist also rubs shoulders with researchers, tools and inquiries of neighboring fields: literature, anthropology, cultural history, linguistics, geography, musicology, sociology, psychology. This is just a partial list of the fields of study related to folklore studies, all of which are united by a common interest in subject matter.

== History ==

=== From antiquities to lore ===
It is well-documented that the term &quot;folklore&quot; was coined in 1846 by the Englishman William Thoms. He fabricated it for use in an article published in the August 22, 1846 issue of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;. Thoms consciously replaced the contemporary terminology of &quot;popular antiquities&quot; or &quot;popular literature&quot; with this new word. Folklore was to emphasize the study of a specific subset of the population: the rural, mostly illiterate peasantry. In his published call for help in documenting antiquities, Thoms was echoing scholars from across the European continent to collect artifacts of older, mostly oral cultural traditions still flourishing among the rural populace. In Germany the Brothers Grimm had first published their &quot;Kinder- und Hausmärchen&quot; in 1812. They continued throughout their lives to collect German folk tales to include in their collection. In Scandinavia, intellectuals were also searching for their authentic Teutonic roots and had labeled their studies &quot;Folkeminde&quot; (Danish) or &quot;Folkermimne&quot; (Norwegian). Throughout Europe and America, other early collectors of folklore were at work. Thomas Crofton Croker published fairy tales from southern Ireland and, together with his wife, documented keening and other Irish funeral customs. Elias Lönnrot is best known for his collection of epic Finnish poems published under the title Kalevala. John Fanning Watson in the United States published the &quot;Annals of Philadelphia&quot;.

With increasing industrialization, urbanization, and the rise in literacy throughout Europe in the 19th century, folklorists were concerned that the oral knowledge and beliefs, the lore of the rural folk would be lost. It was posited that the stories, beliefs and customs were surviving fragments of a cultural mythology of the region, pre-dating Christianity and rooted in pagan peoples and beliefs. This thinking goes in lockstep with the rise of nationalism across Europe. Some British folklorists, rather than lamenting or attempting to preserve rural or pre-industrial cultures, saw their work as a means of furthering industrialization, scientific rationalism, and disenchantment.

As the need to collect these vestiges of rural traditions became more compelling, the need to formalize this new field of cultural studies became apparent. The British &quot;Folklore Society&quot; was established in 1878 and the &quot;American Folklore Society&quot; was established a decade later. These were just two of a plethora of academic societies founded in the latter half of the 19th century by educated members of the emerging middle class. For literate, urban intellectuals and students of folklore the folk was someone else and the past was recognized as being something truly different. Folklore became a measure of the progress of society, how far we had moved forward into the industrial present and indeed removed ourselves from a past marked by poverty, illiteracy and superstition. The task of both the professional folklorist and the amateur at the turn of the 20th century was to collect and classify cultural artifacts from the pre-industrial rural areas, parallel to the drive in the life sciences to do the same for the natural world. &quot;Folk was a clear label to set materials apart from modern life…material specimens, which were meant to be classified in the natural history of civilization. Tales, originally dynamic and fluid, were given stability and concreteness by means of the printed page.&quot;

Viewed as fragments from a pre-literate culture, these stories and objects were collected without context to be displayed and studied in museums and anthologies, just as bones and potsherds were gathered for the life sciences. Kaarle Krohn and Antti Aarne were active collectors of folk poetry in Finland. The Scotsman Andrew Lang is known for his 25 volumes of Andrew Lang&#x27;s Fairy Books from around the world. Francis James Child was an American academic who collected English and Scottish popular ballads and their American variants, published as the Child Ballads. In the United States, Mark Twain was a charter member of the American Folklore Society. Both he and Washington Irving drew on folklore to write their stories. The 1825 novel &quot;Brother Jonathan&quot; by John Neal is recognized as the most extensive literary use of American folklore of its time.

=== Aarne–Thompson and the historic–geographic method ===
By the beginning of the 20th century these collections had grown to include artifacts from around the world and across several centuries. A system to organize and categorize them became necessary. Antti Aarne published a first classification system for folktales in 1910. It was later expanded into the Aarne–Thompson classification system by Stith Thompson and remains the standard classification system for European folktales and other types of oral literature. As the number of classified artifacts grew, similarities were noted in items which had been collected from very different geographic regions, ethnic groups and epochs.

In an effort to understand and explain the similarities found in tales from different locations, the Finnish folklorists Julius and Kaarle Krohne developed the Historical-Geographical method, also called the Finnish method. Using multiple variants of a tale, this investigative method attempted to work backwards in time and location to compile the original version from what they considered the incomplete fragments still in existence. This was the search for the &quot;Urform&quot;, which by definition was more complete and more &quot;authentic&quot; than the newer, more scattered versions. The historic-geographic method has been succinctly described as a &quot;quantitative mining of the resulting archive, and extraction of distribution patterns in time and space&quot;. It is based on the assumption that every text artifact is a variant of the original text. As a proponent of this method, Walter Anderson proposed additionally a Law of Self-Correction, i.e. a feedback mechanism which would keep the variants closer to the original form.

It was during the first decades of the 20th century that Folklore Studies in Europe and America began to diverge. The Europeans continued with their emphasis on oral traditions of the pre-literate peasant, and remained connected to literary scholarship within the universities. By this definition, folklore was completely based in the European cultural sphere; any social group that did not originate in Europe was to be studied by ethnologists and cultural anthropologists. In this light, some twenty-first century scholars have interpreted European folkloristics as an instrument of internal colonialism, in parallel with the imperialistic dimensions of early 20th century cultural anthropology and Orientalism. Unlike contemporary anthropology, however, many early European folklorists were themselves members of the prioritized groups that folkloristics was intended to study; for instance, Andrew Lang and James George Frazer were both themselves Scotsmen and studied rural folktales from towns near where they grew up.

In contrast to this, American folklorists, under the influence of the German-American Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict, sought to incorporate other cultural groups living in their region into the study of folklore. This included not only customs brought over by northern European immigrants, but also African Americans, Acadians of eastern Canada, Cajuns of Louisiana, Hispanics of the American southwest, and Native Americans. Not only were these distinct cultural groups all living in the same regions, but their proximity to each other caused their traditions and customs to intermingle. The lore of these distinct social groups, all of them Americans, was considered the bailiwick of American folklorists, and aligned American folklore studies more with ethnology than with literary studies.
=== Great Depression and the Federal Writers&#x27; Project ===
Then came the 1930s and the worldwide Great Depression. In the United States the Federal Writers&#x27; Project was established as part of the WPA. Its goal was to offer paid employment to thousands of unemployed writers by engaging them in various cultural projects around the country. These white collar workers were sent out as field workers to collect the oral folklore of their regions, including stories, songs, idioms and dialects. The most famous of these collections is the Slave Narrative Collection. The folklore collected under the auspices of the Federal Writers Project during these years continues to offer a goldmine of primary source materials for folklorists and other cultural historians.

As chairman of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project between 1938 and 1942, Benjamin A. Botkin supervised the work of these folklore field workers. Both Botkin and John Lomax were particularly influential during this time in expanding folklore collection techniques to include more detailing of the interview context. This was a significant move away from viewing the collected artifacts as isolated fragments, broken remnants of an incomplete pre-historic whole. Using these new interviewing techniques, the collected lore became embedded in and imbued with meaning within the framework of its contemporary practice. The emphasis moved from the lore to the folk, i.e. the groups and the people who gave this lore meaning within contemporary daily living.

=== German folklore in the Third Reich ===
In Europe during these same decades, folklore studies were drifting in a different direction. Throughout the 19th century folklore had been tied to romantic ideals of the soul of the people, in which folk tales and folksongs recounted the lives and exploits of ethnic folk heroes. Folklore chronicled the mythical origins of different peoples across Europe and established the beginnings of national pride. By the first decade of the 20th century there were scholarly societies as well as individual folklore positions within universities, academies, and museums. However, the study of German had yet to be defined as an academic discipline. 

In the 1920s this originally apolitical movement was coopted by nationalism in several European countries, including Germany, where it was absorbed into emerging Nazi ideology. The vocabulary of German such as (folk), (race), (tribe), and (heritage) were frequently referenced by the Nazi Party. Their expressed goal was to re-establish what they perceived as the former purity of the Germanic peoples of Europe. The German anti-Nazi philosopher Ernst Bloch was one of the main analysts and critics of this ideology. &quot;Nazi ideology presented racial purity as the means to heal the wounds of the suffering German state following World War I. Hitler painted the ethnic heterogeneity of Germany as a major reason for the country&#x27;s economic and political weakness, and he promised to restore a German realm based on a cleansed, and hence strong, German people. Racial or ethnic purity&quot; was the goal of the Nazis, intent on forging a Greater Germanic Reich.
In the postwar years, departments of folklore were established in multiple German universities. However an analysis of just how folklore studies supported the policies of the Third Reich did not begin until 20 years after World War II in West Germany. Particularly in the works of Hermann Bausinger and Wolfgang Emmerich in the 1960s, it was pointed out that the vocabulary current in was ideally suited for the kind of ideology that the National Socialists had built up. It was then another 20 years before convening the 1986 Munich conference on folklore and National Socialism. This continues to be a difficult and painful discussion within the German folklore community.

=== After World War II ===
Following World War II, the discussion continued about whether to align folklore studies with literature or ethnology. Within this discussion, many voices were actively trying to identify the optimal approach to take in the analysis of folklore artifacts. One major change had already been initiated by Franz Boas. Culture was no longer viewed in evolutionary terms; each culture has its own integrity and completeness, and was not progressing either toward wholeness or toward fragmentation. Individual artifacts must have meaning within the culture and for individuals themselves in order to assume cultural relevance and assure continued transmission. Because the European folklore movement had been primarily oriented toward oral traditions, a new term, &quot;folklife&quot;, was introduced to represent the full range of traditional culture. This included music, dance, storytelling, crafts, costume, foodways and more.

In this period, folklore came to refer to the event of doing something within a given context, for a specific audience, using artifacts as necessary props in the communication of traditions between individuals and within groups. Beginning in the 1970s, these new areas of folklore studies became articulated in performance studies, where traditional behaviors are evaluated and understood within the context of their performance. It is the meaning within the social group that becomes the focus for these folklorists, foremost among them Richard Baumann and Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett. Enclosing any performance is a framework which signals that the following is something outside of ordinary communication. For example, &quot;So, have you heard the one…&quot; automatically flags the following as a joke. A performance can take place either within a cultural group, re-iterating and re-enforcing the customs and beliefs of the group. Or it can be performance for an outside group, in which the first goal is to set the performers apart from the audience.

This analysis then goes beyond the artifact itself, be it dance, music or story-telling. It goes beyond the performers and their message. As part of performance studies, the audience becomes part of the performance. If any folklore performance strays too far from audience expectations, it will likely be brought back by means of a negative feedback loop at the next iteration. Both performer and audience are acting within the &quot;Twin Laws&quot; of folklore transmission, in which novelty and innovation is balanced by the conservative forces of the familiar. Even further, the presence of a folklore observer at a performance of any kind will influence the performance itself in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Because folklore is firstly an act of communication between parties, it is incomplete without inclusion of the reception in its analysis. The understanding of folklore performance as communication leads directly into modern linguistic theory and communication studies. Words both reflect and shape our worldview. Oral traditions, particularly in their stability over generations and even centuries, provide significant insight into the ways in which insiders of a culture see, understand, and express their responses to the world around them.
Three major approaches to folklore interpretation were developed during the second half of the 20th century. Structuralism in folklore studies attempts to define the structures underlying oral and customary folklore. Once classified, it was easy for structural folklorists to lose sight of the overarching issue: what are the characteristics which keep a form constant and relevant over multiple generations? Functionalism in folklore studies also came to the fore following World War II; as spokesman, William Bascom formulated the 4 functions of folklore. This approach takes a more top-down approach to understand how a specific form fits into and expresses meaning within the culture as a whole. A third method of folklore analysis, popular in the late 20th century, is the Psychoanalytic Interpretation, championed by Alan Dundes. His monographs, including a study of homoerotic subtext in American football and anal-erotic elements in German folklore, were not always appreciated and involved Dundes in several major folklore studies controversies during his career. True to each of these approaches, and any others one might want to employ (political, women&#x27;s issues, material culture, urban contexts, non-verbal text, ad infinitum), whichever perspective is chosen will spotlight some features and leave other characteristics in the shadows.

With the passage in 1976 of the American Folklife Preservation Act, folklore studies in the United States came of age. This legislation follows in the footsteps of other legislation designed to safeguard more tangible aspects of our national heritage worthy of protection. This law also marks a shift in our national awareness; it gives voice to the national understanding that diversity within the country is a unifying feature, not something that separates us. &quot;We no longer view cultural difference as a problem to be solved, but as a tremendous opportunity. In the diversity of American folklife we find a marketplace teeming with the exchange of traditional forms and cultural ideas, a rich resource for Americans&quot;. This diversity is celebrated annually at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival and many other folklife festivals around the country.

== Global folklore studies ==

=== Folklore studies and nationalism in Turkey ===

Folklore interest sparked in Turkey around the second half of the nineteenth century when the need to determine a national language came about. Their writings consisted of vocabulary and grammatical rule from the Arabic and Persian language. Although the Ottoman intellectuals were not affected by the communication gap, in 1839, the Tanzimat reform introduced a change to Ottoman literature. A new generation of writers with contact to the West, especially France, noticed the importance of literature and its role in the development of institutions. Following the models set by Westerners, the new generation of writers returned to Turkey bringing the ideologies of novels, short stories, plays and journalism with them. These new forms of literature were set to enlighten the people of Turkey, influencing political and social change within the country. However, the lack of understanding for the language of their writings limited their success in enacting change.

Using the language of the &quot;common people&quot; to create literature, influenced the Tanzimat writers to gain interest in folklore and folk literature. In 1859, writer Sinasi, wrote a play in simple enough language that it could be understood by the masses. He later produced a collection of four thousand proverbs. Many other poets and writers throughout the Turkish nation began to join in on the movement including Ahmet Midhat Efendi who composed short stories based on the proverbs written by Sinasi. These short stories, like many folk stories today, were intended to teach moral lessons to its readers.

=== Folklore studies in Chile ===

The study of folklore in Chile was developed in a systematic and pioneering way since the late 19th century. In the work of compiling the popular traditions of the Chilean people and of the original peoples, they stood out, not only in the study of national folklore, but also in Latin America. Ramón Laval, Julio Vicuña, Rodolfo Lenz, José Toribio Medina, Tomás Guevara, Félix de Augusta, and Aukanaw, among others, generated an important documentary and critical corpus around oral literature, autochthonous languages, regional dialects, and peasant and indigenous customs. They published, mainly during the first decades of the 20th century, linguistic and philological studies, dictionaries, comparative studies between the national folklores of Ibero-America, compilations of stories, poetry, and religious traditions. In 1909, at the initiative of Laval, Vicuña and Lenz, the Chilean Folklore Society was founded, the first of its kind in America. Two years later, it would merge with the recently created Chilean Society of History and Geography.

== 21st century == 
With the advent of the digital age, the question once again foregrounds itself concerning the relevance of folklore in this new century. Although the profession in folklore grows and the articles and books on folklore topics proliferate, the traditional role of the folklorist is indeed changing.

=== Globalization ===
The United States is known as a land of immigrants; with the exception of the first Indian nations, everyone originally came from somewhere else. Americans are proud of their cultural diversity. For folklorists, this country represents a trove of cultures rubbing elbows with each other, mixing and matching into exciting combinations as new generations come up. It is in the study of their folklife that we begin to understand the cultural patterns underlying the different ethnic groups. Language and customs provide a window into their view of reality. &quot;The study of varying worldviews among ethnic and national groups in America remains one of the most important unfinished tasks for folklorists and anthropologists.&quot;

Contrary to a widespread concern, we are not seeing a loss of diversity and increasing cultural homogenization across the land. In fact, critics of this theory point out that as different cultures mix, the cultural landscape becomes multifaceted with the intermingling of customs. People become aware of other cultures and pick and choose different items to adopt from each other. One noteworthy example of this is the Jewish Christmas Tree, a point of some contention among American Jews.

Public sector folklore was introduced into the American Folklore Society in the early 1970s. These public folklorists work in museums and cultural agencies to identify and document the diverse folk cultures and folk artists in their region. Beyond this, they provide performance venues for the artists, with the twin objectives of entertainment and education about different ethnic groups. Given the number of folk festivals held around the world, it becomes clear that the cultural multiplicity of a region is presented with pride and excitement. Public folklorists are increasingly being involved in economic and community development projects to elucidate and clarify differing world views of the social groups impacted by the projects.

=== Computerized databases and big data ===
Once folklore artifacts have been recorded on the World Wide Web, they can be collected in large electronic databases and even moved into collections of big data. This compels folklorists to find new ways to collect and curate these data. Along with these new challenges, electronic data collections provide the opportunity to ask different questions, and combine with other academic fields to explore new aspects of traditional culture. Computational humor is just one new field that has taken up the traditional oral forms of jokes and anecdotes for study, holding its first dedicated conference in 1996. This takes us beyond gathering and categorizing large joke collections. Scholars are using computers firstly to recognize jokes in context, and further to attempt to create jokes using artificial intelligence.

=== Binary thinking of the computer age ===
As we move forward in the digital age, the binary thinking of the 20th century structuralists remains an important tool in the folklorist&#x27;s toolbox. This does not mean that binary thinking was invented in recent times along with computers; only that we became aware of both the power and the limitations of the &quot;either/or&quot; construction. In folklore studies, the multiple binaries underlying much of the theoretical thinking have been identified – {dynamicism : conservatism}, {anecdote : myth}, {process : structure}, {performance : tradition}, {improvisation : repetition}, {variation : traditionalism}, {repetition : innovation}; not to overlook the original binary of the first folklorists: {traditional : modern} or {old : new}. Bauman re-iterates this thought pattern in claiming that at the core of all folklore is the dynamic tension between tradition and variation (or creativity). Noyes uses similar vocabulary to define [folk] group as &quot;the ongoing play and tension between, on the one hand, the fluid networks of relationship we constantly both produce and negotiate in everyday life and, on the other, the imagined communities we also create and enact but that serve as forces of stabilizing allegiance.&quot;

This thinking only becomes problematic in light of the theoretical work done on binary opposition, which exposes the values intrinsic to any binary pair. Typically, one of the two opposites assumes a role of dominance over the other. The categorization of binary oppositions is &quot;often value-laden and ethnocentric&quot;, imbuing them with illusory order and superficial meaning.

=== Linear and non-linear concepts of time ===
Another baseline of western thought has also been thrown into disarray in the recent past. In western culture, we live in a time of progress, moving forward from one moment to the next. The goal is to become better and better, culminating in perfection. In this model time is linear, with direct causality in the progression. &quot;You reap what you sow&quot;, &quot;A stitch in time saves nine&quot;, &quot;Alpha and omega&quot;, the Christian concept of an afterlife all exemplify a cultural understanding of time as linear and progressive. In folklore studies, going backwards in time was also a valid avenue of exploration. The goal of the early folklorists of the historic-geographic school was to reconstruct from fragments of folk tales the Urtext of the original mythic (pre-Christian) world view. When and where was an artifact documented? Those were the important questions posed by early folklorists in their collections. Armed with these data points, a grid pattern of time-space coordinates for artifacts could be plotted.

Awareness has grown that different cultures have different concepts of time (and space). In his study &quot;The American Indian Mind in a Linear World&quot;, Donald Fixico describes an alternate concept of time. &quot;Indian thinking&quot; involves &quot;&#x27;seeing&#x27; things from a perspective emphasizing that circles and cycles are central to world and that all things are related within the Universe.&quot; He then suggests that &quot;the concept of time for Indian people has been such a continuum that time becomes less relevant and the rotation of life or seasons of the year are stressed as important.&quot; In a more specific example, the folklorist Barre Toelken describes the Navajo as living in circular times, which is echoed and re-enforced in their sense of space, the traditional circular or multi-sided hogan. Lacking the European mechanistic devices of marking time (clocks, watches, calendars), they depended on the cycles of nature: sunrise to sunset, winter to summer. Their stories and histories are not marked by decades and centuries, but remain close in, as they circle around the constant rhythms of the natural world.

Within the last decades our time scale has expanded from unimaginably small (nanoseconds) to unimaginably large (deep time). In comparison, our working concept of time as {past : present : future} looks almost quaint. How do we map &quot;tradition&quot; into this multiplicity of time scales? Folklore studies has already acknowledged this in the study of traditions which are either done in an annual cycle of circular time (ex. Christmas, May Day), or in a life cycle of linear time (ex. baptisms, weddings, funerals). This needs to be expanded to other traditions of oral lore. For folk narrative is NOT a linear chain of isolated tellings, going from one single performance on our time-space grid to the next single performance. Instead it fits better into a non-linear system, where one performer varies the story from one telling to the next, and the performer&#x27;s understudy starts to tell the story, also varying each performance in response to multiple factors.

=== Cybernetics ===
Cybernetics was first developed in the 20th century; it investigates the functions and processes of systems. The goal in cybernetics is to identify and understand a system&#x27;s closed signaling loop, in which an action by the system generates a change in the environment, which in turn triggers feedback to the system and initiates a new action. The field has expanded from a focus on mechanistic and biological systems to an expanded recognition that these theoretical constructs can also be applied to many cultural and societal systems, including folklore. Once divorced from a model of tradition that works solely on a linear time scale (i.e. moving from one folklore performance to the next), we begin to ask different questions about how these folklore artifacts maintain themselves over generations and centuries.

The oral tradition of jokes as an example is found across all cultures, and is documented as early as 1600 B.C. Whereas the subject matter varies widely to reflect its cultural context, the form of the joke remains remarkably consistent. According to the theories of cybernetics and its secondary field of autopoiesis, this can be attributed to a closed loop auto-correction built into the system maintenance of oral folklore. Auto-correction in oral folklore was first articulated by the folklorist Walter Anderson in his monograph on the King and the Abbot published 1923. To explain the stability of the narrative, Anderson posited a “double redundancy”, in which the performer has heard the story from multiple other performers, and has himself performed it multiple times. This provides a feedback loop between repetitions at both levels to retain the essential elements of the tale, while at the same time allowing for the incorporation of new elements.

Another characteristic of cybernetics and autopoiesis is self-generation within a system. Once again looking to jokes, we find new jokes generated in response to events on a continuing basis. The folklorist Bill Ellis accessed internet humor message boards to observe in real time the creation of topical jokes following the 9/11 terrorist attack in the United States. &quot;Previous folklore research has been limited to collecting and documenting successful jokes, and only after they had emerged and come to folklorists&#x27; attention. Now, an Internet-enhanced collection creates a time machine, as it were, where we can observe what happens in the period before the risible moment, when attempts at humour are unsuccessful.&quot;, that is before they have successfully mapped into the traditional joke format.

Second-order cybernetics states that the system observer affects the systemic interplay; this interplay has long been recognized as problematic by folklorists. The act of observing and noting any folklore performance raises without exception the performance from an unconscious habitual acting within a group, to and for themselves, to a performance for an outsider. &quot;Naturally the researcher&#x27;s presence changes things, in the way that any new entrant to a social setting changes things. When people of different backgrounds, agendas, and resources interact, there are social risks, and where representation and publication are taking place, these risks are exacerbated...&quot;

<text>Clovis points are the characteristically fluted projectile points associated with the New World Clovis culture, a prehistoric Paleo-American culture. They are present in dense concentrations across much of North America and they are largely restricted to the north of South America. There are slight differences in points found in the Eastern United States bringing them to sometimes be called &quot;Clovis-like&quot;. Clovis points date to the Early Paleoindian period, with all known points dating from roughly 13,400–12,700 years ago (11,500 to 10,800 C14 years BP). As an example, Clovis remains at the Murry Springs Site date to around 12,900 calendar years ago (10,900 ± 50 C14 years BP). Clovis fluted points are named after the city of Clovis, New Mexico, where examples were first found in 1929 by Ridgely Whiteman.

A typical Clovis point is a medium to large lanceolate point with sharp edges, a third of an inch thick, one to two inches wide, and about long. Sides are parallel to convex, and exhibit careful pressure flaking along the blade edge. The broadest area is towards the base which is distinctly concave with concave grooves called &quot;flutes&quot; removed from one or, more commonly, both surfaces of the blade. The lower edges of the blade and base are ground to dull edges for hafting. There is debate about how Clovis points were used. Originally it was assumed that they were used in a thrusting spear. Later suggestions arose that the points had been used as throwing spears, either as is or with spear thrower (atlatl) which technically would be considered darts, or as a braced weapon (pike). It is also possible the points were used in the animal butchering process.
Around 10,000 years before present, a new type of fluted projectile point called Folsom appeared in archaeological deposits, and Clovis-style points disappeared from the continental United States. Most Folsom points are shorter in length than Clovis points and exhibit longer flutes and different pressure flaking patterns. This is particularly easy to see when comparing the unfinished preforms of Clovis and Folsom points. Analysis of radiocarbon dates suggests that the Haskett Projectile Point is contemporary with Clovis and Folsom points.

== Type description ==

Only a few recovered Clovis points are in their original condition. Most points were &quot;reworked&quot; to resharpen them or repair damage. This can make it difficult to identify which lithic tradition they come from.

Clovis type description:
*Clovis is a comparatively large and heavy bifacially flaked fluted lanceolate point, lenticular to near oval in cross-section with parallel to moderately convex lateral edges, a majority having the latter. 
*Maximum width is usually at or slightly below midpoint, frequently resulting in rather long sharp tips. 
*Bases are normally only slightly concave, the depth usually ranging from and arching completely across basal width. 
*Basal corners range from nearly square to slightly rounded without forming eared projections. 
*Length range is considerable, with a majority between .
*Maximum width range is , a majority near the former. 
*Maximum thickness range, .
*Normally fluted on both faces.
*Flutes are most often produced by multiple flake removals
*Length and quality of flutes is greatly variable, with length usually 30% to 50% of overall point length, and the majority near the former
*Base of flutes is often widened by subsequent removals of additional channel flakes or short wide flakes. 
*There is minimal post-fluting retouch of basal areas. 
*Overall flaking frequently irregular in both size and orientation, often including large facet remnants of early stage reduction processes
*There is very moderate evidence of pressure flaking
*Lower lateral and basal edges are smoothed by grinding, often resulting in slight tapering of base.
*Clovis points do not have recurved (fishtail) lateral edges, pronounced basal constrictions, or convex (Folsom-type) channel flake platform remnants.

Points generally weigh between roughly 25 grams and 35 grams.Specimens are known to have been made of flint, chert, jasper, chalcedony and other stone of conchoidal fracture. Clovis points can vary even at a single site. The eight points found at Naco, while otherwise similar, ranged in length from 2 to 4 inches. A study suggested that Clovis points east of the Mississippi river had more diversity/richness that those in the west.

== Distribution ==

Clovis points have been found over most of North America and, less commonly, as far south as Venezuela. One issue is that the sea level is now about 50 meters higher than in the Paleoindian period so any coastal sites would be underwater, which may be skewing the data. The widespread South American Fishtail or Fell projectile point style has been suggested to have derived from Clovis. Of the around 6000 points currently classified as Clovis found in the United States the majority were east of the Mississippi and especially in the Southeast. Some researchers suggest that many of the eastern points are misclassified and most real Clovis Points are found in the west. Significant Clovis find sites include:

*Anzick site in Montana
*Aubrey site in Texas
*Belson site
*Big Eddy Site in Missouri
*Blackwater Draw type site in New Mexico
*Colby site in Wyoming
*Dent site in Colorado
*Domebo Canyon in Oklahoma
*East Wenatchee Clovis Site in Washington
*El Fin del Mundo in Sonora, Mexico
*Gault site in Texas
*Page–Ladson in Florida
*Lehner Mammoth-Kill Site in Arizona
*Murray Springs Clovis Site in Arizona
*Naco Mammoth Kill Site in Arizona
*Paleo Crossing site in Ohio
*Ready site (aka Lincoln Hills site) in Illinois
*Shawnee-Minisink Site in Pennsylvania
*Simon site in Idaho
*Sloth Hole in Florida

Fraudulent Clovis points have also emerged on the open market, some with false documentation.

===Caches===

Clovis points, along with other stone and bone/ivory tools, have been identified in over two dozen artifact caches. These caches range from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and Northwest United States. While the Anzick cache is associated with a child burial, the majority of caches appear to represent anticipatory material storage at strategic locations on the Pleistocene landscape. In May 2008, a major Clovis cache, now called the Mahaffey Cache, was found in Boulder, Colorado, with 83 Clovis stone tools though no actual Clovis Points. The tools were found to have traces of horse and cameloid protein. They were dated to 13,000 to 13,500 YBP, a date confirmed by sediment layers in which the tools were found and the types of protein residues found on the artifacts. The Fenn cache is an important collection of 56 items of uncertain provenance but that was probably discovered in 1902 &quot;near the area where Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho meet&quot; and was acquired by Forrest Fenn in 1988.

There is current debate on whether &quot;assemblages&quot;, production debris typically found in Clovis sites (blade cores, large bifacial overface flakes, etc.) but without actual projectile points, actually date to the Clovis period or to later periods.

==Origins==

Whether Clovis toolmaking technology was developed in the Americas in response to megafauna hunting or originated through influences from elsewhere is an open question among archaeologists. Lithic antecedents of Clovis points have not been found in northeast Asia, from where the first human inhabitants of the Americas originated in the current consensus of archaeology. Some archaeologists have argued that similarities between points produced by the Solutrean culture in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe suggest that the technology was introduced by hunters traversing the Atlantic ice-shelf and suggests that some of the first American humans were European (the Solutrean hypothesis). However, this hypothesis is not well-accepted as other archaeologists have pointed out that Solutrean and Clovis lithic technologies are technologically distinct (e.g. a lack of distinctive flutes in Solutrean technology), there is no genetic evidence for European ancestry in Indigenous North Americans, and the proposed Solutrean migration route was likely unsuitable.

<text>In legal writing, a &#x27; (Latin &#x27;something that has been said&#x27;; plural &#x27;) is a statement made by a court. It may or may not be binding as a precedent.

== United States ==
In United States legal terminology, a &quot;dictum&quot; is a statement of opinion considered authoritative (although not binding), given the recognized authority of the person who pronounced it.

There are multiple subtypes of , although due to their overlapping nature, legal practitioners in the U.S. colloquially use to refer to any statement by a court the scope of which extends beyond the issue before the court. in this sense are not binding under the principle of , but tend to have a strong persuasive effect, by virtue of having been stated in an authoritative decision, or by an authoritative judge, or both. These subtypes include:
* : A personal or individual dictum that is expressed by the judge who delivers an opinion but that is not necessarily concurred in by the whole court and that is not essential to the disposition of the case.
* : an assertion that a person makes without being obligated to do so, or a court&#x27;s discussion of a point or question not raised by the record, or its suggestion of a rule not applicable in the case at bar.
* : an opinion by a court on a question that is directly involved, briefed, and argued by counsel, and even passed on by the court, but that is not essential to the decision.
* in Latin means &#x27;something said in passing&#x27;, and relates to a comment made while delivering a judicial opinion which is not necessary to the decision in the case and therefore not precedential (although it may be considered persuasive).
* : an unproved or dogmatic statement.

== England ==
In English law, a is any statement made as part of a judgment of a court. Thus the term includes stated incidentally, in passing (), that are not a necessary part of the rationale for the court&#x27;s decision (referred to as the ). English lawyers do not, as a rule, categorise more finely than into those that are and those that are not.

<text>Robert G. Wright Jr. is an FBI agent who has criticized the FBI&#x27;s counterterrorist activities in the 1990s, when he worked in the Chicago division on terrorists with links to the Middle East, especially on the issue of money laundering. Specifically, he worked on project Vulgar Betrayal, which allegedly implicated Yasin al-Qadi. He wrote a detailed book which the FBI prevented him from publishing with threats of criminal prosecution. He complained that &quot;FBI management intentionally and repeatedly thwarted and obstructed my attempts to launch a more comprehensive investigation to identify and neutralize terrorists.&quot;

Three months before the September 11 attacks, he wrote the following:
&quot;Knowing what I know, I can confidently say that until the investigative responsibilities for terrorism are removed from the FBI, I will not feel safe. The FBI has proven for the past decade it cannot identify and prevent acts of terrorism against the United States and citizens at home and abroad. Even worse, there is virtually no effort on the part of the FBI&#x27;s international terrorism unit to neutralize known and suspected terrorists residing within the United States.&quot;
After his revelations circa 2002–2003 he was demoted.

On May 6, 2009, Judge Gladys Kessler issued a ruling allowing Wright to publish his manuscript. Wright is focused on fighting the system of prepublication review and censorship of government employee writings.

Other FBI agents who supported Wright&#x27;s allegations were John Vincent and Barry Carmody.

<doc id="661528" wikidata="Q17004280" url="?curid=661528" title="Jacobellis v. Ohio">
<text>Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184 (1964), was a United States Supreme Court decision handed down in 1964 involving whether the state of Ohio could, consistent with the First Amendment, ban the showing of the Louis Malle film &quot;The Lovers&quot; (&quot;Les Amants&quot;), which the state had deemed obscene.

==Background==
Nico Jacobellis, manager of the Heights Art Theatre in the Coventry Village neighborhood of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, was charged with two counts of possessing and exhibiting an obscene film in [378 U.S. 184, 186] violation of Ohio Revised Code (1963 Supp.), convicted and ordered by a judge of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas to pay fines of $500 on the first count and $2,000 on the second (), or if the fines were not paid, to be incarcerated at the workhouse, for exhibiting the film. Jacobellis&#x27; conviction was upheld by the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of Ohio.

==Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the conviction by ruling that the film was not obscene and so was constitutionally protected. However, the Court could not agree as to a rationale, yielding four different opinions from the majority. No opinion, including the two dissenting ones, had the support of more than two justices. The decision was announced by William J. Brennan, but his opinion was joined only by Justice Arthur Goldberg.

Justice Hugo Black, joined by Justice William O. Douglas, reiterated his well-known view that the First Amendment does not permit censorship of any kind. Chief Justice Earl Warren, in dissent, decried the confused state of the Court&#x27;s obscenity jurisprudence and argued that Ohio&#x27;s action was consistent with the Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Roth v. United States&quot; and furthered important state interests. Justice John Marshall Harlan II also dissented; he believed that states should have &quot;wide, but not federally unrestricted&quot; power to ban obscene films.

The most famous opinion from &quot;Jacobellis&quot;, however, was Justice Potter Stewart&#x27;s concurrence, stating that the Constitution protected all obscenity except &quot;hard-core pornography&quot;. He wrote, &quot;I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But I know it when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that.&quot;

==Subsequent developments==
The Court&#x27;s obscenity jurisprudence would remain fragmented until 1973&#x27;s &quot;Miller v. California&quot;.

<text>The San Lucan skink (Plestiodon lagunensis) is a skink (a type of lizard) native to the Baja California Peninsula.

Together with the western skink (&quot;P. skiltonianus&quot;), Gilbert&#x27;s skink (&quot;P. gilberti&quot;), and the four-lined Asiatic skink (&quot;P. quadrilineatus&quot;), the San Lucan skink belongs to the so-called &quot;&quot;skiltonianus&quot; group&quot;. The exact taxonomy within this group is being questioned and may need revision following DNA analysis research.

The San Lucan skink occurs only on the southernmost tip of Baja California, in the mountains around La Paz. They tend to nest in the same areas as western skinks, and are visibly similar.

<doc id="661532" wikidata="Q6728373" url="?curid=661532" title="Madonna Della Strada">
<text>Madonna Della Strada or Santa Maria Della Strada (English: Our Lady of the Wayside or Saint Mary of the Good Road) is a painting of Mary, mother of Jesus at the Church of the Gesù in Rome, mother church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) religious order of the Catholic Church; it is a variation on the &quot;basilissa&quot; (imperial) type of icon.

The &quot;Madonna Della Strada&quot; is the patron saint of the Society of Jesus. The society&#x27;s founder, Ignatius of Loyola, was said to have been protected by the intercession of Mary during battle in his service as a soldier.

==History==
The name goes back to a shrine established in Rome in the 5th century by the Astalli family, originally known as the &quot;Madonna degli Astalli&quot;, at a crossroads along the ceremonial route of the popes. The 13th-14th century fresco (a wall painting done on damp plaster) was originally painted on the wall of Saint Mary of the Way in Rome, the church of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), given to Saint Ignatius by Pope Paul III in 1540.

In 1568, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese erected the Gesù Church of Rome, the mother church of the Jesuits, in place of the former church of Santa Maria della Strada. The fresco was moved there in 1575 to a side chapel where Jesuits pronounced their vows. Sometime in the 19th century, the image was transferred to canvas and affixed to a slate panel.

Pope Urban VIII granted a decree of Canonical Coronation towards the image. The coronation took place on August 15, 1638.
The icon is located between two altars, the first dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola, the second, the main altar of the Church, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.

The icon was restored in 2006, revealing at least two layers of previous paint, the original art being a fresco which had been detached from a wall and affixed to canvas.

==Legacy==
There is a &quot;Madonna Della Strada Chapel&quot; at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, at the University of Scranton in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and another at Zilber Hall, Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

The Madonna della Strada Chapel is located at the campus ministry center of Le Moyne College.

<text>Spatial Data Transfer Standard, or SDTS, is a standard used to describe earth-referenced spatial data. It was designed to easily transfer and use spatial data on different computer platforms. The FGDC has proposed to withdraw the standard. 

The USGS made an effort to promulgate the standard by making a large volume of data available at no cost and many companies supported the standard by writing translators to transform the data into different formats.

<doc id="661537" wikidata="Q7055081" url="?curid=661537" title="1921 North Dakota gubernatorial recall election">
<text>The 1921 North Dakota gubernatorial recall election was a recall election of North Dakota Governor Lynn Frazier in 1921. Frazier was the first U.S. governor ever successfully recalled from office; there would not be another successful recall of a governor until California Governor Gray Davis was recalled in 2003.

==Background==
The recall stemmed from the conflict between the socialist-leaning Nonpartisan League, of which Governor Frazier was a member, and the Independent Voters Association, a conservative and ‘pro-free market’ faction. Frazier and his party supported state ownership of industries, while the IVA opposed it. A dispute broke out specifically over government ownership of the Bank of North Dakota and State Mill and Elevator.

By September, the campaigners had been able to gather 73,000 names on petitions asking for the recall of Frazier, Attorney General William Lemke, and Commissioner of Agriculture John Hagan. These men made up the Industrial Commission, which acts as a board of directors for the state-owned entities. The date of the recall was set for October 28, 1921.

==Results==


In the October 28 vote, Ragnvald A. Nestos was elected as governor by a margin of 4,093. He was sworn in on November 23.

<doc id="661540" wikidata="Q6503680" url="?curid=661540" title="Lawn sign">
<text>Lawn signs (also known as yard signs, bandit signs and [[placard]]s, among other names) are small signs that can be placed on a street-facing lawn or elsewhere on a property to express the support for an election candidate, or political position, by the property owner (or sometimes to promote a business). They are popular in political campaigns in the United States and Canada.

==Placement==

Lawn signs are often also placed near polling places on election day, although in most jurisdictions, there are legal restrictions on campaigning within a certain distance from a voting facility. In most states, there are also restrictions on where these signs can be placed. There are some residential areas that have ordinances prohibiting any posting of yard signs.

The signs are typically placed close to the road for greater visibility. In most highways a sign may not be erected so that the part of the sign face nearest a highway is within five feet of the highway&#x27;s right of way line.

Signs come in various shapes and sizes, but are most often rectangular and between 12 and 40 inches on each side. They are usually produced in packages that include lawn sign wires since most of these lawn signs need to be placed on a grass or dirt surface.

==Types==
===H-frame===
A common type of yard sign frame is the &quot;H-frame&quot;. The wire frames usually have at least two tines that can be inserted into the flutes of corrugated plastic signs. The tines on the other end of the frame can be inserted into the ground. A single or double crossbar between the two tines adds strength and makes the entire frame one single unit. It also prevents the sign face from sliding down the tines.

===I-frame===
The I-frame is essentially an H-frame without a crossbar linking the two legs. Each leg may have an abutment that acts as a stop to prevent the sign from sliding down.

==Political importance==
Political scientist Mel Kahn states that lawn signs help build name recognition for candidates. Supposedly, each sign represents 6–10 votes for the candidate. However, veteran political organizers hate the task of handing out yard signs, because they believe that time spent on procuring and distributing yard signs could be better used on other voter registration and get out the vote operations. One randomized field trial found yard signs simply reminding people to vote were able to significantly increase overall voter turnout. A 2016 study found that lawn signs raise vote shares by slightly more than 1 percentage point and are &quot;on par with other low-tech campaign tactics such as direct mail that generate ... effects that tend to be small in magnitude&quot;.

In addition, it gives the requester a placebo effect of doing something substantive, while not actually volunteering to help their candidate. Critics charge that &quot;lawn signs don&#x27;t vote&quot; and dismiss their importance. Theft of lawn signs is treated like any other instance of petty theft, however, signs on the rights of way in many states are considered litter and can be picked up by anyone as a public service. On several occasions, citizens who removed lawn signs on the pretext of cleaning up the clutter and eliminating driver distraction were arrested, sparking a public controversy.

In 2010, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported on a then-new type of yard sign designed for improved effectiveness by being cut into shapes or people to deliver a political message. The article suggested that such signs could expose 25,000 drivers per day to messages at a low cost.

==Freedom of speech issues in the United States==

===Governments===
In the last forty years, there have been two landmark cases from the Supreme Court of the United States on the topic of sign ordinances. In &quot;City of Ladue v. Gilleo&quot; (1994), a resident of Ladue, Missouri, sued the city after being told by city officials she had to remove a sign from her upstairs window protesting the Gulf War. The city banned most signs within city limits but allowed the placement of for-sale signs on the lawn. The Court struck down the ordinance and held that municipal ordinances aimed to reduce visual clutter through the regulation of yard signs were inviolate of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution if the ordinance restricted free speech and could not pass strict scrutiny. Passing strict scrutiny, which requires that the law be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest, is an incredibly difficult standard to meet. Under the standard, ordinances are presumed to be unconstitutional.

The second landmark decision by the Supreme Court was &quot;Reed v. Town of Gilbert&quot; (2015). In &quot;Reed&quot;, the Court reviewed the constitutionality of a sign ordinance in Gilbert, Arizona, which regulated the manner signs could be displayed in public areas. The ordinance banned the display of outdoor signs without a permit. However, the ordinance included over twenty categorical exemptions. For instance, &quot;ideological&quot; signs could be placed in the zoning district for an indeterminate amount of time and &quot;political&quot; signs were allowed in the district for up to 60 days before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election. However, “temporary directional signs relating to a qualifying event&quot;, which directed &quot;pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby&quot; to events hosted by non-profit organizations, could only be displayed in the district twelve hours before the start of the event and had to be taken down an hour after the event. The size of the signs were also regulated depending on the category. The Court held that the signs were a content based regulation because it distinguished signs based on their topic. Under First Amendment jurisprudence, content based regulations receive strict scrutiny. The ordinance was struck down.

Despite these rulings, municipalities and state governments continue to pass unconstitutional sign ordinances which are periodically struck down by courts.
===Residential associations===
The yard sign protections laid out in &quot;Ladue&quot; and in &quot;Reed&quot; do not apply to many Americans because they live in a house or condominium with a restrictive covenant governed by a residential association. Such associations are legally considered private entities that are not governed by the First Amendment. Legal scholars have advocated for the associations to be considered state actors by the courts. Under the state action doctrine, if a private actor is delegated a public function by the state, the private actor is considered a state actor and therefore governed by the First Amendment. For a function to be a public function, it must be both traditionally and exclusively or near exclusively a state function. On the other hand, one scholar has argued that the associations are &quot;of a private nature&quot; because of the legal principles governing the whole arrangements. Such associations are created by &quot;private initiative, private money, private property and private law concepts&quot;, thus the associations should be able to enforce any restrictive covenant banning political signs.

The states of California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Wisconsin all protect the right of homeowners to display lawn signs and prohibit homeowners associations and similar organizations from regulating or banning them.

Kansas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia allow homeowners associations and similar organizations to limit or ban political lawn signs only if it is already written in the bylaws.

Arizona and Texas prohibit homeowners associations and similar organizations from banning lawn signs during or around an election.

<doc id="661543" wikidata="Q6886414" url="?curid=661543" title="Moanalua High School">
<text>Moanalua High School (also known as MoHS) is a public, co-educational college preparatory high school of the Hawaii State Department of Education, located in Honolulu CDP, City &amp; County of Honolulu, Hawaii.

Serving grades nine through twelve and established in 1972, Moanalua High School is located in suburban Salt Lake near Moanalua. Its first class graduated in 1975. The school is situated on an extinct volcano hillside overlooking downtown Honolulu at 2825 Ala Ilima Street. The campus boasts the copper sculpture &quot;Moanalua&quot; by Bumpei Akaji and the ceramic sculpture &quot;Silent Sounds&quot; by Shigeharu Yamada.

As of 2016 its attendance boundary includes Fort Shafter, the housing at Tripler Army Medical Center, and portions of the Aliamanu Military Reservation.

In May 2012 Tiffany Hill of &quot;Honolulu Magazine&quot; wrote that the school had &quot;high-caliber programs&quot; and a strong curriculum. Hill stated that some programs are &quot;nationally recognized&quot;. In 2004 James Gonser of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; wrote that the school had &quot;A reputation for success&quot;.

Moanalua High School underwent reaccreditation by Western Association of Schools and Colleges and has achieved the maximum accreditation term of six years, 2012-2018 and once again in 2019-2024.

Robin Martin heads the school as principal.

==Origins==
An &quot;ahupuaa&quot; in ancient Hawaii was a parcel of land that stretched from the mountain to the sea. The ahupuaa of Moanalua was the property of wealthy landowner Samuel M. Damon.

Previous to Damon&#x27;s ownership of the Salt Lake ahupuaa, the volcanic hillside on which Moanalua High School sits was used by native Hawaiians in the Hawaiian religion. As one of the highest points overlooking what would later become the city of Honolulu, the volcanic hillside was revered as a place where the faithful could be closer to the ancestral spirits and gods. It served as a sacred altar as late as the reign of King Kamehameha V. The volcanic hillside&#x27;s religious value was neglected during the urban development after statehood in 1959.

Moanalua High School adopted the menehune as their mascot. In Hawaiian mythology, the Menehune are said to be a people, sometimes described as dwarfs in size, who live in the deep forests and hidden valleys of the Hawaiian Islands, far from the eyes of normal humans. The menehune are believed to have a special relationship with the gods and credited with building dams, temples and other structures throughout the Hawaiian Islands.

==Admissions==
The school has an attendance zone. Additionally as of May 2012 the school admits about 500-600 students from outside of the attendance zone. A lottery is used to determine which out of boundary students are admitted. In 2004 Gonser wrote that the lottery process was &quot;nail-bitting&quot;.

==Curriculum==
In May 2012 the school had seven Advanced Placement (AP) classes.

The Career and Academic Planning (CAP) program oversees career education classes, each running for 35 minutes and with each student taking at least one each week. The school began this program in 1997.

The Comprehensive School Alienation Program (CSAP), as of May 2012, had about 180-240 students on an annual basis and is used to assist students having difficulty with coursework.

==Symbols==
Traditionally, the alma mater and anthem are sung during the presentation of the school&#x27;s flag — a blue crest in the center of a field of blue and trimmed at the edges with white. The school&#x27;s colors are royal blue and silver.

==Demographics==
In May 2012 the school had about 2,010 pupils. The students tend to have a higher socioeconomic profile.

The following table represents the number of enrolled students from the years 2003 to 2014.

As of the 2012 school year, the racial/ethnic composition was as follows:
* Asian/Pacific Islander: 61.0%
* White: 14.4%
* Native Hawaiian: 9.4%
* Black: 6.5%
* Hispanic: 3.3%
* American Indian: 0.5%

Moanalua High School serves the children of enlisted personnel and commissioned officers of the United States Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps and Navy. Students who are not military dependents are usually children of professionals living in the Salt Lake and Moanalua subdivisions, neighborhoods that have been classified as upper middle class.

Each graduating class averages 400 students. Approximately sixty percent become enrolled at four-year colleges and universities throughout the nation while thirty percent become enrolled at two-year colleges. Eight percent go straight to the workforce while four percent join the armed forces. About five percent enroll in technical schools while three percent are usually unsure of their post-graduation plans. Moanalua High School has many valedictorians each year, in comparison to the other schools of the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education. Many students graduate with the honor in a single class, with 20 in 1998.

==Academic performance==
In 2004 about 80% of the students graduating from Moanalua went to universities and colleges. That year Gonser wrote that the &quot;many success stories&quot; originate from the &quot;personal attention&quot; and &quot;choices&quot; provided by the school&#x27;s employees to the students.

==Sports==
With the absence of professional sports teams in Hawaii, the popularity of high school athletics is considerably high in the state. In 2004 the school had 50 sports offered. That year about 800 students participated in those sports.

In the year of Moanalua High School&#x27;s founding, its athletics department joined the Hawaii High School Athletics Association. It currently also competes in the Oahu Interscholastic Association, an athletic conference of public schools on the island of Oahu. Moanalua High School competes in air riflery, baseball, basketball, bowling, canoe paddling, volleyball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, judo, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field, wrestling and water polo.

The 240+ member program holds its own marching festival each year known as the Menehune Classic. It also competes in other annual competitions such as the Kamehameha Tournament of Bands, Mililani Trojan Band Fest, the Oahu Interscholastic Association (OIA) Festival, and the Rainbow Invitational. It usually marches in at least one parade each year, such as the Aloha Week parade, and is frequently invited to march in out-of-state parades such as the Tournament of Roses Parade.

The marching band traveled to Osaka, Japan, to march in the Osaka Midosuji Parade. In 2009, the band traveled to Arizona to participate in the Fiesta Bowl Parade.

The Moanalua High School Symphony Orchestra consists of hand-picked students from grades 9 to 12. The Symphony Orchestra was the first student orchestra to be invited to perform at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall in 1998. The Symphony Orchestra were invited to perform again on March 20, 2005 at the Isaac Stern Auditorium, receiving a standing ovation in which audience members reportedly yelled, &quot;Good job, Hawaii!&quot; Moanalua High School Symphony Orchestra performed at Carnegie Hall a 3rd time in 2013.

<doc id="661547" wikidata="Q1679889" url="?curid=661547" title="James A. Bayard (politician, born 1767)">
<text>James Asheton Bayard Sr. (July 28, 1767 – August 6, 1815) was an American lawyer and politician from Wilmington, Delaware. He was a member of the Federalist Party, who served as U.S. Representative from Delaware and U.S. Senator from Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Bayard was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, son of Dr. James Asheton Bayard and Ann Hodge. The Bayards descended from a sister of Dutch Director-General Petrus Stuyvesant and came to Bohemia Manor, Cecil County, Maryland in 1698. Bayard was also of French Huguenot and English ancestry as well. Upon the premature death of his parents, the younger James went to live with his uncle, Colonel John Bubenheim Bayard, in Philadelphia. He graduated from Princeton College in 1784, studied law under General Joseph Reed and Jared Ingersoll, was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1787, and began a practice in Wilmington, Delaware. Bayard married February 11, 1795, Ann or Nancy Bassett, the daughter of wealthy Delaware lawyer and U.S. Senator Richard Bassett. They had six children, Richard, Caroline, James Jr., Edward, Mary, and Henry M. and lived on the southwest corner of 3rd and French Street in Wilmington, where they owned slaves.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Bayard was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1796, and served there for three terms, from March 4, 1797, until March 3, 1803. While in the U.S. House, &quot;he was distinguished as an orator and constitutional lawyer and became a leader of the party in the house.&quot; He especially distinguished himself as one of the impeachment managers appointed in 1798 in the impeachment proceedings against William Blount, a U.S. Senator from Tennessee. Blount was accused of inciting the Creeks and Cherokees to help the British take New Orleans from the Spanish. While the U.S. House impeached him, under Bayard&#x27;s leadership, the United States Senate dropped the charges in 1799 on the grounds that no further action could be taken beyond his dismissal. This set an important precedent for the future with regard to the limitations on actions which could be taken by U.S. Congress against its members and former members.

Bayard also played an important part in the U.S. presidential election of 1800. With the vote tied in the Electoral College, it was a group of Federalists led by Bayard who broke the deadlock by agreeing to allow the election of Thomas Jefferson by the House of Representatives. When it seemed the Federalists were about to vote for Aaron Burr, Bayard is believed to have followed the advice of Alexander Hamilton and persuaded his Federalist colleagues to abstain from voting. It was also believed he struck a deal with the incoming Jefferson, to refrain from the wholesale removal of Federalists from appointed positions. The young Bayard enlisted Representative Samuel Smith (Maryland politician) to negotiate with Jefferson on Federalist control of the Philadelphia and Wilmington custom offices. Jefferson subsequently permitted the Federalist officeholders to retain their posts.

Just before John Adams left office as U.S. president he used the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1801 to make many &quot;midnight&quot; judicial appointments. Among those was Bayard&#x27;s father-in-law, Richard Bassett. Resigning as Governor of Delaware, Bassett accepted an appointment as a federal judge but soon was out of work when Jefferson had the act repealed. Bayard himself declined an appointment as Minister to France offered by President John Adams in 1801.

So effective was Bayard in opposing Jefferson&#x27;s administration that an all-out effort was made by the Democratic-Republicans to defeat him in his attempt at a fourth term in 1802. Caesar Augustus Rodney, nephew of the Revolutionary President of Delaware Caesar Rodney, defeated Bayard by 15 votes. However, two years later, in 1804, the result was reversed with Bayard besting Rodney. In the best Delaware tradition, the two remained friends throughout their electoral rivalry.

==U.S. Senate and Peace Commissioner==
Although re-elected to the U.S. House in 1804, Bayard never returned there, because before the term began, on November 13, 1804, he was elected by the Delaware General Assembly as U.S. Senator, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of William H. Wells. He began a term of his own the following March 1805, was reelected six years later in 1810, and served in the Senate until his resignation on March 3, 1813.

By his admission, it mattered little who represented Delaware, given the smallness of the state; if the two senators and one representative happened to be all Federalists, all the better, since the party was in a considerable minority by the decade of the 1800s. Like most of his party, Bayard opposed &quot;Mr. Madison&#x27;s War&quot; as the War of 1812 was sometimes scornfully called, but like the Democratic-Republicans, he was outraged at the British actions on the high seas and recognized the need for action. As the possibility of war became more likely, he urged caution, thinking of the lack of preparedness of the army and navy and especially of the vulnerability of coastal Delaware. On June 17, 1812, he was one of 13 senators to vote against declaring war on Britain. However, once the war began he and all Delaware Federalists wholeheartedly supported the war effort, avoiding the suspicion of treason earned by Federalists in New England.

Because of that support, he was the only Federalist appointed as one of the peace commissioners who eventually negotiated the Treaty of Ghent. Resigning his Senate seat, he went to Europe and played a major role in the negotiations that ended the War of 1812 when the treaty was signed in December 1814. John Quincy Adams, head of the American negotiating team, praised Bayard:Of the five members of the American mission, the Chevalier [Bayard] has the most perfect control of his temper, the most deliberate coolness; and it is the more meritorious because it is real self-command. His feelings are as quick and his spirits as high as those of any one among us, but he certainly has them more under government.Subsequently, President James Madison offered him an appointment as Minister to Russia, but Bayard declined, believing a Federalist could hardly represent a Democratic-Republican administration.

Bayard was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in July 1815. His disposition on membership is unknown, as no known correspondence confirms or denies his interest, and his death was only a few weeks after his election, and a few days after his return from Europe.

==Death and legacy==
After spending several months in Europe, Bayard returned home in the summer of 1815. During the trip, he developed an inflamed throat and became critically ill. He lived only five days after his return and died at Wilmington. He was originally buried on Bohemia Manor, in Cecil County, Maryland. In 1842 his remains were removed, along with those of his father-in-law, Richard Bassett, and reburied in the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington. Bayard was the father of two U.S. Senators, Richard H. Bayard and James A. Bayard Jr., grandfather of another, Thomas F. Bayard Sr. and great-grandfather of another, Thomas F. Bayard Jr.

He was sometimes known as &quot;The Chevalier&quot;, &quot;the Goliath of his Party&quot;, and &quot;High Priest of the Constitution&quot;.

==Almanac==
Elections were held on the first Tuesday of October. U.S. Representatives took office on March 4 and have a two-year term. The General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators for six years which also began on March 4. In this case, he was initially completing the existing term, the vacancy caused by the resignation of William H. Wells.

<text>Ganja (; ) is Azerbaijan&#x27;s third largest city, with a population of around 335,600. The city has been a historic and cultural center throughout most of its existence. It was the capital of the Ganja Khanate until 1804; after Qajar Iran ceded it to the Russian Empire following the Treaty of Gulistan in 1813, it became part of the administrative divisions of the Georgia Governorate, Georgia-Imeretia Governorate, Tiflis Governorate, and Elizavetpol Governorate. Following the dissolution of the Russian Empire and the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, it became a part of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, followed by Azerbaijan SSR, and, since 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan.

== Etymology ==

The name Ganja derives from the Persian word &quot;ganj&quot; (), meaning &quot;treasure&quot; or &quot;treasury&quot;. It was called &quot;Janza&quot; in Arabic sources and &quot;Gandzak&quot; in Armenian sources. The explanation that the city was named this after its founder discovered treasure nearby (see below) is considered a folk etymology. According to one view, the city may have been named after Ganzak, the pre-Muslim capital of Adurbadagan. The city was renamed &quot;Yelizavetpol&quot; () in 1813, when it was part of the Russian Empire. After its incorporation into the Soviet Union, it was initially renamed back to Ganja (&quot;Gyandzha&quot;) in 1924, but in 1935 the name was changed again to &quot;Kirovabad&quot; () in honor of the Soviet politician Sergei Kirov, a name which the city retained throughout most of the rest of the Soviet period. In 1989, during perestroika, the city regained its original name of Ganja (), which is known as &quot;Gyandzha&quot; (, ) in Russian, &quot;Gyanja&quot; () or &quot;Gandzak&quot; () in Armenian, and &quot;Ganjeh&quot; () in Persian.

== History ==

===Medieval era===
According to the anonymous medieval Arabic history &quot;Tarikh Bab al-abwab&quot;, the city of Ganja was founded in 859–60 by Muhammad ibn Khalid ibn Yazid ibn Mazyad, the Arab governor of the region during the reign of the caliph Al-Mutawakkil, and so-called because of a treasure unearthed there. According to the legend, the Arab governor had a dream where a voice told him that there was a treasure hidden under one of the three hills around the area where he camped. The voice told him to unearth it and use the money to found a city. He did so and informed the caliph about the money and the city. The caliph made Muhammad the hereditary governor of the city on the condition that he would give the money he found to the caliph. The foundation of the city by the Arabs in the 9th century is supported by the medieval Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi, who mentions that the city of Ganja was founded in 846–47 in the canton of Arshakashen by &quot;Mahmed son of Xałtʿ&quot; (i.e., Muhammad ibn Khalid). The 14th-century Persian historian Hamdallah Mustawfi instead claims that the city was founded in 659–60, when the Arab armies first arrived in the South Caucasus.

However, the Persian origin of Ganja&#x27;s name suggests that there was an older pre-Islamic town there. According to some sources, it changed hands between Persians, Khazars and Arabs even in the 7th century. The area in which Ganja is located was known as &quot;Arran&quot; from the 9th to 12th century; its urban population spoke mainly in the Persian language.

Historically an important city of the South Caucasus, Ganja has been part of the Sassanid Empire, Great Seljuk Empire, Kingdom of Georgia, Atabegs of Azerbaijan, Khwarezmid Empire, Il-Khans, Timurids, Qara Qoyunlu, Ak Koyunlu, the Safavid, the Afsharid, the Zand and the Qajar empires of Persia/Iran. Prior to the Iranian Zand and Qajar rule, following Nader Shah&#x27;s death, it was ruled locally for a few decades by the khans of the Ganja Khanate, who themselves were subordinate to the central rule in mainland Iran and were a branch of the Iranian Qajar family. Ganja is also the birthplace of the famous Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi.
The people of Ganja experienced a temporary cultural decline after an earthquake in 1139, when the city was taken by king Demetrius I of Georgia and its gates taken as trophies which is still kept in Georgia, and again after the Mongol invasion in 1231. The city was revived after the Safavids came to power in 1501 and incorporated all of Azerbaijan and beyond into their territories. The city came under brief occupation by the Ottomans between 1578–1606 and 1723–1735 during the prolonged Ottoman-Persian Wars, but nevertheless stayed under intermittent Iranian suzerainty from the earliest 16th century up to the course of the 19th century, when it was forcefully ceded to neighbouring Imperial Russia.

===16th–19th centuries and Russian conquest===

For a short period, Ganja was renamed Abbasabad by Shah Abbas after war against the Ottomans. He built a new city to the southwest of the old one, but the name changed back to Ganja during the time. During the Safavid rule, it was the capital of the Karabakh province. In 1747, Ganja became the center of the Ganja Khanate for a few decades following the death of Nader Shah, until the advent of the Iranian Zand and Qajar dynasties. The khans/dukes who de facto self-ruled the khanate, were subordinate to the central rule in mainland Iran and were from a branch of the Iranian Qajar family.

From the late 18th century, Russia actively started to increase its encroachments into Iranian and Turkish territory to the south. Following the annexation of eastern Georgia in 1801, Russia was now keen to conquer the rest of the Iranian possessions in the Caucasus. Russian expansion into the South Caucasus met particularly strong opposition in Ganja. In 1804, the Russians, led by General Pavel Tsitsianov, invaded and sacked Ganja, sparking the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813. Some western sources assert that &quot;the capture of the city was followed by a massacre of up to 3,000 inhabitants of Ganja by the Russians&quot;. They also claim that &quot;500 of them were slaughtered in a mosque where they had taken refuge, after an Armenian apprised the Russians that there might have been &#x27;Daghestani robbers&#x27; among them&quot;.

With their military superiority, the Russians were victorious in the Russo-Persian War of 1804–1813. By the Treaty of Gulistan that followed, Iran was forced to cede the Ganja Khanate to Russia. The Iranians briefly managed to oust the Russians from Ganja during the 1826 offensive during the Russo-Persian War of 1826–1828, but the resulting Treaty of Turkmenchay made its inclusion into the Russian Empire permanent. It was renamed &quot;Yelizavetpol&quot; () after the wife of Alexander I of Russia, Elizabeth, and in 1840 became the capital of the Elizavetpol uezd and later in 1868, the Elizavetpol Governorate. The Russian name of the city was rejected by the local Azerbaijanis, who continued call it &quot;Ganja&quot;.

===20th century===
Ganja—known then as Yelizavetpol—was one of the main sites of the Armenian–Tatar massacres of 1905–07. In 1918, Ganja became the temporary capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, at which point it was renamed Ganja again, until Baku was recaptured from the British-backed Centrocaspian Dictatorship. In April 1920, the Red Army occupied Azerbaijan. In May 1920, Ganja was the scene of an abortive anti-Soviet rebellion, during which the city was heavily damaged by fighting between the insurgents and the Red Army. In 1935, Joseph Stalin renamed the city Kirovabad after Sergei Kirov. In 1991, Azerbaijan re-established its independence, and the ancient name of the city was given back. For many years the 104th Guards Airborne Division of the Soviet Airborne Troops was based in the town.

In November 1988, the Kirovabad pogrom forced the local Armenian population to leave the city.

===21st century===


Reconstruction in the 21st century has led to dramatic changes in the city&#x27;s urban development, transforming the old Soviet city into a hub of high-rise, mixed-use buildings.

In 2008, Ganja Mausoleum Gates were built on the basis of sketches of ancient Ganja gates made by local master Ibrahim Osmanoğlu in 1063.

In 2020, during the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Ganja came under bombardment by Armenian armed forces several times, killing 32 civilians and injuring dozens more. On 11 October, a residential apartment block in Azerbaijan&#x27;s city of Ganja was destroyed overnight in an Armenian missile strike, killing 10 civilians and wounding 34 others. The Armenian MoD denied that this came from its territory, while Artsakh stated that Armenian forces had targeted and destroyed the Ganja military airbase on Ganja International Airport, which they alleged was used to bombard Artsakh&#x27;s capital Stepanakert and also stated that the Azerbaijani population were given warning to move away from military facilities to avoid collateral damage. Subsequently, both a correspondent reporting from the scene for a Russian media outlet and the airport director denied that the airport, which had not been operational since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had been shelled. On 17 October, 21 civilians were killed and more than 50 injured when an Armenian SCUD B ballistic missile hit a residential area in Ganja.

<text>Questionable Content (sometimes abbreviated as QC) is a slice-of-life webcomic written and illustrated by Jeph Jacques. It was launched in August 2003 and reached its 5,000th comic in March 2023. The plot originally centered on Marten Reed, an indie rock fan; his anthropomorphized personal computer Pintsize; and his roommate, Faye Whitaker. Over time Jacques has added a supporting cast of characters that includes employees of the local coffee shop, neighbors, and androids. &quot;QC&quot; storytelling style combines romantic melodrama, situational comedy, and sexual humor, while considering questions of relationships, sexuality, dealing with emotional trauma, and artificial intelligence and futurism.

==Background==

In 2003, Jacques worked at a local newspaper in Easthampton, Massachusetts answering telephones. According to Jacques, the large amount of free time and access to the Internet led him to read webcomics &quot;as something to do&quot;. Jacques stated, &quot;I&#x27;ve always been really interested in music, and indie rock specifically, and I never saw any other comics that dealt with that aspect of our culture. I felt like there was a niche there that would work.&quot; Jacques posted the first &quot;QC&quot; on August 1, 2003.

Jacques makes his living from &quot;QC&quot; merchandising, advertising and donations. By 2004, Jacques could support himself and his then-partner based on income from merchandise and advertising sales. Merchandise has included designing T-shirts for the characters in the comic to wear, then selling real T-shirts of the same design. The comic is also supported by donors through Patreon.

Jacques promoted the comic in a number of ways including joining Dayfree Press for some time, and starting a fake feud with Sam Logan, the creator of &quot;Sam and Fuzzy&quot;, trading insults while linking to each other&#x27;s comic. &quot;QC&quot; has also featured guest comics, often in exchange for Jacques writing a guest comic for the creator or for cross-promotion.

==Publication==
&quot;Questionable Content&quot; was originally updated twice a week, and was later bumped to three strips a week. In September 2004, Jacques left his day job to begin updating Monday through Friday.

According to Jacques in 2008, at one point he would have sought newspaper syndication for &quot;Questionable Content&quot;, but the thought no longer appealed to him because he does not want to surrender editorial freedom. The webcomic has been published in physical books; as of 2023, six volumes have been released, covering strips 1–1799. The first print collection features some of the earliest strips redrawn in Jacques art style at the time of the book; Jacques said this was because he did not have high-resolution copies of some old strips.

==Style==
Both the methods of storytelling and the artistic style of the strip have changed considerably since its inception. Originally, Jacques intended the strip to be about &quot;a depressed lonely guy and his robot&quot;, but the introduction of the female character Faye led to an increase in Jacques&#x27; ideas for the strip. Gradually, he decided he wanted to stop making indie rock jokes and focus more on the relationships between the characters, which had &quot;always been the most fun and interesting part.&quot;

Jacques spoke on the evolution of his art in an interview at ComixTalk in March 2006:
In strip #1040 in 2007, Jacques said that he used a Wacom Cintiq graphics tablet to draw his strips. In 2021, he tweeted that his software had been mainly Clip Studio Paint &quot;for years now,&quot; and that he only used Photoshop for final layout and some image editing In 2007, he cited Bill Watterson (&quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot;) and the webcomic &quot;Scary Go Round&quot; as his main influences.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
&quot;Questionable Content&quot; takes place in Northampton, Massachusetts. Frequent settings include an apartment shared by Marten, Faye and Pintsize; Coffee of Doom, Dora&#x27;s coffee shop, where Hannelore, Penelope, Cosette, Emily, and Dale work; and Smif College&#x27;s Williston Library where Marten is employed along with Tai and Claire. (The real Williston Library is at Mount Holyoke College; the public library in Easthampton, Jacques&#x27;s former residence, is also called the Williston Library.) The comic is mostly realistic with occasional bouts of absurdity, and action primarily focuses on banter between the characters, with slowly progressing plot developments. Due to the emphasis on inter-character dialogue, Jacques rarely uses thought bubbles in the comic.

Early in the comic&#x27;s run, the main drama arose from tension between Faye and Marten. The two were roommates and Marten was romantically interested in Faye, but barriers would keep the relationship from happening.

The comic appears to be set in a reality similar to our own, but with a futuristic twist. For instance, references to music and bands in various strips are current and relevant at the time of publication. On the other hand, the setting is filled with sentient, emotive artificial intelligences with individual personalities (referred to as &quot;AnthroPCs&quot; or &quot;AIs&quot;), which frequently interact with human characters as though they have been doing so for a significant amount of time. According to academic Rebecca Gibson, &quot;the differences between robots and humans in QC are treated in ways that minimalize conflict, maximize attempts at understanding, and address people as people, regardless of their organo-metallic content... While some have jobs, those jobs are either voluntarily done to maintain independence, or done to earn money for their own benefit. They have choice and autonomy and sentience, and while they are not treated as complete equals—there are plotlines about body purchases and upgrades, and what is wanted versus what can be afforded, as well as comments about personalities—they are, by and large, treated well.&quot; AIs can choose companionship and even sex. AIs can be just as good or as unpleasant as humans. Almost all bots have artificial skin color, such as blue, purple, and pink. Jacques remarked of the setting as far back as 2005:
AnthroPCs are the only consistent signs of advanced technology in the series; when other technological advances are referenced, they rarely get developed beyond one or two strips. For instance, some of the notable technological creations in &quot;QC&quot; are the Deathbot 9000; a Vespa scooter that transforms into a battle droid; humans living permanently in space, single-stage-to-orbit ramjet-powered spaceplanes, orbital defense satellites capable of conversation. The permanent human presence in space was elaborated on in a story arc set aboard the space station where Hannelore grew up.

The internal chronology of the strip is somewhat ambiguous; on January 13, 2006, Jacques stated on a LiveJournal fan community that he has &quot;never sat down and exactly tabulated,&quot; but he suspects the total amount of elapsed &quot;QC&quot; time at that point was &quot;no more than six months.&quot; In a Q&amp;A Tumblr post on January 23, 2012, Jacques estimated that it had been &quot;at least a couple years in comic-time since the strip started.&quot;

===Characters===
&quot;Questionable Content&quot; features a diverse group of characters, with an academic noting that &quot;the cast of characters contains many people of color, the various companion and working bots, a trans woman, a man with a bionic hand, [a] spider bot, a dominatrix, an autistic woman, a woman with obsessive compulsive disorder, and a station-controlling AI presence. In other words, Jacques has created a world that not only reflects the diversity of our own in terms of gender, sexuality, disability, mental health, and ethnicity, but has added and addressed issues of AI and robotics.&quot;
* Marten Reed was &quot;QC&quot; original main character and the first character introduced to the comic. An indie rock fan, he is a former self-described &quot;office bitch&quot; who now works as a library assistant. He is generally optimistic, laid-back, and altruistic when it comes to relationships. He has no pets, but owns an AnthroPC named Pintsize. Marten and Faye were roommates for almost all of the comic, but as of strip 5002, Marten has moved to Cubetown. As of strip 2807, he is dating library intern Claire.
* Pintsize is Marten&#x27;s companion bot and was the second character introduced in the comic&#x27;s inaugural strip. He is impish, mischievous, impulsive, and filthy-minded, alienating those he comes into contact with, has a massive database of porn, touches people’s butts without consent, and is in general unpleasant. He later buys a human-standard chassis, and realizes that his previous pranks and hijinks won&#x27;t be accepted by his friends while he is in this new body. However, his obsession with butts continues: in a later strip, #4750 titled &quot;Getting Her Up To Speed,&quot; Pintsize protests &quot;Hey, don&#x27;t lump me into the anti-analingus group!&quot; He especially enjoys harassing or pranking Faye, although his hijinks are usually brought to end by some form of punishment, such as dismemberment, replacement of body parts with other objects, or being stuffed with bird seed. He is often used for comic relief, throw-away gags, or punchlines. Even so, he continues to be a companion to Marten, originally serving as a sounding board during Marten&#x27;s more introspective moments.
*Faye Whitaker is Marten&#x27;s best friend. Having met him in strip 3, she moved in with him after she accidentally burned down her apartment. Prior to moving to Northampton, she witnessed her father&#x27;s suicide; in the first serious moment of the comic, Jacques devoted six strips to covering the subject, accompanied by a direct note to his audience. Faye is known for her quick wit, sharp tongue, and usually playful, but sometimes violent, physicality. For the majority of the comic, Faye worked alongside Dora at the Coffee of Doom, but was fired after Dora caught her being drunk at work. Faye then began working in an underground robot fighting ring where she developed a friendship and then a romantic relationship with one of the robots there, Bubbles, with whom she now runs Union Robotics, a robot repair shop.
* Dora Bianchi, Tai&#x27;s fiancée, is a bisexual former goth who owns and operates the coffee shop Coffee of Doom. Her first appearance was in strip 75. She and Marten used to date. In the past, she has struggled with a habit of hiding her personal problems, such as her self-claimed social anxiety or trust issues caused by previous relationships. In fact, it was the latter issue which led to her and Marten&#x27;s breakup. Tai and Dora declared their engagement in strip 3989.
* Hannelore Ellicott-Chatham (nicknamed Hanners) is Marten&#x27;s and Faye&#x27;s eccentric upstairs neighbor. She has a rather severe case of obsessive–compulsive disorder and is an insomniac. She now works for Coffee of Doom. Despite her pathological fastidiousness, Hannelore has five piercings in each ear. Her parents are both billionaires, but her mother paid little attention to her; she was raised by her father in a space station. She has an AnthroPC named Winslow whose appearance initially resembled an iPod Classic but has since upgraded to a more humanoid body type. Hannelore first appeared in comic 515.
* Tai Hubbert studied English at Smif College and is now Marten&#x27;s boss at the library. She is a lesbian with a very active and complicated love life and sports numerous tattoos on her arms. As her preferred genre of music is minimal techno, she also works as a DJ under the name Tai Fighter (an allusion to &quot;TIE fighter&quot;). Tai first appeared in comic 691 and is engaged to Dora.
* Marigold Farmer is an avid gamer. She is very introverted, despite having acknowledged her desire to be &quot;less of a shut-in&quot;, and at low points, she has shown a tendency to ignore personal hygiene. She is also obsessed with anime and manga and has a Japanese-style AnthroPC named Momo. She is in a relationship with Dale, who she initially interacted with as an antagonist on &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Her name is a pun on the practice of gold farming. She first appeared in strip number 1413.
* Dale (surname unknown) is a video game enthusiast, playing a large amount of &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. To support his mother and pay for his otherwise sedentary lifestyle, he worked &quot;a bunch of jobs&quot; including delivering pizzas, though he is now working at Coffee of Doom. He is often seen wearing an augmented reality device in the form of glasses, which for a brief period enabled him to see and converse with May, an imprisoned AI, who has since been released. He and Marigold are in a relationship.
* Claire Augustus is an intern at the Smif College library and an aspiring librarian, first appearing in comic 2203. Her younger brother is Clinton; the siblings resemble each other closely enough to sometimes be mistaken for twins. Claire is a trans woman, a fact that makes her self-conscious and causes her and Clinton to worry about her personal safety. Claire and Marten have been dating since strip 2807.
*Bubbles is a burgundy-colored former combat-bot. Her large size makes her seem intimidating, though she is naturally shy. Bubbles owns and runs a robot repair shop with her partner Faye.

==Recognition==
&quot;Questionable Content&quot; was used along with &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, &quot;Fetus-X&quot; and &quot;American Elf&quot; as an example of comics using the web to create &quot;an explosion of diverse genres and styles&quot; in Scott McCloud&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Making Comics&quot;. The comic has been used in the &quot;Create a Comic Project&quot;, a New Haven, Connecticut youth literacy program sponsored in part by Yale University.

&quot;Questionable Content&quot; was recognized several times by the Web Cartoonists&#x27; Choice Awards. It received at least one nomination every year from 2004 to 2008 (the last year the WCCA gave out awards), and won six awards including winning Outstanding Romantic Comic three years in a row.

Graduate student Dennis Kogel used &quot;Questionable Content&quot; as a case study as part of their 2013 MA thesis at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland. Kogel wrote that the comic has often changed styles, characters and themes over the years, and has done so without marking the beginning of episodes. Kogel wrote that &quot;QC&quot; had evolved over time into a very different work, &quot;staying the same in name only&quot;, arguing that it was difficult to see the &quot;crudely drawn&quot; and loose cartoon style of QC of 2005, the &quot;more manga styled&quot; &quot;QC&quot; of 2008 and the more experimental QC of 2012 as the same world and characters.

&quot;QC&#x27;s&quot; depiction of artificial intelligence is discussed in Rebecca Gibson&#x27;s 2020 book &quot;Desire in the Age of Robots and AI&quot;, specifically in chapters relating to robot sex and sexuality.

<text>Angela Perez Baraquio Grey (born June 1, 1976), known professionally by her birth name of Angela Perez Baraquio, is an American educator. She was crowned Miss America 2001 on October 14, 2000, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, becoming the first Asian American, first Filipino American, and first teacher ever to win the pageant.

A politically conservative, anti-abortion Catholic, Baraquio has been publicly active in supporting various Republican politicians and in speaking out against abortion. She is also an educator whose platform as Miss America was character education. Since 2004, Baraquio has co-hosted the Hawaiian television show &quot;Living Local with the Baraquios&quot;.

==Early life and education==

She is the eighth of ten children (sixth of seven girls) born to an immigrant couple from Pangasinan, Philippines. One of her sisters is Hawaiian media personality Bernadette Baraquio Hamada whose husband is Hawaiian conservative talk radio show host and columnist, Rick Hamada.

Baraquio graduated from Moanalua High School in June 1994 &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. After graduation, she attended the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa where she graduated in May 1999 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in elementary education with an emphasis on speech.

Baraquio earned her master&#x27;s degree in educational administration from the University of Hawaii in December 2004. During her year as Miss America in 2001, Baraquio&#x27;s platform was character education.

==Pageant participation==
Baraquio was Miss Hawaii 2000. Subsequently, she was crowned Miss America 2001 on October 14, 2000, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, becoming the first Asian American, first Filipino American, and first teacher ever to win the pageant.

She helped host the Miss America 2002 pageant.

She has appeared as a panelist on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Pageant School: Becoming Miss America&quot; and on the conservative talk show, &quot;Hannity&quot;, of the Fox News Channel.

==Career==
From August 1999 to June 2000, Baraquio was a faculty member at Holy Family Catholic Academy in the Salt Lake subdivision of Honolulu. She taught physical education, was athletic director and coached basketball, volleyball and track. Baraquio was also choir director of the historic St. Augustine Church in Waikiki.

In 2015 Baraquio was appointed principal of St. Anthony of Padua School in Gardena, California.

Baraquio has worked as a celebrity spokesperson for First Hawaiian Bank, First Hawaiian Center, and the Four Seasons hotel in Hawaii. Baraquio and her family live in Anaheim, California.

==Political views and activity==
In 2001, Baraquio participated as Miss America in the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., and was acknowledged by President George W. Bush in his remarks. Bush said, &quot;Angela, it&#x27;s wonderful to see you again. Thank you for your testimony and your beauty and your grace.&quot; In June 2006, President Bush appointed Baraquio to the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation, where she served until November 2008.

In 2003, Baraquio hosted a series of television shows for Governor Linda Lingle (R-Hawaii), called &quot;Talk Story with Your Administration&quot;, showcasing activities and individuals of the Lingle Administration.

She was one of Senator Sam Brownback&#x27;s (R-Kansas) earliest and most prominent supporters in the 2008 Republican presidential primary season. She formally joined the Brownback campaign December 14, 2006, and served on his presidential exploratory committee, where her main task was promoting the conservative Kansas senator in her native Hawaii. She said she was drawn to the senator&#x27;s strong opposition to abortion. Baraquio said, &quot;As a Catholic, I am proud to support this wonderful man who believes in the sanctity of every human life.&quot; On January 20, 2007, Baraquio introduced Brownback at his presidential campaign kick-off event in Kansas. In her remarks, Baraquio said Brownback &quot;is a man we can trust to take our values to the White House.&quot; Brownback withdrew from the presidential race on October 19, 2007, before any primary contests.

Baraquio remains active in speaking out against abortion. CMG Booking an agency which specializes in booking prominent conservative Catholics for public speaking engagements, books Baraquio for events.

<doc id="661557" wikidata="Q73588" url="?curid=661557" title="Four Ways to Forgiveness">
<text>Four Ways to Forgiveness is a collection of four short stories and novellas by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin. All four stories are set in the future and deal with the planets Yeowe and Werel, both members of the Ekumen, a collective of planets used by Le Guin as part of the background for many novels and short stories in her Hainish Cycle. In 2017 it was reissued in the second volume of &quot;Hainish Novels &amp; Stories&quot; and as an e-book, augmented with a fifth related story by Le Guin, as Five Ways to Forgiveness.

==Setting==

The stories in the book are set on two planets in a distant solar system, Werel and Yeowe, inhabited by humans placed there by the ancient Hainish. (This &#x27;Werel&#x27; is not the same as the world called Werel in Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Planet of Exile&quot; and &quot;City of Illusions&quot;.) Werel has a long history of institutional enslavement of its lighter-skinned ethnic groups by its darker-skinned ethnic groups (the latter&#x27;s derogatory term for the former is &quot;dusties&quot;). When the Ekumen recontacted the Werelians, the shock spurred one of the Werelian nations, Voe Deo, to develop a space program and settle the other inhabitable planet in the system, Yeowe, transporting a primarily slave population to do so. Eventually the slaves on Yeowe conducted a successful revolt and gained their independence, an event that occurred in the fairly recent past of the four stories. The nations of Werel are nervous that the &quot;assets&quot; on that planet might attempt the same thing for themselves.

==Contents==

#&quot;Betrayals&quot; – The story of Yoss, an elderly, retired science teacher who lived through Yeowe&#x27;s War of Liberation, and her neighbour Chief Abberkam, a disgraced leader from that war and an opponent of contact with the Ekumen, both living in a desolate area of the planet. Abberkam rescues Yoss&#x27;s pet cat from an accidental fire which destroys her hut; Yoss then moves into Abberkam&#x27;s house. 
#&quot;Forgiveness Day&quot; – Solly, a woman of half-Terran ancestry and space-travelling parents, faces problems as Envoy to the small sexually repressive kingdom of Gatay on Werel.
#&quot;A Man of the People&quot; – Havzhiva is a man who grows up on Hain, is educated there and then works for the Hainish embassy on Yeowe. It contains the most extensive description of Hain&#x27;s environment and culture in Le Guin&#x27;s work.
#&quot;A Woman&#x27;s Liberation&quot; – Rakam, a woman born as a slave on Werel, tells of her life and her growing self-awareness. Also published in the anthology &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Liberation: A Choice of Futures By and About Women&quot; (2001).
#&quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot; focuses on Esdardon Aya, also known as &#x27;Old Music&#x27;. It is set somewhat later in time than the other four stories. Le Guin writes, &quot;the character called Old Music began to tell me a fifth tale about the latter days of the civil war . . . I’m glad to see it joined to the others at last.&quot;

The last story, &quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot;, appears only in the volume &quot;Five Ways to Forgiveness&quot;, and not in &quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot;. That story was also published earlier, in the collection &quot;The Birthday of the World&quot;.

The book ends with &quot;Notes on Werel and Yeowe&quot;, giving details of the two planets and their solar system.

The second, third, fourth, and fifth stories have some characters in common. Havzhiva from story &quot;A Man of the People&quot; works for Solly from &quot;Forgiveness Day&quot;. He is also the lover of Rakam in &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Liberation&quot;, who is mentioned but not named in &quot;A Man of the People&quot;. Both of them know the character, Dr Yeron, and also Esdardon Aya, called &quot;Old Music&quot;, who is a minor character in &quot;Forgiveness Day&quot;, and the protagonist in &quot;Old Music and the Slave Women&quot;.

==Themes==

The common themes of the stories revolve around the concepts of freedom and slavery. For thousands of years, the dark-skinned &quot;owners&quot; of Werel held the light-skinned &quot;assets&quot; in slavery. However, in recent years, following the colonization of the second planet, Yeowe, things have begun to change on Werel. The Yeowans have gained freedom and are struggling to establish their own government and identity, and gain admittance into the Ekumen of worlds.

Gender relations are another area examined by the stories. In its initial years of settlement, only male slaves were transported to Yeowe, leading to a hypermasculine culture and formalized homosexual relationships among them, both of which had a strong impact on later gender relations on Yeowe. In the second story of the book, Solly associates with a Werelian member of a class of traditional transvestite entertainers, and the fourth story features Rakam reflecting on how her new experience of freedom from formal slavery is conditioned by her position as a woman in a still-sexist society.

==Publication history==

The collection was first published by Harper Paperbacks (a division of HarperCollins &quot;Publishers&quot;) in 1995. &quot;Betrayals&quot; first appeared in 1994 in &quot;Blue Motel&quot;. The others appeared in the science fiction magazine &quot;Asimov&#x27;s&quot; in 1994 and 1995.

&quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot; was published in 1995 in a leather-bound, signed edition by Easton Press, which described itself as releasing &quot;works of lasting meaning, beauty and importance.&quot;

&quot;Five Ways to Forgiveness&quot; was first published in 2017 as a Library of America eBook Classic. The Library of America included &quot;Five Ways to Forgiveness&quot; in the collection &quot;Hainish Novels &amp; Stories, Volume Two&quot; as well.

==Reception and critical analysis==

&quot;Four Ways to Forgiveness&quot; has been referred to as a story-suite by critics, based on Le Guin&#x27;s own use of the term to describe her deliberate inclusion of linked short stories in book form. Le Guin has remarked that the collections of stories could have been a novel had she focused on a few characters; instead she decided to focus on a work with many voices.

<text>William Sulzer (March 18, 1863 – November 6, 1941), nicknamed Plain Bill, was an American lawyer and politician. He was the 39th governor of New York serving for 10 months in 1913, and a long-serving U.S. representative from the same state. Sulzer was the first, and to date only, New York governor to be impeached and the only governor to be convicted on articles of impeachment. He broke with his sponsors at Tammany Hall, and they produced convincing evidence that Sulzer had falsified his sworn statement of campaign expenditures.

==Personal==
William Sulzer was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on March 18, 1863, the son of Lydia (Jelleme), who was Frisian, and Thomas Sulzer, a German immigrant. He was the second in a family of eight children, and his siblings included Charles August Sulzer, who pursued a successful political career in Alaska. He was reared on his family farm and attended the public schools of Elizabeth. At age 12 he left home and sailed as a cabin boy aboard a brig, the &quot;William H. Thompson.&quot; He returned to the family home a year later and became a clerk in a grocery store.

Sulzer took night classes at Cooper Union before attending lectures at Columbia Law School and studying law with the New York City firm of Parish &amp; Pendleton. He was admitted to the bar in 1884, and commenced practice in New York City. Even before beginning his law practice, he was a member of the Tammany Hall political machine serving as a popular stump speaker.

He married Clara Rodelheim in 1908.

==Career==

Sulzer&#x27;s career in politics began in 1884 when he worked for the Tammany Hall political machine on New York&#x27;s East Side as a stump speaker for various Democratic campaigns including the presidential campaign of then-Governor Grover Cleveland.

Sulzer was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1890, 1891, 1892 (all three New York Co., 14th D.), 1893 and 1894 (both New York Co., 10th D.). His participation in the machine helped assure that he was appointed to the Committee on General Laws in his first term. During his time in the Assembly he introduced bills seeking to abolish debtors&#x27; prisons, and to limit hours for workers. His popularity and loyalty to Tammany machine were such that in 1893, Tammany Boss Richard Croker selected Sulzer to be elected as Speaker of the New York State Assembly. The term was noted as being highly corrupt and highly partisan, as the Democratic machine dominated all committees, and with them the state budget. Sulzer himself declared during the term &quot;[A]ll legislation came from Tammany Hall and was dictated by that great statesmen, Richard Croker.&quot;

During his time in the Assembly, Sulzer was a delegate to the 1892 Democratic National Convention, and returned as such to every national convention until 1912.

==United States Congressman==

Sulzer was elected to the 54th United States Congress in 1894, and served as a U.S. Representative in the eight succeeding Congresses, from March 4, 1895, to December 31, 1912, representing the 10th Congressional District.

In Congress he was known for his oratory. Declaring himself to be a &quot;friend to all humanity and a champion of liberty&quot;, he supported the Cuban rebels during their War of Independence, and during the Second Boer War introduced a resolution supporting the Boer Republics and banning the sale of military supplies and munitions to the United Kingdom. Repeatedly he called for resolutions condemning Czarist Russia over the issue of pogroms. In the Sixty-second United States Congress he chaired the Committee on Foreign Affairs, from which he proposed a resolution praising the Revolution of 1911. He also opposed United States intervention in the Mexican Revolution, and proposed a unanimously supported bill to annul the Treaty of 1832 with Russia due to a Russian refusal to recognize the passports of Jewish-Americans.

Sulzer during his time in Congress supported numerous Progressive Era goals in terms of popular democracy and efficiency. He was a supporter of the creation of the United States Department of Labor, the direct election of senators --- for which he proposed a resolution in support of --- and the eight-hour day. In the Election of 1896 he supported the nomination of and campaigned for William Jennings Bryan.

In 1896, for the first time he announced his candidacy for the governorship but was rejected by Tammany and the Democratic Party at large. In 1898 Richard Croker openly opposed his attempt for the Democratic nomination. For the next six elections Sulzer was continually rejected for the Democratic nomination for governor, losing to Tammany supported politicians such as William Randolph Hearst and John Alden Dix.

In 1912, however, the split between the Republicans and the Progressives meant that the Democratic nominee was likely to win. This in turn prompted a fight in the Democrats, as reformers disappointed in Governor Dix&#x27;s support for Tammany moved to oust him from contention. The Empire State Democracy Party was even founded by reformers such as State Senator Franklin D. Roosevelt to run against Dix or any other clear Tammany candidate. In this crisis Sulzer found himself selected as a compromise candidate, acceptable to reform-minded and Tammany Democrats. With the party united, Sulzer went on to defeat Republican Job E. Hedges and Progressive Oscar S. Straus.

He resigned from Congress effective December 31, 1912, having been elected Governor of New York in November 1912 for the term beginning on January 1, 1913.

==Governor of New York==

Sulzer was elected with the support of William Jennings Bryan, William Randolph Hearst and Woodrow Wilson, as well as the reform and Tammany factions of the state Democratic Party. Upon taking office, a rift developed between Sulzer and Croker&#x27;s successor &quot;Silent Charlie&quot; Murphy, as Sulzer claimed control of the state Democratic Party, rather than staying loyal to Tammany.

===Attempts at reform===
On taking office as governor, Sulzer in an initial move announced the renaming of the Executive Mansion &quot;The People&#x27;s House&quot;. The populist rhetoric of this move was followed by a campaign to &quot;let the people rule&quot;, through a series of reforms, including a move to promote open primaries for party nominations, and investigations into corruption in the legislature and executive branches of state government. At the same time Sulzer refused to heed Tammany decisions for state appointments. These moves would damage the power of Tammany and other machines, Democratic and Republican throughout the state, and empower Sulzer. The campaign for direct primaries would win him the support of Theodore Roosevelt and his Progressives, but also moved Tammany to stand firmly against him.

Critics claimed that Sulzer was using the direct primary issue to build his own machine or to co-opt Tammany and assume control of it from Murphy, based on his populist appeal. Meanwhile, Sulzer and his supporters countered that the effort was necessary to promote fair government.

By the end of April, investigations against previously appointed Tammany officials had furthered the intraparty split. And then on the 26th as the Open Primaries Bill moved to a vote Sulzer declared &quot;If any Democrat in this State is against the Democratic State platform, that man is no true Democrat, and as the Democratic Governor of the State I shall do everything in my power to drive that recreant Democrat out of the Democratic Party.&quot; In spite of the threat, both Machine and Independent Democrats voted against the bill overwhelmingly. The Machine delegates, led by Speaker Al Smith followed the orders of Murphy, while the Independent Democrats, mostly from rural Upstate New York opposed the bill fearing that Open primaries would silence their influence and power against the weight of the urban vote.

Sulzer&#x27;s refusal to work with Tammany on appointments was a major threat to the organization, which had since its foundation been dependent on Civil Service work to develop its power. One of the appointments that Sulzer refused to make was that of James E. Gaffney, owner of the 1914 &quot;Miracle&quot; Braves, to State Commissioner of Highways.

Even after the defeat of the vote, Sulzer vowed to continue his fight with Murphy and the other bosses, and that there would be no compromise. In response, the Tammany-allied State Comptroller William Sohmer moved to freeze payrolls for state highway and prison projects, and the State Senate under the leadership of another Tammany officer Robert F. Wagner refused to approve the Governor&#x27;s appointments to the New York Public Service Commission.

===Impeachment===
As the conflict between Sulzer and Tammany moved on, accusations of perjury arose against the governor, stemming from an 1890 lawsuit accusing him of involvement in fraudulent companies in Cuba while a Congressman. It was also rumored that he was sued by a Philadelphia woman for breaking a 1903 promise to marry her. He rejected all these claims and characterized the breach of promise lawsuit as a &quot;frame-up.&quot;

In May 1913, the state legislature established a Joint Committee to investigate the financial conduct of state institutions, chaired by Senator James J. Frawley, a loyal Tammany Hall Democrat. In the summer of 1913 this committee, using Tammany-provided information, accused Sulzer of diverting campaign contributions to purchase stocks for himself and perjuring himself under oath. Sulzer and his supporters averred that the charges were made under instructions from Murphy in order to remove Sulzer as an obstacle to Tammany Hall. Some historians have corroborated Sulzer&#x27;s version of events. Sulzer also questioned the constitutionality of the committee itself. But as evidence emerged regarding his use of campaign funds, he began to lose the support of the national Democratic Party.

On August 11, 1913, the Frawley committee announced its findings to the state legislature, and moves began towards impeachment, managed by Tammany Hall&#x27;s legislative leaders, Al Smith and Robert Wagner. Sulzer&#x27;s only support came from Progressive legislators, who were too few to slow the process down. Over the next two days, Sulzer attempted to obstruct the impeachment at every turn but was powerless to stop it, as Smith and Wagner maintained control of their respective houses. In a last-minute attempt to prevent impeachment, the Governor&#x27;s wife admitted to having been responsible for the theft of campaign funds. The Governor&#x27;s allies attempted to postpone proceedings based on the new evidence, but were unsuccessful and the decision came to a vote.

On August 13, the New York Assembly voted to impeach Governor Sulzer by a vote of 79 to 45. Sulzer was served with a summons to appear before the New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments, and Lieutenant Governor Martin H. Glynn was empowered to act in his place pending the outcome of the trial. However, Sulzer maintained that the proceedings against him were unconstitutional and refused to hand over power to Glynn. Beginning August 21, Glynn began signing documents as &quot;Acting Governor&quot; despite Sulzer&#x27;s refusal.

On September 18, Sulzer&#x27;s impeachment trial before the Impeachment Court began in Albany. Sulzer called upon Louis Marshall to head his defense team; Marshall agreed but confided in his wife that he was not enthusiastic about the outcome. The trial did not go well; Sulzer did not even testify in his own defense. On the afternoon of October 16, the court convicted Sulzer on three of the Articles of Impeachment: filing a false report with the Secretary of State concerning his campaign contributions, committing perjury, and advising another person to commit perjury before an Assembly committee. The court voted to remove Sulzer from office. On October 17, 1913, Sulzer was removed by the same margin, a vote of 43–12, and Lt. Gov. Glynn succeeded to the governorship.

According to the 1914 book &quot;The Boss or the Governor&quot; by Samuel Bell Thomas, a crowd of 10,000 gathered outside the Executive Mansion on the night Governor Sulzer left Albany, leading to an exchange as follows:

:Mr. Sulzer: &quot;My friends, this is a stormy night. It is certainly very good of you to come here to bid Mrs. Sulzer and me good-bye.&quot;
:A voice from the crowd: &quot;You will come back, Bill, next year.&quot;
:Mr. Sulzer: &quot;You know why we are going away.&quot;
:A voice: &quot;Because you were too honest.&quot;
:Mr. Sulzer: &quot;I impeach the criminal conspirators, these looters and grafters, for stealing the taxpayers&#x27; money. That is what I never did.&quot;
:From the crowd: Cheers.
:Mr. Sulzer: &quot;Yes my friends, I know that the court of public opinion before long will reverse the judgement of Murphy&#x27;s &#x27;court of infamy.&#x27;&quot;
:From the crowd: Cheers.
:Mr. Sulzer: &quot;Posterity will do me justice. Time sets all things right. I shall be patient.&quot;
:From the crowd: Cheers.

Some in Albany maintained that he was impeached unfairly, as he had been the first person to have been impeached for acts committed before taking office. There have been several pieces of legislation introduced in the New York State Assembly and Senate to have his political record repaired. None have been successful to date.

==Later life and political career==

Sulzer was able to recover somewhat politically. Just a few weeks after the impeachment, he was elected on the Progressive ticket to the New York State Assembly, and was a member of the 137th New York State Legislature (New York Co., 6th D.) in 1914.

For the 1914 New York state election, he organized the American Party as a spoiler, to defeat Martin H. Glynn, his former lieutenant governor who had succeeded him as governor and was running for re-election. Sulzer also attempted to gain the Progressive Party nomination for governor, but was defeated in the primary, partly due to the intervention of Theodore Roosevelt who, in a letter to all members of the party, declared &quot;the trouble with Sulzer is that he does not tell the truth.&quot; However, Sulzer found support in the Prohibition Party which, on the basis of a speech he gave denouncing rum, nominated him for governor in 1914. He came in third, behind Republican Charles S. Whitman, who was elected governor, and Glynn, who was unseated. Sulzer thus claimed that the result was a moral victory, as the Democrats who had impeached him were swept out of power.

In the Election of 1916 Sulzer was the Presidential nominee of the American Party.

Leaving politics, he engaged in the practice of law in New York City. He wrote and spoke in support of the Baháʼí Faith from the 1920s occasionally after having met ʻAbdu&#x27;l-Bahá during his visit including the United States in 1912. He died in New York on November 6, 1941, aged 78. He was buried at the Evergreen Cemetery in Hillside, New Jersey.

==In popular culture==
&quot;The Great McGinty&quot;, Preston Sturges&#x27; 1940 film, was based in part on William Sulzer&#x27;s story, per film historian Kevin Brownlow.

&quot;Bitten by the Tiger: The True Story of Impeachment, the Governor &amp; Tammany Hall&quot; a 2013 book written by Jack O&#x27;Donnell and published by Chapel Hill Press, goes into depth about William Sulzer&#x27;s political rise, achievements, and his impeachment.

<text>Camp H. M. Smith is a United States Marine Corps installation in the Halawa census-designated place on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, near the community of Halawa (ha-LA-va) Heights. It is the headquarters of the United States Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM), Special Operations Command Pacific, and Marine Forces Pacific, the Marine service component command of INDOPACOM.

The camp, originally the Aiea Naval Hospital, was named for General Holland McTyeire Smith, the first commanding general of Fleet Marine Force Pacific, on June 8, 1955. The initials H. M. also stood for his nickname which was &quot;Howling Mad&quot; referring to his temper and given to him by his Marines.

== History ==
An Act of Congress on 17 March 1941 had approved purchase of the site, then a sugar cane field, for a Navy Hospital. In 1941, the investment for the 220½ acres of Camp Smith land, in fee simple (a term for owning both the land and the buildings), was $912,000, and improvements cost an additional $14 million. Work commenced in July and progressed slowly. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, construction of the planned 1,650-bed facility was rushed to completion. With Admiral Chester W. Nimitz in attendance, the hospital was commissioned on November 11, 1942, but continued expansion was necessary.

Throughout World War II, the Aiea Naval Hospital served as a stopping off place for thousands of wounded sailors and Marines on their way home from the war in the Pacific. Hospital activity peaked following the battle for Iwo Jima in February and March, 1945, when 5,676 patients received medical care simultaneously.

On June 1, 1949, the hospital was deactivated and Army and Navy medical facilities were consolidated at what is now the Tripler Army Medical Center. In 1950, the Territory of Hawaii began negotiations to obtain the Aiea facility for a tuberculosis sanitarium.

In 1955, however, the Marine Corps selected the site as the home of the Fleet Marine Force Pacific. The first Marines took up residence in October 1955; the headquarters staff placed the camp in full operation just two weeks before its dedication on January 31, 1956.

In October 1957, Camp Smith also became the headquarters for the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command, who formerly shared the headquarters of the Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet at Makalapa, near Pearl Harbor. Both commands were headed by the same officer until 13 January 1958, when a separate officer was named to serve as Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. In July 1992, FMFPac was further designated as the component command, Marine Forces Pacific. In April 1994, Marine Corps Base Hawaii assumed operational responsibility for Camp H. M. Smith.

Camp Smith today consists of at Camp Smith proper, at Puuloa Rifle Range in Ewa Beach, and in Manana Housing. Camp Smith is unique in that it is the only Marine Corps installation that supports a unified commander, Commander, Indo-Pacific Command (CDRUSINDOPACOM).

<text>Edward Wooster (c. 1622 in England – July 8, 1689) was an English early settler of Colonial America, and &quot;the first permanent settler in Derby&quot;, Connecticut.

In 1642, Wooster enters the record as one of the first colonists of Milford, Connecticut. In 1651, he received permission to settle an area known as &quot;Paugusset&quot;. In 1669, he was appointed constable of Paugusset. He served the settlement in a variety of ways, but earned the nickname (and a bounty from the town) as the &quot;wolf killer&quot; for helping to drive the predators out of the area. In 1659, he petitioned the court in New Haven for pay for the seven wolves he had killed in or near &quot;Paugassett&quot; which was what Derby was called at that point. Ironically, Wooster lived in the area at a time when the court in New Haven was still having concerns about the future of the area and considering possibly removing Wooster and anyone else in the area because of the failure to make progress on settling the area. 

Edward Wooster died on July 8, 1689. Wooster&#x27;s tombstone in Derby states:

: &quot; In memory of Edward Wooster 1622–1689 &quot;
: &quot; The first permanent settler in Derby — 1651 — &quot;
: &quot; &quot;The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them &quot;
: &quot; and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose&quot; &quot;

<text>Kaiapoi is a town in the Waimakariri District of the Canterbury region, in the South Island of New Zealand. The town is located approximately 17 kilometres north of central Christchurch, close to the mouth of the Waimakariri River. It is considered a satellite town of Christchurch and is part of the Christchurch functional urban area. The town is named after the nearby Kaiapoi Pā.

Kaiapoi suffered extensive damage in the 2010 Canterbury and also the February 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, which rendered many homes uninhabitable and businesses inoperable. Large areas were condemned as part of a residential red zone covering uninhabitable areas.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===

Kaiapoi is located on what was formally the south bank of the north branch of the Waimakariri River. This patch of land between the north and south branches of the Waimakariri was the largest island in the lower reaches of the river. &quot;Kaiapoi Island&quot; (as it was later called) was of spiritual and educational significance to Ngāi Tahu, who called it (&quot;the adornment of the deluded one&quot;). A stream that ran through the island, (also known as Courtenay Stream), was an important location for the ritual burial process of local Māori.

===Early settlement===
When the Christchurch settlement was planned, a secondary market town named &#x27;Mandeville&#x27; was proposed by Captain Joseph Thomas to support north-Canterbury farmers. Charles Torlesse surveyed the area in 1849 and on early maps it is marked to the south-west of modern-day Kaiapoi. The Canterbury Association ran out of money in 1850, and surveying work came to a stop before the town could be established. While the name of &#x27;Mandeville&#x27; stuck for the surveyed region, the area of the future township remained &#x27;Kaiapoi&#x27; due to the continued presence of Ngāi Tahu families in the area.

In 1851, Sir Thomas Tancred proposed a new settlement in Canterbury. He was concerned that the Canterbury Association had not made enough progress in establishing the promised Anglican model values in their new settlements. The name for this proposed settlement was to be &#x27;Gladstone&#x27;. Tancred wrote to Henry Sewell, asking him to instruct John Robert Godley to set aside land for the Gladstone settlers. By this stage in 1852 the Canterbury Association was not performing well financially, and was soon to wind-up and hand control to the newly-formed provincial government. Sewell forwarded the message, but Godley took no action to advance the plan. Thus, when the Gladstone settlers began arriving in 1853 they discovered no land had been set aside for them. The mouth of the Waimakariri River was suggested as a possible place for their new town, as much of that land had been set aside for the use of the church. An inspection party of settlers were joined by Sewell and surveyor Thomas Cass to explore the area. The group agreed on a location at the confluence of the north and south branches, close to where the proposed North Road met the river.

However, tensions flared the following day at a meeting between the settlers, Sewell, and Charles Simeon. An offer of of church land was made and agreed to, but the settlers had additional demands that could not be immediately met. After an argument, Sewell and Simeon decided to end the Gladstone scheme, as it was proving to be too much trouble. However, the suitability of the site was so great that Sewell began the work of establishing the town anyway, but rather under the direction of the Canterbury Association and not the Gladstone settlers. Soon of church land was marked off, and in 1853 Henry Cridland had laid out a map of the new settlement. By early 1854 the road to Kaiapoi was well-trodden, and the small settlement had begun to form.

Despite the collapse of the Gladstone scheme, many of the Gladstone settlers became established at Kaiapoi. Notable figures included the Reverend John Raven, who commissioned the first church in the area. The wooden building of St Bartholomew&#x27;s church was opened in 1856, to plans by Benjamin Mountfort. Today it is the oldest surviving church in Canterbury.

In 1857 Kaiapoi was declared a town by the provincial council.

===Rural hub===
Kaiapoi was an important hub for the early north Canterbury settlers, largely due to the river port that was established there. The mouth bar of the Waimakariri River posed a significant hazard to ships, and many ran aground. The river was also notorious for changing course and flooding unexpectedly. Despite this, the north branch of the river was navigable to Kaiapoi by small coastal shipping vessels. This port transported wool and wheat from the local farms to the major port at Lyttelton.

During the great storm of 1868 the Waimakariri flooded, destroying buildings, bridges, telegraph lines and port facilities. Later that same year, a tsunami triggered by an earthquake in Peru did further damage to the wharves.

The rail line from Christchurch to Kaiapoi opened in April 1872, beginning a decline in the use of Kaiapoi as a port. Coastal shipping did continue to be a major part of industrial transport in the area, however. Local businessman John Sims purchased coastal shipping vessels and expanded the wharf facilities at Kaiapoi during the 1870s and 80s. It was not until 1904 that the Kaiapoi Railway Station was opened.

The Kaiapoi Woollen Milling Company was established in the late 1870s. This business produced high-quality woollen blankets and clothing, and was successful during the 1880s in spite of the wider economic recession. It continued to be a major pillar of the local economy until its closure in the 1970s.

During World War I, a major slaughterhouse and freezing works was established in Kaiapoi. The facility processed sheep from across North Canterbury and remained an economic centre of the town until its closure in 1991. During the 1918 influenza pandemic seventeen people died of the disease, meaning that Kaiapoi had the second-highest death rate in North Canterbury, after Amberley.

The town was struck by two earthquakes in 1921 and 1922, and in 1923 the town experienced a major flood. This flood lead to a flurry of activity over the following decade to stabilise the course of the Waimakariri. Changes upstream of the town had the effect of reducing the flow of the North Branch of the river, and making it less prone to flooding. As it became effectively disconnected from the Waimakariri upstream of Kaiapoi, it was renamed to Kaiapoi River in 1959.

The 1920s saw a brief renewal of interest in the use of Kaiapoi as a port. This came in the context that both Kaiapoi and Lyttelton were at risk of losing port trade to Timaru. At one stage the Kaiapoi freezing works was sending frozen meat to Timaru for export. Despite local popular support for the port at Kaiapoi, several factors were working against it: the Waimakariri river bar still posed a significant hazard to ships; the course of the north branch of the river shifted so frequently that it was seen as unreliable for shipping vessels; the introduction of rail across the Southern Alps via the tunnel at Otira in 1923 made coastal shipping less necessary; and the river could not accommodate the trend towards larger more economical vessels for coastal shipping. All of these factors contributed to the decline of Kaiapoi as a trade port. Coastal shipping continued at Kaiapoi, with a brief increase after World War II. The port continued to bring in coal and dangerous goods even into the 1960s. In 1969 port activity was finally suspended.

The town&#x27;s war memorial records 20 local men as having died during World War II. The memorial, designed by William Trethewey, was first unveiled on Anzac Day in 1922 to commemorate the first world war. It was later updated after the second world war.

===2010 earthquakes===

The town suffered significant damage during the 2010 Canterbury earthquake. Ultimately, more than 900 homes in Kaiapoi and nearby The Pines Beach were ultimately abandoned due to the earthquake damage to the land. The earthquake caused enormous damage to infrastructure, interrupting the water supply and sewerage.

Many local buildings were damaged and demolished. The façade of the Blackwell&#x27;s Department Store was significantly damaged. It was demolished the same afternoon as the first earthquake to mitigate the safety risk during the ongoing aftershocks. The Kaiapoi Railway Station building was largely undamaged, though its foundation tilted dramatically. Rather than be demolished, the heritage building was moved to a safer location and later restored.

== Demographics ==
Kaiapoi is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The population experienced a large dip after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes, but has been growing rapidly, and is expected to continue to grow.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Kaiapoi had a population of 11,841 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,367 people (25.0%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,239 people (11.7%) since the 2006 census. There were 4,602 households, comprising 5,796 males and 6,051 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.96 males per female, with 2,022 people (17.1%) aged under 15 years, 2,217 (18.7%) aged 15 to 29, 5,178 (43.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 2,430 (20.5%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.1% European/Pākehā, 11.5% Māori, 2.3% Pasifika, 3.4% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 15.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 55.7% had no religion, 33.5% were Christian, 0.7% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,017 (10.4%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 2,544 (25.9%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,404 people (14.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,893 (49.8%) people were employed full-time, 1,440 (14.7%) were part-time, and 291 (3.0%) were unemployed.

== Commerce ==

Kaiapoi is also known as the &#x27;River Town&#x27; after the Kaiapoi River, a tributary of the Waimakariri River that flows through the centre of the town. This was originally the main arm of the Waimakariri River, but extensive flooding led to a diversion so the majority of the water travelled down the South arm of the Waimakariri.

Kaiapoi was well known for the woollen mill run by the Kaiapoi Woollen Manufacturing Company, and many woollen items produced at the mill can still be found throughout the world.

A freezing works (meat processing plant) was also a major employer in the town, and once this and the woollen mill had closed there was some economic turmoil in the town, and concern over its future. It, however, has survived and prospered, and although there is some local industry, a large percentage of the population works in the neighbouring city of Christchurch. One optimistic politician of the 1800s had even predicted that Kaiapoi would outsize its neighbour Christchurch. Kaiapoi is considered to be a satellite town of greater Christchurch, alongside Rolleston.

== Education ==

== Recreation ==
Outdoor recreation options include the Kaiapoi River which is deep enough for boating, with multiple accessible boat-ramps. There is a paddle-boat that offers pleasure cruises for tourists. The nearby Waimakariri River Regional Park is popular for kayaking, fishing, cycling and off-roading. Kaiapoi is also close to The Pines Beach.

The Waimakariri District Council operates several public recreation facilities in Kaiapoi including a library, museum, and a swimming pool. The Darnley Club provides community recreational opportunities for the elderly and the Chris Ruth Centre provides community recreational opportunities for adults with severe disabilities.

Kaiapoi is represented by both rugby codes. The &quot;Kaiapoi Rugby Football Club&quot; was established in 1883 and has its home ground at Kaiapoi Park. It competes in the Canterbury Rugby Football Union. The &quot;Kaiapoi Rugby League Club&quot; (now playing as the Northern Bulldogs) began in 1957 and play in the local Canterbury Rugby League. The club has been based at Murphy Park since 1960. In 2007 — the club&#x27;s jubilee 50th season — the Bulldogs won the Thacker Shield.
Kaiapoi is the location of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church, which is the oldest wooden church in the Anglican Diocese of Christchurch, built in 1855.

The dirt-surface Woodford Glen Speedway is only a short-distance south, between Kaiapoi and Kainga.

== Transport ==
State Highway 1 bypasses the town to the west via the Christchurch Northern Motorway. Prior to the completion of the motorway in December 1970, State Highway 1 ran down the main street of Kaiapoi. A half-hourly bus service connects Kaiapoi to Rangiora and central Christchurch.

The Main North Line railway runs through Kaiapoi, and the town once served as the junction for the Eyreton Branch, which provided rail access to communities west of Kaiapoi such as West Eyreton (though it ran to the north of Eyreton itself). This branch line opened in 1875 and closed fully by April 1965. The old station has a NZHPT Category II listing.

The river used to have a port before the construction of the Waimakariri River bridge, and was an important point for the transport of goods to and from Christchurch. Bucking the trend of river ports dying off in the middle of the 20th century, the port actually reopened for a decade between 1958 and 1967, to allow smaller ships to bypass the congested Lyttelton wharves.

<text>Moanalua is a valley, a stream, an ahupuaa, and a residential neighborhood in Honolulu, Hawaii. The valley extends inland from behind Āliapaakai crater (Salt Lake) to the crest of the Koʻolau Range.

Neighboring areas include Māpunapuna and Salt Lake on the south, Fort Shafter on the east, and Red Hill and Hālawa Valley on the west.

Moanalua is a part of the 15th District of the Hawaii Senate, currently represented by State Senator Glenn Wakai. It is also a part of the 32nd District of the Hawaii House of Representatives, currently represented by Linda Ichiyama.

==Location==
The Moanalua neighborhood includes a portion that extends up Ala Aolani Street into the valley , and another part that extends eastward along the lower slopes of the interfluve (slopes between valleys) to Fort Shafter and into the small valley of Manaiki Stream. The latter part includes Tripler Army Medical Center above the neighborhood and Moanalua Gardens below it.

== History ==
Samuel Mills Damon inherited the ahupuaa (uplands-to-sea tract) of Moanalua in 1884 from Ke Alii, Bernice Pauahi Bishop, whose husband Charles Reed Bishop was a business partner of Damon. Before her, since the lands were won in battle by Kamehameha I they passed from a number of figures, then to Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (who became King Kamehameha V), and then to Princess Ruth Keʻelikōlani after Kamehameha V&#x27;s passing.

Damon later became one of the first trustees of the Kamehameha Schools established by the Bishops. The Damon estate sold much of Moanalua to commercial and residential developers in 1956. Moanalua Elementary School was established in the area in 1884.

== Wai&#x27;apuka ==
* Wai&#x27;apuka, or Waipuka, is a series of three ponds which are a small part of Kamanaiki stream. It is a picturesque site, and the water comes from an underground artesian spring. There is also a Heiau further beyond the ponds. It was once considered a bathing grounds for Aliʻi.
* To get to the ponds there is a trail that takes about 15–30 minutes to hike located off of Onipa&#x27;a Street.
* Excerpt from &#x27;Sites of Oahu&#x27;: &quot;Up in the valley (Kamanaiki) are three streams called Wai-a-puka, seen with three pools; Pool one is a big one by its own hill side, pool two is a little smaller with its own hill side and pool three is still smaller. Your writer learned that this was where the chiefs bathed. The land before coming to it looked as though it was thickly populated for there were chiefs who ruled in this valley. This is proven by the stone walls that are still standing today (March 3, 1922).&quot;
* Excerpt from &#x27;Place Names of Hawaii&#x27;:
1. Kamana Nui - Moanalua Gardens (S. M. Damon Estate) The Western tributary of Moana-lua Valley, O&#x27;ahu. Lit., large Ka-mana

2. Kamana Iki - The eastern and smaller tributary of Moana-lua Valley, O&#x27;ahu. Lit., small Ka-mana.

3. Wai-puka - Pools near the mouth of Ka-mana Iki Valley, Moana-lua, O&#x27;ahu, where chiefs bathed after games and wrestling. Lit., issuing water.

== Moanalua Gardens ==

Moanalua Gardens are inland from the Interstate H-201 which is known as the Moanalua Freeway, off Exit 3. One of its monkey pod trees is seen on Hitachi&#x27;s Japanese TV commercials, and is occasionally referred to as in Japan.

The gardens were a gift to the public from Damon and maintained by a trust since his death in 1924. It was one of Hawaii&#x27;s earliest public parks although has remained privately owned.

<doc id="661577" wikidata="Q1113102" url="?curid=661577" title="The Grand Inquisitor">
<text>&quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; is a story within a story (called a poem by its fictional author) contained within Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s 1880 novel &quot;The Brothers Karamazov.&quot; It is recited by Ivan Fyodorovich Karamazov, during a conversation with his brother Alexei, a novice monk, about the possibility of a personal and benevolent God. &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot; is an important part of the novel and one of the best-known passages in modern literature because of its ideas about human nature and freedom. 

In a long diatribe directed at Jesus Himself, who has returned to Earth in Seville at the height of the Inquisition, the Grand Inquisitor defends the following ideas: only the principles of the devil can lead to mankind&#x27;s unification; give man bread, control his conscience, and rule the world; Jesus limited himself to a small group of chosen ones, while the Catholic Church improved on his work and addresses all people; the church rules the world in the name of God, but with the devil&#x27;s principles; Jesus was mistaken in holding man in high esteem. Jesus remains silent throughout the Inquisitor&#x27;s speech.

Scholars cite Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s play &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1787) as a major inspiration for Dostoevsky&#x27;s Grand Inquisitor, while also noting that &quot;The sources of the legend are extraordinarily varied and complex.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The tale is told by Ivan with brief interruptive questions by Alyosha. In the tale, Christ returns to Earth in Seville at the time of the Inquisition. He performs a number of miracles (echoing miracles from the Gospels). The people recognize him and adore him at the Seville Cathedral, but he is arrested by Inquisition leaders and sentenced to be burnt to death the next day. The Grand Inquisitor visits him in his cell to tell him that the Church no longer needs him. The main portion of the text is devoted to the Inquisitor explaining to Jesus why his return would interfere with the mission of the Church.

The Inquisitor founds his denunciation of Jesus on the three questions that Satan asked Jesus during the temptation of Christ in the desert. These three are the temptation to turn stones into bread, the temptation to cast Himself from the Temple and be saved by the angels, and the temptation to rule over all the kingdoms of the world. The Inquisitor states that Jesus rejected these three temptations in favor of freedom, but the Inquisitor thinks that Jesus has misjudged human nature. He does not believe that the vast majority of humanity can tolerate the freedom that Jesus has given to them. The Inquisitor thus implies that Jesus, in giving humans freedom to choose, has excluded the majority of humanity from redemption and doomed it to suffer.

Despite declaring the Inquisitor to be a nonbeliever, Ivan also has the Inquisitor saying that the Catholic Church follows &quot;the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction.&quot; He says: &quot;We are not with Thee, but with him, and that is our secret! For centuries have we abandoned Thee to follow him.&quot; For the Inquisitor, it is the Devil who provided the tools to end human suffering and unite humanity under the banner of the Church. With the church thus correctly organized, the multitude is guided by the few who are strong enough to take on the burden of freedom. The Inquisitor says that under him, all mankind will live and die happily in ignorance. Though he leads them only to &quot;death and destruction&quot;, they will be happy along the way, for he and his representatives in the church will relieve them of the terrible burden of freedom of conscience: &quot;The most agonizing secrets of their consciences – all, all will they bring to us, and we shall resolve it all, and they will attend our decision with joy, because it will deliver them from the great anxiety and fearsome torments of free and individual decision.&quot;

The Inquisitor advances this argument by explaining why Christ was wrong to reject each temptation by Satan. Christ should have turned stones into bread, as men will always follow those who will feed their bellies, and will also follow him who they see is capable of producing miracles. The Inquisitor recalls how Christ rejected this, saying &quot;man cannot live on bread alone&quot;, and explains to Christ: &quot;Feed men, and then ask of them virtue! That&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll write on the banner they&#x27;ll raise against Thee and with which they will destroy Thy temple.&quot; Casting himself down from the temple to be caught by angels would cement his godhood in the minds of people, who would follow him forever. Ruling over all the kingdoms of the Earth would ensure their salvation, the Grand Inquisitor claims.

The segment ends when Christ, who has remained silent throughout, kisses the Inquisitor on his &quot;bloodless, aged lips&quot;. The Inquisitor releases Christ but tells him never to return. Christ, still silent, leaves into &quot;the dark alleys of the city&quot;. Ivan concludes: &quot;The kiss burns in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea&quot;.

After relating the tale, Ivan asks Alyosha if he &quot;renounces&quot; Ivan for his views. Alyosha responds by giving Ivan a soft kiss on the lips, to which the delighted Ivan replies: &quot;That&#x27;s plagiarism... Thank you, though&quot;. The brothers part soon afterward.

==Background==
For Dostoevsky, the character of the Grand Inquisitor represents a prototypical expression of an ideology that denies Christ&#x27;s true spiritual and historical significance and affirms its opposite. The Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s anti-Christian philosophy is ironically accentuated by its appearance within an institutionally Christian context, but Dostoevsky identifies this same negation at the root of the socialist, nihilist and materialist doctrines of his contemporaries. In a letter to his publisher, he writes that Ivan, through the Grand Inquisitor, openly &quot;declares himself in favour of what the devil advocates&quot;. The Grand Inquisitor speaks the same doctrine as Russian socialism, except that the socialists would never admit it openly. Ivan, however, is &quot;a sincere person who comes right out and admits that he agrees with the Inquisitor&#x27;s view of humanity and that Christ&#x27;s faith elevated man to a much higher level than where he actually stands.&quot; For the socialists, according to Dostoevsky, Christ&#x27;s law is &quot;burdensome and abstract, too heavy for weak people to bear—and instead of the law of Freedom and Enlightenment, they offer them the law of chains and enslavement through bread.&quot; Dostoevsky&#x27;s notes contain passages that are more extreme than those eventually used. According to Edward Wasiolek, it is emphatically asserted in these notes that &quot;it is Christ who is guilty and cruel, and it is the Grand Inquisitor who is kind and innocent. It is Christ who demands that men suffer for Him, whereas the Grand Inquisitor suffers for men.&quot;

According to Joseph Frank, the prototype for the character of the Inquisitor can be found in Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlos&quot;: &quot;The play shares the same justification for the existence of evil in the world, the same answer to the problem of theodicy, that is at the heart of Dostoevsky&#x27;s legend.&quot;

==Significance within the novel==
Dostoevsky&#x27;s intention with &quot;The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor&quot; was to unmask the fundamental idea that lay behind the entire movement in Russia toward atheism, nihilism, rationalism and materialism, and away from the true Christian faith that was the spiritual heart of the nation. Within the novel as a whole, this idea is expressed most rigorously and eloquently through the character of Ivan Fyodorovich: the &#x27;poem&#x27; is Ivan&#x27;s composition, and the ideas, dogmas, assertions, suggestions and equivocations expressed in the Inquisitor&#x27;s monologue are the same ones at work within Ivan&#x27;s tormented intellect and personal struggle for faith and identity. Though the poem&#x27;s outward form is that of a monologue, a close analysis reveals its essentially dialogic nature, as an artistic representation of Ivan&#x27;s idea in its encounters with other voices, both in the world and within himself. According to Mikhail Bakhtin, detailed analysis of the Legend reveals a profound participation of all elements of Ivan&#x27;s worldview in his internal dialogue with himself and in his internally polemical interrelations with others. For all its external proportionality, the &quot;Legend&quot; is nevertheless full of interruptions; both the very form of its construction as The Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s dialogue with Christ and at the same time with himself, and, finally, the very unexpectedness and duality of its finale, indicate an internally dialogic disintegration at its very ideological core.

<doc id="661585" wikidata="Q1247655" url="?curid=661585" title="Pancake ice">
<text>Pancake ice is a form of sea ice that consists of round pieces of ice with diameters ranging from 30 centimetres (12 in) to 3 metres (9.8 ft) and thicknesses up to 10 centimetres (3.9 inches), depending on the local conditions. It forms as a result of wave action on slush or ice rind.

== Characteristics ==
Pancake ice features elevated rims formed by piling of frazil ice or slush onto the edges of pancakes when they collide, both due to random bumping into each other and because of periodic compressions at wave troughs. These rims are the first indication of the onset of the formation of the pancake ice from less consolidated forms of ice.

== Formation ==
Pancake ice forms in conditions of high wave activity, in contrast to other types of sea ice formed under calm conditions. Pancake ice can form in two processes: (1) on water covered to some degree in slush, shuga or grease ice, or (2) from breaking of ice rind, nilas or even gray ice in agitated conditions. If the waves are strong enough, pancakes can raft over each other, creating an uneven top and bottom surface on the ice. At this point, the pancake ice will fuse together and amalgamate into an ice floe. This ice floe will continue to grow over the winter. This process increases pancake ice&#x27;s resilience, resulting in characteristic length scales less than ocean wavelengths and causing waves passing through pancake ice not to scatter.

== Examples ==
=== Arctic Ocean ===
A notable example of pancake ice occurs in the Arctic Ocean, where a new prevalence of pancake ice is occurring, particularly along the ice edge, as a result of increasing Arctic wave activity.

<doc id="661590" wikidata="Q3419596" url="?curid=661590" title="Cascades Rapids">
<text>The Cascades Rapids (sometimes called Cascade Falls or Cascades of the Columbia) were an area of rapids along North America&#x27;s Columbia River, between the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. Through a stretch approximately wide, the river dropped about in .
These rapids or cascades, along with the many cascades along the Columbia River Gorge in this area of Oregon and Washington, gave rise to the name for the surrounding mountains: the Cascade Range.

In 1896 the Cascade Locks and Canal were constructed to bypass the rapids. In the late 1930s, the construction of the Bonneville Dam led to the submerging of the rapids and most of the 1896 structures.

==Fishing site==
The rapids were an important fishing site for Native Americans, who would catch salmon as they swam upriver to spawn.

==Obstacle on Oregon Trail==

They also posed a major obstacle to the development of the Oregon Trail; initially, pioneers would gather at The Dalles to await small boats to carry them to the Willamette Valley; in 1845, Sam Barlow and his associates built a road around the south side of Mount Hood, which allowed travelers along the Trail to bypass the rapids on the last leg of their journeys.

==Boat portage==
Boat travelers were required to either portage boats and supplies or pull boats up with ropes.

===Conflicts over portage rights===
Conflicts continued thereafter between the Chinookan natives and Europeans and Americans, who generally refused to recognize the natives&#x27; authority over passage through the area. By 1813–14, fur traders passing through were resorting to violent force against the Indians. Although more diplomatic approaches eventually prevailed, a malaria outbreak in the 1830s so reduced the populations of the Cascade and other Indian tribes, that they ceased to be a powerful force along the river.

However, three forts, Fort Cascades, Fort Raines and Fort Lugenbeel were constructed between present day Stevenson, Washington and North Bonneville over 1855–6 to protect the portage road around the rapids. Natives burned Fort Cascades in 1856, but it was rebuilt. This attack prompted the construction of Fort Lugenbeel.

==Steamboat navigation==

The Cascades were a significant barrier to river navigation. Steamboats could not go upriver through the rapids, and could be brought downriver only at great risk, although this was done a number of times by highly skilled captains. A canal and lock around the rapids was completed in 1896 at what is now Cascade Locks, Oregon. By 1938 the rapids were gone, submerged under the Bonneville Reservoir as it formed behind Bonneville Dam. Bonneville Lock at the dam, completed in 1937, replaced the old Cascade Locks around the rapids.

<doc id="661609" wikidata="Q6412224" url="?curid=661609" title="King of Dragon Pass">
<text>King of Dragon Pass is a 1999 strategy simulation fantasy video game published by A Sharp. Set in the fictional world of Glorantha, the player controls the fate of a barbarian clan settling in the dangerous frontier region of Dragon Pass.

Originally released for PC, the game was a commercial failure. It was ported for iOS in 2011, and was later released for Android and re-released for PCs. The iOS versions were much more commercially successful than the original PC release, leading to a sequel, &quot;Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind&quot;, being released in 2018.

== Plot ==
The player controls a clan of Orlanthi (worshipers of the Storm God Orlanth) across several generations. Orlanthi clans bear some similarities to the Iron Age Nordic peoples, such as lawspeakers, fyrds, the worship of a thunder god and a reliance on raiding, as well as Bronze Age Celtic and Italic peoples aesthetically, with the appearance of many of the tribesmen reflecting these origins.

At the beginning of the game the clan has fled its home of Heortland after a foreign magician known as Belintar or &#x27;the Pharaoh&#x27; usurps the throne. Along with dozens of other Orlanthi clans, the clan seeks to build a new home in Dragon Pass, a previously populated area left deserted after the Dragonkill War hundreds of years ago. With the Orlanthi clans variously feuding, allying, trading with and raiding each other, and a host of inhuman presences such as elves, dwarves and trolls, Dragon Pass is a free but dangerous frontier society compared to the tyrannical rule of the Pharaoh in Heortland. To the west, a persistent danger is the &#x27;Horse-Spawn,&#x27; a society of nomadic mounted warriors.

As time passes by the clans form into &#x27;tribes,&#x27; loose confederations of half a dozen clans. A prophet visits the player&#x27;s clan to inform them of a great destiny. The player must guide the clan through seven heroquests (ritual re-enactments of feats of the gods) and successfully manage a number of events, including co-operating with other clans to build a town and making peace with the Horse-Spawn by marrying their queen (or, if the player&#x27;s chieftain is female, their king). If the player is successful, the clan&#x27;s chieftain unites the Orlanthi tribes and the Horse-Spawn into a kingdom, becoming King of Dragon Pass.

== Gameplay ==
The player controls the seven-member clan ring leading the clan, providing leadership to the clan in all aspects of its life, such as trading, warfare, agriculture and diplomacy. The player can make two macro-level decisions per each of the five seasons in the Gloranthan year. Random events are drawn from a pool of hundreds, ranging from mundane law disputes to spiritual or demonic incursions. They are often influenced by previous decisions and outcomes. In battle, the player determines the goals and preparations, and possibly chooses the actions of his nobles at pivotal moments.

To succeed, a player must balance the various needs of survival and prospering, as well as manage the problems presented by the setting or the clan individuals - a lack of food might be solvable by clearing more farmland, but when the forest responds by sending a talking fox to urge leaving the trees alone, a wrong choice could bring the clan hunters to war with their environment. Likewise, should a member of the clan act in a selfish and foolish manner, action needs to be taken to stabilize and defuse the situation, if necessary.

&quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; contains no animation, instead depicting people and events with hand-drawn artwork. The game has elements of strategy, construction and management simulation, and role-playing video games.

== Production and release ==
&quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; was conceived and developed by David Dunham, using his friend Greg Stafford&#x27;s setting of Glorantha. At peak development, the A Sharp production team consisted of 12 people. The game cost $500,000 to make but only sold 8,000 boxed copies, rendering it a commercial failure. It sold disproportionately well in Finland thanks to a glowing review in Pelit.

&quot;King of Dragon Pass&quot; had initially been conceived for the Apple Newton. Following Apple&#x27;s announcement of the iPhone in 2007, Dunham was drawn back to the potential of the game for a handheld platform, and an updated version of the game was released for iOS on September 8, 2011. This version was updated to be a universal iOS app for compatibility with the iPad on September 6, 2012. The original Windows version was re-released by GOG.com in 2012. Dunham announced in March 2013 that the iOS version had sold 30,000 copies.

HeroCraft ported the iOS version to Android and released it on August 12, 2014. A Windows Phone version, also by HeroCraft, was released a month later on September 23. A new PC version based on the Android version was released July 29, 2015; it runs on Windows or Mac OS X.

== Sequel ==
A sequel, &quot;Six Ages: Ride Like The Wind&quot;, was announced in 2014, released for iOS on June 28, 2018, and PC and Mac in 2019. A second sequel, &quot;Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out&quot;, was released for PC, Mac, and iOS in 2023.

== Reception ==
The game&#x27;s hand painted watercolor artwork won the Best Visual Art prize in the 2000 Independent Games Festival. &quot;Rock, Paper, Shotgun&quot; described the game in retrospective in 2017 as &quot;a management game, yes, but at its heart is an ongoing RPG chronicle.&quot; In 2016, the game placed 5th on Rock Paper Shotgun&#x27;s The 50 best strategy games on PC list. Reviewing the iPhone version at &quot;TouchArcade&quot;, Eli Hodapp described it as &quot;one of the most in-depth and strategic gameplay experiences I&#x27;ve had so far on my iPhone,&quot; describing the game as a conglomeration of &quot;Civilization&quot; and &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot;.

<doc id="661622" wikidata="Q4175034" url="?curid=661622" title="Legislator">
<text>A legislator, or lawmaker, is a person who writes and passes laws, especially someone who is a member of a legislature. Legislators are often elected by the people, but they can be appointed, or hereditary. Legislatures may be supra-national (for example, the European Parliament), national, such as the Japanese Diet, sub-national as in provinces, or local.

== Overview ==
The political theory of the separation of powers requires legislators to be independent individuals from the members of the executive and the judiciary. Certain political systems adhere to this principle, others do not. In the United Kingdom and other countries using the Westminster system, for example, the executive is formed almost exclusively from legislators (members of the parliament), and the executive Cabinet itself has delegated legislative power.

In continental European jurisprudence and legal discussion, &quot;the legislator&quot; (&quot;&quot;) is the abstract entity that has produced the laws. When there is room for interpretation, the intent of the legislator will be questioned, and the court is directed to rule in the direction it judges to best fit the legislative intent, which can be difficult in the case of conflicting laws or constitutional provisions.

== Terminology ==
The local term for a legislator is usually a derivation of the local term for the relevant legislature. Typical examples include
* Parliament: member of parliament
* Assembly: member of the assembly
* Legislature: member of the legislature
* Congress: member of congress
* Senate: senator
* House of Representatives: representative
*The generic term &quot;deputy&quot; may also be used, deriving from the concept that the legislator is &quot;deputising&quot; for the electorate of their electoral district.

=== By country ===
This is an incomplete list of terms for a national legislator:

== Substitute legislator ==
Some legislatures provide each legislator with an official &quot;substitute legislator&quot; who deputises for the legislator in the legislature if the elected representative is unavailable. Venezuela, for example, provides for substitute legislators (&quot;&quot;) to be elected under Article 186 of its 1999 constitution. Ecuador, Panama, and the U.S. state of Idaho also have substitute legislators.

<text>Heping District () is a district in the center of Tianjin, China. It is named after the He Ping Road, the most prosperous street of the district at the time of renaming in 1956.

The district has a long history. Its total area is . There are six subdistricts divided into 88 residential committees (). As of 2020, the district has a total population of 449,100. 

Heping District has historically been the center of culture, commerce, and finance in Tianjin. The Tianjin CBD, shopping centres, and banks are concentrated in this District.

From 2006 to 2008, the leader of the district is Li Runlan ().

Yaohua High School is located in the district. All Nippon Airways has its Tianjin Office in Tower 2 of The Exchange in the district.

== History ==
During the Song dynasty, the lands of today&#x27;s Heping District was under Qingchi count of Cangzhou. Following the Jingkang incident, Qingchi county, along with most of Song territories north of Yellow River was occupied by Jin dynasty. Jin renamed the county as Jinghai in 1193.

In 1730, Jinghai county was combined into Tianjin. Due to its long distance from the originally city center, the district was sparsely populated and underdeveloped. Since 1860, many part of the district was given to Britain, United States, France and Japan as concessions. With the return of the concessions following the end of World War II, former Japanese and French concessions were grouped into the First District, and the former British concessions was changed into the Tenth District. After the founding of People&#x27;s Republic of China, the District was divided into the First and Fifth Districts on October 10, 1952. On the first day of 1956, the First and Fifth Districts were renamed to Heping () District and Xinhua () District respectively, and the Xinhua District was later combined into Heping District on September 9, 1958.

== Administrative divisions ==
There are six subdistricts in the district:

=== Metro ===
Heping District is currently served by two metro lines operated by Tianjin Metro:

* - Xiaobailou, Yingkoudao , Anshandao

<text>The Green Party of Minnesota is a green political party in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is affiliated with the Green Party of the United States.

==History==
The Minnesota Greens Confederation, founded 1990–1991, fostered the development of local Green Party organizations in the state. The Green Party of Minnesota was organized in December 1993. It was officially established in February and June 1994 at two founding conventions.

Twin Cities Greens was organized in 1988. The Green Party of St. Paul was established in 1997 to 1998.

The Green Party of Minnesota was founded in 1994 on the Four Pillars of the Green Party: Ecological Wisdom, Social and Economic Justice, Grassroots Democracy, and Nonviolence and Peace.

In the 2000 presidential election, Green Party presidential nominee Ralph Nader and vice presidential nominee Winona LaDuke received 5% of the vote in Minnesota, which earned major party status for the Green Party in Minnesota. But in the election of 2004, neither Green Party presidential nominee David Cobb nor any candidate for statewide office received 5% or more, thus losing major party status in the state.

In 2003 Elaine Fleming became the first elected Green mayor in Minnesota. Fleming is mayor of Cass Lake, Minnesota, and was elected mayor for her first term by seven votes. Fleming was elected mayor for a second term as a write-in candidate. As of 2006, Fleming was serving her second and last term as Mayor.

While the party is currently defined as a minor political party, it has had recent success in some city elections, especially in Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2005, Cam Gordon, a former chair of the Green Party of Minnesota, was elected in Ward 2 to the Minneapolis City Council, winning over DFLer Cara Letofsky in a 51% to 48% vote. Ward 2 is considered one of the most diverse areas of Minneapolis, representing the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Campus and the Cedar-Riverside and Seward neighborhoods. Despite this gain on the council, two Green incumbents on the council, Natalie Johnson Lee (Ward 6) and Dean Zimmermann (Ward 7), were unseated during the 2005 election. Redistricting had pitted both against other council incumbents.

While initially elected as a Democrat in 1986 to the Minneapolis Park Board, Annie Young ran as a Green from her third term on, becoming one of the longest serving Park Board Commissioners in Minneapolis history.

In 2009, Cam Gordon was re-elected to Minneapolis City Council. In 2011, Green Party endorsed Laura Libby was elected to the Section 1 seat of the City Council of Crystal, Minnesota. Cam Gordon was elected to a third term on the Minneapolis City Council in 2013.

In 2014, the Green Party of Minnesota ran former DFL State Representative Andy Dawkins for Attorney General receiving 1.49% of the vote statewide and regaining minor party status.

Despite restrictive Minnesota ballot access laws, volunteers collected three times the required signatures to place Green endorsed presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein on the ballot in 2016. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon refused to replace the ballot petitions stand-in vice presidential candidate Howie Hawkins with Ajamu Baraka, the only candidate of color in the race, despite no law denying his ability to do so. Dr. Jill Stein went on to receive 1.26% of the vote statewide – double the Green presidential vote from 2012 – and again securing minor party status for the Green Party of Minnesota until 2020.

Three additional Greens were elected in 2016, including the first elected Green in Ramsey County history – Lena Buggs winning a seat on the Ramsey County Soil &amp; Water District Board unseating the incumbent. In Anoka County, Greens Sharon Lemay and Steve Laitinen were both elected to the Anoka County Soil and Water District Board as well.

== Ideology ==
The Green Party of Minnesota follows the ideals of green politics, which are based on the Four Pillars of the Green Party: Ecological wisdom, Social justice, Grassroots democracy and Nonviolence. The &quot;Ten Key Values,&quot; which expand upon the four pillars, are as follows:
# Grassroots democracy
# Social justice
# Ecological wisdom
# Nonviolence
# Decentralization
# Community-based economics
# Women&#x27;s rights
# Respect for diversity
# Global responsibility
# Future focus

The Green Party of Minnesota constitution Article XI Section 2 prohibits donations from corporations or political action committees (PACs). The party&#x27;s platforms and rhetoric harshly criticize any corporate influence and control over government, media, and society at large.

==Leadership==
The party is led by a 17-member coordinating committee which sets the party&#x27;s long-range goals, budget, and strategy. These decisions are then implemented by an executive committee made of five party co-chairs, each of whom is responsible for one of five portfolios of party business (membership, political affairs, finances, communications, and internal organization). Each portfolio co-chair oversees a number of committees and party functions. While the coordinating and executive committees handle day-to-day operations of the state party, most organizing, activism, and decision-making is decentralized into a number of autonomous local party organizations (or &quot;seedlings&quot;) located throughout the state.

<text>The Guadalupe River (; Muwekma Ohlone:&quot;Thámien Rúmmey&quot;) mainstem is an urban, northward flowing river in California whose much longer headwater creeks originate in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The river mainstem now begins on the Santa Clara Valley floor when Los Alamitos Creek exits Lake Almaden and joins Guadalupe Creek just downstream of Coleman Road in San Jose, California. From here it flows north through San Jose, where it receives Los Gatos Creek, a major tributary. The Guadalupe River serves as the eastern boundary of the City of Santa Clara and the western boundary of Alviso, and after coursing through San José, it empties into south San Francisco Bay at the Alviso Slough.

Much of the river is surrounded by parks. The river&#x27;s Los Alamitos and Guadalupe Creek tributaries are, in turn, fed by smaller streams flowing from Almaden Quicksilver County Park, home to former mercury mines dating back to when the area was governed by Mexico. The Guadalupe watershed carries precipitation from the slopes of Loma Prieta and Mount Umunhum, the two major peaks of the Sierra Azul, the historical Spanish name (&quot;Blue Mountains&quot;) for that half of the Santa Cruz Mountains south of California Highway 17. Two of the Guadalupe River&#x27;s major tributaries, Los Gatos Creek and Guadalupe Creek have their sources in the Sierra Azul Open Space Preserve on the western and eastern flanks of the Sierra Azul.

== History ==
The Guadalupe River was named by the Juan Bautista de Anza Expedition on March 30, 1776, &quot;Río de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe&quot;, in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the principal patron saint of the expedition. Specifically, Juan Bautista de Anza camped along the banks of the Guadalupe River at Expedition Camp 97 on March 30, 1776 near the present-day site of Agnews State Hospital (Santa Clara County, 2001). The historic de Anza Expedition explored much of Santa Clara County, traversing western areas en route from Monterey to San Francisco, and traveling around the south end of San Francisco Bay and thence through the eastern portions of the county on the return trip after exploration of parts of the East Bay.

In 1777, the original Mission Santa Clara de Thamien and el Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe were established on the banks of Mission Creek, &quot;un tiro de escopeta&quot; (a musket shot away) from its confluence with the Guadalupe River. Both had to be moved away from the river because of mosquitoes in the summertime and flooding during the winter. Today Santa Clara Mission is away from the original location.

Historically the Guadalupe River was even shorter, originating several miles further north, at the downstream end of a large willow swamp that is now Willow Glen. Its main tributary was known as &quot;Arroyo Seco de Guadalupe&quot; on 1860 maps and then as &quot;Arroyo Seco de Los Capitancillos&quot; on the 1876 Thompson &amp; West maps.

On July 9, 2005, the fossilized bones of a juvenile Columbian mammoth were discovered by San Jose resident Roger Castillo in the Lower Guadalupe River near the Trimble Road overcrossing. Roger founded the Salmon and Steelhead Restoration Group conservation organization and has served as a board member of the Guadalupe–Coyote Resource Conservation District. The Pleistocene mammoth was nicknamed &quot;Lupe&quot; by area residents and Lupe&#x27;s fossils are exhibited at Children&#x27;s Discovery Museum of San Jose.

== Guadalupe watershed ==
Historically, the Guadalupe River flowed into Guadalupe Slough, west of its current drainage into Alviso Slough. To make it easier to get sailboats up the Guadalupe River to the port of Alviso, the river was redirected into the straighter Alviso Slough by the 1870s. Alviso Slough, also known as &quot;Steamboat Slough&quot; historically, was relatively straight, while Guadalupe Slough meandered extensively through the marshes. Alviso Slough was historically not fed by any upland streams, but simply carried tidewater in and out of the extensive salt marshes.

The re-routing of the river to Alviso Slough in the 1870s also disconnected it from several tributaries, and had the effect of shrinking the Guadalupe watershed. San Tomas Aquino Creek (current) and its Saratoga Creek tributary (previously known as &quot;San Jon Creek&quot; and &quot;Campbell Creek&quot;) and Calabazas Creek (historic), used to enter the Guadalupe River upstream of Alviso. These tributaries were disconnected from the river and re-routed directly into Guadalupe Slough between 1876 and 1890 according to historic maps. Reportedly, Saratoga Creek (Campbell Creek) had steelhead and coho salmon runs. Large portions of the tributaries of the river were straightened and armored starting in the late 19th century and continuing through the 20th century first by farmers and then by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) and its predecessor organizations. They now go dry in the summer months and their lower segments have become denuded ditches requiring continuous maintenance. Mission Creek used to harbor trout and salmon but today it is buried in a culvert. The historic watershed can be viewed in the Thompson and West 1876 maps.

The Guadalupe River watershed today drains an area of . Below its origination at the confluence of Guadalupe Creek and Los Alamitos Creek, the mainstem is joined by three other tributaries: Ross, Canoas, and Los Gatos Creeks. The SCVWD manages water flows (supply) and provides flood control on the river, and recently has started to promote watershed stewardship. Six major reservoirs exist in the watershed: Calero Reservoir on Calero Creek, Guadalupe Reservoir on Guadalupe Creek, Almaden Reservoir on Alamitos Creek, Vasona Reservoir, Lexington Reservoir, and Lake Elsman on Los Gatos Creek.

=== Restoration of the river mouth ===

Ending nine years of study and passionate debate about the future of the San Jose/Alviso waterfront, the Santa Clara Valley Water District in November, 2009 voted to approve a $6 million project to clear bulrushes, tule reeds and thick sediment from the Guadalupe River in Alviso. The construction of salt evaporation ponds in the 1930s rerouted the river, cutting off tidal action. Later, in the 1960s, as Alviso was being annexed into San Jose, the Army Corps of Engineers and the water district straightened the river to improve flood safety, which inadvertently increased sedimentation into Alviso Slough. The current project will open a former Cargill salt pond (known as A8) as the beginning of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project, considered the largest tidal wetland restoration project on the West Coast. When complete, the project should restore of industrial salt ponds to tidal wetlands. Pond A8 will be the first one worked on.

== Habitat and wildlife ==

A recent ancient DNA sequencing study of salmonid remains excavated from Mission Santa Clara dating to 1781–1834 CE found that of 58 salmonid vertebrae analyzed, three samples had DNA sequences indicating Chinook salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha&quot;), the other 55 were steelhead trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). The same study also found 53 marine specimens at Mission Santa Clara. Chinook salmon were historically abundant in the Sacramento River and would pass through San Francisco Bay to marine habitats, but rarely entered streams south of San Francisco Bay, and were not documented in the Guadalupe River watershed or other Santa Clara County streams prior to the 1980s. Both steelhead trout, which were recorded in select Santa Clara County streams historically, and Chinook salmon runs occur in the Guadalupe River watershed today when conditions are appropriate. Two genetic analyses found that Chinook salmon in the Guadalupe River are closely related to fall-run Central Valley stock with a genetic affinity to the Feather River hatchery and genetically differentiated from coastal Chinook. Chinook salmon are adept at colonizing neighboring and even distant streams and rivers, as evidenced by the recent finding of juvenile Chinook salmon from the Klamath River in the Napa River, and hatchery fish are known to stray at higher rates than naturally spawned fish. In 2012, the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Plan reported that Chinook salmon currently spawn in the Guadalupe River and its tributaries, as well as Coyote Creek. Because Chinook spawn in early winter and juveniles may migrate to the ocean in their first spring, Chinook are able to use habitats that turn very warm or have low water quality in summer.

On the Los Gatos Creek tributary a population of California Golden beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis subauratus&quot;) has been re-established between Lake Elsman and Lexington Reservoir. The beaver were re-introduced to the portion of Los Gatos Creek where it enters Lexington Reservoir sometime prior to 1997, and recently, a beaver reportedly served as &quot;a hearty meal&quot; for a local mountain lion. Video documentary by Greg Kerekes documented beaver in the Guadalupe River mainstem in downtown San Jose in April, 2013. These are the first beaver recorded in the Santa Clara Valley since zoologist James Graham Cooper captured one in Santa Clara for the Smithsonian Institution on Dec. 31, 1855. Historical evidence of beaver in the area includes reference by Captain John Sutter who around 1840 recorded that 1,500 beaver pelts were sold &quot;at a trifling value&quot; by the Indians to Mission San José. In 1840, from the port of Alviso, California, beaver pelts, cattle hides and tallow were shipped to San Francisco. In addition, in 1828 fur trapper Michel La Framboise travelled from the Bonaventura River to San Francisco and then the missions of San José, San Francisco Solano and San Rafael Arcángel. La Framboise stated that &quot;the Bay of San Francisco abounds in beaver&quot;, and that he &quot;made his best hunt in the vicinity of the missions&quot;. Golden beaver were apparently wiped out by trappers in the Bay Area sometime after the end of the California Fur Rush.

Caspian terns (&quot;Hydroprogne caspia&quot;), North America&#x27;s largest tern, return to the Bay every spring to nest, migrating from as far away as Colombia. According to scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, Caspian tern populations in the South Bay are declining at the same time that high levels of mercury are being found in their eggs. The highest mercury levels found in animals from the Bay were in the eggs of Caspian and Forster&#x27;s (&quot;Sterna forsteri&quot;) terns that nest near the Cargill salt ponds at the mouth of the Guadalupe River. A study conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has found that nearly three-quarters of the eggs examined from black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) nests in the Guadalupe watershed contained mercury exceeding thresholds known to kill the embryos of other bird species.

=== Flooding ===
The river occasionally floods in downtown San Jose, south of downtown, as well as in Alviso. Flooding prompted President Clinton to declare a National Disaster Area in 1995 and 1997. In March 1995, flooding of this river around the San Jose Arena caused the cancellation of a San Jose Sharks game, the only rainout in the history of the National Hockey League. This flood, like most Guadalupe River floods, was triggered by undersized bridges, in this case the Julian Street Bridge.

The river has flooded 15 times since World War II. In response to this flooding, the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD) launched a series of flood protection projects along the Guadalupe River to ensure that residential and commercial areas near the river are protected from 100-year floods. A major component of the flood control project, designed to control a 100-year flood along the Lower Guadalupe, was completed in late 2008. The greatest Guadalupe River flood on record occurred in 1955 and was part of the legendary &quot;Christmas Week Floods&quot; when the Guadalupe River flooded .

=== Drought ===
After four years of the harsh California drought, in July 2015, the river ran dry for an 8-mile stretch through the city of San Jose. This was due to inadequate storage in upstream reservoirs for the releases of water needed to sustain flow to the river mouth until winter rains returned.

=== Mercury contamination ===
The Guadalupe watershed was an area of intense activity during the California Gold Rush, with the quicksilver mines within Santa Clara County supporting the gold refinement process. Thus, mercury toxicity and its effects on surrounding humans and wildlife is a major concern for the area. Because mercury is an effective magnet for gold, miners during the Gold Rush would regularly line their sluices with Mercury to amalgamate the gold. An estimated 6,500 tons of mercury was lost in the system of creeks and rivers along the coast between 1850 and 1920, and is currently being detected today in the local streams, animal life, and riverbeds of these affected tributaries. Mercury loads are mobilized during large storm events. An evaluation of mercury loads during the large January 2017 rainstorms was similar to data gathered during a similar storm in 2002. Animals at the top of the food chain that consume fish contaminated with mercury are the most vulnerable, including predatory fish, birds, mammals, and humans that consume fish due to a process called biomagnification.

<text>Carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate) is a chemical in the carbamate family used chiefly as an insecticide. It is a white crystalline solid previously sold under the brand name Sevin, which was a trademark of the Bayer Company. Union Carbide discovered carbaryl and introduced it commercially in 1958. Bayer purchased Aventis CropScience in 2002, a company that included Union Carbide pesticide operations. Carbaryl was the third-most-used insecticide in the United States for home gardens, commercial agriculture, and forestry and rangeland protection. As a veterinary drug, it is known as carbaril (INN).

==Production==
Carbaryl is often inexpensively produced by direct reaction of methyl isocyanate with 1-naphthol.
:C10H7OH + CH3NCO → C10H7OC(O)NHCH3

Alternatively, 1-naphthol can be treated with excess phosgene to produce 1-naphthylchloroformate, which is then converted to carbaryl by reaction with methylamine. The former process was carried out in Bhopal. In comparison, the latter synthesis uses exactly the same reagents, but in a different sequence. This procedure avoids the potential hazards of methyl isocyanate.

==Biochemistry==
Carbamate insecticides are slowly irreversible inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. They resemble acetylcholine, but the carbamoylated enzyme undergoes the final hydrolysis step very slowly (minutes) compared with the acetylated enzyme generated by acetylcholine (microseconds). They interfere with the cholinergic nervous system and cause death because the effects of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine cannot be terminated by carbamoylated acetylcholinesterase.

==Applications==
The development of the carbamate insecticides has been called a major breakthrough in pesticides. The carbamates do not have the persistence of chlorinated pesticides. Although toxic to insects, carbaryl is detoxified and eliminated rapidly in vertebrates. It is neither concentrated in fat nor secreted in milk, so is favored for food crops, at least in the US. It is the active ingredient in Carylderm shampoo used to combat head lice until infestation is eliminated.

==Ecology==
Carbaryl kills both targeted (e.g., malaria-carrying mosquitos) and beneficial insects (e.g., honeybees), as well as crustaceans. Because it is highly toxic to zooplankton, the algae they feed on experience blooms. Boone &amp; Bridges 2003 find that larger algae eaters such as &quot;Bufo woodhousii&quot; benefit from this effect.

Although it can increase survival rates for organisms that benefit from consequential algae blooms, the long term effects of these changes in competition levels and predation can be detrimental to many aquatic ecosystems, particularly those dominated by Anurans.

It is approved for more than 100 crops in the US. Carbaryl has been illegal in the EU since 21 November 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Commission Decision 2007/355/EC&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Angola.

==Safety==
Carbaryl is a cholinesterase inhibitor and is toxic to humans. It is classified as a likely human carcinogen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.) The oral is 250 to 850 mg/kg for rats and 100 to 650 mg/kg for mice.

Carbaryl can be produced using methyl isocyanate (MIC) as an intermediary. A leak of MIC used in the production of carbaryl caused the Bhopal disaster, the most lethal industrial accident in history.

<text>Hemoglobinuria is a condition in which the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is found in abnormally high concentrations in the urine. The condition is caused by excessive intravascular hemolysis, in which large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed, thereby releasing free hemoglobin into the plasma. Excess hemoglobin is filtered by the kidneys, which excrete it into the urine, giving urine a purple color. Hemoglobinuria can lead to acute tubular necrosis which is an uncommon cause of a death of uni-traumatic patients recovering in the ICU.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is often made based on the medical history, blood samples, and a urine sample. The absence of urine RBCs and RBC casts microscopically despite a positive dipstick test suggests hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria. The medical term for RBCs in the urine is hematuria.

<text>Michael J. Watts (born 1951 in England) is Professor Emeritus of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley. He retired in 2016. He is a leading critical intellectual figure of the academic left. 

His first book, &quot;Silent Violence:Food, Famine and Peasantry in Northern Nigeria&quot; (1983, 2013), is considered a pioneering work in political ecology. Other published works include &quot;Reworking Modernity: Capitalisms and Symbolic Discontent&quot; (1992, with Allan Pred), &quot;Liberation Ecologies&quot; (1996, 2004, with Richard Peet), &quot;The Hettner Lectures: Geographies of Violence&quot; (2000), &quot;Violent Environments&quot; (2001, with Nancy Lee Peluso) and the &quot;Curse of the Black Gold&quot; (2008, with photojournalist Ed Kashi). Watts has also been an assistant editor of the award-winning &quot;New Encyclopedia of Africa&quot; (2008) and its predecessor, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Africa South of the Sahara&quot; (1997).

==Biography==
After spending his childhood in a village between Bath and Bristol, Watts attended University College London, from which he received his distinction bachelor&#x27;s degree in geography in 1972.

Watts received his PhD in geography in 1979 from the University of Michigan. His PhD work was on agrarian change and politics in Northern Nigeria, based on over two years of fieldwork and archival research and supervised by Bernard Q. Neitschmann, before the Michigan Geography Department was disestablished. It was published in revised form as &quot;Silent Violence: Food, Famine and Peasantry in Northern Nigeria&quot; in 1983. &quot;Silent Violence&quot; is considered a pioneering work in the field of political ecology.

Watts joined the faculty of the Geography Department at UC Berkeley in 1979 and remained there his whole career. He served from 1994 to 2004 as Director of the Institute of International Studies, a program that promotes cross-disciplinary global and transnational research and training. He has supervised over 75 PhD students and post-docs, including those contributing to a &quot;Festschrift&quot; volume in 2017 edited by Chari, Friedberg, Gidwani, Ribot and Wolford.

Watts is married to Mary Beth Pudup, who is a UC Santa Cruz faculty member, and has two children. He is a member of the Retort collective, a Bay Area-based collective of radical intellectuals, with whom he authored the book &quot;Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War&quot;, published by Verso Books.

Watts is also on the advisory board of FFIPP-USA (Faculty for Israeli-Palestinian Peace-USA), a network of Palestinian, Israeli, and International faculty, and students, working for an end of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and just peace. In 2021, with other faculty at the University of California, he joined a letter calling Palestinian activism &quot;a global movement for liberation from settler colonialism and racial apartheid.&quot;

On 25 July 2007, Watts was shot in the hand in Port Harcourt, Nigeria by unknown gunmen who attacked the office of the &quot;National Point&quot; newspaper, apparently in an attempted robbery.

==Scholarship==
Watts works on a variety of themes from African development to contemporary geopolitics, social movements and oil politics. As Tom Perrault notes, his work charted a &quot;rigorous and wide-ranging theoretical engagement with Marxian political economy&quot;, with contributions to the development of political ecology, struggles over resources, and – more recently – how the politics of identity play out in the contemporary world. His first major study, &quot;Silent Violence&quot;, dealt with the effects of colonialism on the susceptibility of Northern Nigerians to food shortage and famine. Over the last decade he has continued to work in Nigeria, but on the political ecology of oil and the effect of oil exploitation on Ogoni people in the Niger delta.
He has also explored issues of global agriculture and food availability, gender and households, irrigation politics, and Islam.

Watts&#x27;s work has been much debated in the social sciences, in terms of its attachment to Marxist and post-Marxist theory, and in terms of the appropriate role for academic thinking in contemporary struggles against inequality and poverty alleviation.

<doc id="661641" wikidata="Q1783605" url="?curid=661641" title="Staffing">
<text>Staffing is the process of finding the right worker with appropriate qualifications or experience and recruiting them to fill a job position or role. Through this process, organizations acquire, deploy, and retain a workforce of sufficient quantity and quality to create positive impacts on the organization&#x27;s effectiveness. In management, staffing is an operation of recruiting the employees by evaluating their skills and knowledge before offering them specific job roles accordingly.

A staffing model is a data set that measures work activities, how many labor hours are needed, and how employee time is spent.

== Importance ==
Staffing helps to find and hire people who are qualified for the job position and will benefit the company. It also improves the quality and quantity of work done by the company because they have staffed the optimum people. Job satisfaction rates are likely to increase because everyone is well-suited for their position and is happy to be doing their specialty of work. Higher rates of productive performance from the company are also common, as they have staffed the right people to do their jobs. It provides employees the opportunity for further growth and development.

== Quantity and quality ==
Staffing an organization focuses on both the quality and the quantity of the staff.

The quantity is the number of staff. The organization forecasts workforce quantity requirements and then compares it to the available workforce. If the headcount matches the requirement, then the organization is fully staffed. If the requirement exceeds the number of available employees, then the organization is understaffed. If the available staff exceeds the requirements, then the organization is overstaffed and may need to stop hiring and layoff employees. When a company is understaffed, the staffing process may restart.

The quality is having the right person for the job. The right person should have a job and an organization match. The job match involves the employee&#x27;s knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics and how they work with the job&#x27;s tasks. The organization match is when the person has the same organizational values as the organization.

== Core staffing activities ==
Human resource management (HRM) encompasses a spectrum of functions and activities aimed at managing an organization&#x27;s workforce effectively. Core staffing activities are integral components of HRM, focusing on the acquisition and management of human resources within an organization. These activities are fundamental in building and maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce. The five core staffing activities are recruitment, selection, employment, training and retention.

=== Recruitment: The Foundation of Workforce Building ===
Recruitment serves as the foundation of an effective staffing system. Unlike the private sector, where profit motives often drive hiring decisions, the public sector focuses on providing essential public services. A well-executed recruitment process is instrumental in identifying, attracting. and engaging potential candidates who possess the requisite qualifications and characteristics to excel in specific job roles. Key components of recruitment include:

Goals and Job Descriptions

Prior to initiating the recruitment process, organizations must define clear goals and job descriptions. This entails evaluating positions and job categories by conducting a thorough examination known as job analysis, which is a comprehensive procedure for documenting and defining job roles and tasks. Job analysis is widely regarded as a fundamental component of successful HRM, and it holds particular significance in staffing processes such as recruitment and selection, where it helps gauge the extent of job performance. It centers on delineating the job&#x27;s duties, obligations, necessary expertise, skills, and other essential attributes needed to execute the role.

Internal vs. External Recruitment

Organizations face a critical decision regarding whether to recruit internally or externally. Internal recruitment involves filling a vacancy from within the existing workforce, promoting loyalty and potentially reducing costs. However, it may limit innovation and leave gaps in the workforce. External recruitment, on the other hand, seeks candidates outside the organization, increasing the chances of recruiting experienced and qualified individuals. Yet, external recruits may lack a deep understanding of the company culture, and internal disputes may arise.

Depending on the chosen recruitment approach, organizations can employ various communication strategies. In an open recruitment system, all employees are notified about job openings and are given the opportunity to apply. In a closed recruitment system, only specific employees are informed about the vacancy. A hybrid recruitment system combines elements of both open and closed recruitment.

Sourcing Candidates

Effective recruitment hinges on diverse sourcing strategies. Job boards like LinkedIn and Indeed serve as central hubs, reaching a wide audience. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter provide direct access to candidates. Furthermore, organizational career pages offer convenience. It is important to collaborate with external agencies broadens the talent pool.

=== Selection: Identifying the Right Fit ===
Selection holds significant importance within the staffing procedure, as mishandling it may result in the organization missing out on potential candidates. The primary aim of the selection process is to assess whether a candidate is a suitable fit for employment within the organization or not.

Candidate Evaluation: This process starts with the review of the job applications, résumés, and cover letters of the job candidates. During the reviewing of candidates, initial screening is an important aspect too. As part of evaluating a candidate, testing include personality, ability, and intelligence tests can be undertaken.

Interviews: Interviews are vital for HR professionals to assess candidates. Behavioral interviews focus on past experiences to predict future performance. Technical interviews evaluate candidates&#x27; skills. Panel interviews involve multiple interviewers, providing diverse perspectives. These methods help in comprehensive candidate evaluation.

Contingent assessment: Depending on the organization, this is the last step. It includes drug tests and medical exams. The final step may encompass drug tests and medical exams to ensure candidates meet specific health and safety requirements.

=== Standards for Recruitment and Selection ===
When staffing, mainly for the public sector, recruitment and selection processes are distinctive due to the heightened importance of transparency, accountability, and alignment with public values. These processes are often subject to intense public scrutiny, necessitating a commitment to transparency in all stages of sourcing, evaluation, and selection. to ensure that candidates are assessed solely on their qualifications and competencies, thereby mitigating personal connections or favoritism. Below are some of them:

Merit Based Selection: This is an important standard to ensure that candidates are evaluated based on qualifications and competencies rather than personal connections or favoritism.

Alignment with Organizational Values: Candidates in the public sector are typically assessed for their alignment with public service principles, commitment to transparency, and ability to make decisions in the public interest.

Diversity and Inclusion: Public sector recruitment efforts place a strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion to ensure that the government workforce reflects the diverse populations it serves.

=== Employment ===
Employment is the process of hiring the individual who was selected in the selection process. The organization should first propose a job offer, which typically includes starting date, duration of the contract, compensation, starting rate, benefits, and hours of the position. The organization then prepares for the new employee&#x27;s arrival. Ideally, the company should make sure that the employee has all of the tools required to do their job effectively, such as security badges, keys, and any other technology.

=== Training ===
After the selection of an employee, the employee receives training. With the various technological changes in modern history, the need for training employees is increased to keep the employees in touch with the various new developments. Staffing can be influenced by how staffers are trained and the type of training they receive.

Training is generally classified into two types, on the job and off the job. Some examples of training programs include:

* Technical training – training that teaches employees about a particular technology or a machine.
* Quality training – trains employees to identify faulty products.
* Skills training – training that is given to employees to perform their particular jobs.
* Soft skills – personality development
* Team training – training establishes a level of trust and synchronicity between team members for increased efficiency.

====Training associated with High-Performance Work System (HPWS) perspective====

A scenario in the U.S Federal Workforce suggested that High-Performance Work System (HPWS) perspective is a theoretical 
framework that discovers the connections between human resource practices and organisational outcomes. Significantly, HPWS focuses on the belief that effective HR practices within an organisation implementation will fabricate a workforce that compromised both effective and efficient employees with the qualities of trained, motivated, and dedicated. HPWSs are composed of interrelated HR practices (HPWPs) that are used to cultivate employees&#x27; talents and skills and ultimately apply their abilities to their work, which encourage positive organisational outcomes such as motivation, dedication, and retention. 
Training and development opportunities are one such HPWP that is explored further. The efficacy of a HPWS increases when multiple HPWPs are administered simultaneously in bundles. Some HPWPs include efficient recruitment and selection, enhanced training and development, and competitive compensation and incentives.

====Training vs job demand and resources====

The Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) model is a theoretical framework that explains how job demands and job resources can impact employee well-being and work engagement. In this model, training and development is considered a job resource that can buffer the impact of job demands and increase rates of work engagement. Even though training and development is contemplated a job resource in the JD-R model, relatively few studies examine whether having access to training and developmental opportunities buffer the impact of job demands and rocket rates of work engagement, especially on a sample from the federal workforce. Studies have connected training to work outcomes and have seen its positive effects on employees. These outcomes include four increased rates of (i)positive efficacy, (ii)job satisfaction, (iii)job performance, and (iv)organisational performance. Moreover, access training, as a job resource, positively correlates with work engagement and negatively correlates with burnout and turnover.

====Training implementation beliefs====

Self-efficacy- refers to an individual belief in their ability to perform a specific task or achieve a specific goal. It is the passion and mentality that an individual has and to head on all the challenges faced while striving to accomplish target goals. Individuals with high self-efficacy are more motivated and committed to transferring the learned skills to their workplace. In short, self-efficacy is having the &#x27;I can do it&#x27; belief.

Instrumentality/utility- refers to an individual&#x27;s perception of the usefulness of training activities. Perception could be based on how employees interpret different sensations. When trainees attach value to training activities, they are more likely to be motivated to learn and apply the learned skills in their jobs. In short, instrumentality is having the &#x27;I will do it&#x27; belief.

For instance, if an individual has the passion and competence to do the job, he/she will enjoy it, and it will be more meaningful in having lots of ideas for improvement and innovation implemented into the workplace, which will be a very different scenario from those who are not interested, who will just be keep watching the time to go home, more like looking busy doing nothing.

Therefore, both beliefs are significant predictors of training implementation behaviours as individuals with high self-efficacy and high instrumentality beliefs are more likely to implement the training they received on their jobs and transforming the skills to reality in workplaces.

====Factors affecting training implementation behaviours====

Perceived flexibility - refers to the extent to which employees perceive their work environment as flexible, moderates the relationship between self-efficacy beliefs and training implementation behaviours.

Performance feedback - refers to the extent to which employees receive feedback on their performance, and moderates the relationship between instrumentality beliefs and training implementation behaviours.

Supervisor support – refers to the direct effect on training implementation behaviours.

====Five practical implications to improve training programs in public sector organisations====

#Design training programs that enhance trainees&#x27; self-efficacy beliefs and instrumentality beliefs to improve training transfer.

#Provide a flexible work environment that allows employees to apply the skills learned in their jobs.

#Provide performance feedback to employees to reinforce the usefulness of the training activities.

#Provides supervisor support to employees to encourage them to implement the learned skills in their jobs.

#Evaluate the effectiveness of their training programs by measuring the extent to which the learned skills transfer to the job and lead to meaningful changes in work performance.

=== Retaining ===
Employees can leave jobs for a variety of different reasons. Employers should listen to the needs of their employees and make them feel valued. Employers need to create a positive work culture and motivating practices into their organization to keep employees.

Retention methods have a positive impact on the organization&#x27;s turnover rate. Benefits can include training, positive culture, growth opportunities within the organization, trust and confidence in leaders, and lower stress from overworking.

== Staffing agencies ==
Staffing agencies are becoming more common because of their ease of use and low cost. Companies save a lot of money through using a staffing agency because they do not have to spend extra money on employee recruitment or fund any of the screenings new hires must undergo. Using a staffing agency eliminates the need for companies to do extensive advertisements about the positions they are hiring for. The agencies save time by avoiding having to spend a large amount of time searching for applicants and recruiting new people. Staffing agencies provide a large network of job candidates, so it is easy to find people to fill the jobs. They have many tools and the knowledge to find the perfect applicants for the jobs each company needs to fill. If a company has an unexpected need to fill a position, a staffing agency can usually quickly find someone.

== Staffing Technologies ==
Staffing technology is a broad term that encompasses the systems, processes, and software used by modern-day recruiting teams. It includes databases, applicant tracking systems (ATS), and complex web-based job boards. Staffing technology has come a long way from fax machines and telephones. In the last decade, modern-day technology, including live and asynchronous online video interviewing, artificial intelligence, chatbots, and social media, has influenced the staffing field. It has evolved significantly over the past decade, and today, it is no longer a matter of either/or when it comes to sourcing strategies. Staffing technologies can be used in unison to generate even better results in many cases. For instance, sourcing algorithms can identify candidates who are likely to fit a job well. Technology is being utilized to speed up the hiring process, reduce hiring costs, enhance the candidate experience during the hiring processes, facilitate candidate assessment and selection. Staffing technology can also be used to socialize new hires, track employees&#x27; skills and promotion readiness, along with retention enhancement and the creation of better relationships with high-potential future applicants (. Staffing technologies have made the job search process more efficient for companies and transparent for job seekers and employers alike.

Top Trends in Staffing Technologies:

Applicant Tracking System (ATS)

An applicant tracking system enables firms to gather data, classify prospects according to experience and skill level, and screen candidates. ATS is time efficient for organisations as the recruiters spend less time eliminating the less suitable individuals who have applied for certain roles due to the fact that many vacant positions can get hundreds or even more applicants that are unqualified. It screens and sort through CV’s using cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and natural language processing matching an analyzing data using other algorithms.

Benefits of using ATS in Staffing processes

* Improve quality of hire: Only the top applicants in the applicant pool are selected due to the initial automatic matching of candidates that recruiters will interact with.
* Speed up recruitment cycle: Recruiters can plan and carry out a more effective workflow using ATS.
* Reduce administrative tasks: Less paper-based work.
* Provide better and faster CV screening: Some vacancies receive an average of 250 applications, making it burdensome for recruiters to screen every incoming application. With ATS, the process is significantly shortened.

Candidate Recruitment Management (CRM)

CRM for recruiting helps companies find the best candidates for each role and fill positions by automating communications, creating an organized and accessible candidate database. The database includes real-time insights and offers multiple views to showcase data in various ways. The most powerful CRM software includes several beneficial features that simplify the development of candidates&#x27; profiles and talent pools, reduce time-to-hire, and increase recruitment team productivity.

CRM promotes engagement and enhances candidates&#x27; experience by streamlining candidate communication and maintaining and enhancing relationships through automated email marketing, recruiting features, a job suggestion portal, and other means. Some of the features of CRM include:

* Automations: Saving time and eliminating the repetition of work, directing recruiters&#x27; focus on the next stage of staffing.
* Integrations: Storing all tools within CRM, creating custom automation recipes without developers. Manage the entire pipeline without needing to switch tabs.
* Views: Visualize data and the recruitment tools within minutes. For example, use the timeline view to see how long it takes candidates to go through the hiring process.
* Dashboards: View all important information in one place with custom boards, increasing visibility into hiring rate, job openings, salary expectations, and team performance. This feature of CRM helps run reports from a high-level view of your recruitment funnel down to the tiny details.

Benefits of using CRM in Staffing processes

# Assist in finding candidates: By distributing jobs with a single click to numerous free and paid employment platforms, CRM is very effective and efficient for large organizations, such as public organizations.
# Attracting Candidates: By utilizing social media platforms and recruiting through social media forms, CRM improves employer branding and search engine optimization.
# Engage and Nurture candidates: The recruitment platform provides solutions for candidate relationship management, email recruiting campaigns, and talent networking.

Overall benefits of staffing technologies include:

* Faster hiring
* Gain a competitive advantage: Improving the hiring process minimizes the risk of losing top talent to other employers.
* Select the best candidates: Identification of the best and most qualified candidates quickly and accurately.
* Create a better hiring experience: The digital transformation of the staffing process is becoming more flexible, transparent, and practical.

<doc id="661648" wikidata="Q1369730" url="?curid=661648" title="Pluggable Authentication Module">
<text>A pluggable authentication module (PAM) is a mechanism to integrate multiple low-level authentication schemes into a high-level application programming interface (API). PAM allows programs that rely on authentication to be written independently of the underlying authentication scheme. It was first proposed by Sun Microsystems in an Open Software Foundation Request for Comments (RFC) 86.0 dated October 1995. It was adopted as the authentication framework of the Common Desktop Environment. As a stand-alone open-source infrastructure, PAM first appeared in Red Hat Linux 3.0.4 in August 1996 in the Linux PAM project. PAM is currently supported in the AIX operating system, DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Linux, macOS, NetBSD and Solaris.

Since no central standard of PAM behavior exists, there was a later attempt to standardize PAM as part of the X/Open UNIX standardization process, resulting in the X/Open Single Sign-on (XSSO) standard. This standard was not ratified, but the standard draft has served as a reference point for later PAM implementations (for example, OpenPAM).

==Criticisms==
Since most PAM implementations do not interface with remote clients themselves, PAM, on its own, cannot implement Kerberos, the most common type of SSO used in Unix environments. This led to SSO&#x27;s incorporation as the &quot;primary authentication&quot; portion of the would-be XSSO standard and the advent of technologies such as SPNEGO and SASL. This lack of functionality is also the reason SSH does its own authentication mechanism negotiation.

In most PAM implementations, pam_krb5 only fetches Ticket Granting Tickets, which involves prompting the user for credentials, and this is only used for the initial login in an SSO environment. To fetch a service ticket for a particular application, and not prompt the user to enter credentials again, that application must be specifically coded to support Kerberos. This is because pam_krb5 cannot itself get service tickets, although there are versions of PAM-KRB5 that are attempting to work around the issue.

<doc id="661649" wikidata="Q7869009" url="?curid=661649" title="USS Eagle (1812)">
<text>USS &quot;Eagle&quot;, was a ship which served in the United States Navy in 1813-1815. Originally a merchant sloop, she was purchased at Vergennes, Vermont on Lake Champlain in 1812 and fitted as either sloop of war or brig for naval service. The British captured her in 1813 and renamed her HMS &quot;Finch&quot;, only to lose her back to the Americans at the Battle of Lake Champlain in 1814. She was sold in 1815.

==American service and capture==
She cruised on the lake under the command of Sailing Master J. Loomis as a member of Commodore Thomas Macdonough&#x27;s squadron blockading the British advance from Canada. Major George Taylor of the 100th Regiment captured &quot;Eagle&quot; on 3 June 1813 on the Sorrell River near Ile aux Noix on the Canadian side of the lake, after a fight of three-and-a-half hours; British casualties were three men wounded and American casualties were one man killed and eight severely wounded. (Both vessels were taken into Royal Navy service, but the Americans recaptured them the next year.) The British took her into the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Shannon&quot; but later renamed her HMS &quot;Chubb&quot;.

==British service and recapture==

&quot;Finch&quot; accompanied the expedition that burned the arsenal and storehouses at Plattsburgh, New York. She was under the command of Lieutenant William Hicks on 11 September 1814 at the Battle of Lake Champlain. She was bringing up the rear of the British line together with some gunboats. She was ordered to sail towards and engage the USS &quot;Preble&quot;, a sloop of seven guns. As she did so, the schooner USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot; fired on &quot;Finch&quot; shooting away her rigging. &quot;Finch&quot; ran aground near Crab Island where a small American shore battery commenced firing on her. Unable to free herself, and with two men wounded, Hicks struck the colors.

==Fate==
After the Americans recaptured &quot;Finch&quot; they took her back into the U.S. Navy under her original name. After the war, she was sold in July 1815 at Whitehall, New York.

<text>A house church or home church is a label used to describe a group of Christians who regularly gather for worship in private homes. The group may be part of a larger Christian body, such as a parish, but some have been independent groups that see the house church as the primary form of Christian community.

Sometimes these groups meet because the membership is small, and a home is the most appropriate place to assemble until such time as the group has sufficient funds to rent a regular place to meet (as in the beginning phase of the British New Church Movement). Sometimes this meeting style is advantageous because the group is a member of a Christian congregation which is otherwise banned from meeting as is the case in China and Iran.

Some recent Christian writers like Francis Chan have supported the view that the Christian Church should meet in houses, and have based the operation of their communities around multiple small home meetings. Other Christian groups choose to meet in houses when they are in the early phases of church growth because a house is the most affordable option for the small group to meet until the number of people attending the group is sufficient to warrant moving to a commercial location such as a church building. House church organizations claim that this approach is preferable to public meetings in dedicated buildings because it is a more effective way of building community and personal relationships, and it helps the group to engage in outreach more naturally. Some believe small churches were a deliberate apostolic pattern in the first century, and they were intended by Christ.

==Origins==
In the early church, Christian fellowship, prayer, and service took place mainly in private homes, as described in the book of Acts of the Apostles. The Latin term often used is &quot;domus ecclesiae&quot;. 

Several passages in the New Testament specifically mention churches meeting in houses. The first house church is recorded in Acts 1:13, where the disciples of Jesus met together in the &quot;Upper Room&quot; of a house, traditionally believed to be where the Cenacle is today. &quot;The churches of Asia greet you, especially Aquila and Prisca greet you much in the Lord, along with the church that is in their house.&quot; I Corinthians 16:19. The church meeting in the house of Priscilla and Aquila is again mentioned in Romans 16:3, 5. The church that meets in the house of Nymphas is also cited in the Bible: &quot;Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in her house.&quot; Colossians 4:15. There is another reference to the church meeting in Philemon&#x27;s home (&quot;To Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker—also to Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your home:….&quot; Philemon 1:2), but scholars recognize this as simply the meeting place of the Corinthian church—not a separately-meeting house church.

For the first 300 years of Early Christianity, until Constantine legalized Christianity and churches moved into larger buildings, Christians typically met in homes, if only because intermittent persecution (before the Edict of Milan in 313) did not allow the erection of public church buildings. Clement of Alexandria, an early church father, wrote of worshipping in a house. The Dura-Europos church, a private house in Dura-Europos in Syria, was excavated in the 1930s and was found to have been used as a Christian meeting place in AD 232, with one small room serving as a baptistry creating the current style church seen today.

==History==
During the 20th and 21st centuries, the complexity of obtaining government authorizations, in some countries of the world which apply sharia or communism, government authorizations for worship are complex for Evangelical Christians. Because of persecution of Christians, Evangelical house churches are the only option for many Christians to live their faith in community. For example, there is the Evangelical house churches in China movement. The meetings thus take place in private houses, in secret and in &quot;illegality&quot;.

===In China===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), house churches or family churches () are Protestant assemblies that operate independently from the state-sanctioned Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) and China Christian Council (CCC), and came into existence due to the change in religious policy after the end of the Cultural Revolution in the early 1980s. The TSPM was set up after the Communist Party established the PRC in 1949, for Protestants to declare their patriotism and support of the new government. However, by the time of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), all public religious practice came to an end; the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. Many churches, temples and mosques were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, which also criminalized the possession of religious texts. Due to the changes in religious policy after the end of the Cultural Revolution, in 1980, the TSPM was reinstated and the China Christian Council was formed. Protestant congregations that wished to worship publicly registered with the TSPM, but those that did not were eventually termed house churches.

===Revivals===
Recent developments in the house church movement in North America and the United Kingdom are often seen as a return to a New Testament church restorationist paradigm, a restoration of God&#x27;s eternal purpose, and the natural expression of Christ on Earth, urging Christians to reject hierarchy and rank, and return to practices described and encouraged in Scripture. According to some proponents, many churchgoers are turning to house churches because traditional churches fail to meet their relational needs and are not representative of the structure exhibited throughout the Acts of the Apostles and Epistles of the New Testament.

Some authors who are often associated with &quot;house church&quot; by others (examples are Jon Zens, Watchman Nee, T. Austin-Sparks, Milt Rodriguez, Wolfgang Simson, Frank Viola and others) consider the term &quot;house church&quot; to be a misnomer, asserting that the main issue for Christians who gather together is not the location of the meeting, but whether or not Jesus Christ is the functional head of the gathering and face-to-face community is occurring. Other names which may be used to describe these kinds of churches simple church, &quot;relational church,&quot; &quot;primitive church,&quot; &quot;body life,&quot; &quot;organic church&quot; or &quot;biblical church.&quot;. Some authors don&#x27;t believe &quot;house church&quot; or &quot;organic church&quot; are &quot;movements,&quot; and they distinguish between a house church/simple church and an organic expression of the church.

House churches can adopt an organic church philosophy, which is not necessarily a particular method, technique or movement, but rather a particular church expression that the group takes on when the organization is functioning according to the pattern of a living organism. The church represented in the New Testament is based on this principle, and both traditional &amp; contemporary versions of &quot;Westernized&quot; Christianity has reversed this order.

The origins of the modern house church movement in North America and the UK are varied. Some have viewed it as a development and logical extension of the Plymouth Brethren movement, both in doctrine and practice. Many individuals and assemblies have adopted new approaches to worship and governance, while others recognize a relationship to the Anabaptists, the Free Christians, the Quakers, the Amish, the Hutterites, the Mennonites, the Moravians, the Methodists, the much earlier conventicles movement, the Waldenses or the Priscillianists. Another perspective sees the house church movement as a re-emergence of the move of the Holy Spirit during the Jesus Movement of the 1970s in the USA or the worldwide Charismatic Renewal of the late 1960s and 1970s. Others believe that the House Church movement was pioneered by the Reverend Ernest Southcott in the 1950s, when he was Vicar of St Wilfred&#x27;s Church in Halton, Leeds, in England. Southcott believed that if people would not come to church, the church must go to the people, and his book &quot;The Parish Comes Alive&quot; spread this idea widely among Anglicans.

Limited financial resources can encourage church leaders to rethink the pattern of ministry and look for ways to forward the outreach of the church with unpaid members.

==Simple church==
The simple church is an Evangelical Christian movement that reinterprets the nature and practice of church. A simple church may meet anywhere with or without trained leaders, formal liturgy, programs or structures. To facilitate relationship, discipleship (spiritual formation), multiplication, mobility, and member ownership, a simple church is usually a small group of no more than 20-25 persons. Most Church &quot;programs&quot; privately meet during some days of the week and discuss troubles that they are having with their faith, and personal life. Church &quot;programs&quot; are virtually nonexistent and small group participation is essential. The process of moving from worship to small group, small group to mission work, and mission work to worship is a primary focus.

Authors Tony and Felicity Dale, founders of &quot;House2House Ministries&quot;, have promoted the term &quot;simple church&quot; in their book &quot;Simply Church&quot;. The term is often used interchangeably with other terms like organic church, essential church, primitive church, bodylife, relational church, and micro-church.

In the early twenty-first century a number of established Christian denominations and mission organizations have officially supported efforts to develop house church networks.

===Origins and influences===
The simple church movement is part of the broader house church movement. Simple church has also been influenced by overseas missions and the growth of church planting movements. Church planting movements are spontaneously growing church multiplication efforts.

The missional Movement has also influenced simple church.

===Values===
As in any decentralized, spontaneous movement, a variety of values are expressed in simple church. Due to the influence of some key groups and Acts 2:42-47, three overarching values have emerged in many circles. Adherents Paul Kaak (who began ministry in one of the largest and most systematized mega-churches in America) and Neil Cole originally articulated these values using the letters DNA. According to him:
* D – Divine Truth: Truth is the foundation for everything.
*N – Nurturing Relationships : Healthy relationships are what make up a family. Love for one another is to be a constant pursuit of the family of God.
* A – Apostolic Mission : Apostolic means, simply, &quot;sent&quot;.

These values have since been promoted by House2House Ministries and DAWN North America, and have been adopted by various groups such as New York&#x27;s MetroSoul

===Practices===
Adherents of George Barna and Frank Viola&#x27;s book &quot;Pagan Christianity&quot; point out a number of reforms that organic churches often advocate.
* The belief that modern clergy is a vestige of Roman pagan religion that was absent from the early church and is largely at odds with the true priesthood of all believers. The movement sees the institution of the clergy at odds with passages like Matthew 20, Matthew 23, 3rd John, and the message in Revelation regarding the deeds of the Nicolaitans (Greek-literally those who triumph over the people). 1 Corinthians 12-14 paints a picture of an every-member functioning church meeting entirely at odds with the modern religious service which is performed by professionals for an audience. However, some believe this view does not take into account the Jewish and synagogue based nature of the ekklesia, which explains the talk of elders and deacons found in the New Testament. In reply, many simple churches do recognize elders and deacons according to the biblical standards laid out in Timothy and Titus but believe these people emerge over time as their character becomes descriptive of these roles. In an environment where people are free to express their gifts, such people can emerge. Also, being an elder or deacon does not mean this person dominates the meeting. 3 John rebukes Diotrephes the elder who had to be first and was dominating. The simple church largely believes the idea that an elder or deacon is not a license for some to minister and others to be passive.
* Valuing the Lord&#x27;s Supper occurring as a regular, recurring full meal celebration rather than a short religious ritual. The early integration of the home based ritual into the public synagogue-like meeting functioned to reduce the symbolic nature of the act to a private moment, replacing its symbolism of fellowship and dedication to the Lord. This was complete by the time of Constantine, when home based agape feasts were banned. However, this history does not in itself devalue the need for the larger synagogue-like meeting for prayer, ministry of the word and singing. Simple church adherents also enjoy occasional and even monthly larger gatherings that do this very thing, though they emphasize the smaller meeting of the ekklesia as the environment for spiritual growth.
* Organic churches tend to place less emphasis on the building or meeting place. To this end, Neil Cole, an adherent of simple church, states that &quot;buildings, budgets, and big shots,&quot; tend to do more to contain Christianity than allow it to spread. However, this statement against larger sized churches does nothing to substantiate its claim.

===Media and popular attention===
In the early twenty–first century the growth of the movement had increased news media coverage during the early 2000&#x27;s. However, the house church movement saw a resurgence following the Covid-19 epidemic, after Christian believers were forced to meet in more intimate, home-like settings, and after the traditional Westernized church model seemed to fail to meet members&#x27; needs during and after the epidemic:

Many books have been written on the simple church movement, especially by insiders (see House Church, Further Reading). In the early twenty-first century, books began to appear by those studying the movement from a more objective view, including George Barna&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot;. Barna says that &quot;revolutionary&quot; expressions such as simple church will soon account for one third of American spirituality.

Visibility of the movement also increased due to national and regional gatherings of various kinds. Among which include the Church Without Walls International in Broken Arrow, OK, USA, and various other locations throughout the US.

===Criticism===
How the simple church movement relates to constructing a theology and ecclesiology is the subject of much debate, especially with critics of the movement.

Several prominent voices have serious concerns about simple church. For example, J. Lee Grady (Charisma Online Editor) says such a movement wants to &quot;reinvent the church without its biblical structure and New Testament order – and without the necessary people who are anointed and appointed by God to lead it. To follow this defective thesis to its logical conclusion would require us to fire all pastors, close all seminaries and Bible colleges, padlock our sanctuaries and send everybody home...&quot; Grady and other critics worry that the simple church movement could encourage people to leave more traditional forms of church, which could lead to further collapse or decline of Christendom.

<text>The Nicaraguan Revolution () began with rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the ouster of the dictatorship in 1978–79, and fighting between the government and the Contras from 1981 to 1990. The revolution revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War.

The initial overthrow of the Somoza dictatorial regime in 1978–79 cost many lives, and the Contra War of the 1980s took tens of thousands more and was the subject of fierce international debate. Because of the political turmoil, failing economy, and limited government influence, during the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received aid from the Soviet Union and the United States.

A peace process started with the Sapoá Accords in 1988 and the Contra War ended after the signing of the Tela Accord in 1989 and the demobilization of the FSLN and Contra armies. A second election in 1990 resulted in the election of a majority of anti-Sandinista parties and the FSLN lost power.

==Somoza family==

Following the United States occupation of Nicaragua in 1912 during the Banana Wars, the Somoza family political dynasty took power, and ruled from 1937 until its ouster in 1979. The Somoza dynasty consisted of Anastasio Somoza García, his eldest son Luis Somoza Debayle, and finally Anastasio Somoza Debayle. The Somoza era was characterized by economic development, albeit with rising inequality and political corruption, strong US support for the government and its military, as well as a reliance on US-based multinational corporations.

== Sandinista National Liberation Front ==
In 1961 Carlos Fonseca Amador, Silvio Mayorga, and Tomás Borge Martínez formed the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) with other student activists at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua (UNAN) in Managua. The founders were experienced activists. Amador, first General Secretary, had worked with others on a newspaper &quot;broadly critical&quot; of the Somoza reign titled &quot;Segovia&quot;.

Consisting of approximately 20 members during the 1960s, with the help of students, FSLN gathered support from peasants and anti-Somoza elements, as well as from the communist Cuban government, the socialist Panamanian government of Omar Torrijos, and the social democratic Venezuelan government of Carlos Andrés Pérez.

By the 1970s the coalition of students, farmers, businesses, churches, and a small percentage of Marxists was strong enough to launch a military effort against the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle. FSLN focused on guerrilla tactics, inspired by Fidel Castro and Ché Guevara. They launched an unsuccessful the Río Coco/Bocay-Raití campaign: &quot;when guerrillas did encounter the National Guard, they had to retreat...with heavy losses.&quot; Further operations included a devastating loss near the city of Matagalpa, during which Mayorga was killed. During this time, FSLN reduced attacks, instead focusing on solidifying the organization.

Fonseca died in combat in November 1976. The FSLN then split into three factions that fought separately: the Maoist Tendencia GPP (Guerra Popular Prolongada) (English: Prolonged People&#x27;s War); Marxist-Leninist Tendencia Proletaria (English: proletarian); and Left-wing nationalist Tendencia Tercerista (English: third).

==Revolution==

In the 1970s, FSLN began a campaign of kidnappings, which led to national recognition of the group in the Nicaraguan media and solidification of the group as a force. The regime, which included the Nicaraguan National Guard, trained by the U.S. military, declared a state of siege, and proceeded to use torture, rape, extrajudicial killings, intimidation and press censorship in order to combat the FSLN attacks. This led to international condemnation of the regime and in 1978 the US cut off aid over its human rights violations. In response, Somoza lifted the state of siege.

Other opposition parties and movements began to consolidate. In 1974, the &quot;Unión Democrática Liberal&quot; (UDEL; English: Union for Democratic Liberation) was founded by Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, editor of the Managua newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot;. The alliance included two anti-Somoza liberal parties as well as conservatives and the Nicaraguan Socialist Party.

On 10 January 1978 Cardenal was murdered, allegedly by the Somoza regime, and riots broke out in Managua targeting the Somoza regime. Following the riots, a general strike on 23–24 January called for the end of the Somoza regime and was successful at shutting down around 80% of businesses in Managua and the provincial capitals of León, Granada, Chinandega, and Matagalpa.

In the words of William Dewy, a Citi Bank employee who witnessed the Managua riots:

On 22 August 1978 the FSLN staged a massive kidnapping operation. Led by Éden Pastora, the Sandinistan forces captured the National Palace while the legislature was in session, taking 2,000 hostages. Pastora demanded money, the release of Sandinistan prisoners, and &quot;a means of publicizing the Sandinista cause.&quot; After two days, the government agreed to pay $500,000 and to release certain prisoners, a major victory for the FSLN. Revolts against the state and guerrilla warfare continued.

In early 1979 the Organization of American States supervised negotiations between the FSLN and the government. However, these broke down when it became clear that the Somoza regime had no intention of allowing democratic elections.

By June 1979, following a successful urban offensive, the FSLN militarily controlled all of the country except the capital. On 17 July President Somoza resigned, and on 19 July the FSLN entered Managua, ceding control to the revolutionary movements. Somoza fled to Miami; his Nationalist Liberal Party became practically defunct, and many government functionaries and business figures overtly compromised with &quot;somocismo&quot; chose exile. The Catholic church and the professional sectors generally approved of the new reality.

==Sandinista government==
Immediately following the fall of the Somoza regime, Nicaragua lay largely in ruins. The country had suffered both war and, earlier, natural disaster in the devastating 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. In 1979, approximately 600,000 Nicaraguans were homeless and 150,000 more were either refugees or in exile, out of a total population of just 2.8 million.

In response, a state of emergency was declared. The US sent US$99 million in aid. Land and businesses of the Somoza regime were expropriated, the courts were abolished, and workers were organized into Civil Defense Committees. The new regime declared that &quot;elections are unnecessary&quot;, which led to criticism from the Catholic Church and others.

===Agrarian reform===

The Somocista regime had created a big and modern center, Managua, surrounding an almost semifeudal rural economy with few productive outputs, including cotton, sugar and other agricultural products. All sectors of the economy of Nicaragua were determined, in great part, by the Somozas or their supporters, whether by directly owning agricultural brands/trusts, or actively choosing their owners (local or foreign). Somoza himself was (incorrectly) alleged to have owned 1/5 of all profitable land in Nicaragua. Somoza or his people did own or give away banks, ports, communications, services and massive amounts of land.

The Nicaraguan Revolution brought immense restructuring to all three sectors of the economy, directing it towards a mixed economy. The biggest economic impact was on agriculture, in the form of agrarian reform, which was proposed as a process that would develop pragmatically along with other changes (economic, political, etc.).

Economic reforms overall needed to restart the economy. As a developing country, Nicaragua had an agriculture-based economy, susceptible to commodity market prices. The rural economy was far behind in technology and devastated by the guerrilla warfare.

Article 1 of the Agrarian Reform Law says that property is guaranteed if it is used efficiently and described different forms of property:

* state property (confiscated land from Somocistas)
* cooperative property (confiscated land, but without individual certificates of ownership, to be used efficiently)
* communal property (for people and communities from Miskito regions in the Atlantic)
* individual property (as long as it was efficiently used and integrated to national development plans)

The principles that defined the reform matched those of the Revolution: pluralism, national unity, and economic democracy.

Agrarian reform developed in four phases:
# phase (1979): confiscation of property owned by Somocistas and its partners
# phase (1981): Agrarian Reform Law of 19 July 1981
# phase (1984–85): massive cession of land individually
# phase (1986): Agrarian Reform Law of 1986, or &quot;reform to the 1981 Law&quot;

In 1985, the Agrarian Reform distributed of land to the peasantry. This represented about 75 percent of all land distributed to peasants since 1980. The reform had the twofold purpose of increasing support for the government among the &quot;campesinos&quot;, and guaranteeing ample food delivery into the cities. During 1985, ceremonies were held throughout the countryside in which Daniel Ortega gave each peasant title to land and a rifle to defend it.

===Cultural revolution===
The Revolution brought many cultural developments. The Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign &quot;(Cruzada Nacional de Alfabetización)&quot; focused on secondary school and university students drafting teachers as volunteer teachers. Within five months they claimed to have reduced the overall illiteracy rate from 50.3% to 12.9%. In September 1980, UNESCO awarded Nicaragua the &quot;Nadezhda K. Krupskaya&quot; award. This was followed by literacy campaigns of 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995 and 2000, each of which was also awarded by UNESCO.

The Sandinistas established a Ministry of Culture, one of only three in Latin America at the time, and established a new editorial brand, called &quot;Editorial Nueva Nicaragua&quot; and, based on it, started to print cheap editions of basic books rarely seen by Nicaraguans. It founded an &quot;Instituto de Estudios del Sandinismo&quot; (Institute for Studies of Sandinismo) where it printed the work and papers of Augusto C. Sandino and those that reflected the ideologies of FSLN, such as Carlos Fonseca and Ricardo Morales Avilés.

Such programs received international recognition for improving literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform.

=== Human rights controversies ===

Amnesty International noted numerous human rights violations by the Sandinista government. They contended that civilians &quot;disappeared&quot; after their arrest, that &quot;civil and political rights&quot; were suspended, due process was denied detainees, detainees were tortured, and &quot;reports of the killing by government forces of those suspected of supporting the contras&quot;.

The Sandinistas were accused of mass executions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights investigated abuses by Sandinista forces, including an execution of 35 to 40 Miskitos in December 1981, and an execution of 75 people in November 1984. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that &quot;...the Miskitos began to actively oppose the Sandinistas in 1982 when authorities killed more than a dozen Indians, burned villages, forcibly recruited young men into the army and tried to relocate others. Thousands of Miskitos poured across the Coco into Honduras, and many took up arms to oppose the Nicaraguan government.&quot;

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative American think tank with close ties to the Ronald Reagan administration, charged the Sandinista government with human rights violations, including press censorship. It charged that the government censored the independent newspaper &quot;La Prensa.&quot; French journalist Viktor Dedaj, who lived in Managua in the 1980s, contended that &quot;La Prensa&quot; was generally sold freely and that the majority of radio stations were anti-Sandinista. The Heritage Foundation claimed that the Sandinistas instituted a &quot;spy on your neighbor&quot; system that encouraged citizens to report any activity deemed counter-revolutionary, with those reported facing harassment from security representatives, including the destruction of property. Heritage also criticized the government for its treatment of the Miskito people, stating that over 15,000 Miskitos were forced to relocate, that their villages were destroyed, and that their killers were promoted rather than punished.

The United Nations, the Organization of American States and Pax Christi disputed Heritage&#x27;s allegations of anti-Semitism. According to them, individual Nicaraguan Jews had their property expropriated due to their connections with the Somoza regime, rather than because they were Jewish. They cited the fact that there were prominent Sandinistas officials of Jewish descent. In contrast to these organizations, the Anti-Defamation League supported allegations of Sandinista antisemitism. It worked closely with Nicaraguan Jewish exiles to reclaim a synagogue that had been firebombed by Sandinista militants in 1978 and expropriated in 1979.

==Contras==

The Carter Administration attempted to work with FSLN in 1979 and 1980, while the Reagan Administration supported an anti-communist strategy for dealing with Latin America, and attempted to isolate the Sandinista regime economically and politically. As early as 1980–1981, anti-Sandinista forces known as Contras began forming along the Nicaragua/Honduras border. Many of the initial Contras were former members of Somoza&#x27;s National Guard and many were still loyal to Somoza, then in exile in Honduras.

In addition to Contra units loyal to Somoza, FSLN also began to face opposition from members of ethnic minority groups that inhabited Nicaragua&#x27;s remote Mosquito Coast region along the Gulf of Mexico. These groups were demanding self-determination and/or autonomy, but the FSLN refused to grant this and began using forced relocations and armed force in response.

Upon taking office in January 1981, Reagan cancelled U.S. economic aid to Nicaragua, and on 6 August 1981 he signed National Security Decision Directive 7, which authorized the production and shipment of arms to the region but not their deployment. On 17 November 1981, President Reagan signed National Security Directive 17, authorizing covert support to anti-Sandinista forces.

Armed conflict soon erupted, further destabilizing the region upset by civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The CIA-backed Contras secretly opened a &quot;second front&quot; on Nicaragua&#x27;s eastern coast and Costa Rican border. As the civil war opened cracks in the national revolutionary project, FSLN&#x27;s military budget grew to more than half of the government&#x27;s annual budget. The &quot;Servicio Militar Patriótico&quot; (Patriotic Military Service), a compulsory draft, was also established.

By 1982, Contra forces had begun carrying out assassinations of members of the Nicaraguan government, and by 1983 the Contras had launched a major offensive. The CIA was helping them to plant mines in Nicaragua harbors to inhibit foreign weapons shipments. The 1987 Iran–Contra affair placed the Reagan Administration again at the center of secret support for the Contras.

===1984 general election===

The 1984 Nicaraguan general election took place on 4 November. Of the 1,551,597 citizens registered in July, 1,170,142 voted (75.4%). Null votes were 6% of the total. International observers declared the elections free and fair, although the Reagan administration denounced it as a &quot;Soviet style sham&quot;. The national share of valid votes for president were:
* Daniel Ortega, Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) – 67.0%
* Clemente Guido, Democratic Conservative Party (PCD) – 14.0%
* Virgilio Godoy, Independent Liberal Party (PLI) – 9.6%
* Mauricio Diaz, Popular Social Christian Party (PPSC) – 5.6%
* Allan Zambrana, Nicaraguan Communist Party (PCdeN) – 1.5%
* Domingo Sánchez Sancho, Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) – 1.3%
* Isidro Téllez, Marxist–Leninist Popular Action Movement (MAP-ML) – 1.0%

===Esquipulas Peace Agreement===

The Esquipulas Peace Agreement was a mid-1980s initiative to settle the military conflicts that had plagued Central America for many years, and in some cases (notably Guatemala) for decades. It built upon groundwork laid by the Contadora Group from 1983 to 1985. The agreement was named for Esquipulas, Guatemala, where the initial meetings took place. US Congress efforts were helped by Capitol Hill lobbyist William C. Chasey.

In May 1986, summit meeting Esquipulas I took place, attended by the five Central American presidents. On 15 February 1987, Costa Rican President Óscar Arias submitted a Peace Plan that evolved from this meeting. During 1986 and 1987, the Esquipulas Process was established, in which the Central American heads of state agreed on economic cooperation and a framework for peaceful conflict resolution. The Esquipulas II Accord emerged from this and was signed in Guatemala City by the five presidents on 7 August 1987.

Esquipulas II defined measures to promote national reconciliation, an end to hostilities, democratization, free elections, the termination of all assistance to irregular forces, negotiations on arms controls, and assistance to refugees. It laid the ground for international verification procedures and provided a timetable for implementation.

The Sapoá Accords at March 23, 1988 represented the beginning of a peace process in Nicaragua. The name of the accords comes from Sapoá, a Nicaraguan town near the border with Costa Rica. Sandinismo in 1988 was coming to an end as the Soviet Union began limiting its support. This in turn limited Sandinista government options to continue the conflict, forcing them to negotiate for peace. The accord was mediated by João Clemente Baena Soares at the time as Secretary General of the Organization of American States and then Archbishop of Managua Miguel Obando y Bravo Since Nicaraguan conflict was a proxy war between the USSR and the US. Peace process management relied on then Soviet ambassador Vaino Väljas&#x27; mediation depending on recent US-Soviet agreements since US did not have an Ambassador to Nicaragua from July 1, 1987 till May 4, 1988.

===National Opposition Union (UNO)===


In the 1990 Nicaraguan general election, the UNO Coalition included:

*3 Liberal factions: PLI, PLC and PALI
*3 Conservative: ANC, PNC and APC
*3 Social-Christians: PPSC, PDCN and PAN
*2 Social democrats: PSD and MDN
*2 Communists: PSN (pro-Moscow) and PC de Nicaragua (pro-Albania)
*1 Central American Unionist: PIAC

<text>Pro Evolution Soccer 4 (known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 8 in Japan and World Soccer: Winning Eleven 8 International in North America) is the fourth installment of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer&quot; football simulation video game series. It&#x27;s the first game of the series to appear on the original Xbox, with online gameplay.

The Japanese version cover features Zico for the second time in a row.

The European version cover features Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, AS Roma forward Francesco Totti, and world-renowned Italian referee Pierluigi Collina. It was the first game in the series to feature licensed leagues.

&quot;Winning Eleven 8: Liveware Evolution&quot; marked the first game in the &quot;PES&quot; series to feature online play for the PlayStation 2, while &quot;Winning Eleven 8/Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot; does not feature it. Within online play, statistics and league points are stored on the server for each game played. &quot;PES 4&quot; was succeeded by &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 5&quot;, which was released in 2005.

==Features==
*Expanded Master League teams containing up to 72 teams. More elements added to the development and retirement of master league players. Winning a game in Master League will raise the abilities of your players.
*A total of more than 200 club and national teams
*Three fully licensed leagues (Serie A, Eredivisie and Liga Española).
*For the first time, Referees will be seen on pitch during the game. There is also an animated linesman seen after a player is given offside. The referee will not issue a yellow card for the first &#x27;average&#x27; tackle, but if a player continues to commit &#x27;average&#x27; fouls, a card will be given
*Wear and tear including dirt will be visible on the player&#x27;s uniforms according to the pitch conditions.
*Improved edit mode allowing changes to be made to league names and the ability to put text on the kits.

==Reception==

In Japan, the PS2 version sold 1million copies on its first day of release, and eventually sold 1.11million units. In Europe, the PS2 version shipped 1.5million units on its first day of release, setting a launch sales record. It was a hit in Italy, where more than 400,000 units were sold for over or by November 2004. The PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot; received a &quot;Double Platinum&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

The game received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; on all platforms in all regions except the U.S. PC version, which received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; gave the PS2 version all five stars, stating that &quot;There are myriad ways to score, yet goals are always well-earned.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; also gave the same version all five stars, stating, &quot;The intuitive control system and [the] fluidity of the movement are of the highest standard and this year’s model includes a bag of new dribbling tricks, which are worth practising in the training mode. Even the referees have received an upgrade.&quot; BBC Sport gave the game 95% and said, &quot;Greater emphasis has been placed on one-touch play, and while goals are not all that easy to come by - creating chances requires quick thinking and accurate distribution - when you do manage to make the net bulge, it&#x27;s all the more satisfying.&quot; However, &quot;Maxim&quot; gave the game a score of eight out of ten and said, &quot;Although it&#x27;s dogged by Commodore 64-quality music and selective licensing agreements... this new edition more than compensates with killer graphics, new tricks, and an improved dribbling system.&quot; &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; gave the Xbox version three stars out of four and said that it &quot;really isn&#x27;t a leap above &quot;Winning Eleven 7&quot;. Though the variety of play modes is huge, the well-animated visuals could use some polish, the audio sounds rather bland and the number of licensed teams and players is a bit wimpy.&quot;

&quot;Winning Eleven 8&quot; was a finalist for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Sports Game 2005&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06&quot;.

<doc id="661661" wikidata="Q2915088" url="?curid=661661" title="Evolution of sexual reproduction">
<text>Sexually reproducing animals, plants, fungi and protists are thought to have evolved from a common ancestor that was a single-celled eukaryotic species. Sexual reproduction is widespread in eukaryotes, though a few eukaryotic species have secondarily lost the ability to reproduce sexually, such as Bdelloidea, and some plants and animals routinely reproduce asexually (by apomixis and parthenogenesis) without entirely having lost sex. The evolution of sexual reproduction contains two related yet distinct themes: its &quot;origin&quot; and its &quot;maintenance.&quot; Bacteria and Archaea (prokaryotes) have processes that can transfer DNA from one cell to another (conjugation, transformation, and transduction), but it is unclear if these processes are evolutionarily related to sexual reproduction in Eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, true sexual reproduction by meiosis and cell fusion is thought to have arisen in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, possibly via several processes of varying success, and then to have persisted.

Since hypotheses for the origin of sex are difficult to verify experimentally (outside of evolutionary computation), most current work has focused on the persistence of sexual reproduction over evolutionary time. The maintenance of sexual reproduction (specifically, of its dioecious form) by natural selection in a highly competitive world has long been one of the major mysteries of biology, since both other known mechanisms of reproduction – asexual reproduction and hermaphroditism – possess apparent advantages over it. Asexual reproduction can proceed by budding, fission, or spore formation and does not involve the union of gametes, which accordingly results in a much faster rate of reproduction compared to sexual reproduction, where 50% of offspring are males and unable to produce offspring themselves. In hermaphroditic reproduction, each of the two parent organisms required for the formation of a zygote can provide either the male or the female gamete, which leads to advantages in both size and genetic variance of a population.

Sexual reproduction therefore must offer significant fitness advantages because, despite the two-fold cost of sex (see below), it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced by sexual processes outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganised and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is always identical to the parents (barring mutation). Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: &quot;recombinational DNA repair&quot; (promoted during meiosis because homologous chromosomes pair at that time) and &quot;complementation&quot; (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigour or masking of mutations).

==Historical perspective==
Reproduction, including modes of sexual reproduction, features in the writings of Aristotle; modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least Erasmus Darwin (1731–1802) in the 18th century. August Weismann picked up the thread in 1885, arguing that sex serves to generate genetic variation, as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) concluded that the effect of hybrid vigor (complementation) &quot;is amply sufficient to account for the … genesis of the two sexes&quot;. This is consistent with the repair and complementation hypothesis, described below. Since the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 20th century, numerous biologists including W. D. Hamilton, Alexey Kondrashov, George C. Williams, Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein, Michael M. Cox, Frederic A. Hopf and Richard E. Michod – have suggested competing explanations for how a vast array of different living species maintain sexual reproduction.

==Advantages of sex and sexual reproduction==

The concept of sex includes two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation of this information into two parts). Depending on the presence or absence of these phenomena, all of the existing forms of reproduction can be classified as asexual, hermaphrodite or dioecious. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.

Reproductive advantages of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny, and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms are in maximal diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity. So, the primary challenge is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages over asexual reproduction, there should be some important advantages in evolution.

===Advantages due to genetic variation, DNA repair and genetic complementation===

For the advantage due to genetic variation, there are three possible reasons this might happen. First, sexual reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial mutations in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits) without the mutations having to have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants. Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.

For the advantage due to DNA repair, there is an immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational DNA repair during meiosis (assuming the initial mutation rate is higher than optimal), since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of complementation to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.

The classes of hypotheses based on the creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not mutually exclusive), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms are acting in each species.

On the other hand, the maintenance of sex based on DNA repair and complementation applies widely to all sexual species.

===Protection from major genetic mutation===
In contrast to the view that sex promotes genetic variation, Heng, and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex actually acts as a constraint on genetic variation. They consider that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve.

===Novel genotypes===


Sex could be a method by which novel genotypes are created. Because sex combines genes from two individuals, sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual populations. If, in a sexual population, two different advantageous alleles arise at different loci on a chromosome in different members of the population, a chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can be produced within a few generations by recombination. However, should the same two alleles arise in different members of an asexual population, the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele is to independently gain the same mutation, which would take much longer. Several studies have addressed counterarguments, and the question of whether this model is sufficiently robust to explain the predominance of sexual versus asexual reproduction remains.

Ronald Fisher suggested that sex might facilitate the spread of advantageous genes by allowing them to better escape their genetic surroundings, if they should arise on a chromosome with deleterious genes.

Supporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too – which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the heterogamous water fleas of the genus &quot;Cladocera&quot;, sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.

===Increased resistance to parasites===
One of the most widely discussed theories to explain the persistence of sex is that it is maintained to assist sexual individuals in resisting parasites, also known as the Red Queen Hypothesis.

When an environment changes, previously neutral or deleterious alleles can become favourable. If the environment changed sufficiently rapidly (i.e. between generations), these changes in the environment can make sex advantageous for the individual. Such rapid changes in environment are caused by the co-evolution between hosts and parasites.

Imagine, for example that there is one gene in parasites with two alleles &quot;p&quot; and &quot;P&quot; conferring two types of parasitic ability, and one gene in hosts with two alleles &quot;h&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, conferring two types of parasite resistance, such that parasites with allele &quot;p&quot; can attach themselves to hosts with the allele &quot;h&quot;, and &quot;P&quot; to &quot;H&quot;. Such a situation will lead to cyclic changes in allele frequency – as &quot;p&quot; increases in frequency, &quot;h&quot; will be disfavoured.

In reality, there will be several genes involved in the relationship between hosts and parasites. In an asexual population of hosts, offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance if a mutation arises. In a sexual population of hosts, however, offspring will have a new combination of parasitic resistance alleles.

In other words, like Lewis Carroll&#x27;s Red Queen, sexual hosts are continually &quot;running&quot; (adapting) to &quot;stay in one place&quot; (resist parasites).

Evidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for kinases and immunoglobulins in the immune system with genes coding other proteins. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.

Further evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long-term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a &quot;mixed&quot; (sexual and asexual) population of snails (&quot;Potamopyrgus antipodarum&quot;). The number of sexuals, the number asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.

However, Hanley et al. studied mite infestations of a parthenogenetic gecko species and its two related sexual ancestral species. Contrary to expectation based on the Red Queen hypothesis, they found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites in sexual geckos was significantly higher than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.

In 2011, researchers used the microscopic roundworm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot; as a host and the pathogenic bacteria &quot;Serratia marcescens&quot; to generate a host-parasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen Hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the mating system of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the &quot;S. marcescens&quot; parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of &quot;C. elegans&quot; were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis. In natural populations of &quot;C. elegans&quot;, self-fertilization is the predominant mode of reproduction, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of about 1%.

Critics of the Red Queen hypothesis question whether the constantly changing environment of hosts and parasites is sufficiently common to explain the evolution of sex. In particular, Otto and Nuismer presented results showing that species interactions (e.g. host vs parasite interactions) typically select against sex. They concluded that, although the Red Queen hypothesis favors sex under certain circumstances, it alone does not account for the ubiquity of sex. Otto and Gerstein further stated that &quot;it seems doubtful to us that strong selection per gene is sufficiently commonplace for the Red Queen hypothesis to explain the ubiquity of sex&quot;. Parker reviewed numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance and failed to uncover a single example consistent with the assumptions of the Red Queen hypothesis.

==Disadvantages of sex and sexual reproduction==
The paradox of the existence of sexual reproduction is that though it is ubiquitous in multicellular organisms, there are ostensibly many inherent disadvantages to reproducing sexually when weighed against the relative advantages of alternative forms of reproduction, such as asexual reproduction. Thus, because sexual reproduction abounds in complex multicellular life, there must be some significant benefit(s) to sex and sexual reproduction that compensates for these fundamental disadvantages.

===Population expansion cost of sex===
Among the most limiting disadvantages to the evolution of sexual reproduction by natural selection is that an asexual population can grow much more rapidly than a sexual one with each generation.

For example, assume that the entire population of a theoretical species has 100 total organisms consisting of two sexes (i.e. males and females), with 50:50 male-to-female representation, and that only the females of this species can bear offspring. If all capable members of this population procreated once, a total of 50 offspring would be produced (the &quot;F1&quot; generation). Contrast this outcome with an asexual species, in which each and every member of an equally sized 100-organism population is capable of bearing young. If all capable members of this asexual population procreated once, a total of 100 offspring would be produced – twice as many as produced by the sexual population in a single generation.
This idea is sometimes referred to as the two-fold cost of sexual reproduction. It was first described mathematically by John Maynard Smith. In his manuscript, Smith further speculated on the impact of an asexual mutant arising in a sexual population, which suppresses meiosis and allows eggs to develop into offspring genetically identical to the mother by mitotic division. The mutant-asexual lineage would double its representation in the population each generation, all else being equal.

Technically the problem above is not one of sexual reproduction but of having a subset of organisms incapable of bearing offspring. Indeed, some multicellular organisms (isogamous) engage in sexual reproduction but all members of the species are capable of bearing offspring. The two-fold reproductive disadvantage assumes that males contribute only genes to their offspring and sexual females spend half their reproductive potential on sons. Thus, in this formulation, the principal cost of sex is that males and females must successfully copulate, which almost always involves expending energy to come together through time and space. Asexual organisms need not expend the energy necessary to find a mate.

===Selfish cytoplasmic genes===

Sexual reproduction implies that chromosomes and alleles segregate and recombine in every generation, but not all genes are transmitted together to the offspring. There is a chance of spreading mutants that cause unfair transmission at the expense of their non-mutant colleagues. These mutations are referred to as &quot;selfish&quot; because they promote their own spread at the cost of alternative alleles or of the host organism; they include nuclear meiotic drivers and selfish cytoplasmic genes. Meiotic drivers are genes that distort meiosis to produce gametes containing themselves more than the 50% of the time expected by chance. A selfish cytoplasmic gene is a gene located in an organelle, plasmid or intracellular parasite that modifies reproduction to cause its own increase at the expense of the cell or organism that carries it.

===Genetic heritability cost of sex===
A sexually reproducing organism only passes on ~50% of its own genetic material to each L2 offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are haploid. Again, however, this is not applicable to all sexual organisms. There are numerous species which are sexual but do not have a genetic-loss problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are isogamous sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.

Some species avoid the 50% cost of sexual reproduction, although they have &quot;sex&quot; (in the sense of genetic recombination). In these species (e.g., bacteria, ciliates, dinoflagellates and diatoms), &quot;sex&quot; and reproduction occur separately.

==DNA repair and complementation==
As discussed in the earlier part of this article, sexual reproduction is conventionally explained as an adaptation for producing genetic variation through allelic recombination. As acknowledged above, however, serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists to conclude that the benefit of sex is a major unsolved problem in evolutionary biology.

An alternative &quot;informational&quot; approach to this problem has led to the view that the two fundamental aspects of sex, genetic recombination and outcrossing, are adaptive responses to the two major sources of &quot;noise&quot; in transmitting genetic information. Genetic noise can occur as either physical damage to the genome (e.g. chemically altered bases of DNA or breaks in the chromosome) or replication errors (mutations). This alternative view is referred to as the repair and complementation hypothesis, to distinguish it from the traditional variation hypothesis.

The repair and complementation hypothesis assumes that genetic recombination is fundamentally a DNA repair process, and that when it occurs during meiosis it is an adaptation for repairing the genomic DNA which is passed on to progeny. Recombinational repair is the only repair process known which can accurately remove double-strand damages in DNA, and such damages are both common in nature and ordinarily lethal if not repaired. For instance, double-strand breaks in DNA occur about 50 times per cell cycle in human cells (see naturally occurring DNA damage). Recombinational repair is prevalent from the simplest viruses to the most complex multicellular eukaryotes. It is effective against many different types of genomic damage, and in particular is highly efficient at overcoming double-strand damages. Studies of the mechanism of meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA. These considerations form the basis for the first part of the repair and complementation hypothesis.

In some lines of descent from the earliest organisms, the diploid stage of the sexual cycle, which was at first transient, became the predominant stage, because it allowed complementation — the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. hybrid vigor or heterosis). Outcrossing, the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of inbreeding (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as inbreeding depression). This is in accord with Charles Darwin, who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, &quot;the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents.&quot;

However, outcrossing may be abandoned in favor of parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when there has been a forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.

In the view of the repair and complementation hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.

==Deleterious mutation clearance==
Mutations can have many different effects upon an organism. It is generally believed that the majority of non-neutral mutations are deleterious, which means that they will cause a decrease in the organism&#x27;s overall fitness. If a mutation has a deleterious effect, it will then usually be removed from the population by the process of natural selection. Sexual reproduction is believed to be more efficient than asexual reproduction in removing those mutations from the genome.

There are two main hypotheses which explain how sex may act to remove deleterious genes from the genome.

===Evading harmful mutation build-up===

While DNA is able to recombine to modify alleles, DNA is also susceptible to mutations within the sequence that can affect an organism in a negative manner. Asexual organisms do not have the ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms.

Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination. These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parents. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.

For sexually reproducing populations, studies have shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals. Instead, the mutation is only passed onto one individual. Further studies using &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to kin selection. The studies with &quot;D. discoideum&quot; showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.

===Removal of deleterious genes===

This hypothesis was proposed by Alexey Kondrashov, and is sometimes known as the &quot;deterministic mutation hypothesis&quot;. It assumes that the majority of deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as &quot;synergistic epistasis&quot;.

By way of analogy, think of a car with several minor faults. Each is not sufficient alone to prevent the car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to prevent the car from functioning.

Similarly, an organism may be able to cope with a few defects, but the presence of many mutations could overwhelm its backup mechanisms.

Kondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Sex will act to recombine these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.

There has been much criticism of Kondrashov&#x27;s theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires that the rate of deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in Drosophila and E. coli), there is also strong evidence against it. Thus, for instance, for the sexual species &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (yeast) and &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; (fungus), the mutation rate per genome per replication are 0.0027 and 0.0030 respectively. For the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation is 0.036. Secondly, there should be strong interactions among loci (synergistic epistasis), a mutation-fitness relation for which there is only limited evidence. Conversely, there is also the same amount of evidence that mutations show no epistasis (purely additive model) or antagonistic interactions (each additional mutation has a disproportionally &quot;small&quot; effect).

==Other explanations==
===Geodakyan&#x27;s evolutionary theory of sex===
Geodakyan suggested that sexual dimorphism provides a partitioning of a species&#x27; phenotypes into at least two functional partitions: a female partition that secures beneficial features of the species and a male partition that emerged in species with more variable and unpredictable environments. The male partition is suggested to be an &quot;experimental&quot; part of the species that allows the species to expand their ecological niche, and to have alternative configurations. This theory underlines the higher variability and higher mortality in males, in comparison to females. This functional partitioning also explains the higher susceptibility to disease in males, in comparison to females and therefore includes the idea of &quot;protection against parasites&quot; as another functionality of male sex. Geodakyan&#x27;s evolutionary theory of sex was developed in Russia in 1960–1980 and was not known to the West till the era of the Internet. Trofimova, who analysed psychological sex differences, hypothesised that the male sex might also provide a &quot;redundancy pruning&quot; function.

===Speed of evolution===
Ilan Eshel suggested that sex prevents rapid evolution. He suggests that recombination breaks up favourable gene combinations more often than it creates them, and sex is maintained because it ensures selection is longer-term than in asexual populations – so the population is less affected by short-term changes. This explanation is not widely accepted, as its assumptions are very restrictive.

It has recently been shown in experiments with &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot; algae that sex can remove the speed limit on evolution.

An information theoretic analysis using a simplified but useful model shows that in asexual reproduction, the information gain per generation of a species is limited to 1 bit per generation, while in sexual reproduction, the information gain is bounded by where formula_1 is the size of the genome in bits.

===Libertine bubble theory===
The evolution of sex can alternatively be described as a kind of gene exchange that is independent from reproduction. According to the Thierry Lodé&#x27;s &quot;libertine bubble theory&quot;, sex originated from an archaic gene transfer process among prebiotic bubbles. The contact among the pre-biotic bubbles could, through simple food or parasitic reactions, promote the transfer of genetic material from one bubble to another. That interactions between two organisms be in balance appear to be a sufficient condition to make these interactions evolutionarily efficient, i.e. to select bubbles that tolerate these interactions (&quot;libertine&quot; bubbles) through a blind evolutionary process of self-reinforcing gene correlations and compatibility.

The &quot;libertine bubble theory&quot; proposes that meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes to solve a problem that bacteria did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. So that, rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could be thought of as a series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, gametogenesis and syngamy. Therefore, current sexual species could be descendants of primitive organisms that practiced more stable exchanges in the long term, while asexual species have emerged, much more recently in evolutionary history, from the conflict of interest resulting from anisogamy.

Parasites and Muller&#x27;s ratchet

R. Stephen Howard and Curtis Lively were the first to suggest that the combined effects of parasitism and mutation accumulation can lead to an increased advantage to sex under conditions not otherwise predicted (Nature, 1994). Using computer simulations, they showed that when the two mechanisms act simultaneously the advantage to sex over asexual reproduction is larger than for either factor operating alone.

==Origin of sexual reproduction==

Many protists reproduce sexually, as do many multicellular plants, animals, and fungi. In the eukaryotic fossil record, sexual reproduction first appeared about 2.0 billion years ago in the Proterozoic Eon, although a later date, 1.2 billion years ago, has also been presented. Nonetheless, all sexually reproducing eukaryotic organisms likely derive from a single-celled common ancestor. It is probable that the evolution of sex was an integral part of the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell. There are a few species which have secondarily lost this feature, such as Bdelloidea and some parthenocarpic plants.

===Diploidy===
Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. Diploid individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via homologous recombination, since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and if one copy is damaged, the other copy is unlikely to be damaged at the same site.

A harmful damage in a haploid individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become fixed (i.e. permanent), since any DNA repair mechanism would have no source from which to recover the original undamaged sequence. The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.

===Meiosis===

Sexual reproduction appears to have arisen very early in eukaryotic evolution, implying that the essential features of meiosis were already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in natural transformation in bacteria and DNA transfer in archaea. For example, recA recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination

Natural transformation in bacteria, DNA transfer in archaea, and meiosis in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion, and DNA damaging conditions. This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see Natural competence) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients&#x27; damaged DNA.

If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge to the survival of early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition, and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation or archaeal DNA transfer naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.

===Virus-like RNA-based origin===
Sex might also have been present even earlier, in the hypothesized RNA world that preceded DNA cellular life forms. One proposed origin of sex in the RNA world was based on the type of sexual interaction that is known to occur in extant single-stranded segmented RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, and in extant double-stranded segmented RNA viruses such as reovirus.

Exposure to conditions that cause RNA damage could have led to blockage of replication and death of these early RNA life forms. Sex would have allowed re-assortment of segments between two individuals with damaged RNA, permitting undamaged combinations of RNA segments to come together, thus allowing survival. Such a regeneration phenomenon, known as multiplicity reactivation, occurs in the influenza virus and reovirus.

===Parasitic DNA elements===
Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from selfish parasitic genetic elements that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g. yeast, filamentous fungi).

Bacterial conjugation is a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as &quot;sex&quot;, but technically is not a form of reproduction, even though it is a form of horizontal gene transfer. However, it does support the &quot;selfish gene&quot; part theory, since the gene itself is propagated through the F-plasmid.

A similar origin of sexual reproduction is proposed to have evolved in ancient haloarchaea as a combination of two independent processes: jumping genes and plasmid swapping.

===Partial predation===
A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of cannibalism: One primitive organism ate another one, but instead of completely digesting it, some of the eaten organism&#x27;s DNA was incorporated into the DNA of the eater.

===Vaccination-like process===

Sex may also be derived from another prokaryotic process. A comprehensive theory called &quot;origin of sex as vaccination&quot; proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection, when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by other, more virulent symbionts.

Consequently, sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) would evolve as a host strategy for uncoupling from (and thereby render impotent) the acquired symbiotic/parasitic genes.

==Mechanistic origin of sexual reproduction==
While theories positing fitness benefits that led to the origin of sex are often problematic, several theories addressing the emergence of the mechanisms of sexual reproduction have been proposed.

===Viral eukaryogenesis===

The viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory proposes that eukaryotic cells arose from a combination of a lysogenic virus, an archaean, and a bacterium. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaean and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm, but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a mitochondrion.

For these transformations to lead to the eukaryotic cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short telomeric repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the cytoplasm. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.

Meiotic division in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus as a result of its inability to enter into the lytic cycle. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.) The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.

The two viruses established in the cell would initiate replication in response to signals from the host cell. A mitosis-like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes dissolved, at which point linear chromosomes would be bound together with centromeres. The homologous nature of the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping of both sets into tetrads. It is speculated that this grouping may be the origin of crossing over, characteristic of the first division in modern meiosis. The partitioning apparatus of the mitotic-like cell cycle the cells used to replicate independently would then pull each set of chromosomes to one side of the cell, still bound by centromeres. These centromeres would prevent their replication in subsequent division, resulting in four daughter cells with one copy of one of the two original pox-like viruses. The process resulting from combination of two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics meiosis.

===Neomuran revolution===
An alternative theory, proposed by Thomas Cavalier-Smith, was labeled the Neomuran revolution. The designation &quot;Neomuran revolution&quot; refers to the appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because they are based on the &quot;theoretically and empirically&quot; unsound model of molecular clocks. Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy(billion years), until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of nucleosomes. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.

==Questions==
Some questions biologists have attempted to answer include:
* Why does sexual reproduction exist, if in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to asexual reproduction?
* Did mating types (types of gametes, according to their compatibility) arise as a result of anisogamy (gamete dimorphism), or did mating types evolve before anisogamy?
* Why do most sexual organisms use a binary mating system? Grouping itself offers a survival advantage. A binary recognition based system is the most simple and effective method in maintaining species grouping. 
* Why do some organisms have gamete dimorphism?

<text>Kenny Blank (born September 15, 1977), also known as Kenn Michael, is an American actor, composer, director, editor, and producer. He is best known for his role as Michael Peterson in the television series &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot; from 1995 to 1997 for which he also composed some music, as well as his appearance in Eddie Murphy&#x27;s 1992 film, &quot;Boomerang&quot;.

==Early life==
Blank was born as Kenneth Michael Benbow Blank in New York City on September 15, 1977, the son of Lola, a dancer for James Brown who later became Blank&#x27;s manager, and Warren Benbow, a jazz drummer who has worked with Miles Davis and Stevie Wonder. His parents later divorced and Blank was raised by his mother and stepfather, Bob Blank, who owned a music studio.

By the time he was 6 years old, Blank played the piano and made short films. He graduated from Stamford High School in 1995. In the late 1990s, Blank was a student at the University of Southern California, where he studied filmmaking.

==Career==
Blank began acting at the age of 7. As a child, Blank reviewed the book &quot;Jumanji&quot; on &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; in the episode about the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade. He also narrated Bill Martin Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Knots on a Counting Rope&quot; with Joseph Ruben Silverbird. His major breakthrough was his role as Tito in the 1991 Joe Pesci film &quot;The Super&quot;. For his performance as Tito, Blank was nominated for a Young Artist Award in 1992 in the Best Young Actor Co-starring in a Motion Picture category.

In 1991, he starred as Linus Bragg in the film &quot;Carolina Skeletons&quot; (or &quot;The End of Silence&quot;), based on the life of George Stinney, an African-American boy who was wrongfully convicted of murder and executed at the age of 14. Blank had a small role in the feature film &quot;Boomerang&quot; (1992) and appeared in the miniseries &quot;Alex Haley&#x27;s Queen&quot;.

He was a series regular on the short-lived sitcom &quot;Tall Hopes&quot; (1993), playing aspiring director Ernest Harris. Although the series received poor reviews, Blank&#x27;s performance as Ernest was well received. He portrayed teenager Michael Peterson in the sitcom &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot; in the mid-1990s, also composing songs for the series. Blank left the series after its third season.

Blank acted in &quot;Silent Story&quot; and &quot;Delivering Milo&quot;. Notable guest appearances on television shows include roles in &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;, &quot;Moesha&quot;, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, &quot;Living Single&quot;, and &quot;Freaks and Geeks&quot;. He also appeared as Jordy in the direct-to-video horror comedy &quot;Boltneck&quot;.

As a voice actor, Blank provided the voice of the character Darren Patterson on the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;As Told by Ginger&quot; (2000–06), as well as earning a small role in &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;, as Sulky Boy&#x27;s band member J.T. He appears in the &quot;Saints Row&quot; video game series as one of the selectable voices of the Boss, the main character of the series. Blank provided the English dub voice of Angelino in &quot;Mutafukaz&quot;. He is also the English dub voice of Philly the Kid in &quot;Cannon Busters&quot;.

==Other careers==
Since 1998, Blank has cinematographed, edited and directed a number of short films. He made his directorial debut in 1999 on the theme song for &quot;Mystery Men&quot;. Blank exhibited an experimental film, &quot;Manifested Intent&quot;, at the Urbanworld Film Festival. In 2019, Blank directed the television film &quot;In Broad Daylight&quot; for TV One.

During the 1990s, he also worked as a composer, creating songs on &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot; and providing the title theme for &quot;The Super&quot;. As a teenager, he contributed music to Kodak, Lego and commercials for other companies.

<text>Madeleine Talmage Dick (&quot;née&quot; Force; previously Astor, later Fiermonte; June 19, 1893 – March 27, 1940) was an American socialite and a survivor of the . She was the second wife and widow of businessman John Jacob Astor IV.

==Early life==
Madeleine Talmage Force was born on June 19, 1893, in Brooklyn, New York, the younger daughter of William Hurlbut Force (1852–1917) and the former Katherine Arvilla Talmage (1863–1930). Madeleine&#x27;s elder sister Katherine Emmons Force was a real estate businesswoman and socialite. Through her father, she had French ancestry and was a great-niece of builder Ephraim S. Force (1822 – March 12, 1914). Her mother had Dutch ancestry.

William Force was a member of a well-established business family. He owned the successful shipping firm William H. Force and Co., and his father had been prosperous in the manufacturing industry. In 1889, Force married Katherine Talmage, the granddaughter of former Brooklyn mayor Thomas Talmage. The Forces were part of Brooklyn high society, while William Force was a member of numerous prestigious clubs in the city. He also owned an art collection. Like the Astor family, the Forces were members of the Episcopal Church. Madeleine&#x27;s maternal grandfather was New York State Assemblyman Tunis V. P. Talmage and her great-grandfather, Thomas G. Talmage, was Mayor of Brooklyn. She is also distantly related to Col. Benjamin Tallmadge, who served directly under George Washington in the American War of Independence.

Madeleine was educated at Miss Ely&#x27;s School and then for four years at Miss Spence&#x27;s School, on West 48th Street in Manhattan. According to one report, she was &quot;counted an especially brilliant pupil&quot; at this school. She and her sister were also taken abroad by their mother and toured Europe several times. When she was introduced to New York social life, she was immediately adopted by the Junior League, a clique of debutantes. She appeared in several New York society plays and attracted quite a following. She was known to be a very competent horsewoman and enjoyed yachting. One report said she was bright and good with drawing-room conversation.

==Courtship and first marriage==

She met Colonel John Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Astor IV, the only son of businessman William Backhouse Astor, Jr. and socialite Caroline Webster &quot;Lina&quot; Schermerhorn. During their courtship, he took her on automobile drives and yacht trips, and they were often followed by the press. They became engaged in August 1911 and were married on September 9, 1911. There was a considerable amount of opposition to the marriage, not only because of their age difference (29 years apart, with Madeleine being 18 and John being 47) but also because of his recent divorce (November 1909) from his previous wife. After several Episcopal priests refused to celebrate the nuptials, the couple was eventually married by a Congregationalist minister in Beechwood, his Newport mansion. His son William Vincent Astor served as best man.

After their marriage, they had an extended honeymoon. They visited several places locally first, then in January 1912, they sailed from New York on the &quot;Olympic&quot;, and enjoyed a long Egyptian tour. While returning from this part of their honeymoon, they booked their passage on the &quot;Titanic&quot;.

==Aboard the &quot;Titanic&quot;==
Madeleine Astor, then five months pregnant, boarded the &quot;Titanic&quot; as a first-class passenger in Cherbourg, France, with her husband; her husband&#x27;s valet, Victor Robbins; her maid, Rosalie Bidois; and her nurse, Caroline Endres. They also took Kitty, Colonel Astor&#x27;s pet Airedale, and occupied one of the parlour suites. On the night of April 14, 1912, Colonel Astor reported to his wife that the ship had hit an iceberg. He reassured her that the damage did not appear serious, though he helped her strap on her life jacket. While they were waiting on the boat-deck, Mrs. Astor lent Leah Aks, a third-class passenger, her fur shawl to keep her son, Filly, warm. At one point, the Astors retired to the gymnasium and sat on the mechanical horses in their life jackets. Colonel Astor found another life jacket which he reportedly cut with a pen knife to show Mrs. Astor what it was made of. When it was time to board a lifeboat, Mrs. Astor, her maid, and her nurse had to crawl through the first-class promenade window into the tilting lifeboat 4, which had been lowered down to A deck to take on more passengers. Colonel Astor helped Mrs. Astor climb through the window and asked if he could accompany her as she was &#x27;in a delicate condition&#x27;. The request was denied by Second Officer Charles Lightoller. An account of Madeleine Astor&#x27;s boarding of the lifeboat was given by Archibald Gracie IV to the US Senate Titanic inquiry. Gracie was a fellow passenger and recalled the events regarding Mrs. Astor in the following terms.

The only incident I remember in particular at this point is when Mrs Astor was put in the boat. She was lifted up through the window, and her husband helped her on the other side, and when she got in, her husband was on one side of this window and I was on the other side, at the next window. I heard Mr Astor ask the second officer whether he would not be allowed to go aboard this boat to protect his wife. He said, &#x27;No, sir, no man is allowed on this boat or any of the boats until the ladies are off.&#x27; Mr Astor then said, &#x27;Well, tell me what is the number of this boat so I may find her afterwards,&#x27; or words to that effect. The answer came back, &#x27;No. 4.&#x27;

Colonel Astor and his valet died in the sinking; the former&#x27;s body was recovered on April 22. He was found to be carrying about $2,500 in cash, brought with him from his cabin. His young widow and the other survivors were rescued by the RMS &quot;Carpathia&quot; around 03:30.

Madeleine Astor gave an account of what she recalled almost immediately after her arrival home through her spokesman Nicholas Biddle, who was a trustee of the Astor estate. The account given by her spokesman is:

==Widowhood==
After Astor returned home from her ordeal, she was kept in strict retirement. Her first social function was not until the end of May, when she held a luncheon at her mansion on Fifth Avenue for Arthur Rostron, the captain of the &quot;Carpathia&quot;, and Dr. Frank McGee, the ship&#x27;s surgeon. She held this event with Marian Thayer, also a survivor of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. Both wished to thank these men for their assistance when they were aboard the &quot;Carpathia&quot;.

In his will, John Jacob Astor IV left his wife an outright sum of $100,000, the income from a trust fund of $5 million, and the use of the house on Fifth Avenue. Both of the latter provisions she would lose if she remarried. A fund of $3 million was set aside for his unborn child John Jacob &quot;Jakey&quot; Astor VI, which he would control when he became of age. On August 14, 1912, Astor gave birth to Jakey at her Fifth Avenue mansion. For the next four years, she raised him as part of the Astor family. She did not appear very often in society until the end of 1913, when according to the press, they published her first photograph since the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster.

After this, she appeared more often in public and her activities were frequently reported in the press. In 1915, she remodeled her house on Fifth Avenue and this was made a feature article in the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. Many articles about her eldest son were also published.

==Remarriages==

Four years after Colonel Astor&#x27;s death, Astor married her childhood friend, banker William Karl Dick (May 28, 1888 – September 5, 1953), on June 22, 1916, in Bar Harbor, Maine, and honeymooned in California. He was a vice-president of the Manufacturers Trust Company of New York and a part owner and director of the &quot;Brooklyn Times&quot;. As stated in Colonel Astor&#x27;s will, she lost her stipend from his trust fund. They had two sons:
* William Force Dick (April 11, 1917 – December 4, 1961)
* John Henry Dick (May 12, 1919 – September 18, 1995) ornithologist, photographer, naturalist, conservationist, author, painter, and bird illustrator

They divorced on July 21, 1933, in Reno, Nevada. Four months later, on November 27, 1933, Astor married Italian actor/boxer Enzo Fiermonte in a civil ceremony in New York City. They honeymooned in Palm Beach, Florida, and eventually moved there. They had no children together and divorced on June 11, 1938, in West Palm Beach, Florida.

==Death==
Madeleine died of a heart ailment at her mansion in Palm Beach on March 27, 1940, at the age of 46. She was buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City, in a mausoleum with her mother.

<text>John Sheppard (also &quot;Shepherd&quot;, c. 1515 – December 1558) was an English composer of the Renaissance.

==Biography==
Sheppard was probably born around 1515, judging from his statement in 1554 that he had been composing music for twenty years. Nothing certain is known about his early life. The first sighting of him occurs at Thaxted in June 1541 when he married the recently widowed Jane Ewen or Evan. He was then probably in his mid twenties. It is not known whether he served in a musical position in the church of St John the Baptist, Thaxted. He then served as &quot;informator choristarum&quot; at Magdalen College, Oxford continuously from Michaelmas 1543 to sometime between March and Michaelmas 1548.

Sheppard next appears in a list of the Gentleman of the Chapel Royal who sang at the funeral of King Edward VI in August 1553; he may have joined the chapel directly after his departure from Oxford, but, because of a gap in Chapel Royal records from 1547, this is not certain. He appears to have remained active at the chapel up to the year of his death since he was awarded liveries for both the funeral of Queen Mary and the coronation of Elizabeth I.

In 1554 he supplicated, apparently unsuccessfully, for the degree of Doctor of Music at Oxford University, stating that he had studied music for twenty years and had &quot;composed many songs&quot;. In March 1556 he witnessed the will of a fellow Gentleman of the chapel, Luke Caustell, and on New Year&#x27;s Day 1557 he presented three rolls of songs to Mary Tudor. In July 1558 he and his Chapel Royal colleague Richard Edwards were granted the reversion of a lease of a manor in Kent.

Sheppard died in December 1558 during an influenza epidemic. He made his will on 1 December and was buried at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 21 December.

==Sources==
Sheppard&#x27;s compositions for the Latin liturgy exist exclusively in post-Reformation anthologies. Most are contained in two sets of partbooks: the principal source of his Latin music in five or more parts is the Baldwin partbooks at Christ Church, Oxford (GB-Och Mus. 979-83), copied after 1575, while his four-part pieces are in the so-called Gyffard Partbooks (GB-Lbl Add. 17802-5), a set of four manuscript partbooks, probably copied for Dr Roger Gyffard during the 1570s. Much of the Gyffard music may have been composed during Sheppard&#x27;s Magdalen years (Gyffard had formerly been a fellow of Merton College, Oxford). Relatively few of the pieces in these two sources appear elsewhere. 

Other sources supply few additional pieces beyond extracts from longer compositions. His mass &quot;Cantate&quot; appears exclusively in the Forrest-Heyther partbooks; a &#x27;Kyrie&#x27; for Easter Day (see below) is found in the Hammond Partbooks (GB-Lbl Add. MSS 30480–4) and elsewhere; and a setting for two soloists of the troped lesson &#x27;Laudes Deo&#x27; for the first mass of Christmas Day is in a manuscript at Oxford (GB-Och Mus. 45). The six-part &quot;Gaude virgo Christipara&quot;, the only large-scale votive antiphon by Sheppard to survive in anything more than a fragmentary state, appears in a seventeenth-century set of partbooks that now lacks its sixth, &quot;superius&quot; book (GB-Ob Tenbury 807-11); the missing treble part can be partially completed with the help of other sources, but is still lacking in the fully scored, six-voice sections.

The sources for Sheppard&#x27;s English-texted music are more diverse. Two sources compiled or planned during his lifetime contain a few of his anthems: the Wanley Partbooks (GB-Ob MSS Mus. Sch. e. 420-22) and John Day&#x27;s &quot;Certaine Notes&quot;. Although Day&#x27;s collection was not finally published until 1565, there are reasons to believe that it was planned during the reign of Edward VI. The sources for Sheppard&#x27;s services are all of much later date and often incomplete.

==Works==

===Masses===
Of Sheppard&#x27;s five surviving Mass ordinary cycles, the six-part &quot;Cantate&quot; is a full-length, sumptuous festal setting in the tradition of John Taverner, constructed in units of six-part polyphony alternating with a mosaic of semi-choir sections. The principal unifying device, apart from the head-motive passages at the beginning of each movement, is the eight-note figure F-E-F-G-A-Bb-G-F, which occurs at various points in the tenor.

Of the four-part Mass cycles, &quot;Western Wynde&quot; is based on a pre-existing popular melody, also forming the basis of Mass cycles by Taverner and Christopher Tye. In Sheppard&#x27;s setting the melody migrates between the treble and the tenor. Two other cycles, &quot;Be not afraid&quot; and &quot;The Frences Mass&quot; are both elaborately contrapuntal and freely constructed, with the former scored exclusively for men&#x27;s voices.

&quot;Playnsong Masse for a Mene&quot; (also for four voices) is a much simpler work. Written in a simplified notation known as &#x27;strene,&#x27; which resembles the symbols of plainsong, it utilises a technique occasionally employed to allow those able to read plainsong, but not mensural notation, to sing simple polyphony. This &#x27;plainsong&#x27; style, which was rhythmically uncomplicated and admitted no dissonance more complicated than a cadential suspension (although there is a notable exception in Sheppard&#x27;s &quot;Agnus Dei&quot;), is also to be found in Taverner&#x27;s &quot;Plainsong Mass&quot; – although this now survives only in conventional, mensural notation. Sheppard&#x27;s mass includes a &quot;Kyrie&quot; (unlike most Sarum Mass cycles) and is an &quot;alternatim&quot; setting with alternating sections of chant and polyphony.

===Other Latin music===
On her accession in 1553, Mary Tudor determined to restore England to the Catholic faith after the Protestant years of Edward VI. This entailed restoring the Latin-language services of the Sarum Rite. A new, up-to-date repertoire of music was required for her chapel, and Sheppard was instrumental in supplying it with suitable compositions.

==== Responsories ====
There are 20 responsories, elaborate liturgical units sung in their most expansive form at Vespers on the more important feasts and at Matins. In this form the complete responsory is sung and then followed by, first, a verse and, secondly, a doxology, each of which is followed by (often progressively) shortened repeats of the responsory. Sheppard often set the responsory to five or six-part polyphony with the chant sung as a &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in the tenor (less commonly in the treble or mean), leaving the sections that were sung by soloists (the incipit, verse and doxology) to be chanted.

A good example of Sheppard&#x27;s technique is his six-part setting of &quot;Verbum caro&quot;, the ninth responsory at Matins on Christmas Day. One of the most grandiose of Sheppard&#x27;s responsories is &quot;Gaude, gaude, gaude Maria&quot;; a setting of the responsory and interpolated &#x27;prosa&#x27; for Second Vespers for the Feast of the Purification. In a few settings, for All Saints&#x27; Day, Christmas and Lent, he employs the reverse procedure, providing polyphony for the soloists&#x27; sections of the chant, but leaving the choral section of the responsory to be sung to plainsong (e.g. &quot;In pace in idipsum&quot;).

==== Other liturgical works ====
Like Tallis, Sheppard also composed &#x27;alternatim&#x27; hymns, setting the even-numbered verses in polyphony and leaving the odd-numbered verses to be chanted or, more probably, replaced by (perhaps improvised) organ settings of the chant. Whilst the cantus firmus in Sheppard&#x27;s responds is normally in the tenor, in his hymns it is usually placed in the treble.

Sheppard also composed a number of additional items for particularly solemn feasts of the Church calendar, including settings of the &quot;Kyrie&quot; and Gradual &quot;Haec dies&quot; for Second Vespers (not, in this case, the mass) on Easter Day. Of his &#x27;alternatim&#x27; settings of the processional psalms for the procession to the font after Second Vespers on Easter Day, he completed &quot;Laudate pueri Dominum&quot;, but only part of &quot;In exitu Israel&quot;, leaving its completion to William Mundy and the young William Byrd.

==== &quot;Media vita&quot; ====
Arguably supreme amongst all of Sheppard&#x27;s compositions is his &quot;cantus firmus&quot; setting of the Lenten &quot;Nunc dimittis&quot; antiphon &quot;Media vita in morte sumus&quot;. Here his innovative use of the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in breves allows for an expansive canvas and a leisurely harmonic rhythm that effectively complement his solemn treatment of the text.

The date and circumstances of the work&#x27;s creation remain unclear because the original manuscript is lost. The work might have been written as a memorial for Sheppard&#x27;s first wife, Jane The work survives only in the partbooks copied by John Baldwin in the late 1570s. Baldwin&#x27;s copy now lacks one of the six vocal parts, the tenor, but, since this part bore the plainsong cantus firmus, it can be readily restored from contemporary chant books, except, possibly, in the first two verses where a reconstructed tenor part may or may not be needed (the music sounds complete without it). Recent research has shown that the form of the work as usually performed is incorrect. In particular the chanted Nunc dimittis precedes the antiphon and the scheme of the polyphonic repeats is not as extensive as previously thought. Sheppard&#x27;s bold counterpoint has led some to question whether the surviving text contains copying errors that make the work sound more modern than it should do.

Regardless, Sheppard&#x27;s &quot;Media vita&quot; has remained enduringly popular, with at least nine modern commercial recordings.

===English music===
Sheppard&#x27;s vernacular music has suffered seriously from the loss of manuscript sources. Since he died only a month after Queen Mary, his settings for the Protestant services must have been composed during the reign of Edward VI, who, after some experimental services in 1548, established the first Book of Common Prayer in 1549. Some of Sheppard&#x27;s English-texted music, such as his setting of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and his cycle of metrical psalms by Thomas Sternhold (in GB-Lbl Add. MS 15166) may have been composed for domestic recreation rather than for church use.

As many as ten services (settings of canticles and other items for the new English Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer and Communion services) have been identified, all surviving in varying degrees of incompleteness. The &quot;Second Service&quot; is noteworthy for having influenced the design of Byrd&#x27;s &quot;Great Service&quot;. Stefan Scot has observed that the Creed of the First Service is virtually identical musically to the Creed of Tallis&#x27;s untitled four-part Mass in the Gyffard Partbooks. Sheppard&#x27;s fifteen English anthems, most of which are à 4, comply with the demands of the Protestant reformers for simplicity, clear, audible words and largely syllabic text-underlay.

The part-songs &quot;O happy dames&quot; and &quot;Vain, vain, all our life we spend in vain&quot; (both à 4) are Sheppard&#x27;s only known works to non-sacred texts.

<text>Floyd James &quot;Jim&quot; Thompson (July 8, 1933 – July 16, 2002) was a United States Army colonel. He was one of the longest-held American prisoners of war, spending nearly nine years in captivity in the forests and mountains of South Vietnam, Laos, and North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

==Early life==
Jim Thompson was born July 8, 1933, in Bergenfield, New Jersey, as the son of a bus driver. He graduated from Bergenfield High School in 1951 and he married Alyce DeVries a year later. Thompson worked for the A&amp;P supermarket, before he was drafted by the United States Army on June 14, 1956. He was at first a very truculent, rebellious soldier, but then decided that he liked the military. After basic training at Fort Dix, New Jersey, he decided to make the military his career.

==Military career==
After completing Officer Candidate School (OCS), Thompson served stateside and also spent a year in Korea. He was stationed at Fort Bragg when he was recruited into the Army Special Forces as a Green Beret. After completing Ranger School and United States Army Airborne School, he served as an instructor with the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, from August 1958 to June 1960. His next assignment was as a platoon commander in the 2nd Battalion of the 34th Infantry Regiment, stationed in South Korea from June 1960 to July 1961. Thompson then served as a reenlistment officer with Headquarters XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, from September 1961 to September 1962, and then as a staff officer with 1st Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, from September 1962 to December 1963.

===Vietnam War===
Captain Thompson went to Vietnam in December 1963. Prior to his deployment, he hadn&#x27;t heard of the country. He was to serve only a six-month tour of duty but was captured on March 26, 1964. He was released on March 16, 1973, ten days short of nine years.

====Capture====
On March 26, 1964, Thompson was a passenger on an observation plane (an L-19/O-1 Bird Dog) flown by Captain Richard L. Whitesides when it was downed by enemy small arms fire at , about 20 kilometers from Thompson&#x27;s Special Forces Camp near Quảng Trị, South Vietnam. Thompson survived the crash with burns, a bullet wound across the cheek, and a broken back. Whitesides was killed in the crash. Thompson was quickly captured by the Viet Cong.

Aerial search and ground patrols failed to find any trace of the aircraft. On March 27, 1964, an Army officer visited Thompson&#x27;s home and told his pregnant wife Alyce that he was missing. The trauma sent her into labor and their son was born that evening.

====Prisoner of war====

Thompson spent the next nine years (3,278 days) as a prisoner of war, first at the hands of the Viet Cong in the South Vietnam forests, until he was moved in 1967 to the Hanoi prison system. During his captivity, he was tortured, starved, and isolated from other American POWs. His captors pressured him to sign statements proving that the United States&#x27; involvement in Vietnam was criminal. He refused and was beaten, choked and hanged by his thumbs. They also tied his elbows behind his back and hung him from a rafter until he passed out. At night he was tossed into a tiny wooden cage, where he was handcuffed and shackled in leg irons. At one point, Thompson did not speak to another American for over five years. In January 1973, Thompson was transferred to Hỏa Lò Prison. He was released with the other POWs in mid-March 1973 in Operation Homecoming.

====Return to the United States====
The years following Thompson&#x27;s release were not happy ones. His troubled life was chronicled in an oral biography called &quot;Glory Denied&quot; by Tom Philpott. Although Thompson was promoted to lieutenant colonel upon release and then to full colonel, he had missed the most important years of his military career while in prison. He had no formal military education beyond OCS and lacked even a college degree or experience as a company commander.

He had difficulty adjusting to a vastly changed peacetime Army. In addition, Thompson&#x27;s marriage had been troubled even before his captivity, and his wife Alyce, believing him dead, was living with another man at the time he was repatriated. He and his wife divorced in 1975. Alyce told author Tom Philpott that she believed prison had affected her husband&#x27;s mind. She said he suffered from nightmares and was abusive towards both her and the children. Thompson later remarried but divorced soon afterwards. Thompson never formed any kind of a relationship with his children. His daughters were 6, 5 and 4 when he left, and his son was born the day of his capture. Only his eldest child barely remembered him. He eventually became completely estranged from all of them.
Thompson said that one of the things that helped him cope with his brutal imprisonment was thinking of the fine family that awaited his return. He developed a very serious drinking problem and was in several military hospitals for treatment.

In 1977, Thompson attempted suicide with an overdose of pills and alcohol. His superiors told author Philpott that had it not been for Thompson&#x27;s status as a hero, he would have been dismissed from service because of his alcoholism. In 1981, while still on active duty, Thompson suffered a massive heart attack and a severe stroke. He was in a coma for months and was left seriously disabled. He was paralyzed on one side and could speak only in brief phrases for the rest of his life.

===Retirement===
The stroke that left Thompson&#x27;s left side paralyzed and his age contributed to his forced retirement from active duty in the Army. A ceremony was held for him in The Pentagon on January 28, 1982. Thompson received the Distinguished Service Medal in appreciation for his 25 years of service to his country as an Army officer. Because of his recent stroke, he had a hard time speaking, so Michael Chamowitz, his close friend and lawyer, read his retirement speech.

==Later years and death==
In 1981, Thompson moved to Key West, where he remained active in the community, according to the Monroe County Office of Veterans Affairs. In 1988, Thompson and a number of other former prisoners of war were awarded medals by President Ronald Reagan.

In 1990, Thompson&#x27;s son Jim was convicted of murder and imprisoned for sixteen years.

On July 8, 2002, the staff of Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) East and some of his close friends threw Thompson a birthday party. He was described as being in high spirits and full of excitement. During the celebration, he quoted General Douglas MacArthur: &quot;Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.&quot;

Eight days later, on July 16, 2002, Thompson was found dead in his Key West By the Sea condominium, at the age of 69. His body was cremated, and his ashes scattered at sea off the coast of Florida. There is a memorial marker for him at Andersonville National Cemetery.

In an update to &quot;Glory Denied&quot;, Tom Philpott reported that Alyce Thompson died of cancer in 2009. He also mentioned that Thompson&#x27;s daughter Ruth had suffered three disabling heart attacks and had lost a son to suicide. Philpott reported that Ruth had told him the strength of character that she inherited from both her parents had helped her though the difficult times. &quot;Glory Denied&quot; was later turned into an opera written by Tom Cipullo.

==Military awards==
In October 1974, Thompson started to receive medals and awards in recognition for his service in Vietnam. South Vietnam gave him the country&#x27;s highest award to Allied enlisted military personnel for valor, the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal.

In recognition of his escape from a Viet Cong POW camp for two days in October 1971, Thompson received the Silver Star. For his nine years in captivity, Thompson received the Army Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal, and Legion of Merit. The Bronze Star recognized his continuous resistance to the enemy. The Legion of Merit recognized his suffering for his nine years in captivity.

A ceremony was held on June 24, 1988, in the White House honoring POWs from World War I, World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Two representatives were picked from each war to receive the Prisoner of War Medal. Thompson and Everett Alvarez were chosen to represent POWs from Vietnam.

His military decorations and awards include:
