<text>Darren Kenneth Matthews (born 10 May 1968), better known by the ring name William Regal, is an English retired professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he serves as the Vice-President of Global Talent Development. He is also known for his tenures in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and All Elite Wrestling (AEW), having served as a manager in the latter promotion.

Trained by Marty Jones, Matthews started his career at the age of 15 in 1983. His first matches took place at one of the rare final wrestling carnival booths at Blackpool Pleasure Beach. He went on to wrestle for national promotions on the British wrestling circuit and wrestled on television for ITV. He then progressed to touring around the world until 1993 when he was signed to WCW, where he took the ring name Steven Regal and became a four-time WCW World Television Champion.

In 1998, Matthews joined the WWF (later WWE), where he became a two-time Intercontinental Champion, a five-time Hardcore Champion, a four-time European Champion, a four-time World Tag Team Champion, and the 2008 winner of the King of the Ring tournament. He also had stints as on-screen authority figures such as commissioner, General Manager of Raw, and match co-ordinator for the 2011 season of the original &quot;NXT&quot;. As NXT became WWE&#x27;s developmental brand in 2012, he appeared as the on-screen General Manager; behind the scenes, he began serving as WWE&#x27;s Director of Talent Development and Head of Global Recruiting from 2018 until he was released in 2022. He then signed with AEW and debuted as the founder and manager of the Blackpool Combat Club, leaving the company nine months later to return to WWE as the Vice-President of Global Talent Development.

== Early life ==
Darren Kenneth Matthews was born in Codsall on 10 May 1968. He grew up admiring wrestlers Terry Rudge and Jon Cortez, whom he later called &quot;wrestlers&#x27; wrestlers&quot;.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early years (1983–1992) ===
After training under Marty Jones, Matthews made his debut wrestling for promoter Bobby Barron at his wrestling challenge booth at the Horseshoe Showbar at Blackpool Pleasure Beach at the age of 15. In time, he graduated to be a shooter at the booth, using brutal submission holds to defend prize money against challenges from members of the public. By this time, he wrestled professionally all over Britain for All Star Wrestling where he regularly teamed with Robbie Brookside as The Golden Boys tag team. Both Regal and Brookside appeared in several televised matches during the final years (1987–1988) of ITV&#x27;s coverage of British wrestling.

Matthews went on to tour worldwide, including Germany and South Africa. In 1991, he received a tryout match with the World Wrestling Federation. Matthews relayed that through Lord Alfred Hayes, WWF had become interested in seeing the young wrestler and offered him an opportunity at the WWF UK Rampage Show on 24 April 1991. Wrestling in a dark match, he appeared as Steve Regal and teamed with Dave Taylor and Tony St. Clair to defeat Drew McDonald, Chic Cullen, &amp; Johnny South. Later that year, he received a second booking and wrestled Brian Maxine at the Battle Royal at Albert Hall in London, England on 3 October 1991. Two months later, Matthews was again wrestling on the UK swing of a major American promotion, although this time it was World Championship Wrestling. Appearing as Steve Regal, he wrestled six matches on WCW&#x27;s tour of the United Kingdom and faced Terrance Taylor, Jimmy Garvin, Giant Haystacks, and Oz (Kevin Nash).

During this early period, he was billed as Steve Regal, a name he saw in an American wrestling magazine (in use by &quot;Mr. Electricity&quot; Steve Regal). There were two exceptions to this. One was when he wrestled in Wales during this period, including appearances on S4C&#x27;s Welsh language wrestling TV show &quot;Reslo&quot; under the name Steve Jones and was billed from Cardiff, Wales, teaming with Orig Williams and faced Fit Finlay among others. The other was a brief stint for Joint Promotions in 1986 where he wrestled his first two televised matches under the name Roy Regal. Otherwise, he stuck with the name Steve Regal up until shortly after his arrival in World Championship Wrestling.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1992–1998) ===
==== World Television Champion (1993–1994) ====
In the fall of 1992, Matthews reached out to Bill Watts on a position in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Watts responded favourably to Regal&#x27;s letter and offered him a contract. He began as a fan favourite character, still as Steve Regal. Regal made his televised debut on 30 January 1993 episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and defeated enhancement talent Bob Cook in his in-ring debut on the following week&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Shortly after his debut, Regal entered a tournament for the vacant WCW World Television Championship in which he defeated The Barbarian in the first round before losing to Johnny B. Badd in the quarterfinals.

He became the villain &quot;Lord Steven Regal&quot; on 12 June episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, claiming descent from William the Conqueror and Sir William began serving as his manager. At times arrogantly charming in this persona, one of his memorable statements to a post-match interviewer was: &quot;Do you know what my New Year&#x27;s resolution is going to be? To wake up a half an hour earlier so I can hate you more&quot;. His first major win after the character change was against Marcus Alexander Bagwell on 16 June &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIII&quot;. Regal was scheduled to face Bagwell&#x27;s partner 2 Cold Scorpio on 18 August &quot;Clash of the Champions XXIV&quot;, but he was replaced by Bobby Eaton. Regal himself substituted for the injured Brian Pillman to team with Steve Austin in a WCW World Tag Team Championship defence against Arn Anderson and Paul Roma; Regal and Austin lost that match.

Regal won the World Television Championship by defeating Ricky Steamboat at the inaugural Fall Brawl pay-per-view on 18 September with the help of Sir William. Regal unknowingly broke his neck during this match. Regal enjoyed a lengthy title reign as he retained the title against a flurry of challengers, beginning with his first televised title defence against Arn Anderson on 9 October episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot; which ended in a fifteen-minute time limit draw. He then defended the title against fellow Brit Davey Boy Smith, whom he faced to a fifteen-minute time limit draw at Halloween Havoc. Regal then successfully retained the title against Johnny B. Badd on 10 November &quot;Clash of the Champions XXV&quot; and retained the title against Steamboat at Starrcade and Dustin Rhodes on 27 January 1994 &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVI&quot;, with both matches ending in time limit draws. Regal continued his successful title defences in 1994 by beating Arn Anderson at SuperBrawl IV and fighting a time limit draw against Brian Pillman at Spring Stampede. In the spring of 1994 on &quot;WorldWide&quot;, Regal challenged Ric Flair to a best-of-five series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules in which Regal lost to Flair with 1 win, 2 losses and 2 draws.

The following month, Regal lost a non-title match to Larry Zbyszko at Slamboree, leading to a title match on the 28 May episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, in which he dropped the title to Zbyszko. Regal regained the title from Zbyszko on 23 June &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVII&quot;. Regal began a feud with Sting and was booked to defend the title against Sting at Bash at the Beach. However, Sting was injured prior to the event and was replaced by Johnny B. Badd, whom Regal defeated to retain the title at Bash at the Beach. Regal lost to the wrestling legend Antonio Inoki on 28 August &quot;Clash of the Champions XXVIII&quot;. In September, Regal lost the title to Badd at Fall Brawl.

==== The Blue Bloods (1994–1998) ====

Shortly after losing the television title to Badd, Regal dropped Sir William as his manager (Dundee was fired from WCW due to a contract dispute). Beginning with 26 November episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Regal began scouting fellow aristocrat Jean-Paul Levesque during his matches, which lead to the duo forming a tag team on 21 January 1995 episode of &quot;Pro&quot;, when they defeated Brad and Scott Armstrong. Shortly after, Levesque left WCW and he was replaced by Alabama-born Bobby Eaton when Regal and Eaton faced each other in a match on 18 March episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;. Regal stopped the match and proposed that he and Eaton form a team, which Eaton accepted. Regal formed the team The Blue Bloods with Eaton and was involved in humorous vignettes where he tried to teach Eaton the finer points of dining and the proper usage of the Queen&#x27;s English. The duo first began teaming on 8 April episode of &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;. Regal also toured WCW&#x27;s working partner New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on 16 April, where he unsuccessfully challenged Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Blue Bloods quickly entered the title picture as they initially feuded with The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags), their complete opposites in terms of &quot;sophistication&quot; and presentation. Blue Bloods unsuccessfully challenged Nasty Boys for the WCW World Tag Team Championship at The Great American Bash. On 24 June episode of &quot;WorldWide&quot;, Blue Bloods retaliated by costing Nasty Boys, the tag team titles against Harlem Heat (Booker T and Stevie Ray). Blue Bloods faced Harlem Heat and Nasty Boys for the title in a triangle match at Bash at the Beach, where they failed again. Blue Bloods soon dropped off the title picture and continued to compete as a mid-card tag team. They added &quot;Squire&quot; David Taylor to the team and Jeeves as their lackey by the end of the year. Eaton and Regal received a shot at the WCW World Tag Team Championship against Sting and Lex Luger on 23 January &quot;Clash of the Champions XXXII&quot;, where they failed to win the championship.

On 27 January episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Regal was attacked by the debuting Belfast Bruiser during a match, sparking a feud between the duo as the Belfast Bruiser was a Northern Irishman, who developed an on-screen hatred with Regal due to him being English. In March, Regal faced the Bruiser in a match at Uncensored, but Regal lost the match by disqualification after Eaton and Taylor attacked the Bruiser. On 29 April episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, Regal defeated the Bruiser in a Parking Lot Brawl. The duo were scheduled to team in the Lethal Lottery at Slamboree, but the Bruiser suffered an injury and was replaced by Dave Taylor. Regal and Taylor lost to Jim Duggan and VK Wallstreet. Regal challenged Sting to a match to gain some attention in the company, leading to a match between the two at The Great American Bash, which Regal lost.

On the 31 August episode of &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, Regal captured the World Television Championship for the third time by getting an upset victory over Lex Luger after Luger was attacked by The Outsiders. After winning the title, Regal solely began focusing on his title reign and the Blue Bloods became inactive. He held the title for five months and defended the title against the likes of Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Dean Malenko, former partner Bobby Eaton and Psychosis. Regal was scheduled to defend the title against Rey Misterio, Jr. at SuperBrawl VII, but he dropped the title to Prince Iaukea after a distraction by Misterio on 16 February 1997 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Six days later, Regal avenged his title loss by costing Misterio, the title shot against Iaukea at SuperBrawl VII. Regal got a rematch against Iaukea for the title at Spring Stampede, which he lost. Regal attacked Iaukea on 7 April episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, which resulted in Iaukea losing the title to Último Dragón later that night.

At Slamboree, Regal defeated Ultimo Dragon to win the belt for a fourth time, but lost the title back to Dragon two months later on 22 July episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Regal got another shot at the title against next champion Alex Wright on 15 September episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, but he failed to capture the title. In the fall of 1997, Regal reformed the Blue Bloods with Dave Taylor and they unsuccessfully challenged Steiner Brothers for the WCW World Tag Team Championship at World War 3. Later that night, Regal participated in the World War 3 three-ring battle royal for a future WCW World Heavyweight Championship match.

On the 9 February 1998 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;, Regal was pinned by Bill Goldberg in a match which was Regal&#x27;s final match with WCW, in that run. The bout garnered controversy as it was said that Regal worked more aggressively and stiff than expected. Regal was confronted by Eric Bischoff after the match and stated to Bischoff &quot;I can&#x27;t hit myself&quot; Regal maintains he worked the bout as booked, but he was fired after the bout.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1998−1999) ===
Regal&#x27;s first appearance in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) was on the 29 June 1998 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; in which he defeated Droz via submission with the &quot;Regal Stretch&quot;. After featuring in one more match against Tiger Ali Singh in Pennsylvania, Regal was sent to a training camp run by Dory Funk Jr. in order to get into shape. On his last day, he twisted his ankle in a match against Rhyno and upon returning home aggravated the injury falling in his bathroom, breaking his ankle and leg.

During this time, Regal was suffering from an addiction to Renewtrient, pain medication, and Valium, and was not seen on WWF television until he returned that fall as the &quot;Real Man&#x27;s Man&quot;, a builder/lumberjack-style gimmick created by Vince Russo and based on the image of The Brawny Man. Vignettes for the character showed him doing &quot;manly&quot; things like chopping wood, shaving with a straight razor, and squeezing his own orange juice. After he made his full-time debut in October 1998, he faced X-Pac in the opening round of the tournament for the vacant WWF Championship at Survivor Series, ending in a double countout and thus eliminating both men from the tournament. Regal then began a feud with The Godfather, but he was taken off television soon after before subsequently checking into rehab in January 1999 and was released from the company in April.

=== Return to WCW (1999−2000) ===
After checking out of rehab, Matthews was invited back into the wrestling world, making a somewhat brief return to WCW as &quot;Lord Steven Regal&quot;. His official pay-per-view return took place during Bash at the Beach, where he was one of many participants in the first Hardcore Invitational. The following night on &quot;Nitro&quot;, Regal, accompanied by both Fit Finlay and Dave Taylor, fought Billy Kidman. Despite outside help from Finlay and Taylor, Regal was unable to pick up the win. Two weeks later, he faced Mikey Whipwreck, but Jimmy Hart&#x27;s First Family came out to challenge The Blue Bloods at Road Wild for the Hardcore Trophy, causing Regal to lose the match. Nothing came of this challenge as neither the First Family or the Blue Bloods were featured on the Road Wild card. Similar to his previous run, much of Regal&#x27;s performances took place in tag team bouts. Regal continued his role as a rule breaking villain and had small feuds with teams such as The Filthy Animals. In late February 2000, Regal lost a career vs. career match against Jim Duggan on &quot;Saturday Night&quot; for the World Television Championship, which was done in order to explain Regal&#x27;s release from the company.

=== Return to WWF/WWE (2000–2022) ===
==== European Champion (2000–2001) ====
Regal was once again hired by the WWF and sent to the developmental territory Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW) for a short time. He re-debuted in a match with Chris Benoit at the Third Annual Brian Pillman Memorial Show.

Regal returned on the 18 September 2000 episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot; as a heel, under the name Steven William Regal (later shortened to William Regal). Regal defeated Al Snow to win the European Championship on 16 October episode of &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. After a successful defence against Naked Mideon at No Mercy, Regal would lose the title to Crash Holly at Rebellion on 2 December, before winning it back two days later on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;. Regal would enter his first Royal Rumble match at the eponymous pay-per-view on 21 January 2001, but failed to win. The next night on &quot;Raw Is War&quot;, Regal lost the European Championship to Test. On 8 March episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Regal became the new WWF commissioner, after defeating Al Snow.

Regal later became the on-screen commissioner and self-proclaimed &quot;Goodwill Ambassador&quot; of the WWF and was given a comedy sidekick in Tajiri. During The Invasion storyline, Regal turned face as he remained the WWF Commissioner. During the WCW/ECW Alliance storyline, Regal turned heel once again by costing Kurt Angle the WWF Championship and joining The Alliance. He was fired as commissioner by Linda McMahon, but Shane McMahon, who was the owner of WCW, hired him as the Alliance Commissioner.

After the Alliance was defeated at Survivor Series in November 2001, Regal was forced to become the first member of Vince McMahon&#x27;s &quot;Kiss My Ass&quot; club by kissing McMahon&#x27;s buttocks so he could keep his job.

==== The Un-Americans (2002–2003) ====

Regal defeated Edge to win the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble on 20 January 2002, after using a set of brass knuckles in order to knock out Edge, an action that would later become a trademark of Regal&#x27;s character. Regal defended the title against Edge again at No Way Out in a brass knuckles on a pole match. He lost the title to Rob Van Dam at WrestleMania X8. The same week, he beat Diamond Dallas Page for the European Championship on 21 March episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

Regal was drafted to the Raw brand in the inaugural WWF draft lottery on 25 March, thus bringing the European Championship to &quot;Raw&quot;. Regal lost the European Championship to Spike Dudley on 8 April episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He regained the championship from Dudley on 6 May episode of &quot;Raw&quot; to become a four-time champion. Throughout April, Regal would also hold the WWF Hardcore Championship five times, with all of these reigns coming at non-televised house shows. Regal entered the 2002 King of the Ring tournament, but lost to Booker T in the qualifiers.

Regal later lost the European Championship to Jeff Hardy on 8 July episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, making Regal the antepenultimate champion as the championship was retired later in the year. He joined The Un-Americans, an anti-American alliance consisting of Canadian wrestlers Lance Storm, Christian and Test on 2 September episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At Unforgiven, The Un-Americans lost to Bubba Ray Dudley, Kane and Booker T and Goldust.

On 30 September episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, every member of The Un-Americans lost their matches, causing the group to separate later in the night and break away into separate groups. Regal began teaming with Lance Storm, Christian formed a tag team with Chris Jericho and Test branched off into single competition. On 30 September episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, both Christian and Storm lost matches to Randy Orton, while Regal and Test lost to Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer. This led to all four members attacking each other, thus disbanding the team. Storm and Regal won the World Tag Team Championship from Booker T and Goldust thanks to Regal&#x27;s brass knuckles on 6 January 2003 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. They lost the championship to Dudley Boyz at the Royal Rumble on 19 January, but they regained the championship the next night on &quot;Raw&quot; thanks to an impromptu match set up by Chief Morley after Regal and Storm had put Bubba through a table. At No Way Out on 23 February, Regal and Storm defeated Kane and Rob Van Dam to retain the World Tag Team Championship in what would be his last match for over a year.

In his 2005 autobiography, Regal recalls having swelling all over his body, high heart rate and trouble sleeping in the lead-up to the match at No Way Out. During the match, he suffered a concussion and was briefly knocked unconscious. Over the next few days, Regal&#x27;s health worsened and he consulted a doctor. He was informed that he had contracted a heart parasite from a WWE tour of India in November 2002. This, coupled with his aforementioned concussion, kept him out of action for the rest of the year.

==== Teaming with Eugene (2004–2005) ====
Regal returned after a one-year absence on 5 April 2004 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Upon his return, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff appointed him the guardian of his kayfabe &quot;mentally challenged&quot; nephew Eugene. Regal initially refused, but was demanded to do so in order to be reinstated onto the active roster. Initially annoyed at having to &quot;babysit&quot; Eugene, Regal eventually grew very fond of him and they became friends, becoming a face in the process. On the 10 May episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Bischoff told Regal to sabotage Eugene&#x27;s match so he would quit with embarrassment, in return for Regal being reinstated. Despite reluctantly tripping Eugene, he still managed to defeat his opponent. Regal was eventually reinstated on 21 June episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, before being put in a match with Kane at Bischoff&#x27;s behest, which Regal lost after being knocked out by Kane.

In June, Regal was inserted into a feud with Evolution, after the group&#x27;s leader Triple H tried to convince Eugene that Regal was secretly plotting against him. After weeks of manipulation, Evolution turned on and attacked Eugene on 12 July episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, much to Regal&#x27;s dismay. Triple H would then continue to torment Regal and Eugene, and on 9 August episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal was kidnapped and brutalised by Triple H in order to gain an advantage against Eugene. At SummerSlam, Regal assisted Eugene in his match against Triple H by attacking his manager Ric Flair. However Eugene would still ultimately lose. In September, Regal teamed with Chris Benoit to defeat Evolution members Batista and Ric Flair at Unforgiven. Regal and Eugene won the World Tag Team Championship from La Résistance on 15 November episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. However, at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on 9 January 2005, Eugene injured himself during their tag title defence against Christian and Tyson Tomko. Although they successfully retained the titles, Eugene would be out of action for over six months. This ultimately cost them the World Tag Team Championship as Regal lost the titles back to La Résistance at a 16 January house show in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, with announcer Jonathan Coachman as Eugene&#x27;s replacement. On 7 February episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal teamed with former tag partner Tajiri to reclaim the titles. On the following week&#x27;s &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal and Tajiri faced La Résistance in a rematch for the titles, which they won.

During March and April, Regal and Tajiri defended the titles successfully against the likes of La Résistance multiple times, Maven and Simon Dean, The Hurricane and Rosey and The Heart Throbs. This would lead to a tag team turmoil match involving the aforementioned teams at Backlash on 1 May. Regal and Tajiri were eliminated by La Résistance who, in turn, were eliminated by the Hurricane and Rosey, who became the new champions. In an episode of Raw prior to ECW One Night Stand, Regal questioned Tajiri in backstage about his decision to appear in the event, turning heel in the process.
Regal appeared at ECW One Night Stand as an anti-ECW &quot;crusader&quot; led by Eric Bischoff. At the end of show, Regal and other &quot;crusaders&quot; would engage in a brawl with ECW alumni led by Stone Cold Steve Austin, in which the crusaders were soundly beaten.

==== Various tag teams (2005–2006) ====
On 30 June, Regal was sent to SmackDown! as part of an eleven-person trade during the draft lottery. His first match on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; was on 7 July against Matt Morgan in what was to be Morgan&#x27;s final WWE match. It was interrupted before Regal was even able to enter the ring by Mexicools. His first full match as part of the roster was a loss to Chris Benoit in a catch wrestling match on 16 July episode of &quot;Velocity&quot;. On 4 August, Regal was scheduled to go one on one with Scotty 2 Hotty, but the Mexicools came in and attacked both men. Two weeks later, they teamed up on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; against Psicosis and Super Crazy with Juventud in their corner. Halfway through the match, Regal betrayed Scotty by refusing to tag him and walked out of the ring with a smirk on his face, turning heel as a result and allowing the Mexicools to pick up the win. Two days later, Regal cut a promo telling the crowd that he had returned to his former self, referring to himself as a &quot;scoundrel&quot; and a &quot;rogue&quot;. The promo ended when Scotty ran to the ring and attacked Regal. The following week, a match between the two was cut short when the debuting Paul Burchill interfered to aid his countryman. Regal went on to take Burchill under his wing and tag with him on the hunt for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but the team&#x27;s biggest exposure was a loss in a handicap match against Bobby Lashley at Armageddon.

On 3 February 2006 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Regal and Burchill told the &quot;network representative&quot; Palmer Canon that they no longer wanted to be a tag team so they could go their separate ways. During this discussion, Burchill informed Canon that his family heritage traced back to the pirate Blackbeard and that he wanted to turn this into a pirate gimmick. Burchill, with this heroic persona, started a rivalry with former teammate Regal, who tried to convince Burchill to return to his ruthless ways. Regal lost to Burchill in his first match as a pirate. Regal lost a rematch against Burchill, with the match stipulation that Regal would have to dress like a &quot;buxom wench&quot; if he lost. &quot;Lady Regal&quot;, as SmackDown announcers jokingly referred to him, had to dress up like this until Burchill lost a match. This ended after Burchill abandoned him during a tag team loss to The Gymini.

==== King Booker&#x27;s Court (2006–2007) ====
Regal continued to wrestle in a lower mid-card status, the highlight of which saw him facing the United States Champion John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL) in a losing effort while in England. Soon after Booker T became King Booker after becoming King of the Ring, Regal joined King Booker&#x27;s Court by playing the role of a town crier. As a member of the Court, Regal helped King Booker in his feud against Bobby Lashley, occasionally teaming up with fellow Court member Finlay in tag team matches. However, during this time he also feuded with Finlay for the United States Championship. Regal was knighted by King Booker and was given the title of &quot;Sir&quot;. At No Mercy, Regal lost to a returning Chris Benoit, resulting in him turning his back on the Court afterwards by knocking down King Booker with a punch to the face after King Booker slapped him and called him useless. During the broadcast, Regal was involved in a backstage segment with Vito in which he accidentally exposed his penis.

12 days after No Mercy, Regal stated that while he had once been one of the world&#x27;s greatest wrestlers, he had since become a doormat for other &quot;SmackDown!&quot; wrestlers. He referred to being dressed as a buxom wench for a pirate, the aforementioned locker room incident with Vito, and being knighted by a false king as examples. After announcing he was finished being a whipping boy, he introduced his old tag team partner Dave Taylor and the two went on to easily defeat the team of Scotty 2 Hotty and Funaki. Though the pair reformed their previous tag team, they did not reuse the Blue Bloods gimmick and instead portrayed themselves as sadistic fighters. However, the team was quickly put into jeopardy in their second match together when Taylor suffered a torn meniscus in his left knee, leaving him injured. Taylor took a more relaxed role for a couple of weeks as a corner man for Regal and only wrestled in a few short house show matches. Taylor quickly healed from his injury and the pair feuded with the WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. After defeating London and Kendrick on several occasions, at Armageddon they took part in a four-way ladder match alongside Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury and The Hardys. London and Kendrick coming out on top after Joey Mercury suffered a serious facial injury.

On the 25 May 2007 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Regal and Taylor competed in a number one contenders match for the WWE Tag Team Championship against London and Kendrick, which they lost after Deuce &#x27;n Domino interfered, making both teams the number one contenders. This interference led to a triple threat match the next week on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in which Deuce &#x27;n Domino retained the title.

==== Raw General Manager and King of the Ring (2007–2009) ====

On 17 June, Regal was drafted back to the Raw brand during the supplemental draft, ending his tag team with Dave Taylor. On 2 July, Regal served as Interim general manager of Raw, filling in for Jonathan Coachman. While general manager, Regal introduced the Beat the Clock Sprint to &quot;Raw&quot;, which was used to determine who would challenge John Cena for the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash.

On 6 August episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal became the new general manager after winning a battle royal featuring other participants from the Raw roster. He began incorporating game shows into &quot;Raw&quot; while general manager. On 3 September episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal was attacked by WWE Champion John Cena in retaliation for rewarding Randy Orton with a WWE title shot after Orton had kicked John Cena&#x27;s father in the head the previous week. Regal was missing from &quot;Raw&quot; programming for one month due to this attack, making his return by siding with Vince McMahon. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Triple H was scheduled to face Ric Flair in which Flair&#x27;s win or retire ultimatum was still active. Regal announced that if Triple H lost the match in any way, he would not participate in the Royal Rumble match at the 2008 Royal Rumble. This was to give Triple H a reason to want to win the match rather than avoid ending the career of his best friend and idol. Regal was scheduled to compete against Hornswoggle that night with Mr. McMahon at ringside. McMahon tossed Regal some brass knuckles during the match and encouraged him to use them on Hornswoggle, but he let Hornswoggle go and left the ring. During the Flair versus Triple H match, Triple H was about to pin Flair for the win when Regal suddenly punched Flair in the face with the brass knuckles. This gave Flair the win by disqualification, ensuring that he could continue to wrestle and that Triple H would not be part of the Royal Rumble.

As a result of Regal&#x27;s actions towards Triple H, the following week on &quot;Raw Roulette&quot; he lost a First Blood match to Triple H after several right hands to Regal&#x27;s forehead. A few weeks later, Regal made the Raw Elimination Chamber match for No Way Out. He later faced Randy Orton in a match during the European tour to try to teach him some respect. The following week, Regal won the 2008 King of the Ring tournament on a special three-hour &quot;Raw&quot;, where he defeated Hornswoggle, Finlay and CM Punk all by submission, becoming the first man to make Punk submit. Regal&#x27;s coronation ceremony the next week was interrupted by the returning Mr. Kennedy. A few weeks later, Regal lost a Loser Gets Fired match to Mr. Kennedy, after which Regal was kayfabe forced to leave WWE. In reality, Regal was suspended on 20 May for sixty days for his second violation of the company&#x27;s Substance Abuse and Drug Testing Policy. On 28 July, Regal returned from his suspension as a &quot;free agent&quot; during an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where he was defeated by then-World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk.
Regal began a mini-feud with Jamie Noble after he took an interest in Noble&#x27;s romantic interest Layla, prompting him to attack Regal. Both men picked up victories in consecutive weeks, before Regal won their third match, departing with Layla at his side. Regal&#x27;s feud with Noble escalated the subsequent week when Layla declared that Noble was a loser and that she found a man worthy of her in Regal. However, the feud was short lived.

On 3 November episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal won an over-the-top battle royal to face Santino Marella for the Intercontinental Championship and the next week in Manchester, Regal defeated Marella in a 40-second squash match to win his second Intercontinental Championship. Later, he entered into a feud for the title with number one contender CM Punk. On 5 January 2009 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Regal lost to Punk via disqualification after he grabbed the referee&#x27;s shirt. Due to this, Stephanie McMahon awarded Punk a rematch the following week, with the stipulation that if Regal was disqualified, he would lose the Intercontinental title, but this time Punk was disqualified. McMahon awarded Punk another rematch, this time a no disqualification match on 19 January episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Regal lost the title. Regal got a rematch, but lost the match. Following the draft, Regal was left alone on the Raw brand as his on-screen manager Layla was drafted to the SmackDown brand. At Extreme Rules, Regal unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston for the United States Championship along with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Matt Hardy, Kofi Kingston retained the United States Championship by pinning Regal.

==== The Ruthless Roundtable (2009–2010) ====
Regal was traded to the ECW brand on 29 June. In his first match on &quot;ECW on Syfy&quot; the following night, he teamed with Vladimir Kozlov to defeat Tommy Dreamer and Christian.

After winning a tag match on 6 August episode of Superstars, Regal was named as the number one contender to the ECW Championship. On 18 August episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Regal teamed with Kozlov again to face Ezekiel Jackson and the ECW Champion Christian in which Jackson attacked Christian to ensure Regal&#x27;s victory, with the trio of Regal, Kozlov and Jackson forming a new alliance which was later dubbed the Ruthless Roundtable. At SummerSlam, Regal challenged Christian for his title, but was defeated in eight seconds. With the Roundtable&#x27;s help, Regal defeated Christian in a non-title match on 25 August episode of &quot;ECW&quot; to earn a title rematch against Christian at Breaking Point, but Christian prevailed again with the rest of the Roundtable banned from ringside. Regal was then denied another chance at number one contender-ship, but The Ruthless Roundtable continued to repeatedly attack Christian to continue the feud. As a result, Christian demanded to face Regal, so he received another shot for the ECW Championship on 10 November episode of &quot;ECW&quot; in Sheffield, England, but he was once again unsuccessful.

At Survivor Series, Regal participated in a traditional five-on-five Survivor Series elimination match and was eliminated by MVP. Following Survivor Series, dissension was teased within The Ruthless Roundtable, although Jackson seemed poised to leave the group, Regal ultimately sided with Jackson and turned on Kozlov by assisting Jackson in defeating Kozlov to qualify for an ECW Homecoming battle royal to determine the number one contender to the ECW Championship. Jackson won the ECW Homecoming battle royal and was granted a title shot, but Christian defeated him at the Royal Rumble to retain his title. Despite the loss, Regal and Jackson continued to assault Christian, who accepted Jackson&#x27;s title challenge. On the final episode of &quot;ECW&quot; on 16 February 2010, Regal helped Jackson defeating Christian in an Extreme Rules match to become the final ECW Champion.

==== Later career (2010–2012) ====
After &quot;ECW&quot; was cancelled to be replaced by &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal returned to the Raw brand, but he also became the Pro to Rookie Skip Sheffield on the first season of &quot;NXT&quot;. Regal made his debut on 2 March episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, teaming with Sheffield in a losing effort against Matt Hardy and Justin Gabriel. On 13 April episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal won his first match on the show, defeating former pupil Daniel Bryan. On the 10 May episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Sheffield was eliminated from the competition.

Regal was mostly involved in lower-card feuds after returning to wrestle on &quot;Raw&quot; and also regularly appeared on &quot;NXT&quot; and &quot;Superstars&quot;. In 2010, he regularly lost tag team matches against Santino Marella while trading wins with Goldust. Regal defeated Darren Young in three matches on &quot;Superstars&quot; in October and November.

In March 2011, Regal became the color commentator for the fifth season of &quot;NXT&quot;. On 26 April, Regal was drafted to SmackDown as part of the 2011 WWE supplemental draft. On &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal began a feud with rookie Jacob Novak after Novak taunted him as old and washed up. On the 3 May episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal was set to face Novak, but Novak&#x27;s Pro JTG stepped in to replace Novak. While Regal had the match won, Novak interfered, attacking Regal and causing a disqualification. This attack turned Regal face. On the 10 May episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal defeated Novak by submission to end the feud as Novak was eliminated on the next episode.
After Regal came to the aid of &quot;NXT&quot; host Matt Striker, saving him from an assault by Darren Young, Young challenged Regal to a match on 6 September episode of &quot;NXT&quot; and Regal duly defeated Young. On 13 September episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, Regal teamed with Striker against JTG and Darren Young in a losing effort. On 10 November episode of &quot;Superstars&quot; held in England, Regal was pranked when his old &quot;Real Man&#x27;s Man&quot; theme song was played, then lost to protégé Daniel Bryan, but both wrestlers showed respect after the match. On 15 February 2011 episode of &quot;NXT Redemption&quot;, Regal temporarily took charge as &quot;NXT&quot; host from Matt Striker to set up matches on the show, which led to him being made &quot;NXT&quot; official match coordinator two weeks later. After being appointed as an authority figure, Regal had issues with &quot;NXT&quot;&#x27;s perennial troublemakers, Curt Hawkins and Tyler Reks while Maxine attempted to influence him to get her off &quot;NXT&quot;.

In 2011, Regal also acted as a color commentator for Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) matches and it was during this time he began a feud with Dean Ambrose after an unprovoked attack by Ambrose on Regal, setting up a match between the two on 6 November episode of &quot;FCW&quot;, where Regal viciously attacked Ambrose&#x27;s left arm and pinned Ambrose. Following the loss to Regal, Ambrose became obsessed about wanting a rematch and regularly taunted Regal by using Regal&#x27;s finishing moves to win matches. A rematch was scheduled as the main event for the final episode of &quot;FCW&quot; on 15 July. The match began with Regal viciously attacking Ambrose&#x27;s injured left arm, but Ambrose rammed Regal into the ring post to badly disorientate him. Then Ambrose ruthlessly kneed Regal&#x27;s head into an exposed turnbuckle, causing Regal to bleed from the ear and the match was then ruled a no contest. After the match, Regal stared down Ambrose, then applauded him and turned his head to allow Ambrose to deliver the &quot;Knee Trembler&quot;. Afterwards, the FCW locker room stormed the ring to separate Ambrose from a fallen Regal while commentators questioned whether Regal would ever be able to wrestle again. He continued to work as a color commentator for NXT after FCW was rebranded as NXT.

In 2012, Regal wrestled multiple live event dates wrestling against the likes of Santino Marella and Wade Barrett. Regal ended up on both the winning and losing side. At Over the Limit, Regal participated in a 20-man battle royal, but he was ultimately unsuccessful. In late 2012, Regal played the role of Sheamus&#x27; friend in Sheamus&#x27; rivalry against Big Show, where he was repeatedly attacked by Big Show. Regal was featured on 6 November episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot; in Birmingham, England in which Regal teamed with Sheamus in a loss to Big Show and Wade Barrett and later on 12 November episode of &quot;Raw&quot; he lost to Big Show.

==== Final wrestling matches (2012–2013) ====
Regal wrestled for the WWE during the April tour of the United Kingdom losing to Antonio Cesaro on &quot;Raw&quot; and losing to Wade Barrett on &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On 1 December, Regal defeated Ace Steel in a match for World League Wrestling in Eldon, Missouri. Regal would later make a surprise appearance on 17 June 2013 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; where he challenged Cesaro to a match in which he was defeated.

On 5 December, Regal started a feud with his former disciple Kassius Ohno when he saved Tyson Kidd from an assault by Ohno and Leo Kruger. When Regal later saved Derrick Bateman from Ohno&#x27;s post-match attack, Ohno confronted Regal, who punched Ohno. The next week, Regal apologised to Ohno. In reply, Ohno stated that he had followed in Regal&#x27;s footsteps to arrive in WWE, but that Regal&#x27;s whole career had no legacy, leading to Regal punching Ohno again. After both men continued to attack each other, the rivalry culminated in a match on 10 April 2013 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, which Regal won. Ohno later apologised to Regal. On 26 June episode of &quot;NXT,&quot; Regal tried to help Ohno, Adrian Neville and Corey Graves from a joint assault by The Wyatt Family, Garrett Dylan and Scott Dawson, but was overwhelmed. Two weeks later, Graves, Neville and Regal faced The Wyatt Family with Bray Wyatt pinning Regal.

Regal&#x27;s final in-ring feud was against Antonio Cesaro due to Regal saving Byron Saxton from Cesaro&#x27;s bullying, which culminated with Cesaro defeating Regal on 25 December episode of &quot;NXT&quot;. This would be his final match. In 2017, he confirmed that he had retired from wrestling. However, he wrestled Sami Zayn in a behind-closed-doors match at a WWE try out in Dubai in 2014.

==== Work on NXT (2014–2022) ====
In July 2014, Regal was given the on-screen role of General Manager of NXT. Dave Meltzer later wrote that Regal was &quot;moved from the commentary booth to the figurehead commissioner role, since the decision was made that NXT should be about grooming announcers for the future in WWE, and they simply don&#x27;t think of Regal for that role&quot;. In both late 2014 and early 2015, WWE executive Triple H described Regal as playing a key role in recruiting wrestlers to NXT and WWE as a whole, whether from the wrestling circuit or from other sports. He also became a trainer at the WWE Performance Center after the passing of Dusty Rhodes. As the on-screen General Manager, Regal made regular appearances on NXT television throughout 2015 and 2016. He appeared during the Cruiserweight Classic semi-finals, handing TJ Perkins his medallion for defeating Kota Ibushi. On 22 January 2018, Regal made a brief appearance on stage during the 25th Anniversary episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as a former Raw general manager. In February, WWE.com referred to him as the WWE Director of Talent Development and Head of Global Recruiting. Regal was named also the on-screen General Manager of the cruiserweight brand 205 Live on 13 April 2020. Regal was released from his WWE contract on 5 January 2022, ending his 22-year tenure with the company.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2022) ===

At the AEW event Revolution in March 2022, Regal made his surprise debut after the match between Jon Moxley and Bryan Danielson, two of his former protégés (with Moxley also being a one-time rival) and broke up their brawl before forcing them to shake hands with each other. During the media scrum after the event, Tony Khan confirmed that Regal had officially signed with the company. He began to manage Danielson and Moxley as a tag team and named them the Blackpool Combat Club (BCC), with Wheeler Yuta and Claudio Castagnoli later joining the group. The BCC feuded with the Jericho Appreciation Society over the summer.

At Full Gear in November, Regal helped MJF win the AEW World Championship from Moxley by handing MJF his signature brass knuckles while the referee was incapacitated. On the 23 November episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Regal praised MJF but was interrupted by Moxley, who agreed to Danielson&#x27;s pleas not to attack Regal on the condition that Regal leave and never come back. On the 30 November episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, MJF attacked Regal with his own brass knuckles; following this, it was reported that Regal was set to leave AEW. His final appearance was a pre-taped interview with Tony Schiavone that aired on the 7 December edition of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, in which he told the BCC that he realised they no longer needed him and thus betrayed them to teach them one final lesson: that they should always stay one step ahead. According to Khan, Regal had requested not to renew his contract so that he could return to WWE and work alongside his son, who had made his wrestling debut for WWE while Regal was with AEW. On 30 December, Regal confirmed his departure from AEW on Twitter and spoke highly of his time there.

=== Second return to WWE (2023−present) ===
Regal returned to WWE in January 2023, taking on the behind-the-scenes role of Vice President of Global Talent Development. After Regal left AEW, he had a clause in his contract, so he could not appear on television for an entire year, eventually making his return to WWE television on 23 January 2024 episode of &quot;NXT&quot;, appointing Ava as the new general manager of NXT. He later appeared at &quot;NXT&quot;: Roadblock on 5 March after his son, Charlie Dempsey won the NXT Heritage Cup. On 27 October at NXT Halloween Havoc, Regal appeared and offered to be the cornerman for Lexis King for his upcoming NXT Heritage Cup match against Dempsey. During the match, Regal passed his signature brass knuckles for King to use against Dempsey but King refused, wanting to win the Cup on his own merit and lost the match 0–2 in British Round Rules. On the December 24 episode of &quot;NXT&quot; (taped December 17), King, again with Regal as his cornerman, faced Dempsey in a rematch for the NXT Heritage Cup. Regal again passed the brass knuckles to King but King objected. Regal then punched King, to which the brass knuckles fell into the ring. The referee saw Dempsey with the brass knuckles and assumed that Dempsey used it on King and disqualified Dempsey. In British Round Rules, the Cup change hands if the reigning champion gets disqualified, resulting in King becoming the new NXT Heritage Cup Champion.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==
Regal&#x27;s style is a hybrid mix of brawling and submission grappling, often utilising a combination of stiff forearm and knee strikes, along with multiple suplex variations to ground an opponent before locking in any number of brutal submissions. While often claiming to be a typical &quot;English gentleman&quot; and a goodwill ambassador, he frequently broke the rules at any given opportunity; he would choke his opponent while the referee was distracted, attack opponents who were tangled in the ropes, and punch his opponent in the head with knuckle dusters when the referee wasn&#x27;t looking. The latter became one of his signature finishing moves and was named the &quot;Power of the Punch&quot;. His other signature moves included a running knee lift to a bent-over opponent&#x27;s head called the &quot;Knee Trembler&quot;, a bridging leg hook belly-to-back suplex called the &quot;Regal-Plex&quot;, and an arm-trap cross-legged STF called the &quot;Regal Stretch&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Matthews began dating Christina Beddoes in 1985, when they were both 17 years old, and they were married in November 1986. They have three sons, one of whom, being Bailey, is a professional wrestler currently performing in WWE under the ring name Charlie Dempsey.

Matthews&#x27; accent is a combination of his native Black Country accent, the Lancashire accent he picked up after moving to Blackpool at age 16, and the slight Received Pronunciation accent he adopted as part of his haughty upper-class wrestling character. He has a tattoo of a rose adorned with his wife&#x27;s name on his left arm and a tattoo of the words &quot;made in England&quot; on his left leg. His pets include two dogs, three cats, two snakes, eight lizards, and a tortoise; he once quipped that he owns so many pets because he sees humans as &quot;vile creatures&quot; who disgust him.

On 6 April 1997, just a few hours before Matthews was set to compete at Spring Stampede in Tupelo, Mississippi, he was driving from the gym with Chris Benoit and Benoit&#x27;s wife Nancy Sullivan when a speeding drunk driver rear-ended them at a stop sign. His car flipped over three times, knocking everyone in the car unconscious; after he regained consciousness, he freed the unconscious Benoit and Sullivan from the wreckage. He suffered a severe concussion in the crash and has no memory of anything from the moment of the incident until two days later. He made it to the arena on time and competed in the match, but did not tell anyone what had happened, resulting in him later finding out that people backstage had witnessed him &quot;wandering around and talking to the walls&quot;. While recounting the story in June 2022, he revealed that he had witnessed the drunk driver switching seats with his teenage son after the crash and told the police this information when they arrived at the scene, but he later discovered that the driver did not suffer any consequences due to what Matthews believed was a &quot;good old boys network&quot; in Mississippi.

In 2003, Matthews was misdiagnosed with what was later found to be a heart defect that was causing the right side of his heart to beat out of sequence with the left, allowing large volumes of fluid to build in his body. After undergoing specialist treatment which involved stopping his heart and months of anti-blood clot treatments, he returned to wrestling in April 2004. During his illness and recovery, he gained and then lost 40 lbs of fat.

In his 2005 autobiography, Matthews revealed that he was once arrested during a flight from Japan to the U.S. after getting drunk and urinating on a flight attendant, claiming to be so drunk that his only memory of the incident was waking up in jail in Anchorage, Alaska. In June 2022, he clarified that he was not acting inappropriately and had simply failed to close the toilet door properly, which resulted in him turning around in surprise and urinating on the flight attendant&#x27;s shoe when she opened the door to check on him. He explained that the plane had actually been forced to land due to a fight breaking out between a group of passengers, not because of his behaviour, and that the flight attendant had confirmed his innocence in court.

On 30 August 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Matthews and nine other athletes as those who were found to have been given steroids not in compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness program. He received stanozolol, somatropin, genotropin, and anastrozole between November 2004 and November 2006.

In December 2022, Matthews named Slade as his favourite band and their 1974 track &quot;Far Far Away&quot; as his favourite song.

== Other media ==
Matthews has been featured in the WWE video games &quot;WWF Road to WrestleMania&quot;, &quot;WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth&quot;, &quot;WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006&quot;, &quot;SmackDown! vs. RAW 2007&quot;, &quot;SmackDown! vs. RAW 2008&quot;, &quot;SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009&quot;, &quot;SmackDown! vs. RAW 2010&quot;, &quot;SmackDown! vs. RAW 2011&quot;, &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;. In &quot;2K15&quot; and &quot;2K16&quot;, both his modern and WCW-era Lord Steven Regal personas were available.

Matthews participated in a 2001 episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; alongside other wrestlers, winning two of the first three rounds and eventually finishing third.

Matthews&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Walking a Golden Mile&quot;, was released on 3 May 2005.

Matthews was also featured in &quot;WCW vs. nWo: World Tour&quot; under his Steven Regal name. While not a playable character, his voice and likeness appear in &quot;AEW Fight Forever&quot; during tutorial popups. After joining AEW, he briefly co-hosted a podcast titled &quot;The Gentleman Villain&quot;.

<doc id="690256" wikidata="Q44137" url="?curid=690256" title="Jeff Hardy">
<text>Jeffrey Nero Hardy (born August 31, 1977) is an American professional wrestler and musician. He is signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), where he is one-half of the reigning TNA World Tag Team Champions in his third reign. He also appears on partner promotion WWE on its NXT brand. He is also known for his tenures in WWE and All Elite Wrestling (AEW).

He is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time as well as one of the most daring high flyers and risktakers throughout his career. Together with his brother Matt Hardy, the tag team The Hardy Boyz are widely regarded as one of the major teams that revived tag team wrestling during the Attitude Era and one of the greatest tag teams in professional wrestling history.

Born and raised in Cameron, North Carolina, Hardy started his career as a youth performing in the Trampoline Wrestling Federation, which he started alongside his brother Matt Hardy. Eventually, that would transition into the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) as they became older. As a tag team, the Hardy Boyz worked as enhancement talents for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1994, and were signed to full-time contracts in 1998. They gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued to rise in popularity. After splitting up as a team in 2002, Jeff&#x27;s popularity as a singles wrestler began to grow. However, the brothers still teamed up sporadically in the years afterward, and together they have held twenty-one world tag team championships between WWE, TNA, ROH and other promotions.

Hardy had great success in his singles career, capturing his first of six world championships, the WWE Championship, in 2008, and going on to hold WWE&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship twice and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship three times. Within WWF/WWE, he has also won the Intercontinental Championship five times, the Hardcore Championship three times and the European, Light Heavyweight, and United States Championships once each. Having won the required championships, he is the 18th Triple Crown Champion and 9th Grand Slam Champion in WWE history (one of five men to complete both WWE Grand Slam formats, and one of two to win all original Grand Slam titles). He has headlined numerous pay-per-view events for WWE and TNA, including TNA&#x27;s flagship event, Bound for Glory, on two occasions. Readers of &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; named him &quot;Most Popular Wrestler of the Year&quot; on two occasions.

Outside of professional wrestling, Hardy is involved in motocross, as well as artistic endeavors, particularly music and painting. He is currently a member of the band PeroxWhy?Gen, with whom he tours and has released three studio albums and four extended plays. In 2003, Hardy, along with his brother Matt, co-wrote an autobiographical book of memoirs titled &quot;The Hardy Boyz&quot;. Their book was a New York Times Best Seller.

== Early life ==
Jeff Nero Hardy is the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy, and the younger brother of Matt Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1987, when Jeff Hardy was nine.
 He developed an interest in motocross at age 12 and got his first bike, a Yamaha YZ-80. He had his first race when he was in the ninth grade. Hardy played baseball when he was young, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to stop playing football in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and football, and he chose wrestling. Hardy&#x27;s favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he did for extra credit.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Early career (1993–1998) ===
Hardy, along with his brother Matt and friends, started their own federation, the Trampoline Wrestling Federation (TWF) and mimicked the moves they saw on television. Later on, the TWF went under several names, eventually being integrated into a county fair in North Carolina. The brothers and their friends then began to work for other independent companies. They drove all over the East Coast of the United States, working for companies such as ACW and other small promotions.

Before arriving in the WWF, Jeff and Matt formed their own wrestling promotion, the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (OMEGA) with Thomas Simpson. The promotion was a more successful version of the original TWF and included talent such as both Hardy brothers, Shannon Moore, Gregory Helms, Joey Matthews, and Steve Corino, among others. In OMEGA, each of the brothers portrayed several characters; Hardy portrayed such characters as Willow the Wisp, Iceman, Mean Jimmy Jack Tomkins, and The Masked Mountain. While there, Hardy held the New Frontier Championship (NFC) as a singles competitor and the Tag Team Championship with Matt. The promotion folded in April 1998 when they signed contracts with the WWF.

=== World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment (1994–2003) ===
==== Early years (1994–1998) ====

Hardy cites Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Sting, and Shawn Michaels as his childhood inspirations to wrestle. He started on World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television as a jobber. His first WWF match was against Razor Ramon on May 23, 1994, in Youngstown, Ohio, with Randy Savage mentioning on commentary, &quot;Welcome to the big time&quot;. His ringname that night, Keith Davis, was the name of Razor&#x27;s scheduled jobber, who backed out on short notice. Gary Sabaugh, who had brought Hardy in a group along with Davis, suggested him to agent Tony Garea, who agreed after Hardy claimed he was 18 (he was in fact, only 16). The next day, he wrestled under his real name against The 1–2–3 Kid, and the match aired on the June 25, 1994, episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;. Later on faced against King Kong Bundy and Jim Neidhart, Owen Hart and Triple H. Hardy defeated Razor Ramon by countout on WWF Superstars January 13, 1996 (taped December 19, 1995) when Goldust&#x27;s handler distracted Razor and Razor chased after him. In 1996, he would be teamed with his brother, Matt and occasionally wrestled as a jobber as late as May 1998 (including a match against Rob Van Dam during the ECW &quot;invasion&quot; storyline that had Hardy billed as being from Virginia instead of Cameron, North Carolina)

==== The Hardy Boyz (1998–2002) ====
The Hardy brothers eventually caught the eyes of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). After being signed to a contract in 1998, they were trained by Dory Funk Jr. in his Funkin&#x27; Dojo with other notable wrestlers such as Kurt Angle, Christian, Test, and A-Train. When the team was finally brought up to WWF television, after months of &quot;jobbing&quot; and live events, they then formed the acrobatic tag team called the Hardy Boyz. While feuding with The Brood in mid-1999, they added Michael Hayes as their manager. On July 5, they won their first WWF Tag Team Championship by defeating the Acolytes, but lost it back to them a month later. After the dissolution of the Brood, the Hardys joined forces with Gangrel as The New Brood and feuded with Edge and Christian. This stable did not last long, however, and on October 17 at No Mercy, the Hardy Boyz won the managerial services of Terri Runnels in the finals of the Terri Invitational Tournament in the WWF&#x27;s first ever tag team ladder match against Edge and Christian. They competed in the first ever tag team triple threat ladder match against The Dudley Boyz, and Edge &amp; Christian at WrestleMania 2000 on April 2, 2000, in which Edge &amp; Christian won. During the match, Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb to Bubba Ray Dudley off a 20-foot ladder.
In 2000, the Hardy Boyz found a new manager in their real-life friend Lita. Together, the three became known as &quot;Team Xtreme&quot;. They continued their feud with Edge and Christian throughout 2000, defeating them for the WWF Tag Team Championship on two occasions. At SummerSlam on August 27, the Hardy Boyz competed in perhaps the most physically demanding type of match they had competed in thus far- the first ever Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC match)- in their hometown of Raleigh, for the Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz and Edge &amp; Christian, but were unsuccessful. The second TLC match at WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, in Houston, which is regarded as one of the greatest matches in WWE history they faced off once again against Edge &amp; Christian and the Dudley Boyz but lost to Edge &amp; Christian.

Hardy gained attention for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches, such as doing Swanton Bomb frontflips off of the top steps of 10 and 20 foot high ladders, making a name for himself as one of the most seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Van Dam on two occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led to Matt demanding a match at Vengeance on December 9, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt by pinfall at Vengeance, while Matt&#x27;s foot was on the ropes, Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match on the December 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and lost. After the match, The Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker attacked Matt as well, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble on January 20, 2002, because WWF did not have another storyline for their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;lita 170/171&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Hardys later came back as a team, and there was never any mention of their previous storyline split.

In early April, the Hardy Boyz began a feud with Brock Lesnar after Lesnar gave Matt an F-5 on the steel entrance ramp, which led to an angered Hardy seeking revenge on Lesnar. At Backlash on April 21, Hardy faced-off against Lesnar in Lesnar&#x27;s first televised match. Lesnar dominated Hardy and won the match by knockout. Lesnar and the Hardys continued to feud over the next few weeks, with the Hardys coming out victorious only once by disqualification. At Judgment Day on May 19, Lesnar gained the upper hand on the Hardy Boyz before tagging his partner, Paul Heyman, in to claim the win for the team. In July 2002, Hardy won his third Hardcore Championship by defeating Bradshaw.

==== Singles championship reigns and departure (2002–2003) ====

After years in the tag team division, Hardy took on The Undertaker in a ladder match for the WWE Undisputed Championship on the July 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Hardy came up short in the intense match, but earned The Undertaker&#x27;s respect when he displayed courage by attempting to rise to his feet after the bout and challenge The Undertaker to continue. Hardy competed for singles titles on several occasions and defeated William Regal for the European Championship on the July 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Hardy was defeated a few weeks later by Rob Van Dam on the July 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; in a ladder match to unify the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and the European Championship was retired. Finally, the Hardy Boyz split apart, as Hardy continued to pursue his singles ambitions on Raw and his brother, Matt left Raw for his own singles pursuits signing with Stephanie McMahon&#x27;s SmackDown! brand. On Raw, Hardy would compete in WWE&#x27;s Hardcore division until the title&#x27;s unification with the Intercontinental Championship.

In late 2002, Hardy had been teaming with Rob Van Dam and Bubba Ray Dudley. He along with Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley defeated 3-Minute Warning at Survivor Series on November 17 in a six-man tag team elimination tables match.

In January 2003, Hardy briefly turned into a heel (villain) after he attacked Van Dam and Shawn Michaels. It ended a month later when he saved Stacy Keibler from an attack by then-villain, Christian. In February, he had a brief program with Michaels, which saw the two team up. Then, in storyline, Hardy began dating Trish Stratus after saving her from Steven Richards and Victoria in March. Hardy and Stratus had a brief on-screen relationship that saw the duo talking backstage and teaming together in matches. Hardy competed in his final match (his first departure) against The Rock and lost. Hardy was released from WWE on April 22, 2003. The reasons given for the release were Hardy&#x27;s erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab, deteriorating ring performance, as well as constant tardiness and no-showing events. Hardy also cites &quot;burn out&quot; and the need for time off as reasons for leaving WWE.

=== Independent circuit and Ring of Honor (2003) ===
On May 24, 2003, Hardy made his first wrestling appearance after being released by WWE during a show for the promotion OMEGA. There, he used his old gimmick, &quot;Willow the Wisp&quot;, and challenged Krazy K in a match for the OMEGA Cruiserweight Championship, in which he was defeated.

This same year, he also appeared on Ring of Honor (ROH) at the event &quot;Death Before Dishonour&quot;, once again as &quot;Willow the Wisp&quot;, wearing a mask and a trench coat. As Willow, he participated in a triple-threat match against Joey Matthews and Krazy K, having the victory and during the which he was quickly unmasked and lost his jacket, being left in an attire similar to the one he wore in WWE. Because of this, he was booed before, during, and after the match by the ROH audience, who chanted &quot;We want Matt!&quot; and &quot;You got fired!&quot;.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2006) ===

Hardy debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 23, 2004, at the &quot;Second Anniversary Show&quot;, in a match against A.J. Styles, for the TNA X Division Championship. He also debuted his new entrance theme &quot;Modest&quot;, a song performed by Hardy himself, and a new nickname, &quot;The Charismatic Enigma&quot;. The match ended in a no contest when Kid Kash and Dallas interfered. Hardy returned to TNA on July 21 and was awarded a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy challenged for the title on September 8, losing to NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. In October, he won a tournament, earning a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on November 7 at Victory Road, TNA&#x27;s first monthly pay-per-view. Hardy was defeated by Jarrett once again in a ladder match at Victory Road following interference from Kevin Nash and Scott Hall.

At Turning Point on December 5, Hardy, Styles and Randy Savage defeated Jarrett, Hall and Nash (collectively known as the Kings of Wrestling). Hardy went on to defeat Hall in a singles match, substituting for Héctor Garza at Final Resolution on January 16, 2005.

At Against All Odds on February 13, Hardy lost to Abyss in a &quot;Full Metal Mayhem&quot; match for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy returned the favor by defeating Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Destination X on March 13. On the March 25 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Hardy teamed with Shocker defeating David Young and Lex Lovett. Hardy then went on to feud with Raven, Hardy defeated Raven in a Six sides of steel match at Lockdown on April 24. Hardy was suspended from TNA after no-showing his &quot;Clockwork Orange House of Fun&quot; rematch with Raven at Hard Justice on May 15, allegedly due to travel difficulties. Hardy&#x27;s suspension was lifted on August 5, and he returned at Sacrifice on August 14, attacking Jeff Jarrett.

He wrestled his first TNA match in four months at Unbreakable on September 11, losing to Bobby Roode following interference from Jarrett. Throughout October 2005, Hardy became embroiled in a feud with Abyss, Rhino and Sabu. The four-way feud culminated in a Monster&#x27;s Ball match at Bound for Glory on October 23, which Rhino won after delivering a second rope Rhino Driver to Hardy. In the course of the match, Hardy delivered a Swanton Bomb to Abyss from a height of approximately . Later that night, Hardy competed in a ten-man battle royal for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, which Rhino also won. At Genesis in November, Hardy lost to Monty Brown in another number one contender match.

Hardy was scheduled to wrestle on the pre-show of Turning Point on December 11, but once again no-showed the event, again citing traveling problems. Hardy was suspended as a result and did not appear on TNA television again. In March, April, and May 2006, Hardy appeared on several live events promoted by TNA in conjunction with Dave Hebner and the United Wrestling Federation. Hardy was later released from his TNA contract in June 2006.

=== Return to WWE (2006–2009) ===
==== The Hardy Boyz reunion (2006–2007) ====
On August 4, 2006, WWE announced that Hardy had re-signed with the company. In the following weeks, vignettes aired hyping his return on the August 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the day of his return, Hardy confronted then WWE Champion Edge, before an altercation between the two that ended when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring, preventing Hardy from delivering a Swanton Bomb. After failing to capture the Intercontinental Championship from Johnny Nitro over the next few weeks, including at Unforgiven on September 17, Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. On the November 6 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Nitro, after Nitro hit him with the Intercontinental Championship title belt. One week later, Hardy regained the Intercontinental Championship from Nitro on the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with a crucifix pin. This marked Hardy&#x27;s third reign as Intercontinental Champion.
On the November 21 episode of &quot;ECW&quot;, Hardy teamed with his brother, Matt, for the first time in four years to defeat The Full Blooded Italians. At Survivor Series on November 26, they both were a part of Team D-Generation X, which gained the victory over Team Rated-RKO with a clean sweep. The brothers then received their first opportunity since Hardy&#x27;s return to win a tag team championship at Armageddon on December 17. They competed in a four-team ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but they came up short in their attempt. In the course of the match, however, they inadvertently legitimately injured Joey Mercury&#x27;s face.

With Hardy still feuding with Johnny Nitro and the other members of MNM, he was challenged once again by Nitro at New Year&#x27;s Revolution on January 7, 2007, in a steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship. Hardy once again defeated Nitro. Hardy then teamed with Matt to defeat MNM at both the Royal Rumble on January 28 and No Way Out on February 18. The next night on the February 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship to Umaga. Hardy competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23 on April 1. During the match, Matt threw Edge onto a ladder and encouraged Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish Edge off. Hardy then leaped off the ladder, drove Edge through the ladder with a leg drop, injuring both Edge and himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers.

The night after WrestleMania on the April 2 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardys competed in a 10-team battle royal for the World Tag Team Championship. They won the titles from then WWE Champion John Cena and Shawn Michaels by last eliminating Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. They then began a feud with Cade and Murdoch, with the Hardys retaining the Championship in their first title defense against them at Backlash on April 29 and again at Judgment Day on May 20. The Hardys then defended their titles against The World&#x27;s Greatest Tag Team in a Ladder match at One Night Stand on June 3. However, the next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the Hardys lost the titles to Cade and Murdoch, competing through injuries sustained in their previous night&#x27;s ladder match. The Hardys earned a rematch at on June 24 but were defeated.

==== Intercontinental Champion (2007–2008) ====

In the midst of feuding with Umaga, who defeated Hardy at The Great American Bash on July 22 to retain the Intercontinental Championship, Hardy was abruptly taken off WWE programming. He posted on his own website and in the forums of TheHardyShow.com that it was time off to heal, stemming from a bad fall taken in a match against Mr. Kennedy on the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. He made his return on the August 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Kennedy by disqualification after Umaga interfered. The following week, on the September 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy captured his fourth Intercontinental Championship by defeating Umaga.

This was the start of a push for Hardy, and at Survivor Series on November 18, Hardy and Triple H were the last two men remaining to win the traditional elimination match. Hardy began an on and off tag team with Triple H, which eventually led to a respectful feud between the two. The rivalry continued at Armageddon on December 16, when Hardy defeated Triple H to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble on January 27, 2008. In the weeks leading up to the Royal Rumble, Hardy and Randy Orton engaged in a personal feud, which began when Orton kicked Hardy&#x27;s brother, Matt, in the head in the storyline on the December 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Hardy, in retaliation, performed a Swanton Bomb on Orton from the top of the Raw set on the January 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and seemed to have all the momentum after coming out on top in their encounters. Hardy, however, lost the title match at the Royal Rumble, but was named as one of six men to compete in the Raw Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out on February 17, where he survived to the final two before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Triple H.

During the March 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy appeared on Chris Jericho&#x27;s &quot;Highlight Reel&quot; segment as a special guest, but ended up attacking Jericho. This led to an Intercontinental title match on the following &quot;Raw&quot; where Hardy dropped the title to Jericho. Off-screen, Hardy dropped the title after he was suspended for sixty days, as of March 11, for his second violation of the company&#x27;s Substance Abuse and Drug Testing Policy. Hardy was also removed from the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXIV on March 30 in which he was booked to win after the suspension was announced.

==== World Championship reigns and departure (2008–2009) ====
On the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy was drafted to the SmackDown brand as a part of the 2008 WWE draft. Hardy made his debut for the brand on the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, defeating John Morrison. Hardy participated in the WWE Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven on September 7 and also challenged for the championship at No Mercy on October 5 and Cyber Sunday on October 26, but failed to win each time. He was originally scheduled to be in the WWE Championship match at Survivor Series on November 23, but, in storyline, was found unconscious in his hotel stairwell, allowing the returning Edge to replace him in the match and win the title. At Armageddon on December 14, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H in a triple threat match to capture the WWE Championship, his first world championship.

In January 2009, Hardy&#x27;s next storyline led to his involvement in scripted accidents, including a hit-and-run automobile accident and an accident involving his ring entrance pyrotechnics. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Hardy lost the WWE Championship back to Edge after Hardy&#x27;s brother, Matt, interfered and turned on Hardy, hitting him with a steel chair. The buildup to this feud involved Matt implying that he was responsible for all of Hardy&#x27;s accidents over the past few months, and at WrestleMania 25 on April 5, Matt defeated Hardy in an Extreme Rules match and in a stretcher match on the April 10 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. In a rematch at Backlash on April 26, however, Hardy defeated Matt in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match to end the feud.

On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Hardy won a fatal four-way elimination match to become the number one contender for Edge&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship at Judgment Day on May 17, but lost to Edge after Matt interfered and attacked him. Hardy then defeated Edge in a non-title match on the following &quot;SmackDown&quot; to earn the right to choose the stipulation for their rematch at Extreme Rules on June 7 and chose a ladder match. At Extreme Rules, Hardy won the match to become World Heavyweight Champion for the first time. Immediately after the match, CM Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and defeated Hardy to win the championship. He received his rematch against Punk in a triple threat match also involving Edge on the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, but failed to win. Hardy got another rematch at The Bash on June 28, and won the match via disqualification after Punk kicked the ref in the back while feigning an eye injury with Punk still retaining the title. At Night of Champions on July 26, however, Hardy defeated Punk to win the championship for the second time. He made his first successful title defense five days later on &quot;SmackDown&quot; by defeating John Morrison. After the match, he was attacked by Punk, who invoked his rematch for the following week, where Hardy retained the championship after interference from Matt Hardy, who was the special guest enforcer. Punk again attacked Hardy post-match, resulting in Teddy Long announcing a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between the two for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam on August 23. At SummerSlam, Hardy lost the World Heavyweight Championship back to Punk. On the August 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Hardy lost to Punk in a steel cage rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship with the stipulation &quot;loser leaves WWE&quot;, resulting in Hardy leaving WWE, in storyline. This storyline was put in place to allow Hardy to leave WWE to heal his injuries, including a neck injury. Hardy also had two herniated discs in his lower back and was suffering from restless legs syndrome. Jeff Hardy&#x27;s contract with WWE expired that week thus ending his 3-year stint with the company.

He defeated Alexander once more on the following episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

On the July 19 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hardy, who by popular demand notably brought back his &quot;No More Words&quot; entrance theme song by Endeverafter for the first time since his 2009 departure (all of his appearances since his WrestleMania 33 return before this one were to &quot;Loaded&quot;, which doubles as his tag team entrance with brother Matt), defeated NXT Champion Karrion Kross, becoming the first man in WWE to defeat Kross by pinfall.

During a house show on December 4, Hardy walked out during a tag team match. The following day, he was sent home during WWE&#x27;s live tour. This turned out to be his final WWE appearance as Hardy was released from his contract five days later. Subsequent reports revealed that Hardy was originally going to be placed in a storyline in &quot;NXT 2.0&quot; with MSK as their &quot;Shaman&quot; but that spot was given to Riddle instead.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2022–2024) ===
In an interview with Jared Myers in February 2022, Hardy confirmed that he planned on signing with All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where his brother Matt has worked since 2020, and would wait until after his 90-day WWE non-compete clause expired to do so. Myers confirmed that Hardy said this in an interview with &quot;Post Wrestling&quot;. On the March 9 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy made his AEW debut, saving his brother Matt from an attack by Team AHFO (Andrade El Idolo, Private Party, and The Butcher and The Blade). On the May 4 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy had his first singles match, defeating Bobby Fish to qualify in the Owen Hart Foundation Tournament. On the May 11 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy advanced to the tournament&#x27;s semifinals after defeating Darby Allin. On the May 18 episode of &quot;Dynamite&quot;, Hardy would be eliminated from the tournament after losing to Adam Cole. After winning a tag team match at the Double or Nothing event, in which he teamed with his brother to wrestle against The Young Bucks, it was revealed that Jeff had sustained a &quot;terrible&quot; concussion-like injury, which left him &quot;almost knocked out&quot; according to Matt.

On June 14, AEW announced that Hardy was indefinitely suspended without pay after being arrested for driving under the influence the day prior. Hardy was scheduled to appear at Triplemanía XXX on June 18, where he and Matt were to face Dragon Lee and Dralístico in the main event. After his arrest, the company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide announced that he would not participate in the event and would instead be replaced by a surprise wrestler. At the event, Matt teamed with Johnny Hardy.

On April 12, 2023, Jeff made his return, assisting his brother, Isiah Kassidy, and Hook from an assault by The Firm members Lee Moriarty, Ethan Page, and Big Bill. On May 6, 2023, Hardy and his brother Matt alongside Hook and Isiah Kassidy would take on The Firm consisting of Lee Moriatry, Ethan Page, Big Bill along with Stokely Hathaway. The Firm would be defeated. Hardy was set to make an appearance with his Willow the Wisp persona, but this idea was scrapped by AEW.

On the February 14, 2024 episode of &quot;AEW Rampage&quot;, Hardy was defeated by Sammy Guevara in a no disqualification match. During the match, Hardy suffered a broken nose. This would be Hardy&#x27;s final AEW appearance as on June 14, it was reported that his contract had expired, ending his tenure with the company.

=== Second return to TNA (2024–present) ===
At Against All Odds on June 14, 2024, Hardy made his unannounced return to TNA to assist his brother Matt, Joe Hendry and The Nemeth Brothers (Nic and Ryan Nemeth) to fight off The System (TNA World Champion Moose, Brian Myers and Eddie Edwards) after Matt and Moose&#x27;s TNA World Championship match. At that year&#x27;s Bound for Glory, The Hardys defeated The System and ABC in a Three-way Full Metal Mayhem match to win the TNA World Tag Team Championship for the third time.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==

Hardy&#x27;s professional wrestling style has been described as &quot;high-flying&quot; and &quot;death-defying&quot; with &quot;daredevil stunts&quot;. His signature finishing move is the &quot;Swanton Bomb&quot;. However, by 2018, Hardy used the &quot;Swanton Bomb&quot; less frequently due to his accumulated lower back injuries. Hardy also used the move &quot;450 Splash&quot; in his early career but stopped after injuring his shoulder, instead using the &quot;Swanton Bomb&quot; exclusively. Hardy also uses the &quot;Twist of Fate&quot;, a Facelock cutter or a facelock stunner. During his time as a heel in 2010, the &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; was renamed the &quot;Twist of Hate&quot;. Hardy&#x27;s other signature moves include &quot;Whisper in the Wind&quot; (a rolling senton bomb or a corkscrew moonsault); &quot;Poetry in Motion&quot;; a sitout jawbreaker; and a double leg drop to the midsection of a supine opponent.

Hardy&#x27;s professional wrestling persona reflects his artistic interests. He is known for his face and body paint which he creates himself before his matches. He credits seeing Sting as a child during a show in North Carolina with inspiring him to create new designs with his face paint each match, saying, &quot;Sting was coming out, this was an old NWA [National Wrestling Alliance] show, and I was able to touch his shoulder. And he had his face painted, his neon green tights on, and the blonde hair - and I was like, &#x27;Oh my gosh, I want to do that. I want to make somebody feel like he made me feel right now&#x27;&quot;.

It is difficult to paint on a canvas while traveling for his work as a wrestler, so he uses his facepaint as a creative outlet. He considers himself shy and introverted when not wearing his painted face, saying, &quot;I can get to the building and have this image in my head. And being that I don&#x27;t have a canvas I can just use my face as what I want to try to bring to life... All these artistic thoughts come into mind. Like it shows artistic freedom and also freedom of your soul. It&#x27;s like expression at its best. I think I am more sociable when I&#x27;m all painted up. I think I feel normal, quite normal, a lot more normal than when I&#x27;m all shy and not painted. That&#x27;s Jeff Hardy, the Charismatic Enigma at his best, when he comes out with the face paint. The face painted freak, man, that&#x27;s by far a compliment in my book&quot;.

== Other media ==
Hardy appeared on the February 7, 1999, episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; entitled &quot;That Wrestling Show&quot;, along with Matt, as an uncredited wrestler.

The DVD features footage of the brothers in OMEGA and WWE, and also briefly mentions Hardy&#x27;s first run with TNA. In December 2009, WWE released a DVD about Hardy entitled &quot;Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules&quot;. In 2012 Total Nonstop Action released &quot;Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy Volume 2&quot;, a followup to the 2005 release featuring a 2 disc long documentary following Hardy&#x27;s return to TNA, his heel turn, and the Victory Road 2011 incident, and is accompanied by the matches spoken about.

== Artistic and musical pursuits ==
Hardy has an eclectic set of interests outside of wrestling which includes songwriting, poetry and creating art. He calls his artistic side &quot;The Imag-I-Nation&quot;. He has created three-dimensional artworks such as a statue of an &quot;aluminummy&quot; named &quot;Neroameee&quot; out of tin foil outside of his recording studio (a spray painted trailer), an artificial volcano in his front yard, which he then jumped over on his motocross dirtbike and a large sculpture of his brother Matt&#x27;s hand signal &quot;V1&quot;, which was seen on &quot;The Hardy Show&quot;, an online webshow which featured both the Hardys, Shannon Moore, and many of their friends. He has sold his original paintings online and has donated his artwork to numerous charity auctions. He also designs the art sold on numerous merchandise throughout his career including the album artwork for his musical pursuits.

In 2003, Hardy formed a band, PeroxWhy?Gen, with members of the band Burnside 6 and Moore, who later left.

Peroxwhy?Gen released their second album &quot;Within the Cygnus Rift&quot; on July 27, 2015. Their third album, &quot;Precession of the Equinoxes&quot;, was released in 2017. He performs his music at venues while traveling for his wrestling career, sometimes just hours after a match. His music features rock and pop songs, tend to be autobiographical and Hardy prefers performing his slower songs live.

== Personal life ==

Hardy met his girlfriend Beth Britt in 1999, shortly after the Hardy Boyz won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time. The couple met at a club in Southern Pines, North Carolina. On March 15, 2008, it was reported that Hardy&#x27;s home burned to the ground in a fire. Hardy and his girlfriend Beth were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack was killed in the fire. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 20, 2010. Hardy and Britt got married on March 9, 2011.
The pair&#x27;s second child, a daughter, Nera Quinn Hardy, was born on December 31, 2015. 
Hardy has a tattoo of roots that starts on his head, behind his ear, and finishes at his hand. He also has a few other signature designed tattoos, one of which, a dragon, he hid from his father at a young age. It was also the first tattoo he got in 1998. He later got tattoos of the Chinese symbols for &quot;Peace&quot; and &quot;Health&quot;, as well as tattoos of fire and a wave. On March 14, 2020, Hardy revealed a new tattoo on his back. Hardy regards his tattoos as his &quot;artistic impulses&quot;.

=== Legal issues ===
On September 11, 2009, Hardy was arrested on charges of drug trafficking in controlled prescription pills and possession of anabolic steroids, after a search of his house yielded 262 Vicodin prescription pills, 180 Soma prescription pills, 555 milliliters of anabolic steroids, a residual amount of powder cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. On September 8, 2011, Hardy was sentenced to ten days in jail, 30 months of probation, and a fine of $100,000. Hardy served his jail sentence from October 3 to 14, 2011.

On March 10, 2018, Hardy was arrested and charged in Concord, North Carolina, for driving while impaired. Hardy allegedly hit 105 feet of guardrail before spinning out. Police reported Hardy caused $8,000 of damage to his car, and an additional $5,000 to the guardrail.

On July 14, 2019, Hardy was arrested in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for public intoxication. On October 3 of the same year, Hardy was arrested and charged with driving while impaired in Moore County, North Carolina.

On June 14, 2022, Hardy was arrested by Florida Highway Patrol officers in Volusia County, Florida, on charges of driving with a suspended license, violating restrictions placed on his license which required him to keep an Ignition Interlock Device — a handheld breathalyzer that prevents users from starting their vehicle after drinking alcohol — in his car, and felony DUI. According to Florida highway patrol officers, they observed a white vehicle &quot;swerving&quot; and &quot;running off the road&quot; at approximately 12:30 p.m. eastern time. They stated that once they got Hardy to pull over and they approached, he seemed confused, belligerent, and smelled of alcohol. The arrest report states that Hardy could not complete any portion of the field sobriety tests the officers had him do, and that he blew a blood alcohol level of 0.291, well above Florida&#x27;s legal limit of 0.08. In a press release sent out on June 14, AEW president Tony Khan announced that Hardy was indefinitely suspended without pay, and that he would only be invited back to AEW on the condition he would complete alcohol rehabilitation treatment and &quot;maintain his sobriety&quot;. Hardy submitted a plea of nolo contendere to charges of DUI, driving under a suspended/canceled/revoked license, and driving while his license was restricted. As a result, Hardy was sentenced to the following in February 2023: a 38-day jail sentence (which Hardy had already served), two years of probation, $4,500 in court fees, a 10-year suspension on his driver&#x27;s license, two years with an ignition interlock device, a 90-day vehicle impoundment, a court-mandated school or DUI program, and community service.

<text>Senegal is subdivided into 14 regions (French: &quot;régions&quot;, singular&quot;région&quot;), each of which is administered by a &quot;Conseil Régional&quot; (pl.: &quot;Conseils Régionaux&quot;) elected by population weight at the arrondissement level. 
Senegal is further subdivided into 46 departments, 103 arrondissements (neither of which have administrative function) and by &quot;collectivités locales&quot; (the 14 &quot;regions&quot;, 110 &quot;communes&quot;, and 320 &quot;communautés rurales&quot;) which elect administrative officers. Three of these regions were created on 10 September 2008, when Kaffrine Region was split from Kaolack, Kédougou region was split from Tambacounda, and Sédhiou region was split from Kolda.
To date, all regions take their name from their regional capitals.

<doc id="690261" wikidata="Q3539870" url="?curid=690261" title="Districts of Uganda">
<text>As of 1 July 2020, Uganda is divided into 135 districts plus the capital city of Kampala, which are grouped into four geographic regions.

Since 2005, the Ugandan government has been in the process of dividing districts into smaller units. This decentralization is intended to prevent resources from being distributed primarily to chief towns and leaving the remainder of each district neglected.

Each district is further divided into counties and municipalities, and each county is further divided into sub-counties. The head elected official in a district is the chairperson of the Local Council five (usually written with a Roman numeral V).





==Districts created since 2015==
In September 2015, the Parliament of Uganda created 23 new districts, to be phased in over the next four years.

<text>David Smith (27 November 1962 – 18 May 2002) was an English professional wrestler best known for his appearances in the United States with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring names Davey Boy Smith and The British Bulldog.

Smith won titles within the WWF in three decades, from the 1980s to the 2000s. Though he was never a world champion, Smith nevertheless headlined multiple pay-per-view events in the WWF and WCW, in which he challenged for the WWF and WCW World Heavyweight championships. He defeated Bret Hart for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in the main event of SummerSlam 1992 at London&#x27;s original Wembley Stadium; he also has the distinction of being the inaugural and longest reigning WWF European Champion in a total of 206 days, and to have held the title on the sole occasion where a match for that championship headlined a pay-per-view event, at One Night Only in 1997. Prior to finding singles success, Smith achieved stardom as one half of The British Bulldogs tag team, alongside the Dynamite Kid. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Early life==
Smith was born in Golborne, where he grew up with his father Sid, mother Joyce, brother Terrence, and sisters Joanne and Tracy. Joyce&#x27;s nephew was Tom Billington, also known as the Dynamite Kid, who was Smith&#x27;s frequent tag-team partner. He was born with measles in his eyes, which led to him often being the subject of bullying at his school, but he got laser surgery in his 30s. Smith enjoyed cricket, football and diving as hobbies.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1978–1984) ===
Smith started his training with Ted Betley at 13 after his grandfather and father noticed he needed to be involved in a positive activity. He started competing on ITV&#x27;s &quot;World of Sport&quot; in 1978 when he was only 15, wrestling under the name Young David against 18 year old &quot;Wonderboy&quot; Bernie Wright, uncle of future WCW wrestler Alex Wright. Smith filled a spot in the promotion left by his slightly older cousin the Dynamite Kid, who had recently departed to wrestle in Calgary. Mentored by the Dynamite Kid&#x27;s friend Alan Dennison, in 1979, Smith appeared to have won the British Welterweight championship from Jim Breaks (as the Dynamite Kid had done two years prior) only for the win to be disallowed due to Dennison distracting Breaks. Smith then held Breaks to a 1–1 draw, as a result of which Dennison himself challenged and defeated Breaks for the belt. Smith was then spotted by Bruce Hart, who was scouting talent in the UK, and like the Dynamite Kid before him, he travelled to Canada to wrestle for Stu Hart. Hart and Roy Wood trained Smith further in Hart&#x27;s &quot;Dungeon&quot; and Smith became a key wrestler in Hart&#x27;s Stampede Wrestling.

During his time in Stampede, he began a feud with the Dynamite Kid, and on 9 July 1982, Smith won his first title when he defeated the Dynamite Kid for the Stampede British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championship. In 1983, Smith debuted in New Japan Pro-Wrestling, where he became involved in a three-way feud with Dynamite Kid and The Cobra (George Takano) over the NWA Junior Heavyweight title. On 7 February 1984, a three-way, one-night tournament was held, and Smith lost to the Dynamite Kid via count-out. After the tournament, Smith and Dynamite Kid formed a tag team in both New Japan and in Stampede Wrestling known as The British Bulldogs. In 1984, the Bulldogs made a shocking move by jumping to New Japan&#x27;s rival, All Japan Pro Wrestling just before the start of All Japan&#x27;s annual Tag Team tournament.

Smith made occasional return visits to the UK, appearing on &quot;World Of Sport&quot; in 1982 where he lost to Dave Finlay in an eliminator match for a shot at the British Heavy Middleweight Championship and 1983 where, as a complaining heel he defeated Bernie Wright in a rematch from the 1978 match.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1984–1988) ===

The Bulldogs, along with Smith&#x27;s brothers-in-law Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart were brought in to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after Vince McMahon bought out Stampede Wrestling. At first, the Bulldogs were able to tour both WWF and All Japan, but eventually McMahon gained exclusive rights to the Bulldogs. Managed by Lou Albano, the Bulldogs began a long running feud with Hart and Neidhart, who were now known as The Hart Foundation. The Bulldogs also feuded with the Dream Team (Greg Valentine and Brutus Beefcake), and on 7 April 1986 at WrestleMania 2, with Albano and Ozzy Osbourne in their corner, the Bulldogs defeated the Dream Team for the Tag Team Championship.

The Bulldogs held the titles for nearly nine months, feuding with the Dream Team and Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik, but the Hart Foundation bested the Bulldogs to win the titles on 26 January 1987. After losing the titles, the Bulldogs gained a mascot, an actual bulldog who went by the name Matilda, and feuded with the likes of The Islanders (who in kayfabe dog-napped Matilda), Demolition, and the Rougeau Brothers. At Survivor Series on 26 November, The British Bulldogs and other face teams won a 10-on-10 Survivor Series tag team match. The following Survivor Series on 24 November 1988 produced the same result.

Later in 1988, The Bulldogs left the WWF, in part due to backstage problems, specifically between the Dynamite Kid and the Rougeau Brothers. The Bulldogs had allegedly pulled a number of ribs (pranks) on the Rougeaus. Curt Hennig also pranked the duo, who, assuming that the Bulldogs were behind that prank as well, retaliated: Jacques Rougeau knocked out four of Dynamite Kid&#x27;s teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite brought to tears) in Miami. No disciplinary action was taken against Jacques. Billington shortly afterwards quit the WWF over a dispute with WWF management over the issuance of complimentary plane tickets, over which he resigned from the company, and Smith followed suit.

=== Stampede Wrestling; All Japan Pro Wrestling (1988–1990) ===
After leaving the WWF, the Bulldogs returned to Stampede Wrestling, and also to All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were hopeful that the return of the Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, the decision was made to split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989, Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his head through the windscreen and being thrown 25 feet onto the pavement. He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.

=== Return to World Wrestling Federation (1990–1992) ===
Smith returned to the WWF in 1990, where he was pushed as the same character from the British Bulldogs&#x27; original WWF run, but this time as a singles star under the name &quot;The British Bulldog&quot;, which he had trademarked during his earlier tag team run in the WWF, thus preventing his former partner Dynamite Kid from using the name. Smith returned to the WWF at a live event on 6 October, where he defeated Haku. Smith made his televised in-ring return on 27 October episode of &quot;Superstars&quot;, where he defeated the Brooklyn Brawler.

Over the next two years, Smith was a mid-carder and engaged in a long-running feud with The Warlord, in which he was victorious. He was a fairly popular performer in the United States, but was a huge attraction to fans in the United Kingdom, due in part to the WWF becoming a ratings hit on Sky Sports, as well as the promotion touring the country holding supercards such as UK Rampage. Smith competed in a 20-man battle royal at the Albert Hall on 3 October 1991, which he won by eliminating Typhoon. After entering as the first man in the 1992 Royal Rumble on 19 January, he eliminated Ted DiBiase, Jerry Sags and Haku before being eliminated by the eventual winner Ric Flair.

In 1992, due to Smith&#x27;s newfound popularity in the United Kingdom, the WWF decided to hold its annual SummerSlam pay-per-view in Wembley Stadium in London. The show was main-evented by Smith (led to the ring by the then British, Commonwealth &amp; European Heavyweight Boxing champion Lennox Lewis) and Bret Hart in a match for Hart&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship. On 29 August at SummerSlam, in front of 80,355 of his homeland fans, Smith won the title in a match which is regarded by many wrestling experts as the finest in his career. Smith lost the title to Shawn Michaels on 14 November at &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXXI,&quot; and was later released by the WWF. According to Bret Hart&#x27;s book, the reason for Smith&#x27;s release was that WWF owner Vince McMahon was made aware that Smith and The Ultimate Warrior were receiving illegal shipments of human growth hormone (HGH) from a crooked pharmacist in England. Due to McMahon being investigated for illegally distributing steroids to WWF wrestlers, Smith and Warrior were released.

=== Eastern Championship Wrestling (1992–1993) ===
Shortly after leaving the World Wrestling Federation, Smith debuted in Eastern Championship Wrestling in December 1992, defeating Jimmy Snuka.

=== World Championship Wrestling and All Japan (1993) ===
In January 1993, Smith signed with World Championship Wrestling, debuting at SuperBrawl III on 21 February, defeating &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Irwin. Over the following weeks, he scored a series of wins on &quot;WCW WorldWide&quot;, &quot;WCW Main Event&quot;, and &quot;WCW Saturday Night&quot;, defeating a series of jobbers. In late March, Smith returned to All Japan Pro Wrestling for its Champion Carnival tournament. He scored a total of six points, defeating Danny Kroffat, Doug Furnas, and Johnny Ace but losing to Akira Taue, Kenta Kobashi, Mitsuharu Misawa, The Patriot, Stan Hansen, Steve Williams, Terry Gordy, and Toshiaki Kawada.

Upon returning from Japan, Smith formed an alliance with top protagonist Sting, and engaged in feuds with top antagonists Sid Vicious and Big Van Vader. At Slamboree on 23 May, Smith wrestled World Heavyweight Champion Vader, winning their title match via disqualification, but since titles do not change hands by disqualification, Vader retained the title. The feud continued afterwards, and culminated when Smith seemingly won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Vader on a tour of England in October, though the decision was reversed. In July, Smith was reportedly involved in an altercation with a man at a bar who was making advances towards his wife. As a result of the ensuing legal issues that followed, WCW released Smith from his contract in December. His final pay-per-view appearance for WCW during this period came at Battlebowl on 20 November, the month prior, where he was teamed with Kole in the first round of the Lethal Lottery; they lost to Road Warrior Hawk and Rip Rogers.

=== Return to England (1994) ===
In January 1994, Smith returned home to the United Kingdom and wrestled for Ring Wrestling Stars (formerly Joint Promotions). He was brought into the company by Max Crabtree to be his next top star after Big Daddy retired in December 1993 after suffering a stroke. During his time in RWS, Smith wrestled the likes of Jimmy Ocean, Ricky Knight, Drew McDonald, Karl Krammer, Kamikazi, Black Bart, Johnny Angel, Dale Preston, and Iron Duke Lynch, while primarily teaming with Tony Stewart.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1994–1997) ===
====Allied Powers (1994–1995)====
Smith returned to the WWF at SummerSlam on August 29, 1994, where he immediately became involved in an ongoing family feud between Bret Hart and his brother, Owen Hart. Smith then teamed up with Bret against Owen and Jim Neidhart in a series of tag team matches, most notably in a victory on Monday Night Raw. On November 23, Smith appeared at Survivor Series in a 10-man elimination match; his partners were Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, and The Headshrinkers. They faced WWF Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels and Diesel, Owen Hart, Jeff Jarrett, and Jim Neidhart, but Smith was eventually counted out. Smith again played a key part in the match at Survivor Series featuring his brothers-in-law Bret and Owen Hart, in which he supported Bret against Owen&#x27;s benefactor; Bob Backlund. Smith would be knocked unconscious by Owen, allowing Owen to take advantage of his brother&#x27;s situation. Owen manipulated Bret&#x27;s mother to surrender to Backlund on Bret&#x27;s behalf, thus costing Bret to lose the match and the WWF Championship.

After entering the Royal Rumble as the second entrant on January 22, 1995, Smith and Shawn Michaels (who was the first entrant) were the final two remaining participants at the end. Smith tossed Michaels over the ropes and celebrated on the second turnbuckle. However, only one of Michaels feet hit the floor and he was able to re-enter the ring and eliminate Smith from behind. Soon after, Smith began teaming with Lex Luger as the Allied Powers. On 2 April at WrestleMania XI, they defeated The Blu Brothers. At In Your House 2 on 23 July, they failed to win the Tag Team Championship from Owen Hart and Yokozuna. Afterwards, the team briefly began feuding with Men on a Mission. On an August episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, the Allied Powers were supposed to face Men on a Mission but Luger (kayfabe) no-showed the match; Smith found a replacement in the WWF Champion Diesel. During the match, Smith unexpectedly attacked Diesel and turned heel for the first time in his WWF career, helping Men on a Mission beat up Diesel and aligning himself with Jim Cornette&#x27;s stable with Owen Hart and Yokozuna, who had been his adversaries just a month earlier, thus disbanding the Allied Powers.

==== Camp Cornette, teaming with Owen Hart (1995–1997) ====

On 22 October at In Your House 4 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Smith received a WWF Championship shot against Diesel, winning by disqualification after Bret Hart interfered. At Survivor Series on 19 November, Smith participated in the Wild Card eight-man elimination match, teaming with Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, and Sycho Sid and facing WWF Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon, Dean Douglas, Owen Hart, and Yokozuna, which they won. On 17 December at In Your House 5, Smith was granted a title shot against new WWF Champion Bret Hart, but was unsuccessful in winning. A notable incident from this match was that Hart bled during the match, which was controversial because WWF outlawed bleeding at the time. Smith entered the Royal Rumble on January 21, 1996, where he made it to the final four before being eliminated by Michaels. On 18 February at In Your House 6, he lost to Yokozuna by disqualification after Vader interfered. At WrestleMania XII on 31 March, he teamed with Vader and Owen Hart to defeat Yokozuna, Ahmed Johnson, and Jake Roberts.

In 1996, after Shawn Michaels became WWF Champion, Smith was put in a feud with the new champion. The feud was supposedly based on Smith&#x27;s wife, Diana, accusing Michaels of &quot;hitting on her&quot;, which angered Smith and made him determined to take the title from Michaels. The two were the main-event of the In Your House 8: Beware of Dog pay-per-view on 26 May, and their match ended in a draw, leading to a rematch on 23 June at King of the Ring, where Smith failed to win the title. Afterwards, Smith formed a tag team with his brother-in-law, Owen Hart, and the two soon won the WWF Tag Team Championship from The Smokin&#x27; Gunns. The team defended their titles against teams such as Doug Furnas and Phil LaFon, Vader and Mankind, and The Legion of Doom. In 1997, the WWF created the WWF European Championship, and Smith became the first ever holder of the title, winning a tournament which culminated in him defeating his own tag team partner, Owen Hart, in the finals on 26 February.

==== Hart Foundation (1997) ====

Hart and Smith later joined forces with Bret Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Brian Pillman to form a new form of the Hart Foundation, a heel faction which feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and other American wrestlers. This created an interesting rift between American fans, where the Hart Foundation were vilified, and Canadian fans, who revered the Hart Foundation. Smith and Owen dropped the WWF Tag Team Championship to Austin and Michaels, and lost the final match in a tournament for the vacant WWF Tag Team Championship to Austin and Dude Love. Smith lost the European Championship to Shawn Michaels on 20 September at One Night Only. Smith was booked in the main event to defend the belt against Michaels. However, Michaels convinced Vince McMahon that he should win, as it would create build-up not only for his impending rematch with Bret Hart, but also for a rematch against Smith at the next British pay-per-view. Smith reluctantly agreed, and fans at the event, who gave Smith an ovation, voiced their displeasure by viciously booing Michaels and littering the ring with garbage. On 9 November at Survivor Series in Montreal, Smith was part of Team Canada (alongside Jim Neidhart, Doug Furnas and Philip Lafon), defeating Team USA (Vader, Goldust, Marc Mero and the debuting Steve Blackman). The event became infamous for the &quot;Montreal Screwjob&quot;, in which Vince McMahon manipulated the finish of Bret Hart&#x27;s match and had him lose the WWF Championship to Michaels, despite Hart not submitting when placed in a Sharpshooter. Smith then paid money to leave the WWF for WCW, along with Bret Hart and Neidhart, soon afterward.

=== Return to World Championship Wrestling (1997–1998) ===
Smith rejoined WCW in late 1997, and began a feud with Steve McMichael, who was complaining about all the wrestlers coming from &quot;Up North&quot;. Smith and Neidhart later formed a tag team, but were only featured sparingly on &quot;WCW Thunder&quot;. They challenged for the World Tag Team Championship on several occasions, but failed to win the titles. He suffered a knee injury in April 1998 that sidelined him for a month. He suffered another, much more serious injury on 14 September 1998 at Fall Brawl during his match with Neidhart against The Dancing Fools, Disco Inferno and Alex Wright. During the match, while taking bumps, Smith twice landed awkwardly on a trapdoor that had been set up underneath the ring canvas to enable The Warrior to make a dramatic entrance in the night&#x27;s main event. The result was a spinal infection that nearly paralysed Smith, hospitalising him for six months. However, while recuperating, Smith&#x27;s WCW contract was terminated due to his inability to perform.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1999–2000) ===
Smith returned to the WWF in September 1999. In keeping with the company&#x27;s new &quot;Attitude Era&quot;, Smith began wrestling in jeans instead of his usual Union Flag-adorned tights and his theme music was to a remix of his previous theme &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; and later to rock music (with the sounds of a dog barking as the song began). On 9 September episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Albany, New York, Smith defeated the Big Boss Man for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Smith forfeited the title later that evening, giving the belt back to Al Snow, because Boss Man had previously (kayfabe) dog-napped Snow&#x27;s dog Pepper to win the title from him, and driving him insane in the process. Smith then began pursuing the WWF Championship, eventually turning heel and beginning a feud with The Rock. Smith headlined Unforgiven on 26 September as part of a six-man WWF Championship match that was won by Triple H. On 2 October, Smith returned to England as a heel at Rebellion, defeating X-Pac.

Smith defeated D&#x27;Lo Brown for the WWF European Championship on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on 26 October. He lost the title to Val Venis in a triple threat match on 12 December at Armageddon. On 6 May 2000 in London, Smith defeated Crash Holly for the Hardcore Championship. Holly regained the title from Smith in New Haven, Connecticut on 11 May episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;. Smith&#x27;s last televised match with the WWF was on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, when he burst into Eddie Guerrero and Chyna&#x27;s locker room, accusing Guerrero (who was the European Champion at the time) of not treating the belt with the respect it deserved. This led to a European Championship title match on that &quot;Heat&quot;, in which both men were disqualified. After &quot;Heat&quot;, WWF announced that Smith had again left the WWF on 15 May 2000. Smith would take a hiatus from wrestling.

===Late career (2002)===
Before his death on 18 May 2002, Smith had been training with the intent of resuming his career and came out of retirement wrestling in two tag-team matches with his son, Harry Smith the previous weekend in Manitoba, Canada. Smith competed at Top Rope Championship Wrestling on 5 May and 11 May, teaming with Harry Smith in both matches and with Zack Murcury in his second match. He had also considered another return to the WWF.

==Professional wrestling style and persona==
Due to his training in Stu Hart&#x27;s Dungeon, Smith was renowned for both his technical skill along with his power moves, frequently performing multiple gorilla press slam variations and a delayed vertical suplex, where he would often hold the opponent in the air for an extended length of time to emphasize his strength. His finishing manoeuvre was a Running powerslam.

==Personal life==
Some writers have claimed that Smith&#x27;s middle name was actually &quot;Boy&quot;, supposedly as the result of one of his parents mistaking the middle name field on Smith&#x27;s birth certificate for the gender field. This story is undoubtedly apocryphal - not only was &quot;Davey Boy&quot; a common nickname in England during Smith&#x27;s youth for boys named David, but British birth certificates are completed by a registrar for the General Register Office, not the child&#x27;s parents.

Smith married his wife Diana at the Hart house in October 1984. They had two children, Harry (born 2 August 1985 in Calgary) and Georgia (born 26 September 1987, also in Calgary). In early January 2000, Smith and Diana divorced, with Diana ultimately gaining custody of their son. Shortly after his release from the WWF in 2000, Smith entered an Atlanta drug rehabilitation clinic to treat his addiction to prescription opiate painkillers, including morphine, upon which he had become dependent following a 1998 back injury suffered while in WCW. 2000 would also see Smith arrested for allegedly threatening to kill Diana and her sister Ellie. This would not be Smith&#x27;s last interaction with the law: following an altercation at &quot;The Back Alley,&quot; a Calgary bar, Smith was charged with aggravated assault against 19-year-old wrestler Kody Light after a dispute regarding how Light had spoken to Diana. The charges were later dropped. Andrea Redding, Smith&#x27;s girlfriend from 2000 to his death, stated that they were planning to get married shortly before his death.

He was a supporter of Manchester United FC.

==Death==
Smith died on 18 May 2002 after suffering a heart attack while on holiday in Invermere, British Columbia, with his girlfriend Andrea Redding, who was Bruce Hart&#x27;s estranged wife. He was 39 years old. Forensic scientist Julie Evans stated that although she had found steroids and painkillers in Smith&#x27;s system, they were not at a life-threatening level. She instead concluded that Smith had died from natural causes associated with an enlarged heart. Bruce Hart claimed &quot;Davey paid the price with steroid cocktails and human-growth hormones&quot;. Two funeral services were held, one by Andrea and the other by the Hart family. Bret Hart attended both.

<doc id="690264" wikidata="Q807101" url="?curid=690264" title="Baptism (Lenny Kravitz album)">
<text>Baptism is the seventh studio album by American rock musician Lenny Kravitz, released on May 17, 2004, by Virgin Records. The album produced five singles and reached number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 74 on the UK Albums Chart.

==Production==
Lenny Kravitz originally intended this album to be a 1970s style funk album, simply titled &quot;The Funk Album&quot;. However, he changed his mind when he picked up an acoustic guitar to write the songs for the album. Having stated that songs started pouring out of him, Kravitz decided that his special project could wait. Instead, Kravitz recorded a more straightforward rock album similar to his 1989 album &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;. The album was recorded at Hotel Edison studios in Miami, Florida, and also features a contribution from rapper Jay-Z on the song &quot;Storm&quot;. &quot;Storm&quot; was originally titled &quot;(I Can&#x27;t Make It) Another Day&quot; and was originally recorded with Michael Jackson. Kravitz had previously played guitar on Jay-Z&#x27;s album &quot;The Blueprint²: The Gift &amp; the Curse&quot;. Kravitz had mentioned in an interview that at the time of the album&#x27;s production, he was in dispute with his record label, who did not agree with his decisions to alter his project, saying that the album featured some darker material representing his stage of depression and other problems he was going through at that time.

==Promotion==
For the promotion of the album, Kravitz kicked off the &quot;Baptism&quot; tour in April of that year across North America. In 2005, Kravitz embarked on yet another tour called The Electric Church Tour: One Night Only in select cities. Kravitz also had a prominent role in the Gap campaign of 2004–2005 as he modelled for the brand and his image was used in stores across North America as a major celebrity seal. Kravitz&#x27;s single &quot;Lady&quot; was used very heavily in the company&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Wear It?&quot; campaign and also filmed two commercials with Gap spokesmodel Sarah Jessica Parker playing the song to and dancing with Parker.

==Reception==
Initial critical response to &quot;Baptism&quot; ranged from average to negative. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 43, based on 10 reviews.

Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; wrote &quot;His highly stylized brand of retro rock has always been a guilty pleasure, even though it&#x27;s been largely hit or miss, but with &quot;Baptism&quot;, Kravitz&#x27;s seventh album, it&#x27;s become sad and limp, like a wet, leftover noodle or a stash gone bad. He should just do a cover album and be done with it&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote &quot;While these are fine individual moments, they wind up being a bit dispiriting since they&#x27;re surrounded by lazy, exhausted retreads where it sounds as if the act of making music is a chore to Kravitz—something that he nearly admits in his lyrics. It&#x27;s a shame and embarrassment, and hopefully it will be a temporary slump like Circus—unless he really does want to quit this business called show, since it would be better for him to stop making records than to crank out depressing sludge like this.&quot;

Ryan Lenz of &quot;Today&quot; added &quot;Some have speculated that Kravitz is intent on cementing a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the fans, &quot;Baptism&quot; seems more intent on giving them something to worship.&quot; Kevin Forest Moreau of ShakingThrough.net wrote &quot;Lenny Kravitz became a star by peddling familiar wares in a flashy package: If there was always an element of &quot;Been there, heard that&quot; in his rock, soul and funk classicism, Kravitz&#x27;s craftsmanship and charisma were usually enough to carry the day. But those elements are critically missing from &quot;Baptism&quot;.&quot; Caroline Bansal of &quot;musicOMH&quot; added &quot;The production is in fact what lets this album down. The mix is all wrong, with the drums far too high and the guitars way too low.&quot;

<text>The United Arab Emirates consists of seven emirates ( &#x27;; singular:&#x27;), which were historically known as the Trucial States. All emirates are founding members of the union, apart from Ras Al Khaima which joined two months after the rest.

<text>The Coming Global Superstorm () is a 1999 book by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber, which warns that global warming might produce sudden and catastrophic climate change.

==Thesis==
First, the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic drift would generate a cordon of warm water around the North Pole, which in turn holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air. Second, if the North Atlantic drift were to shut down, that barrier would fail, releasing a flood of frozen air into the Northern Hemisphere, causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift.

The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream: the melting of the polar ice caps could drastically affect the ocean salinity of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world&#x27;s oceans.

Bell and Strieber contend that such destabilizations have occurred before, and cite seemingly impossible engineering feats by ancient civilizations which must have been catastrophically destroyed since they do not appear in the historical record. Among their examples are the archaeological ruins of Nan Madol, which the book claims were built with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitating a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record, or even in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.

While other explanations besides a global meteorological event are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.

==In popular culture==
Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur. The fictional accounts of &quot;current events&quot; as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background for, and is the source material of, the 2004 science fiction film &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;. Indeed, some events from the book are portrayed in the film with little modification, such as the failure of the Gulf Stream which freezes over large portions of the northern hemisphere including New York City.

<text>Korean [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], also known as K-hip-hop or K-rap, is a subgenre of the South Korean popular music.

It is widely considered to have originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and has since become increasingly popular, both in South Korea and abroad.

While South Korea&#x27;s hip-hop culture includes various elements such as rap, graffiti, DJing, turntablism, and b-boying, rapping makes up a significant part of the culture. The term &quot;hip-hop&quot; is largely recognized and understood as &quot;rap&quot; in Korea.

== Characteristics ==
=== Linguistic hybridization ===
The interplay between the Korean language and English has been used as a technical and aesthetic device in Korean hip-hop. Many Korean hip-hop songs contain syllabic similarities that could be interpreted in either languages. The bilingual aspect of this music is one distinguishing factor between Korean hip-hop and American hip-hop.

As early-stage Korean hip-hop was heavily influenced by African-American hip-hop, Korean hip-hop artists began using AAVE in their lyrics. The dominance of Korean-Americans in the Korean hip-hop scene also contributed to the use of mixed languages in Korean hip-hop. English-speaking Korean diaspora artists such as Drunken Tiger, Epik High&#x27;s Tablo, Swings, Jay Park, and San E have included English lyrics in their raps.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there were debates on the authenticity of lyrics written in English, and some artists deliberately refrained from using English in their lyrics. Garion was widely known for only using the Korean language in their lyrics. The word, Garion, a Korean word referring to a mythical white horse with a black mane, also reflects the group&#x27;s identity. Today, the movement has weakened as Korean rap is now believed to have fully established in terms of linguistic and rhythmic making using the Korean language.

=== Subject matter ===
Although Korean hip-hop adopted American hip-hop music, the difference in culture naturally led to the difference in lyrical content. For example, in the early stages of Korean hip-hop music, many Korean rappers referenced Confucian values and idioms. Bill Stax (formerly known as Vasco), a Korean rapper, explains, “While American hip-hop mainly dealt with themes of women, money, and drugs, there are no drugs in Korea. We need to tell stories that our friends can relate to and enjoy.” Themes that are most often dealt with in Korean hip-hop music are everyday life, personal stories and social issues specific to Korean culture in the case of underground hip-hop, and love in the case of mainstream hip-hop.

=== Musical elements ===
Source:

While differences in sound were deemed small in distinguishing Korean hip-hop music from American hip-hop music, there has been a consistent effort to incorporate Korean traditional sound into hip-hop music. Seo Taiji and Boys, the first Korean musician to adopt hip-hop elements in music, added a short solo playing of the traditional Korean conical oboe (taepyeongso) in their song &quot;Hayeoga&quot; (1993). MC Sniper, an underground rapper and the founder of the hip-hop crew Buddha Baby, is known for his early use of traditional musical and religious elements including the 12-stringed zither (gayageum) and the transverse bamboo flute (daegeum) and the Buddhist wooden percussion (moktak) in his productions. Ones, a first-generation Korean hip-hop musician, is known for his cross-over experiments between hip-hop and Korean traditional music. In April 2016, &quot;Eung Freestyle&quot; produced by DPR crew which mainly used the Korean instrument gayageum attracted global popularity after being released on YouTube.

Korean hiphop music also often shows musical influences from Korean ballads and trot, such as melodies based on Korean traditional pentatonic scales, so-called &quot;gugak scales&quot;, and &quot;bbongki&quot; (), a bounciness closely associated with trot music.

There has been criticism for such a movement. Some musicians noted that Korean hip-hop should not have a unique sound, but follow or use a recognizable global hip-hop sound. For example, Code Kunst, a Korean hip-hop producer, noted that “I do not think Korea needs a unique sound of its own. People who are not Korean can sample ‘Korean’ sounds as well.”

=== Virtual and local scenes ===
Unlike American hip-hop, Korean hip-hop started in the rooms and personal computer spaces of hip-hop fans and then moved to the streets and performance spaces of Hongdae.

==== Web-based communities ====
Early stage Korean hip-hop was closely linked to the web-based communities created on web servers. Servers such as Chollian, HiTel, Daum, Nate, and Naver provided free web-based emails, messaging services, and forums. PC communities created in these servers such as BLEX, Dope Soundz, and Show N Prove (SNP) worked as a place to share Korean translations of English lyrics, swap imported cassette tapes and CDs, and discuss the meaning of hip-hop in their lives. First generation artists such as Verbal Jint, P-Type, Defconn (SNP), and Garion (BLEX) actively participated in these online communities. Web server-based communities diminished when people stopped using web servers in the early 2000s, and the communities moved onto webzines and online sites. These webzines not only published articles but also facilitated communications in the hip-hop scene. Some online sites such as Hiphopplaya (since 2000), Rhythmer (since 2001) &quot;HiphopLE&quot; (since 2010) are still actively used as an online community for hip-hop discussions as of 2019. Many of these online community users started holding a monthly offline meeting called &quot;jeongmo&quot; to discuss hip-hop music and perform their works, leading to the development of local scenes.

In early 2017, the very first Korean hip-hop Awards was presented by two of the largest Korean hip-hop webzines, &quot;HipHopLE&quot; and &quot;Hiphopplaya&quot;. Some of the awards included Rookie of the Year, Producer of the Year, hip-hop Track of the Year, hip-hop Album of the Year, and Artist of the Year. The winners being JUSTHIS, Groovy Room, BeWhy&#x27;s “Forever”, Nucksal&#x27;s &quot;The God of Small Things&quot;, and Jay Park respectively. In addition, the awards included a category showing which artists to look out for, such as Live and Mac Kidd.

==== Hongdae as a local scene ====
Since the mid-1990s, Hongdae became the physical center of the Korean hip-hop scene. Hongdae, a northwestern part of Seoul, is named after a nearby Hongik University in the area. Widely known for its prestigious art/music college and liberal atmosphere, Hongik University contributed to the emergence of youth culture including hip-hop music in the area. From the late 1990s, many clubs began to emerge in Hongdae where various types of music such as rock, techno, and hip-hop were played. Master Plan (MP), originally an indie rock club located in the greater Hongdae area, is often regarded as the birthplace of underground Korean hip-hop. MP worked as a site for consuming, performing, and sharing hip-hop music. Street hip-hop events such as Everyone&#x27;s Mic hosted by Hiphopplaya also took place in Hongdae. Everyone&#x27;s Mic is a weekly open rap competition for underground musicians where participants perform freestyle rap based on the beat played by the DJ. Hongdae not only functioned as a tangible place for production and consumption but also became a symbolic place for underground hip-hop music and imaginary &quot;gohyang&quot; (hometown) for musicians to build their identities.

=== Relations with the media ===
The media has played a huge role in forming the Korean hip-hop scene. The TV program &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; (&quot;SMTM&quot;) gained massive popularity and enabled hip-hop music to be mainstream music in Korea. However, criticism against the authenticity of the TV show resulted in the emergence of independent YouTube channels operated by hip-hop labels and musicians.

==== Hip-hop TV shows ====
Starting in 2012, hip-hop audition programs such as &quot;Show Me the Money&quot;, &quot;Unpretty Rapstar&quot;, and &quot;High School Rapper&quot; became widely popular in Korea. SMTM is an audition program for amateur and professional rappers in which the top 16 rappers divide into 4 teams and compete to be the final winner. &quot;Unpretty Rapstar&quot; is a female counterpart of &quot;SMTM&quot; and &quot;High School Rapper&quot; is a high school version of &quot;SMTM&quot;. As of November 2022, &quot;SMTM&quot; has had eleven seasons. &quot;Unpretty Rapstar&quot; has had 3 seasons since 2015 and &quot;High School Rapper&quot; has had 3 seasons since 2017. These reality competition shows are produced by Mnet, South Korea&#x27;s largest cable music channel operated under CJ Entertainment &amp; Media (CJ E&amp;M), an entertainment and media conglomerate.

These TV shows changed the notion of underground and overground hip-hop music in South Korea. Before the show, musicians who signed with major labels and frequently appeared on TV were considered overground rappers while ones who performed on small stages and worked independently were recognized as underground rappers. However, as hip-hop TV shows made hip-hop music mainstream, even the underground rappers who were critical of overground rappers gained visibility through TV and started working with pop artists. Also, with the success of &quot;SMTM&quot;, underground rappers who negatively thought of signing with labels started considering the idea due to the promise of rising profits in the genre. For example, Deepflow of VMC who criticized overground rappers for commercializing the hip-hop scene, actively participated in several hip-hop TV shows as a producer from 2017. Nafla and Loopy of Mkit Rain who criticized overground rappers for joining &quot;SMTM&quot; eventually joined &quot;SMTM&quot; season 7 as participants as well. Rather than being a stage for only the overground rappers, media and TV shows are now viewed as an opportunity for all types of new rappers to gain visibility and rise to the stardom. This transition has eventually blurred the distinction between underground and overground musicians.

==== Social media and YouTube ====
Social media platforms such as YouTube and SoundCloud has been one of the main channels Korean hip-hop artists present their works and communicate with its fans. Mic Swagger, a YouTube-based freestyle rapping content that invites different hip-hop musicians as guests each episode, became a huge success throughout its four seasons since 2009 and contributed to the popularization of freestyle rap. Also, in response to the criticism against the mainstream hip-hop media like Mnet, hip-hop artists started creating independent channels to express their thoughts and present their music to the public. Label H1ghr Music partnered with Dingo, an online media content creator, to promote new songs independent from the mainstream media. In 2018, rapper Mommy Son released a song named “Mommy Jump” through his YouTube channel after being eliminated from SMTM season 7. The song, which directly condemned Mnet and SMTM, became a massive hit and was nominated the hip-hop song of the year with 38 million YouTube views (as of June 2019).

Rappers and idols also use social media apps as a way of connecting to their fans, creating a sense of friendship with their fans. The use of music streaming apps such as SoundCloud, YouTube, and Spotify can help in exposure for Korean artists, as many of these apps, especially SoundCloud, are used by young kids around the world to discover these artists. Much of the music on these apps provide a similar sound to American rap music, which is popular not only for American teenagers but teenagers abroad as well. There is also room for more experimentation on music platforms such as SoundCloud because artists can upload their work and express their creativity in a way they could not in the Korean idol system and form a deeper connection with their audiences with their work, as well as promote their solo work. 

The emergence of bilingual Korean rappers also helps bridge the gap between Korean and American hip-hop music along with social media. They can communicate with American fans in a way most non-English-speaking Korean rappers cannot. DPR Live explained his newfound presence in the US with his first-ever concert, by saying “I always thought, you know, me being bilingual, just looking at the quality of both music, it&#x27;s both up to par. But Korean music has just as nice flavor and amazing qualities. [It&#x27;s] just the world doesn&#x27;t know yet. And obviously, America is everywhere. Everyone knows. And I&#x27;m just excited to close the gap a little more.” 

=== Overlap with the K-pop industry ===
In its early days, most Korean hip-hop fell into a category called &quot;rap dance&quot;, where artists mixed rapping with pop music. Many K-pop artists incorporated rap into their music, from Seo Taiji and Jinusean in the 1990s to Big Bang and Block B in the 2010s. However, rap in K-pop music was not considered serious hip-hop music and some hip-hop musicians criticized K-pop music for commercializing hip-hop. For example, rapper Olltii criticized K-pop idol rappers in his &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; performance against Bobby for being unskilled and manufactured by large entertainment agencies.

As hip-hop music gained popularity and became part of Korean mainstream music, many idol rappers began to interact with the hip-hop scene. Jay Park, former leader of 2PM, went on to be the founder and CEO of two of the biggest Korean hip-hop labels, AOMG and H1GHR Music. Park has expressed that he doesn&#x27;t consider himself a K-pop artist anymore as he feels distant from the K-pop industry nowadays. Zico, who was active as an underground rapper before officially debuting with Block B, gained the scene&#x27;s respect for his rapping and producing skills and maintained a close relationship with the K-hiphop scene throughout his career. However, there is discourse about whether idol rappers are real rappers. During BTS&#x27; rookie days, the group&#x27;s rap line which consists of RM, Suga, and j-hope, received criticism from hip-hop artist B Free for &quot;quitting&quot; being rappers and continued saying idol rappers are not real rappers. iKon&#x27;s Bobby won the third season of Show Me the Money. Song Mino of Winner was active as an underground rapper alongside Zico from Block B and was the runner-up of the fourth season of SMTM. Ravi of Vixx founded the hiphop label GROOVL1N, which is home to prominent rappers such as Nafla and JUSTHIS. BTS&#x27; RM collaborated and performed with rappers such as Zico and Changmo before joining the group, and has since then collaborated with several artists from the scene.

In addition, Korean hip-hop artists started collaborating with K-pop artists. Successful collaborations include &quot;Some,&quot; a 2014 song by Soyou of girl group Sistar, R&amp;B singer Junggigo, and rapper Lil Boi, that was Billboard&#x27;s K-pop Hot 100&#x27;s longest running #1 hit of 2014; &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sweetness,&quot; a 2014 collaboration of After School&#x27;s Raina and rapper San E, that topped ten Korean music charts shortly after its debut and went on to win several major year-end awards; and &quot;I,&quot; a 2015 song by Girls&#x27; Generation&#x27;s Taeyeon featuring rapper Verbal Jint, that topped eight Korean music charts after its release.

== History ==
=== Late 1980s–early 1990s: Origins of Korean hip-hop ===
Korean hip-hop first emerged in South Korea in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hip-hop culture itself was first introduced to South Korea through cultural diffusion from American soldiers stationed at the Yongsan Base during the war. Specifically, the clubs in Itaewon served as a hub for American soldiers, and later in the mid-1980s, opened up to Korean citizens and they shared a space for hip-hop beats and dance on the dance floor. Following the end of authoritarian military rule in Korea, the loosening of state censorship of popular music in the late 1980s and the arrival of 1988 Seoul Olympics brought global musical styles like hip-hop, rap, and rhythm and blues through the Korean diaspora. Rock musician Hong Seo-beom&#x27;s 1989 song about a 19th-century Korean poet, &quot;Kim Sat-gat,&quot; is credited as being the first Korean pop song to contain rapping.

Hyun Jin-young, a rapper who debuted the following year with the album, &quot;New Dance&quot;, is considered to be the first Korean hip-hop artist.

The debut of Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 with the song, &quot;Nan Arayo&quot; (난 알아요, &quot;I Know&quot;) marked a revolution in Korean popular music. The group incorporated American-style hip-hop and R&amp;B into their music, a move that was so influential that they are considered the originators of modern K-pop, and their explosive popularity paved the way for both pop and hip-hop artists in Korea.

Other popular groups who helped spread hip-hop into the Korean mainstream in the early 1990s include Deux and DJ DOC.

=== Late 1990s–2010s: Growing popularity and underground development ===
The Korean hip-hop scene grew considerably in the late 1990s and early 2000s due largely to a growing hip-hop club scene and the influence of the internet. While K-pop groups continued to incorporate rap into their songs, this period also saw the emergence of pure hip-hop groups, notably Drunken Tiger, &quot;the first commercially successful true hip-hop group&quot; in Korea. The group&#x27;s single, &quot;Good Life&quot; topped Korean charts in 2001, although the group was considered controversial due to the explicit nature of their songs. hip-hop duo Jinusean, who were signed to former Seo Taiji and Boys member Yang Hyun-suk&#x27;s new label YG Entertainment, also found mainstream success during this period with their songs &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;A-Yo,&quot; among others.

In 2001, then-underground rapper Verbal Jint released his first mini-album, &quot;Modern Rhymes&quot;, which introduced an innovation to Korean hip-hop: rhyming. Before this, Korean hip-hop lacked rhyming because it was seen as too difficult due to the grammatical structure of the Korean language. Verbal Jint&#x27;s method for creating rhymes was widely adopted by other artists. Rap duo Garion also made an impact on the underground Korean hip-hop community with their 2004 self-titled debut album, notable for being entirely in Korean.

More Korean hip-hop artists experienced mainstream popularity and success in the 2000s and 2010s. Dynamic Duo&#x27;s 2004 album, &quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; sold over half a million copies, making it the best-selling Korean hip-hop album ever at the time. Epik High topped music charts in both Korea and Japan in the mid-2000s and reached the #1 spot on the Billboard World Albums Chart with their 2014 album, &quot;Shoebox.&quot; Rap duo Leessang&#x27;s album, &quot;Asura Balbalta&quot;, topped Korean charts just one hour after it was released in 2011, with every song from the album simultaneously charting in the top ten on several real-time music charts.

=== 2010s–present: Mainstream popularity with &quot;Show Me the Money&quot; and growth of independent labels ===
Korean hip-hop&#x27;s profile was again heightened in 2012 with the debut of the TV reality series, &quot;Show Me the Money&quot;. The show, which features both underground and mainstream rappers, is credited with increasing the popularity of hip-hop in South Korea. Viewer ratings for &quot;SMTM&quot; seasons 4,5 and 6 continued to exceed 2%, which is exceptionally high for a cable TV channel program. During August 2015, July 2016, August 2017 and October 2018 when &quot;SMTM&quot; was aired, hip-hop was the most popular genre in Mnet Top 100 Korean music chart. &quot;SMTM&quot; worked as a publicity opportunity for previously unknown rappers such as C Jamm, Black Nut, Bewhy and Woo Won-jae. In SMTM 11, Rapper Lee Young-ji became the first female rapper to win the competition.

In August 2013, the Korean hip-hop scene became a ground for fierce diss battles. Influenced by Big Sean&#x27;s hip-hop track “Control”, in which Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s verse called out a handful of the new rappers in the U.S. music industry, Korean artists started sending disses in every direction with harsh lyrics. The “control diss war” began when Swings, the founder and member of Just Music, called out many other rappers by releasing his version of “Control” titled “King Swings” and “Hwang Jung-min (King Swings Part 2)&quot;. The flame flew in every direction and many rappers started dissing each other. One of the main events was when E-Sens, formerly of the hip-hop duo Supreme Team, released his single, “You Can&#x27;t Control Me” to blatantly lash out at his former management company Amoeba Culture and former label mate Gaeko of Dynamic Duo. One day later, Gaeko responded to the rapper&#x27;s challenge by releasing his track titled &quot;I Can Control You&quot;. Eventually, more than 20 rappers including Simon Dominic, Ugly Duck, and Deep Flow participated in the “control diss war” before it ended within one week.

In 2015, &quot;Unpretty Rapstar&quot; aired as a spin-off of &quot;Show Me the Money&quot;. This music competition focused on female rappers including Season 1 runner-up Jessi, who the following year starred in KBS 2TV&#x27;s &quot;Sister&#x27;s Slam Dunk&quot;. It also featured Tymee who is known to be the fastest female rapper in Korea. In 2017, &quot;High School Rapper&quot; launched its first season and became a huge success, bringing many young amateur rappers to stardom. Many of the successful participants in &quot;High School Rapper&quot; signed with major hip-hop labels exemplified by Haon of h1gher Music, Ash Island of Ambition Musik and Young B of Indigo Music. &quot;Unpretty Rapstar&quot; and &quot;High School Rapper&quot; enabled hip-hop music to become one of the most popular music genres in Korea, especially among the younger generation.

In 2016, the Korea Foundation cited Korean hip-hop as a new trend in the Korean wave, the term commonly used to refer to the recent spread of Korean pop culture throughout the world.

Starting in 2016, major hip-hop labels in South Korea started creating their sub-labels, mostly to nurture young hip-hop musicians also referred to as the fourth generation rappers. Illionaire Records established Ambition Musik in 2016 by signing 3 artists who gained popularity through &quot;SMTM&quot; (Hash Swan, Keemhyoeun, ZENE THE ZILLA). Just Music followed up with its new label Indigo music, mostly bringing in teenage rappers who performed in &quot;High School Rapper&quot; season 1 including Osshun Gum, Young B, and Noel. Jay Park of AOMG founded H1GHR Music in joint with Seattle-based producer Cha Cha Malone and signed with young musicians such as Sik-K, Groovy Room and Haon. As these hip-hop labels and sub-labels were getting bigger, they were continuously making their voices louder against the large K-pop agencies that have been dominating the Korean music industry since the 2000s.

== Foreign relations ==
=== Localization ===
Korean hip-hop started from and was highly influenced by American hip-hop, yet evolved to have local characteristics as it adapted to the cultural context of Korean society. Since the 1990s, American hip-hop was brought into and spread through South Korea in several channels: tangible forms of music like cassette tapes and CDs from America to South Korea, individual bodies to/from America and within South Korea, and virtual communities of hip-hop listeners. Korean Americans especially played a significant role in localizing American hip-hop with their English-speaking ability and access to American culture. Tiger JK of Drunken Tiger and his wife Yoon Mi-rae, then a member of a Korean-American hip-hop/R&amp;B group called Uptown, formed the Movement Crew, the influential hip-hop community that gave rise to groups like Dynamic Duo, Leessang, and Epik High, who collectively planted the localized hip-hop firmly in the mainstream pop music in South Korea. In Korea today, American hip-hop and Korean hip-hop exist as separate categories in almost every music chart and sales: &quot;oeguk hipap&quot; meaning foreign hip-hop and &quot;gungnae hipap&quot; meaning domestic hip-hop.

There are parallels between Korean hip-hop and American hip-hop, in that they follow a lot of trends from American hip-hop while adding their own elements to them, creating their sound from sounds widely popularised from American music.

=== Globalization ===
Since 2010, Korean hip-hop music started to gain international popularity. Epik High is credited as the first Korean hip-hop musician to succeed in the international market. In 2014, with their album &quot;Shoebox&quot;, Epik High reached the #1 spot on the Billboard World Albums Chart. Epik High also held a North American tour and played in U.S. music and film festival SXSW in 2015 before becoming the first major Korean group to play at U.S. music festival Coachella in 2016. Epik High became one of the most talked about artists with #EpikHigh as one of the most used hashtags at the festival. Tablo in an interview with NBC News explains why hip-hop and rap are resonating with a lot of people nowadays stating, “…rap is an art form that is very welcoming of youth culture and youth idea.” After finishing their contract with YG Entertainment in 2018, Epik High started another North American tour in 2019.

The interest in &quot;SMTM&quot; has also spread abroad, with rappers who participated in the show&#x27;s fourth season performing in the United States in 2015. The show also held auditions for its fifth season in Los Angeles in 2016. Although critical questions were posed, SMTM started self-positioning itself as a “global hip-hop battle” since season 5. The popularity of &quot;SMTM&quot; led to other Korean hip-hop artists, including the rosters of popular record labels Illionaire Records, AOMG, and Amoeba Culture, to tour around the world. AOMG toured China and the United States in 2016, South East Asia in 2017, and North America and Europe in 2019. Amoeba Culture and Illionaire Records also toured the United States in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

The incorporation of trap music in Korean hip-hop has become a major factor to its growing success overseas. Though less popular in his native South Korea, rapper Keith Ape became a viral sensation in 2015 with his song, &quot;It G Ma.&quot; The song is credited with helping expand Korean hip-hop&#x27;s audience abroad. He has stated in a Complex interview, “It&#x27;s important to me to be acknowledged by the birthplace of hip-hop culture and I&#x27;m thankful for everything that&#x27;s happened. Many Western people who don&#x27;t speak Korean now know the phrase ‘It G Ma’.” The following year, Eung Freestyle (응프리스타일) performed by DPR Live, Sik-K, Punchnello, Owen Ovadoz, and Flowsik gained attention with the help of Youtube&#x27;s Music&#x27;s Ad Campaign.

Korean hip-hop artists are continuously making a deliberate effort to expand their presence in the global market, especially in the North American Market. On July 20, 2017, Jay Park officially became part of Jay-Z&#x27;s record label Roc Nation. He posted on his Instagram account stating, “This is a win for the Town, this is a win for Korea, this is a win for Asian Americans…” In 2019, MBC launched a new program titled &quot;Target: Billboard – Kill Bill&quot;. The show enlisted renowned hip-hop artists to compete for a chance to collaborate with DJ Khaled. In doing so, the program&#x27;s ultimate goal is for Korean hip-hop artists to &quot;kill the &quot;Billboard&quot;&quot; charts.

== Criticism ==
While most artists label their music as “Korean hip-hop” in their lyrics or interviews; some musicians consciously move away from it by calling their music just “hip-hop.” Some artists confessed their discomfort in labeling their music as “Korean” hip-hop claiming that they would rather have their music be heard as hip-hop. These artists wanted their music to be placed within global hip-hop and alongside what is currently being produced in America. Dok2, one of the most recognized figures in the Korean hip-hop scene, once mentioned, &quot;We are sharing a global trend. It is not a Korean musician copying an American song, but rather sharing a musical trend as one of the many hip-hop musicians in the world. I simply think of my music like this: Can I imagine this song being released in America and not just in Korea? Will people like it? Does it not drift away from the bigger picture? If we listen to it alongside what is topping the iTunes hip-hop chart, does it fit there? If I look at other Korean rappers’ music, it does not fit at all. Of course, there is a trend that is uniquely Korean, but that is &quot;gayo&quot;. That is K-pop and not hip-hop.&quot;

== Non-musical aspects ==
=== B-boying scene ===

B-boying, also known as break dancing, was introduced to South Korea in the 1980s by dance clubs in the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul, which was frequented by U.S. military personnel and other foreigners. There are different opinions on what truly counts as the first group that started the trend of incorporating elements of break dance into korean music, but the earliest example is the group UCDC (United College Dance Club) formed by Lee Sung Moon. Dance crew called &quot;Rhythm touch&quot; was initially influential,as they were back dancers for singers Insooni and Kim Wan-sun. In 1983, Lee also founded the breaking dance group &quot;Spark&quot;, which is also cited as the first Korean breaking dance group. One of the most famous venues these early dance groups learned thesr skills from was a club called Moonnight in Itaewon, which was originally a foreigners only club. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 2001 that Korean b-boys received international recognition when the dance crew Visual Shock won &quot;best show&quot; and fourth place at Battle of the Year, the biggest b-boy competition in the world. Korean crews went on to win either first or second place at the competition for the next several years.

In 2007, the Korean Tourism Organization founded an international b-boying competition called R-16 Korea. The event, which draws tens of thousands of spectators to Seoul each year, is also highly profitable for the South Korean government. South Korean hip-hop artists, including Jay Park, Yoon Mi-rae, and Drunken Tiger&#x27;s Tiger JK, have performed at R-16.

B-boying has also experienced popularity in South Korean theater, including, notably, the musical, &quot;Ballerina Who Loved a B-Boy&quot;, which premiered in South Korea in 2005 with performances in other countries, including Singapore, Japan, China, Guam, Colombia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The show was still staged daily in South Korea as of 2013.

=== Fashion ===
Fashion-wise, many South Korean youths prefer hip-hop taste. hip-hop urban wear or streetwear usually goes hand in hand with the K-hip-hop scene, now becoming mainstream. YG Entertainment, one of the biggest hip-hop promoters in South Korea, does a few sponsorship deals in clothing. YG artist, Jinusean&#x27;s Sean started his own clothing company called MF (Majah Flavah). On June 28, 2012, YG agreed with Cheil Industries to launch their fashion brand catering not only to Korean teens but also to the global fashion market. The first NONAGON store opened in September and sold out within 3 days. YG artists Bobby and B.I. also promoted the brand by wearing the clothing to SMTM3.

Each show had a theme that changed daily. These included &quot;Around the House&quot;, &quot;Family Day&quot;, &quot;Home Day&quot;, and &quot;Fashion Friday&quot;. It was Canada&#x27;s longest running daytime show specifically targeted to women. The show also aired in the United States on the Dabl digital multicast network and was syndicated on local television stations.

==History==
&quot;CityLine&quot; debuted in February 1984, originally hosted by Dini Petty. The show was hosted by Marilyn Denis between September 1989 and May 23, 2008. Subsequent to Denis&#x27;s departure to host &quot;The Marilyn Denis Show&quot; for CTV, a series of guest hosts were used, including Jessica Holmes, Jennifer Valentyne, Jody Vance, Liz West, Dina Pugliese, Christine Cardoso, Tracy Moore, Catherine Marion and Nalini Sharma. Moore was named the new permanent host in 2008. 

Prior to fall 2008, &quot;Cityline&quot; was aired live. However, from 2008 to 2024 &quot;Cityline&quot; was taped in advance and then aired two weeks from the date it was recorded.

In 2024, Rogers announced the cancellation of &quot;CityLine&quot;; the show&#x27;s final episode aired on May 3. It was announced that the show would be replaced by a new lifestyle-oriented hour of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; hosted by Moore. It was later announced that former &quot;ET Canada&quot; host Cheryl Hickey would co-host the new hour—&quot;BT with Tracy and Cheryl&quot;. The program was originally slated to premiere in September 2024, but was delayed; the network subsequently announced in January 2025 that the new program would not proceed.

==&quot;Toronto&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;==
&quot;Toronto&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; was broadcast as a segment on &quot;Cityline&quot;&#x27;s Fashion Fridays in May 2005. Ten aspiring models were selected from over 1,000 applicants and judged on live television. To promote the connection to &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, &quot;Cityline&quot; invited &quot;ANTM&quot; stylist Jay Manuel as a guest on the final episode.

The winner was decided by three high-profile fashion industry professionals, and influenced by an online vote open to the Canadian public. The judges were Elmer Olsen, head of Elmer Olsen Models, Ceri Marsh, editor of &quot;Fashion&quot; magazine, and Lisa Rogers, one of Canada&#x27;s first top international models and now a consultant on &quot;Cityline&quot;.

The winner, Lisa Caroline Leung, of Toronto, walked away with a modeling contract from Elmer Olsen Models, the chance to model on &quot;Cityline&quot;, a fashion shoot with fashion photographer Gabor Jurina and a spread in the 2005 summer issue of &quot;Fashion&quot; magazine. Leung was the first multiracial person to ever win any of the &quot;Top Model&quot; competitions or competition spin-offs.

<doc id="690276" wikidata="Q708144" url="?curid=690276" title="Billy Gunn">
<text>Monty Kip Sopp (born November 1, 1963), better known by his ring name Billy Gunn, is an American professional wrestler and coach signed to All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he also performs under the ring name Daddy Ass. He was a member of The Acclaimed as a manager and the team&#x27;s six-man tag team partner.

He was previously known for his tenures in World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (WWF/E) from 1993 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2015, while also serving as a coach on WWE&#x27;s &quot;Tough Enough&quot; and was a trainer in NXT. He also wrestled for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling from 2005 to 2009.

Primarily a tag team wrestler, Gunn is an overall 11-time tag team champion in WWE with three different partners (with Bart Gunn as The Smoking Gunns; with Road Dogg as The New Age Outlaws; and with Chuck Palumbo as Billy and Chuck). He is also a former one-time WWF Intercontinental Champion and a two-time WWF Hardcore Champion, giving him 14 total championships in WWE. He also won the 1999 King of the Ring tournament, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2019 as a member of D-Generation X. At AEW, Gunn is a former one-time and longest reigning AEW World Trios Champions with The Acclaimed (Max Caster and Anthony Bowens).

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1989–1993) ===
Gunn trained as a bull rider while attending Oviedo High School in Oviedo, Florida. After a stint as a professional bull rider in Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association, Sopp left the profession in his early 20s in order to pursue a career as a professional wrestler. Trained by Jerry Gray, Sopp wrestled on the independent circuit for eight years (including a brief stint as enhancement talent for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) before signing a contract with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1993.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1993–2004)===

==== The Smoking Gunns (1993–1996) ====
After weeks of vignettes, Sopp, under the name Billy Gunn, made his WWF debut on the May 17, 1993, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, teaming with his on-screen brother, Bart Gunn to defeat Tony Vadja and Glenn Ruth. The duo, now known as The Smoking Gunns, made their pay-per-view debut at King of the Ring, teaming with The Steiner Brothers to defeat Money Inc. and The Headshrinkers in an eight-man tag team match. At SummerSlam, the duo teamed with Tatanka to pick up a win against Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers. On January 22, 1994, Gunn entered his first Royal Rumble match at the namesake event, but was eliminated by Diesel. In early 1995, the Gunns won their first Tag Team Championship by defeating the makeshift team of Bob Holly and 1-2-3 Kid. They held the title until WrestleMania XI, where they were defeated by the team of Owen Hart and Yokozuna. They won the titles again in September 1995.

On February 15, 1996, the Gunns vacated the title because Billy was in need of neck surgery. After Billy returned from hiatus, The Smoking Gunns won the Tag Team Title for the third time by defeating The Godwinns in May. After the match, The Godwinns&#x27; manager Sunny turned on her team in favor of the Gunns. On September 22 at In Your House: Mind Games, the Gunns lost the Tag Team Title to Owen Hart and The British Bulldog. After the match, Sunny abandoned The Gunns, saying that she would only manage title holders. Billy, frustrated with losing both the championship and Sunny, walked out on Bart, breaking up The Smoking Gunns. The two would feud in late 1996.

====Rockabilly, The New Age Outlaws and D-Generation X (1997–1998) ====

After The Smoking Gunns disbanded, Gunn took some time off to nurse an injury. At WrestleMania 13, he defeated Flash Funk catching the attention of The Honky Tonk Man, who made Gunn his protégé. During this time, he adopted a new gimmick, Rockabilly, He would use this gimmick throughout much of 1997 and eventually had a short-lived feud with &quot;The Real Double J&quot; Jesse James. On the October 4, 1997, episode of &quot;Shotgun Saturday Night&quot;, James realized both of their careers were going nowhere and suggested that they become a tag team. Gunn agreed and smashed a guitar over the Honky Tonk Man&#x27;s head to solidify their new alliance.

James and Rockabilly were quickly rebranded as &quot;Road Dogg&quot; Jesse James and &quot;Badd Ass&quot; Billy Gunn, respectively, and their tag team was dubbed the New Age Outlaws. They quickly rose to the top of the tag team ranks and won the Tag Team Championship from the Legion of Doom on November 24. They also defeated the LOD in a rematch at In Your House: D-Generation X.
The Outlaws slowly began to align themselves with D-Generation X. At the Royal Rumble, the New Age Outlaws interfered in a casket match to help Shawn Michaels defeat The Undertaker. At No Way Out Of Texas, the Outlaws teamed up with Triple H and Savio Vega (who replaced the injured Shawn Michaels) to face Chainsaw Charlie, Cactus Jack, Owen Hart, and Steve Austin. They were, however, defeated. On February 2, The Outlaws locked Cactus and Chainsaw in a dumpster and pushed it off the stage. This led to a dumpster match at WrestleMania XIV where Cactus and Chainsaw defeated the Outlaws for the Tag Titles. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, the New Age Outlaws won the Tag Team Championship for a second time by defeating Chainsaw and Cactus in a steel cage match, but only after interference from Triple H, Chyna, and X-Pac. After the match, the Outlaws officially became members of D-Generation X (DX).

After joining DX, the Outlaws successfully defended their Tag Team Title against the Legion of Doom 2000 at Unforgiven. DX began to feud with Owen Hart and his new stablemates, The Nation. At Over The Edge, the Outlaws and Triple H were defeated by Nation members Owen, Kama Mustafa, and D&#x27;Lo Brown in a Six Man Tag Match.

During this time, the Outlaws began a feud with Kane and Mankind. At SummerSlam, Mankind faced the Outlaws in a Handicap match after Kane no-showed the title defense. The Outlaws defeated Mankind to win the titles for the third time. In December, the Outlaws lost the title to The Big Boss Man and Ken Shamrock from The Corporation.

==== Mr. Ass and reformation of the Outlaws and DX (1999–2000) ====

The Outlaws then began to focus more on singles competition. Road Dogg won the Hardcore Championship in December 1998, and Gunn set his sights on the Intercontinental Championship. At the 1999 Royal Rumble, Gunn unsuccessfully challenged Ken Shamrock for the Intercontinental Title. The next month at St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, Gunn was the special guest referee for the Intercontinental Championship match between Val Venis and champion Ken Shamrock, where Gunn made a fast count and declared Venis the new champion before attacking both men.

In March, Gunn won the Hardcore Championship from Hardcore Holly. At WrestleMania XV, Gunn lost the title to Holly in a Triple Threat match which also included Al Snow. The New Age Outlaws then reunited to defeat Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart at Backlash. After Backlash, Gunn left D-Generation X and aligned himself with Triple H and Chyna. Gunn defeated his former partner, Road Dogg, in a match at Over the Edge. Gunn then won the King of the Ring tournament by defeating Ken Shamrock, Kane, and his former ally, X-Pac. After King of the Ring, Gunn, Triple H, and Chyna went on to feud with X-Pac and Road Dogg over the rights to the D-Generation X name. This feud culminated at Fully Loaded when X-Pac and Road Dogg defeated Gunn and Chyna.

Gunn then began a brief feud with The Rock. At SummerSlam, The Rock defeated Gunn in a Kiss My Ass Match. Following this, Gunn then briefly feuded with Jeff Jarrett for the Intercontinental Title before reuniting with Road Dogg to reform The New Age Outlaws. The Outlaws won their fourth tag team championship by defeating The Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Sock Connection in September 1999. The Outlaws later reunited with X-Pac and Triple H to reform D-Generation X. During this time, The Outlaws won their fifth Tag Team Championship after defeating Mankind and Al Snow. At the 2000 Royal Rumble, The New Age Outlaws retained their title against The Acolytes after interference from X-Pac. The Outlaws then had a feud with The Dudley Boyz, who won the Tag Team Championship from The Outlaws at No Way Out. After suffering a torn rotator cuff in the match with The Dudley Boyz, Gunn was kicked out of D-Generation X for &quot;losing his cool&quot; to explain his impending absence to recover from his injury.

==== The One (2000–2001) ====
Gunn made his return in October and immediately teamed with Chyna to feud with Right to Censor, who wanted to &quot;censor&quot; his Mr. Ass gimmick. At No Mercy, Right to Censor members Steven Richards and Val Venis defeated Chyna and Gunn. Due to a stipulation in a match with Steven Richards on the October 31 episode of Monday Night Raw from the Fleet Center in Boston, Massachusetts, Gunn could no longer use the Mr. Ass gimmick, so he renamed himself Billy G. for a few weeks before settling on &quot;The One&quot; Billy Gunn. Gunn then feuded with Eddie Guerrero and the rest of The Radicalz. At Survivor Series, Gunn teamed with Road Dogg, Chyna, and K-Kwik in a losing effort against The Radicalz. A few weeks later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Gunn won the Intercontinental Championship from Guerrero. However, the title reign was short-lived, as Chris Benoit defeated him for the title two weeks later at Armageddon. After feuding with Benoit, Gunn participated in the 2001 Royal Rumble where he made it to the final four, Gunn interfered in the Hardcore Championship Match at No Way Out, and taking advantage of the 24/7 Rule, pinning Raven for the title. The reign was short-lived, as Raven won it back a few minutes later.

==== Billy and Chuck (2001–2002) ====

In a 2001 match on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot;, Gunn was defeated by Chuck Palumbo, who recently left The Alliance to join the WWF. After the match, Gunn suggested that they form a tag team. Palumbo agreed, and Billy and Chuck quickly rose to the top of the tag team division. Initially they were a generic tandem, but they were given a gimmick where they grew increasingly affectionate toward each other, showing evidence of a storyline homosexual relationship.

In February 2002, Billy and Chuck defeated Spike Dudley and Tazz to win the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time as a team. After winning the titles, Billy and Chuck found a &quot;Personal Stylist&quot; in the ambiguously flamboyant Rico. After retaining the title against the Acolytes Protection Agency, the Dudley Boyz, and the Hardy Boyz in a Four Corners Elimination Match at WrestleMania X8 and against Al Snow and Maven at Backlash, Billy and Chuck began a feud with Rikishi. At Judgment Day, Rikishi and Rico (Rikishi&#x27;s mystery partner of Mr. McMahon&#x27;s choosing) defeated Billy and Chuck for the WWE Tag Team Championship after Rico accidentally hit Chuck with a roundhouse kick. Billy and Chuck quickly won the title back two weeks later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; with Rico&#x27;s help. They held the championship for almost a month before losing it to the team of Edge and Hollywood Hulk Hogan on the July 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;.

On the September 5 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, after Billy lost a match to Rey Mysterio, Chuck proposed to Billy, asking him to be his &quot;partner for life&quot; and gave him a wedding ring. Billy agreed, and one week later, on the September 12 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Billy and Chuck had their wedding ceremony. However, just before they tied the knot, they revealed that the entire ordeal was a publicity stunt and disavowed their on-screen homosexuality, admitting that they were just friends. The &quot;preacher&quot; revealed himself to be Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff (who was wearing a skin mask), who then summoned 3-Minute Warning to beat up Billy and Chuck. Rico, furious that Billy and Chuck gave up their gimmick, became the manager of Three Minute Warning and defected to &quot;Raw&quot;. At Unforgiven, Three Minute Warning defeated Billy and Chuck. Their final match together occurred on the October 3 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in the first round of a tournament for the newly created WWE Tag Team Championship. They lost the match to the team of Ron Simmons and Reverend D-Von. Afterwards, Gunn took a few months off because of a shoulder injury and the team of Billy and Chuck quietly disbanded.

==== SmackDown! and return to singles competition (2003–2004) ====
After returning in June 2003, Gunn reverted to the &quot;Mr. Ass&quot; gimmick, defeating A-Train, and Torrie Wilson became his new manager. He started a feud with Jamie Noble, which led to an &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; Match at Vengeance, which Noble won and due to the match&#x27;s stipulation, won a night with Torrie. After taking time off again due to a shoulder injury, Gunn returned to action at the 2004 Royal Rumble, but was eliminated by Goldberg. Afterward, he wrestled mainly on &quot;Velocity&quot;, forming an occasional tag team with Hardcore Holly. At Judgment Day, Gunn and Holly challenged Charlie Haas and Rico for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful. At The Great American Bash, Gunn lost to Kenzo Suzuki. Afterwards, he mainly wrestled on WWE Velocity and house shows until that August.

On November 1, 2004, Sopp was released from his WWE contract. In June 2005, Sopp gave an interview in which he was heavily critical of WWE and the events that led to his release. Many of the negative comments were directed towards Triple H, who Sopp claimed &quot;runs the show up there&quot;.

=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2009) ===

==== Planet Jarrett (2005) ====
On February 13, 2005, Sopp debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) without a name (as Billy Gunn is a WWE trademark, although announcers recognized him as such) at Against All Odds with the same gimmick, helping Jeff Jarrett retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in a match with Kevin Nash. Sopp, using the name The New Age Outlaw, then formed a stable with Jarrett and Monty Brown known as Planet Jarrett. However, WWE threatened TNA with legal action if Sopp continued the use of the name &quot;The New Age Outlaw&quot;, so he shortened his name to The Outlaw. Due to the legal issues with WWE, all TNA -DVD releases featuring footage with Sopp as &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (and presumably also as &quot;The New Age Outlaw&quot;) have had the name on on-screen graphics blurred, the name silenced out of the audio, and match commentary completely replaced to reflect a retroactive name change to &quot;Kip James&quot;. One such DVD is the pay-per-view Lockdown, included in the &quot;TNA Anthology: The Epic Set&quot; box set, in which the silencing of the name during a segment where Dusty Rhodes picks his name from a lottery leaves DVD viewers in the dark as to who just got picked.

The Outlaw began a campaign to make former ally B.G. James leave the 3Live Kru and defect to Planet Jarrett, reforming the old tag team with Outlaw. At No Surrender, he renamed himself Kip James and was announced as &quot;wrestling out of Marietta, Georgia&quot; (the family seat of the Armstrong family) as a psychological ploy. As a result of his campaign, Kip attracted the ire of 3Live Kru members Ron Killings and Konnan, leading to a series of tag team matches pitting Kip and Monty Brown against Killings and Konnan, with a conflicted James unwilling to take sides. Kip&#x27;s efforts ultimately proved futile; James, the guest referee in a final match between Brown and Kip versus Konnan and Killings at Sacrifice, attacked Kip enabling a 3Live Kru victory.

In September at Unbreakable, Kip teamed with Brown to defeat the team of Apolo and Lance Hoyt. There was clear tension between the partners because Brown was unhappy at the series of losses at the hands of the 3Live Kru, and Kip was irked by Brown&#x27;s decision to leave Planet Jarrett. Despite the victory, the partners argued after the match. On the October 8, 2005, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kip rekindled his feud with the 3Live Kru, running to the ring after a bout between the 3LK and Team Canada in order to prevent Team Canada captain Petey Williams from beating down B.G. James. He saved James, and then engaged in a staredown with Konnan and Killings. Kip saved James from Team Canada once again at Bound for Glory. Though Killings showed signs of gratitude, Konnan remained skeptical as to his true intentions. Later that night, Kip took part in an over-the-top-rope gauntlet match for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. After he was eliminated, he tried in vain to prevent Killings from being eliminated as well, before being sent away from ringside by the referees.

==== The James Gang/Voodoo Kin Mafia (2005–2008) ====

On the November 26 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, B.G. brought Kip and the 3Live Kru to ringside and asked Killings and Konnan whether Kip could join the stable. Following a heated argument between Konnan and B.G., both Killings and Konnan gave their approval, and the 4Live Kru was born. However, at Turning Point, Konnan attacked both B.G. and Kip, costing them their match against Team Canada and initiating a feud between himself and the remainder of the Kru. Shortly thereafter, B.G. James&#x27;s father, Bob Armstrong, attempted to reconcile the group, but was instead attacked by Konnan and his new stablemates, Apolo and Homicide. Killings later stated that he had severed his ties with the Kru. With Konnan and Killings no longer members of the Kru, Kip and B.G. began referring to themselves as The James Gang and continued to feud with the Konnan-managed Latin American Exchange, whose third man position as Homicide&#x27;s partner would switch from Apolo to Machete, and then from him to Hernandez, who finally stuck, during the course of this feud. At Final Resolution, The James Gang defeated The Diamonds in the Rough (David Young and Elix Skipper). At Against All Odds, The James Gang defeated LAX (Homicide and Machete). At Destination X, The James Gang and Bob Armstrong defeated Latin American Exchange in a six-man tag team match. At Sacrifice, The James Gang defeated Team 3D which led to a rematch at Slammiversary where Team 3D defeated The James Gang in a Bingo Hall Brawl. At Victory Road, The James Gang and Abyss defeated Team 3D and their newest member Brother Runt. At No Surrender, The James Gang competed in a Triple Chance tag team battle royal but failed to win the match. At Bound for Glory, The James Gang competed in a Four-way tag team match which was won by Team 3D.

By November 2006, Kip and B.G. began to show displeasure in TNA and threatened to go find work elsewhere if they did not receive gold soon. They began performing the crotch chop, a reference to the WWE&#x27;s DX. On the November 2 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Kip and B.G. threatened to quit. Kip grabbed the mic and tried to say something to the TNA administration and Spike TV, but each time his mic was cut off. Kip then tried to use the announcer&#x27;s headset, but it was cut off as well. Frustrated, he started yelling loudly to the crowd, but he was cut off again as the show went to a commercial break. When the show returned, the announcers speculated that they may have been frustrated due to the influx of new talent entering TNA. It was reported that the segment was a worked shoot that Vince Russo had written in order to renew interest upon their eventual return. Kip and BG appeared in an internet video on TNA&#x27;s website where they addressed the owner of WWE Vince McMahon.
A few weeks later on &quot;Impact!&quot;, The James Gang re-emerged under a new name Voodoo Kin Mafia (VKM for short, a play on Vincent Kennedy McMahon&#x27;s initials). They mentioned their new right of &#x27;creative control&#x27;, meaning they could do whatever they wanted. They also declared &#x27;war&#x27; on Paul Levesque, Michael Hickenbottom, and Vincent K. McMahon (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, and Vince McMahon, respectively). Kip then declared that &#x27;Triple Hollywood&#x27; and &#x27;Shawn Kiss-my-bottom&#x27; were failing as the group they (Kip and BG) used to be a part of: D-Generation X. After the initial shock value of this incident wore off, at Genesis, The Voodoo Kin Mafia defeated Kazarian, Maverick Matt and Johnny Devine in a handicap match. VKM began a feud with the villainous Christy Hemme. Hemme then searched for a tag team to square-off against VKM. At Destination X, The Voodoo Kin Mafia defeated Hemme&#x27;s handpicked team of The Heartbreakers (Antonio Thomas &amp; Romeo Roselli). On the Lockdown preshow The Voodoo Kin Mafia defeated another one of Hemme&#x27;s handpicked team Serotonin (Kaz &amp; Havok) in a Six Sides of Steel match. The final tag team was Damaja and Basham, who appeared on an episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and beat down VKM. They also held up Kip James so Hemme could slap him. B.G James was taken out by Basham and Damaja which led to Kip James competed against Basham and Damaja in a handicap match at Sacrifice where he lost. However, they beat Hemme&#x27;s team at Slammiversary. After the match, VKM were betrayed by their associate Lance Hoyt. At Victory Road, they introduced their new manager, the Voodoo Queen, Roxxi Laveaux, to embarrass Christy Hemme. At Hard Justice, The Voodoo Kin Mafia lost to The Latin American Exchange. At No Surrender, The Voodoo Kin Mafia competed in a Ten-team tag team gauntlet match which was won by A.J. Styles and Tomko. At Bound for Glory, Kip James competed in the Fight for the Right Reverse Battle Royal which was won by Eric Young. On the October 25 edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, VKM teamed with A.J. Styles and Tomko in a losing effort to the Latin American Xchange and the Steiner Brothers. At Genesis, B.G. was present along with Kip in the corner of Roxxi Laveaux at ringside for the Fatal Four Way knockout match for the TNA Women&#x27;s Championship in which Gail Kim retained the title. At Turning Point, James competed in the Feast or Fired where he grabbed a case but threw it to BG James. It was revealed that the case was for a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship and BG James picked his dad to be his partner at Against All Odds, James and Bob Armstrong failed to win the titles and on February 21, 2008, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; he turned on B.G. and B.G&#x27;s father &quot;Bullet&quot; Bob Armstrong by hitting them both with a crutch.

==== The Beautiful People (2008–2009) ====
On April 13, 2008, he faced former partner B.G. James at Lockdown and lost. After the match, he appeared to want to make amends as he raised B.G.&#x27;s hand after the match, only to clothesline him down to the mat and taunt him with a DX crotch chop. Kip went on to declare himself &quot;The Megastar&quot;, an arrogant gimmick similar to &quot;The One&quot; gimmick from his WWF tenure.

<text>The Republic of Yemen is divided into twenty-one governorates (&quot;muhafazah&quot;) and one municipality (amanah):

The governorates are subdivided into 333 districts (&quot;muderiah&quot;), which are subdivided into 1,996 sub-districts, and then into 40,793 villages and 88,817 sub villages (as of 2013).

Before 1990, Yemen existed as two separate entities. South Yemen consisted of modern Aden, Abyan, Mahrah, Dhale, Hadramaut, Socotra, Lahij, and Shabwah Governorates, while the rest made up North Yemen. For more information, see Historic Governorates of Yemen.

== List of governorates ==
Notes:&lt;br&gt;
a - Also known as Sanaa City, it is not part of any federal region&lt;br&gt;
b - Socotra Governorate was created in December 2013 from parts of the Hadhramaut Governorate, data included there

<doc id="690278" wikidata="Q12888920" url="?curid=690278" title="Choice">
<text>A choice is the range of different things from which a being can choose. The arrival at a choice may incorporate motivators and models. 

Freedom of choice is generally cherished, whereas a severely limited or artificially restricted choice can lead to discomfort with choosing, and possibly an unsatisfactory outcome. In contrast, a choice with excessively numerous options may lead to confusion, reduced satisfaction, regret of the alternatives not taken, and indifference in an unstructured existence;
and the illusion that choosing an object or a course, necessarily leads to the control of that object or course, can cause psychological problems.

==Types==
One can distinguish four or five main types of decisions, although they can be expressed in different ways. Brian Tracy breaks them down into:
# command decisions, which can only be made by you, as the &quot;Commander in Chief&quot;, or owner of a company
# delegated decisions, which may be made by anyone. Decisions for example can be: The color of the bike shed can be delegated, as the decision must be made but the choice is inconsequential.
# avoided decisions, where the outcome could be so severe that the choice should not be made, as the consequences can not be recovered from if the wrong choice is made. This will most likely result in negative actions, such as death.
# &quot;No-brainer&quot; decisions, where the choice is so obvious that only one choice can reasonably be made.
A fifth type, however, (or fourth if &quot;avoided&quot; and &quot;no-brainer&quot; decisions are combined as one type), is the collaborative decision, made in consultation with, and by agreement of others. Collaborative Decision Making revolutionized air-traffic safety by not deferring to the captain when a lesser crew-member becomes aware of a problem.

Another way of looking at decisions focuses on the thought mechanism used - whether the decision is:
* Rational
* Intuitive
* Recognition-based
* Combination

Recognizing that &quot;type&quot; is an imprecise term, an alternate way to classify types of choices is to look at outcomes and the impacted entity. For example, using this approach three types of choices might be:
* business 
* personal
* consumer
Or politicians may choose to support or oppose options based on local, national, or international effects.

As a moral principle, decisions should be made by those most affected by the decision, but this is not normally applied to persons in jail, who might likely make a decision other than to remain in jail. Robert Gates cited this principle in allowing photographs of returning war-dead.

One can distinguish between conscious and unconscious choice.
Processes such as brainwashing or other influencing strategies may have the effect of having unconscious choice masquerade as (praiseworthy) conscious choice.

Choices may lead to irreversible or to reversible outcomes; making irreversible choices (existential choices) may reduce choice overload.

==Evaluability in economics==
When choosing between options one must make judgments about the quality of each option&#x27;s attributes. For example, if one is choosing between candidates for a job, the quality of relevant attributes such as previous work experience, college or high school GPA, and letters of recommendation will be judged for each option and the decision will likely be based on these attribute judgments. However, each attribute has a different level of &quot;evaluability&quot;, that is, the extent to which one can use information from that attribute to make a judgment.

An example of a highly evaluable attribute is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good. Because the distribution of scores on this attribute is relatively well known it is a highly evaluable attribute. Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such as the number of hours spent doing homework. Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent doing homework means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.

As a result, evaluability can cause preference reversals between joint and separate evaluations. For example, a 1999 review and theoretical analysis looked at how people choose between options when they are directly compared because they are presented at the same time or when they cannot be compared because one is only given a single option. The canonical example is a hiring decision made about two candidates being hired for a programming job. Subjects in an experiment were asked to give a starting salary to two candidates, Candidate J and Candidate S. However, some viewed both candidates at the same time (joint evaluation), whereas others only viewed one candidate (separate evaluation). Candidate J had experience of 70 KY programs, and a GPA of 2.5, whereas Candidate S had experience of 10 KY programs and a GPA of 3.9. The results showed that in joint evaluation both candidates received roughly the same starting salary from subjects, who apparently thought a low GPA but high experience was approximately equal to a high GPA but low experience. However, in the separate evaluation, subjects paid Candidate S, the one with the high GPA, substantially more money. The explanation for this is that KY programs is an attribute that is difficult to evaluate and thus people cannot base their judgment on this attribute in separate evaluation.

==Number of options and paradox==
Several research studies in economic psychology have concentrated on examining the variations in individual behavior when confronted with a low versus high choice set size, which refers to the number of available options. A particular area of interest lies in determining whether individuals demonstrate a higher propensity to purchase a product from a larger choice set compared to a smaller one.Currently, the effect of choice set size on the probability of a purchase is unclear. In some cases, large choice set sizes discourage individuals from making a choice and in other cases it either encourages them or has no effect. One study compared the allure of more choice to the tyranny of too much choice. Individuals went virtual shopping in different stores that had a randomly determined set of choices ranging from 4 to 16, with some being good choices and some being bad. Researchers found a stronger effect for the allure of more choice. However, they speculate that due to random assignment of number of choices and goodness of those choices, many of the shops with fewer choices included zero or only one option that was reasonably good, which may have made it easier to make an acceptable choice when more options were available.

There is some evidence that while greater choice has the potential to improve a person&#x27;s welfare, sometimes there is such a thing as too much choice. For example, in one experiment involving a choice of free soda, individuals explicitly requested to choose from six as opposed to 24 sodas, where the only benefit from the smaller choice set would be to reduce the cognitive burden of the choice. A recent study supports this research, finding that human services workers indicated preferences for scenarios with limited options over extensive-options scenarios. As the number of choices within the extensive-options scenarios increased, the preference for limited options increased as well. Attempts to explain why choice can demotivate someone from a purchase have focuses on two factors. One assumes that perusing a larger number of choices imposes a cognitive burden on the individual. The other assumes that individuals can experience regret if they make a suboptimal choice, and sometimes avoid making a choice to avoid experiencing regret.

Further research has expanded on choice overload, suggesting that there is a paradox of choice. As increasing options are available, three problems emerge. First, there is the issue of gaining adequate information about the choices in order to make a decision. Second, having more choices leads to an escalation of expectation. When there are increased options, people&#x27;s standards for what is an acceptable outcome rise; in other words, choice &quot;spoils you.&quot; Third, with many options available, people may come to believe they are to blame for an unacceptable result because with so many choices, they should have been able to pick the best one. If there is one choice available, and it ends up being disappointing, the world can be held accountable. When there are many options and the choice that one makes is disappointing, the individual is responsible.

However, a recent meta-analysis of the literature on choice overload calls such studies into question. In many cases, researchers have found no effect of choice set size on people&#x27;s beliefs, feelings, and behavior. Indeed, overall, the effect of &quot;too many options&quot; is minimal at best.

While it might be expected that it is preferable to keep one&#x27;s options open, research has shown that having the opportunity to revise one&#x27;s decisions leaves people less satisfied with the decision outcome. A recent study found that participants experienced higher regret after having made a reversible decision. The results suggest that reversible decisions cause people to continue to think about the still relevant choice options, which might increase dissatisfaction with the decision and regret.

Individual personality plays a significant role in how individuals deal with large choice set sizes. Psychologists have developed a personality test that determines where an individual lies on the satisfier spectrum. A maximizer is one who always seeks the very best option from a choice set, and may anguish after the choice is made as to whether it was indeed the best. Satisfiers may set high standards but are content with a good choice, and place less priority on making the best choice. Due to this different approach to decision-making, maximizers are more likely to avoid making a choice when the choice set size is large, probably to avoid the anguish associated with not knowing whether their choice was optimal. One study looked at whether the differences in choice satisfaction between the two are partially due to a difference in willingness to commit to one&#x27;s choices. It found that maximizers reported a stronger preference for retaining the ability to revise choices. Additionally, after making a choice to buy a poster, satisfiers offered higher ratings of their chosen poster and lower ratings of the rejected alternatives. Maximizers, however, were less likely to change their impressions of the posters after making their choice which left them less satisfied with their decision.

Maximizers are less happy in life, perhaps due to their obsession with making optimal choices in a society where people are frequently confronted with choice. One study found that maximizers reported significantly less life satisfaction, happiness, optimism, and self-esteem, and significantly more regret and depression, than did satisfiers. In regards to buying products, maximizers were less satisfied with consumer decisions and were more regretful. They were also more likely to engage in social comparison, where they analyze their relative social standing among their peers, and to be more affected by social comparisons in which others appeared to be in higher standing than them. For example, maximizers who saw their peer solve puzzles faster than themselves expressed greater doubt about their own abilities and showed a larger increase in negative mood. On the other hand, people who refrain from taking better choices through drugs or other forms of escapism tend to be much happier in life.

Others say that there is never too much choice and that there is a difference between happiness and satisfaction: a person who tries to find better decisions will often be dissatisfied, but not necessarily unhappy since his attempts at finding better choices did improve his lifestyle (even if it wasn&#x27;t the &quot;best decision&quot; he will continually try to &quot;incrementally improve&quot; the decisions he takes).

Choice architecture is the process of encouraging people to make good choices through grouping and ordering the decisions in a way that maximizes successful choices and minimizes the number of people who become so overwhelmed by complexity that they abandon the attempt to choose. Generally, success is improved by presenting the smaller or simpler choices first, and by choosing and promoting sensible default options.

==Relationship to identity==

Certain choices, as personal preferences, can be central to expressing one&#x27;s concept of self-identity or values. In general, the more utilitarian an item, the less the choice says about a person&#x27;s self-concept. Purely functional items, such as a fire extinguisher, may be chosen solely for function alone, but non-functional items, such as music, clothing fashions, or home decorations, may instead be chosen to express a person&#x27;s concept of self-identity or associated values.

A 2014 review of previous studies on choice investigated how synchronic (changing) and diachronic (persisting) identity can influence choices and decisions that an individual makes and especially in consumer choices. The synchronic dimension of identity is more about the various parts of an identity and how these shifting aspects can change behavior. The diachronic dimension of identity is how a person’s identity persists and is the same and how they understand an object in relation to their identity. They found that stereotypes in concepts like gender norms play a big role in decision-making and that this might stem from significant historical beliefs in gender roles and identity.

== Attitudes ==
As part of his thinking on choiceless awareness, Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895–1986) pointed out the confusions and bias of exercising choice.

Sophia Rosenfeld analyses critical reactions to choice in her 2014 review
of some of the work of Iyengar,
Ben-Porath,
Greenfield,
and Salecl.

A study was conducted that looked into how attitude towards a particular brand would influence choice of a brand as it is being advertised. A picture of running shoes was created to either make the ad look good or bad and participants were asked to choose between four different brands. The attitude toward the add (Aad) shows to have a significant impact on choice of brand as well as the act of buying the brand (AB). This suggests that the attitude one had towards a brand can influence the choice and the intention to buy a particular item.

<doc id="690287" wikidata="Q949699" url="?curid=690287" title="Brazilian National Congress">
<text>The National Congress () is the legislative body of Brazil&#x27;s federal government. Unlike the state legislative assemblies and municipal chambers, the Congress is bicameral, composed of the Federal Senate (the upper house) and the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house). The Congress meets annually in Brasília from 2 February to 22 December, with a mid-term break taking place between 17 July and 1 August.

The Senate represents the 26 states and the Federal District. Each state and the Federal District has a representation of three senators, who are elected by popular ballot for a term of eight years. Every four years, renewal of either one third or two-thirds of the Senate (and of the delegations of the States and the Federal District) takes place. The Chamber of Deputies represents the people of each state, and its members are elected for a four-year term by a system of proportional representation. Seats are allotted proportionally according to each state&#x27;s population, with each state eligible for a minimum of 8 seats (least populous) and a maximum of 70 seats (most populous). Unlike the Senate, the whole of the Chamber of Deputies is renewed every four years.

Until recently it was common for politicians to switch parties and the proportion of congressional seats held by each party would often change. Seats belong to the parties and not to the politicians; one can only change parties and retain his or her seat in a very limited set of cases. Politicians who abandon the party for which they were elected now face the loss of their congressional seat. Each house of the Brazilian Congress elects its president and the other members of its directing board from among its members. The President of the Senate is &quot;ex officio&quot; the President of the National Congress, and in that capacity summons and presides over joint sessions, as well as over the joint services of both houses. The President of the Chamber is second in the presidential line of succession while the President of the Senate (and of Congress) is third.

== Board of the National Congress ==
The current composition of the Board of the National Congress is as follows:

== Houses ==

=== Federal Senate ===

The Federal Senate () is the upper house of the National Congress created by the first Constitution of the Brazilian Empire in 1824; it was inspired by United Kingdom&#x27;s House of Lords, but with the Proclamation of the Republic in 1889 it became closer to the United States Senate.
Currently, the Senate comprises 81 seats. Three senators from each of the 26 states and three senators from the Federal District are elected on a majority basis to serve eight-year terms. Elections are staggered so that two-thirds of the upper house is up for election at one time and the remaining one-third four years later. When one seat is up for election in each State, each voter casts one vote for the Senate; when two seats are up for election, each voter casts two votes, and the voter cannot give his two votes for the same candidate, but, in elections for the renewal of two-thirds of the Senate, each party can present two candidates for election. The candidate in each State and the Federal District (or the first two candidates, when two-thirds of the seats are up for election) who achieve the greatest plurality of votes are elected.

=== Chamber of Deputies ===

The Chamber of Deputies () is the lower house of the National Congress, it is composed of 513 federal deputies, who are elected by a proportional representation of votes to serve a four-year term. Seats are allotted proportionally according to each state&#x27;s population, with each state eligible for a minimum of 8 seats (least populous) and a maximum of 70 seats (most populous).

In 2018, 24 out of the country&#x27;s 33 political parties were able to elect at least one representative in the Chamber, while sixteen of them were able to elect at least one senator.

== Building ==

In early 1900s, the Brazilian National Congress happened to be in separate buildings in Rio de Janeiro which was then the national capital. The Senate was located near Railway Central Station, beside the Republica Square, at Moncorvo Filho Street, where there is today a Federal University of Rio de Janeiro students&#x27; center. The Federal Chamber of Deputies was located at Misericórdia Street, which would later be the location of the State of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s local Chamber of Deputies. From the 1930s to early 1960s, the Senate occupied the Monroe Palace, which was demolished in the 1970s to allow the construction of the subway Cinelândia Station. The Federal Chamber of Deputies moved to Brasília in the early 1960s, a process that took years to complete.

Since the 1960s, the National Congress has been located in Brasília. Like most of the city&#x27;s government buildings, the National Congress building was designed by Oscar Niemeyer.

The semi-sphere on the left is the seat of the Senate, and the semi-sphere on the right is the seat of the Chamber of the Deputies. Between them are two vertical office towers.

The building is located in the middle of the Monumental Axis, the main street of Brasília. In front of it there is a large lawn where demonstrations take place. At the back of it, is the Praça dos Três Poderes (&#x27;Three Powers Plaza&#x27;), where lies the Palácio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court.

On 6 December 2007, the Institute of Historic and Artistic National Heritage () decided to declare the building of the National Congress a historical heritage of the Brazilian people. The building has also been a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as part of Brasília&#x27;s original urban buildings, since 1987.

=== 2023 storming ===

On 8 January 2023, supporters of the former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded and vandalized the Brazilian National Congress as well as other federal buildings in Brasília.

== Legislatures ==
The legislatures are counted from the first meeting of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate, on 6 May 1826, in the imperial era (the Chamber of Deputies met for preparatory sessions from 29 April 1826 onwards to elect its officers and conduct other preliminary business, but the legislature was formally opened on 6 May). The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate were created by Brazil&#x27;s first Constitution, the Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, adopted in 1824. The previous Constituent and Legislative Assembly of the Empire of Brazil, a unicameral National Assembly, that was convened in 1823 and dissolved by Emperor Pedro I before adopting a Constitution is not counted among the legislatures. Thus, the numbering includes only the bicameral legislatures that existed from 1826 to the present day, and includes only legislatures elected after the adoption of the first Brazilian Constitution.

In the imperial era, the national legislature was named &quot;General Assembly&quot;. It was made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Senators were elected for life and the Senate was a permanent institution, whereas the Chamber of Deputies, unless dissolved earlier, was elected every four years. When Brazil became a Republic and a Federal State, the model of a bicameral legislature was retained at the Federal level, but the Parliament was renamed &quot;National Congress&quot;. The National Congress is made up of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Both Houses have fixed terms and cannot be dissolved earlier. Under Brazil&#x27;s present constitution, adopted in 1988, senators are elected for an eight-year term, and deputies are elected every four years.

The numbering of the legislatures is continuous, including the legislatures of the imperial General Assembly and of the republican National Congress. The inauguration of a new composition of Chamber of Deputies for a four-year term of office marks the start of a new legislature.

<doc id="690290" wikidata="Q1053630" url="?curid=690290" title="Provinces of Papua New Guinea">
<text>For administrative purposes, Papua New Guinea is divided into administrative divisions called provinces. There are 22 provincial-level divisions, which include 20 provinces, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville, and the National Capital District of Port Moresby.

In 2009, the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea created two additional provinces, that officially came into being on 17 May 2012. They were Hela Province, which was split from Southern Highlands Province, and Jiwaka Province, which was split from Western Highlands Province.

Each province forms a provincial electorate, called a constituency, for the PNG national parliament. The 22 provincial members are chosen from single-member electorates. Each provincial member becomes governor of their province unless they take a ministerial position, in which case the governorship passes to an open member of the province.

== History ==
Immediately before independence on 16 September 1975, Papua New Guinea was divided into nineteen provinces and the National Capital District. These provinces corresponded to the &quot;Districts&quot; of the pre-Independence administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.

=== The Bougainville issue ===

It had been considered that an independent state with limited resources could ill afford the infrastructure of a two-level quasi-federal governmental structure. However, a secessionist movement in Bougainville, whose copper mine provided the largest single source of foreign exchange and whose contribution to the general revenue was crucial to the independent state&#x27;s economic viability, forced the issue. The Bougainville secession movement declared the Republic of the North Solomons on 1 September 1975 and the central government very quickly responded by offering provincial status to Bougainville. For the sake of consistency, as there were or had been regional separatist movements in Papua and East New Britain, provincial status was offered to the other 18 Districts as well.

Bougainville continues to be a special case. A renewed secession movement emerged in 1988 and resulted in a violent military campaign on the island, the closing of the Bougainville Copper Mine with serious financial consequences for the central government, the destruction or running-down of most infrastructure on the island and, ultimately, the total quarantining of the province for a decade. The Sandline affair of 1997 was a political scandal that became one of the defining moments in Papua New Guinea&#x27;s history, particularly that of the conflict in Bougainville.

The Bougainville secessionists came to terms with the central government in 1997. A constitution was drafted for a more autonomous regional polity within Papua New Guinea with its own president and provisions for a referendum on total autonomy in due course.

==Government==
Until 1995, the provinces had elected provincial assemblies and cabinets led by premiers; however, the country remained unitary, not federal. Unlike Canada, Australia, and the United States, whose federal governments are creatures of the provinces or states, but as with the provinces and states of Pakistan and India, the provinces are creatures of the central government and can be suspended by it or have their boundaries changed. Indeed, there have been suspensions of several provincial governments to address corruption or incompetence by elected provincial governments. Changes in the boundaries of those provinces which are adjacent to the former boundary between the Territories of Papua and New Guinea can cause special complications in the administration of statutes that apply in Papua or New Guinea but not both.

Ultimately in June 1995, in an effort to re-assert a measure of control by the central government over the often wayward provinces in an environment of limited numbers of personnel qualified for public office in many of the provinces, the office of the provincial premier was abolished and the regional (at-large) members of Parliament became provincial governors, while also retaining their seats in Parliament.

==Naming of provinces==
Several provincial governments have adopted a local name for their province. For example, Bougainville became North Solomons, Western became Fly River, Chimbu became Simbu, Northern became Oro, and West Sepik became Sandaun.

Though these names are accorded popular acceptance, they remain unofficial, as formal changes in province names require amendments to the Constitution, using the prescribed amending formula.

==New provinces==
In May 2012, two new provinces were established: Hela Province was split from Southern Highlands Province and Jiwaka Province from Western Highlands Province.

==List of provinces==
For administrative purposes, Papua New Guinea is divided into four regions and also into 22 provinces, as follows (they are numbered according to the map on the top right):


==Regions==

On a broader scale, PNG is divided into four regions. The regions are significant in daily life and are often the basis for the organisation of government services, corporate operations, sporting competitions, and even the machinations of politics. For instance, there has been much discussion over the years of how many Prime Ministers have come from each region, and whether a particular region is due to provide the next one. Ministers and departmental heads are often appointed to maintain an overall balance between the regions.

People generally identify quite strongly with their region, and inter-region rivalries can be intense. The four regions are:

*Highlands Region: Simbu, Eastern Highlands, Enga, Hela, Jiwaka, Southern Highlands, and Western Highlands.
*Islands Region: East New Britain, Manus, New Ireland, Bougainville (North Solomons), and West New Britain.
*Momase Region: East Sepik, Madang, Morobe, and West Sepik (Sandaun). (&quot;Momase&quot; is a recently devised word which combines the first two letters of &quot;Morobe&quot;, &quot;Madang&quot;, and &quot;Sepik&quot;.)
*Southern Region: Central, Gulf, Milne Bay, Northern Province (Oro), Western (Fly), and the National Capital District.

<doc id="690293" wikidata="Q726992" url="?curid=690293" title="Torquay, Victoria">
<text>Torquay ( ) is a town in Surf Coast Shire, Victoria, Australia, which faces Bass Strait, 21 km south of Geelong and is the gateway to the Great Ocean Road. It is bordered on the west by Spring Creek and its coastal features include Point Danger and Zeally Bay. At the 2021 census, Torquay had a population of 18,534.

==History==
Torquay is situated on Wadawurrung country which is part of the Kulin nation that surrounds Port Phillip Bay.

From the 1860s, picnickers began to frequent the location, which was originally known as Spring Creek, after the watercourse along its south-western edge, but it was named Puebla in the 1882 Victorian Municipal Directory. James Follett, who settled there in 1871, came from Torquay, the seaside town in Devon, England, and at his suggestion the name Torquay was officially adopted in 1892. The Post Office opened on 20 August 1894. On 3 April 1908, the Spring Creek bridge was built, connecting the town to Anglesea.

In 1891, the Joseph H. Scammell sailing ship struck the reef near Point Danger in Torquay and subsequently became wedged on the reef and as a result the ship broke up in the heavy seas. The cargo of the Scammell was washed onto the beach of Torquay and was looted. The anchors of the Scammell are still on display at the Torquay front beach and the Torquay boat ramp.
In 1900, a primary school was opened in the newly built Presbyterian church, moving to the recreation hall in 1901, a permanent school building not opened until 1910. A bowling green, tennis courts and a golf course were opened by the 1920s. The town once had 145 bathing boxes on the main beach. In 1946, the Torquay Surf Life Saving Club was formed, opening their current clubrooms in 1971 after the previous one burnt down. Today, it is the oldest and largest club in Victoria.

Recent years have seen increased development of the area. With the &#x27;old town&#x27; between the highway and the beach almost fully developed, housing spread to Jan Juc, west of Spring Creek, in the 1970s, and new estates opened up to the north of the town after the 1980s. There was conflict between long-term residents and those behind some developments, in particular over the former Torquay Primary School site on Bristol and Boston Roads, which was sold by the government for luxury apartments and an expanded shopping centre, instead of being retained for community uses. In 2001, The Sands golf club and residential development commenced construction to the north west of the town on the site of the former Torquay Tip, which closed in the early 1990s. The resort opened in 2004.

The magazine &quot;History Matters&quot; produced by Torquay Museum Without Walls continues to document the history of Torquay.

==Climate==
Torquay has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), with warm-summer Mediterranean climate tendencies (Köppen climate classification: Csb). Summers are warm, though just barely with cool nights. Winters consist of cool days with chilly nights.

==Attractions==

The Torquay area is famous for its surf beaches, with Jan Juc and the world-famous Bells Beach located on the town&#x27;s south-west outskirts. Other popular beaches are Point Impossible Beach and Southside Beach. It was home to the popular Offshore Festival in the late 1990s. Many of the world&#x27;s most famous surf companies have their home in Torquay, including Rip Curl and Quiksilver- all of which make up part of the Surf Coast Plaza, which provides shopping and eating, as well as the Surf World Museum.

Torquay&#x27;s population usually triples between January and end of February, when the school holidays end; the town also hosts end of year Schoolies week celebrations, joint with Lorne, Victoria&#x27;s most active Schoolies destination.

The Australian National Surfing Museum is also located in Torquay.

Visitors can enjoy the stunning coastal views of Torquay from the sky with Torquay Skydivers, one of the most beautiful locations to skydive in Melbourne.

==Facilities==

Torquay&#x27;s local schools are Torquay College (primary school), St. Therese Catholic Primary School, Torquay Coast Primary School, Lisieux Catholic Primary School and Surf Coast Secondary College.

Torquay Primary School was once located in the &#x27;old town&#x27;, being moved across from St. Therese in October 2001. The same year a review on the provision of Secondary Schooling in Torquay was commenced, and in 2003 it was recommended that Torquay Primary School become a P-9 school (Torquay College) doing so in 2009, in 2012 it reverted to a standalone primary school.
The secondary years split from Torquay College in 2012 to form Surf Coast Secondary College which moved to a standalone campus in Torquay North at the start of 2014.

In October 2007, The new Torquay Police Station opened at the corner of the Surfcoast highway and central avenue. The new Police station was built at a cost of $7.8 million and is considered to be a state-of-the-art facility.

==Areas of Torquay==
===Frog Hollow===

Frog Hollow is in the north west of Torquay.

The estate has been developed on the site of a water catchment which has been drained.

===Ocean Views===
Ocean Views is in the south of Torquay.

The area was developed from 2000 when the first homes were built. It was originally a sheep and cattle grazing and farming area, known as &quot;Hard Man&#x27;s land&quot; because of its rocky and hilly landscape making it difficult to graze on.

It is now primarily residential, backing onto Spring Creek, where a proposed development with capacity for another 20,000 people was rejected in April 2009. It has a football oval and a golf club backing onto it.

The area has a V-line bus stop, the bus running to Warrnambool or to Geelong, three summer bus run stops, a post office box and a park, Spring Creek Play Park (locally known as Froggy Park). Walking access across the river to the football ground used to be difficult until in 2007 the shire built a footbridge connecting the reserve and the edge of the suburb, which is only around a 1.5 km radius. Ocean Views also have a BMX park.

The area is known for its high number of families.

===Wombah Park===
Wombah Park is in the north east of Torquay and is home to about 1000 residents.

<text>The culture of Ukraine is composed of the material and spiritual values of the Ukrainian people that has formed throughout the history of Ukraine. Strong family values and religion, alongside the traditions of Ukrainian embroidery and folk music are integral aspects of the country&#x27;s culture. It is closely intertwined with ethnic studies about ethnic Ukrainians and Ukrainian historiography which is focused on the history of Kyiv and the region around it.

==History==
Although the country has often struggled to preserve its independence its people have managed to retain their cultural possessions and are proud of the considerable cultural legacy they have created. Numerous writers have contributed to the country&#x27;s literary history such as Ivan Kotliarevsky, Taras Shevchenko and Ivan Franko. The Ukrainian culture has experienced a significant resurgence since the establishment of independence in 1991.

The earliest evidence of cultural artefacts in the Ukrainian lands can be traced to decorated mammoth tusks in the Neanderthal era. Later, the nomadic tribes of the southern lands of the 4th century BCE, like the Scythians, produced finely worked gold ornaments such as the pectoral found in the Tovsta Mohyla mound.

The modern Ukrainian culture is believed to be formed as a descendant of the ancient state of Kievan Rus&#x27; centered in Kyiv as well the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, both of which Ukrainians claim as their historical ancestors. Ukrainian historian, academic and politician of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, Mykhailo Hrushevsky referred to Ukraine as &quot;Ukraine-Rus,&quot; emphasising Ukraine&#x27;s historical claim to the ancient state of Kievan Rus.

Traditional peasant folk art, embroidery and vernacular architecture are critical to Ukrainian culture, and its elements have often been determined by the resources available at the time. The country&#x27;s strong tradition of folk art and embroidery continues to this day, with Ukrainian embroidery often considered an art form in itself.

Ukrainian customs are heavily influenced by the Ukrainian Greek Catholicism, Ruthenian Greek Catholicism and Eastern Orthodox Church and traditions from Slavic mythology. 
Prior to the Soviet Union, the Ukrainian culture has had heavy influence from other East Slavic cultures such as Russian and Belarusian culture.

Ukrainian culture has had to overcome numerous obstacles in order to survive and retain its originality, since foreign powers and empires who dominated the country and its people in the past often implemented policies aimed at assimilating the Ukrainian population into their own population, as well as trying to eradicate and purge elements of the culture. For example, the policy of Russification posed significant obstacles to the development of the culture.

Whilst progressing into modernity, Ukraine remains a highly traditional country, where the observance of certain customs and practices play a central role in its culture. Many significant Ukrainian holidays and events are based on the old Julian Calendar and so differ from their Gregorian counterparts. These include Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve, both of which are highly important in Ukrainian culture.

During the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, damage was caused to 1,945 cultural infrastructure objects, according to Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy. Cultural institutions that were damaged or destroyed by Russians include cultural clubs, libraries, museums, galleries, theatres, zoos, and art education institutions. It is estimated that rebuilding the damaged sites may take about 10 years.

==Customs==
===Holidays and celebrations ===
Social gatherings like Vechornytsi have a long history in Ukrainian culture, and so do traditional holidays like Ivan Kupala Night, Masliana (Masnytsia), Koliaduvannia, and Malanka, where people gather in large groups.

===Education===

===Religion===

Religion is practiced throughout the country. Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Eastern Catholicism and Roman Catholicism are the three most widely practiced religions. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church is the largest in the country. Faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the second largest, practice Byzantine rites, but are in communion with the Roman Catholic Church which means that they are also fully Catholic.

==Art==

===Architecture ===

Ukrainian architecture reflects distinct features of that particular location and time period. Design and architecture are influenced by the existing political and economic climate.

====Vernacular architecture====
Different regions in Ukraine have their own distinctive style of vernacular architecture, based on local traditions and the knowledge handed down through generations. The Museum of Folk Architecture and Way of Life of Central Naddnipryanshchyna is located in Pereiaslav. The open-air museum contains 13 theme museums, 122 examples of national architecture, and over 30,000 historical cultural objects. The Museum of Decorative Finishes is one of the featured museums that preserves the handiwork of decorative architectural applications in Ukrainian architecture. Decorative finishes use ancient traditional design patterns.

===Ornamental and visual art===
On special occasions, every aspect of ordinary life is transformed into ornamental art form of artistic expression. Ornamentation and design motifs are steeped in symbolism, religious ritual and meaning. From the illuminated manuscripts of the Peresopnytsia Gospel to the famous pysanky and vytynanky, intricate details have ancient meaning. Much of the oral history was lost during the past 300 years of Russification of Ukraine when Ukrainian culture and language were forbidden. Organizations like the Ivan Honchar Museum, Pysanka Museum and the Ukrainian Museum are dedicated to historic preservation. Different regions of Ukraine have their own traditional ornamentation with their own variation of style and meaning. Examples can be seen in Ukrainian painting (Petrykivka, Kosiv, Opishnia, Bubnivka), ornamental architecture, Ukrainian embroidery, and textile motifs from various Ukrainian historical regions. Some of these works are inscribed in UNESCO and National lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Ukraine.

====Jewelry====
====Painting====
====Traditional costume====
The iconic embroidered shirt or blouse, the vyshyvanka, is the most recognizable part of Ukrainian national costume, and even has its own public celebration in May. For men, traditional dress also includes kozhukh, kontusz, żupan and sharovary. For women, traditional dress includes kozhushanka, ochipok for married women, and Ukrainian wreath for unmarried girls. Garments are made using elaborate structural design, complicated weaving techniques, extensive embroidery, and cutwork needlework.

====Music====
====Theatre====

===Museums and libraries===

There are nearly 5,000 different museums in Ukraine, including National Art Museum of Ukraine, National Historical Museum of Ukraine, Museum of Western and Oriental Art, Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum in Kyiv, Lviv National Art Gallery, Poltava Art Museum, Simferopol Art Museum, and many others of art, history, traditions or dedicated to different issues. Many of these museums are at risk due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

There are 14 libraries of state significance (Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, National Parliamentary Library of Ukraine, National historical library of Ukraine in Kyiv, Korolenko State Scientific Library in Kharkiv, and others), and 45,000 public libraries all over Ukraine. All these institutions own 700 million books.

====Literature====
Ukrainian literature had a difficult development because, due to constant foreign domination over Ukrainian territories, there was often a significant difference between the spoken and written language. At times the use of the Ukrainian language was even partly prohibited to be printed. However, foreign rule by Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Turkey, left behind new words thereby enriching Ukrainian. Despite tsarist and Soviet repression, Ukrainian authors were able to produce a rich literary heritage.

Many Ukrainians also contributed to the closely related literature in Russian language.

==Popular culture==

=== Animation ===
===Cinema===
===Mass media===
===Sports===

Ukraine greatly benefitted from the Soviet emphasis on physical education, which left Ukraine with hundreds of stadiums, swimming pools, gymnasiums, and many other athletic facilities.

Football is the most popular sport in Ukraine. The top professional league is the Vyscha Liha, also known as the Ukrainian Premier League. The two most successful teams in the Vyscha Liha are rivals FC Dynamo Kyiv and FC Shakhtar Donetsk. Although Shakhtar is the reigning champion of the Vyscha Liha, Dynamo Kyiv has been much more successful historically, winning the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup two times, the UEFA Super Cup once, the USSR Championship a record 13 times, and the Ukrainian Championship a record 12 times; while Shakhtar only won four Ukrainian Championships and one and last UEFA Cup.

Many Ukrainians also played for the USSR national football team, most notably Igor Belanov and Oleg Blokhin, winners of the prestigious Golden Ball Award for the best footballers of the year. This award was only presented to one Ukrainian after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Andriy Shevchenko, the former captain of the Ukraine national football team. The national team made its debut in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and reached the quarter-finals before losing to eventual champions, Italy.

Ukrainian brothers Vitaliy Klychko and Volodymyr Klychko have held world heavyweight champion titles in boxing.

Ukraine made its debut at the 1994 Winter Olympics. So far, Ukraine has been much more successful in the Summer Olympics (96 medals in four appearances) than in the Winter Olympics (Five medals in four appearances). Ukraine is currently ranked 35th by the number of gold medals won in the All-time Olympic Games medal count, with every country above it, except for Russia, having more appearances.

Other popular sports in Ukraine include handball, tennis, rugby union, basketball, gymnastics, and ice hockey.

===Tourism===

Ukraine attracts more than 20 million visitors a year from around the world. Seven Natural Wonders of Ukraine and Seven Wonders of Ukraine are popular destinations as well as modern urban cities, festivals, ecotourism, and medical tourism.

== Crimean Tatars ==
Crimean Tatars are the indigenous people of the Crimea.

Yurts or nomadic tents have traditionally played an important role in the cultural history of Crimean Tatars. There are different types of yurts; some are large and collapsible, called &quot;terme&quot;, while others are small and non-collapsible (otav).

On the Nowruz holiday, Crimean Tatars usually cook eggs, chicken soup, puff meat pie (kobete), halva, and sweet biscuits. Children put on masks and sing special songs under the windows of their neighbours, receiving sweets in return.

The songs (makam) of the nomadic steppe Crimean Tatars are characterized by diatonic, melodic simplicity and brevity. The songs of mountainous and southern coastal Crimean Tatars, called , are sung with richly ornamented melodies. Household lyricism is also widespread. Occasionally, song competitions take place between young men and women during Crimean holidays and weddings. Ritual folklore includes winter greetings, wedding songs, lamentations and circular dance songs (khoran). Epic stories or destans are very popular among the Crimean Tatars, particularly the destans of &quot;Chora batyr&quot;, &quot;Edige&quot;, &quot;Koroglu&quot; and others.

Today in use there are two types of alphabet: Cyrillic and Latin. Initially Crimean Tatars used Arabic script. In 1928 it was replaced with the Latin alphabet. Cyrillic was introduced in 1938 based on the Russian alphabet. The Cyrillic alphabet was the only official one between 1938 and 1997. All its letters coincide with those of the Russian alphabet. The 1990s saw the start of the gradual transition of the language to the new Latin alphabet based on the Turkish one.

=== Music ===
Singer-songwriter Jamala won the Eurovision contest in 2016. She sings jazz, soul, funk, folk, pop and electro, and is also the author of most of her songs.

<text>Denny&#x27;s Corporation (also known as Denny&#x27;s Diner on some locations&#x27; signage) is an American diner-style restaurant chain. It operates over 1,700 restaurants in many countries.

==Description==
Originally opened as a coffee shop under the name Danny&#x27;s Donuts in Lakewood, California, Denny&#x27;s was known for always being open and serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner 24 hours a day. Denny&#x27;s did not close on holidays and nights, except where required by law. Many restaurants are located near freeway exits, bars, and in-service areas.

Denny&#x27;s started franchising in 1963, and most Denny&#x27;s restaurants are now franchisee-owned. Franchise agreements require 24/7 service in most locations. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant industry in the United States, many Denny&#x27;s had to close for the first time and may now have limited hours of operation.

==History==

Denny&#x27;s was founded by Harold Butler and Richard Jezak in 1953, who opened Danny&#x27;s Donuts in Lakewood, California, in 1954. In 1956, a year after Jezak departed from the six-store chain, Butler changed the concept, shifting it from a donut shop to a coffee shop with store No. 8. Danny&#x27;s Donuts was renamed Danny&#x27;s Coffee Shops and changed its operation to 24 hours. During the 1950s, Los Angeles architects Armet &amp; Davis created a new prototype building with a boomerang-shaped roof that became a model for stores built nationwide. They also designed a second prototype in 1965 with a zigzag shingled roof. These designs enabled Googie architecture to spread across America. Many Denny&#x27;s locations were built near freeway offramps, leading to increasingly larger signage. In 1959, Butler changed the name from Danny&#x27;s Coffee Shops to avoid confusion with the Los Angeles restaurant chain Coffee Dan&#x27;s to Denny&#x27;s Coffee Shops. In 1961, Denny&#x27;s Coffee Shops was renamed Denny&#x27;s. The business continued to expand, and by 1981, there were over 1,000 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states. The company absorbed many of the old Sambo&#x27;s restaurants and used their mid-century design in some of their restaurants. In 1977, Denny&#x27;s introduced the still-popular Grand Slam breakfast. In 1994, Denny&#x27;s became the largest corporate sponsor of Save the Children, a national charity. All but six Denny&#x27;s closed for the first time ever on Christmas 1988; many restaurants were built without locks, and some had reportedly lost their keys.

Denny&#x27;s main offices were in La Mirada, California, until 1989. At that time, the office was first moved to Irvine, California, and subsequently moved to the Spartanburg, South Carolina headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation (TW Corporation) that acquired Denny&#x27;s in 1987. In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses. On July 12, 1997, Flagstar, Denny&#x27;s parent company, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eventually, Denny&#x27;s operations dominated the parent company to such an extent that The Flagstar Companies changed its name again to Denny&#x27;s Corporation. It trades on the NASDAQ under the DENN symbol.

From 1990 through 1996, Denny&#x27;s offered a free meal to anyone on their birthday. The offer included limited meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotion began in the 1990s, though occasionally, individual franchises had offered it before that time. Because too many people went to Denny&#x27;s more than once on their birthdays, the management had to restrict the rules to only one meal per person, per birthday, only on the actual birthday, with proof of legal birth date required, such as a driver&#x27;s license, other photo ID, or a birth certificate. Since 2009, the restaurant chain has offered a free Birthday Build-Your-Own Slam on the customer&#x27;s birthday.

In 1994, Denny&#x27;s began renovating its stores with a lighter color scheme; select locations also began serving Baskin-Robbins ice cream for a short time. Houston, Texas, was the test market for the chain-wide renovation.

Denny&#x27;s opened its first restaurant in Australia in December 1982, in the suburb of Forest Hill, Melbourne. The Australian franchise was owned by Ansett Australia and expanded into other states throughout the 1980s. However, changing tastes of the Australian consumer led to the sale of the chain in 1989 and its closure shortly after that.

===Denny&#x27;s Diner prototype===

Some Denny&#x27;s restaurants employ the &quot;diner&quot; concept, using modular buildings resembling classic 1950s diners. In May 1997, the first Denny&#x27;s Classic Diner was opened in Fort Myers, Florida. The diner concept was created by Ron, Marcia, Marc, and Todd York, the principals of Denny&#x27;s Franchisee SWFRI, Inc. Today, there are about 40 Denny&#x27;s Diners in the United States. Additionally, several diners resemble modular buildings but are actually stick construction.

===Domestic and international growth===
In July 2010, Denny&#x27;s presence in the United States saw a major expansion when Pilot Flying J started opening Denny&#x27;s locations inside their Flying J-branded truck stop locations. 123 Pilot Flying J conversions were eventually completed.

In June 2012, Denny&#x27;s opened a location in the Las Américas International Airport, its first location in an airport and its first in the Dominican Republic. In July 2012, Denny&#x27;s announced it had signed an agreement with a franchisee to open 50 restaurants in southern China over 15 years, beginning in 2013. This makes it Denny&#x27;s largest international development deal at that time. However the deal was cancelled before any restaurants opened.

On August 29, 2014, Denny&#x27;s opened its first location in New York City, with some patrons waiting as long as two hours before its official opening to eat there. Located in Lower Manhattan, the location is designed to be more upscale than the typical Denny&#x27;s, serves alcohol, and offers a location-exclusive $300 Grand Cru Slam, which is the standard Grand Slam Breakfast served with a bottle of Dom Pérignon. It closed in January 2018.

In November 2017, it was announced that Denny&#x27;s was to open its first UK restaurant in Swansea in December 2017 as part of Parc Tawe&#x27;s 15 million redevelopment scheme, occupying a 4,000 sq ft unit. The restaurant opened on Christmas Day 2017 for the homeless people in the city of Swansea, although the official opening to the general public was on December 27.

In 2022, Denny&#x27;s acquired Orlando-based chain Keke&#x27;s Breakfast Cafe for $82.5 million. During an October 22, 2024, investor day, Denny&#x27;s announced it would expand Keke&#x27;s nationwide while closing 150 Denny’s restaurants in the following 12–18 months.

At the end of 2023 there were 1,602 Denny&#x27;s restaurants. With the company owning and operating 66 with the remaining 1,582 under a franchising model; 1,445 of Denny&#x27;s 1,602 restaurants are located in the United States (including the District of Columbia), 84 in Canada, 15 in Mexico, 15 in Puerto Rico, 12 in Philippines, 7 in New Zealand, 6 in Honduras, 5 in the UAE, 2 in Guatemala, 3 in Costa Rica, 2 in Guam, 3 in El Salvador, 1 in Indonesia, 1 in Curaçao and 1 in the United Kingdom. Denny&#x27;s previously had a location in Chile. The U.S. states with the most Denny&#x27;s restaurants are California (363), Texas (204) and Florida (124).

There are also about 578 Denny&#x27;s restaurants in Japan operated independently under a license by a subsidiary of Seven &amp; I Holdings since 1984.
The first Denny&#x27;s restaurant in Japan opened on the first floor of the Ito-Yokado in Kamiōoka (:ja:上大岡), Kōnan-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture on April 27, 1974, however, it closed on March 20, 2017, on account of the demolition of the building of Ito-Yokado. See also :ja:デニーズ (日本).

== Health inspection records ==
In October 2004, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; aired a segment titled &quot;Dirty Dining&quot;, in which the ten most popular family and casual dining chains in the United States were examined: Applebee&#x27;s, Bob Evans, Chili&#x27;s, Denny&#x27;s, IHOP, Outback Steakhouse, Red Lobster, Ruby Tuesday, TGI Friday&#x27;s, and Waffle House. As part of the segment, the producers examined the health inspection records for 100 restaurants over 15 months and totaled all of the critical violations that could result in adverse effects on the customers&#x27; health. Denny&#x27;s had the fewest violations, averaging fewer than one violation per restaurant. Denny&#x27;s attributes this relative success to its adherence to the principles of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points.

==Animal welfare efforts==
Denny&#x27;s had worked with the Humane Society of the United States to address animal welfare issues. In 2008, Denny&#x27;s began switching to cage-free eggs.

In 2012, the company announced it would work with its suppliers to avoid keeping pigs in gestation crates. However, the company removed its initial commitment and is now facing a public awareness campaign (itsdinertime.com). In 2024, the Humane Society of the United States filed a shareholder proposal requesting that the company reinstate its deadline to eliminate gestation crates from its supply chain.

==Controversies==
===Discrimination===
Denny&#x27;s has been involved in discrimination lawsuits involving food servers denying or providing inferior service to racial minorities, especially black customers.

A 1993 incident occurred when six black United States Secret Service agents visited a Denny&#x27;s restaurant in Annapolis, Maryland. They were forced to wait an hour for service while their white companions were seated immediately.

In San Jose, California, in 1991, several black teenagers were refused service unless they agreed to pay in advance.

In 1994, Denny&#x27;s settled a class action lawsuit filed by black customers who had been refused service, forced to wait longer, or pay more than white customers. The $54.4 million settlement was the largest under federal public accommodations laws established thirty years earlier.

In 1995, a black Denny&#x27;s customer in Sacramento, California, was told that he and his friends had to pay upfront at the counter upon ordering their meals. He questioned the waitress: &quot;We asked the waitress about it and she said that some black guys who had been in the restaurant earlier had made a scene and walked out without paying their bill. So the manager now wanted all blacks to pay up front.&quot;

In 1997, six Asian-American students from Syracuse University visited a local Denny&#x27;s restaurant late at night. They waited more than half an hour as white patrons were regularly served, seated, and offered more helpings. They complained to management and their server but were forced to leave the establishment by two security guards called by Denny&#x27;s management. Then, according to the students, a group of white men came out of Denny&#x27;s, attacked them and shouted racial epithets. Several of the students were beaten unconscious.

After the $54.4 million settlement, Denny&#x27;s created a racial sensitivity training program for all employees. Denny&#x27;s has also made efforts at improving its public relations image by featuring African-Americans in their commercials, including one featuring Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford, actors from the popular &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; television series. In 2001, Denny&#x27;s was chosen by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine as the &quot;Best Company for Minorities.&quot; In 2006 and 2007, Denny&#x27;s topped &quot;Black Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Best 40 Companies for Diversity.&quot;

In 2014, a Denny&#x27;s location in Deming, New Mexico, was subjected to a discrimination claim by an LGBT group, alleging that wait staff used homophobic slurs and refused to serve a group of gay, lesbian, and transgender customers who were attending a gay pride celebration. One year later, Denny&#x27;s agreed to donate $13,000 to Deming Pride, pay $3,250 to a female customer who was subjected to abusive behavior by wait staff, and retrain its employees about discrimination policies.

In 2017, the staff at a Denny&#x27;s in Vancouver, British Columbia, was accused of making an Indigenous woman pay for her meal before it was served. After the customer left, restaurant staff called police to report the incident, alleging that the patron had a sharp metal object in her pocket.

=== Animal cruelty allegations ===
In 2023, the global animal rights group Animal Equality began a public information campaign regarding Denny&#x27;s failure to eliminate gestation crates for pigs from its supply chain.

===Sudden closures===
In June 2017, eight Denny&#x27;s locations in Colorado, including Colorado Springs and Pueblo, abruptly shut down due to a franchise owner failing to pay nearly $200,000 in back taxes as well as over $30,000 in sales tax from the previous year. In addition, several employees claimed there were issues with accounts not being paid, bounced checks, and paychecks not arriving on time. As a result of the seizure of the eight Denny&#x27;s locations by the IRS, numerous employees were left without employment and claimed that no advance warning was given regarding the sudden closures. The franchise owner responsible for the closures immediately fled the state of Colorado.

On January 31, 2024, a Denny&#x27;s location in Oakland, California, permanently closed after 54 years of operation, citing the &quot;safety and well-being&quot; of customers and employees.

===Ghost kitchens===

With the advent of delivery services such as Grubhub, DoorDash and Uber Eats, Denny&#x27;s has begun operating many of their own Ghost kitchens, such as &quot;The Meltdown&quot; a late-night melt &quot;virtual brand.&quot; &quot;The Meltdown&quot; serves Denny&#x27;s menu items at an up-charge. Where the &quot;Brisket Melt&quot; is $16.69, &quot;The Meltdown&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Giddy Up Melt,&quot; was $18.72 in 2024, despite being the same sandwiches. Ghost kitchens have been described as a cynical ploy by big-brand restaurants to garner a new younger consumer base.

<doc id="690297" wikidata="Q311766" url="?curid=690297" title="Philippe de Vitry">
<text>Philippe de Vitry (31 October 12919 June 1361) was a French composer-poet, bishop and music theorist in the style of late medieval music. An accomplished, innovative, and influential composer, he was widely acknowledged as a leading musician of his day; the early Renaissance scholar Petrarch wrote a glowing tribute, calling him: &quot;... the keenest and most ardent seeker of truth, so great a philosopher of our age.&quot; The important music treatise &quot;Ars nova notandi&quot; (1322) is usually attributed to Vitry.

It is thought that few of Vitry&#x27;s compositions survive; though he wrote secular music, only his sacred works are extant.

==Life and career==
Details of Philippe de Vitry&#x27;s early life are vague. While some medieval sources claim that he was born in the Champagne region, modern researchers have found that he may have originated from Vitry-en-Artois near Arras.

Given that he is often referred to in documents as a Magister, Vitry is thought likely to have studied at the University of Paris. Later he was prominent in the courts of Charles IV, Philippe VI and Jean II, serving as a secretary and advisor. Perhaps aided by these Bourbon connections, he also held several canonries, including Clermont, Beauvais and Paris, also serving for a time in the papal retinue at Avignon starting with Clement VI. In addition to all this, he was a diplomat and a soldier, known to have served at the siege of Aiguillon in 1346.

In 1351 Vitry became Bishop of Meaux, east of Paris. Moving in all the most important political, artistic and ecclesiastical circles, he was acquainted with many lights of the age, including the Italian scholar Petrarch and the mathematician, philosopher and music theorist Nicole Oresme. Vitry died in Paris on 9 June 1361.

==Music==

Manuscript of Vitry&#x27;s &quot;Aman novi/Heu Fortuna/Heu me, tristis est anima mea&quot; from F-Pnm Français 146, a version of the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;.

Vitry is most famous in music history for the treatise on music &quot;Ars nova notandi&quot; (1322), that lent its name to the music of the era. His authorship—and the very existence of—the treatise have come into question.

A few of Vitry&#x27;s compositions have survived. They show the innovations in musical notation, particularly mensural and rhythmic, with which he was credited within a century of their inception. Such innovations as are exemplified in his stylistically-attributed motets for the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot; were particularly important; they made possible the free and complex music of the next 100 years, which culminated in the Ars subtilior.

Vitry is reputed to have written chansons, but only some of his motets have survived. Each is strikingly individual, exploiting a unique structural idea. He is also often credited with developing the concept of isorhythmic lines. Five of his three-part motets have survived in the &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;; an additional nine can be found in the Ivrea Codex.

==Works==
While there is still debate about what Vitry did and did not compose, the first 16 works here, all motets, are widely considered to be his. Few of Vitry&#x27;s compositions survive. He wrote secular music, but only his sacred works are extant.

;Attributed on strong historical evidence

# Aman novi / Heu Fortuna / Heu me, tristis est anima mea
# Cum statua / Hugo / Magister invidie
# Douce playsence / Garison / Neuma quinti toni
# Floret / Florens / Neuma

&quot;Note:&quot; The motet &quot;Phi millies / O creator / Iacet granum / Quam sufflabit&quot; and the ballade &quot;De terre en grec Gaulle appellee&quot; are securely attributed to Vitry, but no music for the latter survives, whilst the former survives only fragmentarily (see Zayaruznaya, 2018).

<doc id="690299" wikidata="Q5442941" url="?curid=690299" title="Femslash">
<text>Femslash (also known as &quot;f/f slash&quot;, &quot;f/f&quot;, &quot;femmeslash&quot;, &quot;altfic&quot; and &quot;sapphic&quot;) is a genre which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters.

== Characteristics ==
Typically, characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canon universe; however, similar fan fiction about lesbian or bisexual female characters is commonly labeled as femslash for convenience. The term is generally applied only to fanworks based on Western fandoms; the nearest anime/manga equivalents are more often called yuri and shōjo-ai fanfiction. &quot;Saffic&quot; is a portmanteau of Sapphic from the term Sapphic love and fiction. &quot;Altfic&quot; as a term for fanfiction about loving relationships between women was popularized by Xena fans.

There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples; for example, in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; fandom, only a small number of femslash stories are written about the Arwen/Éowyn pairing in comparison to slash between the male characters. It has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash, and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters. Janeway/Seven is the main &quot;Star Trek&quot; femslash pairing, as only they have &quot;an on-screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict&quot;. Although it is debated whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; counts as &quot;slash&quot;, their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline. It is &quot;relatively recently&quot; that male writers have begun writing femslash, and this entry of males into femslash has occurred within &quot;Buffy&quot; femslash. The femslash authorship is mostly female. As of 2008, femslash was enjoying increasing popularity and was the &quot;dominant form&quot; of slash in some fandoms.

== History ==
Femslash was relatively rare in fanfiction communities until the 1990s. The show served as one of the first major femslash fandoms, with the relationship Xena/Gabrielle, and also served as one of the first major fandoms where alternative universe fics were widely written.

The television show &quot;The L Word&quot; set up a contest at the website FanLib.com where fans could submit a femme slash fanfic. The winner&#x27;s story was incorporated into a scene of a third-season episode.

For more recent TV series, femslash fans have focused on shows with significant platonic female relationships such as &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, or with canonical queer women in &quot;Orange Is the New Black&quot; and &quot;The 100&quot;.

<doc id="690315" wikidata="Q839227" url="?curid=690315" title="U.S. Route 141">
<text>US Highway 141 (US 141) is a north–south United States Numbered Highway in the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. The highway runs north-northwesterly from an interchange with Interstate 43 (I-43) in Bellevue, Wisconsin, near Green Bay, to a junction with US 41/M-28 near Covington, Michigan. In between, it follows city streets in Green Bay and has a concurrent section with US 41 in Wisconsin. North of Green Bay, US 141 is either a freeway or an expressway into rural northern Wisconsin before downgrading to an undivided highway. In Michigan, US 141 is an undivided highway that runs through rural woodlands. The highway has two segments in each state; after running through Wisconsin for about , it crosses into Michigan for approximately another . After that, it crosses back into Wisconsin for about before crossing the state line one last time. The northernmost Michigan section is about , making the overall length about .

When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US 141 ran from Milwaukee to Green Bay, and one segment of the modern highway in Michigan was originally designated US Highway 102 (US 102). This other designation was decommissioned in 1928 when US 141 was extended north from Green Bay into Michigan. Michigan has rebuilt the highway in stages over the years to smooth out sharp curves in the routing. Since the 1960s, the section south of Green Bay has been converted into a freeway in segments. US 141 has ended southeast of Green Bay in Bellevue since the 1980s—the southern freeway segment was redesignated as I-43. The section north of Abrams, Wisconsin, was converted to a freeway in the opening years of the 21st century, with an additional divided-highway section opening a few years later.

==Route description==
As a bi-state highway, US 141 is a state trunk highway in Wisconsin and a state trunkline highway in Michigan. In Wisconsin, the segment through the Green Bay area is not on the National Highway System (NHS), except for about four blocks along Broadway Avenue that is part of an intermodal connector with the Port of Green Bay. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. From the Green Bay suburb of Howard northward, including the entire length through Michigan, US 141 is a part of the NHS. From the I-43 interchange in Howard north to the split at Abrams, US 141 is also a part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT), a tourist route that surrounds Lake Michigan.

===Green Bay to Niagara===

US 141 starts at an interchange with I-43 southeast of Green Bay in the suburb of Bellevue. From the terminus at exit 178, US 141 runs north to Main Street, and then northwesterly along Main Street through town. Wisconsin Highway 29 (WIS 29) merges with US 141 at an intersection on the northwest side of Bellevue, and the two highways run concurrently through residential subdivisions. Main Street passes over I-43 and continues to the north and into the city of Green Bay. US 141/WIS 29 crosses Baird Creek and runs along the banks of the East River. At the intersection with Monroe Avenue, WIS 29 turns south, joining WIS 54/WIS 57 while US 141 continues westward on Main Street to cross the Fox River on the Ray Nitschke Memorial Bridge. On the west side of the river, the highway follows Dousman Street for a block before turning north along Broadway Avenue for four blocks. From there, the highway follows Mather Street west to Velp Avenue. US 141 follows that street northwesterly and parallel to I-43 on the north side of Green Bay. This area is mostly residential with some businesses immediately on either side. In the suburb of Howard, US 141 merges onto the I-41/US 41 freeway via the interchange at exit 170. I-41/US 41/US 141 has an interchange for I-43 just south of the Duck Creek crossing, where I-41 terminates.

From Howard northward, the freeway runs through suburban Brown County to Suamico, parallel to a line of the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad (ELS), through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. There are frontage roads on both sides of the freeway to provide access to the properties immediately adjacent to US 41/US 141. There are a number of interchanges with county-maintained roads between Suamico and Abrams in Oconto County. At Abrams, US 141 splits from US 41 and heads northward as an expressway while the latter freeway turns northeasterly. The landscape north of the split transitions to forest, and the freeway crosses the Oconto River in Stiles south of the interchange with WIS 22. The expressway bypasses Lena to the east. It crosses a railroad track at the surface and continues north through mixed farm fields and forest to the county line. North of the line, US 141 continues to the Marinette County communities of Coleman and Pound as an expressway. There is another grade railroad crossing at Pound. Through Coleman and Pound there is also a Business US 141. Past the latter town, US 141 transitions from expressway to a two-lane undivided highway.
South of Crivitz, US 141 crosses the Peshtigo River. The highway crosses a branch line of the ELS on the east side of Crivitz and continues north through woodland to the community of Middle Inlet. North of town, the roadway turns northeasterly to the community of Wausaukee where it intersects WIS 180. From there, the highway passes through the communities of Amberg and Beecher before coming into Pembine, where US 8 merges in from the west. The two highways run concurrently north and northeasterly to an intersection southeast of Niagara. US 8 separates to the east, and US 141 turns northwesterly along River Street into Niagara. The highway then turns north along Roosevelt Road and over the Menominee River to exit the state of Wisconsin.

===Quinnesec northward===
Once in Michigan, west of Quinnesec, US 141 meets and joins US 2. The two highways run concurrently westward into Iron Mountain along Stephenson Avenue, passing through a retail business corridor and into downtown. M-95 joins the two highways, and all three pass Lake Antoine. M-95 turns off north of town and US 2/US 141 crosses the Menominee River back into Wisconsin.

US 2/US 141 makes a run through Florence County, passing the Spread Eagle Chain of Lakes. The highway serves the communities of Spread Eagle and Florence. The only junction with another state trunk highway in Wisconsin on the northern section is with the concurrent highways WIS 70/WIS 101 in Florence. The highway crosses back into Michigan on a bridge over the Brule River south of Crystal Falls.
Across the state line, the trunkline runs through forest near several smaller bodies of water such as Stager, Kennedy, and Railroad lakes. The highway enters Crystal Falls on 5th Street. US 2/US 141 runs along the top of the hill in town and intersects the western terminus of M-69 next to the Iron County Courthouse. US 141 continues westward on Crystal Avenue and separates from the US 2 concurrency on the western edge of town. Running north and northwesterly, US 141 passes to the east of the Ottawa National Forest through rural Iron County. The highway crosses the Paint River and continues through forest to the community of Amasa. The trunkline crosses the Hemlock River on the west side of town. From there, US 141 runs northward into the southwest corner of Baraga County and also enters the Eastern Time Zone. West of Worm Lake, US 141 meets M-28 in the community of Covington. The two highways merge and run easterly for about before US 141 terminates at US 41; M-28 continues eastward, merging with US 41.

==History==

===Initial state highways===
In 1918, when Wisconsin initially numbered its highway system, the route of what later became US 141 followed two separate state highways: WIS 17 from downtown Milwaukee to Manitowoc and WIS 16 from Manitowoc north to Green Bay. Segments that later became US 141 in Wisconsin were numbered WIS 15 between Green Bay and Abrams, and WIS 38 between Abrams and Wausaukee. North of Wausaukee, the future US Highway was an unnumbered secondary highway. In 1919, Michigan signed its highway system, but the state did not have a highway running south from Quinnesec to the state line. The highway from Quinnesec into Iron Mountain was part of M-12. The segment through Florence County, Wisconsin, was WIS 69, and from the Crystal Falls area north to Covington, the M-69 moniker was used. In 1919, the WIS 38 designation was extended northward to Niagara and the state line. The highway was straightened to eliminate a series of sharp curves between Crivitz and Beaver in 1921. The same year, WIS 17 was realigned between Sheboygan and Cedar Grove to run via Oostburg. WIS 17 was also realigned in 1922 to follow a separate routing south of Port Washington; previously it was routed concurrently with WIS 57 in the area. By 1924, maps showed an unnumbered roadway running south from Quinnesec to connect with WIS 57 at the state line.

===Conversion to a US Highway===
As originally proposed in 1925, several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula were to be designated. However, the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 than on the final 1926 map. In the original plan, US 102 was supposed to replace M-15 from US 2 at Rapid River, continue via Marquette to Humboldt, and the highway between Crystal Falls and Covington was not included in the system. However, when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11, 1926, US 41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette, and US 102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington. In both plans, US 141 was only routed between Milwaukee and Green Bay, replacing WIS 17 and WIS 16. At the time the two US Highways were created, WIS 57 was left untouched between Abrams and Niagara. The next year, the M-57 designation was assigned to connect WIS 57 to Quinnesec, and US 8 was extended to follow US 141 to US 2 near Iron Mountain.

On November 12, 1928, the extension of US 141 northward from Green Bay along WIS 57 to the Michigan state line had been approved; the signage was readied for installation the previous month. The US 102 designation was decommissioned when US 141 was also extended to replace M-57 from the state line, along US 2 to Crystal Falls and north to Covington. US 8&#x27;s eastern end was rerouted along a separate bridge over the Menominee River to a new terminus at an intersection with US 2 in Norway in 1929. US 141 was fully paved in Wisconsin in the early 1930s; the last segment to be completed was between Pound and Abrams.

The next major changes were made at the beginning of the 1930s in Michigan. A realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the Menominee River between 1932 and 1934. In 1940, a new routing from the state line north to Crystal Falls was opened; the previous routing was returned to local control. The northern end was relocated near Covington in late 1948 or early 1949 when US 41 was realigned in the area. This terminus was shifted again when US 141/M-28 was realigned in the area in late 1955 or early 1956.

===Freeway era===

At about the same time as the realignments in Michigan, two-lane bypasses of Manitowoc and Port Washington in Wisconsin were opened in 1957. The state built a divided-highway segment that opened the following year running from the Milwaukee area northward to the Ozaukee–Milwaukee county line. The highway was rerouted to run further inland, bypassing Haven, Wisconsin, in 1959. In late 1961, the highway in Michigan was rebuilt in northern Iron and southern Baraga counties between Amasa and Covington as the state smoothed out sharp corners in the routing and finished paving US 141; a similar project was completed in 1972 south of Amasa to Crystal Falls.

Wisconsin proposed an addition to the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state&#x27;s third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US 41 or US 141 corridors, or a new corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US 141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway. The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road. The following year, an extension of the freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue. By 1965, the bypass of Sheboygan was opened; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year. Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to Grafton in Ozaukee County. The last section of US 141 in the city of Milwaukee to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when I-94 was finished through downtown; at the same time, US 141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.
Another freeway section from north of Green Bay to Suamico was opened in 1971. In 1972, the divided-highway segment between Suamico and Abrams opened, and the state started the construction of additional freeways between Green Bay and Milwaukee. The bypasses of Sheboygan and Cedar Grove were converted to full freeways in 1973. Another segment of freeway opened in 1975 that bypassed Port Washington and connected the freeway sections that ended near Grafton and Cedar Grove. I-43 was first designated on the 1978 official state highway map along US 141 from Milwaukee to Sheboygan; missing segments of I-43 between Green Bay and Milwaukee are shown as either under construction or proposed. In November of that year, the section bypassing Maribel opened. In October 1980, the segment of freeway between Sheboygan and Denmark opened. At the same time, the northern bypass of Green Bay was under construction and I-43/US 141 was open from Maribel to Branch northwest of Manitowoc; US 141 was truncated to end at the northern end of the Sheboygan bypass. I-43 was initially completed in 1981, and the southern terminus of US 141 was moved again, truncating the highway to end in Bellevue by 1983.

In 1986, the states in the Great Lakes region created the LMCT as part of a larger program of tourist routes in the region; US 141 carries the LMCT between the northern I-43 junction in the Green Bay area north to the split with US 41 at Abrams. In the first years of the 21st century, US 141 was expanded to a four-lane expressway northward from Abrams to Oconto Falls. A further upgrade in 2006 expanded the highway to four-lanes northward to Beaver. On April 7, 2015, the segment of US 141 that runs concurrently with US 41 on the west side of Green Bay was designated a part of I-41 by the Federal Highway Administration.

==Major intersections==












==Business routes==
Three business routes of US 141 have existed. Two of these routes have been decommissioned.
===Coleman–Pound===
Business U.S. Highway 141 (Bus. US 141) is a business loop of US 141 that runs through the communities of Coleman and Pound. The loop follows County Trunk Highway B (CTH-B) northeasterly from the US 141 expressway into downtown Coleman and then turns northward near Coleman High School. Bus. US 141 continues northward into Pound, crossing the Peshtigo River in between the two communities. North of Pound, the loop crosses over US 141 on 21st Road and continues to an intersection with WIS 64. The business loop follows WIS 64 back to an interchange on US 141 northwest of Pound where the loop terminates.

In 2006, the US 141 expressway was extended northward near Beaver, and the former route of US 141, plus a connector roadway southwest of downtown Coleman was designated as a business loop. This route does not appear on the official Wisconsin Department of Transportation maps, so it is a locally designated business loop under local maintenance.
===Manitowoc===

Business U.S. Highway 141 (Bus. US 141) was a business loop of US 141 that was signed along US 151 and US 10 through downtown Manitowoc. The route was created in 1975, and decommissioned in 1980.

===Sheboygan===

Business U.S. Highway 141 (Bus. US 141) was a business loop of US 141 that served downtown Sheboygan. The route was created when an expressway bypass of Sheboygan was finished in the early 1970s, and replaced with a business loop of WIS 42 when I-43 was finished and US 141 was truncated in 1980.&#x27;

<text>The states and federal territories of Malaysia are the primary administrative divisions of the country. Malaysia comprises a federation of 13 states (Negeri) and 3 federal territories (Wilayah Persekutuan).

==States and federal territories==
Eleven states and two federal territories are located on the Malay Peninsula, collectively called &quot;Peninsular Malaysia&quot; (&quot;Semenanjung Malaysia&quot;) or &quot;West Malaysia&quot;. Two states are on the island of Borneo, and the remaining federal territory consists of islands offshore of Borneo; they are collectively referred to as &quot;East Malaysia&quot; or Malaysian Borneo. Out of the 13 states in Malaysia, 9 are monarchies.

===States===
===Federal Territories===

==Governance==
The governance of the states is divided between the federal government and the state governments, while the federal territories are directly administered by the federal government. The specific responsibilities of the federal and the state governments are listed in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution of Malaysia. Theoretically, any matter not set out in the Ninth Schedule can be legislated on by the individual states. However, legal scholars generally view this as a &quot;pauper&#x27;s bequest&quot; because of the large scope of the matters listed in the Ninth Schedule. The courts themselves have generally favoured a broad interpretation of the language of the Ninth Schedule, thus limiting the number of possible subjects not covered. The Ninth Schedule specifically lists the following matters as those that can only be legislated on by the states: land tenure, the Islamic religion, and local government.

Nine of the peninsular states, based on historical Malay kingdoms, are known as the Malay states. Each Malay state has a hereditary ruler as titular head of state and an executive Chief Minister or &quot;Menteri Besar&quot; as politically responsible head of government. The rulers of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Pahang, Perak, Selangor and Terengganu are styled Sultans. Negeri Sembilan&#x27;s elective ruler holds the title of &quot;Yamtuan Besar&quot;, whereas the ruler of Perlis is titled &quot;Raja&quot;. The federal head of state, the &quot;Yang di-Pertuan Agong&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;King&quot; in English), is elected (de facto rotated) among the nine rulers to serve a 5-year term. Former British settlements and crown colonies of Penang and Malacca (both peninsular), and Sabah and Sarawak (both on Borneo) each have a titular Governor (styled &quot;Yang di-Pertua Negeri&quot;) appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and an executive Chief Minister or &quot;Ketua Menteri&quot;. except for Sarawak whose head of government is styled &#x27;Premier&#x27;.

While the population of Malaysia is ethnically and religiously diverse, such diversity is spread throughout the country and not inherently reflected by the borders of the states. There is a significant distinction however between the peninsular states and the two states of East Malaysia, Sabah and Sarawak, which have significant indigenous populations. Both states have greater autonomy that those on the peninsula, including additional powers over their immigration controls as part of the 20-point agreement and 18-point agreement drawn up by the respective states when they, together with the Federation of Malaya and Singapore, formed Malaysia. They have separate immigration policies and controls and a unique residency status. Passports are required even for Peninsular Malaysians for travelling between either state and Peninsular Malaysia, or between the two states, however those who are on social/business visits up to three months are allowed to produce a MyKad or birth certificate and obtain a special printout form in lieu of a passport. 

Each state has a unicameral legislature called &quot;Dewan Undangan Negeri&quot; (&quot;DUN&quot;, State Assembly). Members of DUN are elected from single-member constituencies drawn based on population. The state leader of the majority party in DUN is usually appointed Chief Minister by the Ruler or Governor. The term of DUN members is five years unless the assembly is dissolved earlier by the Ruler or Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. Usually, DUN of the states in Peninsular Malaysia are dissolved in conjunction with the dissolution of the federal parliament, to have state elections running concurrently with the parliamentary election. However, Rulers and Governors hold discretionary powers in withholding consent to dissolve the DUN. Each state sends two senators elected by the DUN to the &quot;Dewan Negara&quot; (Senate), the upper house of the federal parliament.

In some states, especially smaller ones, state government composition is influenced by the composition of the national government. This may help secure funding for the state. Historically, most state governments were led by UMNO (Penang and Selangor were historical outliers without UMNO governments), and opposed by a member of a major opposition alliance such as Pakatan Harapan (PH). Following the 2018 Malaysian general election, state governments saw a period of shifting coalitions and much more complex party politics. After the 2022 Malaysian general election formed a national coalition form between UMNO and Pakatan Harapan, most state governments led by those alliances brought the other into government. In Johor, the concept of an official opposition was replaced by the idea of a &quot;balancing force&quot;, and the PH-affiliated former opposition adopted this role instead of joining the UMNO government. In Terengganu, the Perikatan Nasional coalition won all seats, leading to there being no opposition.

The Parliament of Malaysia is permitted to legislate on issues of land, Islamic religion and local government to provide for a uniform law between different states, or on the request of the state assembly concerned. The law in question must also be passed by the state assembly as well, except in the case of certain land law-related subjects. Non-Islamic issues that fall under the purview of the state may also be legislated on at the federal level for the purpose of conforming with Malaysian treaty obligations. Each state is further divided into districts, which are then divided into mukim. In Sabah and Sarawak districts are grouped into &quot;Divisions&quot;.

The 3 federal territories were formed for different purposes: Kuala Lumpur is the national capital, Putrajaya is the administrative centre of the federal government, and Labuan serves as an offshore financial centre. Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya were carved out of Selangor, while Labuan was ceded by Sabah. The territories fall under the purview of the Ministry of the Federal Territories, and the Parliament of Malaysia legislates on all matters concerning the territories. Each federal territory elects representatives from single-member constituencies drawn based on population to the &quot;Dewan Rakyat&quot; (House of Representatives) of the Parliament. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints senators to represent the territories in the Dewan Negara; Kuala Lumpur has two senators, while Putrajaya and Labuan each has one.

The local governments for the territories varies: Kuala Lumpur is administered by the Kuala Lumpur City Hall (&quot;Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur&quot;), headed by an appointed mayor (&quot;Datuk Bandar&quot;), while Putrajaya is administered by the Putrajaya Corporation (&quot;Perbadanan Putrajaya&quot;) and Labuan by the Labuan Corporation (&quot;Perbadanan Labuan&quot;); each corporation is headed by a chairman.

==Sabah and Sarawak==

The states of Sabah and Sarawak merged with the existing states of the Federation of Malaya and Singapore pursuant to the Malaysia Agreement in 1963 to form the independent state of Malaysia. Representatives from Sabah and Sarawak demanded a higher degree of autonomy as part of the bargain which were included in the 20-point agreement and 18-point agreement respectively. While both states arguably joined the federation as equals to Malaya, the Malayan government and constitution became the Malaysian government and constitution. The constitutional amendment codifying the enlarged federation initially listed Sabah and Sarawak separately to the other states, however it was later amended again to list both these entities together with the other states, suggesting a status equal to the original states of Malaya. Sabah and Sarawak still retained a higher degree of autonomy than the peninsular states in areas such as immigration, state revenue, and legislative power over land and local government. However, federal influence over their politics increased over time, including direct interference in the state assemblies.

===Restoration of Sabah and Sarawak status===

In conjunction with the celebration of Malaysia Day in 2018 under the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad promised to restore Sabah and Sarawak status in the Malaysian federation in accordance with the Malaysia Agreement, restoring &quot;their status from merely a state to an equal partner of the Malayan states&quot;. Although the status of both entities were clearly defined in Article I, Malaysia Agreement 1963 as &#x27;states&#x27; which shall be federated with the existing states of the Federation of Malaya. However, through the process of the amendment, the bill failed to pass following the failure to reach two-thirds majority support (148 votes) in the Parliament with only 138 agreed with the move while 59 abstained from the voting. Nevertheless, the Malaysian federal government agreed to review the 1963 agreement to remedy breaches of the treaty with the &quot;Special Cabinet Committee To Review the Malaysia Agreement&quot; and directed a Special Task Force Team (Taskforce MA63) to prepare a final report on the 1963 agreement before 31 August 2019.

Two years after the failed attempt, on 16 September 2021, Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob pledged to look into issues relating to Sabah and Sarawak via the Special Council on Malaysia Agreement 1963, with negotiations being chaired by the Prime Minister, joined by the Chief Ministers of Sabah and Sarawak, as well as eight federal ministers. On 19 October 2021, Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department (Sabah and Sarawak Affairs) Maximus Ongkili announced a Bill to be tabled in the coming Parliament sitting after the Special Council on Malaysia Agreement 1963 agreed to Articles 1(2) and 160(2) of the Federal Constitution to restore Sabah and Sarawak as equal partners to Peninsular Malaysia. The proposed law differs from the 2019 proposed amendments by the then Pakatan Harapan government, being tabled by Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Department (Law and Parliament) Wan Junaidi. Discussions on restoring Sabahans and Sarawakians&#x27; rights will continue in the meantime. The same meeting also saw the council agree to empower both the Sabah and Sarawah governments to issue deep fishing licences as opposed to the federal government currently. The amendments were tabled on 3 November 2021, consisting of four changes, being restoring Sabah and Sarawak as &quot;partners&quot;, defining Malaysia Day as the day when Sabah and Sarawak joined and changes to the definition of the Federation, and defining who are natives of Sabah and Sarawak. On 14 December 2021, the proposed amendment was passed in the Parliament unanimously with 199 votes in favour, and 21 MPs absent from the 6-hour long debate. On 6 January 2022, Minister Ongkili announced the setting up of a joint technical committee to study Sabah&#x27;s proposal for increased annual grants in addition to a counteroffer from the Federal Government.

==Singapore and Brunei==

Singapore was a Malaysian state from the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 until it was expelled from the Federation on 9 August 1965. During its time as a state of Malaysia, Singapore had autonomy in the areas of education and labour and was the smallest state in Malaysia by land area, but the largest by population.

Brunei was invited to join the Federation but decided not to in the end due to several issues, such as the status of the Sultan within Malaysia, division of Bruneian oil royalties, and pressure from opposition groups which amounted to the Brunei Revolt.

<doc id="690325" wikidata="Q743074" url="?curid=690325" title="Regions of Mali">
<text>Since 2016, Mali has been divided into ten regions and one capital district. A reorganization of the country from eight to nineteen regions was passed into law in 2012, but of the new regions, only Taoudénit (partitioned from Tombouctou Region) and Ménaka (formerly Ménaka Cercle in Gao Region) have begun to be implemented. Each of the regions bears the name of its capital. The regions are divided into 56 cercles. The cercles and the capital district are divided into 703 communes.

In 2023, Mali has added nine new regions to its administrative structure, bringing the total to 19 regions plus the district of Bamako. This reorganization aims to improve governance and bring public services closer to local populations. This initiative continues the decentralization efforts that began with the creation of the Taoudénit and Ménaka regions in 2016. The nineteen regions in turn are subdivided into 159 &quot;cercle&quot;s and 815 &quot;communes&quot;.

==Demographics==
The most populated region is Sikasso with 2.648 million people, and the least most populated is Kidal with just 38 thousand people.

==Geography==
Though five regions are composed of mainly desert, they also have half the country&#x27;s land mass. The largest region is Taoudénit and the smallest is Ségou, excluding Bamako.
==Regions==
The regions are numbered, originally west to east, with Roman numerals. The capital Bamako is administered separately and is in its own district.
The ten regions and the Bamako District are listed below. The population figures are from the 1998 and 2009 censuses.

<text>Marquis Deon Grissom (born April 17, 1967) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee Brewers, Los Angeles Dodgers, and San Francisco Giants between 1989 and 2005.

With the Expos, Grissom led the National League (NL) in stolen bases in 1991 and 1992, and represented the NL in the MLB All-Star Game in 1993 and 1994. He won the 1995 World Series as a member of the Braves. Grissom won four consecutive Gold Glove Awards from 1993 to 1996.

==Early life and amateur career==
Grissom was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the second-youngest of sixteen children of Marion and Julia Grissom. Grissom was one of fifteen children who survived infancy. He grew up in Red Oak, Georgia, in a house which his father built from scratch while working on the assembly line at the Atlanta Assembly, a Ford plant. Grissom could not afford to play organized baseball in early childhood. When Grissom was 8 or 10 years old, he struck a police officer&#x27;s Cadillac with a rock thrown from a great distance. The officer, who was impressed by the throw, agreed not to charge Grissom if later he would join his youth baseball team.

Grissom attended Lakeshore High School in College Park. He was offered college scholarships in baseball, football and track and field.

Grissom played baseball at Florida A&amp;M University as a pitcher and outfielder. He played two seasons with the Rattlers in 1987 and 1988 during which time he posted a .408 batting average. In 1988, he scored more runs per game and hit more triples per game than any other player in Division I. He was named the Most Outstanding Player of that season&#x27;s Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference baseball tournament after pitching two complete games and maintaining a .643 batting average. He was inducted into the MEAC Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Baseball career==

===Montreal Expos===
In 1988, the Montreal Expos selected Grissom with the 76th overall pick in the amateur draft, as part of that draft&#x27;s third round. He had been considered a prospect as both a pitcher and an outfielder, but the Expos decided to have him work solely as a position player. He made his professional debut with the Jamestown Expos of the New York–Penn League that fall and advanced quickly through the system, first appearing in the majors on August 22, 1989. He showed steady improvement for the next few seasons, gradually developing into a star as Montreal&#x27;s leadoff hitter and center fielder. He led the National League in stolen bases in 1991 and 1992, was a member of the NL All-Star team in 1993 and 1994, and won four consecutive Gold Gloves, the first coming in 1993.

Against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 28, 1991, Grissom caught Chris Gwynn&#x27;s fly ball for the final out of Dennis Martínez&#x27;s perfect game.

===Atlanta Braves===
The Expos enjoyed success on the field, but a strike ended the 1994 season before the playoffs, and after baseball resumed the team was forced to trade many of their stars for financial reasons. Grissom was the last of the three highest-paid Expos players at the time to be traded when he was acquired by the Atlanta Braves for Tony Tarasco, Roberto Kelly and Esteban Yan on April 6, 1995. The Braves beat out the Florida Marlins and Boston Red Sox to land the deal. The Braves were just beginning a run of dominance in the NL East, and in his first season in Atlanta, they won the World Series with Marquis (the only player on that Braves team who actually was born and raised in Atlanta) securing the final out by catching a fly ball by Carlos Baerga. They returned to the Fall Classic the next season, but failed to defend their title against the New York Yankees.

===Cleveland Indians===
Teams&#x27; financial motivations continued to affect the course of Grissom&#x27;s career, and in March 1997, he was involved in a blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Indians. Hoping to save money that had been committed to long-term contracts, Atlanta traded Grissom and two-time All-Star David Justice to the Indians, receiving in return three-time All-Star Kenny Lofton and setup man Alan Embree. The deal worked out well for Cleveland, as the team went all the way to the World Series, ultimately losing to the Florida Marlins in seven games. Grissom performed exceptionally well in that postseason, winning the MVP award in the ALCS, and completing a 15-game World Series consecutive game hitting streak spanning 3 World Series, the 2nd longest of all time next to Hank Bauer of the New York Yankees.

===Later career===
That offseason, however, the Indians re-signed Lofton as a free agent, subsequently trading Grissom and pitcher Jeff Juden to the Milwaukee Brewers for pitchers Ben McDonald, Ron Villone, and Mike Fetters. Grissom&#x27;s production declined as he spent three seasons with the struggling club, and a trade in the spring of 2001 made him a Los Angeles Dodger, sending Devon White to the Brewers in return. Grissom continued to struggle that year, but he enjoyed a strong bounce-back season as a part-time player in 2002. On September 16, 2002, the Dodgers had a crucial game against the San Francisco Giants. In the top of the 9th inning, he robbed Rich Aurilia of a potential game-tying home run to protect the 7–6 victory. The Giants went on to make the playoffs and the Dodgers did not. As a free agent he subsequently attracted the attention of the San Francisco Giants, who had just been defeated in the World Series. San Francisco signed Grissom, and he enjoyed two more productive seasons as their starting center fielder. The Giants were successful as well, winning the NL West in 2003 and missing the wild card by one game in 2004. Marquis won the 2003 Willie Mac Award for his spirit and leadership. On April 8, 2004, Grissom hit the first home run ever at San Diego&#x27;s Petco Park. Grissom&#x27;s production dipped again in 2005, and in a season of struggles by the Giants, he was released. On January 3, 2006, the Chicago Cubs signed him to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training as a non-roster player.

====Retirement====
On March 28, 2006, Grissom retired after a 17-year career. He told &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that he knew it was time for him to retire when he began spending more time preparing for games than playing in the games themselves.

In 2011, Grissom received four votes in the Baseball Hall of Fame balloting.

===Coaching career===
Following his retirement, Grissom became a youth baseball coach. Among other Atlanta-area prospects, Grissom worked with family friend Michael Harris II from his youth through his early professional career. When Harris won the 2022 National League Rookie of the Year Award, he dedicated it to Grissom.

Grissom was hired to become the Washington Nationals first base coach for the 2009 season on October 24, 2008. In November 2009, he was replaced on the coaching staff by Dan Radison.

==Personal Life==
As of 2024, Grissom lives with his wife, Sharron, in Fayetteville and Sandy Springs, Georgia. He has five children, Micah, D&#x27;monte, Tiana, Marquis, Jr. and Gabriella. Marquis Jr. is a pitcher in the Washington Nationals organization, having been drafted out of Georgia Tech in the 2022 MLB Draft. During his playing career, Grissom bought houses for his parents and every one of his fourteen siblings.

One year after retiring, Grissom founded the Marquis Grissom Baseball Association, a nonprofit which helps underprivileged youths in the Atlanta area play baseball.

Grissom&#x27;s younger brother, Antonio, played in the farm systems of the Expos and Philadelphia Phillies.

<text>Ethiopia is a federation subdivided into ethno-linguistically based regional states (Amharic: plural: ክልሎች &quot;kililoch&quot;; singular: ክልል &quot;kilil&quot;; Oromo: singular: &quot;Naannoo&quot;; plural: &quot;Naannolee&quot;) and chartered cities (Amharic: plural: አስተዳደር አካባቢዎች &quot;astedader akababiwoch&quot;; singular: አስተዳደር አካባቢ &quot;astedader akabibi&quot;). This system of administrative regions replaced the provinces of Ethiopia in 1992.

As of August 2023, there are twelve regional states and two chartered cities (Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa). Being based on ethnicity and language, rather than physical geography or history, the regions vary enormously in area and population; the most notable example is the Harari Region, which has a smaller area and population than either of the chartered cities.

==Governance==
The regions are each governed by a regional council whose members are directly elected to represent woredas (districts). Each council has a president, who is elected by the council. Each region also has an executive committee, whose members are selected by the president from among the councilors and approved by the council. Each region has a sector bureau, which implements the council mandate and reports to the executive committee.

==History==
Ethiopia was historically divided into provinces. The current system of administrative regions was introduced in 1992 by the Transitional Government of Ethiopia, and was formalised in 1995 when the current Constitution of Ethiopia came into force.

There were 13 regions initially, but five regions were merged to form the multi-ethnic Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&#x27; Region later in 1992, following the first elections of regional councils on 21 June 1992. The country&#x27;s capital Addis Ababa, and Dire Dawa became chartered cities in 2004.

===New regions===
During the premiership of Abiy Ahmed, several new regions have been created.

In November 2019, a referendum was held in the Sidama Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples&#x27; Region, in which voters supported a proposal for Sidama Zone to become a region in its own right. The Sidama Region was created in June 2020.

The South West Ethiopia Region was created on 23 November 2021 following a successful referendum earlier that year. The new region was split off from the SNNPR and consisted of Keffa, Sheka, Bench Sheko, Dawro, and West Omo Zones, along with Konta special district.

On 19 August 2023 the South Ethiopia Regional State created following the 2023 South Ethiopia Region referendum with the remainder becoming the Central Ethiopia Regional State, thus dissolving the SNNPR.

<doc id="690340" wikidata="Q7263722" url="?curid=690340" title="Pyrotechnic star">
<text>Pyrotechnic stars are pellets of pyrotechnic composition which may contain metal powders, salts or other compounds that, when ignited, burn a certain color or make a certain spark effect. They are a part of all projectile-type fireworks. The most common is the aerial shell. When watching this firework, it will launch into the sky, burning a lifting charge. Once the shell has attained proper altitude, due to other mechanisms within the firework, it will ignite the stars.

==Procedure==
Stars are either rolled, pumped or cut.

*Rolled stars are small cores of a hard material (often lead shot or an organic material such as mustard seeds or even cut stars) which are coated in a rotating mixer similar to a concrete mixer. First, water is sprayed on these cores. Then an amount of a pyrotechnic composition is placed into the mixer. As these two steps are repeated, the stars grow into a larger spherical shape.
*Pumped stars are stars that have been pumped using a star pump. A dampened composition is put in the star pump and is pressed against a flat surface and ejected again, creating cylinder shaped stars.
*Cut stars are stars with a dampened composition spread out onto an even layer on a flat surface. These stars are cut into cubes.

Stars are allowed to dry for several days before being placed into fireworks.

Priming the stars is often necessary because they may be hard to ignite. Priming consists of coating the surface of the star with a more easily ignited substance, such as black powder.

==Putting into use==
Stars can be used in aerial shells, Roman candles, star mines, and certain bottle rockets. When used in aerial shells, the stars may sometimes be required to be &quot;primed&quot; with an ignition coating, consisting of a pyrotechnic mixture with an ignition temperature lower than that of the star. This is usually done if the star composition does not ignite easily.</text><links>

<text>Castleisland () is a town and commercial centre in County Kerry in south west Ireland. The town is known for the width of its main street. As of the 2022 census, Castleisland had a population of 2,536.

Castleisland was described by one of its citizens, journalist Con Houlihan, as &quot;not so much a town as a street between two fields&quot;.

==History==

Castleisland was the centre of Desmond power in Kerry. The village got its name, &#x27;Castle of the Island of Kerry&#x27;, from a castle built in 1226 by Geoffrey Maurice (or de Marisco). Maurice had been the Lord Justice of Ireland during the reign of King Henry III. The island was created by turning the waters of the River Maine into a moat around the castle.

Sometime in the 120 years after its construction, the castle was taken by the forces of the Fitzgerald dynasty. It is known that in 1345 the castle was being held for Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond by Sir Eustace de la Poer and other knights when it was captured by Sir Raoul d&#x27;Ufford, Chief governor of Ireland. Sir Eustace and the other knights were captured and executed. Little is known of the further history of the castle and few ruins are left of it today. The main ruin is the de Marisco tower, located behind some private houses at the western end of the town, on the Killarney Road.

The Black and Tans and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) were active in Castleisland during the Irish War of Independence in the 1920s. On 8 May 1921, two Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men were shot by the IRA while leaving Castleisland Parish Church; one of the men died. Two months later, on 10 July 1921, three IRA men and four British soldiers were killed during a gunfight in the town.

A vagrant juvenile bald eagle was captured near Castleisland in November 1987, exhausted after reputedly flying across the Atlantic Ocean from North America.

==Geography==
Castleisland is in the east of County Kerry, 16 km east of Tralee and 19 km north of Killarney. The town is close to the County Limerick border and to the County Cork border, and the main road in western and southern Kerry passes through here. The N21 road from the city of Limerick continues on to Tralee while the N22 road goes to Killarney and other towns in southern Kerry.

The Glanaruddery Mountains to the north and the Stack&#x27;s Mountains to the west define the beginning of the Vale of Tralee, at the mouth of which Castleisland is situated. Most of the land around Castleisland is pasture for dairy stock, with bogland located at various locations around the town, particularly to the east and south. It is in the barony of Trughanacmy.

==Buildings and places of note==

There are several buildings of note in Castleisland, including the Gothic-styled Church of St. Stephen and St. John which was designed by Doolin and built in 1880. The town&#x27;s Carnegie Trust Library building was designed by R.M. Butler for Tralee District Council. A tender by James O&#x27;Connor, Castleisland, for £1,451.4s.7d. was accepted, subject to the approval of the architect. It was completed by 1915. The library was burnt down in 1920, and replaced by the present structure in 1929 and is located at the eastern end of Castleisland&#x27;s main street. The function of the town library was moved to new premises in 2008, but the original building is still used as the district court for the area.

Crag Cave, one of the most extensive cave systems in Ireland open to the public, is located just outside Castleisland.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Castleisland railway station opened on 30 August 1875. It closed for passenger traffic on 24 February 1947 and for goods traffic on 3 November 1975, finally closing altogether on 10 January 1977.

===Road===
Since the 1990s, traffic congestion had been an issue for Castleisland, as the main road linking most of County Kerry to Limerick and Dublin passed through the town. As a result, the main street through Castleisland dealt not only with local traffic, but also traffic destined for Tralee and Killarney. This resulted in traffic congestion in Castleisland, with delays of over half an hour possible at peak times. Ultimately, the local community decided that action was needed and, ahead of the 2007 Irish general election, a formal lobbying campaign was started.

With funding allocated by the National Roads Authority, construction of the new road started in May 2009. The project involved creating two major new sections of road and one smaller section. It consists of a 3.4 km dual carriageway linking the Limerick road roundabout north of Castleisland to the Tralee road west of the town, and a 1.6 km single carriageway continuing south from the roundabout on the Tralee road to meet the Killarney road roundabout southwest of the town. At the Limerick road end, there is also a 0.4 km section of single carriageway that links the newly constructed Limerick road roundabout to the pre-existing N21 Limerick road. On 22 October 2010, the bypass was officially opened by the then Minister for Defence, Tony Killeen.

==Sport==
Castleisland Desmonds is the local GAA club. They won the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship in 1985, beating St. Vincents of Dublin in the final. The club were also the winner of the 2010 series of RTÉ reality television show &quot;Celebrity Bainisteoir&quot;, while managed by singer Derek Burke of Crystal Swing.

Castleisland A.F.C. are the town&#x27;s representatives in the Kerry District League in soccer.
Castleisland Rugby Football Club U16s was the second rugby club in Kerry, under all age groups, to win a Munster League title in 2008.

An Ríocht Athletics Club, established in 1973, is located at Crageens in Castleisland. Its facilities include a 400-metre tartan athletics track and a soccer pitch. A gym, Barracks Gym, was established in 2018 on Barrack Street in Castleisland.

St Marys is the local basketball club.

<doc id="690345" wikidata="Q27020041" url="?curid=690345" title="Season (sports)">
<text>In an organized sports league, a typical season is the portion of one year in which regulated games of the sport are in session: for example, in Major League Baseball the season lasts approximately from the last week of March to the last week of September. In other team sports, like association football or basketball, it is generally from August or September to May although in some countries – such as Northern Europe, North America or East Asia – the season for oudoor summer sports starts in the spring and finishes in autumn, mainly due to weather conditions encountered during the winter.

A year can often be broken up into several distinct sections (sometimes themselves called seasons). These are: a preseason, a series of exhibition games played for training purposes; a regular season, the main period of the league&#x27;s competition; the postseason, a playoff tournament played against the league&#x27;s top teams to determine the league&#x27;s champion; and the offseason, the time when there is no official competition.

==Preseason==
In association football, many clubs tour and then they have a series of exhibition games for training purposes. Specifically in Brazil, teams play in state championships before the start of the Brazilian League.

In baseball, many clubs go to spring camp and then they have spring training.

In gridiron football, the National Football League&#x27;s preseason and the Canadian Football League&#x27;s preseaon are highly structured three– or two–game series of games, respectively, in which teams are afforded a larger roster limit and play games that do not count toward the record; they are used to evaluate and prepare talent for the upcoming regular season. In college football, particularly that played at the FBS level, a true preseason is not played but many teams play a &quot;spring game&quot; which is an internal team practice structured like a game. 

In the highest levels of professional tennis, the preseason (November–December) consists of extensive period of training on and off the court (gym/fitness work as well as working on tennis-specific skills like for example improving the accuracy of serve).

==Regular season==
In sport, the term &quot;regular season&quot; or &quot;home-and-away season&quot; refers to the sport&#x27;s league competition. The regular season is usually similar to a group tournament format: teams are divided into groups, conferences and/or divisions, and each club plays a set number of games against a set number of opponents. In most countries the league is played in a double round-robin format, where every team plays every other team twice, once at their home venue, and once away at the opposition&#x27;s venue as visitors. The results over all games are accumulated and when every team has completed its full schedule of games, a winner is declared.

In North America, the scheduling is different. Rather than every team playing all others twice, teams usually play more games against local rivals than teams in other parts of the country. For example, the NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers will play the Los Angeles Clippers (a team within their division, a subdivision of the conference) four times in a regular season, while both will only play the Toronto Raptors, who are in the opposite Eastern Conference, twice. Part of this is due to the vast geographic distances between some teams in North America — measured in a straight line, Los Angeles is 3,494 kilometres from Toronto, for instance — and a desire to limit travel expenses. In the scheduling system used in the NFL, it is possible for two teams to only meet every four years, and to only have 2 common opponents in a season. Major League Baseball has the most uneven schedules of all the four major North American sports. In MLB, the conferences are called leagues instead, but have exactly the same effect as conferences (as with all North American major leagues, leagues, conferences, and division are not based on skill, but instead geography, history, and rivalries). Prior to scheduling changes in 2023, teams played 19 games against each of the teams in their own division each year but only played 20 games total against all of the teams in the other league. Because each of the inter-league match-ups was part of a 3-game series or a 2-game series, teams played no games at all against most teams from the other league. They played 6 of the 15 teams in the other league, a historically high number (until 1997, interleague play was limited to exhibition matches and the postseason World Series, and thus MLB teams did not play the other league&#x27;s teams at all). In 2023, teams played all interleague teams in a single season for the first time; teams now play a 3-game series against all teams, except their designated interleague rival with 4 games, totalling to 46 games (later increased to 48 games and a 6-game series with their interleague rival for the forthcoming 2025 season).

In Australia, the two largest football leagues, the AFL (Australian rules football) and NRL (rugby league), both grew out of competitions held within a single city (respectively Melbourne and Sydney) and only began expanding to the rest of the country when inexpensive air travel made a national league possible. These leagues use a single table instead of being split into divisions. The term &quot;home and away season&quot; is sometimes used instead of regular season.

Many football leagues in Latin America have a very different system. Because most Latin American countries never had a football cup competition, they instead split their season into two parts, typically known as the Apertura and Clausura (Spanish for &quot;opening&quot; and &quot;closing&quot;). Most countries that use this system, Argentina being one notable example, crown separate league champions for each part of the season, using only league play. A few others, such as Uruguay, crown one champion at the end of a playoff involving top teams from each half of the season. Mexico operates its Apertura and Clausura as separate competitions that both end in playoffs. Brazil has a different system, the season starts with the state championships in January (every Brazilian state have his own championship), these state championships ends in April. The Campeonato Brasileiro Série A itself starts in May and ends in early December, and is played in a double round-robin format in the same way as the European championships.

A system similar to the Apertura and Clausura developed independently in Philippine professional basketball, with formerly two, now three tournaments (called &quot;conferences&quot;) in one season, with each conference divided into an &quot;elimination round&quot; (the single round-robin group stage) and the playoffs in the North American sense. Winning the playoffs is the ultimate goal of every team for every conference; while there is no season championship, winning all conferences within a single season is rare and has only happened five times since 1975, with the two most recent examples occurring in 1996 and 2013–14. The qualifying round and playoffs setup has permeated down to the local level and in most team sports, although seasons are not divided into conferences.

==Postseason==
Many sports leagues have playoffs or &quot;finals&quot; that occur after the regular season is complete. A subset of the teams enter into a playoff tournament, usually a knockout tournament, generally a pre-determined number with better overall records (more wins, fewer losses) during the regular season. There are many variations used to determine the champion, the league&#x27;s top prize. In many of these leagues, winning the league&#x27;s top prize at the conclusion of the postseason is more important than winning the regular season. This includes the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada (MLB&#x27;s World Series, the NBA Finals, the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl, the NHL&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals, the MLS Cup, and the CFL&#x27;s Grey Cup), and the major Australian sports (BBL Grand Final, NBL Grand Final, A-League Grand Final, AFL Grand Final and NRL Grand Final).

European leagues have also started holding playoffs after a double round-robin &quot;regular season&quot;. The Football League started its promotion playoffs in 1987, with the third up to the sixth-ranked teams participating for the final promotion berth (the two top teams are automatically promoted). Elsewhere, relegation playoffs are also held to determine which teams would be relegated to the lower leagues. One prominent top-level football league, the Eredivisie of the Netherlands, uses two different playoffs—one for relegation purposes, and the other to determine one of the league&#x27;s entrants in the following season&#x27;s UEFA Europa League. In Superleague Greece, which currently has two places in the UEFA Champions League and three in the Europa League, the teams that finish second through fifth in the regular season enter a home-and-away &quot;playoff&quot; mini-league. Since one Europa League place is reserved for the country&#x27;s cup winner, only three of the four teams are guaranteed a place in the next season&#x27;s European competitions (unless both the cup winner and runner-up are already qualified for Europe by other means). The playoff determines the country&#x27;s second Champions League participant, and the points at which the two or three Europa League entrants join that competition. Conversely, some leagues like the Premier League do not hold a postseason, and therefore these leagues&#x27; champions and relegation are instead based on the regular season records.

Although rugby union did not become professional until 1995, that sport has a long history of playoffs, primarily in France and the Southern Hemisphere. The French national championship, now known as Top 14, staged a championship final in its first season of 1892, first used more than one round of playoffs in 1893, and has continuously operated a playoff system (except during the two World Wars) since 1899. South Africa&#x27;s Currie Cup has determined its champions by playoffs since 1968, and New Zealand&#x27;s National Provincial Championship, the top level of which is now known as the Mitre 10 Cup, has used playoffs since its creation in 1976. Argentina&#x27;s Nacional de Clubes has determined its champion by playoffs since its inception in 1993. Currently, two separate competitions feed into the Nacional, the Torneo de la URBA (for Buenos Aires clubs, held since 1899) and Torneo del Interior (for the rest of the country); both use playoffs to determine their champions. Super Rugby, involving regional franchises from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa and national franchises in Argentina and Japan, has used playoffs to determine its champions since its creation as Super 12 in 1996.

By contrast, other European countries were slow to adopt playoffs in rugby union. The English Premiership only began playoffs in 1999–2000, and did not use them to determine the league champion until 2002–03. The Celtic League, now known as Pro14, resisted a playoff system even longer; its champions were determined solely by league play from its inception in 2001–02 until playoffs began in 2009–10.

When the UEFA Champions League reformatted in 1993, it added a &quot;knockout stage&quot; involving four teams that finished at the top two places in their respective groups. Like North American sports leagues, this setup prevented some participants from facing each other, necessitating a two-round knockout stage to determine the champions. It has since been expanded to the 4-round knockout stage today. The Copa Libertadores has applied a knockout stage since the 1988 tournament, expanding to the current four-round format next season. All intercontinental club football competitions now feature a knockout stage.

==Off-season==
The off-season, vacation time, or close season is the time of year when there is no official competition. During this time, events such as drafts, transfers and off-season free agent signings may occur. Generally, athletes continue training to some extent during the off-season in preparation for the next season.

As most countries which have a league in a particular sport will operate their regular season at roughly the same time as the others, international tournaments may be arranged during the off season. For example, most European football league club competitions run from July or August to May, and so major international competitions such as the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Football Championship are organised to occur in June and July.

==Seasons by league==
The table represents typical seasons for some leagues by month. Blank or white denotes off-season and pre-season months and solid colors mark the rest of the year. Leagues in the same sport use the same color.

* &quot;E&quot; denotes exhibition/preseason games.
* &quot;Q&quot; denotes pre-competition qualifiers.
* &quot;S&quot; denotes the start of the regular-season.
* &quot;P&quot; denotes playoff(s)/postseason/knockout stages.
* &quot;F&quot; denotes Final(s).

<doc id="690346" wikidata="Q17105794" url="?curid=690346" title="Signal strength in telecommunications">
<text>In telecommunications, particularly in radio frequency engineering, signal strength refers to the transmitter power output as received by a reference antenna at a distance from the transmitting antenna. High-powered transmissions, such as those used in broadcasting, are expressed in dB-millivolts per metre (dBmV/m). For very low-power systems, such as mobile phones, signal strength is usually expressed in dB-microvolts per metre (dBμV/m) or in decibels above a reference level of one milliwatt (dBm). In broadcasting terminology, 1 mV/m is 1000 μV/m or 60 dBμ (often written dBu).

;Examples:
*100 dBμ or 100 mV/m: blanketing interference may occur on some receivers 
*60 dBμ or 1.0 mV/m: frequently considered the edge of a radio station&#x27;s protected area in North America
*40 dBμ or 0.1 mV/m: the minimum strength at which a station can be received with acceptable quality on most receivers

==Relationship to average radiated power==

The electric field strength at a specific point can be determined from the power delivered to the transmitting antenna, its geometry and radiation resistance. Consider the case of a center-fed half-wave dipole antenna in free space, where the total length L is equal to one half wavelength (λ/2). If constructed from thin conductors, the current distribution is essentially sinusoidal and the radiating electric field is given by

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the angle between the antenna axis and the vector to the observation point, formula_3 is the peak current at the feed-point, formula_4 is the permittivity of free-space, formula_5 is the speed of light in vacuum, and formula_6 is the distance to the antenna in meters. When the antenna is viewed broadside (formula_7) the electric field is maximum and given by 
:formula_8

Solving this formula for the peak current yields

:formula_9

The average power to the antenna is

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the center-fed half-wave antenna&#x27;s radiation resistance. Substituting the formula for formula_12 into the one for formula_13 and solving for the maximum electric field yields

:formula_14

Therefore, if the average power to a half-wave dipole antenna is 1 mW, then the maximum electric field at 313 m (1027 ft) is 1 mV/m (60 dBμ).

For a short dipole (formula_15) the current distribution is nearly triangular. In this case, the electric field and radiation resistance are

:formula_16

Using a procedure similar to that above, the maximum electric field for a center-fed short dipole is

:formula_17

==RF signals==

Although there are cell phone base station tower networks across many nations globally, there are still many areas within those nations that do not have good reception. Some rural areas are unlikely to ever be covered effectively since the cost of erecting a cell tower is too high for only a few customers. Even in areas with high signal strength, basements and the interiors of large buildings often have poor reception.

Weak signal strength can also be caused by destructive interference of the signals from local towers in urban areas, or by the construction materials used in some buildings causing significant attenuation of signal strength. Large buildings such as warehouses, hospitals and factories often have no usable signal further than a few metres from the outside walls.

This is particularly true for the networks which operate at higher frequency since these are attenuated more by intervening obstacles, although they are able to use reflection and diffraction to circumvent obstacles.

===Estimated received signal strength===
The estimated received signal strength in an active RFID tag can be estimated as follows:
:formula_18

In general, you can take the path loss exponent into account:
:formula_19

The effective path loss depends on frequency, topography, and environmental conditions.

Actually, one could use any known &quot;signal power&quot; dBm0 at any distance r0 as a reference:
:formula_20

===Number of decades===
:formula_21 would give an estimate of the number of decades, which coincides with an average path loss of 40 dB/decade.

===Estimate the cell radius===
When we measure cell distance &quot;r&quot; and received power pairs,
we can estimate the mean cell radius as follows:

:formula_22

Specialized calculation models exist to plan the location of a new cell tower, taking into account local conditions and radio equipment parameters, as well as consideration that mobile radio signals have line-of-sight propagation, unless reflection occurs.

<doc id="690363" wikidata="Q5593448" url="?curid=690363" title="Grahm Junior College">
<text>Grahm Junior College was a non-profit junior college located in Boston, Massachusetts. It opened in 1951 under the name Cambridge School, as part of a chain of schools that started in New York City and later included Chicago and Philadelphia branches. It was accredited in 1964 as a business school and later expanded to include radio and TV broadcasting. It was renamed Grahm Junior College in 1968. The college radio station and a closed-circuit television station were known as WCSB.

==History==
The school opened in 1951 under the name Cambridge School, as part of a private chain of schools based in New York City. Originally located at 18 Tremont Street, it moved to 120 Boylston Street, then to 687 Boylston Street, and finally to Kenmore Square. The 687 Boylston Street building, &quot;The Kensington&quot; had two lions flanking the entrance, and the school therefore adopted the lion as its mascot. The same lions now flank the entrance to the Fairmont Copley Hotel. The Cambridge School became accredited as a Junior College of business in 1964 and later expanded its offerings to include secretarial studies, hospitality, and radio and TV broadcasting.

At its peak enrollment of 1,300 students in 1968, the school occupied 4 buildings in Boston&#x27;s Kenmore Square, the notable Hotel Kenmore (dormitories), Wadsworth Hall (dormitories) the present-day Hotel Buckminster (dormitories and classrooms) and 632 Beacon Street (offices, classrooms and broadcast studios). The Cambridge School purchased 632 Beacon Street in May 1965 from the Hotel Corporation of America. It had been previously owned by the Lumber Mutual Insurance Company. Sale prices was purported to be under three million dollars. The Kenmore Hotel was purchased by the Cambridge School in 1965. The Saint George Hotel (circa 1911) was purchased in 1966 (appraised at $300,000) and renamed Leavitt Hall.

In 1968, the school was renamed Grahm Junior College after its long-term president, Milton L. Grahm. In September the same year, it was restructured as a non-profit institution. In 1969, the college announced a $6 million development program, including $500,000 of equipment. It included two television studios and radio studios. The library was expanded and 14 classrooms were added. A physical education facility, classrooms, offices and an endowment were envisioned, but never realized. In 1974, the school received accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

By 1974, enrollment at Grahm was declining, attributed by many to the end of the military draft and the rise of the community college system. In the mid-1970s many two-year colleges began to close or shed buildings or other assets. The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; reported that 30 out of 40 two year and trade schools closed between 1970 and 1980. In early 1977 Grahm&#x27;s financial distress was publicly disclosed. Enrollment had declined 12 percent in three years. Staff salaries were cut and others were laid off. Fuel bills and inability to refinance were cited by the college administration as primary causes.

In March 1977 Grahm Junior College filed for reorganization under the bankruptcy code, citing $3 million in assets and $3.326 million in liabilities. Creditors repossessed much of the school&#x27;s instructional assets in April 1979. Faculty continued to teach without pay in order for the final class to graduate, and the school closed that summer. Boston University purchased 632 Beacon St. (Myles Annex), 490 Commonwealth (Kenmore Hall) and the adjacent Wadsworth Hall in October 1979. The rights to the academic programs were acquired by Mount Ida College.

<doc id="690366" wikidata="Q436192" url="?curid=690366" title="M-185 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-185 is a state trunkline highway in the U.S. state of Michigan that circles Mackinac Island, a popular tourist destination on the Lake Huron side of the Straits of Mackinac, along the island&#x27;s shoreline. A narrow paved road of , it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the Upper and the Lower peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and Michigan. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The City of Mackinac Island, which shares jurisdiction over the island with the Mackinac Island State Park Commission (MISPC), calls the highway Main Street within the built-up area on the island&#x27;s southeast quadrant, and Lake Shore Road elsewhere. M-185 passes by several important sites within Mackinac Island State Park, including Fort Mackinac, Arch Rock, British Landing, and Devil&#x27;s Kitchen. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water&#x27;s edge and woodlands outside the downtown area.

According to the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), M-185 is &quot;the only state highway in the nation where motor vehicles are banned&quot;. Traffic on it is by foot, on horse, by horse-drawn vehicle, or by bicycle. Restrictions on automobiles date back to 1898, and since the ban, only a few vehicles have been permitted on the island other than the city&#x27;s emergency vehicles. The highway was built during the first decade of the 20th century by the state and designated as a state highway in 1933. The highway was paved in 1960, and portions were rebuilt to deal with shoreline erosion in the 1980s. Until an accident in 2005, it was the only state highway without any automobile accidents.

==Route description==
As a circular highway, M-185 has no specific termini; the generally accepted starting point is at the mile 0 marker placed in front of the Mackinac Island State Park Visitor Center. The highway uses wooden markers to measure miles instead of the common metal signage; these signs are erected by the MISPC, as MDOT does not install the standard state highway reassurance markers along this roadway. M-185 is one of only three state trunkline highways in Michigan on islands; the others are M-134 on Drummond Island and M-154 on Harsens Island. No part of M-185 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility. Over a half million people travel along the trunkline in a year.

Mackinac Island has been a tourist destination since the late 19th century. The island was the country&#x27;s second national park, after Yellowstone, until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park. M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. In 2003, it was named the &quot;best scenic drive&quot; in the state by &quot;The Detroit News&quot;. In 2008, &quot;USA Today&quot; named the island one of the &quot;10 great places to get your feet back on the ground&quot; as a car-free destination, highlighting the unique status of M-185 in the process. The magazine &quot;Paraplegia News&quot;, in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island, called the trek around the island on M-185 a &quot;high priority&quot; for visitors. The trip around the island &quot;provides a photo opportunity at every bend in the path&quot;, according to the &quot;PSA Journal&quot;, the official magazine of the Photographic Society of America.

===Along the harbor===

The beginning and ending of M-185 is marked at the intersection of Main and Fort streets next to the visitor center. That building is operated by the MISPC, but it was originally a US Coast Guard station. From its starting point, M-185 heads east between Marquette Park, at the base of Fort Mackinac, and the marina at Haldimand Bay. The roadway passes the Indian Dormitory (Mackinac Art Center), as well as various hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, private residences and landmarks such as Sainte Anne&#x27;s Catholic Church, Mission Church and the Mission House. Main Street then turns northeasterly, passing Mission Point Resort (the former Mackinac College), after which the road name changes to Lake Shore Road. Along this section of the trunkline, Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water&#x27;s edge before returning to M-185 at the city&#x27;s water filtration plant.

===Around the island===
After rounding Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly along the eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile 1 marker. The next two miles (3.2 km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur&#x27;s Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile 3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile 3, Scott&#x27;s Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott&#x27;s Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods on one side and the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.
Mile 4 is situated at Point aux Pins at the northernmost point of the island. Here, M-185 turns southerly, passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to British Landing at the intersection with British Landing Road. The area is a popular stopping point for tourists biking or walking M-185; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the Battle of Mackinac Island during the War of 1812. Located around British Landing are various amenities including restrooms, picnic tables, and a concession stand. M-185 continues along Maniboajo Bay and passes the mile 5 marker near Radisson Point.

The next area along M-185 is also sparsely developed as it passes along Griffin Cove. Other than a few newer residential developments, the sights are limited to Brown&#x27;s Brook, which features a picnic area and interpretive nature trail, and the views of the Mackinac Bridge as the trunkline rounds both Heriot and Perrot points. Between the markers for miles 6 and 7 is Devil&#x27;s Kitchen, another popular tourist stopping point, at Jacker Point. Near mile 7 is the West Bluff Stairs leading up the bluff to Pontiac&#x27;s Lookout. Further along, there is a marker commemorating the filming of a scene from &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; as well as views of the Grand Hotel. The building&#x27;s front porch is promoted as the &quot;longest in the world&quot;. Visible to the east of the hotel is Michigan&#x27;s second Governor&#x27;s Mansion, which is used as a summer retreat for the state&#x27;s chief executive. At this point, M-185 transitions back to the more developed portion of the island and the road name for the trunkline changes back to Main Street. Next to the roadway, a boardwalk runs from here into the downtown business district.

===Entering downtown===

The first landmark as the highway approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island&#x27;s public school building. As it passes the island&#x27;s public library on the shoreline side of the street, Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle&#x27;s, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city&#x27;s public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets feature the authentic Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area. At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.

==History==
The first city ordinances banning all motorized vehicles from the island were passed on July 6, 1898, with similar state park rules coming in 1901. The residents complained after a doctor&#x27;s car scared their horses and caused carriage accidents, and these complaints prompted the ban. This ban was extended to &quot;motor bicycles&quot; in 1907. As such, other than a handful of emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special, limited-time permit, no cars or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M-185. During the winter months, the Mackinac Island Police sometimes patrols the island by snowmobile. Traffic on this highway is by foot, on horse, by horse-drawn vehicle, or by bicycle; M-185 is the only such state highway in the country &quot;that allows no automobiles&quot;. As a result, the roadside litter is picked up using a horse-drawn wagon.

Lake Shore Road around the island was built between 1900 and 1910 by the state. The M-185 designation was first assigned in 1933 when park officials convinced the state highway commissioner to add the roadway to the state highway system because their budget could not cover the maintenance costs. The roadway was purpose-built for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. Its width is the equivalent of a standard highway lane. In late 1960, the state paved the road in asphalt, replacing the previous limestone and manure composition used previously. With the cessation of the car ferries across the Straits of Mackinac, and the extra costs to get the necessary equipment to the island, annual maintenance rose to $14,000/year (equivalent to $/year in ). After the resurfacing, annual costs were expected to drop to $5,000/year (equivalent to $/year in ). Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter. In 1976, a centerline was painted on the highway for the first time, and provisions for bicycle parking were added to the downtown sections. Work was also done to mitigate erosion in the $200,000 (equivalent to $ in ) project.
In the mid-1980s, rising water levels in Lake Huron endangered M-185 and bicyclists. The roadway was overwashed by waves from the lake during a storm on May 31, 1985; the waves littered the road with gravel and dirt and raised fears of erosion. MDOT spent around $50,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to install of rock and filter cloth designed to prevent erosion. The expectation at the time was that Lake Huron could rise another that summer. Such a lake level increase prompted worries that the waves would wash away sections of the road. The lake had already washed away shoreline near Arch Rock; there was at least of berm between the road and shoreline in the 1970s and by 1985 some sections had been reduced to just . Storms later that year washed away sections of M-185, removing huge chunks of asphalt. MDOT closed those stretches on July 7, 1986, after the Independence Day weekend, to fix the damage. Repairs were budgeted to replace the missing sections of roadway at a cost of $894,366 (equivalent to $ in ); tourists were detoured inland, and uphill, to access the island&#x27;s various tourist attractions.

In 1979, while filming &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;, a car was brought on the island for Christopher Reeve&#x27;s character to drive. The next time that a vehicle was permitted on the island was on July 6, 1998, to commemorate the original ordinance that prohibited cars from Mackinac Island. A 1901 Geneva steam-powered car toured the island and was exhibited in Marquette Park before being towed by horse back to British Landing. When Vice President Mike Pence visited the island in September 2019 to attend the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference, he was accompanied by an eight-vehicle motorcade, a first for the island; a car was hidden on the island in case of emergency when President Gerald R. Ford visited in 1975.

MDOT obtained a $242,000 grant (equivalent to $ in ) from the Federal Highway Administration in 2002 to purchase conservation easements along M-185. The land adjacent to the highway on the east side of the island is publicly owned while along the west it is mostly private. The grant allowed the MISPC and MDOT to either purchase the development rights to adjacent properties along Lake Shore Road, or the adjacent properties themselves.

The only known motor vehicle collision on Mackinac Island occurred on M-185 at the head of the Shepler passenger ferry dock on May 13, 2005, when the island&#x27;s fire truck slightly damaged the door on the island&#x27;s ambulance; both vehicles were responding to a report from the ferryboat that an injured passenger required medical attention. Before this incident, it was the only state highway that &quot;never had an automobile accident&quot; according to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;.

In early 2016, the Native American Cultural Trail was created along M-185. The trail consists of a series of six information panels with bicycle parking areas. The panels were created in a collaboration between the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians and the MISPC along with funding by Mackinac Associates, a friends group that works with the state park. A portion of M-185 was resurfaced starting in September 2016. MDOT estimated the cost to be $900,000 (equivalent to $ in ).

In late 2019, high water levels and winter storms damaged sections of the highway, and MDOT initiated emergency repairs including some erosion mitigation measures at a projected cost of $350,000. Further reconstruction work was started in 2020 to repair about half of the highway at a cost of about $1.4 million. M-185 was closed at the state park boundary north of the Mission Point Resort to British Landing, a distance of about in mid-June. This project includes the installation of rip-rap to help protect the roadway from rising water levels in the Great Lakes. MDOT plans to have the project completed by mid-September and to open sections of the highway to tourist traffic in stages as work is completed, starting with the stretch north to Arch Rock. Additionally to accommodate tourists, the roadway will be initially rebuilt with a gravel surface to be paved later in the year as work progresses.

In 2024, M-185 was the last state highway in Michigan to receive a speed limit. Legislation signed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer set a limit of along the highway, noting that some e-bikes could reach speeds of .

<doc id="690370" wikidata="Q244339" url="?curid=690370" title="Administrative divisions of Georgia (country)">
<text>The subdivisions of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] are autonomous republics (, &quot;avt’onomiuri resp’ublik’a&quot;), regions (მხარე, &quot;mkhare&quot;), and municipalities (, &quot;munitsip’alit’et’i&quot;).

Georgia is a unitary state, whose borders are defined by the law as corresponding to the situation of 21 December 1991. It includes two autonomous republics (, &quot;avt’onomiuri resp’ublik’a&quot;), those of Adjara and Abkhazia, the latter being outside Georgia&#x27;s effective control. The former Soviet-era autonomous entity of South Ossetia is also not currently under Georgia&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; jurisdiction, and has no final defined constitutional status in Georgia&#x27;s territorial arrangement.

The territory of Georgia is currently subdivided into a total of 69 municipalities of which 5 are self-governing cities (ქალაქი, &quot;kalaki&quot;), including the nation&#x27;s capital of Tbilisi, and 64 municipalities consisting of multiple urban or rural settlements which are grouped in administrative communities (თემი, temi) within the municipality. The municipalities outside the two autonomous republics and Tbilisi are grouped, on a provisional basis, into nine regions (&quot;mkhare&quot;): Guria, Imereti, Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, Mtskheta-Mtianeti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti, Samtskhe-Javakheti, and Shida Kartli. Tbilisi itself is divided into ten districts (რაიონი, &quot;raioni&quot;).

==Autonomous republics==
The two autonomous republics, Abkhazia and Adjara, were established during the Soviet era and are recognized by the modern Constitution of Georgia adopted in 1995.

===Adjara===

Adjara is subdivided into 6 municipalities:
# The self-governing city of Batumi, which is the entity&#x27;s capital;
# The self-governing municipality of Keda;
# The self-governing municipality of Kobuleti; 
# The self-governing municipality of Khelvachauri; 
# The self-governing municipality of Shuakhevi; 
# The self-governing municipality of Khulo.

===Abkhazia===

As a result of the military conflicts in 1992–1993 and 2008, Georgia has no effective control over Abkhazia, whose declaration of independence is recognized by Russia and three other UN member states. Georgia considers Abkhazia as its autonomous republic, whose government sits in exile in Tbilisi, and currently an occupied territory. Abkhazia&#x27;s territory, in the Kodori Valley, which had been under Georgia&#x27;s control prior to the Russo–Georgian War of 2008, is &quot;de jure&quot; the self-governing community of Azhara. Abkhazia&#x27;s secessionist government divides the entity&#x27;s territory into seven districts (&quot;raion&quot;).

===South Ossetia===

South Ossetia enjoyed the status of an autonomous oblast in the Soviet era. When Georgia became independent, South Ossetia covered four municipalities that are &quot;de jure&quot; in separate present-day Georgian regions (established only after 1994): the eastern tip of Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, the north-east part of Imereti, the northern half of Shida Kartli, and the western part of Mtskheta-Mtianeti.

After the military conflicts in 1991–1992 and 2008, Georgia considers the former Autonomous Oblast of South Ossetia an occupied territory. Its status is not constitutionally defined by Georgia, but there is an Administration of South Ossetia sitting in exile in Tbilisi. The territory which had been under Georgia&#x27;s control prior to the Russo–Georgian War of 2008, was organized into four municipalities, which retain their &quot;de jure&quot; status. South Ossetia&#x27;s secessionist government divides the entity&#x27;s territory into four districts (&quot;raion&quot;).

The laws of Georgia include a notion that the final subdivision and system of local self-government should be established after the restoration of the state&#x27;s sovereignty in the occupied territories.

==Regions==
Regions (&quot;mkhare&quot;) were established by presidential decrees from 1994 to 1996, on a provisional basis until the secessionist conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia are resolved. They roughly correspond to the traditional principal historical and geographical areas of Georgia. A region is not a self-governing unit; its function is, rather, to coordinate communication of several municipalities (with the exception of the municipalities of Adjara and that of Tbilisi) with the central government of Georgia, which is represented in a region by an official appointed by Prime Minister, the State Commissioner (), informally known as &quot;governor&quot; ().
==Municipalities==
According to the Georgian law, a municipality is a settlement or a group of settlements with defined borders and self-government. There are two types of municipalities—self-governing cities, five in total, and self-governing communities, 64 in total as of January 2019. The current municipalities were established between 2006 and 2017. Most of the municipalities recapitulate the boundaries and names of earlier subdivisions, known as &quot;raioni&quot; (district).

<doc id="690379" wikidata="Q1773576" url="?curid=690379" title="Toronto Roadrunners">
<text>The Toronto Roadrunners were an ice hockey team in the American Hockey League. They played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at the Ricoh Coliseum. In their only season the Roadrunners featured players such as Jani Rita, Brad Winchester, Jamie Wright and Steve Valiquette who helped them advance to the AHL playoffs where they lost the first round to the Cleveland Barons.

==History==
In the early 2000s, there were efforts to refurbish CNE Coliseum for a minor professional team. Plans to move the dormant Phoenix Roadrunners of the International Hockey League to Toronto for the 2002–03 season fell apart when the league dissolved and six teams, but not the Roadrunners, were absorbed by the American Hockey League (AHL) in the summer of 2001. The same group then attempted to purchase the Louisville Panthers AHL franchise, which had suspended operations for the 2001–02 season, and relocate it to the Coliseum, but the AHL voted against the transaction in December 2001. The Toronto Maple Leafs pressured the Hamilton Bulldogs, who held territorial rights to Toronto since it fell within their 50-mile home territory, to veto the transaction. The Leafs reportedly did not want the Coliseum to be upgraded as it would compete with their newly opened Air Canada Centre. Next, the group began pursuing the Bulldogs, which were owned by the NHL&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers. The Bulldogs did not require league approval to move to Toronto since the Coliseum was within their territory.

After an agreement was reached with the Oilers to relocate the Bulldogs to Toronto, and to rename them the Toronto Roadrunners, the City of Toronto agreed to an extensive renovation of the Coliseum for the team in November 2002. At a cost of $38 million, the arena&#x27;s capacity was expanded from 6,500 to 9,700 by building a new higher roof, lowering the floor and adding new seats in the expanded area. As part of the renovation, the city sold naming rights to Ricoh Canada. The renovated building has 38 private suites. Simultaneously, the Quebec Citadelles were moved to Hamilton to replace the Bulldogs.

While initial owner Lyle Abrhams brought the franchise to Toronto with good intentions, poor attendance except when playing the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, a questionable business model, and a dispute with building officials resulted in the relocation of the franchise to Edmonton, Alberta after only one season, becoming the Edmonton Road Runners. Another factor was the desire of the parent club to have the team play in Edmonton to fill the void due to the expected 2004–05 NHL lockout. Since Abrhams owned the rights to the name and logo, the Roadrunners name and identity returned as the Phoenix RoadRunners in the ECHL and later would resurface as the Tucson Roadrunners in the AHL in 2016. The void in Toronto was filled in 2005 when the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs relocated from Atlantic Canada to the Ricoh Coliseum and became the Toronto Marlies.

<doc id="690383" wikidata="Q188604" url="?curid=690383" title="Counties of Hungary">
<text>Hungary is subdivided administratively into 19 counties (&quot;vármegyék&quot;, singular: &quot;vármegye&quot;) and the capital city (&quot;főváros&quot;) Budapest. The counties are further subdivided into 174 districts (&quot;járások&quot;, singular: &quot;járás&quot;). The capital Budapest is subdivided into 23 districts (&quot;kerületek&quot;, singular: &quot;kerület&quot;).

There are 25 cities with county rights (&quot;megyei jogú városok&quot;, singular: &quot;megyei jogú város&quot;), sometimes called urban counties. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers but they are not independent territorial units.

The current system of counties has evolved from medieval fiefdoms of the Kingdom of Hungary; each fiefdom was ruled from a castle (Hungarian: &quot;vár&quot;). Between 1950 and 2022, the counties of Hungary were officially called &quot;megyék&quot; (singular: &quot;megye&quot;). On 1 January 2023, the original historical name &quot;vármegye&quot; was officially restored.

== List of counties ==

There are seven towns with county&#x27;s rights in addition to the county seats:

* Baja (Bács-Kiskun county)
* Dunaújváros (Fejér county)
* Esztergom (Komárom-Esztergom county)
* Érd (Pest county)
* Hódmezővásárhely (Csongrád-Csanád county)
* Nagykanizsa (Zala county)
* Sopron (Győr-Moson-Sopron county)

Duhamel has ventured into film, appearing as one of the main protagonists in four of the &quot;Transformers&quot; films, most recently in the fifth entry, &quot;&quot; (2017). He has also appeared in &quot;When in Rome&quot; (2010), &quot;Life as We Know It&quot; (2010), &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve&quot; (2011), &quot;Safe Haven&quot; (2013), and &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; (2014). In 2015, Duhamel co-starred on the short-lived CBS crime drama &quot;Battle Creek&quot;. He has also starred in several video games, most notably &quot;Call of Duty: WWII&quot; (2017). In 2018, he appeared in the coming of age film &quot;Love, Simon&quot;. In 2021, Duhamel starred in the role of Sheldon Sampson in the Netflix superhero series &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. He also played the role of Jacob Lee in the 2022 survival horror game &quot;The Callisto Protocol&quot;.

==Early life==
Duhamel was born in Minot, North Dakota. His mother, Bonnie L. (Bachmeier) Kemper, is a retired teacher and local businesswoman, and his father, Larry Duhamel, is an advertising salesman. Duhamel&#x27;s family is Catholic.

His parents divorced during his youth. He was raised by his mother and stepfather George Kemper. He has a younger sister and two younger maternal half-sisters. After graduating from Minot High School in 1991, Duhamel attended Minot State University and played backup quarterback for the university&#x27;s football team. He planned to attend dental school, but dropped out one-and-a-half credits shy of his undergraduate degree. He later completed his credits, and received his degree in 2005.

==Career==
Duhamel has stated, &quot;After college, I followed an ex-girlfriend to northern California, did a bunch of odd jobs.&quot; He won the title of Male Model of the Year in an International Modeling and Talent Association (IMTA) competition in 1997 (the runner-up was actor Ashton Kutcher).

Duhamel began his acting career as an extra in the music videos for Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Will Go With You (Con te partirò)&quot; and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Genie in a Bottle&quot; in 1999. Josh trained with Scott Sedita Acting Studios. Later that year, he won the role of Leo du Pres on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. His work on the show, especially his character&#x27;s pairing with Greenlee Smythe (portrayed by actress Rebecca Budig), garnered critical acclaim. In 2000, he posed fully nude for Greg Gorman&#x27;s &quot;As I See It&quot; photography book.

In 2003, he received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for the Special Fan Award for America&#x27;s Favorite Couple in 2002, shared with Budig, and a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Leo du Pres. Duhamel left &quot;All My Children&quot; in 2002 to pursue other acting opportunities. In 2003, Duhamel landed a primetime role on the NBC show &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, playing the head of security for the Montecito Casino, Danny McCoy. His character succeeded James Caan&#x27;s as head of the casino after Caan departed the series at the end of the fourth season. The series ended in 2008.

Duhamel made his big-screen acting debut in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&quot;, then starred in the thriller &quot;Turistas&quot; (2006). After watching an episode of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; in which Duhamel&#x27;s character had just returned from the war in Iraq, Steven Spielberg handpicked him for the role of Captain William Lennox in 2007&#x27;s summer blockbuster film &quot;Transformers&quot; (a film for which Spielberg was the executive producer). Duhamel reprised the role in three of the sequels: &quot;&quot;, released in June 2009, &quot;&quot;, released in June 2011, and &quot;&quot;, released in June 2017.

Duhamel was the official pace car driver for the 2009 Indianapolis 500, driving the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro pace car. In 2010, he played the lead role in the film &quot;When in Rome&quot; as Nick Beamon. In 2014 Duhamel starred in the touching drama &quot;You&#x27;re Not You&quot; (2014) playing the husband of Kate (Hilary Swank), who has the degenerative disease ALS.

On March 23, 2013, Duhamel hosted the 2013 Kids&#x27; Choice Awards, which was broadcast live from Los Angeles, California. He and his co-star from &quot;Safe Haven&quot;, Julianne Hough, performed a &quot;Safe Haven&quot;-themed showcase appearance via video on &quot;The Price is Right&quot; with Drew Carey.

In 2016, he starred as Frank Dunning in the Hulu science fiction thriller miniseries &quot;11.22.63&quot;.

In 2018, he was used on a Taco Bell commercial to advertise Mexican spiced fries with nacho cheese sauce called &quot;Web of Fries&quot;.

In March 2018, it was announced that Duhamel will be starring alongside Megan Fox, in the independent family comedy &quot;Think Like a Dog&quot;. In the same year, he starred in the romantic comedy-drama film, &quot;Love, Simon&quot;.

On February 11, 2019, it was announced that Duhamel had been cast as Sheldon Sampson in the Netflix superhero series, &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. The series premiered on May 7, 2021, and was canceled less than a month later.

In February 2021, it was announced that Duhamel would co-star opposite Jennifer Lopez in the upcoming film &quot;Shotgun Wedding&quot;, replacing Armie Hammer, who had left the project in January, following controversy concerning sexually explicit social media activity. In August 2021, it was announced that Duhamel joined Renée Zellweger in &quot;The Thing About Pam&quot; limited series on NBC. He was to play a defense attorney, Joel Schwartz, on this show based on a real-life crime story.

In early 2022, it was announced that Duhamel had been cast as a series regular on &quot;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers&quot;, for its second season, as Colin Cole, a former NHL player-turned-coach who runs the hockey institute.

On September 23, 2022, Duhamel&#x27;s film &quot;Bandit&quot;, based on the best-selling novel and true story about &quot;The Flying Bandit&quot;, was released in theatres and on demand. The film received positive reviews with critics calling it a career-best performance for Duhamel.

== Other ventures ==
In 2005, he became the co-owner of 10 North Main, a restaurant in Minot, North Dakota.

Duhamel is a spokesman for North Dakota tourism and has appeared in promotional videos for the state over the past decade. In 2022, Duhamel was paid $75,000 to become the face of the State’s Tourism Campaign for the next two years.

==Personal life==

=== Relationships and family ===
Duhamel met and began dating singer Stacy Ann Ferguson, better known by her stage name Fergie, in September 2004 after Ferguson appeared on Duhamel&#x27;s show &quot;Las Vegas&quot; with her then-band The Black Eyed Peas. The couple wed on January 10, 2009, in a Catholic ceremony at the Church Estate Vineyards in Malibu, California. They have a son born in August 2013. On September 14, 2017, the couple announced that they had separated earlier in the year. On June 1, 2019, the couple filed for divorce after two years of separation. As of late-November 2019, their divorce was finalized.

In late 2018, Duhamel began dating former Miss World America Audra Mari. On January 8, 2022, Duhamel announced his engagement to Mari. They married on September 10, 2022. In September 2023, it was announced that the couple were expecting their first child together. Their son was born in January 2024. In a 2023 interview, Duhamel said: &quot;That&#x27;s why Audra&#x27;s so great for me. We&#x27;re both hardcore North Dakotans. We both love lake life.&quot;

=== Interests and politics ===
Duhamel is a practicing Catholic and attends church regularly.

On April 8, 2016, Duhamel posted a selfie in which he wore a T-shirt bearing the name of Doug Burgum, then a candidate for the Republican nomination for governor of North Dakota in the 2016 election. On June 28, 2023, Duhamel endorsed Burgum, then governor of North Dakota, in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primary. In an Instagram story, Duhamel wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t normally get involved in politics, but Governor Burgum has become a good friend over the years and I can&#x27;t think of anyone better than him to be our president.&quot;

=== Residence ===
Duhamel owns two cabins in Minnesota. In October 2023, in an interview on &quot;In Depth with Graham Bensinger,&quot; Duhamel said: &quot;And the older I got, the more I wanted to come back here [to North Dakota].&quot; He described his lake house as a place where he &quot;can get back to being who I really am.&quot;

== In the media ==
In 2012, Duhamel was inducted into the Scandinavian-American Hall of Fame, a signature event of Norsk Høstfest. On May 19, 2022, Minot State University named their Summer Theatre stage the &quot;Josh Duhamel Stage&quot; in his honor.

<text>Vanessa Marcil ( ; born October 15, 1968) is an American actress. She is best known for her television roles as Brenda Barrett on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Gina Kincaid on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, and Sam Marquez on &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

==Early life==
Marcil, the youngest of four children, was born in Indio, California, to Patricia Marcil, a herbalist, and Pete Ortiz, a contractor and self-made millionaire. Marcil&#x27;s father is Mexican, and her mother is an American of French and Italian ancestry.

==Career==
Marcil acted in a number of theatre productions before landing the role of Brenda Barrett on the soap opera, &quot;General Hospital&quot;, in 1992. She garnered three Daytime Emmy Award nominations (in 1997, 1998, and 2003) for her portrayal, and she won in 2003 as Outstanding Supporting Actress. In February 1998, she was named Outstanding Lead Actress at the &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards.

On June 14, 1993, she appeared in the Prince music video &quot;Poorgoo,” which was officially released in very limited numbers. In 1994, she was cast in the Prince music video &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World&quot;, and she also made &quot;People&quot;&#x27;s 50 Most Beautiful list the next year. She made her feature-film debut in the film, &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), in which she appeared opposite Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris.

In 1998, after six years on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, she left the show to star in the made-for-television movie, &quot;To Love, Honor and Deceive&quot; and had a recurring guest role on the police drama &quot;High Incident&quot;, which was produced by Steven Spielberg. In November 1998, Marcil joined the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; cast as Gina Kincaid and remained with the show for one-and-a-half seasons. In 1999, she starred in two independent films: &quot;Nice Guys Sleep Alone&quot;, with Sean O&#x27;Bryan, and &quot;This Space Between Us&quot;, with Jeremy Sisto.

In 2001, she was initially cast to join &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;″s ninth season as a new series regular, Detective Carmen Olivera. However, after her first appearance in &quot;Johnny Got His Gold,” the show decided to redo the role and replaced Marcil with Jacqueline Obradors, as Detective Rita Ortiz. Marcil made one more cameo appearance, as Detective Olivera, in the 11th-season episode, &quot;Shear Stupidity.” 

From 2002 to 2003, she returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot;, as Brenda Barrett, garnering her a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003. Vanessa later joined the cast of the NBC drama &quot;Las Vegas&quot; as Sam Marquez, a casino host, where she remained on the show for five seasons until 2008. That same year, she became the host of Lifetime&#x27;s reality show &quot;&quot;, as well as making a three-episode guest appearance on the NBC show &quot;Lipstick Jungle&quot;.

In 2009, she starred in the Hallmark Channel movie &quot;The Nanny Express&quot; and in the Lifetime movie, &quot;One Hot Summer&quot;. In 2010, she was in the web series &quot;The Bannen Way,&quot; and in August 2010, after a seven-year absence, she made her return to &quot;General Hospital,&quot; remaining on the show for a year before her departure from the daytime series in July 2011. Marcil did reprise her role by making a guest appearance in April 2013, however, to commemorate the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

In 2014, she starred in the Hallmark channel movie, &quot;Stranded in Paradise&quot;, and in 2015, she joined the cast of the Pop reality series, &quot;Queens of Drama&quot;, about the lives of former soap-opera actresses attempting to pitch a pilot for a television network. In 2016, she starred in her latest Hallmark channel movie, &quot;The Convenient Groom&quot;.

==Personal life==
Marcil was married to actor Corey Feldman from 1989 to 1993. 

In 1999, Marcil started dating her &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; castmate, Brian Austin Green, whom she met on set. The two became engaged in July 2001 and had a son named Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green born in 2002. They planned to wed that year, but ended their relationship in 2003.

On July 11, 2010, Marcil married actor Carmine Giovinazzo in a private ceremony in New York City. In June 2011, the couple announced they were expecting their first child together; however, Marcil suffered a miscarriage, her second that year. Marcil filed for divorce in August 2012 on the basis of irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized in March 2013.

In April 2015, Marcil revealed on social media that she was engaged to a California Deputy Sheriff, MC Martin. On November 13, 2017, Marcil announced she was pregnant again. On January 9, 2018, she revealed that she was expecting a daughter, but on January 27, released a statement on Instagram stating she had miscarried for the seventh time.

Marcil&#x27;s father, Pete, died on September 14, 2017.

Marcil converted to Judaism.

<text>In Kiribati, there are no longer official administrative divisions but it is possible to divide Kiribati geographically into one isolated island and three archipelagos or island groups:

* Banaba – isolated island
* Gilbert Islands
* Line Islands
* Phoenix Islands

Kiribati was divided into six districts before gaining independence:

* Banaba
* Tarawa
* Northern Gilbert Islands
* Central Gilbert Island
* Southern Gilbert Islands
* Line Islands

Four of the former districts (including Tarawa) lie in the Gilbert Islands, where 90% of the country&#x27;s population lives. Only three of the Line Islands are inhabited, while the Phoenix Islands are uninhabited apart from Canton Island (20 people) and had no official representation. Banaba itself is sparsely inhabited now (330 people in 2020). There is also a representative non-elected of the Banabans relocated since 1945 to Rabi Island in the country of Fiji.

== Local councils ==
There are 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council(s). Two atolls have more than one local council: Tarawa has three and Tabiteuea has two, for a total of 24 local councils.

John Hilary Smith as the Governor, created the three councils of Tarawa, in 1972.

<doc id="690408" wikidata="Q765018" url="?curid=690408" title="Mandala (political model)">
<text>Maṇḍala is a Sanskrit word meaning &#x27;circle&#x27;. The mandala is a model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power distributed among Mueang or Kedatuan (principalities) in medieval Southeast Asian history, when local power was more important than the central leadership. The concept of the mandala balances modern tendencies to look for unified political power, e.g. the power of large kingdoms and nation states of later history – an inadvertent byproduct of 15th century advances in map-making technologies. In the words of O. W. Wolters who further explored the idea in 1982:

The map of earlier Southeast Asia which evolved from the prehistoric networks of small settlements and reveals itself in historical records was a patchwork of often overlapping mandalas.

It is employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations, such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized polity under a center of domination. It was adopted by 20th century European historians from ancient Indian political discourse as a means of avoiding the term &quot;state&quot; in the conventional sense. Not only did Southeast Asian polities, except Vietnam, not conform to Chinese and European views of a territorially defined state with fixed borders and a bureaucratic apparatus, but they diverged considerably in the opposite direction: the polity was defined by its centre rather than its boundaries, and it could be composed of numerous other tributary polities without undergoing administrative integration.

In some ways similar to the feudal system of Europe, states were linked in suzerain–tributary relationships.

==Terminology==
The term draws a comparison with the mandala of the Hindu and Buddhist worldview; the comparison emphasises the radiation of power from each power center, as well as the non-physical basis of the system.

Other metaphors such as S. J. Tambiah&#x27;s original idea of a &quot;galactic polity&quot; describe political patterns similar to the mandala. The historian Victor Lieberman prefers the &quot;solar polity&quot; metaphor, referencing the gravitational pull the sun exerts over the planets.

==History==
Historically, the main suzerain or overlord states were the Khmer Empire of Cambodia; Srivijaya of South Sumatra; the successive kingdoms of Mataram, Kediri, Singhasari and Majapahit of Java; the Ayutthaya Kingdom of Thailand; Champa and early Đại Việt. China occupies a special place in that the others often in turn paid tribute to China, although in practice the obligations imposed on the lesser kingdoms were minimal. The most notable tributary states were post-Angkor Cambodia, Lan Xang (succeeded by the Kingdom of Vientiane and Luang Prabang) and Lanna. Cambodia in the 18th century was described by the Vietnamese emperor Gia Long as &quot;an independent country that is slave of two&quot; (Chandler p. 119). The system was eventually ended by the arrival of the Europeans in the mid-19th century. Culturally, they introduced Western geographical practices, which assumed that every area was subject to one sovereign. Practically, the colonisation of French Indochina, Dutch East Indies, British Malaya and Burma brought pressure from the colonisers for fixed boundaries to their possessions. The tributary states were then divided between the colonies and Siam, which exercised much more centralised power but over a smaller area than thitherto.

The advent of Islam in the archipelago saw the application of this system which is still continued in the formation of the government, such as the formation of the 18th century Negeri Sembilan coalition which focused on Seri Menanti as a center flanked by four inner &quot;luak serambi&quot; and four outer districts. Another example is the post-Majapahit Islamic kingdoms in Java.

Historian Martin Stuart-Fox uses the term &quot;mandala&quot; extensively to describe the history of the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang as a structure of loosely held together mueang that disintegrated after Lan Xang&#x27;s conquest by Thailand starting in the 18th century.

Thai historian Sunait Chutintaranond made an important contribution to study of the mandala in Southeast Asian history by demonstrating that &quot;three assumptions responsible for the view that Ayudhya was a strong centralized state&quot; did not hold and that &quot;in Ayudhya the hegemony of provincial governors was never successfully eliminated.&quot;

==Obligations==

The obligations on each side of the relationship varied according to the strength of the relationship and the circumstances. In general, the tributary was obliged to pay &quot;bunga mas&quot;, a regular tribute of various valuable goods and slaves, and miniature trees of gold and silver (&quot;bunga mas dan perak&quot;). The overlord ruler reciprocated with presents often of greater value than those supplied by the tributary. However, the tributary also had to provide men and supplies when called on, most often in time of war. The main benefit to the tributary was protection from invasion by other powers, although as South East Asia historian Thongchai Winichakul notes, this was often &quot;mafia-like protection&quot; from the threats of the overlord himself. In some cases, the overlord also controlled the succession in the tributary, but in general interference with the tributary&#x27;s domestic affairs was minimal: he would retain his own army and powers of taxation, for example. In the case of the more tenuous relationships, the &quot;overlord&quot; might regard it as one of tribute, while the &quot;tributary&quot; might consider the exchange of gifts to be purely commercial or as an expression of goodwill (Thongchai p. 87).

==Personal relationships==

The emphasis on personal relationships was one of the defining characteristics of the mandala system. The tributary ruler was subordinate to the overlord ruler, rather than to the overlord state in the abstract. This had many important implications. A strong ruler could attract new tributaries, and would have strong relationships over his existing tributaries. A weaker ruler would find it harder to attract and maintain these relationships. This was put forward as one cause of the sudden rise of Sukhothai under Ramkhamhaeng, for example, and for its almost equally steep decline after his death (Wyatt, 45 and 48). The tributary ruler could repudiate the relationship and seek either a different overlord or complete independence. The system was non-territorial. The overlord was owed allegiance by the tributary ruler, or at most by the tributary&#x27;s main town, but not by all the people of a particular area. The tributary owner in turn had power either over tributary states further down the scale, or directly over &quot;his&quot; people, wherever they lived. No ruler had authority over unpopulated areas.

The personal relationship between overlord and subordinate rulers also defined the dynamic of relationship within a mandala. The relations between Dharmasetu of Srivijaya and Samaratungga of Sailendra, for instance, defined the succession of this dynastic family. Dharmasetu was the Srivijayan Maharaja overlord, while the house of Sailendra in Java is suggested to be related and was subscribed to Srivijayan mandala domination. After Samaratungga married Princess Tara, the daughter of Dharmasetu, Samaratungga became his successor and the house of Sailendra was promoted to become the dynastic lineage of later Srivijayan kings, and for a century the center of Srivijaya was shifted from Sumatra to Java.

==Non-exclusivity==
The overlord-tributary relationship was not necessarily exclusive. A state in border areas might pay tribute to two or three stronger powers. The tributary ruler could then play the stronger powers against one another to minimize interference by either one, while for the major powers the tributaries served as a buffer zone to prevent direct conflict between them. For example, the Malay kingdoms in Malay Peninsula, Langkasuka and Tambralinga earlier were subject to Srivijayan mandala, and in later periods contested by both Ayutthaya mandala in the north and Majapahit mandala in the south, before finally gaining its own gravity during Malacca Sultanate.

<text>The Cairo Metro (, lit. &quot;Cairo Tunnel Metro&quot; or   ) is a rapid transit system in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It was the first of the three full-fledged metro systems in Africa and the first in the Middle East to be constructed. It was opened in 1987 as Line 1 from Helwan to Ramses Square with a length of . As of 2013, the metro carried nearly 4 million passengers per day. As of 15 May 2024, the Cairo Metro has 84 stations of which 5 are transfer stations, with a total length of . The system consists of three operational lines numbered 1 to 3.

The Cairo Metro is owned by the National Authority for Tunnels. The lines use standard gauge ().

==Operations==

The middle two cars (4th and 5th) of each train have been reserved for women since 1989 (the 5th car becomes mixed-use after 21:00). There are blue signs (pink on the first and second lines) at every station that signify the position of these cars. These cars are used as an option for women who do not wish to ride with men in the same car; however, women can still ride other cars freely. This policy was introduced to the protection of women from sexual harassment by men.

Cairo Metro operates from 05:00 to 01:00 (except during Ramadan, when it operates from 05:00 to 02:00), with the remaining hours reserved for maintenance work.

The ticket price was £E1 for each journey, regardless of distance. The Ministry of Transportation agreed to double the ticket prices, starting from Friday 24 March 2017, costing £E2 for the normal ticket, £E1.5 for the ticket of the minor, £E1 for the special needs ticket after formerly costing £E1, £E0.75 and £E0.5, respectively. Again on 10 May 2018, the ministry of transportation agreed to raise the ticket prices to be £E3 for 9 stops, £E5 for 16 stops and £E7 for more than 16 stops. As of July 2020, 9 stops cost £E5, 16 stops cost £E7, and rides exceeding 16 stops cost £E10.

==Network==

===Line 1===

Line 1 (blue) is the oldest line of the Cairo Metro and the first metro to open in Africa and the Middle East, with its first segment having opened in 1987. The line is long and serves 35 stations. This line carries trains with 3 units (9 train cars), which have a headway of 3.5 to 4 minutes, and a maximum speed of . The line can carry 60,000 passengers per hour in each direction.

Line 1 has a train driving simulator supplied by Transurb Technirail that won the international tender issued by Cairo Metro in 2011.

===Line 2===

Line 2 (red) is the second line of the Cairo Metro, first opening in 1996. The line is long, of which are in tunnels. It serves 20 stations, of which 12 are underground. It is mostly in the bored tunnel, with two exceptions: a short section at the northern end approaching Shubra El Kheima which is elevated, and a section just south of this by cut-and-cover. Line 2 uses the third rail electrification system instead of the overhead line used in the first line. The communication extension for line 2 was provided by Alcatel in 2005.

The minimum headway for the line is 2.7 to 3 minutes.

Line 2 has a simulator installed in Shubra since 2002 which was delivered by French company CORYS.

The first tunnel to be built under the Nile River carries Line 2 across the river.

===Line 3===

Line 3 (green) is the newest line. Its first section opened in 2012. It operates from Rod El-Farag Corridor and Cairo University to Adly Mansour, where it connects to the Cairo Light Rail Transit. Eventually, it will be extended to Cairo International Airport. The line crosses under the two branches of the River Nile, as does Line 2. The total length of the line will be approximately , most of which are in the bored tunnel, and will be implemented in four phases.

Phase 1 from Attaba station to Abbassia station opened in 21 February 2012, with five stations and a total length of . Phase 2 to Al Ahram Station was opened in 7 May 2014, by Adly Mansour, with four additional stations and an added length of , for a total length of . Phase 4A from Al Ahram to El Shams Club opened in 15 June 2019 (except for Heliopolis Square station which opened later that year). Phase 3A from Attaba station to Kit Kat station opened in October 2022. Phase 3B from Kit Kat station to Rod El-Farag Corridor station opened in January 2024, adding six more stations and . and began revenue service on 1 January 2024. Phase 3C from Kit Kat to Cairo University was opened in 15 May 2024.

==History==

===Background===

As the biggest and most densely populated megacity in Africa and the Middle East, Greater Cairo had a strong case for a metro. In 1987 that population stood at 10 million residents, not counting the two million or so commuters who came into Cairo every day to work. The capacity of Cairo&#x27;s public transport infrastructure was around 20,000 passengers/hour, which increased to 60,000 after the construction of the metro.

===Proposed plans===
The idea of a metro was first proposed in the 1930s by engineer Saiyed Abdel Wahed of the Egyptian Railway Authority, however, the idea did not progress. Following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, there was renewed interest in the idea. In 1954 French experts made a report about the future of the transportation in Egypt. They proposed a metro encompassing two lines, one long line connecting Bab al-Louq and Ismailia and a second line connecting Boulaq and Abou al-Ela Castle. They also proposed that there should be one company in charge of all transportation systems.

Later on, multiple experts came to Egypt regarding that project: Soviet experts in 1956, Japanese experts in 1960 and French experts in 1962, which concluded the following:
The creation of a metro system with multiple lines. The first is a line connecting Helwan with El-Marg going under Kasr el Eini street and Ramses Street. The second line would be from Sayyidah Zaynab Mosque to Shobra going under Downtown Cairo and would be long. The third would be from Giza to Abbaseya and would be long. The fourth would be from Al Awqaf to the Castle and would be long.

In 1964, British experts advised the creation of a metro line from Bab El Louk to Shubra. In 1966 Japanese experts advised the creation of a lane between Helwan and El Marg and another one going through Mohandiseen, Heliopolis and 26 of July Street, for a total of . Lastly, in 1969, the government approved the need for a study showing the needed capacity for Cairo&#x27;s transportation system. The Egyptian Ministry of Transport issued an international tender for the creation of the study. Eight companies applied and the French company SOFRETU won the tender on 20 September 1970. The study was finished in 1973 and included mainly the study of the population development in Cairo and its needs for transportation capacity in 1980, 1985 and 1990. It concluded the necessity for three lines in greater Cairo to solve the transportation problem.
The first line would use the already available railways (Helwan-Bab El luk and Al Laymoun Bridge-El Marg) and connect them through a metro. It would be in total long. The second line would be and connect Shubra El-Kheima and Bulaq going through Ramses Street and Tahrir Square. The third line would go from El Darasa to Imbaba and would be in total long.

The priority for the project was the first line which would reduce 30% of the daily transport to and from Cairo and would incorporate pre-existing rail infrastructure. The detailed study of the construction took 6 years from 1975 to 1981. A tender was made for the construction of the metro and the Egyptian-French company Entra Nevra Arabco won it and had the task of constructing the metro system.

===Construction works===
The construction of Line 1 started in 1982 after the French government agreed on giving Egypt the necessary loan. The first section was opened in 27 September 1987 and the line was completed in 1989 connecting Helwan with El Marg and consisting of 34 stations with a total length of 42.5 km of which 4.7 km underground. In 1999, New El Marg station was added to the northern end of the line, bringing its total length to 44 km. Helwan University station was built between Wadi Houf and Ain Helwan stations.

Cairo&#x27;s metro network was greatly expanded in the mid-1990s with the building of Line 2, from Shoubra El Kheima to Cairo University, with an extension to Giza. The line includes the first tunnel under the Nile. The construction of the line was finished in October 2000, and it was later extended to El Mounib.

==Proposed lines==
===Line 4 (October-Oasis Highway - the Police Academy)===

Line 4 is planned to run from Haram District to the New Cairo district, connecting Greater Cairo from West to East. It will cross the two branches of the Nile river and have a total length of . 
Construction began in 2024 for completion in 2028.

Phase 1 (west) of the project will run from &quot;El-Malek El-Saleh Station&quot; (Interchange with Line 1) to the &quot;October-Oasis Highway Station&quot; with a total length of 18 km, passing through &quot;Giza Railway Station&quot; (Interchange with Line 2); the original plan for phase 1 was for it to start from &quot;El-Malek El-Saleh Station&quot; and end at the &quot;Grand Egyptian Museum Station&quot; with a total length of 10 km, but the Ministry of Roads &amp; Transportation decided to extend the Line in their efforts to further connect the Governorate of 6 October to the Greater Cairo Area; Phase 1 also includes the plan to connect the end of Line 4 to the suburbs of 6 October mainly through executing &quot;The October 6th Tram system&quot; (The &quot;O6T&quot;) which will be by using a tram-train system supplied with the Alstom Regio-Citadis trams. This phase will have 15 stations to be constructed with a duration of 6.5 years. Phase 1 stations will be equipped with an automatic fare collection system and platform screen doors, and will include elevators for the use of disabled passengers.
Phase 1 bidding was postponed until May 2015 to enable Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to complete the feasibility study and to resolve other problems with the construction starting by 2015 or 2016 according to Ismail El-Nagdy, Chairman of the National Authority for Tunnels with Japan International Cooperation Agency financing a $1.2 billion loan, while Egyptian government would cover the remainder, $2.4 billion.

Phase 2 will begin from &quot;El-Malek El-Saleh Station&quot;, passing east through Magra El-Oyoun street and Salah El-Din Citadel in Salah Salem street and ending at the &quot;6th District Station&quot; (beginning of Nasr City district) with a completion date set at October 2018.

Phase 3 will begin from &quot;6th District Station&quot; and end at &quot;Makram Ebeid Station&quot;, following &quot;Mustafa El-Nahas street&quot; in bored tunnels under the existing old tram system, and ultimately deconstructing the old railway and paving its right-of-way (increasing the street by two lanes in each direction, which is critically needed to lighten the traffic congestion in the area). This phase has a completion date set for October 2019. Mitsubishi was the only company to submit an offer on a tender for 64 trains in the third and fourth phases of the project. The offer was accepted in October 2018.

Phase 4, the final phase, will begin from &quot;Makram Ebeid Station&quot; with bored tunnels following Doctor Hassan El-Sherif street and Ahmed El-Zomor street, ending at &quot;Police Academy Station&quot; near the Ring Road.

===The New Cairo Monorail===
This project was first proposed by private investors as a plan to connect &quot;Line 3&quot; with &quot;Line 4&quot;, through a route that is mostly parallel to the Ring Road&#x27;s eastern arc, therefore covering New Cairo from north to south starting at the Cairo International Airport and ending at the beginning of the Cairo-Ain Sokhna Highway.

In August 2016, a different monorail project was under discussion, connecting 6 October city with other western parts of Greater Cairo. The line was expected to be long, cost $1.5 billion, and be completed by 2018.

A contract was signed in August 2019 with Bombardier Transportation, Orascom Construction, and Arab Contractors for $4.5 billion to build and operate the two monorail lines. The first will run 54 km from eastern Cairo to the new administrative capital. The second will run 42 km from 6 October City to Giza.

===Qalyub Line 2 extension===
As of December 2017, Spokesperson for the Egyptian National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) said that there are plans to extend Line 2 7 kilometers to the north from Shubra Al-Kheima station to end at Qalyub station due to the increasing traffic in north Cairo entrances, He also said that bidding will be held in February 2018 and the winner will be revealed mid-2018. The station will be an at-grade station built parallel to the train railway, bridges will be built to divert traffic from the Metro route.

===Cairo International Airport Line 3 extension===
Line 3 Phase 4C is proposed to start from Heliopolis station passing through Al-Hegaz Square and Military Academy area to Sheraton District and after ending at Cairo International Airport. If built, it would have five tunnel stations. There is no proposed completion date for this phase.

===Long-term plans===

A transportation study of the Greater Cairo region was completed in 1999. It recommended the implementation of a six-line system consisting of lines 1, 2 and 3 (existing); and lines 4, 5 and 6. The completed Metro Network would be capable of serving most of the densely populated areas in the Greater Cairo region, which was much in need of a comprehensive mass transit system. The plans include interchange stations between the six metro lines and would also provides interchange facilities with existing main railway stations, the airport, and bus stations.

The six planned metro lines aim to meet the transportation demands of the Greater Cairo area up to the year 2032. However, the actual construction and implementation schedule will be restricted by available funding, and the timetable will likely slip.

Line 5 would be a half-circular line connecting lines 1-4 in northern Cairo, running from Nasr City in the east to Port Said Street and Shubra El Kheima in the west. It would have a length of , entirely within bored tunnels. It would intersect Line 1 at &quot;Helmiet el-Zaitoun station&quot;, Line 2 at &quot;El-Khalafawy station&quot;, Line 3 at &quot;Haroun station&quot;, and Line 4 at &quot;Al-Wafaa we al-Amal station&quot;.

Line 6 would be a north-south line, from Shubra in the north to the Maadi and Helwan districts in the south. It would run from &quot;Ataba Station&quot; through &quot;El Kalaa street&quot; in bored tunnels to &quot;Salah Eldin Citadel Station&quot; (Interchange with &quot;Line 4&quot;) and move on from there to both districts via bored tunnels using the existing route &quot;El-Mahager Railway&quot; as a guide through both Maadi and Helwan. This Line has a length of . It would intersect Line 1 at &quot;Ghamra station&quot;, Line 3 at &quot;Bab al-Sharia station&quot;, Line 4 at &quot;Amr Ibn al-Ase station&quot;, and Line 5 at &quot;Sawah station&quot;.

<doc id="690419" wikidata="Q1342205" url="?curid=690419" title="Administrative divisions of Peru">
<text>The administrative divisions of Peru have changed from time to time since the nation gained independence from Spain in the early 19th century. The old territorial subdivisions have split or merged due to several reasons, the most common ones being the need for decentralization and population increase, especially in Lima.

==History==
Peru was divided into 24 departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;; singular: &quot;departamento&quot;) until the creation of the regions in 2002. These regions are governed by Regional Governments. Many people still use the old &quot;departamentos&quot; term when referring to the current regions of Peru, although it is now obsolete. The departments were identical to today&#x27;s regions, with the exception of two new regions (Callao and Lima). Before the 2002 changeover, the province of Lima (which is basically the city of Lima) was part of the Lima department, and the city of Callao had the special status of &quot;Provincia Constitucional&quot; (constitutional province). When the regionalization law was passed, the Callao region was created from the former constitutional province, and the province of Lima separated from the rest of the Lima department, which in turn came to form the new Lima Region. A failed attempt to divide the country into twelve autonomous regions had previously been made during the 1980s under the government of Alan García.

==Districts==
For a new district to be legally established, a 1982 law requires a minimum number of residents to live in the area: 3,500 if it is located in the rainforest, 4,000 in the Andes highlands, and 10,000 in the coastal area.

In the dry Andean area, many districts have fewer than 3,500 inhabitants. In some cases, their populations have decreased in comparison to the days when they were founded. Districts that are located at very high altitudes tend to be scarcely populated. These districts are usually large in area but have little available level land for use. Many basic government services do not reach all residents of these districts due to their difficult geography. Many such districts lack the financial means to govern their whole jurisdictions and often have high emigration rates.

A similar pattern can be observed in many districts located in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest. Once important settlements created during the era of colonization, they now do not offer much space for agriculture. Deeper into the jungle, the districts of the &quot;selva baja&quot; (lower jungle) have higher populations living in geographically large districts. Districts located outside the former colonized area have very low populations, which are entirely composed of native Amazonian tribes.

All over the country, many districts have higher populations than the minimum required by law. This is true of the colonized areas of the rainforest and the northern Andes, as well as in the southern Andes from Huancayo to the shores of Lake Titicaca, which is the historical heartland of the Peruvian highlands. These districts are old centers of civilization; they tend to be smaller in area, with high population densities since pre-Hispanic times.

Districts in the Chala (coastal area) tend to be mid-sized, except in low-density areas such as the Sechura Desert and part of the southern coast. All have gained large populations due to emigration from other regions of the country, which has turned the Peruvian coast into the country&#x27;s main economic powerhouse.

Districts with a population of more than 10,000 inhabitants should ideally be subdivided, particularly if they are also large in area, as is the case in part of the Amazon rainforest. Settlement can happen quickly and boundaries of districts are often not modified, except in large urban areas. This is less of a problem on the coast, where communication is easier. However, reaching large populations remain a problem in this area.

==Current division==

Peru&#x27;s territory, according to the Regionalization Law, which was passed on November 18, 2002, is divided into 26 units: 25 regions (&quot;regiones&quot;; singular: &quot;región&quot;) and the Lima Province. The regions are subdivided into provinces (&quot;provincias&quot;), which are composed of districts (&quot;distritos&quot;). There are 196 provinces and 1,891 districts in Peru.

The Lima Province, located in the central coast of the country, is unique in that it does not belong to any of the twenty-five regions. (The city of Lima, which is the nation&#x27;s capital, is located in this province.)

Callao is also its own region, containing only one province, the Constitutional Province of Callao.

<doc id="690428" wikidata="Q5152983" url="?curid=690428" title="Committee for the Prevention of Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount">
<text>The Committee for the Prevention of Destruction of Antiquities on the Temple Mount is a group of archaeologists, intellectuals and other prominent individuals in Israel formed in response to concerns about damage to antiquities from excavations at the Temple Mount and alleged attempts by the Jerusalem Waqf to remove archaeological evidence of a Jewish Temple at the Temple Mount.

==History==
The committee was founded in January 2000 by archaeologists Eilat Mazar of Hebrew University, Gabriel Barkay, and other prominent individuals in response to a protruding bulge discovered in 2000 in the Temple Mount&#x27;s southwest corner.

The committee has alleged that the Jerusalem Waqf attempted to remove archaeological evidence that a Jewish temple ever stood at the Temple Mount by opening a mosque at Solomon&#x27;s Stables in 1999. To monitor the Waqf&#x27;s construction at the site in the early 2000s, the committee hired aircraft to take aerial photos and monitor for construction progress.

For decades, the committee pushed for efforts to analyze dirt and rubble dug up during Muslim construction at the Temple Mount site, which Muslim and Jordanian authorities have rejected. Between 2004 and 2017, volunteers associated with the committee went through the dirt removed by the Waqf from the site during construction, discovering half a million pieces of rubble from the First Temple and Second Temple eras. The committee filed a petition to the Israel Supreme Court in 2004 to prevent the Israeli government and Jerusalem Waqf from removing 3,000 tons of dirt from the Temple Mount site. Justice Jacob Turkel granted the group&#x27;s petition. In 2005, the group publicly criticized the Israeli government for not stopping Waqf construction on the Temple Mount.

In 2018, Zachi Dvira, on behalf of the committee, shared video footage of a multi-date &quot;beautification project&quot; by Muslim volunteers removing earth and stones from atop the Temple Mount, which he claimed were dumped by the Waqf during unauthorized excavations since the early 2000s. Archaeologists had been prevented by Israeli and Muslim authorities from examining the contents.

Members come from a broad swath of Israeli society, from archaeologists to members of the security establishment and politicians. These include former mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek, poet Haim Gouri, and the novelists Amos Oz and A. B. Yehoshua.

<doc id="690437" wikidata="Q981912" url="?curid=690437" title="John of Nikiû">
<text>John of Nikiû (fl. 680–690) was an Egyptian Coptic bishop of Nikiû (Pashati) in the Nile Delta and general administrator of the monasteries of Upper Egypt in 696. He is the author of a &quot;Chronicle&quot; extending from Adam to the end of the Muslim conquest of Egypt. John of Nikiû&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; contains important historical details otherwise unknown.

==Life==
There are two main sources for John&#x27;s life. The first is the &quot;History of the Patriarchs&quot; by Severus, Bishop of Al-Ashmunyn (Heliopolis). This draws on two originally independent biographies that mention John: those of Pope Isaac of Alexandria (690-692 CE) and Pope Simeon I of Alexandria (692-700 CE). The second source is the Life of Isaac of Alexandria composed by John&#x27;s successor as bishop of Nikiu, Mena of Nikiu, between 697 and 700 CE.

According to the &quot;History of the Patriarchs&quot;, John lived under the Patriarchs John III, Isaac, and Simeon. The Patriarch Simeon removed John from office for having disciplined a monk, presumably guilty of leading other monks into removing a nun from her monastery&#x27;s cell in Wadi Habib and sleeping with her, so severely that the monk died ten days later.

==Chronicle==
The original editor of this text, Zotenberg, argued that John of Nikiû&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; was originally written mostly in Greek, theorising that some of the name forms indicate that John wrote the sections concerning Egypt in Coptic. Scholarly opinion has shifted, however, to the belief that this chronicle was probably written in Coptic. The work survives only in a Ge&#x27;ez translation. In 1602, an Arabic translation of the original was made. Sections of the text are obviously corrupted with accidental omissions. Most notably, a passage covering thirty years (from 610 to 640) is missing. The narrative, especially the earlier sections up until the reign of Constantine, has many obvious historical errors. These may be due to mistakes by the copyist, or to a policy of deliberate negligence towards Pagan history. There are also many instances of myth and less a reliance on pure history, for instance, Julius Caesar&#x27;s mother being cut open to birth him, resulting in a Caesarian section. This is a fable made up by later historians and bears no evidence to historical fact. 

John&#x27;s view of the earliest periods of history is informed by sources such as Sextus Julius Africanus and John Malalas. The &quot;Chronicle&quot; is most noteworthy for its passages dealing with the early 7th century. John covers in detail the revolt of the Thracian armies in 602 and the subsequent overthrow of the Emperor Maurice by the usurper Phocas. His account adds considerably to our knowledge of the reign of Phocas and particularly to the successful revolt against him begun at Carthage by Heraclius. Unfortunately, the section dealing with the climactic Persian wars waged by Heraclius is not extant.

Perhaps the most important section of John&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle&quot; is that which deals with the invasion and conquest of Egypt by the Muslim armies of Amr ibn al-Aas. Though probably not an eyewitness, John was most likely of the generation immediately following the conquest, and the Chronicle provides the only near-contemporary account. John describes the major events of Amr&#x27;s campaign, such as the taking of the Babylon Fortress and the capture of Alexandria. Though the timeline is occasionally confusing, its narrative details are often vivid.

The main English translation of John&#x27;s Chronicle is that of R.H. Charles. In it, John vividly records the fear that gripped Egypt during the Muslim invasions: Then a panic fell on all the cities of Egypt, and all their inhabitants took to flight, and made their way to Alexandria, abandoning all their possessions and wealth and cattle. He also makes several mentions of alleged atrocities committed against the Copts by the Arabs: And these Ishmaelites came and slew without mercy the commander of the troops and all his companions. And forthwith they compelled the city to open its gates, and they put to the sword all that surrendered, and they spared none, whether old men, babe or woman. Also: And thereupon the Moslem made their entry into Nakius, and took possession, and finding no soldiers (to offer resistance), they proceeded to put to the sword all whom they found in the streets and in the churches, men, women, and infants, and they showed mercy to none. John also reports the prohibitive new taxes placed on the native population. In some cases, the taxes were so burdensome that families were forced to sell their children into slavery. He also admonishes Egyptians who abandoned Christianity in favour of Islam.

Writing from a miaphysite point of view — at odds with the dyophysite Christology affirmed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 — John describes the Islamic invasion of his homeland as divine punishment for the Chalcedonian beliefs which held sway in the Byzantine Empire. At the close of his &quot;Chronicle,&quot; John describes the despair felt by the conquered Alexandrians, writing: None could recount the mourning and lamentation which took place in that city...And they had none to help them, and God destroyed their hopes and delivered the Christians into the hands of their enemies. The account ends with the faith that divine retribution would still befall his people&#x27;s enemies: But the strong beneficence of God will put to shame those who grieve us, and He will make His love for man to triumph over our sins, and bring to naught the evil purposes of those who afflict us, who would not that the King of Kings and Lord of Lords should reign over them, (even) Jesus Christ our true God. As for those wicked slaves, He will destroy them in evil fashion: as saith the holy Gospel: &#x27;As for Mine enemies who would not that I should reign over them, bring them unto Me.&#x27;

<doc id="690453" wikidata="Q1049777" url="?curid=690453" title="Thai literature">
<text>Thai literature is the literature of the Thai people, almost exclusively written in the Thai language (although different scripts other than Thai may be used). Most of imaginative literary works in Thai, before the 19th century, were composed in poetry. Prose was reserved for historical records, chronicles, and legal documents. Consequently, the poetical forms in the Thai language are both numerous and highly developed. The corpus of Thailand&#x27;s pre-modern poetic works is large. Thus, although many literary works were lost with the sack of Ayutthaya in 1767, Thailand still possesses a large number of epic poems or long poetic tales —some with original stories and some with stories drawn from foreign sources. There is thus a sharp contrast between the Thai literary tradition and that of other East Asian literary traditions, such as Chinese and Japanese, where long poetic tales are rare and epic poems are almost non-existent. The Thai classical literature exerted a considerable influence on the literature of neighboring countries in mainland Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia and Burma.

==The development of Thai classical literature==
===Origins===
As speakers of the Tai language family, the Siamese share literary origins with other Tai speakers in mainland Southeast Asia. It is possible that the early literature of the Thai people may have been written in Chinese.
However, no historical record of the Siamese thus far refers to these earlier literature. The Thai poetical tradition was originally based on indigenous poetical forms such as &quot;rai&quot; (ร่าย), &quot;khlong&quot; (โคลง), &quot;kap&quot; (กาพย์), and &quot;klon&quot; (กลอน). Some of these poetical forms—notably &quot;Khlong&quot; - have been shared between the speakers of Tai languages since ancient time (before the emergence of Siam). An early representative work of &quot;Khlong&quot; poetry is the epic poem &quot;Thao Hung Thao Cheuang&quot;, a shared epic story, about a Khmer noble warrior in mainland Southeast Asia.

===Indian influence on the Siamese language===

Through Buddhism&#x27;s and Hindu&#x27;s influence, a variety of &quot;Chanda&quot; prosodic meters were received via Ceylon. Since the Thai language is mono-syllabic, a huge number of loan words from Sanskrit and Pali are needed to compose in these classical Sanskrit meters. According to B.J. Terwiel, this process occurred with an accelerated pace during the reign of King Boromma-trailokkanat (1448-1488) who reformed Siam&#x27;s model of governance by turning the Siamese polity into an empire under the mandala feudal system. The new system demanded a new imperial language for the ruling noble classes. This literary influence changed the course of the Thai or Siamese language—setting it apart from other &quot;Tai&quot; languages—by increasing the number of Sanskrit and Pali words and imposing the demand on the Thai to develop a writing system that preserved the orthography of Sanskrit words for literary purposes. By the 15th century, the Thai language had evolved into a distinctive medium along with a nascent literary identity of a new nation. It allowed Siamese poets to compose in different poetical styles and mood—from playful and humorous rhymed verses, to romantic and elegant &quot;khlong&quot; and to polished and imperious &quot;chan&quot; prosodies which were modified from classical Sanskrit meters. Thai poets experimented with these different prosodic forms, producing innovative &quot;hybrid&quot; poems such as &quot;Lilit&quot; (—an interleave of &quot;khlong&quot; and &quot;kap&quot; or &quot;rai&quot; verses), or &quot;Kap hor Klong&quot; ( - a series of &quot;khlong&quot; poems each of which is enveloped by &quot;kap&quot; verses). The Thai thus developed a keen mind and a keen ear for poetry. To maximize this new literary medium, however, a rather intensive classical education in Pali and Sanskrit was required. This made &quot;serious poetry&quot; an occupation of the noble classes. However, B.J. Terwiel notes, citing a 17th-century Thai text book &quot;Jindamanee&quot;, that scribes and common Siamese men, too, were encouraged to learn basic Pali and Sanskrit terms for career advancement. Thai poetry and literary production came to dominate the learned literature of the Tai-speaking world from the mid-Ayutthaya period until the 20th century. As J. Layden observed, in &quot;On the Languages and Literature of the Indo-Chinese Nations&quot; (1808):
===&quot;Ramakien&quot;===

Most countries in Southeast Asia share an Indianised culture. Thai literature was heavily influenced by the Indian culture and Buddhist-Hindu ideology since the time it first appeared in the 13th century. Thailand&#x27;s national epic is a version of the Ramayana called the &quot;Ramakien&quot;, received from the Khmer people through the Lavo Kingdom. The importance of the Ramayana epic in Thailand is due to the Thai&#x27;s adoption of the Hindu religio-political ideology of kingship, as embodied by the Lord Rama. The former Siamese capital, Ayutthaya, was named after the holy city of Ayodhya, the city of Lord Rama. All Thai kings have been referred to as &quot;Rama&quot; to the present day.

The mythical tales and epic cycle of &quot;Ramakien&quot; provide the Siamese with a rich and perennial source for dramatic materials. The royal court of Ayutthaya developed classical dramatic forms of expression called &quot;khon&quot; and &quot;lakhon&quot;. &quot;Ramakien&quot; played a great role in shaping these dramatic arts. During the Ayutthaya period, &quot;khon&quot;, or a dramatized version of Ramakien, was classified as &quot;lakhon nai&quot; or a theatrical performance reserved for aristocratic audiences. A French diplomat, Simon de La Loubère, witnessed and documented it in 1687, during a formal diplomatic mission sent by King Louis XIV. The Siamese drama and classical dance later spread throughout mainland Southeast Asia and influenced the art in neighboring countries, including Burma&#x27;s own version of Ramayana, Cambodia, and Laos.

A number of versions of the Ramakien epic were lost in the destruction of Ayutthaya in 1767. Three versions currently exist. One of these was prepared under the supervision (and partly written by) King Rama I. His son, Rama II, rewrote some parts for khon drama. The main differences from the original are an extended role for the monkey god Hanuman and the addition of a happy ending. Many of popular poems among the Thai nobles are also based on Indian stories. One of the most famous is Anirut Kham Chan which is based on an ancient Indian story of Prince Anirudha.

==Literature of the Sukhothai period==
The Thai alphabet emerged as an independent writing system around 1283. One of the first work composed in it was the inscription of King Ram Khamhaeng () or Ram Khamhaeng stele, composed in 1292, which serves both as the King&#x27;s biography and as the Kingdom&#x27;s chronicle.

The influence of Theravada Buddhism is shown in most pre-modern Thai literary works. &quot;Traibhumikatha&quot; or &quot;Trai Phum Phra Ruang&quot; (, &quot;The Three Worlds according to King Ruang&quot;), one of the earliest Thai cosmological treatise, was composed around the mid-14th century. It is acknowledged to be one of the oldest traditional works of Thai literature. The &quot;Trai Phum Phra Ruang&quot; explains the composition of the universe, which, according to the Theravada Buddhist Thai, consists of three different &quot;worlds&quot; or levels of existence and their respective mythological inhabitants and creatures. The year of composition was dated at 1345 CE, whereas the authorship is traditionally attributed to the then designated heir to the throne and later King LiThai () of Sukhothai. &quot;Traibhumikatha&quot; is a work of high scholarly standard. In composing it, King Lithai had to consult over 30 Buddhist treatises, including Tripitaka () and Milinda Panha. It is acclaimed to be the first research dissertation in Thai literary history.

==Literature of the Ayutthaya period==
One of the representative works of the early Ayutthaya period is Lilit Ongkan Chaeng Nam (), an incantation in verse to be uttered before the gathering of courtiers, princes of foreign land, and representatives of vassal states at the taking of the oath of allegiance ceremony. It was a ritual to promote loyalty and close domestic and foreign alliances.

===&quot;Lilit&quot; poetry===
A &quot;lilit&quot; () is a literary format which interleaves poetic verses of different metrical nature to create a variety of pace and cadence in the music of the poetry. The first Lilit poem to appear is &quot;Lilit Yuan Phai&quot; ( &#x27;the defeat of the Yuan&#x27;, composed during the early-Ayutthaya period (c. 1475 CE). &quot;Yuan Phai&quot; is the Thai equivalent of the Song of Roland. It is an epic war poem of about 1180 lines, narrating the key events of the war between King Borommatrailokkanat (1448–1488) and King Tilokaraj of Lan Na, and providing a victory ode for the King of Siam. The importance of &quot;Yuan Phai&quot; is not limited to just being the oldest surviving example of Lilit poetry. It serves also as an important historical account of the war between Siam and Lan Na, as well as an evidence of the Siamese&#x27;s theory of kingship that was evolving during the reign of Borommatrailokkanat.

Another famous piece of lilit poetry is &quot;Lilit Phra Lo&quot; () (c. 1500), a tragico-romantic epic poem that employed a variety of poetical forms. &quot;Phra Lo&quot; is roughly 2,600 lines in length. It is one of the major &quot;lilit&quot; compositions still surviving today and is considered to be the best among them. &quot;Phra Lo&quot; is considered to be one of the earliest Thai poems that evoke sadness and tragic emotions. The story ends with the tragic death of the eponymic hero and two beautiful princesses with whom he was in love. The erotic theme of the poem also made &quot;Phra Lo&quot; controversial among the Siamese noble classes for generations. While its author is unknown, &quot;Phra Lo&quot; is believed to have been written around the beginning of King Ramathibodi II&#x27;s reign (1491-1529), and certainly not later than 1656, since a part of it was recited in a Thai textbook composed in the King Narai&#x27;s reign. The plot probably came from a folk tale in the north of Thailand. Its tragic story has universal appeal and its composition is considered to be a high achievement under the Thai poetic tradition.

===Maha-chat Kham Luang: the &quot;Great Birth&quot; sermon===
The third major work of this period is &quot;Mahajati Kham Luang&quot; or &quot;Mahachat Kham Luang&quot; (), the Thai epic account of the &quot;Great Birth&quot; (maha-jati) of Vessantara Bodhisatta, the last final life before he became the Buddha. &quot;Mahachat&quot; was written in the style of the Buddhist chant (ร่าย) combining Pali verses with Thai poetical narrative. In 1492, King Borommatrailokkanat authorized a group of scholars to write a poem based on the story of Vessantara Jataka, believed to be the greatest of Buddha&#x27;s incarnations. Their joint effort was this great work and the precedence of reciting Maha, the Great Life, was then established. &quot;Mahachat&quot; has traditionally been divided into 13 books. Six of them were lost during the sack of Ayutthaya and were ordered to be recomposed in 1815. There are many versions of &quot;Mahachat&quot; in Thailand today.

===Royal panegyrics===
The royal panegyric is a prominent genre in Thai poetry, possibly influenced by the Praśasti genre in Sanskrit. Passages in praise of kings appear in inscriptions from the Sukhothai kingdom. Praise of the king is a large element in Yuan Phai, a 15th-century war poem. The first work framed and titled specifically as a royal panegyric was the &quot;Eulogy of King Prasat Thong&quot; about King Narai’s father and predecessor, probably composed early in King Narai’s reign. The &quot;Eulogy of King Narai&quot;, composed around 1680, includes a description of the Lopburi palace and an account of an elephant hunt.

=== Nirat: The Siamese tradition of parting and longing poetry===
The &quot;nirat&quot; () is a lyrical genre, popular in Thai literature, which can be translated as &#x27;farewell poetry&#x27;. The core of the poetry is a travel description, but essential is the longing for the absent lover. The poet describes his journey through landscapes, towns, and villages, but he regularly interrupts his description to express his feelings for and thoughts of the abandoned lover. Nirat poetry probably originated from the Northern Thai people. &quot;Nirat Hariphunchai&quot; (1637) is traditionally believed to be the first Nirat to appear in the Thai language. However, the Thai &quot;nirat&quot; tradition could prove to be much older, depending on whether &quot;Khlong Thawathotsamat&quot; could be dated back to the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat (1431-1488). Siamese poets composed Nirat with different poetical device. During the Ayutthaya period, poets liked to compose Nirat poems using &quot;&quot;khlong&quot;&quot; (โคลง) and &quot;&quot;kap&quot;&quot; (กาพย์) metrical variety. Prince Thammathibet (1715-1755) () was a renowned Nirat poet whose works are still extant today.
Other representatives of this genus are Si Prat (1653-1688) () and Sunthorn Phu (1786-1855) (). Since nirat poems record what the poet sees or experiences during his journey, they represent an information source for the Siamese culture as well as history in the premodern time. This poetical genre later spread, first to Myanmar in the late 18th Century, and then Cambodia in the mid 19th century, at the time when Cambodia was heavily influenced by the Siamese culture. Famous poems in the &quot;nirat&quot; genre during the Ayutthaya period are:
* &quot;Khlong Thawathotsamāt&quot; (c. 1450?) (; &quot;the Twelve-Month Song&quot;): &quot;Thawathotsamat&quot; is a 1,037-line nirat poem in &quot;khlong&quot; meter. It is believed to be composed by a group of royal poets rather than by one man. It is formerly thought to be composed during the reign of King Narai, but in fact the language of this poem suggests a much older period. The large number of Sanskrit words in &quot;Thawathotsamat&quot; suggests that it was composed perhaps in the reign of King Borommatrailokkanat (1431-1488) when such literary style was common. &quot;Thawathotsamat&quot; is also an important work of Thai literature because it records the knowledge about specific traditions and norms practiced by Thai people in each month of a year. &quot;Thawathotsamat&quot; is also unique among the &quot;nirat&quot; genre of poetry because the poet(s) do not travel anywhere but they nonetheless express the longing and sadness that each month of separation from their loved ones brings.
* &quot;Khlong Nirat Hariphunchai&quot; (; account of a journey from Chiang Mai to Wat Phra That Hariphunchai in Lamphun, possibly dated to 1517/8. The royal author laments over his separation from a beloved named Si Thip.
* &quot;Khlong Kamsuan Sīprāt&quot; (; &quot;the mournful song of Sīprāt&quot;) by Sīprāt: A nirat poem composed in &quot;khlong dàn&quot; () meter.
* &quot;Kap Hor Khlong Nirat Thansōk&quot; (; &quot;a nirat at Thansōk stream in kap-hor-khlong verse&quot;) (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet: a nirat poem composed in a special style of &quot;kap hor khlong&quot; - where each of the &quot;khlong&quot; poems is enclosed in &quot;kap&quot; verses. This is a rare example of a highly polished and stately style of Thai poetry. &quot;Nirat Thansōk&quot; is 152-stanza long (1,022 lines).
* &quot;Kap Hor Khlong Praphat Than-Thongdang&quot; (; &quot;a royal visit at Than-Thongdang stream in kap-hor-khlong verse&quot;) (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet. Another rare example of &quot;kap hor khlong&quot; genre. Only 108 stanzas of this poem have been found. The other half seems to have been lost.

===The Siamese epic &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot;===
In the Ayutthaya period, folktales also flourished. One of the most famous folktales is the story of &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; (), referred to in Thailand simply as &quot;Khun Phaen&quot;, which combines the elements of romantic comedy and heroic adventures, ending in the tragic death of one of the main protagonists. The epic of &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; (KCKP) revolves around &quot;Khun Phaen&quot;, a Siamese general with super-human magical power who served the King of Ayutthaya, and his love-triangle relationship between himself, Khun Chang, and a beautiful Siamese girl named Wan-Thong. The composition of KCKP, much like other orally-transmitted epics, evolved over time. It originated as a recreational recitation or &quot;sepha&quot; within the Thai oral tradition from around the beginning of the 17th century (c.1600). Siamese troubadours and minstrels added more subplots and embellished scenes to the original storyline as time went on. By the late period of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it had attained the current shape as a long work of epic poem with the length of about 20,000 lines, spanning 43 &quot;samut thai&quot; books. The version that exists today was composed with &quot;klon&quot; meter throughout and is referred to in Thailand as &quot;nithan Kham Klon&quot; () meaning a &quot;poetic tale&quot;. A standard edition of KCKP, as published by the National Library, is 1085-page long.
As the national epic of the Siamese people, &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; is unique among other major epic poems of the world in that it concerns the struggles, romance, and martial exploits of non-aristocratic protagonists - with a high degree of realism - rather than being chiefly about the affairs of great kings, noble men or deities. The realism of KCKP also makes it standout from other epic literatures of the region. As Baker and Phongpaichit note, the depiction of war between Ayutthaya and Chiangmai in &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot; is &quot;[p]ossibly ... the most realistic depiction of pre-modern warfare in the region, portraying the adventure, the risk, the horror, and the gain.&quot; KCKP additionally contains rich and detailed accounts of the traditional Thai society during the late Ayutthaya period, including religious practices, superstitious beliefs, social relations, household management, military tactics, court and legal procedures etc. To this day, KCKP is regarded as the masterpiece of Thai literature for its high entertainment value - with engaging plots even by modern standard - and its wealth of cultural knowledge. Marveling at the sumptuous milieu of old Siamese customs, beliefs, and practices in which the story takes place, William J. Gedney, a philologist specialized in Southeast Asian languages, commented that: “The quality of much of this work is superb, often entrancing for its elegance, grace, and vitality. One cannot help feeling that this body of traditional Thai poetry is among the finest artistic creations in the history of mankind.” A complete English prose translation of KCKP was published by Chris Baker and P. Phongpaichit in 2010.

===The folk legend of Sri Thanonchai===
Another popular character among Ayutthaya folktales is the trickster, the best known is Sri Thanonchai (), usually a heroic figure who teaches or learns moral lessons and is known for his charm, wit, and verbal dexterity. Sri Thanonchai is a classic trickster-hero. Like Shakespeare&#x27;s villains, such as Iago, Sri Thanonchai&#x27;s motive is unclear. He simply uses his trickeries, jests and pranks to upend lives and affairs of others which sometimes results in tragic outcomes. The story of Sri Thanonchai is well known among both Thai and Lao people. In the Lao tradition, Sri Thanonchai is called &quot;Xiang Mieng&quot;. A Lao-Isaan version of &quot;Xiang Mieng&quot; describes Sri Thanonchai as an Ayutthayan trickster.

===The Legend of Phra Malai (1737)===

The Legend of Phra Malai () is a religious epic adventure composed by Prince Thammathibet, one of the greatest Ayutthayan poets, in 1737, although the story&#x27;s origin is assumed to be much older, being based on a Pali text. Phra Malai figures prominently in Thai art, religious treatises, and rituals associated with the afterlife, and the story is one of the most popular subjects of 19th-century illustrated Thai manuscripts.

Prince Thammathibet&#x27;s &quot;Phra Malai&quot; is composed in a style that alternates between &quot;rai&quot; and &quot;khlong sii-suphap.&quot; It tells a story of Phra Malai, a Buddhist monk of the Theravada tradition said to have attained supernatural powers through his accumulated merit and meditation. Phra Malai makes a journey into the realm of hell (naraka) to teach Buddhism to the underworld creatures and the deceased. Phra Malai then returns to the world of the living and tells people the story of the underworld, reminding listeners to make good merits and to adhere to the buddhist&#x27;s teachings in order to avoid damnation. While in the human realm, Phra Malai receives an offering of eight lotus flowers from a poor woodcutter, which he eventually offers at the Chulamani Chedi, a heavenly stupa believed to contain a relic of the Buddha. In Tavatimsa heaven, Phra Malai converses with the god Indra and the Buddha-to-come, Metteyya, who reveals to the monk insights about the future of mankind. Through recitations of Phra Malai the karmic effects of human actions were taught to the faithful at funerals and other merit-making occasions. Following Buddhist precepts, obtaining merit, and attending performances of the Vessantara Jataka all counted as virtues that increased the chances of a favourable rebirth, or Nirvana in the end.

===Other notable works from the Ayutthaya period===
Three most famous poets of the Ayutthaya period were Sīprāt (1653-1688) (), Phra Maha Raja-Kru (), and Prince Thammathibet (1715-1755) (). Sriprat composed &quot;Anirut Kham Chan&quot; (&quot;the tale of Prince Anirudha in &quot;kham chan&quot; poetry&quot;) which is considered to be one of the best &quot;kham chan&quot; composition in the Thai language. Prince Thammathibet composed many extant refined poems, including romantic &quot;parting and longing&quot; poems. He also composed Royal Barge Procession songs or &quot;kap hé reu&quot; () to be used during the King&#x27;s grand seasonal water-way procession which is a unique tradition of the Siamese. His barge-procession songs are still considered best in the Thai repertoire of royal procession poems. Other notable literary works of the mid and late Ayutthaya Kingdom include:
* &quot;Sue-ko Kham Chan&quot; () (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru (). Sue-ko Kham Chan is the earliest-known surviving &quot;kham chan&quot; () poem to appear in the Thai language. It is based on a story from Paññāsa Jātaka () or Apocryphal Birth-Stories of the Buddha. &quot;Sue-ko Kham Chan&quot; narrates a story concerning a virtuous brotherly-like friendship between a calf and a tiger cub. Their love for each other impresses a rishi who asks the gods to turn them into humans on the merits of their virtues. &quot;Sue-ko Kham Chan&quot; teaches an important concept of Buddhist teaching according to which one becomes a human being, the highest species of the animal, not because he was born such, but because of his virtue or &quot;sila-dhamma&quot; ().
* &quot;Samutta-Kōt Kham Chan&quot; () (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru. &quot;Samutta-Kōt kham chan&quot; is a religious-themed epic poem based on a story of Pannasa-Jataka. The poem is 2,218-stanza long (around 8,800 lines). However, the original poet, Phra Maha Raja-Kru, only composed 1,252 stanzas and did not finish it. King Narai (1633-1688) further composed 205 stanza during his reign and Paramanuchit-Chinorot, a noble-born poet monk and the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, finished it in 1849. Samut-Koat Kham Chan was praised by the Literature Society as one of the best &quot;kham chan&quot; poems in the Thai language.
* &quot;Jindamanee&quot; (; &quot;Gems of the Mind&quot;): the first Thai grammar book and considered to be the most important book for teaching Thai language until the early 20th century. The first part was probably written during the reign of King Ekathotsarot () (1605-1620). The later part was composed by Phra Horathibodi, a royal scholar, in the reign of King Narai (1633-1688). &quot;Jindamanee&quot; instructs not only the grammar and the orthography of Thai language, but also the art of poetry. &quot;Jindamanee&quot; contains many valuable samples of Thai poems from works which are now lost. For a 400-year-old Asian grammar book, &quot;Jindamanee&quot;″s didactic model is based on sound linguistic principles. Scholars believe that European knowledge on grammar, especially via French missionaries stationed in Siam during the 17th century, may have influenced its composition.

* &quot;Nang Sib Song&quot; (; &quot;the twelve princesses&quot;) or &quot;Phra Rotthasen&quot; () or &quot;Phra Rot Meri&quot; (): an indigenous folk tale, based on a previous life of the Buddha, popularized in many Southeast Asian countries. There are several poetic retellings of this story in the Thai language. The story of &quot;Nang Sib Song&quot; concerns the life of twelve sisters abandoned by their parents and adopted by an Ogress &quot;Santhumala&quot; disguised as a beautiful lady. The conclusion is the sad love story about the only surviving son of the twelve sisters, &quot;Phra Rotthasen&quot; (พระรถเสน) with &quot;Meri&quot; (เมรี) the adopted daughter of ogress Santhumala. This is a story of unrequited love that ends with the death of the lovers, Rotthsen and Meri.
* &quot;Lakhon&quot; (): &quot;Lakhon&quot; is a highly regarded type dramatic performance and literature in Siam. It is divided into two categories: &quot;lakhon nai&quot; (), dramatic plays reserved only for the aristocrats, and &quot;lakhon nōk&quot; (), plays for the enjoyment of the commoners. Only three plays have traditionally been classified as &quot;lakhon nai&quot;: &quot;Ramakien&quot;, &quot;Anirut&quot;, and &quot;Inao&quot;. Fifteen plays survived the destruction of Ayutthaya. Among the most well-known are:
** &quot;Sāng-thong&quot; () - a play based on a Buddhist &quot;jataka&quot; story of a noble man who hides his identity by disguising as a black-skinned savage. Its popularity was revived during the early Rattanakosin era by King Rama II who rewrote many parts of it as &quot;lakorn nok&quot;.
** &quot;Inao&quot; () - one of the three major &quot;lakhon nais&quot;. Inao was a very popular drama among the Siamese aristocrats of the late-Ayutthaya period. It is based on the East-Javanese Panji tales. Inao continued to be popular in the early-Rattanakosin era during which there are many adaptations of Inao in Thai language. The sack of Ayutthaya spread its popularity to Burma.
** &quot;Phikul Thong&quot; () or &quot;Phóm Hóm&quot; ():

==Early Rattanakosin period==
With the arrival of the Rattanakosin era, Thai literature experienced a rebirth of creative energy and reached its most prolific period. The Rattanakosin era is characterized by the imminent pressure to return to the literary perfection and to recover important literary works lost during the war between Ayutthaya and the Konbuang Empire. A considerable poetic and creative energy of this period was spent to revive or repair the national treasures which had been lost or damaged following the fall of the old Capital. Epics, notably &quot;Ramakien&quot; and &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot;, were recomposed or collected - with aid of surviving poets and troubadours who had committed them to memory (not rare in the 18th century) - and written down for preservation. Nevertheless, many court singers and poets were carried away or killed by the invading Burmese army and some works were lost forever. But it goes to show how rich the Siamese literary creations, especially poetical works, must have been before the war, since so much still survived even after the destruction of their former Kingdom.
The royal poets of the early Rattanakosin did not merely recompose the damaged or lost works of the Ayutthaya era but they also improved upon them. The Ramakien epic, recomposed and selected from various extant versions, during this period is widely considered to be more carefully worded than the old version lost to the fire. In addition, whereas the poet of Ayutthaya period did not care to adhere to strict metrical regulation of the indianised prosody, the compositions of Rattanakosin poets are so much more faithful to the metrical requirements. As a result, the poetry became generally more refined but also was rather difficult for the common man to appreciate. The literary circle of the early Rattanakosin era still only accepted poets who had a thorough classical education, with deep learning in classical languages. It was in this period that a new poetical hero, Sunthorn Phu () (1786-1855) emerged to defy the traditional taste of the aristocrat. Sunthorn Phu consciously moved away from a difficult and stately language of court poetry and composed mostly in a popular poetical form called &quot;klon suphap&quot; (). He mastered and perfected the art of &quot;klon suphap&quot; and his verses in this genre are considered peerless in the Thai language to the present day. There were also other masterpieces of &quot;Klon-suphap&quot; poem from this era, such as &quot;Kaki Klon Suphap&quot; – which influences the Cambodian &quot;Kakey&quot; – by Chao Phraya Phrakhlang (Hon).

The literary recovery project also resulted in the improvement of prose composition - an area which had been neglected in the previous Kingdom. A translation committee was set up in 1785, during the reign of King Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I), to translate important foreign works for the learning of the Thai people. This includes the Mon Chronicle &quot;Rachathirat&quot; as well as Chinese classics, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Sam-kok (), Investiture of the Gods or &quot;Fengshen&quot; (), Water Margin or &quot;Sòngjiāng&quot; (). These long prose works became a gold standard of Thai classical prose composition.

===King Rama II: poet king of Thailand===
King Phra Phutthaloetla Naphalai, also known as King Rama II of Siam (r. 1809-1824), was a gifted poet and playwright and is also a great patron of artists. His reign was known as the &quot;golden age of Rattanakosin literature&quot;. His literary salon was responsible for reviving and repairing many important works of literature which were damaged or lost during the sack of Ayutthaya. Poets, including &quot;Sunthorn Phu&quot;, thrived under his patronage. King Loetlanaphalai was himself a poet and artist. He is generally ranked second only to Sunthorn Phu in terms of poetic brilliance. As a young prince, he took part in recomposing the missing or damaged parts of Thai literary masterpieces, including &quot;Ramakien&quot; and &quot;Khun Chang Khun Phaen&quot;. He later wrote and popularized many plays, based on folk stories or old plays that survived the destruction of the old capital, including:
* &quot;Inao&quot; ()
* &quot;Krai Thong&quot; (): a Thai folktale, originating from Phichit Province. It tells the story of Chalawan (ชาลวัน), a crocodile lord who abducts a daughter of a wealthy Phichit man, and Kraithong, a merchant from Nonthaburi who seeks to rescue the girl and must challenge Chalawan. The story was adapted into a &quot;lakhon nok&quot; play, by King Rama II ,
* &quot;Kawee&quot; ()
* &quot;Sang Thong&quot; ()
* &quot;Sang Sín Chai&quot; ()
* &quot;Chaiya Chet&quot; (): a Thai folk story originating in the Ayutthaya period. Its popularity led to the dramatization of the story into &quot;lakhon&quot;. King Rama II rewrote the play for &quot;lakhon nok&quot; (ละครนอก), i.e., non-aristocratic theatre performances.

===Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;: the Siamese &quot;Odyssey&quot;===
The most important Thai poet in this period was Sunthorn Phu (สุนทรภู่) (1786-1855), widely known as &quot;the bard of Rattanakosin&quot; (). Sunthorn Phu is best known for his epic poem &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; (), which he started in 1822 (while in jail) and finished in 1844. &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; is a versified fantasy-adventure novel, a genre of Siamese literature known as &quot;nithan kham klon&quot; (). It relates the adventures of the eponymous protagonist, Prince Aphai Mani, who is trained in the art of music such that the songs of his flute could tame and disarm men, beasts, and gods. At the beginning of the story, Phra Aphai and his brother are banished from their kingdom because the young prince chooses to study music rather than to be a warrior. While in exile, Phra Aphai is kidnapped by a female Titan (or an ogress) named &quot;Pii Sue Samut&quot; (&#x27;sea butterfly&#x27;; ) who falls in love with him after she hears his flute music. Longing to return home, Phra Aphai manages to escape the ogress with the help of a beautiful mermaid. He fathers two sons, one with the ogress and another with the mermaid, who later grow up to be heroes with superhuman powers. Phra Aphai slays Pii Sue Samut (the ogress) with the song of his flute and continues his voyage; he suffers more shipwrecks, is rescued, and then falls in love with a princess named Suwanmali. A duel breaks out between Phra Aphai and Prince Ussaren, Suwanmali&#x27;s fiancé, with the maiden&#x27;s hand as the prize. Phra Aphai slays his rival. &quot;Nang Laweng&quot;, Ussaren&#x27;s sister and queen of Lanka (Ceylon), vows revenge. She bewitches rulers of other nations with her peerless beauty and persuades them to raise a great coalition army to avenge her fallen brother. Phra Aphai, too, is bewitched by Nang Laweng&#x27;s beauty. Nevertheless, he confronts Nang Laweng and they fall in love. The war and various troubles continue, but Phra Aphai and his sons prevail in the end. He appoints his sons as rulers of the cities he has won. Now tired of love and war, Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and retires to the forest with two of his wives to become ascetics.

====Composition and versions====
The epic tale of &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; is a massive work of poetry in &quot;klon suphap&quot; (). The unabridged version published by the National Library is 48,686-&quot;bāt&quot; (two line couplets) long, totaling over 600,000 words, and spanning 132 &quot;samut Thai&quot; books—by far the single longest poem in the Thai language, and is the world&#x27;s second longest epic poem written by a single poet. Sunthorn Phu, however, originally intended to end the story at the point where Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and withdraws. This leaves his original vision of the work at 25,098 bāt (two line couplet) of poetry, 64 &quot;samut thai&quot; books. But Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s literary patron wanted him to continue composing, which he did for many years. Today, the abridged version, i.e., his original 64 samut-thai volumes, or 25,098 couplets of poetry—is regarded as the authoritative text of the epic. It took Sunthorn Phu more than 20 years to compose (from c. 1822 or 1823 to 1844).

&quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; is Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s chef-d&#x27;œuvre. It breaks the literary tradition of earlier Thai poetic novels or &quot;nithan kham-klon&quot; () by including Western mythical creatures, such as mermaids, and contemporary inventions, such as steam-powered ships () which only started to appear in Europe in the early-1800s. Sunthorn Phu also writes about a mechanical music player at the time when a gramophone or a self-playing piano was yet to be invented. This made &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; surprisingly futuristic for the time. Also, unlike other classical Thai epic poems, &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; depicts various exploits of white mercenaries and pirates which reflects the ongoing European colonization of Southeast Asia in the early-19th century. Phra Aphai himself is said to have learned &quot;to speak &quot;farang&quot; (European), Chinese, and Cham languages.&quot; Moreover, the locations of cities and islands in &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; are not imagined but actually correspond to real geographical locations in the Andaman Sea as well as east of the Indian Ocean. Sunthorn Phu could also give an accurate description of modern sea voyage in that part of the world. This suggests that the Sunthorn Phu must have acquired this knowledge from foreign seafarers first-hand. The multi-cultural and the half-mythical, half-realistic setting of &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; combined with Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s poetic power, makes &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; a masterpiece.

====Sunthorn Phu as the poet of two worlds====
European colonial powers had been expanding their influence and presence into Southeast Asia when Sunthorn Phu was composing &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;. Many Thai literary critics have thus suggested that Sunthorn Phu may have intended his epic masterpiece to be an anti-colonialist tale, disguised as a versified tale of fantasy adventures. In a literary sense, however, &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; has been suggested by other Thai academics as being inspired by Greek epics and Persian literature, notably the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Argonauts, and Thousand and One Nights.

The structure of &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot; conforms to the monomyth structure, shared by other great epic stories in the Greek and Persian tradition. It is possible that Sunthorn Phu may have learned these epic stories from European missionaries, Catholic priests, or learned individuals who travelled to Siam during the early-19th century. Phra Aphai, the protagonist, resembles Orpheus—the famed musician of the Argonauts—rather than an Achilles-like warrior. Moreover, Phra Aphai&#x27;s odyssean journey conjures similarity with the King of Ithaca&#x27;s famous journey across the Aegean.

&quot;Pii Sue Samut&quot; (&quot;the sea butterfly&quot;), a love-struck female titan who kidnaps the hero, is reminiscent of the nymph Calypso. Also, much like Odysseus, Phra Aphai&#x27;s long voyage enables him to speak many languages and to discern the minds and customs of many foreign races. Phra Aphai&#x27;s name (: &#x27;to forgive&#x27;) is pronounced quite similar to how &quot;Orpheus&quot; () is pronounced in Greek. In addition, Nang Laweng&#x27;s bewitching beauty, so captivating it drives nations to war, seems to match the reputation of Helen of Troy. Others have suggested that &quot;Nang Laweng&quot; may have been inspired by a story of a Christian princess, as recounted in Persia&#x27;s &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot;, who falls in love with a Muslim king.

All of this suggests that Sunthorn Phu was a Siamese bard with a bright and curious mind who absorbed, not only the knowledge of contemporary seafaring and Western inventions, but also stories of Greek classical epics from learned Europeans. In composing &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;, Sunthorn Phu demonstrates a grand poetic ambition. He became the first Thai writer to draw inspirations from Western literary sources and produces an epic based, loosely, upon an amalgamation of those myths and legends. Thus, rather than writing with a political motive, Sunthorn Phu might simply have wanted to equal his literary prowess to the most famed poets and writers of the West.

====Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s other literary legacy====
Sunthorn Phu is also the master of the Siamese tradition of parting-and-longing poetry or &quot;nirat&quot; which was popular among Thai poets who journeyed away from loved ones. Sunthorn Phu composed many nirat poems, probably from 1807 when he was on a trip to Mueang Klaeng (เมืองแกลง), a town between Rayong (his hometown) and Chanthaburi. There are many forms of &quot;travel&quot; or parting-and-longing poetry in the Thai language. In the Ayutthaya period, these were composed by noblemen (such as Prince Thammathibet (1715-1756)), whose sentimentality and expressions were refined and formal. Sunthorn Phu was different because he was a common man and his poetry is more fun (สนุก), catchy, and humorous. Sunthorn Phu was probably not as classically trained as other Thai famous poets (who were often members of the royal family) in the past. Nidhi Eoseewong, a Thai historian, argues that Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s success can be attributable to the rise of the bourgeoisie or the middle class audience—following the transformation of Siam from a feudal society to a market economy—who held different values and had different tastes from aristocrats.

Sunthorn Phu was therefore, like Shakespeare, a people&#x27;s poet. Instead of exclusively writing to please aristocratic institutions or patrons, Sunthorn Phu also writes both to entertain and to instruct, which shows his confidence in his personal mission as a poet. His works were thus popular among common Siamese, and he was prolific enough to make a living from it. Sunthorn Phu exercised his &quot;copyright&quot; by allowing people to make copies of his &quot;nithan&quot; poems (), such as &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;, for a fee. This made Sunthorn Phu one of the first Thais to ever earn a living as an author. Although a bard of the royal court, he was disdained by many genteel and noble-born poets for appealing to the common people.

Sunthorn Phu was a prolific poet. Many of Sunthorn Phu&#x27;s works were lost or destroyed due to his sojourn lifestyle. However, much is still extant. He is known to have composed:
* Nine &quot;nirat&quot; (travel) poems,
* Four &quot;nithan kham klon&quot; or poetic stories (), discounting &quot;Phra Aphai Mani&quot;, namely:
** Kōbut ()
** Phra Chai Suriya ()
** Laksanawong ()
** Singha-kraiphop ()
* Three didactic moral-teaching poems,
* Four &quot;bōt hé klŏm&quot; () or lullabies
* One &quot;lakhon&quot; () or a dramatic play, namely &quot;Aphainurāt&quot; ()

==Modern Thai literature==
Kings Rama V and Rama VI were also writers, mainly of non-fiction works as part of their programme to combine Western knowledge with traditional Thai culture. The story Lilit Phra Lo (ลิลิตพระลอ) was voted the best &quot;lilit&quot; work by King Rama VI&#x27;s royal literary club in 1916. Based on the tragic end of King Phra Lo, who died together with the two women he loved, Phra Phuean and Phra Phaeng, the daughters of the ruler of the city of Song, it originated in a tale of Thai folklore and later became part of Thai literature.

Twentieth century Thai writers tended to produce light fiction rather than literature. But increasingly, individual writers are being recognized for producing more serious works, including writers like Kukrit Pramoj, Kulap Saipradit, (penname Siburapha), Supa Sirisingh (penname &quot;Botan&quot;), Chart Korbjitti, Prabda Yoon, Duanwad Pimwana, Rong Wongsawan and Pitchaya Sudbanthad. Some of their works have been translated into English. The Isan region of Thailand has produced two literary social critics in Khamsing Srinawk and Pira Sudham. Notably, Pira Sudham writes in English.

Thailand had a number of expatriate writers in the 20th century as well. The Bangkok Writers Group publishes fiction by Indian author G. Y. Gopinath, the fabulist A. D. Thompson, as well as non-fiction by Gary Dale Cearley.

==Thai literary influence on neighbouring countries==
Thai literature, especially its poetic tradition, has had a strong influence on neighbouring countries, especially Burma and Cambodia. The two golden periods of Burmese literature were the direct consequences of the Thai literary influence. The first occurred during the two-decade period (1564–1583) when the Toungoo Dynasty made Siam a vassal state. The conquest incorporated many Thai elements into Burmese literature. Most evident were the &quot;yadu&quot; or &quot;yatu&quot; (), an emotional and philosophic verse, and the &quot;yagan&quot; () genre. The next transmission of Thai literary influence to Burma happened in the aftermath of the fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. After a second conquest of Ayutthaya (Thailand), many Siamese royal dancers and poets were brought back to the court of Konbaung. Ramakien, the Thai version of &quot;Ramayana&quot; () was introduced and was adapted in Burmese where it is now called Yama Zatdaw. Many dramatic songs and poems were transliterated directly from the Thai language. In addition, the Burmese also adopted the Thai tradition of &quot;Nirat&quot; poetry, which became popular among the Burmese royal class. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modeled after the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court.

Cambodia had fallen under Siamese hegemony in the reign of King Naresuan. But it was during the Thonburi Kingdom that the high cultures of the Rattanakosin kingdom were systematically transmitted to a Cambodian court that absorbed them voraciously. As Fédéric Maurel, a French historian, notes:

It was during this period of Siamzation that Thai literary influence had a wholesale impact on Khmer literature. The &quot;Nirat&quot; or Siamese tradition of parting poetry was emulated by Khmer poets; and many Thai stories were translated directly from the Siamese source into Khmer language.

One Thai study on comparative literature found that Cambodia&#x27;s current version of Ramayana (Reamker) was translated directly from the Thai source, stanza by stanza. The Cambodian royal court used to stage Thai &quot;lakhon&quot; dramas in Thai language during King Narodom&#x27;s reign. While older Reamker literary texts may have existed before the 16th century but most of the work has now been lost.

<text>Sir Thomas Moulson (sometimes spelled &quot;Mowlson&quot;) (c. 1568–1638), an alderman and member of the Grocers&#x27; Company, was a Sheriff of London in 1624 and Lord Mayor of London in 1634. He represented the City of London as a Member of Parliament in 1628.

Sir Thomas was a native of Hargrave, Cheshire, and in 1627 built a combined chapel and school in the village which is now St Peter&#x27;s Church, Hargrave. He also set up a trust to maintain the chapel and school.

His wife, Lady Anne Moulson (&quot;née&quot; Radcliffe; 1576–1661), was commemorated in 1894 by the name of Radcliffe College. One of their grandsons, John Kendrick, became Lord Mayor of London (1651).

<text>The Osage River is a tributary of the Missouri River in central Missouri in the United States. The eighth-largest river in the state, it drains a mostly rural area of . The watershed includes an area of east-central Kansas and a large portion of west-central and central Missouri, where it drains northwest areas of the Ozark Plateau.

The river flows generally easterly, then northeasterly for the final where it joins the Missouri River. It is impounded in two major locations. Most of the river has been converted into a chain of two reservoirs, the Harry S. Truman Reservoir and the Lake of the Ozarks.

==Description==
The Osage is formed in southwestern Missouri, approximately northeast of Nevada on the Bates-Vernon County line, by the confluence of the Marais des Cygnes and Little Osage Rivers; the Marais des Cygnes is sometimes counted as part of the river, placing its headwaters in eastern Kansas and bringing its total length to over . The combined stream flows east past the Schell-Osage Wildlife Area into St. Clair County, widening into a long meandering arm of the Harry S. Truman Reservoir, approximately long. The lake receives the South Grand River as a second arm of the reservoir from the northwest, as well as the Pomme de Terre River from the south. The two arms of the reservoir join near the Harry S. Truman Dam in central Benton County.

Downstream from the Truman Dam, the river becomes the serpentine Lake of the Ozarks, stretching eastward for nearly to Bagnell Dam in Camden County and southwestern Miller County. Constructed in 1931, the dam collects the Niangua River. Downstream from the dam, the Osage flows freely to the northeast in broad oxbow meanders through forested bluffs, joining the Missouri approximately east and downstream of Jefferson City.

==History==

The river is named for the Osage Nation, the historic indigenous people who dominated this region at the time when the first European settlers arrived. The river presented significant navigation difficulties for early settlers because of its fluctuating water levels, as well as the presence of shallow pools and sand bars caused by its tight meandering course through the hills.

The Missouri Legislature attempted as early as 1839 to deepen the channel of the river. Early attempts failed because of lack of funding for the immense task. Commercial navigation on the river in the 19th century was confined mostly to smaller craft that could navigate the tight bends and shoals of the river. Improvements in the channel by the last two decades of the century led to greater commercial traffic. These changes made the lower reaches of the river navigable for steamboat commerce for a period of six to nine months out of the year.

=== Transportation ===
Prior to the construction of the Bagnell Dam, the main method of crossing the river was the Bagnell Ferry, which began operation in 1882, speared by Samuel Umpsted as the contractor. Several ferry accidents, including sinking, resulted in the deaths of several customers. The ferry declined in operation towards 1940, years after the dam had finished.

=== Hydroelectricity ===
In the 20th century, private construction of the Bagnell Dam, primarily to generate hydroelectricity, began in 1922 and was completed after nine years. It effectively ended commercial navigation on the river. The federally constructed Truman Dam was authorized by the federal Flood Control Act of 1954 and was completed in 1979.

The two dams on the river generate power for the St. Louis metropolitan area. The large reservoirs have become popular tourist destinations and recreation areas in the region.

<doc id="690461" wikidata="Q1452597" url="?curid=690461" title="Freddie Hart">
<text>Frederick Segrest (December 21, 1926 – October 27, 2018), known professionally as Freddie Hart, was an American country musician and songwriter best known for his chart-topping country song and lone pop hit &quot;Easy Loving,&quot; which won the Country Music Association Song of the Year award in 1971 and 1972.

Hart charted singles from 1953 to 1987, and later became a gospel singer. He also performed at music festivals and other venues until his death in 2018.

==Biography==
===Childhood and military service===
Hart was born to a sharecropper family in Loachapoka, Alabama, United States, and spent his childhood in nearby Phenix City, Alabama, along with his 11 siblings (Nadine, Bo, Junior, Olin, Marrell, Pearl, Lonnie, Sandra, Gail, J.P., Harold, and a child who died in infancy). He learned to play guitar at age 5 and quit school by age 12.

At age 15, Hart lied about his age to join the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II, seeing combat action on Guam and Iwo Jima. After the war, he lived in California, where he taught classes in self-defense at the Los Angeles Police Academy.

===Early career===
Hart got an early career break when singer Carl Smith covered Hart&#x27;s song &quot;Loose Talk&quot; in 1955. Other artists who recorded his songs included Patsy Cline (&quot;Lovin&#x27; In Vain&quot;), George Jones (&quot;My Tears are Overdue&quot;) and Porter Wagoner (&quot;Skid Row Joe&quot;).

During the early 1950s, Hart and his family moved to California to further the growing country music scene there. In 1951, he joined Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s band for a year. It was through Frizzell that Hart got his first recording contract with Capitol Records in 1953. He released several singles including his version of &quot;Loose Talk&quot;, but none of these were successful. In 1958, Hart signed with Columbia Records and scored his first chart hit with &quot;The Wall&quot; in 1959 which made the Top 20. His biggest hit for the label was the 1960 Top 20 hit &quot;The Key&#x27;s In The Mailbox&quot;.

In 1965, Hart signed with Kapp Records where he would score several Top 40 hits between 1965 and 1968. The biggest of these hits included &quot;Hank Williams&#x27; Guitar&quot; (1965), &quot;Born A Fool&quot; (1968) and &quot;Togetherness&quot; (1968).

===Re-signing with Capitol Records and Easy Loving===
In 1969, Hart re-signed with Capitol Records and soon became a part of the Bakersfield sound by signing up with Buck Owens&#x27; songwriting and management company. In early 1970, he scored a Top 30 hit with &quot;The Whole World&#x27;s Holdin&#x27; Hands&quot;. Hart&#x27;s song &quot;Togetherness&quot;, a hit for him in 1968, became a Top 15 hit for Buck Owens and Susan Raye that summer. Hart would score several minor hits during the year.

In 1971, Hart released a song that he wrote called &quot;Easy Loving&quot; which was first recorded in the summer of 1969 for his album &quot;California Grapevine&quot;, released in 1970. Released in the summer of 1971, &quot;Easy Loving&quot; rapidly began climbing the charts; and by that September, it was No. 1 for three weeks on the country chart and reached No. 17 on the pop chart. It was also played on adult contemporary stations, earning a position on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Easy Listening survey. The song would ultimately win Hart numerous awards from both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association. The song sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold record by the R.I.A.A. in November 1971. The album of the same name also reportedly went gold. The song also earned Hart a Grammy Award nomination.

From this success, Hart and his backup band, the Heartbeats, had a string of Top 5 hits with &quot;My Hang-Up Is You&quot; (six weeks at No. 1 in 1972), &quot;Bless Your Heart&quot; (No. 1 in 1972), &quot;Got the All Overs For You (All Over Me)&quot; (No. 1 in 1972), &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Feel It (It Ain&#x27;t There)&quot; (1973), &quot;Super Kind of Woman&quot; (No. 1 in 1973), &quot;Trip to Heaven&quot; (No. 1 in 1973), &quot;Hang In There Girl&quot; (1974), &quot;The Want-To&#x27;s&quot; (1974), &quot;My Woman&#x27;s Man&quot; (1975), &quot;The First Time&quot; (1975), &quot;I&#x27;d Like To Sleep Till I Get Over You&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Warm Side of You&quot; (1975). He has been called by many fans as &quot;The Heart and Soul of Country Music&quot;.

With the success of &quot;Easy Loving&quot; and other songs he wrote, plus a popular concert attraction on the road, Hart became independently wealthy and owned a songwriting company, a school for the blind, a trucking company, and a chain of martial arts studios—his hobby was as a master of karate.

===Late 1970s–1980s===
By 1976, Hart continued to have major hits, although now his streak of Top 10s was replaced by a streak of Top 20 and Top 30 hits. These included &quot;You Are The Song Inside Of Me&quot; (1976), &quot;That Look In Her Eyes&quot; (1976), &quot;Thank God She&#x27;s Mine&quot; (1977), &quot;The Pleasure&#x27;s Been All Mine&quot; (1977), &quot;Toe to Toe&quot; (1978), and &quot;Wasn&#x27;t It Easy Baby&quot; (1979). His last Top 10 hit came with the hit &quot;Why Lovers Turn to Strangers&quot; in 1977, which peaked at No. 8. This song was written by east Idaho based composer Bobby Fender.

In 1980, Hart signed with Sunbird Records, and immediately scored a Top 20 hit with &quot;Sure Thing&quot; that year. He followed this up with three Top 40 hits in 1981. This ended his days as a major country artist. In 1985 and 1987, he had a couple of minor hits on El Dorado and 5th Avenue Records, with his last hit being &quot;The Best Love I Never Had&quot; in 1987 peaking at No. 77.

===Later years and death===
In 2001, Hart was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. A few years later, Phenix City declared a major east–west street Freddie Hart Parkway in his honor.

Hart released a handful of new albums on CD, showcasing his passion for gospel music, patriotism and the traditional country sound that originally made him famous. These albums prompted him to selectively tour and perform concerts around the world. Hart retained a large following in Europe and the U.S., performing at music festivals, universities, churches and industry events.

Hart continued to write and record gospel music during the 2000s. He received numerous awards and had several number one songs in the gospel field. In 2004 he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriter&#x27;s Hall Of Fame. In 2017 he performed in Pigeon Forge Tennessee and received the Hall of Fame award from the North American Country Music Associations International. His final performance was in March 2018 on the Ernest Tubb Midnite Jamboree as a special guest to David Frizzell. Hart sang a new song he had written and just recorded about Lefty Frizzell, titled simply &quot;Lefty&quot;. In April 2018, Hart recorded his final album, titled &quot;God Bless You&quot;. The project, produced by David Frizzell, contains 11 newly written gospel songs and a remake of his signature song &quot;Easy Loving&quot;. The album was released in late 2018.

Hart died as a result of pneumonia on October 27, 2018, in Burbank, California.

==The Heartbeats==
Freddie Hart first used the name Heartbeats, a play on his last name, as his backing on a one-off 1967 album credited to Freddie Hart and the Heartbeats, but after his hit &quot;Easy Loving&quot; in 1971, ten studio albums were released between 1972 and 1977 credited to Freddie Hart and the Heartbeats. Various musicians performed in the Heartbeats over the years, including Bobby Wayne and Dennis Hromek, both of whom would go on to join the Strangers. During their heyday in the mid-1970s, the Heartbeats even released one studio album credited to just themselves in 1975.
