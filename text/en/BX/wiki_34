<text>Aloysius Martin Thesz (April 24, 1916 – April 28, 2002), known by the ring name Lou Thesz, was an American professional wrestler and wrestling coach. Considered to be one of the last true shooters (legitimate wrestlers) in professional wrestling and described as the &quot;quintessential athlete&quot; and a &quot;polished warrior who could break a man in two if pushed the wrong way&quot;, Thesz is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers and wrestling world champions in history, and possibly the last globally accepted world champion.

Thesz won various version of the World Heavyweight Championship seven times, including three reigns as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, which he held for a combined total of ten years, three months and nine days (3,749 days) – longer than anyone else in history. In Japan, Thesz was known as the &quot;&quot;God of Wrestling&#x27;&quot; (like his Belgian counterpart, Karl Gotch) and was called &quot;Tetsujin&quot;&quot;, which means &quot;Ironman&quot;, in respect for his speed, conditioning and expertise in catch wrestling. Alongside Karl Gotch and Billy Robinson, Thesz later helped train young Japanese wrestlers and mixed martial artists in catch wrestling. In his final years, he was head coach at the .

A successful amateur wrestler in his youth and an ardent supporter of the sport in his later years, he helped establish, in addition to being a member of its inaugural class, the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, which honors successful professional wrestlers with a strong amateur wrestling background, and is a charter member of several other halls of fame, including: WCW, &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;, Professional Wrestling and WWE&#x27;s Legacy Wing.

== Early life ==
Aloysius Martin Thesz was born in Banat, Michigan on April 24, 1916. His father, Martin, was a working-class shoemaker of Hungarian and German descent; his mother, Katherine (née Schultz), also of German descent, hailed from the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family moved to St. Louis in Missouri when he was a young boy. Thesz and his three sisters grew up speaking German at home and he did not start learning English until he entered kindergarten at age five. Hungarian was also spoken in the Thesz household but the children did not learn it. In addition to public school, he also had to attend German school every Saturday until he was eight. He was fluent in German and English.

== Wrestling career ==

=== Amateur wrestling ===
Thesz&#x27;s father was a national Greco-Roman wrestling middleweight champion in his native Hungary and introduced Lou to the sport as a young boy. At eight years old, Lou began a tough and thorough education in Greco-Roman wrestling under his father, which provided the fundamentals for his later success. He trained in Greco-Roman wrestling under the guidance of his father for several years until transitioning to folkstyle wrestling in high school, where he was a successful competitor on his school team. He also trained in boxing as a teenager. Thesz dropped out of high school by age 14 to work at his father&#x27;s shoe repair business and began training in freestyle wrestling at Cleveland High School due to his father knowing the wrestling coaches. He quickly became an accomplished freestyle wrestler, competing in city-wide intramurals and regional tournaments in the 160 lb division. At aged 16, Thesz then gained further training in freestyle wrestling under John Zastro. Thesz credited Zastro for elevating his wrestling and became his regular sparring partner. Thesz won several amateur titles and became one of the most dominant freestyle wrestlers of his weight class in the county, and caught the eye of Tom Packs, a professional wrestling promoter in St. Louis. Packs met with Thesz and asked if he wanted to wrestle professionally and Thesz accepted. Thesz later said he would have continued his amateur career had he not been asked. Packs sent Lou to George Tragos for further coaching.

=== Training under the pros ===

George Tragos, a feared Greek Olympic freestyle wrestler, catch wrestler and wrestling coach at the University of Missouri, took a liking to Thesz and respected his willingness to work hard and follow instruction. He trained under the watchful eye of Tragos for nearly four years at the National Gym in St. Louis. Tragos, who had a well-deserved reputation as a dangerous catch wrestler, decried the emerging performance-related aspects of the sport and instead coached young men to be true, authentic professional wrestlers. Tragos specifically taught Thesz submission wrestling and how to wrestle from the bottom. Thesz remembered Tragos saying, &quot;any fool can start on top. If you start at the bottom, you learn to wrestle.&quot; Ray Steele also served as a coach and mentor to Thesz during this time.

Thesz also studied under German-born catch wrestler Ad Santel, who was known for his feud with the Kodokan judo school. Thesz studied under Santel for up to five days every week during a 6-month stay in California and remembered it being the &quot;most intensive training period of my life&quot;. Throughout his career, Thesz continued to train under Santel whenever he was in the California area. The training he received under Santel would help establish Thesz as one of the most dangerous grapplers in the world.

Thesz later met legendary former champion Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis in St. Louis and was encouraged to challenge Lewis to a friendly contest. Although Thesz lost the 15-minute contest, Lewis was impressed by Thesz&#x27;s skills and later became his manager and trainer. Lewis later described Thesz as &quot;lithe as a panther and exceptionally fast. He moves with the speed of a lightweight.&quot; As his trainer, Lewis taught Thesz extremely painful and potentially crippling submission holds that would help him when facing opponents that refused to lose.

=== Early professional career ===

Thesz made his professional wrestling debut at the age of 17, performing in undercard matches around the St. Louis territory whilst still working at his father&#x27;s shoe repair shop. However, Thesz spent most of his early career honing his craft under the tutelage of George Tragos in both catch and freestyle wrestling, and later with Ad Santel. When not taking a local booking, Tragos arranged Thesz with competitive workouts with top collegiate wrestlers in the region. Thesz then worked the Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and California territory, continuing to compete on the undercards while honing his craft on the road. Thesz notably worked out with top amateurs trained by Billy Thom, head coach of the 1936 U.S. Olympic wrestling team, and old carnival wrestlers around the region including Earl Wampler, who became his mentor and occasional workout partner on the road.

=== AWA and National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Champion ===
By 1937, Thesz had become one of the biggest stars in the St. Louis territory, and on December 29 he defeated Everett Marshall for the American Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship in a grueling three hour match, the first of many world heavyweight titles, which also made Thesz became the youngest world heavyweight champion in history, at the age of 21. There is speculation that this match may have been a legitimate shoot contest. Thesz later told wrestling historian Mike Chapman that he was there to wrestle competitively, which he did, and ended up winning the match, but was unsure if he actually won or Marshall dropped the title to him. He later dropped the title to Steve &quot;Crusher&quot; Casey in Boston six weeks later. He won the National Wrestling Association World Heavyweight Championship in 1939, once again defeating Marshall, and again in 1948, defeating Bill Longson.

=== National Wrestling Alliance ===
In 1948, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) was formed, the purpose being to create one world champion for all the various wrestling territories throughout North America. Orville Brown, the reigning Midwest World Heavyweight Championship holder, was named the first champion. Thesz, at the time, was head of a promotional combine that included fellow wrestling champions Longson, Bobby Managoff, Canadian promoter Frank Tunney and Eddie Quinn, who promoted in the St. Louis territory where NWA promoter Sam Muchnick was running opposition. Quinn and Muchnick ended their promotional war, and Thesz&#x27; promotion was absorbed into the NWA. Part of the deal was a title unification match between Brown and Thesz, who held the National Wrestling Association&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship. Unfortunately, just weeks before the scheduled bout, Brown was involved in an automobile accident that ended his career, and he was forced to vacate the championship and the NWA awarded the title to the No. 1 contender, Thesz. Thesz was chosen for his skill as a &quot;hooker&quot; to prevent double crosses by would-be shooters who would deviate from the planned finish for personal glory.

==== NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion and dominance ====
Between 1949 and 1956, Thesz set out to unify all the existing world titles into the National Wrestling Alliance Worlds Heavyweight Championship. In 1952, he defeated Baron Michele Leone in Los Angeles for the California World Heavyweight title and became the closest any wrestler had been to being undisputed world heavyweight wrestling champion since Danno O&#x27;Mahony in 1936. Thesz finally dropped the title to Whipper Billy Watson in 1956, and took several months off to recuperate from an ankle injury. He regained the title from Watson seven months later.

1957 was an important year for Thesz; on June 14, the first taint to Thesz&#x27; claim of undisputed champion occurred in a match with gymnast-turned-wrestling star, Edouard Carpentier. The match was tied at two falls apiece when Thesz claimed a legitimate back injury and forfeit the last fall, thus Carpentier was declared the winner; however, the NWA chose not to recognize the title change, deciding a championship could not change hands due to injury. Despite the NWA&#x27;s decision, there were some promotions who continued to recognize Carpentier&#x27;s claim to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. That same year, Thesz became the first wrestler to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Japan, wrestling Rikidōzan in a series of 60-minute draws. Their first match notably started as a legitimate contest as Rikidōzan believed himself to be a far superior wrestler. Thesz quickly dominated Rikidōzan and easily beat him to win the first fall. Rikidōzan accepted defeat and they worked the rest of the match. Their bouts popularized professional wrestling in Japan, gaining the sport mainstream acceptance. Realizing he could make more money in the land of the rising sun, Thesz petitioned to the NWA promoters to regularly defend the championship belt in Japan, but his request was turned down, and Thesz asked to drop the title to his own hand picked champion, Dick Hutton, rather than Thesz&#x27;s real-life rival and the more popular choice, Buddy Rogers. Thesz would embark on a tour of Europe and Japan, billing himself as the NWA International Heavyweight Champion; this title is still recognized as a part of All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship.

==== Final world championship run with NWA ====
In 1963, Thesz came out of semi-retirement to win his sixth world heavyweight championship from Buddy Rogers at the age of 46. In 1964, he infamously faced Kintarō Ōki, a student of Rikidōzan, in what turned into a legitimate shoot contest. Originally scheduled for three falls, Ōki shot on Thesz in the first round. Ōki&#x27;s move to shoot on Thesz ended things fast, as Thesz wounded him to the point that Ōki was stretchered off. He would hold the NWA title until 1966 when, at the age of 50, he lost it to Gene Kiniski. On May 29, 1968, in Bombay, Dara Singh&#x27;s victory over Lou Thesz earned Dara Singh the World Championship. According to Thesz, Singh (who was 12 years younger than Thesz) was &quot;an authentic wrestler, and was superbly conditioned.&quot; For these reasons, Thesz had no problem losing to Dara Singh.

=== Late career ===
Thesz wrestled on a part-time basis over the next 13 years, winning his last major title in 1978, in Mexico, becoming the inaugural Universal Wrestling Alliance Heavyweight Champion at the age of 62, before dropping the championship to El Canek a year later. Thesz wrestled a match with Luke Graham in 1979 billed as his retirement match and considered himself retired after this, though he did continue to wrestle exhibition matches periodically through the 1980s. On November 16, 1987, Thesz won a World Wrestling Federation &quot;legends&quot; battle royal featuring Killer Kowalski, Nick Bockwinkel, Gene Kiniski, Edouard Carpentier and other legends. He finally wrestled his last public match on December 26, 1990, in Hamamatsu, Japan at the age of 74, against his protégé, Masahiro Chono. This makes him one of the only male professional wrestlers, along with Abdullah The Butcher, to wrestle in seven different decades.

== Later life ==
After retiring, Thesz remained involved in the wrestling industry. He later became a special guest referee, promoter and trainer. He became the commissioner and occasional trainer for the shoot-style promotion Union of Professional Wrestling Forces International, and lent the promotion one of his old NWA championship belts, which they recognized as their own world title. With the promotion he spent one week every month in Japan teaching the wrestlers techniques in catch wrestling. However, by 1993 his enthusiasm for the UWFi waned as the company started moving away from its shootfighting style and favoring performers over wrestlers, and he soon severed relations with the company, taking his old championship belt back with him. His specific criticisms included the use of power bombs, deriding them as unrealistic despite his own use of them and their later use in MMA fights. As an announcer, Thesz was the color commentator for International World Class Championship Wrestling&#x27;s weekly television show.
He was highly critical of modern-day professional wrestling and described it as &#x27;choreographed tumbling&#x27;, showcasing little to no actual wrestling skills. He commented on the rise of mixed martial arts and favourably compared it to his early days as a competitive catch wrestler. Through his friendship with his student Gene LeBell, Thesz had an association with Gokor Chivichyan and LeBell&#x27;s Hayastan MMA Academy. He remained active as a wrestling coach, holding seminars in Virginia and later Florida. One of his most famous students, Kiyoshi Tamura, was one of the first men to beat a member of the Gracie family in over fifty years, beating Renzo Gracie by unanimous decision in an MMA fight. Kit Bauman, co-writer of Thesz&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Hooker&quot;, received a magazine mailed by Thesz that included a story on the sport of pankration, an Ancient Greek combat sport that blended wrestling and boxing (and considered an early precursor to MMA), with a brief note that Thesz wrote saying, &quot;this sounds like something I would have enjoyed.&quot; Thesz was frequently seen in attendance at NCAA wrestling events and was a lifelong supporter of amateur wrestling. He made occasional visits to top collegiate universities in the country, most notably striking up friendships with Old Dominion University head coach Gray Simons and University of Iowa head coach Dan Gable.

In 1992, Thesz became the president of the Cauliflower Alley Club (CAC), an organization recognizing and supporting retired wrestlers, boxers and actors who enjoyed an association with wrestling. He served as CAC&#x27;s president until 2000. In 1999, he helped establish the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, a hall of fame and museum located within the National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum&#x27;s Dan Gable Museum. The hall of fame honors professional wrestlers with a strong amateur wrestling background. Thesz became the first inductee alongside George Tragos, Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis and Frank Gotch. He served on the Board of Directors and also did part-time coaching on the wrestling mats at the museum.

== Personal life ==
Thesz was married three times. His first marriage to Evelyn Katherine Ernst on March 22, 1937. Thesz was convalescing from a severe knee injury suffered in 1939 and from 1941 to 1944 worked as a dog breeder and trainer for Dogs for Defense and later as a supervisor for the Todd Houston Shipyard. He divorced his first wife in 1944 and at the shipyard, Thesz met his second wife, Fredda Huddleston Winter, with whom he fathered three children: Jeff Thesz, Robert Thesz and Patrick Thesz. Thesz&#x27;s second marriage came to an end after he and Fredda divorced in 1975. He married Charlie Catherine Thesz and remained with her for the rest of his life. Thesz lived in Norfolk, Virginia for much of his later life and started a wrestling school called the Virginia Wrestling Academy in 1988. One of Thesz&#x27;s protégés Mark Fleming became head coach of the academy. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;Hooker: An Authentic Wrestler&#x27;s Adventures Inside the Bizarre World of Professional Wrestling&quot;. Thesz was drafted into the army in 1944, despite a legitimate injury to his knee and multiple medical deferments. Owing to his wrestling background, he taught hand-to-hand combat defense for medics before being discharged in 1946.

Thesz remained in good health through his older years, however after undergoing triple bypass surgery for an aortic valve replacement on April 9, 2002, he died due to complications weeks later on April 28, four days after his 86th birthday, in Orlando, Florida.

==Legacy==

Thesz is strongly considered by many to be the greatest professional wrestler of the 20th century. Among his many accomplishments in the sport, he is credited with inventing a number of professional wrestling moves and holds such as the belly-to-back waistlock suplex (later known as the &quot;German suplex&quot; due to its association with Karl Gotch), the Lou Thesz press, stepover toehold facelock (STF), and the original powerbomb.

Thesz was the first wrestler to ever hold the NWA International Heavyweight Championship, which became a part of what is now the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship under All Japan Pro Wrestling. Thesz was also the first UWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct Universal Wrestling Association in Mexico, where he won the title after defeating Mil Máscaras on July 26, 1976. Thesz was the first ever TWWA World Heavyweight Champion for the now defunct International Wrestling Enterprise as well. Thesz and &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (Dory Funk Sr.) were the first ever NWA Pacific Coast (Vancouver) Tag Team Champions.

In 1999, his name was given to the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame for professional wrestling stars with a successful amateur background at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Waterloo, Iowa, where he was an inaugural inductee. In October 1997, Thesz was honored by a ceremony at World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF) Badd Blood as being both the youngest and oldest world heavyweight champion at ages 21 and 50, respectively (technically, Verne Gagne holds the record for oldest champ, when he held the AWA World Heavyweight Championship in 1980 at age 54, which was tied by WWF owner Vince McMahon in 1999; Thesz has since been supplanted as the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion by former champion Tim Storm (who was born on February 18, 1964), who won the title at age 52 by defeating Jax Dane on October 21, 2016). In 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Thesz the most influential NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time. In 2002, Thesz was named the second greatest professional wrestler of all time behind Ric Flair in the magazine article &quot;100 Wrestlers of All Time&quot; by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek.

Former NCAA champion and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jack Brisco named Thesz his all-time favorite professional wrestler by saying that &quot;Lou Thesz was my idol. He was a great wrestler, a great example, a class man&quot;. AEW wrestler Claudio Castagnoli named Thesz his &quot;dream&quot; tag team partner and said, &quot;He [Thesz] personifies wrestling. He represents everything that I think it should be. He&#x27;s a class act, and he was a workhorse for the company, while at the same time being a student of the game. He was completely legit. I would have loved a chance to go one-on-one with him or to work alongside him&quot;. Japanese wrestler Rikidōzan, who had several matches with Thesz in Japan, considered Thesz to be the greatest wrestler of all time and lamented that &quot;after the match with the world&#x27;s greatest wrestler, fights with other run-of-the-mill wrestlers became unappetizing for me&quot;.

Three-time NCAA heavyweight champion and NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dick Hutton said that Thesz was the best man he ever met, in any type of wrestling (both competitive and performance). Hutton later said that Thesz was &quot;the only man I ever faced in the ring, professional or amateur, who was faster than I was.&quot; National judo champion, grappler and professional wrestler Gene LeBell said that he considered Thesz to be one of his &#x27;teachers&#x27;, saying &quot;Lou Thesz, Karl Gotch and Vic Christy all taught me a lot about grappling... From Thesz I learned how to hurt people. He had a little bit of a sadistic side&quot;. LeBell also mentioned that he learned most of his submission grappling from Thesz. LeBell also considers Thesz, Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis and Karl Gotch as the toughest men he has ever known. Wrestling promoter Sam Muchnick considered Ed &quot;Strangler&quot; Lewis as the greatest legitimate wrestler he had ever seen, with Thesz, Ray Steele, Joe Stecher, Jim Londos and John Pesek &quot;only a few steps behind Lewis.&quot; Fellow catch wrestler Billy Robinson considered Thesz to be the greatest professional wrestler of all time, saying &quot;everybody respected professional wrestling because of Lou Thesz. He may not have been the best competitive catch wrestler but he was very good in his time.&quot;

Thesz is an inaugural member of several professional wrestling halls of fame, including the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum, Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame, NWA Hall of Fame, WCW Hall of Fame, and the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame which is subsequently named after both one of his trainers along with Thesz himself. On April 2, 2016, Thesz was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as an inaugural member of the &quot;Legacy&quot; wing.

<doc id="668817" wikidata="Q13652117" url="?curid=668817" title="Martin Beck">
<text>Martin Beck is a fictional Swedish police detective and the main character in a series of ten novels by Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, collectively titled &quot;The Story of a Crime&quot;. Frequently referred to as the Martin Beck stories, all have been adapted into films between 1967 and 1994. Six were adapted for the series featuring Gösta Ekman as Martin Beck. 

Between 1997 and 2018 there have also been 38 films (some released direct for video and broadcast on television) based on the characters, with Peter Haber as Martin Beck. Apart from the core duo of Beck and his right-hand man Gunvald Larsson, the latter adaptations bear little resemblance to the plots of the original series. They feature a widely different and evolving cast of characters, though roughly similar themes and settings around Stockholm.

==Series==
During the 1960s and 1970s, Sjöwall and Wahlöö conceived and wrote a series of ten police procedural novels about the exploits of detectives from the special homicide commission of the Swedish national police; in these the character of Martin Beck was the protagonist. (Both authors also wrote novels separately.) For the Martin Beck series, they plotted and researched each book together, and then wrote alternate chapters simultaneously. The books cover ten years and are renowned for extensive character and setting development throughout the series. This is in part due to careful planning by Sjöwall and Wahlöö.

== Characters ==

=== Primary characters ===
Martin Beck: The protagonist of the series, Martin Beck goes from being an unhappily married man and father of two young teenagers, to a divorced man in a happy unmarried relationship with Rhea Nielsen, a kind and emphatic landlady whom Beck meets while investigating the death of a man who was Nielsen&#x27;s tenant. Beck is prone to colds and often suffers from ailments and physical discomforts. Beck also gets several promotions, from Detective to Inspector, and Chief of the National Murder Squad by the end of the series. This seems to be to the chagrin of everyone involved, including him, as he hates the vision of being confined to desk work. In &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, he is happily spared a promotion to a Commissioner. In &quot;The Terrorists,&quot; he is, however, forced to become Chief of Operations in an important job protecting an American senator, meaning that he is for once, in theory, higher in position than his superior, Malm. He is allowed to assemble his perfect team, consisting of Larsson, Rönn, Skacke, Melander and himself. He does extremely well coordinating the desk work and keeping in communication (through allowing Melander to handle all telephone communications, and diverting all telephone calls, or switching off the telephone altogether whenever he needs time to think), impressing the Commissioner. In &quot;The Abominable Man&quot;, he is shot and severely wounded. He quits smoking after the incident as his favourite manufacturer discontinues his preferred type of cigarette.

Lennart Kollberg: Beck&#x27;s most trusted colleague; a sarcastic glutton with a Socialist worldview; served as a paratrooper. After having shot and accidentally killed a person in the line of duty, he refuses to carry a gun. He is newly married in the second book and fathers two children over the course of the series. In &quot;The Fire Engine That Disappeared&quot;, he refers to Gunvald Larsson as &quot;the stupidest detective in the history of criminal investigation&quot;, and in &quot;The Abominable Man&quot;, Larsson informs him, &quot;I&#x27;ve always thought you were a fucking idiot&quot;. Through working with each other on numerous investigations, they later come to understand each other. He resigns from the force at the end of the penultimate book, &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. He realises he was ashamed of what the police force had become, but still has the last word in the last book.
Gunvald Larsson: A former member of the merchant marine and the black sheep of a rich family, he has a liking for expensive clothes and pulp fiction including the work of Sax Rohmer. He is one of the few people outside East Germany who owns and drives a sports car manufactured by Eisenacher Motorenwerk. He is somewhat lacking in interpersonal skills and is disliked by most of his colleagues. He and Kollberg share a mutual antipathy, but are capable of working together efficiently when the occasion demands it. However, although he often treats Einar Rönn with the same boorishness, Rönn is his only friend. The two are close, often spending time together off the job. His rich, cultured family taught him how to behave correctly in all circumstances, something which the Commissioner notes that he tries to conceal. Larsson has a penchant for expensive clothes, and his tailored suits frequently get ruined during his investigations. He is tall and has china blue eyes, and is in extremely good shape. He is noted as the best in the team at breaking down doors.

Einar Rönn: Larsson&#x27;s friend from Arjeplog in the rural north of Sweden, he is married to a Lapp woman. He is permanently red-nosed, incapable of writing a coherent report and totally unimaginative, but a hard-working and efficient policeman. He is very calm and peaceful, losing his temper only once (on Larsson&#x27;s behalf) in all the books. By the end of the series, Beck notes that Rönn had defied all expectations to become a valuable asset to the team, and someone whom he could trust.

Benny Skacke: A young ambitious, overzealous and sometimes hapless detective. He is introduced in the fifth book as a new member of the homicide commission, but later transfers to Malmö for personal reasons. Skacke is still somewhat naïve, seeking to become police commissioner, but he is noted by Beck in the last book as having matured significantly.

Fredrik Melander: Noted for his flawless memory and for always being in the lavatory when anyone wants him. Melander is described as a first-class policeman in &quot;The Fire Engine That Disappeared,&quot; but also as very boring. He insists on getting ten hours of sleep every night and has illegible handwriting. He is noted for having no temper displays and being immune to flattery. He later transfers to the Burglary and Theft division in an effort to avoid overtime. After, he is featured briefly in the later books in the series (except &quot;The Terrorists&quot;). In &quot;the Terrorists&quot;, Beck puts him in charge of telephone communications for his skill in having a long conversation with someone and getting nothing done. 

Evald Hammar: Beck&#x27;s boss until he retires in the end of &quot;The Fire Engine That Disappeared&quot;. He is mild-mannered, trusts his men&#x27;s judgment, and dislikes the political infighting which increasingly accompanies his job.

Stig Malm: Beck&#x27;s boss from &quot;Murder at the Savoy&quot; onwards. A politician with little understanding of police work who is willing to do anything to get up the career ladder, for whom Beck eventually feels sorry by the end of the book. Malm is often ordered around by the National Police Commissioner. He has an overly high opinion of himself, not hampered by his one case as Chief of Operations ending in disaster.

===Other characters===
;Kurt Kvant and Karl Kristiansson: Lazy and inept partner patrolmen from Skåne who are shouted at by Larsson. At one point their trampling all over a crime scene resulted in a lengthy investigation, as no footprints or fingerprints could be taken at the scene. After Kvant is killed in &quot;The Abominable Man&quot;, Kristiansson has a new partner, Kenneth Kvastmo, who is equally inept but far more zealous.

;Per Månsson: A leisurely but very competent Malmö detective who becomes involved in several of Beck&#x27;s cases. He is particularly known for his searching skills.

;Åke Stenström: A young detective noted for his shadowing skills. He is killed in &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot;.

;Åsa Torell: Widow of Åke Stenström, who later decides to become a cop herself. She appears prominently in &quot;Murder at the Savoy&quot; and &quot;The Terrorists&quot;.

===Minor recurring characters===
;Aldor Gustavsson: A mediocre policeman, who bungles the initial investigation in &quot;The Locked Room&quot;.

;Backlund: An unimaginative and rigid detective in Malmö.

;Inga Beck: Martin Beck&#x27;s wife, whom he later divorces.

;Ingrid Beck: Martin Beck&#x27;s daughter, often described as mature and independent. She has a good relationship with her father, and they often go out for dinner together. She urges Beck to leave her mother Inga.

;Rolf Beck: Martin Beck&#x27;s lazy son, with whom he has a poor relationship. Beck finally admits to himself in a later book that he dislikes the boy.

;Rune Ek: One of the detectives. The character is usually minor, but appears more prominently in &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot;.

;Emil Elofsson and Gustav Borglund: Two partner patrolmen in Malmö. They appear in &quot;The Fire Engine that Disappeared&quot; and &quot;Cop Killer&quot;. In the later book, Borglund is killed by a wasp.

;Norman Hansson: A uniformed police sergeant in some of the books.

;Oskar Hjelm: A highly skilled but vain and temperamental forensic scientist, who is highly susceptible to flattery. Beck uses this weakness on a daily basis.

;Gun Kollberg: Kollberg&#x27;s young wife and mother of his two children.

;Rhea Nielsen: Martin Beck&#x27;s new girlfriend after he divorces his wife. She is an open socialist, and enjoys cooking. The series ends with Kollberg and his wife Gun, and Beck and Nielson having a happy New Years&#x27; party, in a perfect atmosphere with Nielsen&#x27;s delicious cooking. She is a landlady, having inherited a block of apartments. Unlike many other landlords, she takes good care of the property, and builds a social community around her apartments. She charges less rent than average, and has them well refurbished. She meets Beck in &quot;The Locked Room&quot;, as the ex-landlady of the deceased man. Intelligent and straight-talking, she is a professional social worker.

;Herrgott Nöjd (Herrgott Allwright or Herrgott Content in English translations): A down-to-earth police officer from the rural district of Anderslöv, who gets on well with just about anybody. Appears in the books &quot;Cop Killer&quot; and &quot;The Terrorists&quot;.

;Sten Robert &quot;Bulldozer&quot; Olsson: A very busy, energetic and enthusiastic public prosecutor in charge of investigating and prosecuting bank robbers. He has a big part in &quot;The Locked Room&quot;, where several fiascos occur under his watch when he insists on personally overseeing the investigation. He is known for being so busy, with often 10 cases at once, that he never appeals a case after losing, which he rarely does. 

;Strömgren: A Stockholm detective with a minor role in some of the books. Little is known about him, but he is disliked by both Beck and Larsson. In &quot;The Terrorists&quot; he apparently is a spy for Bulldozer Olsson.

;Richard Ullholm: A pedantic and nit-picking detective in some of the books. He is constantly making official complaints about his colleagues over usually minor details.

;Bo Zachrisson: Another mediocre policeman, who appears in &quot;The Fire Engine That Disappeared&quot; and later lets the Prime Minister get assassinated in &quot;The Terrorists&quot;. Eric Möller, the chief of Security Police, mistakes Larsson&#x27;s &quot;CS&quot; (meaning Clod Squad) list of policemen who should not be used for any important duties, as the &quot;Commando Section&quot;.

== Film adaptations ==
All ten novels have been adapted to film. Some have been released under different titles and four have been filmed outside Sweden. The first actor to play Martin Beck was Keve Hjelm in 1967. Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt portrayed Beck in 1976. 

In 1993 and 1994, Gösta Ekman played the character in six films. American audiences are likely most familiar with Walter Matthau playing the Beck role in the 1973 film called &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot;, where his character was called &quot;Jake Martin.&quot; 

Martin Beck has also been played by Jan Decleir, Derek Jacobi and Romualds Ancāns. Two of the novels, &quot;Roseanna&quot; and &quot;Murder at the Savoy&quot;, have each twice been adapted for films. In the later TV series films based more on the named characters than events, Martin Beck is played by Peter Haber.

== Impact ==
Sjöwall and Wahlöö&#x27;s technique of mixing traditional crime fiction with a focus on the social issues in the Swedish welfare state received a great deal of attention. The concept has been updated in the 1990s with Henning Mankell&#x27;s detective character Kurt Wallander and in the 2000s with Stieg Larsson&#x27;s &quot;Millennium&quot; trilogy featuring Lisbeth Salander. The basic concept has, by extension, given rise to the entire Scandinavian noir scene. The Mystery Writers of America, in 1995, rated &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; as the 2nd best police procedural, after Tony Hillerman&#x27;s &quot;Dance Hall of the Dead&quot;.

<text>Robert Frederick Paulsen III (born March 11, 1956) is an American voice actor and voice director, known for his roles in numerous animated television series and films. He received a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program and three Annie Awards for his role as both Yakko and Pinky in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; franchise. His other voice roles include Hadji in &quot;The New Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; (1986–1987) and &quot;The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; (1996–1997); Raphael in &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; (1987–1996); P.J. Pete in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; (1992), &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot; (1995), and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot; (2000); Jaq in &quot;Cinderella II: Dreams Come True&quot; (2002) and &quot;Cinderella III: A Twist in Time&quot; (2007); and Mac in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; (2011–2013) and &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot; (2015).

==Early life==
Robert Frederick Paulsen III was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 11, 1956, the son of Bob and Lee Paulsen. He was raised in Grand Blanc, Michigan, where he graduated from Grand Blanc High School in 1974. He sang in choirs throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in school, but his childhood idol was ice hockey player Gordie Howe, and he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice due to his primary interest in becoming a National Hockey League (NHL) player. He briefly attended the University of Michigan-Flint, but later dropped out and moved to Los Angeles in 1978 to pursue a career in show business, much to the disapproval of his father. He worked his first job as a musician, before pursuing voice acting full time.

==Career==
Paulsen first voice acting role came in 1983 with the mini-series &quot;G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero&quot;, where he played Snow Job and Tripwire. A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as Cobra Slavemaster and reprising Snow Job and Tripwire on &quot;G.I. Joe&quot;, Corky on &quot;The Snorks&quot;, Marco Smurf on the later seasons of &quot;The Smurfs&quot;, Boober in &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, Hadji in &quot;The New Adventures of Jonny Quest&quot; and the title character Saber Rider and the villain Jesse Blue on &quot;Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs&quot;.

During the 1980s, Paulsen also explored the field of live action films. His first film was &quot;Eyes of Fire&quot; in 1983. He played supporting roles in &quot;Body Double&quot;, &quot;Stewardess School&quot;, &quot;Warlock&quot;, and &quot;Mutant on the Bounty&quot;. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as &quot;MacGyver&quot; and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;. 
Paulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s, he had been the announcer for the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of Mr. Opportunity, spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for &quot;Buffalo Dick&#x27;s Radio Ranch&quot;, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West Coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998. He provided the voice of Dog in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of Nacho the cat.

However, Paulsen&#x27;s most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous Got Milk? campaign. The famous commercial, &quot;Who shot Alexander Hamilton in that famous duel?&quot;, aired in 1993, and launched the &quot;Got Milk?&quot; campaign into a successful enterprise. Paulsen continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry. He can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mr. Mini-Wheat in the Mini-Wheats commercials in Canada.

From 1987 to 1995, Paulsen voiced Raphael and various supporting characters in the original 1987 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series. Originally starting as a five-part miniseries, the series continued for ten seasons and 193 episodes. It was a great success and became an instant pop culture symbol. Paulsen has said that Raphael&#x27;s voice is very similar to his natural voice.

He returned to the franchise as Donatello for the 2012 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series on Nickelodeon, which ran for five seasons and 124 episodes from September 29, 2012, until November 12, 2017. He also reprised his role as 1987 Raphael in the multiple 1987/2012 crossover episodes.

Paulsen serves as the voice director for the subsequent series, &quot;Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, which premiered in July 2018.
Throughout the early 1990s, Paulsen continued to co-star in animated series, which allowed him to branch further into radio and television announcements and dropped live action acting from his repertoire. In 1993, he voiced &quot;Antoine Depardieu&quot; in ABC&#x27;s series &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, and &quot;Arthur&quot;, an insecure accountant in a moth costume (wings included), in the superhero series &quot;The Tick&quot; in 1995, replacing Micky Dolenz, who had originally played Arthur.

In 1993, he starred as the title character in both &quot;Mighty Max&quot; and &quot;The Mask&quot;. Also at this time, he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, Yakko Warner of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. Paulsen also provided the voice of Pinky from both &quot;Animaniacs&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;, a show which won him several Annie Awards and a Daytime Emmy in 1999. He also did a number of characters in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, including &quot;Fowlmouth&quot;, &quot;Arnold the Pit Bull&quot;, and &quot;Concord Condor&quot;. In the direct-to-video film &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation&quot;, he did the voices for Banjo Possum, Mr. Hitcher (who would also appear in other episodes), and Johnny Pew. 
Paulsen continues to voice Yakko and Pinky in the 2020 &quot;Animaniacs&quot; revival on Hulu.

Paulsen has also provided voices for numerous other characters, including Steelbeak in &quot;Darkwing Duck&quot;, Brick and Boomer in &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, Experiment 625 / Reuben and several of Jumba Jookiba&#x27;s other genetic experiments in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot; and its films &quot;Stitch! The Movie&quot; and &quot;Leroy &amp; Stitch&quot;, Atchan in &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;, Spooky the Tuff Little Ghost in &quot;The Spooktacular New Adventures of Casper&quot;, Ogden O. Ostrich in &quot;Channel Umptee-3&quot;, Hathi in &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, Jack Fenton, The Box Ghost, Nicolai Technus, and The Vulture Ghosts in &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, Carl Wheezer, Butch and Skeet in &quot;The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron, Boy Genius&quot;, Mark Chang, his father King Grippulon, Happy Peppy Gary, and Bucky McBadbat in &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;, Peck the Rooster in &quot;Barnyard&quot; and &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, and Gordon in &quot;Catscratch&quot;.

Pete in &quot;Goof Troop&quot;, &quot;A Goofy Movie&quot;, and &quot;An Extremely Goofy Movie&quot;, as well as the voices of Ratchet and Dr. Debolt in the &quot;TaleSpin&quot; pilot television film &quot;Plunder &amp; Lightning&quot;. He also did the voices of Boober Fraggle, Sprocket, and Marjory the Trash Heap in the animated version of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, as well as Gwizdo in the Dragon Hunters film.

He also voiced Zeek and Joshua in &quot;K10C: Kids&#x27; Ten Commandments&quot;, Rude Dog in &quot;Rude Dog and the Dweebs&quot;, and Archie the Raccoon, A.K.A. Ze Archer, in &quot;Mask of the Raccoon&quot; on &quot;The Penguins of Madagascar&quot;. and also provided the voices of 2T Fru-T and Mike Ellis in the 2001 cartoon series &quot;Butt-Ugly Martians&quot;.

He portrayed the voice of Chomper and Strut in &quot;The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure&quot;, Spike and Rinkus in &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; sequels and Spike in the TV series, but Spike was played anonymously in the original &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;.

He has recently started doing &quot;Rob Paulsen Live&quot; seminars across the U.S. to talk of his career, sign autographs, and talk with fans. Sometimes, people in attendance would request him to sing the famous &quot;Yakko&#x27;s World&quot; number, where he sings all the nations of the world with his Yakko voice in a fast-paced delivery without rehearsing.

In May 2011, working with social media and web producer Chris Pope, Paulsen rolled out a new website RobPaulsenLive.com, as well as a weekly audio podcast called &quot;Talkin&#x27; Toons with Rob Paulsen&quot;, which started out being managed and deployed by The Tech Jives Network, before moving to be part of Nerdist Industries&#x27; Nerdist Podcast Network. Some episodes were recorded before a live audience at The Improv in Hollywood, California, while later ones were recorded at the Nerdist Showroom. The show is on indefinite hiatus following the March 23, 2019 episode with Dante Basco.

In June 2011, Paulsen made announcements that he was taking his show on the road with his &quot;Lots of laughs and autographs&quot; tour. Working closely with a team that included Chris Pope, his publicist, and others he made his first successful tour in Atlanta, Georgia, which happened on July 30, 2011, and another in Dallas, Texas on September 17, 2011, that required two seminars, one in the afternoon and one in the evening, as they were so popular.

==Personal life==
He married his first wife, Carol Anne Schnarr on June 23, 1979. They divorced in 1982. 
He married his second wife, photographer Parrish Todd, in 1983. Together, they have a son. He lives in Agoura Hills, California with his family.

Paulsen has long supported various charities and raised donations for cancer research. He has worked a lot for GOALmodels, a program for adolescents, and is a sponsor of Camp Will-A-Way, a camp for children with developmental disabilities. He also donates funds from autographs to the Wounded Warrior Project and Operation Smile. In February 2016, he was diagnosed with stage III throat cancer. He has since undergone treatment and his cancer went in remission. Following his battle with cancer, he wrote a memoir called &quot;Voice Lessons: How a Couple of Ninja Turtles, Pinky, and an Animaniac Saved My Life&quot;.

<text>Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), previously known as menorrhagia or hematomunia, is a menstrual period with excessively heavy flow. It is a type of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).
Abnormal uterine bleeding can be caused by structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract, skipping ovulation (anovulation), bleeding disorders, hormonal issues (such as hypothyroidism) or cancer of the reproductive tract.

Initial evaluation during diagnosis aims at determining pregnancy status, menopausal status, and the source of bleeding. One definition for diagnosing the condition is bleeding lasting more than 7 days or the loss of more than 80 mL of blood heavy flow.
Treatment depends on the cause, severity, and interference with quality of life. Initial treatment often involve birth control pills. Tranexamic acid, danazol, hormonal intrauterine device, and painkillers (NSAIDs) are also helpful. Surgery can be an effective for those whose symptoms are not well-controlled with other treatments. Approximately 53 in 1000 women are affected by AUB.

==Signs and symptoms==

A normal menstrual cycle is 21–35 days in duration, with bleeding lasting an average of 5 days and total blood flow between 25 and 80 mL. Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as total menstrual flow &gt;80ml per cycle, soaking a pad/tampon at least every 2 hours, changing a pad/tampon in the middle of the night, or bleeding lasting for &gt;7 days. Deviations in terms of frequency of menses, duration of menses, or volume of menses qualifies as abnormal uterine bleeding. Bleeding in between menses, outside reproductive age, or after sex is also abnormal uterine bleeding and thus requires further evaluation.

== Causes ==
Usually, no causative abnormality can be identified and treatment is directed at the symptom, rather than a specific mechanism. However, there are known causes of abnormal uterine bleeding that need to be ruled out. Most common causes based on the nature of bleeding is listed below followed by the rare causes of bleeding (i.e. disorders of coagulation).

* Excessive menses but normal cycle:
** Painless:
*** Fibroids (leiomyoma) — fibroids in the wall of the uterus cause increased menstrual loss if they protrude into the central cavity and thereby increase endometrial surface area.
*** Coagulation defects (rare) — with the shedding of an endometrial lining&#x27;s blood vessels, normal coagulation process must occur to limit and eventually stop the blood flow. Blood disorders of platelets (such as ITP) or coagulation (such as von Willebrand disease) or use of anticoagulant medication (such as warfarin) are therefore possible causes, although a rare minority of cases. Platelet function studies can also be used to ascertain platelet function abnormalities
*** Endometrial cancer (cancer of the uterine lining) — bleeding can also be irregular, in between periods, or after the menopause (post-menopausal bleeding or PMB)
*** Endometrial polyp
** Painful (i.e. associated with dysmenorrhea):
*** Pelvic inflammatory disease
*** Adenomyosis - extension of the endometrial tissue into the outer muscular wall of the uterus which can cause pain and abnormal bleeds when the endometrium sheds
*** Pregnancy related complication (i.e. miscarriage)
* Short cycle (less than 21 days) but normal menses.
* Short cycle and excessive menses due to ovarian dysfunction and may be secondary to blockage of blood vessels by tumours.
* Polycystic ovary syndrome.
* Systemic causes: thyroid disease, excessive emotional/physical stress.
* Sexually transmitted infection.
* Copper intrauterine device

==Pathophysiology==
HMB is associated with increased omega-6 AA in uterine tissues. The endometrium of people with HMB have higher levels of prostaglandin (E2, F2alpha and others) when compared with women with normal menses. It is thought that prostaglandins are a by product of omega 6 build up. Furthermore, prostaglandins have been found to trigger abnormal, painful uterine contractions, making it a source for targeted therapy.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is largely achieved by obtaining a complete medical history followed by physical exam and vaginal ultrasonography. If need be, laboratory tests or hysteroscopy may be used. The following are a list of diagnostic procedures that medical professionals may use to identify the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding.
* Pelvic and rectal examination to ensure that bleeding is not from lower reproductive tract (i.e. vagina, cervix) or rectum
* Pap smear to rule out cervical neoplasia
* Pelvic ultrasound scan is the first line diagnostic tool for identifying structural abnormalities.
* Endometrial biopsy in those with high risk endometrial cancer or atypical hyperplasia or malignancy.
* Sonohysterography to assess for abnormalities within the uterine lining
* Hysteroscopy (anaesthesia should be offered)
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyrotropin-releasing hormone dosage to rule out hypothyroidism 
In the UK, the NICE guidelines states that: &quot;Many women presenting to primary care with symptoms of HMB can be offered treatment without the need for further examination or investigation. However, investigation via a diagnostic technique might be warranted for women for whom history or examination suggests a structural or endometrial pathology or for whom the initial treatment has failed.&quot;

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on identified underlying cause and varies between medication, radiation, and surgery. Heavy periods at menarche and menopause may settle spontaneously (the menarche being the start and menopause being the cessation of periods).

If the degree of bleeding is mild, all that may be sought is the reassurance that there is no sinister underlying cause. If anemia occurs due to bleeding then iron tablets may be used to help restore normal hemoglobin levels.

The first line treatment option for those with HMB and no identified pathology, fibroids less than 3 cm in diameter, and/or suspected or confirmed adenomyosis is the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS). Clinical trial evidence suggests that the LNG-IUS may be better than other medical therapy in terms of HMB and quality of life.

Usually, oral combined contraceptive or progesterone only pills may be taken for a few months, but for longer-term treatment the alternatives of injected Depo Provera or the more recent progesterone releasing IntraUterine System (IUS) may be used. In particular, an oral contraceptive containing estradiol valerate and dienogest may be more effective than tranexamic acid, NSAIDs and IUDs. Fibroids may respond to hormonal treatment, and if they do not, then radiation or surgical removal may be required.
In the UK, regarding hormonal treatment, the NICE guidelines states that: &quot;No evidence was found on MRI-guided transcutaneous focused ultrasound for uterine fibroids nor for the progestogen-only pill, injectable progestogens, or progestogen implants.&quot; Progestogen pills, independently if taken in a short or long course, are not as effective at reducing menstrual blood loss as LNG-IUS or tranexamic acid.

Tranexamic acid treatments, which reduce bleeding by inhibiting the clot-dissolving enzymes, appear to be more effective than anti-inflammatory treatment like NSAIDs, but are less effective than LNG-IUS. Tranexamic acid tablets may reduce loss by up to 50%. This may be combined with hormonal medication previously mentioned.

NSAIDs are also used to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding by an average of 20-46% through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. For this purpose, NSAIDs are taken for only 5 days of the menstrual cycle, limiting their most common adverse effect of dyspepsia.
In the UK, NICE guidelines says that for individuals with HMB and no identified pathology or fibroids less than 3 cm in diameter who do not wish to have pharmacological treatment and who do not want to conserve their fertility, surgical options could be considered as a first-line treatment option. Options include a hysterectomy and second generation endometrial ablation, with hysterectomy being more effective than second generation endometrial ablation.
A definitive treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding is to perform hysterectomy (removal of the uterus). The risks of the procedure have been reduced with measures to minimize the risk of deep vein thrombosis after surgery, and the switch from the front abdominal to vaginal approach greatly minimizing the discomfort and recuperation time for the patient; however extensive fibroids may make the womb too large for removal by the vaginal approach. Small fibroids may be dealt with by local removal (myomectomy). A further surgical technique is endometrial ablation (destruction) by the use of applied heat (thermoablation). The effectiveness of endometrial ablation is probably similar to that of LNG‐IUS but the evidence is uncertain if hysterectomy is better or worse than LNG-IUS for improving HMB.

===Medications===

These have been ranked by the UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence:
* First line
** Intrauterine device with progesterone
* Second Line
** Tranexamic acid an antifibrinolytic agent
** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
** Combined oral contraceptive pills to prevent proliferation of the endometrium
* Third line
** Oral progestogen (e.g. norethisterone), to prevent proliferation of the endometrium
** Injected progestogen (e.g. Depo provera)
* Other options
** Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist

===Surgery===
* Dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) is not recommended for cases of simple heavy menstrual bleeding, having a reserved role if a spontaneous abortion is incomplete
* Endometrial ablation is not recommended for women with active or recent genital or pelvic infection, known or suspected endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy.
* Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a common treatment with the etiology of a leiomyoma. The rate of serious complications is comparable to that of myomectomy or hysterectomy; however, UAE presents an increased risk of minor complications and requiring surgery within two to five years.
* Hysteroscopic myomectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove leiomyomas (otherwise known as fibroids). Though a safe and effective mode of treating for menstrual disorders but it is unclear whether or not it is beneficial for treating infertility.
* Hysterectomy is a surgical procedure consisting of the full removal of the uterus, and can include the removal of fallopian tubes (otherwise known as the uterine tubes), cervix and ovaries.

In the UK the use of hysterectomy for heavy menstrual bleeding has been almost halved between 1989 and 2003. This has a number of causes: better medical management, endometrial ablation and particularly the introduction of IUS which may be inserted in the community and avoid the need for specialist referral; in one study up to 64% of women cancelled surgery.

==Complications==
Previous studies have suggested a nontrivial reduction in the quality of life in individuals with HMB; however, there is no single metric that has been shown to be specific enough to measure health-related quality of life in individuals with HMB. HMB can take a significant toll on the physical, psychological, and social aspects of individuals&#x27; lives. For example, a large, cross-sectional study in the United States identified significant associations between HMB and lower employment rates, lost earnings, and a lower self-rating of overall health compared to the general population. Physical and social issues, including performance of house work, life causing embarrassment, and social life, have also been identified as significant reasons why individuals with HMB seek help. While the main impacts of HMB are primarily physical and social, previous studies have also identified an inverse relationship between HMB and psychological scores.

Aside from the social distress of dealing with a prolonged and heavy period, over time the blood loss may prove to be greater than the body iron reserves or the rate of blood replenishment, leading to anemia. Symptoms attributable to the anemia may include shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness, tingling and numbness in fingers and toes, headaches, depression, becoming cold more easily, and poor concentration.

== Research ==
Both the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and medications (tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, contraceptive pill with combined oestrogen–progestogen or progesterone alone) seem to be equally effective in reducing the impact of HMB.

<doc id="668835" wikidata="Q6510646" url="?curid=668835" title="Indefinite leave to remain">
<text>Indefinite leave to remain (ILR) is an immigration status granted to a person who does not hold the right of abode in the United Kingdom (UK), but who has been admitted to the UK without any time limit on their stay and who is free to take up employment, engage in business, self-employment, or study. When indefinite leave is granted to persons outside the United Kingdom it is known as indefinite leave to enter (ILE). 

It approximates to the concept of permanent residency (PR) in other countries, but that term had a different and specific meaning under the EU law on freedom of movement while the UK was in the EU. ILR is granted under UK domestic legislation, PR was (before Brexit) acquired automatically, if certain conditions were met, under EU law.

A person who has indefinite leave to remain, the right of abode or Irish citizenship has settled status if resident in the United Kingdom (all full British citizens have the right of abode). A person with indefinite leave to remain is eligible for access to public funds and welfare in the UK.

Settled status is central to British nationality law, as the most usual route to naturalisation or registration as a British citizen requires that the applicant be settled in the UK. Settled status is also important where a child of non-British citizen parents is born in the UK, as unless at least one parent has settled status the child will not automatically be a British citizen.

A person who is resident in the UK under the Work or Family route will be able to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain after completing qualifying period of legal stay in the UK.

Indefinite leave can lapse where the holder has stayed outside the United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than two years. It is retained indefinitely if the holder remains resident in the UK with limited absences.

==Advantages==

===Acquisition of British citizenship===

Holders of ILR may apply for British citizenship if they have held ILR for twelve months or longer, are over 18 and have been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the last five years.

Certain ILR holders may apply for British citizenship under the registration clauses if they are qualified to do so (e.g., born in the UK or holding another form of British nationality). Registration normally costs less than naturalisation and applicants are not required to meet knowledge and language requirements.

===Children born in the UK===

A child born in the United Kingdom after 1983 to persons who are not British citizens will not automatically be a British citizen.

Prior to 1 July 2006, only a legitimate child (born to parents who are married to each other) could automatically derive British citizenship from the father, if the father was a British citizen or &quot;settled&quot; in the United Kingdom. However, if the parents are not married when the child is born in the United Kingdom, but then get married, and the marriage legitimates the child, then if the father was a British citizen or &quot;settled&quot; in the UK when the child was born, the child would become a British citizen and would be regarded as having been one from the date of marriage. This affects only children where the mother is neither a British citizen nor &quot;settled&quot; in the UK.

For children born on or after 1 July 2006, an unmarried father has broadly equivalent rights (compared with a married father) to pass on British citizenship to a child.

Where a child would be a British citizen but for the fact that the parents are not married, the Home Office will usually register the child as a British citizen under section 3(1) of the British Nationality Act provided that the child is still under 18.

If ILR is acquired after the child&#x27;s birth, the child will not automatically be a British citizen. However the child can be registered as a British citizen under s1(3) of the British Nationality Act 1981 provided application is made before the age of 18. Alternatively, if the child lives in the UK until age 10, they will have a lifetime entitlement to registration as a British citizen under s1(4) of the Act.

Children born in the United Kingdom before 1983 are British citizens regardless of the immigration status of their parents (unless the father was at the time of the child&#x27;s birth a diplomat accredited to the United Kingdom).

===Public funds===

Unlike people with Limited Leave to Remain (LTR) in the UK, ILR holders have access to public funds. &quot;No recourse to public funds&quot; is not written in ILR holders&#x27; visas. As a result, they are able to claim job seekers&#x27; allowances and other benefits that are usually available only to British and Irish citizens (and those with “settled” status).

===Home student status===
ILR holders pay home student rates (i.e. the same rate as British and Irish citizens) for study at higher education institutions in the UK. That is, they are not charged as international students, unlike LTR visa holders, if they want to study courses in any UK institutions.

===Right to stand in elections===
Commonwealth citizens who have ILR and are resident in the UK have the right to vote and stand as candidates in all elections.

== Acquisition of ILR ==

ILR can be acquired in a number of ways.

=== No residence ===
A child (including an adopted child) aged under 18 who holds leave to enter or remain with a view to settlement with a parent, parents or a relative who is a settled person and resident in the UK can apply for ILR using Form SET(F).

A parent, grandparent or other dependant relative aged 18 or over of a person who is a settled person and resident in the UK can apply for ILR using Form SET(F).

People satisfying all of the below criteria can apply for ILR using Form SET(DV):
* were given permission to come to the UK for up to 27 months or to extend his/her stay for two years as the husband, wife, civil partner, unmarried partner or same-sex partner of a permanent resident (even if that permission is no longer valid)
* were still in that relationship at the time they came to the UK or extended their stay as their husband, wife, civil partner, unmarried partner or same-sex partner
* can produce evidence that the relationship has broken down permanently since then as a result of domestic violence.

=== 2 years&#x27; residence ===
A person who has lived in the UK for 2 years with temporary permission to remain in the UK as the husband, wife, civil partner or unmarried/same-sex partner of a British citizen or a settled person and who intends to continue living together (and are still married or in a civil partnership, if applicable) can apply for ILR using Form SET(M), as long as he/she arrived in the UK or applied for permission to stay in the UK on or before 8 July 2012.

Note that a person living in the UK as the husband, wife, civil partner or unmarried/same-sex partner of a British citizen or a settled person who either arrives in the UK or applies for permission to stay in the UK on or after 9 July 2012 must live in the UK for 5 years (and not 2 years) to obtain ILR (see below).

=== 4 years&#x27; residence ===
*A person who has lived in the UK for 4 years with a visa issued before 3 April 2006 under the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) and Employment Not Requiring Work Permit can apply for ILR using Form SET(O).
*A commonwealth citizen who has served in the British Armed Forces for a minimum of four years: after leaving the Army can apply for ILR using Form SET(AF).

=== 5 years&#x27; residence ===
A person who has lived in the UK for 5 years with a visa issued in one of the following categories can apply for ILR using Form SET(O):
* Tier 1 or Tier 2 of the points-based system (excluding the Post-study work category of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Intra-company Transfer)
* work permit
* businessperson
* innovator
* investor
* representative of an overseas newspaper, news agency or broadcasting organisation
* private servant in a diplomatic household
* domestic worker in a private household
* overseas government employee
* minister of religion, missionary or member of a religious order
* airport-based operational staff of an overseas-owned airline
* self-employed lawyer
* writer, composer or artist
* UK ancestry
* highly skilled migrant under the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP)
* Hong Kong BN(O)

A person who has lived in the UK for 5 years with a visa issued in one of the following categories can apply for ILR using Form SET(BUS):
* retired person of independent means
* sole representative of an overseas firm.

A person who has been granted humanitarian protection since 30 August 2005 and whose current 5-year permission to stay is due to expire can apply for ILR using Form SET (Protection Route).

A person who has lived in the UK for 5 years under the Gateway Protection Programme can apply for ILR using Form HPDL.

A person who has lived in the UK for 5 years with temporary permission to remain in the UK as the husband, wife, civil partner or unmarried/same-sex partner of a British citizen or a settled person and who intends to continue living together (and are still married or in a civil partnership, if applicable) can apply for ILR, as long as he/she arrived in the UK or applied for permission to stay in the UK on or after 9 July 2012. For those who arrived in the UK or applied for permission to stay in the UK on or before 8 July 2012, a 2-year period of residence (instead of 5 years) applies (see above).

=== 6 years&#x27; residence ===
A person who has lived in the UK for 6 years with Discretionary Leave can apply for ILR using SET(O). Form HPDL was used as an alternative depending on circumstance but this practice has now ceased.

=== 10 years&#x27; residence ===

A person who has lived in the UK for 10 years continuously can apply for ILR on the ground of &#x27;long residence&#x27; using Form SET(LR) as long as all time spent in the UK during the 10 years has been lawful, and he/she has not left the UK for more than 540 calendar days in total (18 months), or more than 180 calendar days (6 months) at one time. In &#x27;compelling or compassionate circumstances&#x27;, the Home Office can exercise discretion over any excess absences over the threshold. If the person has gaps in lawful residence during the 10-year period, ILR can still be granted as long as each gap did not exceed 28 days and ended before 24 November 2016, or in &#x27;exceptional circumstances&#x27; where the gap exceeded 28 days, or where there was a &#x27;good reason beyond the control of the applicant or their representative&#x27; if the gap did not exceed 14 days and ended on or after 24 November 2016.

=== 7 years&#x27; residence ===

A person aged under 18 who has lived in the UK for 7 years continuously (lawfully or unlawfully, but discounting any period of imprisonment) can apply for leave to remain on the grounds of private life using Form FLR(FP) if it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the UK. During the 7-year period of continuous residence, the person must not have left the UK for more than 540 calendar days in total (18 months), or more than 180 calendar days (6 months) at one time. After living in the UK for 10 years continuously (holding leave to remain on the grounds of private life during this period), he/she can apply for ILR.

=== 19–22.5 years&#x27; residence ===

A person aged between 18 and 25 who has lived in the UK for at least half of his/her life (lawfully or unlawfully, but discounting any period of imprisonment) can apply for leave to remain on the grounds of private life using Form FLR(FP). During the period of continuous residence, the person must not have not left the UK for more than 540 calendar days in total (18 months), or more than 180 calendar days (6 months) at one time. After living in the UK for 10 years continuously (holding leave to remain on the grounds of private life during this period), he/she can apply for ILR.

=== 20 years&#x27; residence ===

A person who has lived in the UK for 20 years continuously (lawfully or unlawfully, but discounting any period of imprisonment) can apply for leave to remain on the grounds of private life using Form FLR(FP). During the 20-year period of continuous residence, the person must not have not left the UK for more than 540 calendar days in total (18 months), or more than 180 calendar days (6 months) at one time. After living in the UK for a further 10 years continuously (holding leave to remain on the grounds of private life during this period), he/she can apply for ILR.

Alternatively, a person who has lived in the UK for &quot;less than&quot; 20 years continuously (lawfully or unlawfully, but discounting any period of imprisonment), but faces very significant obstacles to integrating into the country to which he/she would have to go if required to leave the UK, can apply for leave to remain on the grounds of private life using Form FLR(FP). During the period of continuous residence, the person must not have not left the UK for more than 540 calendar days in total (18 months), or more than 180 calendar days (6 months) at one time. After living in the UK for a further 10 years continuously (holding leave to remain on the grounds of private life during this period), he/she can apply for ILR.

=== Outside the Immigration Rules ===
UK Visas and Immigration has discretion to grant ILRs outside the Immigration Rules (leaves outside the rules; LOTR) either where someone qualifies under one of the immigration policy concessions or for reasons that are particularly compelling in circumstance and it is almost certain that there will be no change in circumstances within five years.

== Costs ==

Prior to 2003, Indefinite Leave to Remain in the UK was free. However, since 2003, fees have been introduced and have risen each year in April. ILR Fees were introduced at £155 in 2003. Following record immigration in 2004–05, mainly from Eastern Europe, for the main applicant the fee was raised in 2005 to £335, in 2007 to £750, and in 2009 to £820.

In 2009 the Government introduced a £70 million Migrants Impact Fund. Economic migrants and students coming to the UK from outside the EU are charged a £50 levy in addition to their normal visa application fee. The fund is used to support the communities in which they live. A fee was also introduced for dependent applicants, at £50 each. In 2009 Premium Applications with an in-person appointment at a regional office were introduced at a cost to the applicant of £1,020.

In 2010/11 the application fee was raised to £840 (£1,095 premium) including the Migrants Impact Levy. The dependents fee was also increased to £129 each.

In August 2010, the new government scrapped the Migrants Impact Fund. However, the levy is still charged; the extra income &quot;will now contribute to the cost of the visa and will mitigate increases that the Government would otherwise have had to make.&quot;

On 6 April 2011, the application fee was raised to £972 (£1,350 premium) including the Migrants Impact Levy. The dependents fee was also increased to £486 (£675 premium) each.

From 6 April 2012, the application fee was raised to £991 (£1,377 premium) including the Migrants Impact Levy. The dependents fee was also increased to £496 (£689 premium) each.

From 6 April 2015, the application fee was raised to £1,500 (£1,900 premium).

From 6 April 2016, the application fee was raised to £1,875 (£2,375 premium) per person (dependants also pay the same fees).

From 6 April 2017, the application fee was raised to £2,297 (£2,848 premium) per person (dependants also pay the same fees).

From 6 April 2018, the application fee was raised slightly to £2,389 (£2,999 premium) per person (dependants also pay the same fees).

== Citizens of EEA member states ==
Before 2021, citizens of countries in the European Economic Area and Swiss citizens could obtain permanent residence status automatically after five years&#x27; residence in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty rights rather than ILR. The rights of EEA citizens are not governed by UK Immigration Regulations, but rather the EEA Regulations.

Under the law as it existed between 2 October 2000 and 29 April 2006, a citizen of an EEA state or Switzerland could be granted permanent residence on an application after four years&#x27; residence in the United Kingdom exercising Treaty rights (five years from 3 April 2006). Prior to 2 October 2000, citizens of EEA states were deemed to be permanent residents immediately upon taking up residence in the UK to exercise Treaty rights.

The change in the law in 2000 was retroactive. Hence, for example, a French citizen who arrived to work in the UK on 1 July 1986 would have been treated as a permanent resident between that date and 1 October 2000. From 2 October 2000, the status would revert to that of a temporary resident if an application for ILR was not made. On 30 April 2006, with five years&#x27; residence exercising Treaty rights accrued, that person regained permanent resident status.

===Post-Brexit status changes and the EU Settlement Scheme===

In 2018, the UK government has indicated that a new immigration status would be created for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens with settled status due to the fact that their permanent residence status would lapse following Brexit. The first version of the new scheme was unveiled in October 2018 while the full operation of the scheme would only start when the UK leaves the EU. On 1 November 2018, the Home Office launched a limited pilot of the scheme for certain persons working in higher education, health care or social care sectors and having access to an Android device. Under Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules, this new immigration status was confirmed as &quot;&#x27;Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the United Kingdom&quot;&#x27; although citizens with the status would receive no physical documentation confirming this status.

The second version of the European Union Settlement Scheme was launched in 2019 by the Home Office to process the registration of EU citizens resident in the United Kingdom prior to its departure from the European Union. Applicants to the Scheme do not have to pay anything to apply, and if successful, receive one of two statuses, dependent on a number of eligibility criteria, most notably time spent before applying resident in the United Kingdom:- &#x27;Settled status&#x27; or &#x27;Pre-settled status&#x27;.

Citizens resident in the UK prior to 31 December 2020 and exercising Treaty rights for a continuous period exceeding five years (&#x27;continuous residence&#x27;) will usually receive settled status. Those without five years of continuous residence at the point of application will typically receive &#x27;pre-settled status&#x27;. Upon achieving five years of continuous residence, citizens with &#x27;pre-settled status&#x27; may apply for &#x27;settled status&#x27;. Pre-settled status lapses five years from the point at which it is granted.

Citizens who have been granted &#x27;settled status&#x27; under the Scheme, formally Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) under Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules are able to remain in the UK as long as they wish, subject to conditions. Those with settled status retain the same rights to employment, welfare, education and public funds as previously.

Citizens with &#x27;settled status&#x27; may spend up to exactly five continuous years outside the United Kingdom without affecting their immigration status, and will lose their &#x27;settled status&#x27; if they spend any continuous time longer than five years and a day outside the UK.

Close family members may join citizens with &#x27;settled status&#x27; before 31 December 2020, or 31 of December 2025 for the spouses and civil partners of Swiss citizens; these close family members must register on the Scheme when they become resident.

Children born in the UK to parents, at least one of whom is a citizen with &#x27;settled status&#x27; at the time of the child&#x27;s birth, automatically have British citizenship from birth. Children born in the UK, at least one of whose parents acquire &#x27;settled status&#x27; after the child&#x27;s birth, have an entitlement to acquire British citizenship before the child&#x27;s 18th birthday.

Irish citizens will continue to benefit from the freedom of movement and will not be affected by Brexit due to the fact that the Common Travel Area agreement were signed before the UK&#x27;s European Community membership and hence cannot be affected by UK&#x27;s withdrawal from EU regulations.

==Immigration rule changes==

===HC 1016===

With effect from 3 April 2006, the period of time required to obtain Indefinite Leave to Remain increases to five years. These changes were debated in House of Commons Standing Committee on 20 June 2006. All Labour MPs voted for preserving the retroactive aspect of the changes, while all other MPs voted that the Government should bring in transitional arrangements to allow those already in the UK before the rule change to qualify under the previous four-year rule. These changes were protested in demonstrations and rallies in London on 16 June and 23 July 2006.

The changes were retroactive in the sense that people on a four-year visas must apply for a one-year extension before they can apply for ILR, but they did not affect people who had already been granted ILR after four years.

===HC 398===

As from 2 April 2007, a new condition has been added that &quot;the applicant has sufficient knowledge of the English language and sufficient knowledge about life in the United Kingdom, unless he is under the age of 18 or aged 65 or over at the time he makes his application.&quot;

There are two ways the applicant can meet this condition:
* by passing a test called the &quot;Life in the UK Test&quot;. The test is taken on a computer at one of the 100 or so Life in the UK Test centres in the UK. It consists of 24 questions based on the information contained in the handbook &quot;Life in the United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship&quot; (2nd Edition) and requires a language ability the equivalent of ESOL Entry 3.
* by attending an English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) course which includes citizenship materials, and progressing from one ESOL level to the next. It is stated that on average students require between 200 and 450 hours of tuition for each ESOL level.

===HC 194===

On 9 July 2012, the 14-year rule (paragraph 276B(i)(b)) (which provided a route to settlement on the grounds of long residence, lawful or unlawful) was withdrawn. Instead, the new Immigration Rules provided that at least 20 years&#x27; continuous residence, lawful or unlawful, would, subject to criminality and other criteria, normally be necessary to establish a claim to remain in the UK on the basis of the Article 8 right to respect for private life. (The 10-year rule (paragraph 276B(i)(a)), which provides a route to settlement on the grounds of continuous lawful residence in the UK of at least 10 years, was unaffected and remains in place).

ILR may also be curtailed by the Home Secretary for reasons of national security or if the holder of the ILR commits an offence that could lead to their deportation from the United Kingdom.

A person may also lose ILR by leaving the United Kingdom for more than two years. However, in some circumstances, such a person may reapply for indefinite leave to enter the UK.

British Overseas citizens, British subjects and British protected persons do not lose ILR no matter how long they stay outside the UK.

<text>John Broome (May 4, 1913 – March 14, 1999), who additionally used the pseudonyms John Osgood and Edgar Ray Meritt, was an American comic book writer for DC Comics. Along with Gil Kane, he co-created the supervillain Sinestro.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Broome was born Irving Broome to a Jewish family. As a youth, he enjoyed reading science fiction and began writing for science-fiction pulp magazines in the 1940s. By then he was already writing for some of the earliest American comic books to be published, beginning with a two-page &quot;Pals and Pastimes&quot; humor strip, illustrated by Ray Gill, in Centaur Publications&#x27; &quot;Funny Pages&quot; #7 (Dec. 1936). By 1942 he was writing text fillers for Fawcett Comics, at least one under the pseudonym Ron Broom. When his agent, Julius Schwartz, became an editor at what would become DC Comics during the 1930–40s &quot;Golden Age of Comic Books&quot;, Broome was recruited to write superhero stories starring the Flash, Green Lantern, Sargon the Sorcerer and others. His first known script for the company was the 13-page Flash story &quot;The City of Shifting Sand&quot; in &quot;All-Flash&quot; #22 (May 1946). He wrote text fillers under the pen name John Osgood.

Through the 1940s, Broome wrote primarily Green Lantern stories and the superhero team the Justice Society of America, and contributed an occasional tale starring the Atom, the Hawkman, or Doctor Mid-Nite, in titles including &quot;Sensation Comics&quot;, &quot;Comic Cavalcade&quot;, &quot;All Star Comics&quot;, &quot;All-American Comics&quot;, and &quot;Flash Comics&quot;. Broome and artist Irwin Hasen created the supervillain Per Degaton as a JSA antagonist in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #35 (July 1947). His final Golden Age Green Lantern story appeared in the last issue of that character&#x27;s title, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #38 (May 1949), and his final JSA story in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #57 (March 1951), the last before its retitling as &quot;All-Star Western&quot;.

===1950s and the Silver Age===
As the new decade began, Broome wrote science-fiction stories for DC, both standalone tales—including &quot;The Mind Robbers&quot;, in &quot;Mystery in Space&quot; #1 (May 1951), under the pseudonym Robert Stark—and continuing-character features, such as &quot;Astra&quot; (in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot;, one story of which teamed him with his future regular artist collaborator, Gil Kane), and &quot;Captain Comet&quot;, which he created with penciler Carmine Infantino in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #9 (June 1951). For the latter he used the pen name Edgar Ray Merritt, devised by his friend and editor Julius Schwartz, as a nod to fantasy writers Poe, Bradbury, and Abraham. Outside that genre, he wrote a large number of stories for the crime comics anthology &quot;Big Town&quot;, based on the radio and television shows.

During this time, Broome created many DC characters and institutions, including the whimsical simian sleuth Detective Chimp, with artist Infantino, in &quot;The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog&quot; #4 (Aug. 1952); the Phantom Stranger, also with Infantino, in &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; #1 (Sept. 1952); and the post-apocalyptic heroes the Atomic Knights, with artist Murphy Anderson, in &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; #117 (June 1960).

With the dawn of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books, Broome was instrumental in writing stories of two key characters who helped revive the moribund archetype of the superhero. Following the creation of an all new Flash, a.k.a. Barry Allen, who carried the superhero name from the original Golden Age Flash, by scripter Robert Kanigher and penciler Infantino in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (Oct 1956)—considered the comic that triggered the Silver Age—Broome wrote Flash stories beginning in that very issue. He wrote numerous Flash stories in the character&#x27;s subsequent series. He co-created several of the character&#x27;s primary supervillain antagonists including Captain Boomerang in issue #117 (Dec. 1960), the 64th century villain Abra Kadabra in #128 (May 1962), and Professor Zoom in #139 (Sept. 1963). Captain Boomerang was featured in the 2016 &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; film and was portrayed by actor Jai Courtney. Other Broome additions to the Flash mythos, Kid Flash and the Elongated Man were respectively introduced in issues #110 and 112 as allies of the speedster.

Broome, with penciler Kane and editor-conceptualist Schwartz, created Hal Jordan, the Silver Age Green Lantern, in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (Oct. 1959). He became the character&#x27;s primary scripter in Green Lantern&#x27;s solo series as well. Broome&#x27;s stories for the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; series included transforming Hal Jordan&#x27;s love interest, Carol Ferris, into the Star Sapphire in issue #16. Black Hand, a character featured prominently in the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline in 2009–2010, debuted in issue #29 (June 1964) by Broome and Kane. The creative team created Guy Gardner in the story &quot;Earth&#x27;s Other Green Lantern!&quot; in issue #59 (March 1968). Writer-editor Dennis Mallonee described Broome&#x27;s work on &quot;Green Lantern&quot; as the only superhero series in which screwball comedy &quot;was essentially realized&quot;, and called Broome &quot;a genius. He wrote about Hal Jordan, not Green Lantern. Hal&#x27;s total frustration with Carol&#x27;s completely goofy &#x27;independence&#x27; was the reason I got a kick out of the early silver age Green Lantern.&quot; Comics historian Brian Cronin examined similar themes in Broome&#x27;s work in a 2011 column.

In 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles and together with Broome and Infantino jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the franchise such as Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite and gave the character a &quot;New Look&quot; that premiered in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #327 (May 1964).

===Later life===
In the late 1960s, Broome and his wife, Peggy, moved to Paris, France, where he continued to script for DC Comics. His last Batman story, &quot;Public Luna-Tic Number One!&quot;, was published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #388 (June 1969). His final Flash story, &quot;The Bride Cast Two Shadows&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #194 (Feb. 1970), and his final Green Lantern, &quot;The Golden Obelisk of Qward&quot;, in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #75 (March 1970).

Broome then retired from comic-book scripting to travel and, eventually, teach English in Japan. He returned to the United States in 1998, attending his first comic-book convention, Comic-Con International.

Broome died March 14, 1999, at age 85, in Chiang Mai, Thailand, while swimming in a hotel pool while vacationing with his wife. His last address of record was the U.S. Embassy, Tokyo, Japan, with his death certificate issued in New York State.

==Awards==
Broome received a 1964 Alley Award for &quot;Best Short Story&quot;: &quot;Doorway to the Unknown!&quot; in &quot;The Flash&quot; #148 (Nov. 1964), with artist Carmine Infantino. He received an Inkpot Award in 1998 and posthumously received the Bill Finger Award for Excellence in Comic Book Writing in 2009.

==Homages==
An homage to Broome and artist Gil Kane appears in the novel &quot;In Darkest Night&quot;, which is set in the universe of the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series. In the novel, a place in Coast City is named the &quot;Kane/Broome Institute for Space Studies&quot;. In the direct-to-DVD film &quot;Emerald Knights&quot; the Broome Kane Galaxy is likewise named for him and Gil Kane. In the 2011 &quot;Green Lantern&quot; movie, Broome&#x27;s Bar is named after him. In the &quot;Green Lantern: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Steam Lantern,&quot; the eponymous character&#x27;s real name is Gil Broome, Esq.
In &quot;The Flash&quot; episode &quot;The New Rogues&quot;, the industrial complex in which the Mirror Master and the Top gain their powers is Broome Industries. A character named Nathan Broome was created Jeremy Adams and Alejandro Germanico Benito Gonzalez also known as Xermanico in the Dawn of DC Green Lantern. He was Carol Farris&#x27;s new boyfriend and fiancé, but she still had feelings for Hal and before they could vow at a superhero theme chapel in Las Vagas, 
She realized Hal was in need of help when her Star Sapphire ring appears in front of her, and she left Nathan brokenhearted at the altar and the emotional spectrum of sadness found Nathan and he became villain known as the Sorrow Lantern and he vowed that everyone would feel his pain and sadness. Close proximity to Sorrow Lantern causes people to feel sad and lose all hope.

<doc id="668843" wikidata="Q13489497" url="?curid=668843" title="Shibaura">
<text>is a district of Minato ward located in Tokyo, Japan. The district is located between the eastern side of the Yamanote Line train and Tokyo Bay. Shibaura consists mostly of artificial islands created by the excavation of industrial canals in the early 20th century. Formerly a light industrial area, it became famous for its night life during the Japanese asset price bubble period and, since the early 2000s, has become a high-rise residential district.

==Economy==
Shibaura is the home to a number of major Japanese corporations including:
*Toshiba (originally Tokyo Shibaura Electric)
*SUMCO
*Cosmo Oil Company
*Mitsubishi Motors
*THK
* FamilyMart
* Yanase
* Bandai Namco Amusement

==Rail links==
The district is served by Tamachi Station on the Yamanote and Keihin-Tōhoku Lines, and by Shibaura-futō Station of the Yurikamome line. The Yokosuka Line also runs in a tunnel below the district, although there are no stops in the area.

==Road links==
The Tokyo Expressway system passes through the area, and the central Tokyo side of Route 11 connecting to the Rainbow Bridge terminates at Shibaura Junction.

==Education==

Minato City Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools.

Shibaura 1 chōme 6-16 ban, Shibaura 2-3 chōme, and 4-chōme 20-22-ban are zoned to Shibahama Elementary School (芝浜小学校). Shibaura 4-chōme 1-19-ban are zoned to Shibaura Elementary School (芝浦小学校).

<text>Gaspar Noé (; ; born 27 December 1963) is an Argentine filmmaker, who lives and worked primarily in France. He is one of the primary exponents of New French Extremity, with his most notable works including the feature films &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; (1998), &quot;Irréversible&quot; (2002), &quot;Enter the Void&quot; (2009), &quot;Love&quot; (2015), &quot;Climax&quot; (2018), &quot;Lux Æterna&quot; (2019), and &quot;Vortex&quot; (2021). Noé&#x27;s father is artist and writer Luis Felipe Noé.

==Early life and education==
Noé was born on 27 December 1963 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His father Luis Felipe Noé, is a notable Argentine artist, writer, and intellectual. His father is of Italian descent, while his mother Nora Murphy is of Irish descent. He has a sister named Paula. He lived in New York City until age five, after which point his family returned to Argentina. In 1976, they emigrated to France to escape the military dictatorship occurring in Argentina at the time. 

Noé graduated from École nationale supérieure Louis-Lumière in France in 1982. His first feature filmmaking credits were as an assistant director to Argentine filmmaker Fernando Solanas on &quot;Tangos, the Exile of Gardel&quot; (1986) and &quot;Sur&quot; (1988).

==Artistry==
His work has been strongly associated with a collection of films often described as new extreme films. Highlighting their challenging sexual and violent bodily imagery, Tim Palmer has described them as part of a &quot;cinéma du corps&quot; (cinema of the body), and a cinema of &#x27;brutal intimacy&#x27; because of its attenuated use of narrative, generally assaulting and often illegible cinematography, confrontational subject material, a treatment of sexual behavior as violent rather than mutually intimate, and a pervasive sense of social nihilism or despair.

Noé often directly addresses the audience in confrontational ways, most notably in &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, when an intertitle warns the audience that they have 30 seconds to leave the cinema before the final violent climax. In a different way, this can be seen in &quot;Irreversible&quot;, in which the 10-minute long single-take rape sequence has frequently been read as an assault on viewers, as well as a depiction of an assault on the female character.

=== Collaborations ===
Gaspar Noé and Lucile Hadžihalilović have repeatedly collaborated with each other on film projects. In the early 1990s, Noé co-founded the production company &quot;Les Cinémas de la Zone&quot; with Hadžihalilović. Noé operated the camera and was the cinematographer for two short films directed by Hadžihalilović: &quot;La Bouche de Jean-Pierre&quot; (1996) and &quot;Good Boys Use Condoms&quot; (1998). Similarly, Hadžihalilović produced and edited &quot;Carne&quot; (1991), edited &quot;Seul contre tous&quot; (1998) and was credited as a writer on &quot;Enter the Void&quot; (2009). The creative collaboration is made clear in the comparable stylistic choices across these early films, most clearly the credit sequences and the marketing designs. In 2025, Noé will appear in Hadžihalilović&#x27;s fourth feature film, &quot;The Ice Tower&quot;.

Three of his films feature the character of a nameless butcher played by Philippe Nahon: &quot;Carne&quot;, &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; and, in a cameo, &quot;Irréversible&quot;.

All of Noé&#x27;s feature films are shot by cinematographer Benoît Debie. 

The music for &quot;Irréversible&quot; was composed by Thomas Bangalter. The latter also sent Gaspar Noé an unreleased song he made circa 1995 for &quot;Climax.&quot; The song was named &quot;Sangria&quot; in reference to the movie.

In collaboration with Saint Laurent, he directed films &quot;Lux Æterna&quot; and &quot;Saint Laurent - Summer of ‘21.&quot;

=== Style and influences ===
Noé stated in the September 2012 edition of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine that seeing &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; at the age of seven changed his life, without which experience he would never have become a director. A poster for the film features notably in a scene towards the end of &quot;Irreversible&quot;.

Many of his movies feature all kind of film posters, which reflects his collection and passion for them. He&#x27;s believed to be the owner of one of the three known copies of the rarest poster for &quot;M&quot; (1931 film). Since &quot;Irréversible&quot;, he&#x27;s kept working with French film poster designer Laurent Lufroy for all his feature films: Lufroy even appears in &quot;Love&quot; (as a policeman), &quot;Climax&quot; (as a dog-handler) and &quot;Lux Æterna&quot; (using a torch).

Noé also cites the 1983 Austrian serial killer film, &quot;Angst&quot;, by Gerald Kargl, as a major influence. 

In 2024, during an interview from his masterclass session in Cairo International Film Festival in Egypt, he said that he want to do a different film, &quot;a film with kids, for children&quot;.

==Personal life==
He is the business partner of filmmaker Lucile Hadžihalilović. 

Noé is a dual national of Argentina and Italy, having obtained an Italian passport through lineage, though he does not consider himself Italian. &quot;I have never lived in Italy, I don&#x27;t speak Italian,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;If I hadn&#x27;t had an Italian passport to travel all over the world, I would have applied for a French one.&quot;

Noé suffered a near fatal brain hemorrhage in early 2020, which partly inspired the plot of his film &quot;Vortex&quot;.

== Photography ==
Besides being a filmmaker, he is an occasional photographer. In 2013, Noé shot the cover art for American singer-songwriter Sky Ferreira&#x27;s debut album &quot;Night Time, My Time&quot;. Other celebrities, such as Agnès b., Todd Solondz or Stacy Martin were shot by Gaspar Noé, as well as several models for erotic magazines.

== Reception ==
Many of Noé&#x27;s films were polarizing or controversial with viewers due to their inclusion of graphic scenes of violence and sexual violence. &quot;I Stand Alone, Irreversible, Enter the Void&quot;, &quot;We Fuck Alone,&quot; &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;Climax&quot; were all considered controversial for their challenging sexual and violent imagery.

=== &quot;Irreversible&quot; ===
&quot;Irreversible&quot; was hugely divisive amongst critics with journals such as &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; (UK) and &quot;Positif&quot; (France) allowing critics to openly voice their disagreements about the film. It caused substantial outrage in many countries for its central scene of rape, filmed in a single take and lasting nearly ten minutes in total, with some critics comparing it to pornography because of its length and the use of a static camera, as well as considering the film as a whole to be deeply homophobic for its hellish portrayal of a gay S&amp;M club. On the other hand, it was also frequently praised for its brutal portrayal of the horrors of rape, and its implicit challenge to viewers of the scene. Eugenie Brinkema, for instance, describes &quot;Irreversible&quot; as &quot;ethically, generically, subjectively&quot; disruptive: &quot;the rape [...] is real, it is private, it is contained – it is insufferably present. [...] it interrogates vehicles of receptivity and the power and violence done to bodies by bodies&quot;.

<text>A German Requiem is a 1991 historical detective novel and the last in the Berlin Noir trilogy of Bernhard Gunther novels written by Philip Kerr.

==Plot==
After spending the latter part of World War II in a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp, 1947 sees Bernhard Gunther now married to a wife who is trading sex with U.S. Army officers for scarce goods. Berlin and Vienna were captured by the Red Army, so Germans, former Nazis, Allied occupiers, and Gunther have the Russians to contend with. An old colleague from Gunther&#x27;s days in Berlin, a dirty cop, war criminal, and smuggler named Emil Becker, has been accused and jailed in Vienna for the killing of an American officer called Linden. A high-ranking MVD officer named Poroshin, who claims to be a friend of Becker, tries to recruit Gunther to investigate the case and get Becker exonerated in exchange for a large fee. According to Poroshin, after acting as a secret Vienna-Berlin courier for a certain König, Becker was framed for the murder of Linden, who Becker had met through König.

Gunther takes a train to Vienna and visits Becker in jail, where he learns that Becker&#x27;s henchmen had been killed trying to find König and his girlfriend Lotte Hartmann at Becker&#x27;s request. Gunther starts his investigation in Vienna, by attending Linden&#x27;s funeral, where he is accosted by Roy Shields, an American MP. At approximately the same time, Gunther rescues a recent acquaintance, Veronika, a local prostitute he met as part of the investigation, from rape by two Russian soldiers. As part of the intervention, Gunther gets knocked down and is himself rescued in extremis by John Belinsky, a man bearing identification associating him with the American Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) that had been covertly tailing him. They fraternize, Belinsky admits to also being investigating the murder of Linden, and they agree to collaborate.

When Gunther discovers the whereabouts of Lotte Hartman, he teams up with Belinsky to organize a scheme in which Gunther and Lotte would be somehow about be arrested and jailed by the Russians, so that Gunther could ingratiate himself with her by obtaining her freedom. The scheme works and Gunther is eventually approached by König, who wants to repay him from springing Lotte. After they meet, König is impressed by Gunther&#x27;s past credentials and eventually, recruits him in a secret organization of former Nazis called the &quot;Org&quot;, which Gunther accepts to infiltrate with the knowledge of Belinsky. Gunther soon finds out that Becker was also in the Org, for which he was acting as a double agent for his friend Poroshin.

One night, Veronika finds Gunther to ask for his help getting rid of the body of a &quot;client&quot;, Heim, who died of a heart attack in her bed. Gunther, with the help of Belinsky, oblige and as part of the operation discover that Heim was a dentist specializing in teeth extractions, visibly for the purpose of making Nazis escape identification through dental records. At that point Belinsky reveals that he is actually looking for Heinrich Müller, the former head of the Gestapo, who faked his death and is suspected of having killed Linden. Belinsky asks Gunther to find Müller, which would allow him to free Becker. As Gunther&#x27;s infiltration of the Org progresses, he eventually gets to meet Arthur Nebe, who was also presumed dead. It now becomes clear that the members of the Org had all received new identities to hide their Nazi past, which involved the removal of their teeth. To catch Müller, Gunther and Belinsky organize a sting operation at the vineyard estate of Nebe in Grinzing on the occasion of a formal meeting of the Org.

Gunther shows up to the meeting early to look for Veronika, who had disappeared in the meantime, but gets intercepted by a murderous Latvian guard before being rescued by Nebe. He nevertheless gets to meet with Müller, who ends up believing his cover. As he moves around the house to signal from a window for Belinsky to storm the property, Gunther discovers that Veronika is being tortured in the cellar by König. He frees her but is taken down by the Latvian again. His cover blown, Gunther gets interrogated by Müller under threat that they will crush Veronika in a wine press. Gunther admits everything he knows but Veronika gets crushed anyway. Later, Nebe visits Gunther in his cell and tells him the complete story of Linden so he can feed it back to Müller to avoid further torture. During their conversation Nebe eats a cake poisoned by Gunther and dies, allowing Gunther to escape the property in a car which he later crashes during the ensuing pursuit. The novel ends as Gunther recovers and learns from Shield that Becker had been hanged and Belinsky was not actually a CIC officer, but an agent of Poroshin.

<text>Waterford Crystal is an Irish manufacturer of crystal glassware, especially cut glass products. It is named after the city of Waterford in Ireland. In January 2009, the main Waterford Crystal manufacturing base on the edge of Waterford was closed due to the insolvency of Waterford Wedgwood plc, and in June 2010, Waterford Crystal relocated almost back to the roots of glass-making in the city centre. The Mall location holds both a manufacturing facility that melts over 750 tonnes of crystal a year – although most Waterford Crystal is now produced outside Ireland – and a visitor centre with the world&#x27;s largest collection of Waterford Crystal. Since 2015, the brand has been owned by Fiskars Corporation.

==History==
===Waterford Glassworks===
The origins of crystal production in Waterford date back to 1783, when George Penrose and his nephew William Penrose started their business, the Waterford Glassworks. It produced extremely fine flint glass that became world-renowned. That firm closed in June 1851, with the loss of 53 to 100 jobs.

===Revival attempts===
The Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, led by Sir Horace Plunkett, had sponsored John St John Lyburn&#x27;s experiments at replicating the Waterford Glassworks style of glass at a small glassworks built at the Greater Cork International Exhibition of 1903. Lyburn was later sent to discuss a 1912 proposal by the principal of Waterford&#x27;s Central Technical Institute to provide instruction in glassmaking, which was followed by a 1913 proposal for commercial production within the school. The expert input was that it was not yet time for Waterford people to resume glassmaking, but there was discussion with an American investor seeking a glass factory location in Ireland. The Bishop of Waterford and Lismore, Richard Sheehan, was opposed to foreign investment due to the risk of &quot;foreign influences&quot;, and the investor was not persuaded to set up in Waterford.

In 1933, a Belgian company explored opening a finishing plant in Waterford, and this was discussed with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass, who was keen to secure a glass factory for Waterford. The Belgian project did not proceed but in 1935 a Dublin jeweller, Bernard J. Fitzpatrick, approached a senior official in the Department of Industry and Commerce about an Irish glass-making concept, and in 1937 a local group proposed a project to involve the German company of Otto Maetz of Düsseldorf. This latter was studied by Lemass, still Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the Irish representative in Berlin, Charles Bewley, but was not realised. Meantime, in 1938 Fitzpatrick approached a Czech friend and supplier, Karel (Charles) Bacik, who had four glass factories, about setting up in Waterford. Bacik expressed interest but could not move to Ireland due to have commitments to a young family, and further discussions were delayed by World War II. 

===Foundation of 1947===
Bernard Fitzpatrick visited Charles Bacik shortly after World War II ended, in January 1946, and secured special permits to visit again in May. This time Bacik, his family home taken over by the USSR Armed Forces and his factories nationalised, accepted Fitzpatrick&#x27;s proposal to restart glassmaking in Waterford, and they agreed on the organisation of the factory, with Bacik to secure key staff, and Fitzpatrick a site and permissions. Fitzpatrick agreed a location at Ballytruckle, by Waterford&#x27;s greyhound track and a soccer ground, with the City Manager and shared the plans with the Department of Industry and Commerce. On arrival, he also accommodated the Baciks, with beds provided by Denis Guiney of Clerys department store. Bacik visited Waterford in August 1946, and he sought permission for the factory in October.

After also exploring Carlow as a possible location, Bacik formally applied for a lease on the Ballytruckle lands in January 1947, and it was granted for 75 years. Finance was secured from various sources, including a government loan, and construction began on 3 April 1947. Skilled crystal workers were not available in Ireland, so continental Europeans were engaged, starting in June 1947 with Bacik&#x27;s fellow countryman and former intern, the designer Miroslav Havel. A glass-cutting machine began operation for apprentice work in August 1947, but progress was limited by an explosion, and initial production was only of &quot;soda glass&quot;. First glass blowing was on 11 September 1947, and first official cutting on 21 September.

By the early 1950s, it had been taken over as a subsidiary of the Irish Glass Bottle company, owned by Joseph McGrath, Richard Duggan and Spencer Freeman of the Irish Hospitals&#x27; Sweepstake, heavy investors in Irish business at that time.

In 1970, John Aynsley and Sons was taken over by Waterford and renamed Aynsley China Ltd. At peak operations, Waterford employed 3,000 staff in a city of 46,000.

===1990s onward===
Jasper Conran began designing his signature range of crystal for Waterford in 1999. The endeavour evolved into four unique lines for Waterford, and a complementary tableware collection in fine bone china for Wedgwood in 2001. The Hong Kong-born Irish fashion designer John Rocha started designing a range of cut crystal stemware and vases in collaboration with glass designer Marcus Notley in 2001.

===Consolidation===
Due to rising competition, Waterford Wedgwood announced the closure of its second Irish factory, in Dungarvan, in May 2005, in order to consolidate all operations into the main factory in Kilbarry, Waterford City, where 1,000 people were employed by the company. The move resulted in nearly 500 Dungarvan workers losing their jobs. In this period, some production (20% by 2007) was outsourced to factories in the Czech Republic and Poland, and later also to Slovenia.

Waterford Crystal Limited was, until March 2009, a subsidiary of Waterford Wedgwood plc, itself formed through the acquisition by the then Waterford Glass Group of the famous pottery manufacturer Josiah Wedgwood in 1986. The last chairman was Tony O&#x27;Reilly, and the CEO was John Foley. The leading shareholders of the holding company were former billionaire O&#x27;Reilly and his family, joined in the last decade by O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s brother-in-law, Greek shipping heir Peter Goulandris.

===2009 receivership===
Waterford Wedgwood was forced into receivership in early 2009 during the Great Recession. On 5 January 2009, news of the receivership of Waterford Wedgwood plc was announced in Ireland and the UK.

On 30 January 2009, it was announced that the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry was to shut down immediately, despite earlier promises to discuss any such move with the unions in advance. The Kilbarry operation featured a tourist centre offering guided tours of the factory, a gift shop, café, and gallery. Many of the employees performed an unofficial sit-in. The sit-in made the BBC News, hoping to prevail upon receiver Deloitte to retain those jobs. On 4 February 2009, there were protests across the city at how the workers were being treated. On 27 February 2009, the receiver, David Carson of Deloitte, confirmed that US equity firm KPS Capital Partners was to purchase certain overseas assets and businesses of the Waterford Wedgwood Group. The sit-in ended in March 2009 after workers agreed to split a payment of €10m. The fight by the workers to keep the factory open is chronicled in a PBS online documentary.

Under the receivership managed by Deloitte, ownership of most of Waterford Wedgwood plc&#x27;s assets was transferred to KPS Capital Partners in March 2009. Waterford Crystal, along with Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, and other brands, were transferred to a new company named WWRD Holdings Limited (WWRD). The sale did not include the factory or visitor centre in Kilbary, and the visitor centre shut its doors on 22 January 2010. A new visitor and manufacturing facility opened in June 2010.

===Acquisition by Fiskars===

On 11 May 2015, in a deal that closed in July 2015, Fiskars Corporation, a Finnish maker of home products, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD. On 2 July 2015, the acquisition of WWRD by Fiskars Corporation was completed, including the brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Rogaška. The acquisition was approved by the US antitrust authorities.

==Products==

Most Waterford crystal is now produced outside Ireland in countries such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany. Waterford produces many patterns of lead and non-lead crystal stemware, including lines such as &quot;Adare, Alana, Colleen, Kincora, Lismore, Maeve, Tramore&quot;, and many others.

In 1966, Waterford&#x27;s chandeliers were installed in Westminster Abbey for the 900th anniversary of the dedication of the abbey after Christoper Hildyard, a minor canon of the abbey for 45 years, convinced the Guinness family to pay for them. Chandeliers hang in other notable buildings, such as Windsor Castle, and the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C. Waterford Crystal made the 2,688 crystals for the famous New Year&#x27;s Eve Ball that is dropped each year in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. The ball is an geodesic orb, in diameter and is lit by 32,256 Lumileds Luxeon Rebel LEDs.

One of the most popular products in their collection is the &quot;Apprentice Bowl&quot;. It requires 600 precision cuts, all done by hand. Cutters would set out to complete this bowl in their fifth and final year of apprenticeship. They were only permitted three attempts, where the cutter would then be graded and if they passed it would receive the Waterford Crystal watermark.

Sporting trophies are also crafted by Waterford, such as the Masters Series crystal shield trophies that are awarded to the winner of each of the nine men&#x27;s professional tennis Masters Series tournaments, the AFCA National Championship Trophy that is awarded to the US college football team which finishes the season at the top of the Coaches Poll, and a representation of the Ashes urn that is presented to the winners of the Test cricket series between England and Australia. The trophy for the Masters snooker championship is also made by Waterford Crystal, as is the Scottish Open snooker championship trophy.

Also crafted by Waterford are the winning trophies for the French, Belgian and German Grand Prix in Formula One, a bat and ball trophy presented at the final game at Yankee Stadium to Derek Jeter and a glass tennis racket for Boris Becker. They also design the trophies for the People&#x27;s Choice Awards.

<text>The Ulch people, also known as Olcha, Olchi or Ulchi, (, obsolete ольчи; Ulch: , nani) are an Indigenous people of the Russian Far East, who speak a Tungusic language known as Ulch. Over 90% of Ulchis live in Ulchsky District of Khabarovsk Krai, Russia. According to the 2002 census, there were 2,913 Ulchs living in Russia—down from 3,173 recorded in the 1989 census, but up from 2,494 recorded in the 1979 census, and 2,410 recorded in the 1970 census. According to the 2010 census there were 2,765 Ulchs in Russia.

== History ==

The Ulch people descend from the autochthonous Paleolithic population of coastal Northeast Asia and were found to be very similar to ancient samples found in this region from about 8000 years ago.

The Ulch people are often classified as one of the ancient Paleosiberian peoples, which is however not an ethno-linguistic group but a term applied to various ethnic groups of Siberia which do not belong to the bigger Northeast Asian populations (such as Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic populations). Others classify them as one of the Tungusic peoples as their language belongs to the Tungusic languages.

=== Lifestyle ===
The first mention of the Ulchi is from the Russians and dates back to the 17th century.

The Ulchi led a sedentary lifestyle in small villages of two to five houses. The villages had both winter and summer dwellings. The ancient winter dwelling, the &quot;hagdu&quot;, was a ground frame structure made of pillars and logs with a gable roof without a ceiling, and an earthen or clay floor. The house was heated by two kanovye hearths. In extreme cold, the Ulch also used large metal braziers on three legs with burning coals. A characteristic feature of the Ulch winter dwelling is the presence of a &quot;dog table&quot;, or uycheu - a low platform on which sled dogs were fed. Summer dwellings were of two types - quadrangular made of poles with gable roofs, covered with bark (daura) and pile letniki (gengga). While fishing, the Ulchi built small cylindrical huts.

Fishing is the main branch of their traditional economic complex. Their most important food source was the anadromous salmon. The needs of their catch largely determined the settlement pattern of the Ulchi - along the right bank of the main channel of the Amur, on the main routes of the salmon returning to their spawning grounds. The traditional fishing equipment consisted of gear nets, rides, hook tackle, different types of stocks and the like. Each of them was used, depending on the season, weather conditions, water level in the river, fishing objects, and many other characteristics. Fish were caught both for daily consumption and for storage. The main method of preserving the catch was to make yukola - fish dried in the wind and sun in the form of thin long plates.

Hunting was of secondary importance, mostly fur animals, since furs were in great demand among traders. They mostly hunted Siberian rabbit, squirrel, otter, fox, and most importantly, sable.

At the end of the 19th century, sable was already rare on the Amur, so they went on long expeditions to Sakhalin, to the basins of the Amgun, Gorin and , on the coast of the Tatar Strait and on Hokkaido. Ungulates (elk, deer) were hunted all year round using crossbows. Hunting for sea animals also played a significant role in their economic life, and they caught seals and sea lions.

=== Clothing ===
The upper summer clothing for men and women was kimono-cut cloth capchum robes with a left hem that was fastened on the right side. Ornaments on men&#x27;s clothing were rare. Winter clothing was insulated (quilted on cotton wool). In winter, fur coats were also worn, cut like a robe and covered on top with cotton or silk fabric. Winter hats looked like a hood with a top made of white dog kamuses and a fox trim around the face. In severe frosts, a devil&#x27;s fur earmuffs were worn under such a hat. In the summer they used birch bark hats. Shoes were made of fish, deer and elk leather (rovduga), seal and sea lion leather.

The term &quot;shaved-head people&quot; was used to describe the Nanai people by Ulch people.

=== Genetics ===
According to Sukernik &quot;et al.&quot; (2012), the mitochondrial DNA of the present-day Ulchi population belongs predominantly to haplogroup Y1a (69/160 = 43.1%), which is shared with Nivkhs, Koryaks, Evens, and Mongolians and is estimated to have a time to most recent common ancestor of approximately 6,000 (95% CI 3,300 &lt;-&gt; 8,800) years before present on the basis of complete genomes or approximately 1,800 (95% CI 800 &lt;-&gt; 2,900) years before present on the basis of synonymous positions. Another 20% of the present-day Ulchi population belongs to mitochondrial DNA haplogroup D, which is significantly more diverse than their haplogroup Y1a mtDNA and can be resolved as follows: 12/160 = 7.5% D4o2, 4/160 = 2.5% D4h, 3/160 = 1.9% D4e4, 3/160 = 1.9% D4j, 2/160 = 1.25% D3, 2/160 = 1.25% D4c2, 1/160 = 0.6% D4a1, 1/160 = 0.6% D4b2b, 1/160 = 0.6% D4g2b, 1/160 = 0.6% D4m2, 1/160 = 0.6% D4o1, 1/160 = 0.6% D5a. Haplogroups C (20/160 = 12.5%, including 11/160 = 6.9% C5, 5/160 = 3.1% C4b, 3/160 = 1.9% C4a1, 1/160 = 0.6% C1a) and G (14/160 = 8.75%, including 12/160 = 7.5% G1b and 2/160 = 1.25% G2a1) are also well represented. The remainder of the Ulchi mitochondrial DNA pool consists of haplogroups N9b (7/160 = 4.4%), M8a (6/160 = 3.75%), F1a (5/160 = 3.1%), M7 (4/160 = 2.5%), M9a1 (1/160 = 0.6%), Z1 (1/160 = 0.6%), and B5b2 (1/160 = 0.6%).

According to a study by Balanovska &quot;et al.&quot; (2018), present-day Ulchi males belong to Y-DNA haplogroups C-M217(xM48, M407) (18/52 = 34.6%), C-M48 (18/52 = 34.6%, including 9/52 = 17.3% C-M86/F12355(xB470, F13686), 4/52 = 7.7% C-F13686, 1/52 = 1.9% C-B470, and 4/52 = 7.7% C-B93(xGG_16645386), the last of which is a deeply divergent branch belonging to C-M48(xM86)), O-M175 (8/52 = 15.4%, including 6/52 = 11.5% O-M122(xP201), 1/52 = 1.9% O-M119, and 1/52 = 1.9% O-P31), Q-M242(xM120) (3/52 = 5.8%), N-M231 (3/52 = 5.8%, including 1/52 = 1.9% N-M231(xM128, P43, M178), 1/52 = 1.9% N-M2118, and 1/52 = 1.9% N-B479), I-P37 (1/52 = 1.9%), and J–M267(xP58) (1/52 = 1.9%).

The population genetics of the Ulchi are linked to 7,700 year old remains from Chertovy Vorota Cave (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Gate&quot;) and are also genetically similar to an East Asian genetic component within Native Americans. The Ulchi do not appear to have originally possessed the &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; (ANE) genetic component found in low frequency in Native Americans and Central Asian, as well as in higher percentage in South Asian, and West Eurasian (European and Middle Eastern) populations; and thus are suggested to represent the East Asian component of Native Americans. But there is evidence of gene flow from Central Asian and Far East populations over the past 1000 to 3000 years. 6.0% of modern Ulchi also share an ancestral component unique to a 2500-year-old Jōmon individual.

== Language ==

The Ulch language belongs to the southern (Amur) branch of the Tungusic languages. Along with the languages of the Nanai people and the Oroks, it contains relics of the ancient pre-Tungusic &quot;Amuric&quot; vocabulary, which makes it possible to consider the ancestors of the Ulchi as one of the most ancient inhabitants of the Amur region.

== Religion ==
The traditional religion of the Ulchi, as well as of other peoples of the Amur region, is expressed by animism and shamanism. A large role in the social life of the Ulchi is their system of cults of family and ancestors (ancestor worship). Their religion bears similarities to the religion of the Nivkh people and Ainu people.

<text>Shannon Wright is an American singer-songwriter. She was born in Jacksonville, Florida, United States, where she spent her childhood.

Former member of the band Crowsdell, Shannon Wright moved from New York to Chapel Hill, North Carolina in 1998, and while in Chapel Hill, Wright started writing songs and playing them for friends. With their encouragement she sent a 4-track cassette tape to a friend of a friend who started Overcoat Records. They released her first 7&quot; &quot;A Tin Crown for the Social Bash&quot;. Later that year, Wright signed with Touch and Go Records in 1999 from Chicago, releasing six albums. Wright signed with Vicious Circle (France) in 2003 and continues to release records with them. In 2012, Wright signed with Ernest Jennings and released &quot;Secret Blood&quot; and &quot;In Film Sound&quot; in the States.

==Recording career==
&quot;FlightSafety&quot; Wright&#x27;s first record received critical acclaim for her lyrics and songwriting abilities. &quot;FlightSafety&quot; consists of simple guitar and piano chord progressions with vocal melodies. Wright plays almost all the instruments on this release and all other releases following FlightSafety.

&quot;Maps of Tacit&quot; Recorded with Andy Baker and Steve Albini. &quot;Overall, &quot;Maps of Tacit&quot; finds Wright growing more adventurous both as a composer and performer; it&#x27;s a dark and challenging work, yet it isn&#x27;t off-putting or overly harrowing, and its bracing experimentalism and originality suggest even greater things to come.&quot; – &quot;AllMusic&quot; review by Steve Huey.

&quot;Perishable Goods&quot; was a limited mini-album compiled of appearances by: Alan Sparhawk of Low, Crooked Fingers, and Rachel Grimes and Christian Fredrickson from Rachel&#x27;s.

&quot;Dyed in the Wool&quot;, recorded with Andy Baker and Steve Albini. Appearances on the album include label-mates Shipping News, Rachel&#x27;s and Heather Macintosh.

&quot;Over the Sun&quot; recorded with Steve Albini; although Wright had recorded with Albini before on several occasions (&quot;Maps of Tacit&quot; &amp; &quot;Dyed in the Wool&quot;), this was the first time Wright and Albini completed a full-length record together. This album comes closest to capturing her raw live-performances.

&quot;Yann Tiersen and Shannon Wright&quot;; Sharing 50–50 songwriting credits with French musician and composer Yann Tiersen.

&quot;Let in the Light&quot; recorded with Andy Baker. Wright moves back to her slightly simpler instrumentation and recording styles, exploring experimental and unorthodox piano melodies with a bit of classical influence. &quot;Shannon Wright is an example of that shocking, spooky thing: a natural.&quot; – The New York Times

&quot;Honeybee Girls&quot; Piano, organ, guitars, violin, cello with indistinct tones.

&quot;Secret Blood&quot;

&quot;In Film Sound&quot; was recorded in 2013 with Kevin Ratterman in Louisville, Kentucky. Recorded mostly live as a three-piece with Todd Cook on bass and Kyle Crabtree on drums.
&quot;It&#x27;s emblematic of the tense, discomforting oeuvre Wright favors from terse noisy bursts of guitar to moody minor key elegies.&quot; – Creative Loafing

&quot;Division&quot; – 2017 album recorded in Paris and Rome at KML Studios with David Chalmin. &quot;Wright&#x27;s songwriting reaches a new perfection in the most tenuous murmurs, where it is still a tear that works, an evil that clings, a fermenting poison. The nuances are all here: less guitar and more piano give the impression of chamber music – but flooded – or aquarium – but overturned. This frightened indecision, this trouble of the eyes too wide open, is the very art of Shannon Wright, very pure singer, too rare.&quot; – Les Inrocks Paris, France

<doc id="668894" wikidata="Q7927958" url="?curid=668894" title="Video news release">
<text>A video news release (VNR) is a video segment made to look like a news report, but is instead created by a PR firm, advertising agency, marketing firm, corporation, government agency, or non-profit organization. They are provided to television newsrooms to shape public opinion, promote commercial products and services, publicize individuals, or support other interests. News producers may air VNRs, in whole or in part, at their discretion or incorporate them into news reports if they contain information appropriate to a story or of interest to viewers.

Critics of VNRs have called the practice deceptive or a propaganda technique, particularly when the segment is not identified to the viewers as a VNR. Firms producing VNRs disagree and equate their use to a press release in video form and point to the fact that editorial judgement in the worthiness, part or whole, of a VNR&#x27;s content is still left in the hands of journalists, program producers or the like. The United States Federal Communications Commission is currently investigating the practice of VNRs.

==Details==
Most VNRs feature a professional news reporter, someone with on-air news experience, or an actor. VNRs also often include interviews with experts (who often have legitimate, if biased, expertise); so called &quot;man on the street&quot; interviews with &quot;average&quot; people; and pictures of celebrities, products, service demonstrations, corporate logos and the like, where applicable. In some cases the &quot;man on the street&quot; segments feature persons randomly selected and interviewed spontaneously, and in other cases actors are hired and directed by VNR producers to deliver carefully scripted comments. In addition, regardless of whether real people or professional actors appear, VNR producers and directors, just like journalists, have complete discretion to excerpt and edit these &quot;interviews&quot; into &#x27;sound bites&#x27; that help make the point they are trying to make.

== Media broadcasting ==

Commercial television stations and other media outlets often broadcast only portions of a VNR. Sometimes they use the script provided by the VNR producer but frequently they write their own script.

In a report released on April 6, 2006, the Center for Media and Democracy listed detailed information on 77 television stations that it said had broadcast VNRs in the prior 10 months, and which VNRs had been broadcast. Most of these VNR uses were of partial feeds. However, CMD said that in each case the television station actively disguised the VNR content to make it appear to be its own reporting, and that more than one-third of the time, stations aired the pre-packaged VNR in its entirety.

==Business production in the United States==
VNRs have been used extensively in business since at least the early 1980s. Corporations such as Microsoft and Philip Morris, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, have all made use of the technique.

According to the trade-group Public Relations Society of America, a VNR is the video equivalent of a press release. and presents a client&#x27;s case in an attractive, informative format. The VNR placement agency seeks to garner media attention for the client&#x27;s products, services, brands or other marketing goals. The VNR affords local TV stations free broadcast quality materials for use in reports offered by such stations.

Public Relations agencies have their video tapes encoded allowing very accurate tracking of where such video is used. (see: SIGMA (verification service) for additional information).

One critic of the VNR technique, John Stauber, an observer and critic of the Public Relations business says, &quot;These fellows are whistling past the graveyard, assuring themselves that this all is no big deal. There was no hint of shame, certainly no apologizing, just apparent disdain for having their business practices dissected on the front page of the New York Times. They are proud of their work.&quot;

*The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported in March 2005 that &quot;In all, at least 20 federal agencies, including the Defense Department and the Census Bureau, have made and distributed hundreds of television news segments in the past four years, records and interviews show. Many were subsequently broadcast on local stations across the country without any acknowledgement of the government&#x27;s role in their production.&quot;
*A VNR financed by the Department of Health and Human Services was aired on a number of local news programs around the country, as conventional journalism when in fact, it was produced to promote the new Medicare plan. The creation of the Karen Ryan video, named so because of the on-screen &quot;reporter,&quot; was ruled in May 2004 to be in violation of federal law by the General Accounting Office (GAO), the investigative arm of the U.S. government.
*In September, 2005, the GAO concluded that the Department of Education had violated the law when it distributed a similar video news release using Karen Ryan as a &quot;reporter&quot; touting the No Child Left Behind program of the Bush administration. In May 2003 the Department had hired the Ketchum public relations firm; the contract specified, among other things, that the firm create &quot;audio products, videos and some print materials that present clear, coherent, targeted messages regarding ED’s programs and that relate to the Department’s legislative initiatives&quot;.
*A website of the Census Bureau informs visitors: &quot;U.S. Census Bureau Video News Feeds are available for creation of state-specific news reports. Targeted comments are provided by Census Bureau Redistricting Data Office Chief, Marshall Turner. Companion notification material includes references to websites for the newly released information. Please contact...Homefront Communications for hardcopies on Betacam SP and faxed/email notification copy.&quot;
*In May 2020, multiple television stations aired a PR piece produced by Amazon.com that defended its response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with anchors reading off an identical script vertabatim.

==VNRs and U.S. law==
* In January 1948, the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, also known as the Smith-Mundt Act, was passed by Congress and signed into law by U.S. President Harry Truman, placing international overseas information activities, including VOA, under an Office of International Information at the Department of State.
*In February 2005, the &quot;Stop Government Propaganda Act&quot; was introduced in the U.S. Senate. It was referred to the Judiciary Committee and no further action occurred.
*In April 2005, the Federal Communications Commission warned television stations that they could be fined for airing news stories provided by the government and by companies without disclosing who made them.
*In May 2006, FCC chairman Kevin Martin ordered a review of airing of VNRs by television stations, following the April 2006 report by the Center for Media and Democracy.
*In August 2006, the FCC mailed letters to the owners of 77 television stations, asking for information regarding agreements between the stations and the creators of VNRs. The letters also asked whether there was any &quot;consideration&quot; given to the stations in return for airing the material. Stations were given 60 days to respond.

<text>Translink is the brand name of the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company (NITHCo), a public corporation providing public transport in Northern Ireland. NI Railways, Ulsterbus, Goldliner, Metro and Glider are all part of Translink. It is led by CEO Chris Conway.

Translink provides services all over Northern Ireland and also to Dublin, in a partnership deal with its counterpart in the Republic of Ireland, Córas Iompar Éireann (CIÉ), through its subsidiary Iarnród Éireann / Irish Rail. It also provides local bus services in many towns and cities all over Northern Ireland including Bangor, Derry, Ballymena, Omagh, Craigavon and Antrim. The Metro service operates throughout Belfast, right out to the suburbs.

NITHCo was established in 1967 to take over the railway and bus services of the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA), namely Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and Ulsterbus. In 1996 the Translink organisation was created to integrate the services of the Ulster Transport Authority as well as Citybus Limited (Belfast only – successor to the Belfast Corporation Transport Department). Citybus is now known as Metro.

==Northern Ireland Railways==

Northern Ireland Railways (NIR), formerly and briefly called Ulster Transport Railways (UTR), is responsible for running the railway network in Northern Ireland. The Northern Irish railway network is currently .

The main passenger line operates from Portadown to Bangor. In addition to this, Translink also provides rail services between Belfast and Derry to the north and Newry to the south, continuing across the border, which is part of the fast &quot;Enterprise&quot; service between Belfast and Dublin. Also operated are services to Larne and Portrush, which is a branch off the Belfast-Derry railway line, at Coleraine.

In 2014, Translink announced that they were looking at proposals for a service operating from Belfast International Airport to Belfast city centre. These included proposals to reopen the Lisburn-Antrim railway line, which was closed to passenger trains in June 2003 in favour of the Bleach Green line which provides a direct line between Belfast and Derry. The Lisburn-Antrim line passes Belfast International Airport and could be used to provide services to it. However, despite general political support from the Northern Ireland Assembly, there has been no movement on these proposals to date.

==Ulsterbus==
Ulsterbus is responsible for most of the bus services in Northern Ireland. They operate around 20 bus stations which include: Armagh, Antrim, Lisburn, Bangor, Newtownards, Downpatrick, Newry, Craigavon, Dungannon, Omagh, Enniskillen, Derry, Coleraine, Ballymena, Magherafelt, Larne and Newcastle and others within Belfast and 1,100 buses. Ulsterbus is charged with transporting over 65,000 children per day to school.

===Goldliner===

Goldliner is the name given to the key Inter-urban bus services operated by Ulsterbus linking major cities in the Northern Ireland and cross-border services into the Republic of Ireland. Amongst these are the flagship routes 212/X212 &#x27;Maiden City Flyer&#x27; from Belfast to Derry &amp; the &#x27;Xpress&#x27; branded routes X1 and X2 from Belfast to Dublin/Dublin Airport.

There are is a cross channel (North Channel) service 923 Belfast – Glasgow &amp; Edinburgh via Belfast Harbour and Stranraer.

===Urby===

On 7 August 2018, Translink launched the new Urby bus service. This service makes use of double deck buses built by Wrightbus and feature free Wi-Fi, leather seats and USB charging ports, with buses running on improved schedules. Two Urby networks were launched, with the first introduced along commuter routes such as in June 2018 to operate in Ballyclare, Bangor, Newtownards and Dromore, and another introduced to Ballygowan, Comber and Moneyreagh in September 2019.

===Contract hire and tours===
Translink provides a number of hire services to the public. Ulsterbus formerly operated &quot;Day Tours&quot; through Ulsterbus Tours to other parts of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain mainly for shopping and visits to tourist attractions. Ulsterbus Tours was closed in September 2020 due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Translink.

==Metro==

The Translink Metro service (previously Citybus) operates bus services within the Greater Belfast Area. Metro operates 12 bus corridors (QBCs) in Belfast, plus a number of additional routes.

The service began as the Belfast Corporation Transport Department. In 1973, these services were transferred to the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company as Citybus Limited, becoming part of the &quot;Translink&quot; integrated network in 1995. In 2004, Translink/NITHC announced that Citybus would be completely rebranded &amp; reorganised into 12 QBCs and integrated with Ulsterbus services in the Greater Belfast area. Citybus was re-branded as Metro on 7 February 2005.

==Foyle Metro==

Foyle Metro is a division of Translink that operates bus services in Derry. The service was opened in August 2017 following a 3m investment to update the city&#x27;s bus routes and replace some of the older buses. 38 battery electric buses, including Wright GB Kites and Wright StreetDeck Electroliners, were delivered to convert the Foyle Metro fleet to zero emission in May 2023.

Foyle Metro operates across 13 key corridors from the city centre, with an additional route 14A/B/C orbiting the city&#x27;s north side from Ballymagroarty to Currynierin via Altnagelvin Hospital.

== Belfast Rapid Transit System – Glider ==
The Belfast Rapid Transit System, which became operational on 3 September 2018, is a bus service run by Translink. The routes are served by 34 18-metre bendy buses, branded as Glider, built by Van Hool and specifically designed for Belfast.

They feature real time passenger information, destination announcements, CCTV, free Wi-Fi, USB charging facilities, air conditioning, and operate every 7–8 minutes throughout the working day. Route G1 links the Park and ride facility at Dundonald in East Belfast with the McKinstry Road roundabout in West Belfast whereas Route G2 connects the Titanic Quarter with the city centre.

The service is expected to help meet the future transport needs of Belfast.

== Translink Future Ticketing System ==

In 2018, Translink announced a new payments and ticketing system to be used across all of its public transport services in Northern Ireland. The scheme includes the installation of 4500 ticket vending machines, 300 of which will be inside of train and bus stations and in Belfast City Centre, and passengers would be able to pay for journeys either using a contactless credit or debit card, or an &quot;Oyster-Style&quot; &#x27;ePurse&#x27; prepaid smartcard, which can be topped up online or via a mobile app, though paper tickets will still remain available. The first part of the system had been initially rolled out alongside introduction of the Glider Bus Rapid Transit system in 2018. The new ticketing system is expected to be fully rolled out by the end of 2022, and is expected to have cost £43 million upon completion. When completed, the new fare system would become the largest of its type in the United Kingdom outside of Greater London.

==Criticisms==
Translink received criticism in 2008 from Consumer Council Chief Executive, Eleanor Gill for providing inadequate service despite raising fares at a greater rate than inflation. She told BBC News that &quot;passengers will rightly ask why average fare increases on Ulsterbus and Metro are above inflation while punctuality and reliability are below their target.&quot;

In February 2020 a senior civil servant issued a stark warning on the future of Northern Ireland&#x27;s public transport network due to funding concerns. The civil servant said if Translink&#x27;s funding problems got to the level of closing railway lines and non-profitable bus routes, any cuts would need to be agreed by Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon.

In 2021, Translink spent around £15,000 on a new logo design which led to public spending campaigners criticising the &quot;costly redesign&quot; at a time when Translink was facing serious funding pressures and cuts to services. Translink said the new design helps to &quot;modernise and simplify the brand presence&quot;, confirming the cost of the design in response to a Freedom of Information request from Belfast Live.

<text>Francis Place (3 November 1771, London – 1 January 1854, London) was an English social reformer described as &quot;a ubiquitous figure in the machinery of radical London.&quot;

==Background and early life==
He was an illegitimate son of Simon Place and Mary Gray. His father was originally a journeyman baker. He then became a Marshalsea Court officer, and ran a sponging-house in Vinegar Yard, off Brydges Street, opposite the south side of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Francis Place was born there on 3 November 1771, and baptised at St Martin-in-the-Fields, on 1 December 1771. His older sister, Hannah, had been born there on 17 April 1770. Shortly the family moved to a house in Ship and Anchor Court, near Temple Bar, London. His younger brother George was born there in August 1773, and then a younger sister Ann, in June 1775.

In June 1780, Simon Place became a publican and moved his family to the &quot;Kings Arms,&quot; in Arundel Street, off the Strand.

===Marital status of Simon Place===
In Place&#x27;s autobiography, he stated that his mother&#x27;s maiden surname was Gray but he did not know where his parents had met, or when they married. His mother said that she had married Simon at age 25, which Place presumed was in 1755 or 1756.

Around 1785, Simon Place was involved in a suit in the ecclesiastical court of St Clement Danes parish: a woman named Anna Place had come to the Overseers and claimed parish aid, as the wife of Simon Place of Arundel Street. She had a daughter named Mary, who was by then the wife of Henry Kitchin of Clerkenwell. The Parish Officers advised Simon to make a weekly allowance for her, but Simon refused, saying that Anna was not his wife. Anna claimed that she was the wife of Simon from a Fleet marriage which had occurred around 40 years earlier to this. The case lasted for some years, and was lost by Simon, with heavy costs. It established that Simon Place (surname as &quot;Plaise&quot; in the register) had married Anna Peters at Fleet Prison, on 29 October 1747. This was only four days after Mary Place, daughter of Simon, was baptised at St Anne&#x27;s Church, Soho.

==Career as tailor==
Francis Place was schooled in London until 1785, on his own account mostly in the three Rs. At the end of his school time he was head boy in the school of Mr Bovis. On 20 June 1785, he was apprenticed to Joseph France, a leather-breeches maker in Temple Bar. At 18, Place was an independent journeyman. His apprenticeship with France was terminated early, an outcome attributed to a quarrel with Simon Place. 

In 1799 Place became the partner with Richard Wild in a tailor&#x27;s shop at 29 Charing Cross. A year later he set up his own successful tailoring business at 16 Charing Cross. He retired as a tailor in 1817, still drawing an income from his shop which was carried on by his children.

==Activist==
In 1793 Place became involved in and eventually the leader of a strike of leather-breeches makers, and was refused work for several years by London&#x27;s master tailors; he exploited this time by reading. He went on to participate widely in the next four decades of reform activity, often consulted by other reformers. He had as rival William Cobbett, according to G. D. H. Cole &quot;quite as much of an egotist as Place himself&quot;. Edward Pearce wrote:

The point so rarely grasped is how difficult it was to be Paine, Cobbett, Place, Hunt, Carlile and Attwood.

Place dropped out of political activities at times. He withdrew into family life for six years from 1799 while he established his own business. His experiences in 1814 saw him pull back. In 1817 he stayed for a visit of several months with Jeremy Bentham and James Mill at Forde Abbey. But he was absent from the radical agitation of 1816 to 1818. He worked in the early 1820s as a mentor to Joseph Hume, closely and effectively but not without some friction.

===London Corresponding Society===

In 1794, Place joined the London Corresponding Society (LCS), a reform club. He was introduced by the shoemaker John Ashley (c. 1762–1829), a friend, who had taken over from Thomas Hardy as the society&#x27;s secretary. Hardy had been arrested in connection with the 1794 Treason Trials, and the radical reformers had been infiltrated by spies. Place came in as an organiser, and for several years was prominent in the LCS. Among the LCS members was the gunmaker Richard Fenton, who became a friend. It was Fenton who introduced Place to his business partner Richard Wild.

Place resigned his post as chairman of the general committee in 1797. He left the LCS as one of a Godwinite group who wished to proceed by publication and discussion of reformist ideas, rather than political agitation. Arrests in 1798, however, of LCS members Thomas Evans and Alexander Galloway saw Place organise subscriptions of support for Janet Evans, sister of Galloway and married to Evans. John Fenwick (died 1823), a journalist and &quot;literary mentor&quot; to Place, was another LCS member, husband of Eliza Fenwick and an associate of Godwin and Thomas Holcroft.

===Radical contacts===
Place established a library of reform literature at 16 Charing Cross, and it became a meeting place for radicals. He came into contact with James Mill. Through Mill, he met Jeremy Bentham in 1812. With Bentham, Place contacted Thomas Hodgskin, William Thompson and John Wade. He knew also Robert Owen and John Stuart Mill.

===Education===
Place had some experience with the Lancasterian method of teaching. The West London Lancasterian Association, however, became an unfortunate experience for him: he and his ally John Richter were pushed off the committee by Francis Burdett in 1814, in a high-handed move with some Spenceans accusing them of being spies.

At the time of the founding of the London Mechanics&#x27; Institution in 1823, Place was involved with George Birkbeck, in fund-raising. His proposals were unpopular with the radicals Hodgskin and Joseph Clinton Robertson, who looked for greater autonomy, but were carried through.

===Malthusian===
In the early 1820s, Place also became a Malthusian and believed that population increase would outstrip the food supply. He advocated the use of contraception. He published &quot;Illustrations and Proofs of the Principles of Population,&quot; in 1822, engaging with the views of both Thomas Malthus and William Godwin. In 1823, with Benthamite volunteers and anonymous backers, he launched a handbill campaign, concentrating on London&#x27;s Spitalfields area. He advocated forms of contraceptive sponge, as well as coitus interruptus. The effort tarnished his reputation for many years, but provoked further pioneering works in English by Richard Carlile, Robert Dale Owen and Charles Knowlton.

===Labour law===
Place, working with Joseph Hume, lobbied successfully for the 1824 repeal of the Combination Act 1799. The change in legislation had the effect of removing legal obstacles to strikes in much of the economy. It also meant that trade union organisation was no longer a common law criminal offence. Many strikes followed. In 1825 the common law status of trade unionism was reversed.

== Later life ==
In 1830, Place helped support Rowland Detrosier, a working class radical activist who also sought to distance himself from socialism. Through Place, Detrosier would be introduced to figures such as Bentham and J.S. Mill, who in turn introduced him to Thomas Carlyle. Detrosier&#x27;s activities and writings would be influential amongst Manchester Radicals and the later Chartists. He was also active in the agitation that led to the Reform Act 1832, holding up the recent revolution in Paris as an example of what could happen if reform was not allowed by legal means.

Having financial troubles in 1833, Place had to move from Charing Cross to Brompton Square. He worked against the stamp tax. In the London Working Men&#x27;s Association, he and William Lovett in 1838 drafted the document that became the People&#x27;s Charter. Some Chartists were willing to use violent means, and when Feargus O&#x27;Connor replaced Lovett as the effective leader of the movement, Place dropped Chartist activities. He then became involved in the movement to repeal the Corn Laws. In later life he wrote his autobiography and organised the collections he had made: notes, pamphlets, newspapers and letters. He suffered a stroke in 1844, that left him partially disabled. 

Francis Place died around midnight on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1854. He was buried on 7 January, at Brompton Cemetery.

==Views==
An early formative influence on Place&#x27;s political opinions was &quot;Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot; (1793) by William Godwin. He took from it a type of Radical utilitarianism, and also a distrust of &quot;abstract rights&quot;. He later could be considered a follower of Jeremy Bentham. He came to prefer the utilitarian ideas of James Mill.

Place was a Burdettite—an active supporter of Francis Burdett, with whom he shared the aim of an extension of the franchise—at least for periods 1807 to 1812, and 1818 to 1820. His support was largely expressed in organisational work for Burdett&#x27;s electoral committee in the Westminster constituency.

Place&#x27;s efforts on labour law were in a context assuming collective bargaining was effective. Place himself regarded trade unionism as a delusion that workers would soon forget about if they were allowed to try it.

On 7 March 1791, Place was married to Elizabeth Chad at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lambeth. At the time, Place was 19, and his bride was three weeks short of her seventeenth birthday. They moved to a house near the Strand. The couple had 15 children, of whom 8 reached adulthood.
In 1827, Place entered a long period of depression after the death of his wife from cancer. On 13 February 1830, in Kensington, he married, secondly, Louisa Chatterley, a London actress. He separated from his wife in 1851. He then went to live in Hammersmith for two years with his daughter Annie, the wife of John Miers, and their family. He brought a house at 6, Foxley Terrace, Earls Court, Kensington, and lived there with his two unmarried daughters, Mary and Jane. Francis Place died at this address on the morning of 1 January 1854.

==Legacy==
Place&#x27;s pamphlets, letters, magazine and newspaper articles throw light on the social and economic history of the nineteenth century. His hoarding of documents created a major archive. The British Library currently holds these documents in fifty-four reels of micro-film as the Francis Place Collection. A diary he kept from 1825 to 1836 was published in 2007.

Place is listed on the Reformers&#x27; Memorial in Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

<text>Coccydynia is a medical term meaning pain in the coccyx or tailbone area, often brought on by a fall onto the coccyx or by persistent irritation usually from sitting.

==Synonyms==
Coccydynia is also known as coccygodynia, coccygeal pain, coccyx pain, or coccalgia.

==Anatomy==

===Structure===
Coccydynia occurs in the lowest part of the spine, the coccyx, which is believed to be a vestigial tail, or in other words the &quot;tail bone&quot;. The name &quot;coccyx&quot; is derived from the Greek word for &#x27;cuckoo&#x27; due to its beak-like appearance. The coccyx itself is made up of three to five vertebrae, some of which may be fused together. The ventral side of the coccyx is slightly concave whereas the dorsal aspect is slightly convex. Both of these sides have transverse grooves that show where the vestigial coccygeal units had previously fused. The coccyx attaches to the sacrum from the dorsal grooves, with the attachment being either a symphysis or as a true synovial joint, and also to the gluteus maximus muscle, the coccygeal muscle, and the anococcygeal ligament.

===Orientations of the coccyx===
There are four different orientations for the coccyx, as described by Postacchini and Massobrio. In type I the coccyx is curved anteriorly with its apex facing downward and caudally. In type II this forward curvature is more dramatic and the apex extends forward. Type III is where the coccyx angles forward sharply. Lastly, type IV is characterized by the coccyx being subluxated at the sacrococcygeal joint.

===Pathophysiology===
There are common pathophysiological ways that a person may develop coccydynia. The two main causes for this condition are sudden impact due to fall, and coccydynia caused by childbirth pressure in women. Other ways that coccydynia develops are partial dislocation of the sacrococcygeal synchondrosis that can possibly result in abnormal movement of the coccyx from excessive sitting, and repetitive trauma of the surrounding ligaments and muscles, resulting in inflammation of tissues and pain.

==Diagnosis==
A number of different conditions can cause pain in the general area of the coccyx, but not all involve the coccyx and the muscles attached to it. The first task of diagnosis is to determine whether the pain is related to the coccyx. Physical rectal examination, high-resolution X-rays and MRI scans can rule out various causes unrelated to the coccyx, such as Tarlov cysts and pain referred from higher up the spine. Note that, contrary to most anatomical textbooks, most coccyxes consist of several segments: &#x27;fractured coccyx&#x27; is often diagnosed when the coccyx is in fact normal or just dislocated at an intercoccygeal joint.

A simple test to determine whether the coccyx is involved is injection of local anesthetic into the area. If the pain relates to the coccyx, this should produce immediate relief.

If the anesthetic test proves positive, then a dynamic (sit/stand) X-ray or MRI scan may show whether the coccyx dislocates when the patient sits.

Use of dynamic X-rays on 208 patients who gave positive results with the anesthetic test showed:

*31% not possible to identify the cause of pain
*27% hypermobility (excessive flexing of the coccyx forwards and upwards when sitting)
*22% posterior luxation (partial dislocation of the coccyx backwards when sitting)
*14% spicule (bony spur) on the coccyx
*5% Anterior luxation (partial dislocation of the coccyx forwards when sitting)

This study found that the pattern of lesions was different depending on the obesity of the patients: obese patients were most likely to have posterior luxation of the coccyx, while thin patients were most likely to have coccygeal .

===Angle of incidence===
Sagittal coccygeal movement is measured using the angle of incidence—or the angle at which the coccyx strikes the seat when an individual sits down. A smaller angle indicates the coccyx being more parallel to the seat, resulting in flexion (or &quot;normal&quot; movement) of the coccyx. A larger angle indicates the coccyx being more perpendicular to the seat, causing posterior subluxation (or &quot;backward&quot; movement) of the coccyx.

==Causes==
One way of classifying coccydynia is whether the onset was traumatic versus non-traumatic. In many cases the exact cause is unknown and is referred to as idiopathic coccydynia.

Coccydynia is a fairly common injury which can often result from falls, particularly in sports such as cycling, skateboarding, skating or ice hockey.
Coccydynia is often reported following a fall or after childbirth. In some cases, persistent pressure from activities like bicycling may cause the onset of coccyx pain. Coccydynia due to these causes usually is not permanent, but it may become very persistent and chronic if not controlled. Coccydynia may also be caused by sitting improperly thereby straining the coccyx.

Rarely, coccydynia is due to the undiagnosed presence of a sacrococcygeal teratoma or other tumor in the vicinity of the coccyx.

==Prevalence==
A study of 2000 cases of back pain referred to hospital found that 2.7% were diagnosed as coccydynia. This type of pain occurs five times more frequently in women than in men. It can occur at any age, the mean age of onset being around 40. There are no ethnicity or race associations with coccydynia.

==Clinical features==
Activities that put pressure on the affected area are bicycling, horseback riding, and other activities such as increased sitting that put direct stress on the coccyx. The medical condition is often characterized by pain that worsens with constipation and may be relieved with bowel movement. Rarely, even sexual intercourse can aggravate symptoms.

==Non-surgical treatment==
Since sitting on the affected area may aggravate the condition, a cushion with a cutout at the back under the coccyx is recommended. If there is tailbone pain with bowel movements, then stool softeners and increased fiber in the diet may help. Anti-inflammatory medications such as NSAIDS may be prescribed.

If the pain persists, other treatments may be applied. Manual treatment is carried out by repeated massage of the muscles attached to the coccyx, via the anus. Such treatment is usually given by an intimate partner, chiropractor, osteopath or physical therapist. Thiele applied this treatment to a series of 169 coccydynia patients, and reported 63% cured.

Orthopaedic surgeons commonly inject corticosteroids into the painful joint. Maigne and Tamalet applied this treatment to 86 patients under fluoroscopic guidance. Two months after the injection, 50% of the patients with luxation or hypermobility were improved or healed, but only 27% of the patients with no visible abnormality improved. Where an abnormality had been found, and injection relieved the pain, the abnormality remained but ceased to be painful.

Temporary or permanent nerve blocks are sometimes applied in cases of coccydynia. Foye et al. reported that repeated temporary nerve blocks by injection at the ganglion impar could give relief in a number of cases, and occasionally a single injection was sufficient.

==Surgical treatment==
If non-surgical treatments fail to relieve the pain, or in cases of cancer, surgery to remove the coccyx (coccygectomy) may be required. In cases where pain persists after surgery, standard drugs for chronic pain, such as tricyclic antidepressants, may help alleviate the pain.

==Prevention or to ease coccyx pain==

Body positioning and alignment is significant for producing less stress in the coccyx region. Bad posture can influence coccyx pain. People may not realize that they are over-stressing their coccyx while doing daily activities. Pain in the coccyx can be caused from many incidents like falling, horseback riding, or even sitting on hard surfaces for a long period of time. The main focus is to prevent coccyx pain from occurring by correcting everyday activities that contribute to tailbone pain. Hot or cold water baths may help. Running a stream of hot or cold water down the back continuously may help if pain becomes unbearable. Cold water can be used if pain persists, with the procedure repeated in intervals of 5–6 minutes.

===Proper equipment used to preventing coccyx pain===
There is no definite way to fully prevent coccyx pain because an accident can occur at any given time. However, people who are obese are at a higher risk for developing coccyx pain. Carrying excessive weight contributes to more stress on the coccyx while sitting down causing increased chances of pain.
Prevention of carrying excessive weight gain can help reduce the tension and pressure on the coccyx. In other words, the coccyx for obese people may be more posteriorly outward when they are sitting down. Avoidance of contact sports like basketball, football, and or hockey can decrease the risks of coccyx pain, because it can help reduce the chances of falling.
Another method is proper safety equipment for sports is to prevent coccyx pain. For example, hockey pants that provide extra cushion to protect the thigh, coccyx, and buttocks are available.

===Stretches and strengthening exercises for prevention===
A kneeling groin stretch can help prevent coccyx pain from occurring after long periods of sitting. The adductor magnus is involved in the kneeling groin stretch, and when it is tight it can contribute to tailbone pain, so stretching can help prevent tailbone pain. Other stretches like piriformis stretch, and hands to feet stretch, can relieve stress from the muscles around the coccyx after sitting for a long time. These release tension built up around the muscles in the coccyx.

<doc id="668926" wikidata="Q2719502" url="?curid=668926" title="Iron Flag">
<text>Iron Flag (titled as Wu-Tang Iron Flag on streaming platforms) is the fourth studio album by American East Coast hip hop collective Wu-Tang Clan, released on December 18, 2001, on Loud Records. It was certified gold in sales by the RIAA. &quot;Iron Flag&quot; served as the group&#x27;s second lowest-selling album (687,000 copies), as their record label, Loud, was on the verge of shutting down at the time. The album debuted at No. 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 153,000 copies sold in its first week of release. It has sold over half a million copies in the United States and certified Gold by the RIAA. Rapper Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard is completely absent from the album.

==Background==
A gap of four years separated both the first and second albums; and three years between the second and third albums; with those gaps being filled by a myriad of solo projects. It was consequently surprising to many when the Clan reformed for a new LP only a year after their well-received 2000 album &quot;The W&quot;, with only RZA&#x27;s &quot;Digital Bullet&quot; and Ghostface Killah&#x27;s &quot;Bulletproof Wallets&quot; released in between. The album&#x27;s promotion was also quite low-key, particularly in comparison to the fanfare, hype and expensive videos that had preceded the release of the group&#x27;s two previous albums. Unusual for hip hop albums of the time, &quot;Iron Flag&quot; only consists of twelve tracks (which contain thirteen songs plus a short introduction) with no interludes or skits between songs. This is similar to &quot;The W&quot;, which only consisted of thirteen tracks (though unlike &quot;Iron Flag&quot; it did feature interludes and skits).

==Artwork==
The album cover is inspired by the 1945 photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot;.

==Absences==
Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard&#x27;s contributions to the Wu-Tang&#x27;s group albums continued to decrease with each successive album: after being one of the main stars of &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;, he was by far the least prolific Clan member on the group&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;. He then made only one appearance on &quot;The W&quot; (on the song &quot;Conditioner&quot;) due to being engulfed in legal troubles; which in the year separating &quot;The W&quot; and &quot;Iron Flag&quot; had only gotten worse. Consequently, Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard does not appear on &quot;Iron Flag&quot; at all, making &quot;The W&quot; the final Wu-Tang album to feature him. He does, however, appear on &quot;8 Diagrams&quot; posthumously.

Another absentee is Cappadonna who after being merely a very close affiliate of the group on &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot;, he appeared to have become absorbed into the group itself as a full member on &quot;The W&quot; (tracks with his contributions no longer being marked as &quot;featuring Cappadonna&quot;). In the year following the release of &quot;The W&quot;, Cappadonna had become dissatisfied with being in the group (RZA has said he felt unhappy that people outside of the group did not respect him as much as the original nine members) and had also been in dispute with the group over the revelation that his manager Michael Caruso was a police informant. Whatever the case, he only appears once on the album in a bridge for the hidden song, &quot;Da Glock&quot;. He appears on the original cover of the album but was air brushed out. The original cover appears on the back of the &quot;Wu-Tang Manual&quot; by RZA. This suggests that he might have been removed from the album in post production.

==Revisiting old sounds==
Rather than stick to one unified sound for most of the album&#x27;s tracks, as with previous Clan albums, much of &quot;Iron Flag&quot; returns to many different individual sounds and styles that the Wu-Tang had visited over the years:
*&quot;Chrome Wheels&quot; uses the synthesizer-heavy &quot;digital orchestra&quot; sound of RZA&#x27;s &quot;Bobby Digital In Stereo&quot; (RZA also raps in the song as his Bobby Digital persona, and Bobby Digital is name checked in the bridge (sung by Madame D). &quot;Dashing (Reasons)&quot; also uses the Bobby Digital sound, with the Digital trademarks of the off-kilter keyboard riff, a high-pitched portamento sine wave synthesizer, and prominent synthesized hi-hats.
*&quot;Radioactive (Four Assassins)&quot; is firmly in the gritty, foreboding style of the Wu-Tang&#x27;s debut album &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;: it has a recurring dialogue sample from a martial arts movie, short and indistinct one-note samples buried in the mix, a quickly looping ascending bassline, and hard, pounding drums. The beat also incorporates the sound of shuriken throwing blades, which are &quot;launched&quot; with a single B note, before the sound effect pans from right to left then back again before dissipating. The repeated horn blare at the start of every bar is also reminiscent of Public Enemy, particularly &quot;Night of the Living Baseheads.&quot;
*&quot;Iron Flag&quot; has all the hallmarks of the &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; sound: string samples coupled with subtle keyboards and a sped-up vocal sample (a technique which was pioneered by the RZA on &quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; but which by the time of Iron Flag&#x27;s release had been widely imitated by many, most notably Just Blaze and Kanye West).
*&quot;Uzi (Pinky Ring)&quot; recalls &quot;The W&quot;&#x27;s murky blaxploitation-influenced atmosphere with its dramatic horn riffs and gritty drums. &quot;Soul Power (Black Jungle)&quot; is also reminiscent, albeit to a lesser extent, of &quot;The W&quot;.

==Wu-Elements contributions==
Many of the remaining tracks sound little like much the Clan had done before, and little like each other. This may be a result of the collaborators involved: all of the above tracks are produced by the RZA, whereas of the remaining six, only two are RZA produced. Two are produced by in-house Wu-Elements producers True Master and Mathematics:

*True Master&#x27;s &quot;Y&#x27;all Been Warned&quot; is a simple one-bar composition with a funky guitar riff over a steady rhythm and a deeply buried piano sample. The advance copy of &quot;Iron Flag&quot; featured a slightly different version of this song which featured a synthesizer line over the top of the guitar riff. It is not known why this was changed for the final release.
*Mathematics&#x27; &quot;Rules&quot; features a pattern of one bar repeated three times then a one-bar turnaround. The repeated bar features four samples layered in a vaguely call-and-response structure: an initial horn sample is answered by a James Brown grunt, which is answered by a two-chord piano sample, which is answered by another James Brown grunt. The horn sample is highest in the mix and effectively &quot;leads&quot; the other samples. The turnaround bar has two descending chords with a high-pitched picked guitar riff, bringing the four-bar pattern to the start once again. With its intro of scratched samples of various Wu-Tang lyrics, this track can be viewed as reminiscent of hip-hop producer DJ Premier&#x27;s distinctive style.

Though these two producers are known for their distinctly traditional Wu-Tang sound, these two beats do not particularly resemble much of the Clan&#x27;s previous output, at least not as a group. If anything, they resemble some of the sharp 1970s soul-influenced funk tracks from the Wu-Tang&#x27;s 1999–2000 solo albums (U-God&#x27;s &quot;Dat Gangsta&quot; and &quot;Soul Dazzle&quot; from &quot;Golden Arms Redemption&quot;, Inspectah Deck&#x27;s &quot;Word on the Street&quot; and &quot;Movers and Shakers&quot; from &quot;Uncontrolled Substance&quot;).

==Outside collaborators==
There had been some discontent among fans and critics when &quot;The W&quot; included non-Wu Tang affiliated hip hop crossover superstars Busta Rhymes and Snoop Dogg. Nevertheless, &quot;Iron Flag&quot; also makes use of non-Wu artists well known in their own right: Flavor Flav of Public Enemy provides the chorus for &quot;Soul Power (Black Jungle)&quot;, and &quot;Back in the Game&quot; features both pop-rap hitmakers Trackmasters and soul legend Ronald Isley. Nick &quot;Fury&quot; Loftin also produces &quot;One of These Days&quot;, sampling Donny Hathaway&#x27;s rendition of Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;I Believe to My Soul&quot; for its hook and using a fairly generic coupling of muffled horn stabs and soul guitar.

&quot;Back in the Game&quot; opens with the same vocal sample (&quot;if what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous!&quot;) as 36 Chambers, but it sounds little like anything the Clan had done before; it also sounds little like well-known Trackmasters hits of the time, such as R. Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Fiesta&quot; (apart from its use of bongos). A delicate piano melody is layered over a heavy organ vamp and a stumbling, complex rhythm.

A number of critics, such as the NME&#x27;s Ted Kessler and &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Nathan Rabin, saw Flavor Flav&#x27;s appearance as a way to temporarily fill the clownish role of the absent Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard. Flav sings the call-and-response chorus of &quot;Soul Power (Black Jungle)&quot; with U-God, and has a long conversation with Method Man in the song&#x27;s outro about growing up in Long Island, where Flav hails from.

<doc id="668934" wikidata="Q7893894" url="?curid=668934" title="Universal C*-algebra">
<text>In mathematics, a universal C*-algebra is a C*-algebra described in terms of generators and relations. In contrast to rings or algebras, where one can consider quotients by free rings to construct universal objects, C*-algebras must be realizable as algebras of bounded operators on a Hilbert space by the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction and the relations must prescribe a uniform bound on the norm of each generator. This means that depending on the generators and relations, a universal C*-algebra may not exist. In particular, free C*-algebras do not exist.

== C*-Algebra Relations ==

There are several problems with defining relations for C*-algebras. One is, as previously mentioned, due to the non-existence of free C*-algebras, not every set of relations defines a C*-algebra. Another problem is that one would often want to include order relations, formulas involving continuous functional calculus, and spectral data as relations. For that reason, we use a relatively roundabout way of defining C*-algebra relations. The basic motivation behind the following definitions is that we will define relations as the category of their representations.

Given a set &quot;X&quot;, the &quot;null C*-relation&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is the category formula_1 with objects consisting of pairs (&quot;j&quot;, &quot;A&quot;), where &quot;A&quot; is a C*-algebra and &quot;j&quot; is a function from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;A&quot; and with morphisms from (&quot;j&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) to (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) consisting of *-homomorphisms φ from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; satisfying φ ∘ &quot;j&quot; = &quot;k&quot;. A &quot;C*-relation&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is a full subcategory of formula_1 satisfying:
# the unique function &quot;X&quot; to {0} is an object;
# given an injective *-homomorphism φ from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and a function &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, if φ ∘ &quot;f&quot; is an object, then &quot;f&quot; is an object;
# given a *-homomorphism φ from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and a function &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, if &quot;f&quot; is an object, then φ ∘ &quot;f&quot; is an object;
# if &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; is an object for &quot;i&quot;=1,2...,n, then formula_3 is also an object. Furthermore, if &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot; is an object for &quot;i&quot; in an nonempty index set &quot;I&quot; implies the product formula_4 is also an object, then the C*-relation is &quot;compact&quot;.

Given a C*-relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot;. then a function ι from &quot;X&quot; to a C*-algebra &quot;U&quot; is called a &quot;universal representation&quot; for &quot;R&quot; if
# given a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; and a *-homomorphism φ from &quot;U&quot; to &quot;A&quot;, φ ∘ ι is an object of &quot;R&quot;;
# given a C*-algebra &quot;A&quot; and an object (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) in &quot;R&quot;, there exists a unique *-homomorphism φ from &quot;U&quot; to &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;f&quot; = φ ∘ ι. Notice that ι and &quot;U&quot; are unique up to isomorphism and &quot;U&quot; is called the &quot;universal C*-algebra for R&quot;.

A C*-relation &quot;R&quot; has a universal representation if and only if &quot;R&quot; is compact.

Given a *-polynomial &quot;p&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot;, we can define a full subcategory of formula_1 with objects (&quot;j&quot;, &quot;A&quot;) such that &quot;p&quot; ∘ &quot;j&quot; = 0. For convenience, we can call &quot;p&quot; a relation, and we can recover the classical concept of relations. Unfortunately, not every *-polynomial will define a compact C*-relation.
== Alternative Approach ==

Alternatively, one can use a more concrete characterization of universal C*-algebras that more closely resembles the construction in abstract algebra. Unfortunately, this restricts the types of relations that are possible. Given a set &quot;G&quot;, a &quot;relation&quot; on &quot;G&quot; is a set &quot;R&quot; consisting of pairs (&quot;p&quot;, η) where &quot;p&quot; is a *-polynomial on &quot;X&quot; and η is a non-negative real number. A &quot;representation&quot; of (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) on a Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; is a function ρ from &quot;X&quot; to the algebra of bounded operators on &quot;H&quot; such that formula_6 for all (&quot;p&quot;, η) in &quot;R&quot;. The pair (&quot;G&quot;, &quot;R&quot;) is called &quot;admissible&quot; if a representation exists and the direct sum of representations is also a representation. Then
:formula_7
is finite and defines a seminorm satisfying the C*-norm condition on the free algebra on &quot;X&quot;. The completion of the quotient of the free algebra by the ideal formula_8 is called the &quot;universal C*-algebra&quot; of (&quot;G&quot;,&quot;R&quot;).
== Examples ==
* The noncommutative torus can be defined as a universal C*-algebra generated by two unitaries with a commutation relation.
* The Cuntz algebras, graph C*-algebras and k-graph C*-algebras are universal C*-algebras generated by partial isometries.
* The universal C*-algebra generated by a unitary element &quot;u&quot; has presentation formula_9. By continuous functional calculus, this C*-algebra is the algebra of continuous functions on the unit circle in the complex plane. Any C*-algebra generated by a unitary element is isomorphic to a quotient of this universal C*-algebra.

<text>HMS &quot;Arab&quot; (1896 to 1897 Programme) was a torpedo boat destroyer of the British Royal Navy. She was laid down by J &amp; G Thomson at Clydebank and completed by John Brown &amp; Company who took over the yard.

==Construction and design==
As part of the 1896–1897 construction programme for the Royal Navy, the British Admiralty placed orders for thirty torpedo boat destroyers. Of these ships, 17 were required to meet the standard contract speed of , while the remaining three destroyers, with one each ordered from Laird, Thornycroft and J &amp; G Thomson, were required to reach higher speeds, with Thomson&#x27;s and Thornycroft&#x27;s designs (built as &quot;Arab&quot; and ) contracted for while Laird&#x27;s ship, , had a speed of specified.

&quot;Arab&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced light and full load. Four coal-fed Normand boilers, with four funnels, fed two triple expansion steam engines rated at which drove two propeller shafts. Sufficient coal was carried to give a range of at .

She carried the specified armament for the thirty-knotters of a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun on a platform on the ship&#x27;s conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship&#x27;s bridge), with a secondary armament of five 6-pounder guns, and two 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. While the ship carried the same armament as normal thirty-knotter destroyers, the more powerful engines needed more coal and hence more stokers were needed to feed the coal to the engines, with &quot;Arab&quot;″s crew being 69 officers and men, compared to 63 for thirty-knotters built by Thomsons.

Construction work on &quot;Arab&quot; was delayed owing to problems during the sea trials of the thirty-knotter destroyers built by Thomsons under the 1895–1896 programme, which required significant modification to reach the required speed. &quot;Arab&quot; was finally laid down on 5 March 1900 and launched on 9 February 1901. &quot;Arab&quot; ran 9 trials between 11 March and 27 May 1901, but like the other two high-speed destroyers ordered under the 1896–1897 programme, failed to meet the contracted speed, with the maximum speed reached only . She was delivered to the Royal Navy on 20 October 1902, with the Admiralty imposing a £3000 penalty owing to the ships failure to meet contract speed, the final price paid being £63,642.

==Service==
&quot;Arab&quot; served in home waters for the whole of her career. She was commissioned at Portsmouth by Commander Hubert Brand on 12 January 1903, to relieve the HMS &quot;Success&quot; as senior officer′s ship in the Portsmouth Instructional Flotilla. &quot;Arab&quot; was refitted in 1908, having her boilers retubed. In 1910, &quot;Arab&quot; was part of the Fifth Destroyer Flotilla at Devonport, serving as part of that flotilla until 1912. On 30 August 1912 the Admiralty directed all destroyers were to be grouped into classes designated by letters based on contract speed and appearance. Four-funneled, 30-knotter destroyers were grouped as the , and &quot;Arab&quot; was assigned to this class. By March 1913, &quot;Arab&quot;, still based at Devonport, was part of the Seventh Destroyer Flotilla, one of four flotillas equipped with old destroyers and torpedo boats for patrol purposes.

Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Seventh Flotilla moved to the East coast of England. In November 1914 &quot;Arab&quot; was transferred to Scapa Flow as one of a force of 29 destroyers used for local patrols of this vital naval base. In April 1917, the German submarine carried a series of attacks on shipping between Bergen in Norway and Lerwick in Shetland. &quot;U-30&quot; sank five ships on 13 April, and sank another, by gunfire on the morning of 14 April. The crew of the Norwegian merchant ship SS &quot;Rondane&quot;, sailing astern of &quot;Fjeldi&quot;, abandoned ship on seeing the attack, but &quot;Arab&quot; managed to force &quot;U-30&quot; to submerge before the submarine could attack &quot;Rondane&quot;, allowing the Norwegian ship&#x27;s crew to reboard her. On 7 July 1917, &quot;Arab&quot; was part of the escort of a Norway-bound convoy when a submarine was spotted. The yacht &quot;Amalthaea&quot; and whaler &quot;Pilot Whale&quot; opened fire on the submarine, while &quot;Arab&quot; attacked with depth charges, driving the submarine away from the convoy. On 19 July 1917, &quot;Arab&quot; and the destroyer were escorting an east-bound convoy on the Scandinavian (Lerwick–Norway) route, when the convoy came under attack by the German submarine , which sank the Danish steamer . &quot;Arab&quot; successfully rescued the 19-strong crew of the merchant ship.

&quot;Arab&quot; remained based at Scapa until January 1918, but then transferred to the Firth of Forth as part of the Methil Convoy Flotilla. By May 1918, &quot;Arab&quot; transferred to the Seventh Flotilla, based on the Humber, remaining there until the end of the war.

&quot;Arab&quot; was sold for scrap on 23 July 1919.

<text>Irina Konstantinovna Rodnina (; born 12 September 1949) is a Russian politician and retired figure skater, who is the only pair skater to win 10 successive World Championships (1969–78) and three successive Olympic gold medals (1972, 1976, 1980). She was elected to the State Duma in the 2007 legislative election as a member of President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s United Russia party. As a figure skater, she initially competed with Alexei Ulanov and later teamed up with Alexander Zaitsev. She is the first pair skater to win the Olympic title with two different partners, followed only by Artur Dmitriev.

==Early life and family==
Rodnina was born in Moscow on 12 September 1949. Her father was Russian Red Army officer Konstantin (Nikolaevich) Rodnin, from a village named Yaminovo on the outskirts of Vologda. Her mother was Ukrainian Jewish paramedic Yulia (Yakovlevna) Rodnina. Her parents met each other during the Second World War, and both took part in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria against the Empire of Japan as the war came to a close. She has an older sister, Valentina, who works as an engineer. As a young child, Rodnina was often sick, suffering from pneumonia eleven times. On the advice of her doctor to give Rodnina additional exercise and outdoor time, and in 1954 took her to an ice rink for the first time at Pryamikov Children Park of Moscow.

==Figure skating career==
Since the sixth form of secondary school, age 13, she trained at Children and Youth Sports School of CSKA on Leningradsky Prospekt.

By 1963, Rodnina had begun skating with her first partner Oleg Vlasov, coached by Sonia and Milan Valun. In 1964, her coach became Stanislav Zhuk, who paired her with Alexei Ulanov. Rodnina/Ulanov won their first World title in 1969, ahead of Tamara Moskvina/Alexei Mishin. They won four consecutive World titles.

Rodnina and Ulanov won their next two World titles, 1970 and 1971, ahead of silver medalists Lyudmila Smirnova/Andrei Suraikin. However, Ulanov fell in love with Smirnova, and prior to the 1972 Olympics, the couple made the decision to skate together the following season. Rodnina/Ulanov went on to compete at the 1972 Olympics where they captured the gold. They then prepared for their last competition together, the 1972 World Championships. While practicing together a day before the start of the competition, the pair had an accident on a lift and Rodnina ended up in hospital with a concussion and an intracranial hematoma. Despite the accident, they had a strong showing in the short program, receiving some 6.0s. In the long program, Rodnina became faint and dizzy but it was enough for their fourth World title. Ulanov continued his career with Smirnova, while Rodnina considered retirement.

In April 1972, her coach Stanislav Zhuk suggested she team up with the young Leningrad skater Alexander Zaitsev, who had good jumping technique and quickly learned the elements. Their music stopped during their short program at the 1973 World Championships, possibly due to a Czech worker acting in retaliation for the suppression of the Prague Spring. Known for intense concentration, they finished the program in silence, earning a standing ovation and a gold medal upon completion, ahead of Smirnova/Ulanov, whom they again defeated in 1974.

In 1974, Rodnina/Zaitsev left Zhuk, with whom the working relationship had become strained, to train with Tatiana Tarasova. They won six consecutive World titles together, as well as seven European gold medals, and won their first Olympic title together in 1976. Rodnina/Zaitsev did not compete during the 1978–79 season because she was pregnant with their son who was born on 23 February 1979. They returned in 1980 to capture their second Olympic title together and Rodnina&#x27;s third. At the age of 30 years and 159 days, she became one of the oldest female figure skating Olympic champions. They then retired from competitive skating.

Throughout her career, Rodnina competed internationally for the Soviet Union and represented the Armed Forces sports society at the national level. Rodnina, along with Ulanov and her later partner Alexander Zaitsev &quot;completely dominated international pair skating throughout the 1970s&quot;. With her partners, she won ten World Championships and three consecutive Olympic gold medals from 1971 to 1980, a record that equaled Sonia Henie&#x27;s, along with eleven European titles, making her the most successful pair skater in history. She was one of the first female pair skaters to be known for her athleticism and ever-increasing dangerous tricks. She and her partners were also known for their acrobatic lifts, side-by-jumps, and for the split triple twist. In the early 1990s, she coached at the Ice Castle International Training Center in Lake Arrowhead, California.

=== Comments on doping ===
In a 1991 interview, Rodnina said she was aware that Soviet figure skaters had used doping substances since the early 1970&#x27;s in preparation for the competitive season. According to Rodina &quot;Boys in pairs and singles used drugs, but this was only in August or September. This was done just in training, and everyone was tested (in the Soviet Union) before competitions.&quot;

==Political career==
Rodnina became a member of the Public Chamber of Russia in 2005. In the 2007 legislative election, she was elected to the State Duma as a member of President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s United Russia party. On 17 December 2012, Rodnina supported the Dima Yakovlev Law, the law in the Russian Parliament banning adoption of Russian orphans by citizens of the United States.

; Sanctions
Rodnina was sanctioned by the United Kingdom from 15 March 2022 in relation to Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine.

In December 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament sanctioned Rodnina for her support of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In 2023, she supported Poland&#x27;s decision to boycott the Olympic Games in case Russian athletes are allowed to compete, saying that it would mean &quot;Poland gets banned for the next two Olympic cycles&quot;.

==Personal life==
Rodnina graduated from the Central Institute of Physical Culture. Her first marriage was to Alexander Zaitsev, with whom she has a son of the same name, born in 1979. From her second marriage with the film producer Leonid Menkovsky, Rodnina has a daughter, Alyona Minkovski, born in 1986. She is currently divorced. She spent a number of years living in the United States and then moved back to Russia.

===Twitter controversy===
On 13 September 2013, Rodnina caused a stir when she tweeted a doctored photo of U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, with Obama&#x27;s mouth full of food, with a photoshopped banana in the image&#x27;s foreground. She said she was practicing her right to free expression, but critics claimed she was making a racist comment about the African-American president. On 10 February 2014, Rodnina in her Twitter claimed that her account was hacked at the time of posting the offensive photograph and apologized for her handling of the affair.

<doc id="668941" wikidata="Q617753" url="?curid=668941" title="Belus (Egyptian)">
<text>In Greek mythology, Belus () was a king of Egypt and father of Aegyptus and Danaus and (usually) brother to Agenor. The wife of Belus has been named as Achiroe or Side (eponym of the Phoenician city of Sidon).

==Family==
Belus was the son of Poseidon and Libya. He may also be Busiris, son of Libya, ruler of Egypt, killed by Heracles, although Heracles was born many generations after Belus since he was a great-grandchild of Perseus; see Argive genealogy below. 

Apollodorus also claims that Agenor was Belus&#x27; twin brother. Belus ruled in Egypt, and Agenor ruled over Sidon and Tyre in Phoenicia. The wife of Belus has been named as Achiroe, daughter of the river-god Nilus. Her sons Aegyptus and Danaus were twins. Later Aegyptus ruled over Egypt and Arabia, and Danaus ruled over Libya. Apollodorus says that it was Euripides who added Cepheus and Phineus as additional sons of Belus.

In the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot;, Belus was also the father of a daughter named Thronia on whom Hermaon, i.e. Hermes, fathered Arabus, presumably the eponym of Arabia.

According to Pherecydes of Athens, Belus also had a daughter named Damno who married Agenor (Belus&#x27; brother, her uncle) and bore to him Phoenix and two daughters named Isaie, and Melia, these becoming wives respectively to sons of Belus (their cousins) Aegyptus and Danaus. Yet another source says that the daughter of Belus who married Agenor was named Antiope.

Some sources make Belus the father of Lamia while Antoninus mentions him as the father of Thias (father of Smyrna) by the nymph Orithyia.

Nonnus makes Belus the father of five sons, namely Phineus, Phoenix, Agenor (identified as the father of Cadmus), Aegyptus, and Danaus, though Nonnus elsewhere makes Phineus to be Cadmus&#x27; brother. Nonnus has Cadmus identify Belus as &quot;the Libyan Zeus&quot; and refer to the &quot;new voice of Zeus Asbystes&quot;, meaning the oracle of Zeus Ammon at Asbystes.
== Mythology ==
Diodorus Siculus claims that Belus founded a colony on the river Euphrates, and appointed the priests-astrologers whom the Babylonians call Chaldeans who like the priests of Egypt are exempt from taxation and other service to the state.

According to Pausanias, Belus founded a temple of Heracles in Babylon. Meanwhile, it was said that Egyptians initially fought with clubs but later on Belus invented the use of sword in fighting. The word bellum, &quot;war,&quot; is named from this.

==Belus and Bel Marduk==
Pausanias wrote:
&quot;&lt;Ruler&gt; Manticlus founded the temple of Heracles for the Messenians; the temple of the god is outside the walls and he is called Heracles Manticlus, just as Ammon in Libya and Belus in Babylon are named, the latter from an Egyptian, Belus the son of Libya, Ammon from the shepherd-founder. Thus the exiled Messenians reached the end of their wanderings.&quot;
This supposed connection between Belus of Egypt and Zeus Belus (the god Marduk) is likely to be more learned speculation than genuine tradition. Pausanias seems to know nothing of supposed connection between Belus son of Libya and Zeus Ammon that Nonnus will later put forth as presented just above.

==Belus and Ba&#x27;al==
Modern writers suppose a possible connection between Belus and one or another god who bore the common northwest Semitic title Ba&#x27;al. According to some sources, Belus was the son of Poseidon by Libya. Bel is associated with Babylon and Assyria, but Aegean Greeks had a distant relations with that area, in contrast they had trading relationships with north Canaanites of Syria, Ugarit and Levantine Sidon and Tyros, cities that are mentioned in Greek myths about Belos, and his name is an echo of the Canaanite god &quot;Baal&quot; (Redfield, 1989, pp. 28 &amp; 30–31), which in Akkadian Babylonian scripts is replaced with &quot;Enlil&quot;, both meaning &quot;lord&quot;, and may be connected with &quot;Marduk&quot;, but the most probable connection in ancient Levantine/Canaanite mythology is Baal Hadad, a fertility god, whose attributes are lightning, rainstorms and the forces of nature.

<text>Amy Tuck (born July 8, 1963) is an American attorney and politician who served as the 30th Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi from 2000 to 2008. A member of the Republican Party, she was previously a member of the Mississippi State Senate. She is the second woman to be elected to statewide office in Mississippi, and the first to have been reelected. Tuck later served as the Vice President of Campus Services at Mississippi State University from 2008 to 2019.

==Biography==
Tuck was born in Maben, Oktibbeha County, Mississippi in 1963. Her father, Grady Tuck, ran a grocery store near Maben, and was a lifelong friend of politician Brad Dye. As a high school student in Starkville, she also served as a page in the Mississippi Legislature. She received Bachelor of Arts in political science and Master of Public Administration degrees from Mississippi State University in Starkville before obtaining a J.D. degree from Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. After graduating, Tuck worked as an attorney and as a teacher at a junior college.

On December 18, 1990, she defeated Bryce Griffis in a special election (called after the death of incumbent senator Bill Harpole) to the Mississippi State Senate as a Democrat, representing the 16th District, comprising parts of Choctaw, Montgomery, Oktibbeha, and Webster counties. At age 27, Tuck was the youngest-ever woman to serve in the Mississippi State Senate. In 1995, she was an unsuccessful candidate for Secretary of State, narrowly losing the Democratic primary to eventual winner Eric Clark. Following her defeat, she served as secretary of the Mississippi Senate from 1995 to 1999. Tuck was elected lieutenant governor in 1999, defeating Republican state senator Bill Hawks.

In 2002, Tuck announced her intention to qualify for reelection as a Republican, effectively switching parties. In her announcement, she cited ongoing disagreement with the Democratic state legislature concerning redistricting as well as her conservative stances on abortion, same-sex marriage, and criminal justice reform as motivating factors for her decision to switch parties. The next year, in 2003, she was nominated as the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor and went on to defeat former Democratic state senator Martin Blackmon in the general election with 61% of the vote. Due to term limits, Tuck was ineligible for reelection as lieutenant governor in 2007. She was succeeded by Phil Bryant on January 10, 2008.

In October 2007 it was announced that Tuck would be appointed as special assistant to Mississippi State University President Doc Foglesong upon expiration of her term as lieutenant governor. In this role, Tuck took a leading role in facilitating the university&#x27;s economic development and private sector initiatives. Upon the retirement of Foglesong in March 2008 and the selection of Mark E. Keenum as his successor, Tuck was named the Vice President of Campus Services, a new position. In this position she oversees the university&#x27;s facilities, parking and transit, sustainability, planning, and utilities divisions. Tuck announced in October 2019 that she would retire from her position as vice president on December 31, 2019, and was succeeded by former MSU finance head Don Zant.

<doc id="668947" wikidata="Q5522373" url="?curid=668947" title="Garden of Allah Hotel">
<text>The Garden of Allah was a famous hotel in West Hollywood, California, United States (then an unincorporated area of Los Angeles which was usually considered a part of Hollywood), at 8152 Sunset Boulevard between Crescent Heights and Havenhurst, at the east end of the Sunset Strip.

Originally a estate called Hayvenhurst, it was built in 1913 as the private residence of real estate developer William H. Hay. Alla Nazimova acquired the property in 1919: she converted it into a residential hotel in 1926 by adding 25 villas around the residence, which opened as the &quot;Garden of Alla Hotel&quot; in January 1927. In 1930, new owners renamed it the &quot;Garden of Allah Hotel&quot; (adding an &#x27;h&#x27;). The property operated under a succession of owners for three decades until the last, Bart Lytton, owner of Lytton Savings &amp; Loan, demolished the hotel in 1959 and replaced it with his bank&#x27;s main branch. The Lytton Savings main branch was later demolished along with a strip mall next to it to make way for a mixed-use development designed by Frank Gehry.

== History ==

=== Hayvenhurst ===

The estate that later became the Garden of Allah Hotel was built in 1913 by real estate developer William H. Hay in the northwest corner of the Crescent Heights neighborhood, a tract bounded by Sunset Boulevard on the north, Santa Monica Boulevard on the south, Crescent Avenue (later renamed Fairfax Avenue) on the east and Sweetzer Avenue on the west, which Hay had subdivided and developed starting in 1905.

The estate&#x27;s original address was 8080 Sunset Boulevard but was later changed to 8152. It occupied a lot that fronted Sunset Boulevard and was bounded by Crescent Heights Boulevard on the east and Hayvenhurst (now spelled Havenhurst) Drive on the west. The property&#x27;s southern boundary was also the border between the Hollywood district of the city of Los Angeles and the then-unincorporated area that later became the city of West Hollywood.

Hay and his wife Katherine personally supervised construction of the estate. The house had twelve rooms and four bathrooms. The finishes were all in Circassian walnut that the Hays had collected on a trip to the Philippines in 1912. The interior walls were covered in canvas and hand-painted. The garage had bays for two cars—a rarity in those days—with rooms upstairs for live-in servants. Construction and landscaping cost an estimated $30,000.

The Hays&#x27; stay at Hayvenhurst was short-lived. Within a few years they had built and moved into a new house a few blocks east, at 7920 Sunset Boulevard, the site today of the Directors Guild of America headquarters. William Hay also purchased Encino Ranch, a large tract of land in the San Fernando Valley that he would later develop into the upscale Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Hayvenhurst reportedly stood unoccupied for several years.

=== Garden of Alla ===

Stage and screen actress Alla Nazimova leased Hayvenhurst from William Hay not long after she moved to Los Angeles from New York in 1918. She purchased it outright in 1919. Nazimova jokingly called her new home &quot;The Garden of Alla&quot;, which was a reference to her own name and the best-selling 1904 novel &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;, by British author Robert S. Hichens.

Faced with a financial crisis in the mid-1920s after her screen career derailed, Nazimova put her property to work generating an income by building a complex of 25 rental &quot;villas&quot; around the original house. The opening party for &quot;The Garden of Alla Hotel&quot; was held on January 9, 1927. She found her role as a hotel manager unsuitable and discovered that her unscrupulous partners in the enterprise had nearly bankrupted her, so in 1928 she sold out her remaining interest in the property, auctioned off most of her furniture and other household goods, and went back to the Broadway stage. By 1930, the owners had normalized the spelling in the hotel&#x27;s name to &quot;Allah&quot;.

After Nazimova&#x27;s renewed Broadway success was cut short by illness in 1938, she returned to Hollywood and rented Villa 24, where she lived until her death in 1945.

=== Garden of Allah Hotel ===
Catering to both short-term and long-term guests, the hotel soon gained a reputation as a place where the famous could enjoy living in a quaint, cozy, village-like setting, conveniently located yet shielded from gawking tourists and autograph seekers by discreet security patrols, under a management that was not inclined to probe, judge or interfere with the private — and sometimes public — activities of its often unconventional patrons.

The Garden of Allah became home to many celebrities and literary figures. F. Scott Fitzgerald lived there for several months in 1937–38 at the beginning of his final stay in Hollywood. He wrote himself a postcard while there: &quot;Dear Scott — How are you? Have been meaning to come in and see you. I have living [sic] at the Garden of Allah. Yours, Scott Fitzgerald.&quot; Fitzgerald&#x27;s biographer and lover Sheilah Graham later wrote a book about the place, titled simply &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot;.

Humorist and actor Robert Benchley was a frequent resident. An array of Golden Age Hollywood stars and featured players, ranging from Greta Garbo to Ronald Reagan, stayed there at least briefly, and so did classical music giants Sergei Rachmaninoff (who was musically assaulted there by an annoyed Harpo Marx), Igor Stravinsky and Jascha Heifetz. Humphrey Bogart lived in villa 8, where Errol Flynn stayed when Bogart was out of town. Gloria Stuart and Arthur Sheekman lived at villa 12. Dance band leaders Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw and vocalist Frank Sinatra were among the pop music personalities. Kay Thompson, then designing musical numbers for Judy Garland and her own nightclub act with The Williams Brothers, lived there; Thompson later wrote about a little girl who also lived in a hotel, &quot;Eloise&quot;.

=== Purchase by Lytton Savings and the site today ===

Although celebrities such as Errol Flynn were still calling it home as late as 1957, by that time the hotel&#x27;s architectural style was long out of fashion and its environs had become more tacky than glamorous. Land values were rising, historic preservation was still an eccentric notion, and &quot;redevelopment&quot; was a popular civic buzzword.

On April 11, 1959, Bart Lytton, president of Lytton Savings and Loan, announced that he had purchased the Garden of Allah Hotel from Beatrice Rosenus and Morris Markowitz for $755,000. Lytton&#x27;s plans for the property included razing the hotel to make way for a new main branch for his bank, which had formerly been headquartered in the Canoga Park neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley.

On August 22, 1959, Lytton hosted a farewell party on the grounds of the hotel. Among the attendees was silent film star Francis X. Bushman, who had been at the opening party in 1927. Some other guests came costumed as old-time stars. In a nod to the hotel&#x27;s creator, Nazimova&#x27;s experimental 1923 silent film &quot;Salomé&quot; was shown on a large poolside screen. On August 30, an on-site public auction liquidated all the furnishings, fixtures and equipment, along with odds and ends valuable only as souvenirs. Demolition permits were issued on November 2. Within days, all traces of the hotel were gone and construction of the bank building, designed by the Los Angeles-based architect Kurt Meyer in the Brutalist architectural style, had begun. The bank building was completed by 1960. By 1962, the bank building received an adjacent addition consisting of a museum and an auditorium called the Lytton Center. By 1968, only eight years after the bank building&#x27;s completion, Lytton Savings was forced to declare bankruptcy, resulting in the closure of the bank building. The adjacent Lytton Center was later closed the following year and converted into a strip mall. By the time the 2010s rolled around, the building was now home to a Chase bank. In 2016, the building was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument. However, in the same year, real estate developer Townscapes Partners secured approvals for a mixed-use development designed by architect Frank Gehry, which would require the razing of the former bank building. In response to this, the Los Angeles Conservancy and Friends of Lytton Savings advocacy group waged a preservation campaign to help prevent the building&#x27;s demolition but ultimately, it was unsuccessful. By April 2021, the building was demolished while the adjacent strip mall (formerly Lytton Center) was demolished much later. As of 2023, the redevelopment of the site failed to push through, leaving the site nothing but an empty lot.

=== Miniature model ===

In 1960, the Garden of Allah reappeared on the site in the form of a detailed miniature model of the complex. For many years, this was on display outside Lytton&#x27;s building, in a small plaza at the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights, sheltered from the elements in a sort of shrine with a lofty domed pavilion. It was later moved indoors and eventually disappeared. It resurfaced in private hands in the early 2010s, architecturally intact and with its built-in miniature electric lighting system restored.

== Source of the name ==

The hotel&#x27;s name was not a direct reference to Islam but rather to Nazimova&#x27;s first name and the title of a 1905 novel, &quot;The Garden of Allah,&quot; by British writer Robert S. Hichens. The novel was adapted into a play first produced in London in 1909. Mary Mannering acted in the play in 1910. The novel also served as the basis for three movies, the final one of which starred Marlene Dietrich, who was once a resident of the hotel.

== In popular culture ==

* In 1956, just a few years before its demise, the Garden of Allah was one of the settings for Pamela Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;Chocolates for Breakfast,&quot; the story of a teenage girl growing up with an actress mother.
* The Garden of Allah Hotel is mentioned in chapter 2 of the Ronald Reagan biography &quot;Killing Reagan&quot; by Bill O&#x27;Reilly. In the late 1940s it was where &quot;Reagan reaches bottom when he wakes up one morning at the Garden of Allah Hotel on Sunset Boulevard and does not know the name of the woman lying next to him&quot;.
* Herman Wouk called the Garden &quot;Rainbow&#x27;s End&quot; in &quot;Youngblood Hawke&quot;, his novel about a successful writer who goes to Hollywood.
* It is apparently an urban legend that the bulldozing of the Garden of Allah in 1959 inspired the line in Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, &quot;They paved paradise and put up a parking lot&quot;. Indeed, Mitchell later lived in the Laurel Canyon neighborhood in the hills north of the site. However, in an interview in the early 1970s, Mitchell stated that the lyrics were inspired in 1970 by her first trip to Hawaii, where she was struck by a jarring juxtaposition of nature and modern civilization. Also, the next line after &quot;They paved paradise and put up a parking lot&quot; is &quot;With a pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot&quot;, which does not reflect what happened to the Garden of Allah site itself, on which a bank building was erected. There was, however, also a large parking lot on the site to serve that building; the nearby Chateau Marmont hotel and at least one other big, pinkish and even nearer residential building overlooked it; boutiques abounded on the Sunset Strip; and the &quot;swinging&quot;, politically hot Pandora&#x27;s Box nightclub was directly across Crescent Heights in the 1960s. The existence of a secondary source of inspiration has apparently not been explicitly denied in Mitchell&#x27;s published comments.
* A 1985 play &quot;Across from the Garden of Allah&quot; by Charles Wood starred Glenda Jackson and Nigel Hawthorne. It was a marital drama set in a hotel across the street from the Garden of Allah.
* The hotel is the setting for a series of historical novels by Martin Turnbull that began with &quot;The Garden on Sunset&quot; (2012).
* In the 2013 film &quot;Gangster Squad&quot;, a signboard reading &quot;Garden of Allah&quot; is seen outside the apartment in which Ryan Gosling&#x27;s character resides, just before the scene in which he wakes up with Emma Stone.
* The location of the Garden of Allah, which is now a bank building, is prominently displayed in a comical scene from the 1987 movie &quot;Barfly&quot; starring Mickey Rourke.
* Former Eagles singer and drummer Don Henley released the 1995 song Garden of Allah in honor of the hotel.
*Jonathan Winters, then appearing on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson, described getting drunk one time with Johnny Carson at the hotel, years before becoming sober.

<text>Richard Henderson Molpus Jr. (born September 7, 1949) is an American businessman and Democratic Party politician who served as Secretary of State of Mississippi from 1984 until 1996. He unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1995 against Republican incumbent Kirk Fordice. He later established a timberland management company. Throughout his public life he has pushed for reforms to support public education and promote racial reconciliation.

Born in Philadelphia, Mississippi, and educated at the University of Mississippi, Molpus worked at his family&#x27;s lumber company before its sale in the 1980s. A staffer for William F. Winter&#x27;s gubernatorial campaigns in 1967, 1975, and 1979, the governor appointed him executive director of the Governor&#x27;s Office of Federal-State Programs. He also lobbied on the governor&#x27;s behalf for education reform in the state legislature.

Molpus successfully ran for secretary of state in 1983, campaigning on his managerial experience and promises to reform the office. Reelected in 1987 and 1991, he reorganized the office through the creation of four departments and shifted its purpose away from clerical duties and towards more active policy engagement. He oversaw the digitization of the office&#x27;s records, the renegotiation of thousands of leases on public lands to raise money for public education, reformed the state&#x27;s election laws, and sought reforms in corporate law and lobbying rules. Molpus unsuccessfully ran for U.S. Senate in 1988, losing the Democratic nomination to Wayne Dowdy and accruing the third highest campaign debt for any senatorial candidate nationwide. In his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1995, his apology for the Mississippi Burning murders, the first by a statewide office holder, was used against him. He started a timberland investment management organization in 1996 and was appointed to the United States Endowment for Forestry and Communities in 2006.

==Early life and education==
Richard Henderson Molpus Jr. was born in Philadelphia, Mississippi, on September 7, 1949, to Richard Henderson Molpus Sr. and Frances Blount. He graduated from Philadelphia High School in 1967, and from the University of Mississippi with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1971. While there he served as president of the Sigma Chi fraternity chapter, and unsuccessfully pushed for the fraternity to racially integrate. He married Sally Galbraith Nash, with whom he had two children, in 1971.

His grandfather, Richard Hezekiah Molpus, established the first sawmill in Philadelphia in 1905 as part of a general merchandise venture, the Henderson-Molpus Company. The corporation later transformed into the Molpus Lumber Company in 1957, focusing its business in wood, and passed to Dick&#x27;s father. Molpus began working for the company at a young age. By the time he was a teenager, he was a certified lumber inspector. He returned to work for the company after graduating from college, assuming temporary control after his father suffered a stroke. He rose to the position of vice president for manufacturing and oversaw the establishment of a second lumber facility in Morton in 1975. The lumber company was sold in the mid-1980s. Molpus served on the board of directors and executive committee of the Mississippi Forestry Association, vice-president of the Mississippi Lumber Manufacturers Association, and on the board of directors of the Morton chamber of commerce.

==Political career==
===Early activities and Winter administration===
During the 1967 Mississippi gubernatorial election, Molpus worked as a youth coordinator in Neshoba County for Democrat William F. Winter&#x27;s unsuccessful campaign. He co-chaired a blue ribbon highway study committee during Governor Bill Waller&#x27;s tenure. He volunteered for Winter&#x27;s 1975 campaign and for his successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. His father was one of Winter&#x27;s leading supporters during the 1967 and 1975 elections, but later supported Republican nominee Gil Carmichael in the 1975 election and Jim Herring in the 1979 Democratic primary. Molpus was Winter&#x27;s first announced appointee when he was selected as executive director of the Governor&#x27;s Office of Federal-State Programs, on November 15, 1979. The office coordinated actions between federal and state agencies.

Together with the state director of administration, Molpus consolidated the office&#x27;s 17 agencies into seven, reducing administrative expenses by 25%. For his work in reducing staff and improving the agency&#x27;s efficiency, he was selected in 1983 as Mississippi&#x27;s Public Administrator of the Year by the American Society for Public Administration. He also helped Winter lobby the Mississippi State Legislature to pass the 1982 Education Reform Act, hosting the governor&#x27;s staff at a cabin he owned for strategy sessions, delivering over 35 speeches to build public support for the bill, and organizing a phone call campaign to pressure a state senator to support the creation of public kindergartens. State Senator Ellis B. Bodron, who was broadly opposed to the legislation, denounced Molpus and other young Winter aides—including Ray Mabus, David Crews, Bill Gartin, Andy P. Mullins, and John Henegan—as the &quot;Boys of Spring&quot;, a moniker in which they thereafter took pride.

===Secretary of State of Mississippi===
====Elections====
Winter&#x27;s tenure sparked a decade of political interest in reforming state government and led to like-minded candidates—many being former members of his administration—to seek elective office. Mississippi Secretary of State Edwin L. Pittman announced that he would run in the 1983 gubernatorial election. Molpus was considered a candidate to succeed Pittman and he considered running for either secretary of state or public service commissioner from the Central District. Molpus announced his resignation from Winter&#x27;s administration effective May 9, and launched his campaign for secretary of state on May 16, 1983. He was the second member of Winter&#x27;s staff to run for statewide office after Mabus announced his campaign for state auditor. During the campaign he was endorsed by the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus and AFL–CIO. Pledging to reorganize the office, he won the Democratic nomination after defeating John Ed Ainsworth in a runoff. Molpus and Ainsworth did not engage in negative campaigning, stating that they had a mutual respect for each other. In the general election he defeated Republican legislator Jerry Gilbreath after he campaigned on his managerial experience and record of helping Winter&#x27;s education reforms succeed.

Molpus announced that he would seek reelection on May 5, 1987, and won in the election. In 1989, he announced that he would run for reelection in the 1991 election and was considering running in the 1995 gubernatorial election. He announced his campaign on January 11, 1991, and facing no opposition in the primary or general elections was elected unopposed.

====Tenure====

Before taking office Molpus announced a reorganization plan for the office in which he would create four new departments to handle administration, public lands and elections, policy development, and securities regulations. He wanted to shift the focus of the secretary of state from clerical and administrative duties to handling education, public lands, securities, and elections. Molpus assumed office on January 5, 1984. The director of the Mississippi NAACP criticized Molpus, among other state officials, for the low number of black people he appointed to office despite having significant black electoral support in the 1983 election.
In 1989 &quot;The Neshoba Democrat&quot; editor Stanley Dearman invited Molpus to partake in a commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Mississippi Burning murders of three civil rights activists in Philadelphia, Mississippi, an event which had stigmatized the town to outsiders and was regarded as politically controversial. Despite concerns from some of his advisers that his involvement in a commemoration would ruin his political career, Molpus agreed to attend and helped to organize a planning committee for the event. He also convinced Governor Mabus to attend with him. On June 21, 1989, Molpus officially apologized to the families of the murdered civil rights workers, saying, &quot;We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago. We wish we could undo it. We wish we could bring them back. Every decent person here feels that way. My heart is full because today we have found a way to ease the burden that this community has borne.&quot; The statement made him the first Mississippi state official to apologize for the murders.

Dearman summarized the public reaction to the speech, saying, &quot;A lot of people were opposed to it, but a lot of people were glad he said it.&quot; Many white Mississippians disagreed with Molpus&#x27; remarks; he received several critical letters and threatening phone calls in response, including 26 death threats. Some Mississippians credited Molpus with restarting public discussion of the murders and their significance in the state. Reflecting on his statements and their impact on his political prospects in 2021, Molpus said, &quot;It was not a mistake to say those words. Things are more important than winning. Governors come and go, but those words are something I still feel good about.&quot;

Molpus supported Steve Patterson&#x27;s bid for the chairmanship of the Mississippi Democratic Party in 1984. He endorsed Mike Espy during his campaign for a seat in the United States House of Representatives during the 1986 election and Epsy&#x27;s victory made him the first black person to represent Mississippi in the United States Congress since the Reconstruction era. He endorsed Bill Clinton during the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries and was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. After several potential candidates declined to serve, Molpus acted as the Mississippi delegation&#x27;s secretary.

Molpus and 41 others founded a Mississippi chapter of the Democratic Leadership Council in 1990. He was elected to the board of officers of the National Association of Secretaries of State, being the only Southerner on the board and became its secretary in 1987, its treasurer in 1988, its vice-president in 1989, and was selected as its president in 1993. He was succeeded by Eric Clark at the secretariat of state on January 4, 1996.

=====Commerce=====

The secretary of state was responsible for administering the Mississippi Business Corporation Law and the Uniform Commercial Code, overseeing public lands and elections, and issuing publications on behalf of the state&#x27;s executive offices and legislature. At that time, the office required $200,000 per year from the state treasury to remain operational. Molpus convinced the legislature to raise the office&#x27;s filing and brokerage fees to the Southeastern average rates in 1985, switching the office&#x27;s source of money from the state general fund to a special self-generated fund. Despite this change, that year the office required an over $70,000 subsidy from the general fund to operate. Molpus also oversaw a $4 million effort in automating the office&#x27;s processes with technology and digitize records. Combined with an uptick in corporate registrations in Mississippi, by the end of the 1992 fiscal year these measures allowed the office to collect enough money to be self-funded and deposit $1.1 million in surplus into the state treasury. Molpus also appointed a 29-person Business Law Reform Task Force in 1986 to lobby for revisions of laws pertaining to corporations, nonprofit organizations, limited parties, and securities. Several reforms were adopted by the legislature in 1987. For his efforts to reorganize the secretary of state&#x27;s office, in 1985 Molpus received the American Society for Public Administration&#x27;s Elected Official of the Year Award.

The secretary of state was &quot;ex offico&quot; the Lands Commissioner of Mississippi and thus supervised more than of 16th Section Land that had been set aside in the early 19th century to raise money for the public schools. In the 1980s much of the property was being leased to private entities for cents an acre under 99-year contracts. The state Reform Act of 1978 stipulated that 16th Section Lands be leased at fair market values. In 1984, Molpus began enforcing the act in order to aid education funding, thus triggering the renegotiation of about 5,000 below-market leases and increasing the amount of revenue to the public schools from those properties during his tenure by $24 million (). He conducted the first price inventory of the 9,561 leases of the 16th Section Lands in the state&#x27;s history and found that less than 15% of the land was being leased for more than $20 per acre while almost half were being leased for less than 50¢ per acre and one-third were being leased for less than 20¢ per acre. The revenue from the leases rose by 28% from $6.9 million in 1983 to $8.9 million in 1985.

Molpus faced opposition from the leaseholders. Some of them demanded that the Mississippi Ethics Commission investigate Molpus, claiming that he was reclassifying the land into forest land to benefit his family&#x27;s lumber business, although his family had sold the business in December 1983, before he took office. Steve Turney, whose land lease rose from 25¢ per acre to around $7 per acre, was one of the opponents. The ethics complaint filed by Turney and 56 others was dismissed by a unanimous vote. Turney filed a lawsuit against Molpus in July 1985, claiming that he was &quot;neglecting his duty with advocating five percent of market value&quot;. He withdrew the lawsuit a few months later due to a jurisdictional error. He later requested that the state attorney general pursue action against Molpus before filing a new lawsuit against Molpus in November, claiming that the secretary of state was using his position to make financial gains through the land reclassification, but he lost and the judge ordered him to pay for the expenses of the lawsuit. The Supreme Court of Mississippi ruled on November 27, affirming the raise in Turney&#x27;s lease. Turney camped outside of Molpus&#x27; office for 23 days in 1986 to protest the changes and ran against him in the 1987 Democratic primary.

=====Education=====

As secretary of state, Molpus held a seat on the Mississippi Board of Education. Molpus and Governor William Allain called for the creation of an education trust fund as revenue meant to implement the Education Reform Act was instead being used by the state legislature to prevent budget deficits. Their proposal was opposed by Speaker Buddie Newman and Sonny Meredith, the chair of the House Ways and Means committee. He co-founded Parents for Public Schools, a group which sought to promote the improvement of public schools, in 1989. Initially confined to a group of largely white-middle-class parents in Jackson, Mississippi who sought to support the local school district, by 1997 it had expanded to 50 chapters scattered across the United States.

=====Electoral matters=====

Governor Allain, Attorney General Pittman, and Molpus were &quot;ex officio&quot; the three members of Mississippi Election Commission. He proposed election reforms which would eliminate the dual voter registration law that required voters to register at the city and county levels, allow circuit clerks to accept voter registration outside of county courthouses, and end runoff elections. He oversaw the 1984 presidential election in the state which was the first time that voters directly voted for the presidential candidates rather than their electors. Molpus successfully pushed for the legislature to reform lobbyist laws to require lobbyists to report all money spent on public officials.

Molpus announced a twenty-five member task force on June 19, 1984, to review Mississippi&#x27;s election laws and recommend improvements. The task force made recommendations that included the at-large election of municipal officials, requiring the usage of electronic voting systems, having a statewide voter registration list compiled by the secretary of state, simplifying the wording for constitution amendment referendums, and requiring political action committees to submit financials reports for state and local elections. At the time forty-nine counties still used paper ballots and would save $473,000 per year by changing to electronic voting. There was also no statewide voter registration list with each county reporting its number of voters which produced figures that were not up-to-date.

Legislation encompassing some of the proposals was passed in 1986, including the extension of voting hours, reduction of the minimum number of poll workers, standardization of prohibited campaign areas, constitutional amendment summaries on ballots, requiring the usage of automated devices to count ballots by counties before 1989, the denial of the right to vote for felons, increasing the number of election commissioners, repealing anti-single shot voting legislation, and other provisions. It was approved by the United States Department of Justice, as required by the Voting Rights Act of 1965, on January 2, 1987. He also supported the revival of state ballot initiatives in 1992.

===1988 U.S. Senate campaign===

Molpus stated in 1987, that he would consider running in the 1988 U.S. Senate election, if John C. Stennis chose not to seek reelection, and campaign correspondence in October showed his interest in running. Stennis stated that he would not run for reelection in the 1988 election. Molpus announced his campaign for the Democratic senatorial nomination on December 1, 1987, with Crews, who worked as Winter&#x27;s press secretary, as his campaign manager. He was criticized for running for another office as he was reelected in 1987. He faced U.S. Representative Wayne Dowdy in the primary. Both men stressed the need for better educational opportunities and economic development. Dowdy won the Democratic nomination. During the campaign he criticized Dowdy for his low voting attendance of 68 percent, a line of rhetoric which was later used by Republican nominee Trent Lott in the general election. Molpus ended his campaign with the third highest debt for any 1988 senatorial candidate in the country at $356,700 (). His outstanding campaign debt and obligations was $439,776 in 1989.

===1995 gubernatorial campaign===

In 1995, Molpus ran for the office of Governor of Mississippi. Easily winning the August 8 Democratic primary over evangelist Shawn O&#x27;Hara with 77.1 percent of the vote, he faced Republican incumbent Kirk Fordice in the general election. Molpus sought to prevail with a coalition of blacks, white progressives, and possibly white blue collar workers. By the 1990s, Mississippi&#x27;s politics were trending in an increasingly conservative direction and the interest in reform initiated by Winter&#x27;s administration was fading. Fordice&#x27;s position was bolstered by the improving economic and fiscal situation of the state in the 1990s, and early polls indicated that he had a large lead. Since both men faced minimal opposition for their party&#x27;s nominations, they were able to concentrate their rhetoric on each other early in their campaigns. Anticipating that Molpus would campaign on education improvements, Fordice proposed a conservative education plan which entailed
allowing local school districts to fund private schools with state funds. Molpus argued that such a scheme would undermine public schools.

During the election, Molpus campaigned for reductions in sales tax on food and government expenditure while proposing the issuing of bonds to finance economic development. Fordice characterized Molpus&#x27; tax plans as inconsistent, given his earlier support for a sales tax increase in 1992. The campaign was marked by personal animosity between the candidates. Fordice portrayed statements from Molpus on the governor&#x27;s policies as veiled attacks on Fordice&#x27;s troubled marriage and claimed that as the Secretary of State was responsible for overseeing elections, Malpus should resign due to a conflict of interest. Malpus rejected the accusation of making personal attacks and refused to resign, calling the suggestion &quot;ridiculous&quot;.
Both men participated in the first-ever political debate held at the Neshoba County Fair in August. A bitter exchange occurred after the moderator questioned Fordice about his troubled marriage, with Fordice answering in defense of himself while pointing his finger at Molpus. Molpus said to the governor, &quot;Your private life doesn&#x27;t interest me ... Your public life is what appalls me,&quot; causing the crowd to go into uproar. In reference to the 1964 Mississippi Burning murders, Fordice said, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you this. I don&#x27;t believe we need to keep running this state by &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot; and apologizing for what happened 30 years ago. This is the &#x27;90s. This is now. We are on a roll. We&#x27;ve got the best race relations in the United States of America.&quot; He finished his remarks by saying, &quot;Never apologize! Never look back! Forward together!&quot; Molpus responded by referring to his 1989 speech, &quot;I apologized to the family, the mother and father and sisters of those three young men who lost their life in Mississippi. I make no apologies to you about that... Kirk Fordice leads more by venom than vision.&quot; In a subsequent interview, he accused the governor of being &quot;openly antagonistic to blacks.&quot;

In October Molpus&#x27; campaign ran a television advertisement featuring his wife criticizing Fordice&#x27;s education policies. Fordice subsequently mocked her voice at a lunch with journalists. Molpus denounced Fordice&#x27;s mimicry, saying &quot;Frankly, I&#x27;d like to take him out behind the woodshed.&quot; Several days later, Fordice approached Molpus after a televised appearance and told him, &quot;This 61-year-old man will take you to the woodshed and I&#x27;ll whip your ass&quot;. Molpus hoped to leverage the incident to his advantage by appealing to more women voters, presenting himself as a gentlemen acting in defense of his wife&#x27;s honor. A poll conducted by Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research in late October showed the margins of support between the two candidates narrowing, with Molpus having picked up additional support from women.

Molpus lost the November 7 election to Fordice, who earned 455,261 votes (55.6 percent). Molpus earned only 364,210 votes (44.4 percent), though he received about 25,000 more votes than Democrat Mabus had in 1991. He garnered less than 20 percent of the white vote while Fordice won fifty-one of the fifty-eight majority white counties, but won twenty-one of the state&#x27;s twenty-four majority black counties. Some observers suggested that white voters wanted to &quot;punish&quot; him for his 1989 comments on the Mississippi Burning murders. Molpus&#x27; supporters accused Fordice of prevailing due to the use of racist dog whistles.

==Business career and later life==
In 1993 Molpus, having already planned to run for governor in 1995, considered pursuing a career in timberland investment management in the event his political ambitions faltered. Following his loss in the gubernatorial race, in 1996 he took out a loan and established the Molpus Woodlands Group (MWG). At the time, it was one of eight timberland investment management organizations in the country. The corporation was to operate by purchasing and managing timberlands on behalf of investors. The company acquired its first client the following year and purchased several thousand acres of timberland. Between 1998 and 2000, MWG acquired 545,000 acres in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Louisiana and Texas. The following year it signed its first contracts with large corporate clients, and by 2004 it was the largest timberland investment management organization in the Southern United States.

In 2004 Molpus helped create the Philadelphia Coalition, an interracial group designed to promote racial justice. That year he also helped organize the 50th anniversary commemoration of the Mississippi Burning murders, and spoke in favor of state and local efforts to reexamine and prosecute the case. The following year, he was inducted into the Mississippi Business Hall of Fame. In 2006 he co-chaired a bond issue campaign for the Jackson Public School District. That year President George W. Bush appointed Molpus chairman of the board of the United States Endowment for Forestry and Communities, a nonprofit created under the terms of the Softwood Lumber Agreement between the United States and Canada designed to promote sustainable forestry and to promote economic development in timber-reliant communities. He was declared one of the Mississippi Center for Justice&#x27;s &quot;Champions of Justice&quot; in 2008. In 2012, he called for Attorney General Eric Holder to block Mississippi&#x27;s new voter ID law stating that it violated the Voting Rights Act.

During the February 20, 2013 episode of the satirical news television program &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, host Jon Stewart satirized Mississippi for failing to fully ratify the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution officially banning slavery until that year. An earlier attempt to ratify the amendment was made in 1995, but the ratification papers—for which the Mississippi Secretary of State was responsible—were never received by the federal government. Molpus maintained that his office had sent copies of the documents to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; and U.S. Senate leaders and &quot;somewhere in between there and Archives, it disappeared.&quot; Stewart mockingly suggested that Molpus had deliberately forestalled the process by destroying the papers. Molpus was shocked by the insinuation, and received numerous emails and phone calls from associates who felt he had been portrayed unfairly. Some people posted defenses of Molpus on the internet. Stewart apologized for the joke the following week, saying his show had erred in using &quot;Dick Molpus ... as an avatar for racial bigotry, forgetting, perhaps that Dick Molpus is a real person with a real record on civil rights&quot; and praised him for having &quot;a long and distinguished record of speaking out for civil rights in Mississippi.&quot; Molpus said, &quot;I accept his apology ... I was so lifted up by the people of Mississippi that kind of rose to my defense.&quot;

Molpus supported Doug Jones in Alabama&#x27;s 2017 U.S. Senate special election, stating that he was a &quot;Southern hero&quot;.

<text>Sant Climent de Taüll (), also known as the Church of St. Clement of Tahull, is a Roman Catholic church in Catalonia, Spain. It is an example of Romanesque architecture. Other influences include the Lombard and Byzantine styles, which can be seen throughout the exterior and interior of the building. The church is a basilica plan structure with three naves, each of them with a terminal apse, and large columns separating the side naves. Connecting to the church is a slim bell tower that has six floors plus a base. The artwork inside the church include the famous mural paintings by the Master of Taüll (contained in the different apses and the keys of the arches), as well as the wooden altar frontal. These works of art represent different aspects of Christianity that can also be found in many other works of art. The most famous fresco, of Christ in Majesty in the main apse of the church, has been moved to the in Barcelona.

== Historical context ==
Sant Climent de Taüll is located in Taüll in the municipality of Valley of Boí, in the province of Lleida, Catalonia, Spain. The exact date of construction is unknown; the church was consecrated on December 10, 1123. In 1064, before Sant Climent de Taüll was constructed, it was an object of sale and exchange by several different counts, including the Counts of Pallars Sovereign (I Artau and his wife Lucia), the Counts of Pallars Jussà (Ramon IV and his wife Valença), as well as tle Erill and other possessions. Sant Climent de Taüll was devoted to and consecrated by Guillem Ramon, Bishop of Roda-Barbastro. One day later Guillem Ramon also consecrated Santa Maria de Taüll, another Romanesque church located near Sant Climent de Taüll.

Sant Climent de Taüll is a Romanesque-style church greatly influenced by the Lombard style, which can be seen through its exterior decoration. The bell tower is an example of Byzantine influence, because it stands out for its verticality. The church was intended as a place for Christian worship, unlike other churches of the time, which were intended as a pilgrimage. The artwork in Sant Climent de Taüll was important in bringing the art into the public atmosphere. The main work of art is the mural painting, located on the central apse of the church. The identity of the painter is unknown, but is referred to as Master Taüll. The altar-frontal was created by a native Catalan artist, possibly in a workshop in La Seo de Urgel.

== Technical analysis ==

Sant Climent de Taüll is the largest, most well preserved, and has the most outstanding architecture out of all the churches in the Valley of Boí. The church is a basilica plan structure, that has three naves (each of them with a terminal apse), and large columns separating the side naves. One of the doorways opens on the west side of the building, with the remains of what might have been a porch. The other openings are located on the south side and on the access tower. The facades of the church do not have any decoration, but the apses have simple Lombard decorations and are built with stone and brick. The central apse on the exterior is decorated by groups of four arches, separated by half columns. The apsidioles (apses on either side of the central apse), have groups of three arches instead of four, with each of the apses having one window each. In addition, the central apse has three arched windows located on ground level and two portholes on either side of the central apse.

In the south corner of the church there is a tall, slim bell tower that has a square plan with a prism-shaped roof. The tower has seven floors (base floor plus six), where the base is the foundation of the entire structure. As we ascend through the bell tower, the structure becomes lighter in weight because of the larger windows near the top of the tower. On each level there are the same number of windows on the four sides of the tower, and there are five arcs in the space around the windows.

Inside Sant Climent de Taüll three naves are separated by three cylindrical columns. The columns are made of amalgamated stone, which support the arcades, and the roof of the church has wooden beams. The first column on the north side of the church near the apse was found to have the inscription of the consecration of the church. This document is painted with white letters on red and black background and is now preserved in the National Museum of Catalan Art. The interior of the church (the walls of the naves, apses and columns) were originally covered with polychrome decoration. In the early twentieth century, the National Art Museum of Catalonia in Barcelona took the mural paintings inside the church to protect and preserve them. An exact replica of the mural painting on the central apse was made in place of the original. However, the original mural painting on the northern apse can only be seen in the National Art Museum of Catalonia. The removal of the mural paintings was done by applying horsehide glue. The hardened glue was then peeled off, carrying the pigments of the mural with it.

Mural painting is an art that is painted and applied to the wall, ceiling or other permanent surfaces that are sufficient in size. The technique used is called fresco, where the paint is applied on plaster on walls and/or ceilings. The pigment is mixed with water on a small layer of wet lime mortar or plaster, where it is later absorbed. After several hours, the plaster dries while reacting with the air. This creates a chemical reaction making the pigment stick to the plaster. Over a long period of time, the painting will end up with brilliant colors. One of the main mural paintings is four meters in diameter located on the central apse. There are several holes, due to excess moisture, on the original mural painting on the central apse that have not been restored. A polychrome wood carving and other objects are also located inside the church, some of which were successfully restored.

Sant Climent de Taüll had the earliest wooden altar-frontal, which was 1.36 m × 0.98 m in size. When it reached Barcelona it was covered with a coat of paint which was removed. An inscription on the center of the upper frame shows that in 1579 the altar-frontal was repainted. The wooden altar frontal is enclosed by a narrow wooden frame, which is held together at the four corners with wooden dowels. The figures were each carved separately, and then were attached to the back of the panel using wooden dowels. The four side divisions contain a blind arcade of three arches, where there are figures located directly underneath. The arches are formed from tall capitals, which are supported by slim colonnettes with torus molding, as well as a high base. The upper right corner is slightly damaged, though some of the original colour can be seen on the lower left corner of the antependium. The frame was painted green and yellow, and there are indications that the frame originally had some stucco ornament. The wooden altar frontal used to have four symbols of the evangelists that had filled the outside of the mandorla, but these have been lost.

== Formal and stylistic analysis ==

Sant Climent de Taüll is a form of Romanesque architecture and contains Romanesque artwork. Romanesque architecture is classified by its semi-circular arches on the buildings. It is also best recognized by its massive size, thick walls, round arches, sturdy piers, groin vaults, large towers and decorative arcading. During the time of Romanesque architecture, many more churches were built than castles. The architecture is often a symmetrical plan, and the exterior of the building is very simplistic with clear forms. The building material for the exterior varies in different structures, although brick is generally used. The arches, doors, windows, vaults and arcades used during this time are almost always semicircular.

Mural decorations were a form of art used during the Romanesque period. The paintings were placed on large wall surfaces and on plain, curving vaults. Often it is seen in a mosaic, where the focal point is the semi-dome of the apse with Christ the majesty in the centre. This is very characteristic of the mural painting located on the central apse in Sant Climent de Taüll. The mural painting of the figure of Christ wears a greyish, white robe with a blue mantle. The volumes in the folds of the robe reflect some movement and realism in the image. Christ is located within a mandorla that has a blue background with a blue and red frame, decorated with pearls and circles. The figure of Christ goes beyond the frame of the mandorla, and his feet are resting on a hemisphere. His face is in a perfect axial symmetry which is framed by long hair. The mandorla is placed on a background of three horizontal parallel bands in the colours blue, ocher and black.

Located underneath the mandorla is a black band with white writing. On each side of the centre window (below the black band) are three arches resting on columns of capitals in green, red and black. In between the figures of the Virgin Mary and five saints are columns with wavy line patterns going vertically. These figures lie on top of a background of three horizontal bands in the colours red, blue and green. The faces of the figures in the bottom half of the mural painting is similar to Christ in the mandorla, except they wear different coloured robes.

Sant Climent de Taüll has a basilica plan structure, which is similar to early Christian architecture such as the Roman basilica of Leptis Magna and the Basilica of Old St. Peter. Similar to early Christian architecture, Sant Climent de Taüll has a central nave and an apse. The difference is that Sant Climent de Taüll has three naves and three apses, and a bell tower, whereas early Christian architecture has side aisles, transepts, a narthex and an atrium. In addition, the Santa Maria Maggiore, a basilica in Rome, has a clerestory, whereas the Sant Climent de Taüll is the opposite because it has very few windows.

The mural paintings in Sant Climent de Taüll have elements similar to early Christian paintings. In the central apse of the church, there is a figure of a Pantocrator (Christ in Majesty) surrounded by a mandorla. The Pantocrator can also be seen in the Golden Age of Byzantium, specifically in Hagia Sophia in Constantinople. It can also be seen in the Court School of Charlemagne during the Carolingian Renaissance. The Alpha, Omega and the halo around Christ&#x27;s head can be seen in both the Romanesque and Byzantium age and in the Catacomb of Comodilla.

==Iconographical analysis ==

Sant Climent de Taüll has many mural paintings; however, the main and most famous mural painting is located at the central apse and is of Christ in Majesty within a mandorla. This has now been moved to Barcelona and replaced by a replica.

In the lower part of the second triumphal arch appears a figure of the Agnus Dei contained in a circle with a blue background. The Agnus Dei is a mystic lamb that is presented as having seven eyes and holding a book. On the left side of the same arc, there are scenes of Lazarus, who expresses grief while a dog licks his wounds at the door of a rich man. On the front, left side of the triumphal arch, there is an image of an unknown character holding a helmet. The vertical walls directly under the triumphal arches preceding the apse have an image of saints. Only a few saints, Peter, Clement, and Cornelius, can be identified. In the triumphal arch on the right side, there is a scene of a man with an ax hitting the head of another person. On the northern side of the apse there is a mural painting of six angels. In front of the apse, there is an image of what appears to be a dog on top of the remains of a frame. Under the dog there is a possible image of some type of bird, though it is hard to make out the exact image.

The church has a wooden altar frontal, which is similar to the mural painting in the central apse, because it consists of Christ in a mandorla surrounded by the four tetramorphs. The figure of Christ wears a crown and is seated on a throne with a foot rest. The side compartments are divided into upper and lower registers, each with three figures. There are twelve figures in total on the upper and lower register on either side on Christ, which represents the twelve apostles. In the bottom right register there is a figure of Judas who is hanged. The image of the dead figure with a devil eating his vitals is a symbol of remorse.

<text>Taüll () is a town in the province of Lleida, in Catalonia, Spain. It is home to the church of Sant Climent de Taüll, an excellent example of Romanesque architecture, one of the Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Taüll is one of the villages of the municipality of Vall de Boí in the comarca of Alta Ribagorça.

== Etymology ==
According to Catalan linguist Joan Coromines, the name Taüll comes from the Ibero-Basque roots &quot;(a) ta-uri&quot; &gt; &quot;(a) ta-uli&quot;: &quot;the village of the (mountain&#x27;s) door&quot;.

== Location ==
It is located at the bottom of Vall de Boí. The town as of 2008 had 270 inhabitants. In order to get to Taüll, from the city of Lleida take the N-230 road, that begins in Lleida and finishes in Vielha. The N-230 goes through the village of Pont de Suert. At the end of the village turn right to take the L-500, the main road of the Valley of Boí. Continue on this road after leave behind Barruera until another fork. Turn to the right at L-501, reaching the settlements of Boí and Taüll and finishing at the ski resort of Boí-Taüll.

== History ==

In 806 the Count of Toulouse freed the region from the Muslim domination and from the tribute they had to pay. Later, the Valley of Boí was given to the county of Pallars, dependent on the Church of Urgell.

In 911, after a serious conflict with the Church of Urgell, a diocese was established which included the counties of Pallars and Ribagorça.

In 949, both counties separated: Ribagorça remained in the new bishopric while Pallars came back again under the Church of Urgell. Further juridic conflicts made both counties join again and until the early 12th century the region didn&#x27;t have any sort of stability. It was at this time when the region was favored by Alfons I &quot;El Batallador&quot;, due to the direct participation of the region&#x27;s lords in his reconquest campaign, finally reaching a stable and prosperous period. The lords of Erill had the villages of Taüll and Boí under their jurisdiction, whose amassed wealth allowed all the rustic churches in the valley to be renewed, building the churches of Sant Climent, Sant Martí (destroyed by an avalanche in the 1970s) and Santa Maria, featuring a richly decorated Romanesque architecture with outstanding liturgical furniture.

The lords of Erill were a very important barony in the Pyrenees. They are known because of the planning and construction of the churches in the Valley of Boí. The valley was dominated by the Erills, whose castle is in the nowadays abandoned village of Erillcastell. The name of Taüll means ATA-ULI (&quot;the peak of the village&quot;).

== Economy ==
Taüll&#x27;s economy is based on summer and winter tourism, aside from its aforementioned Romanesque heritage, the town also has a variety of hotels, restaurants and guided hikes. Livestock, the traditional economic activity of the village, is still active.

== Geography ==
Located at an altitude of 1,520 meters in the Sant Martí valley, a small valley in the Valley of Boí. The closest river is the Sant Martí river, Noguera de Tor affluent. A ravine splits the village in two districts: La Guinsa and Lo Barri. La Guinsa goes from the entrance of the village to the ravine, and Lo Barri goes from the ravine to the high part of the village.

<text>Ciro&#x27;s (later known as Ciro&#x27;s Le Disc) was a nightclub on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California owned by William Wilkerson. Opened in 1940, Ciro&#x27;s became a popular nightspot for celebrities. The nightclub closed in 1960 and was reopened as a rock club in 1965. After a few name changes, it eventually became The Comedy Store in 1972.

== History ==
Club Seville opened New Year&#x27;s Eve 1935. It featured a &quot;crystal dance floor with subsurface fish, fountains and colored lights in its Crystal Marine Room.&quot;

The building was remodeled, and, in January 1940, Ciro&#x27;s was opened by entrepreneur William Wilkerson at 8433 Sunset Boulevard. In 1934, Wilkerson had also opened Cafe Trocadero, and the restaurant La Rue, both on the Strip, and would later originate The Flamingo in Las Vegas, only to have control of the resort wrested from him by mobster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel.

In November 1942, Wilkerson leased Ciro&#x27;s to his longtime right-hand man Herman Hover, who would make sure Ciro&#x27;s was an important Hollywood hotspot until 1959. 

Ciro&#x27;s combined a luxe baroque interior and an unadorned exterior and became a famous hangout for movie people of the 1940s and 1950s. It was one of the places to be seen and guaranteed being written about in the gossip columns of Hedda Hopper, Louella Parsons, and Florabel Muir. On April 8, 1947, Frank Sinatra slugged &quot;one of the most abusive&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thenation/sinatra-his-way&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst gossip columnists, Lee Mortimer, outside Ciro&#x27;s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo/FBI/Sinatra&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the galaxy of celebrities who frequented Ciro&#x27;s were Marilyn Monroe,&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/169737431&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, Frank Sinatra,&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/Ciros-Angeles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; James Dean, Ava Gardner, Sidney Poitier, Anita Ekberg, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, Spencer Tracy, Joan Crawford, Betty Grable, Marlene Dietrich, Clark Gable, Ginger Rogers, Ronald Reagan, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Mickey Rooney, Cary Grant, George Raft, George Burns and Gracie Allen, Judy Garland, June Allyson and Dick Powell, Mamie Van Doren, Jimmy Stewart, Jack Benny, Peter Lawford, and Lana Turner (who often said Ciro&#x27;s was her favorite nightspot) among many others. During his first visit to Hollywood in the late 1940s, future President John F. Kennedy dined at Ciro&#x27;s.

In December 1951, Herman Hover, owner of Ciro&#x27;s, was involved with the Lili St. Cyr″s indecent exposure case. She was defended by Jerry Geisler. She was accompanied by Armando Orsini, her husband.

Herman Hover filed for bankruptcy in 1959, and Ciro&#x27;s was sold at public auction for $350,000.

In 1965, Ciro&#x27;s reopened as the rock club Ciro&#x27;s Le Disc. Ike &amp; Tina Turner performed at the newly opened club with Jimi Hendrix as part of their band. The Byrds got their start at Ciro&#x27;s Le Disc in 1965. Accounts of the period (reproduced in the sleeve notes to &quot;The Preflyte Sessions&quot; box set) describe a &quot;church-like&quot; atmosphere, with interpretive dancing. The club also served as the host during the recording of the 1965 Dick Dale album &quot;Rock Out With Dick Dale &amp; His Del-Tones: Live At Ciro&#x27;s&quot;. Two years later, it was renamed The Kaleidoscope. In 1968, the club was called It&#x27;s Boss. In 1969, it was known as Patch 2. The site of Ciro&#x27;s became The Comedy Store in 1972.

==Notable performers==
== Ciro&#x27;s club and restaurant chain==
The name Ciro&#x27;s comes from Italian-born Egyptian Ciro Capozzi who founded the first Ciro&#x27;s bar in Monaco around 1892,&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/501459070&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; next to the café Riche in the newly built Galerie Charles III. According to the story of James Gordon Bennett Jr., having a difference about a table on the terrasse, he bought the café Riche and gave it to Ciro who named it the Ciro&#x27;s.&lt;ref name=&quot;vintagemenuart/ciro-paris-1923&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, Ciro Capozzi sold the name to an English consortium (including William Poulett, 7th Earl Poulett as main investor, and Clément Hobson&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/501459015&quot;&gt;
* 
&lt;/ref&gt;) who open the Deauville Ciro&#x27;s (still existing as a restaurant belonging to the Groupe Lucien Barrière), the Paris Ciro&#x27;s in 1912,&lt;ref name=&quot;agefotostock/MEV-10529167&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jazzageclub/370&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the London one in 1915. Ciro&#x27;s became a European high society restaurant chain with branches in Monte Carlo,&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/501459083&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Paris, London&lt;ref name=&quot;alamy/Ciros/London&quot;&gt;
*
&lt;/ref&gt; (where Audrey Hepburn danced before her film career), and Deauville. Bartender Harry MacElhone, famous for Harry&#x27;s New York Bar, first worked at Ciro&#x27;s in London after World War I.

&quot;Ciro&#x27;s was a hip London establishment (before another popular one opened up in Los Angeles in 1940), that had as their bartender Harry McElhone (author of ABC of Cocktails), at which Jimmy took over when Harry went off to Paris. ...&quot; (Ross Bolton)

&quot;Louis Adlon, grandson of the proprietor of Berlin’s Hotel Adlon opened Hollywood’s first iteration of Ciro’s in 1934 (with Erich Alexander and George Sorel) Located on Hollywood Boulevard, the club was informally part of a chain with locations in London, Paris and Berlin. The Hollywood Ciro’s was not a success, apparently, because it soon folded.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;playgroundtothestars/ciros-opens&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;...At one point in the late 1930s there were wildcat Ciro&#x27;s operating in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami Beach (designed by George Farkas), Honolulu, Acapulco, Mexico City, and a host of other places...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oxR-booze/ciros&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Oil paint is a type of slow-drying paint that consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. Oil paint also has practical advantages over other paints, mainly because it is waterproof. 

The earliest surviving examples of oil paint have been found in Asia from as early as the 7th century AD, in examples of Buddhist paintings in Afghanistan. Oil-based paints made their way to Europe by the 12th century and were used for simple decoration, mostly on wood, but oil painting did not begin to be adopted as an artistic medium there until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. The thickness of the coat has considerable bearing on the time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.

The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. The addition of oil or alkyd medium can also be used to modify the viscosity and drying time of oil paint.

==History==

The technical history of the introduction and development of oil paint, and the date of introduction of various additives (driers, thinners) is still — despite intense research since the mid-19th century - not well understood. Incorrect theories and information are common, especially in sources written before 1952. Until 1991 nothing was known about the organic aspect of cave paintings from the Paleolithic era. Many assumptions were made about the &quot;chemistry&quot; of the binders. Well-known Dutch-American artist Willem de Kooning is known for saying &quot;Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented&quot;.

===First recorded use===
The oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created . The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the cliffs of Afghanistan&#x27;s Bamiyan Valley, &quot;using walnut, poppy seed oils, Linseed oil and castor oil.&quot; In some regions, this technique is referred to as the drying oil technique.

===Classical and medieval period===
Though the ancient Mediterranean civilizations of Greece, Rome, and Egypt used vegetable oils, there is little evidence to indicate their use as media in painting. Indeed, linseed oil was not used as a medium because of its tendency to dry very slowly, darken, and crack, unlike mastic and wax (the latter of which was used in encaustic painting).

Greek writers such as Aetius Amidenus recorded recipes involving the use of oils for drying, such as walnut, poppy, hempseed, pine nut, castor, and linseed. When thickened, the oils became resinous and could be used as varnish to seal and protect paintings from water. Additionally, when yellow pigment was added to oil, it could be spread over tin foil as a less expensive alternative to gold leaf.

Christian monks were aware of these ancient books and used the techniques in their own artworks. Theophilus Presbyter, a 12th-century German monk, recommended linseed oil but advocated against the use of olive oil due to its long drying time. Oil paint was mainly used as it is today in house decoration, as a tough waterproof cover for exposed woodwork, especially outdoors.

In the 13th century, oil was used to detail tempera paintings. In the 14th century, Cennino Cennini described a painting technique utilizing tempera painting covered by light layers of oil. The slow-drying properties of organic oils were commonly known to early painters. However, the difficulty in acquiring and working the materials meant that they were rarely used (and indeed the slow drying was seen as a disadvantage).

===Renaissance onwards===
As the public preference for naturalism increased, the quick-drying tempera paints became insufficient to achieve the very detailed and precise effects that oil could achieve. The Early Netherlandish painting of the 15th century saw the rise of panel painting purely in oils, or oil painting, or works combining tempera and oil painting, and by the 16th-century easel painting in pure oils had become the norm. The claim by Vasari that Jan van Eyck &quot;invented&quot; oil painting is not correct, but van Eyck&#x27;s &quot;use&quot; of oil paint achieved novel results in terms of precise detail and mixing colors wet-on-wet. Van Eyck&#x27;s mixture may have consisted of piled glass, calcined bones, and mineral pigments boiled in linseed oil until they reached a viscous state—or he may have simply used sun-thickened oils (slightly oxidized by Sun exposure).

The Flemish-trained or influenced Antonello da Messina, whom Vasari wrongly credited with the introduction of oil paint to Italy, does seem to have improved the formula by adding litharge, or lead (II) oxide. The new mixture had a honey-like consistency and better drying properties (drying evenly without cracking). This mixture was known as &quot;oglio cotto&quot;—&quot;cooked oil.&quot; Leonardo da Vinci later improved these techniques by cooking the mixture at a very low temperature and adding 5 to 10% beeswax, which prevented the darkening of the paint. Giorgione, Titian, and Tintoretto each may have altered this recipe for their own purposes.

===Paint tube===

The paint tube was invented in 1841 by the portrait painter John Goffe Rand, superseding pig bladders and glass syringes as the primary tool of paint transport. Artists, or their assistants, previously ground each pigment by hand, carefully mixing the binding oil in the proper proportions. Paints could now be produced in bulk and sold in tin tubes with a cap. The cap could be screwed back on and the paints preserved for future use, providing flexibility and efficiency to painting outdoors. The manufactured paints had a balanced consistency that the artist could thin with oil, turpentine, or other mediums.

Paint in tubes also changed the way some artists approached painting. The artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir said, &quot;Without tubes of paint, there would have been no impressionism.&quot; For the impressionists, tubed paints offered an easily accessible variety of colors for their plein air palettes, motivating them to make spontaneous color choices.

==Carrier==
===Characteristics===
Traditional oil paints require an oil that always hardens, forming a stable, impermeable film. Such oils are called causative, or drying, oils, and are characterized by high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids. One common measure of the causative property of oils is iodine number, the number of grams of iodine one hundred grams of oil can absorb. Oils with an iodine number greater than 130 are considered drying, those with an iodine number of 115–130 are semi-drying, and those with an iodine number of less than 115 are non-drying. Linseed oil, the most prevalent vehicle for artists&#x27; oil paints, is a drying oil.

When exposed to air, oils do not undergo an evaporation process like water does. Instead, they dry semisolid by oxidation causing polymerization. The rate of this process can be very slow, depending on the oil.

The advantage of the slow-drying quality of oil paint is that an artist can develop a painting gradually. Earlier media such as egg tempera dried quickly, which prevented the artist from making changes or corrections. With oil-based paints, revising was comparatively easy. The disadvantage is that a painting might take months or years to finish, which might disappoint an anxious patron. Oil paints blend well with each other, making subtle variations of color possible as well as creating many details of light and shadow. Oil paints can be diluted with turpentine or other thinning agents, which artists take advantage of to paint in layers.

There is also another kind of oil paint that is water-mixable, making the cleaning and using process easier and less toxic.

===Sources===

The earliest and still most commonly used vehicle is linseed oil, pressed from the seed of the flax plant. Modern processes use heat or steam to produce refined varieties of oil with fewer impurities, but many artists prefer cold-pressed oils. Other vegetable oils such as hemp, poppy seed, walnut, sunflower, safflower, and soybean oils may be used as alternatives to linseed oil for a variety of reasons. For example, safflower and poppy oils are paler than linseed oil and allow for more vibrant whites straight from the tube.

===Extraction methods and processing===
Once the oil is extracted, additives such as Liquin are sometimes used to modify its chemical properties. In this way, the paint can be made to dry more quickly (if that is desired), or to have varying levels of gloss. Modern oils paints can, therefore, have complex chemical structures; for example, affecting resistance to UV. By hand, the process involves first mixing the paint pigment with the linseed oil to a crumbly mass on a glass or marble slab. Then, a small amount at a time is ground between the slab and a glass muller (a round, flat-bottomed glass instrument with a handgrip). Pigment and oil are ground together &#x27;with patience&#x27; until a smooth, ultra-fine paste is achieved. This paste is then placed into jars or metal paint tubes and labeled. Modern industrial production uses mill rollers to grind pigment and oil together into a paste.

==Pigment==
The color of oil paint is derived from small particles of colored pigments mixed with the carrier, the oil. Common pigment types include mineral salts such as white oxides: zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and the red to yellow cadmium pigments. Another class consists of earth types, the main ones being ochre, sienna and umber. Still another group of pigments comes from living organisms, such as madder root. Synthetic Organic and inorganic pigments have been introduced since the nineteenth century. Natural pigments have the advantage of being well understood through centuries of use, but synthetics have greatly increased the spectrum of available colors, and many have a high level of lightfastness.

When oil paint was first introduced in the arts, basically the same limited range of available pigments were used that had already been applied in tempera: yellow ochre, umber, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, kermes, azurite, ultramarine, verdigris, lamp black and lead white. These pigments strongly varied in price, transparency, and lightfastness. They included both inorganic and organic substances, the latter often being far less permanent. The painter bought them from specialized traders, &quot;color men&quot;, and let his apprentices grind them with oil in his studio to obtain paint of the desired viscosity.

During the Age of Discovery, new pigments became known in Europe, most of the organic and earthy type, such as Indian yellow. In the eighteenth century, the developing science of chemistry expanded the range of pigments, which led to the discovery of Prussian blue and cobalt blue. In the nineteenth century, synthetic ultramarine was introduced, zinc white, viridian, chrome yellow, cadmium colours, aureolin, synthetic alizarin and cerulean blue. In the twentieth century, mass production started of titanium white and a new range of lightfast synthetic organic pigments, such as arylide yellow, phthalocyanine and quinacridone. Though having mainly an industrial application, these pigments by the twenty-first century had largely replaced traditional types in artistic oil paint also.

===Toxicity===

Many of the historical pigments were dangerous, and many pigments still in use are highly toxic. Some of the most poisonous pigments, such as Paris green (copper(II) acetoarsenite) and orpiment (arsenic sulfide), have fallen from use.

Many pigments are toxic to some degree. Commonly used reds and yellows are produced using cadmium, and vermilion red uses natural or synthetic mercuric sulfide or cinnabar. Flake white and Cremnitz white are made with basic lead carbonate. Some intense blue colors, including cobalt blue and cerulean blue, are made with cobalt compounds. Some varieties of cobalt violet are made with cobalt arsenate.

<text>HMS &quot;Llandaff&quot; was a or Type 61 aircraft direction frigate of the British Royal Navy, named after the district of Llandaff in Cardiff, Wales. She was built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company at Hebburn on the River Tyne, being laid down on 27 August 1953 and launched on 30 November 1955.

==Construction==
&quot;Llandaff&quot; was one of three &quot;Salisbury&quot;-class frigates ordered on 28 June 1951 as a follow-on to the name ship of the class. She was laid down at Hawthorn Leslie&#x27;s Hebburn shipyard on 27 August 1953, She was launched by Countess Mountbatten, the wife of Earl Louis Mounbatten, on 30 November 1955. &quot;Llandaff&quot; broke away from her moorings in a storm on 1 March 1956 and was damaged by collisions with the cruiser , the frigate and a merchant ship before she could be brought under control. Despite this damage, she completed and was accepted into service on 11 April 1958.

==Royal Navy service==
On entry to service &quot;Llandaff&quot; was the first ship to be trained by the newly established Flag Officer Sea Training organisation at Portland.

She re-commissioned for the 5th time at Singapore in 1967 and returned to UK waters in September 1968, completing the commission at Devonport in 1970.

Between June and September 1968, &quot;Llandaff&quot; was in transit from Singapore to the United Kingdom. Her trip home was a &#x27;showing the flag&#x27; voyage via the Solomon Islands, Cairns (Australia), Auckland (New Zealand), Fiji, Rotuma, the Gilbert Islands, Honolulu (Pearl Harbor), Monterey (USA), Long Beach for refuelling, transit through the Panama Canal then Barbados with a short stop in Azores for refuelling, then home to Devonport.

==Bangladesh Navy service==

&quot;Llandaff&quot; was sold to the Bangladeshi Navy on 10 December 1976 and was renamed &quot;Umar Farooq&quot;. &quot;Umar Farooq&quot; was converted into a training ship where officers under-training and sailors get sea time. During her long refit, a female officers&#x27; gunroom and heads were installed so that female officers under-training can also be accommodated. In the Bangladesh Navy she undertook flag-showing and training visits abroad, notable among them the goodwill visit to India, Pakistan and Maldives in 1989, participation in the Korean International Fleet Review in 1998 and the 2014 search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. With three other frigates she formed the 7th Frigate Squadron and was stationed in Chittagong, Bangladesh. In 2016 she was sold for scrapping.

<text>Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released in March 1999 by record labels Murmur and Epic. The songs &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot;, &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; and &quot;Miss You Love&quot; were released as singles and a short film was released for the song &quot;Emotion Sickness&quot;. &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the Australian albums chart and peaked at No. 50 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. It was also their most successful album on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 29. The album was nominated for 10 ARIA Awards and was certified Triple Platinum by the ARIA for selling over 210,000 copies in Australia. The album has been described as &quot;heavy rock with orchestral flourishes and synthetic touches with powerfully emotional lyrics&quot; that reflects the personal demons of frontman Daniel Johns due to the band&#x27;s rapid international success.

== Background, writing and recording ==
From May 1998, Silverchair worked on their third studio album, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, with Nick Launay (Midnight Oil, Models, The Birthday Party) producing again. The band had originally intended to take a 12-month-break after the release of 1997&#x27;s &quot;Freak Show&quot;, but instead chose to devote their time to making new music.

In 1999, Johns announced that he had developed the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, due to anxiety. Johns noted that the lyrics to &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; dealt with his disorder (&quot;And Ana wrecks your life/like an anorexia life&quot;), where he would &quot;eat what he needed [...] to stay awake.&quot; In June 2004, he revealed that his eating problems developed from the time of &quot;Freak Show&quot; and when &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was written he &quot;hated music, really everything about it&quot;, but felt that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stop doing it; I felt like a slave to it.&quot; Johns sought therapy and medication but felt &quot;It&#x27;s easier for me to express it through music and lyrics&quot;.

Johns said the album was approached differently compared to the band&#x27;s previous records: &quot;The first two albums were written with the music being second to something else – like school, and everything else that teenagers go through. My mind was on many things, and music was just one of them. On this album, music was the only thing I was doing and the only thing that I had to concentrate on. I approached it differently in that all of the songs were written as poetry. In three months I wrote about 112 poems, and I made a collage out of the poems, and turned the words that meant the most to me into songs. Then I wrote the music around words, rather than writing the words around the music.&quot;

In June 1999, drummer Ben Gillies said about the writing process, &quot;In our year off, [Johns] turned into a hermit, we didn&#x27;t see him that much. Me and Chris were keeping normal hours, and surfing and hanging out with mates. I didn&#x27;t really think about the writing, I was just thinking about having a good time. I did have a hand in two songs, though &quot;Spawn Again&quot; which was actually for the movie &quot;Spawn&quot;, and &quot;Trash&quot; which is kind of heavy, a fast, punky one, but it didn&#x27;t make the album, I am going to try and be more involved with the writing on the next album. This time I was just lapping up the great atmosphere here in Newcastle.&quot; Gillies, however, would not end up contributing to the songwriting on the band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Diorama&quot; (2002), with Johns writing all of the songs.

== Content ==
&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was an overhaul of the band&#x27;s musical style found on their first two albums, &quot;Frogstomp&quot; (1995) and &quot;Freak Show&quot; (1997). &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot;, for example, retained much of the band&#x27;s youthful rock energy, but featured a new rock song structure and various electronic effects. In March 2007, Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns said: &quot;To me, I honestly feel like our first record was &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;. I&#x27;ve never felt any different. I don&#x27;t feel like our first two albums were Silverchair: that&#x27;s our teenage high school band. I don&#x27;t like them at all. I listen to them and go, &#x27;That&#x27;s cute&#x27;, especially the first one, because &quot;Frogstomp&quot; we were 14. But the second one we&#x27;re like 16, I&#x27;m like &#x27;You&#x27;re getting older. You&#x27;re running out of chances&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Spawn Again&quot; dates back to 1996 and was originally considered for the band&#x27;s &quot;Freak Show&quot; album. It was recorded under the original title &quot;Spawn&quot; when demoing tracks for &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; and included, in a remixed form by hip-hop group Vitro on the 1997 soundtrack to the film &quot;Spawn&quot;, adding various electronic elements to the track. A &quot;Pre-Vitro&quot; mix of the same recording was also released on the &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; Limited Edition bonus disc, &quot;Volume 1&quot; in 2000, and the &quot;Rarities 1994–1999&quot; compilation in 2002. The &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; album version of the song is a complete re-recording, re-titled &quot;Spawn Again&quot;, featuring additional lyrics, specifically an entire verse adding to the animal liberation narrative. The album recording of &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot; is a different mix on the Australian release than the one found on other releases (including singles). &quot;Satin Sheets&quot; was originally called &quot;Punk Song #3&quot; (and was a contender for &quot;Freak Show&quot;) and &quot;Paint Pastel Princess&quot; was &quot;All the Same to Me&quot;.

Johns wrote all the songs on the album except &quot;Spawn Again&quot; which he co-wrote with Gillies.

== Release ==
&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was released on 8 March 1999 on Sony Records imprint Murmur. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and was certified 4× platinum by ARIA. It was also certified Gold in the United States. &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; outsold &quot;Freak Show&quot; in North America and throughout the world. To date it has sold a total of 2 million albums worldwide. The album charted in Canada, where it peaked at No. 5. It reached the top 40 on the United Kingdom Albums Chart.

The album has also been issued in gatefold cover vinyl, limited edition cassette and 180 gram vinyl in 2010, as well as in a double pack with &quot;Freak Show&quot;. On initial release in the UK, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was issued as a limited edition with a bonus enhanced CD (see track listing).

&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; provided three Australian top 20 singles: &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot;, &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; and &quot;Miss You Love&quot;; a fourth single, &quot;Paint Pastel Princess&quot;, did not reach the top 50. &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot; peaked at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Modern Rock Tracks. A vinyl version of the album was limited to 5,000 copies worldwide. In Europe and South America it became the group&#x27;s most successful album to date. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Neva Chonin attributed their chart success to the album&#x27;s more &quot;mature&quot; sound.

After the release of &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, Silverchair&#x27;s three-album contract with Sony Music ended. The group eventually signed with Atlantic Records for North and South America, and formed their own label, (distributed by EMI), with their manager, John Watson for Australia and Asia.

&quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on 12 October 1999.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Electric Music Online&quot;, who gave it a score of 91%, wrote a highly positive review of the album, and picked &quot;Satin Sheets&quot; and &quot;Miss You Love&quot; as the record&#x27;s best songs.

&quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; writer Marc Weinroth heavily praised Silverchair&#x27;s ballads on &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, as well as the use of an orchestra on many of the album&#x27;s songs.

Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane said &quot;as well as being the band&#x27;s best album to date, it was universally acknowledged as one of the best albums of the year.&quot;

German music magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; gave the album a positive score of 8.5 out of 10.

==Legacy==
In October 2010, &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was listed at number 25 in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

In July 2011, music website &quot;Concrete Playground&quot; ranked &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; the 27th best Australian album. In September 2018, Australian radio station Double J ranked the album number 7 on its ranking of &quot;The 50 Best Australian Albums of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

In January 2019, American online magazine &quot;Loudwire&quot; included &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; on their &quot;15 Best Hard Rock Albums of 1999&quot;. In April 2019, &quot;Loudwire&quot; listed two songs from the album, &quot;Anthem for the Year 2000&quot; and &quot;Ana&#x27;s Song (Open Fire)&quot;, on its &quot;50 Rock Songs That Defined 1999&quot;.

In May 2019, David James Young of Australian website Junkee wrote that Silverchair &quot;rarely felt more alive than on &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s not the sound of a band aping its heroes — it&#x27;s the sound of a band shedding its skin; an ugly but nonetheless necessary process of evolution&quot;. Young also complimented Silverchair&#x27;s use of an orchestra on the album, as it &quot;feels vital to these moments on the record, adding further dramatic tension to a record that&#x27;s already thriving off of it.&quot; About the mixed reception it received from some critics, Young wrote: &quot;With 20 years of hindsight, however — not to mention eight full years of Silverchair being spoken of in the past tense — there&#x27;s a chance for those that may not have understood exactly where &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; was coming from to reevaluate it under a new light. Consider that, when a lot of the criticisms were made about &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot;, it was from the viewpoint of being the most recent studio album for a still-active band.&quot;

In July 2020, British magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; listed &quot;Neon Ballroom&quot; at number 32 on their list of &quot;The 50 Best Albums from 1999&quot;.

== Touring ==
Silverchair added an auxiliary keyboardist, Sam Holloway (ex-Cordrazine), for the Neon Ballroom Tour. The US leg had the group playing with The Offspring and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Silverchair&#x27;s tour of UK and the rest of Europe had The Living End as the support act. The group appeared at festivals in Reading and Edgefest, amongst others.

Following the tour, the band announced that they would be taking a 12-month-break. Their only live performance in 2000 was at the Falls Festival on New Year&#x27;s Eve. On 21 January 2001, the band played to 250,000 people at Rock in Rio, a show they described as the highlight of their career.

<text>Gower Gulch is a nickname for the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.

== History ==

Since the days of silent film, the surrounding area had contained several movie studios, including the Christie Studios (on the northwest corner) during the 1920s, then later, Columbia and Republic Studios to the south along Gower Street.

Western films at both studios were extremely popular, especially from the 1930s through the 1950s, and actual working cowboys would come to Hollywood hoping to find work in the movies. They would congregate at that particular street corner, which is how it acquired its nickname. The Columbia Drug Store, which stood on the southeast corner for several decades, was a hangout for many western film extras in hopes of finding work, knowing the casting agents from the studio could reach them there. John Wayne, Gene Autry, and Roy Rogers all got their start in this neighborhood, as did director John Ford. Columbia Studios was filming western films about every ten days for a time. The cowboy extras stood at the corner already dressed in their Stetson hats, boots, and bandannas, ready for saloon scenes, as cattle rustlers, or as members of a posse. The pay was about $5 a day or $10 for a minor speaking role.

Charlie Chaplin made some of his first movies in this area.

In February 1940, actor Jerome Bonaparte &quot;Blackjack&quot; Ward became involved in a homicide on Sunset Boulevard at Gower Gulch, near Columbia Pictures studios when he shot and killed stuntman and background actor Johnny Tyke.

A strip mall, &quot;Gower Gulch Plaza&quot;, &quot;paying homage to the past&quot; and designed in the style of an Old West backlot was built in 1976 on the southwest corner of Sunset and Gower. The name &quot;Gower Gulch&quot; is painted on the side of a vintage western medicine show wagon. The strip mall remains unchanged as of 2024 and has been described as &quot;Old West kitsch&quot;.

==In pop culture==
*In the Warner Bros. 1943 movie &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars,&quot; Gower Gulch is a hilltop neighborhood in Los Angeles, where struggling actors and musicians live in caravans and cottages cobbled together from movie sets and gathered around an old house. It is located &quot;only 4 minutes from Vine Street,&quot; according to one of the characters. The Hollywoodland sign blinks in the background on its distant hill. 
*A B-movie was released in 1950 called &quot;The Kid from Gower Gulch&quot; starring Spade Cooley. In the film, singer Red Murrell sings a song called &quot;Gower Gulch is Home Sweet Home&quot;.
*The November 13, 1948, episode of the CBS West Coast radio detective series &quot;Jeff Regan, Private Investigator&quot; is entitled &quot;The Guy from Gower Gulch&quot;; its plot revolves around a missing South American racehorse and its connections to a travelogue.
*The name Gower Gulch also appears in the Warner Bros. 1950 cartoon &quot;All a Bir-r-r-rd&quot;. It is the name of a western-looking town Tweety&#x27;s train passes through. 
*In another Warner Bros. 1951 cartoon, &quot;Drip-Along Daffy&quot;, Porky Pig sings a Michael Maltese-written song entitled &quot;The Flower of Gower Gulch&quot;. Another version of the song is performed in the Warner Bros. animated short &quot;Nelly&#x27;s Folly&quot;.
*In the 1942 Abbott and Costello film &quot;Ride &#x27;Em Cowboy&quot; a bus depot is identified as Gower Gulch by a hanging sign.
* In the biopic Mank, &quot;Gower Gulch&quot; is referenced at 34&#x27; 07&quot; in the MGM offices.

<text>The Maurice River () is a tributary of Delaware Bay in Salem County and Cumberland County, New Jersey in the United States. The river was named for Maurice, Prince of Orange.

==Watershed and course==
The Maurice River, pronounced &quot;MAW-ris&quot;, is approximately long with a drainage area of 386 square miles (1,000 km2). It is the second longest and second largest tributary to Delaware Bay. Its watershed includes an extensive southern portion of the coastal forested wetlands known as the Pine Barrens. Its mouth on Delaware Bay is surrounded by extensive salt marshes and has provided a historically important oystering ground.

It is born at the confluence of Still Run and Scotland Run, beneath the waters of Willow Grove Lake in Pittsgrove, Salem County and flows generally south-southeast, passing west of Vineland. At Millville it is impounded to form the Union Lake reservoir, approximately long. South of Millville it becomes navigable, forming a estuary that empties into Maurice River Cove on Delaware Bay. The estuary is joined from the northeast by Menantico Creek, the Manumuskin River, and Muskee Creek.

==Water quality and stewardship==
The river is considered especially pristine for the region, forming a critical ecological link between the Pine Barrens and the Delaware Bay systems, except that the State of New Jersey advises against eating more than of fish caught in the river in any week or month, depending on the species, for the general population and advises against eating any fish from the Maurice River for the High Risk population. It is the location of one of the few stands of wild rice in New Jersey, and provides habitat for 53 percent of the species in New Jersey designated as endangered. In 1993, Congress designated of the river and its tributaries as the Maurice National Scenic and Recreational River, as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers program.

A local nonprofit organization, Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc., is a regional watershed organization that focuses its work on the Maurice River watershed, from Willow Grove Lake southward. The South Jersey Land and Water Trust focuses on the northern portion of the watershed, from Willow Grove Lake northward.

<text>Grand admiral is a historic naval rank, the highest rank in the several European navies that used it. It is best known for its use in Germany as . A comparable rank in modern navies is that of admiral of the fleet.

==Grand admirals in individual navies==

===Austria-Hungary===
The Austrian grand admirals were all members of the Imperial family, except for , the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy for part of World War I:

===France===
In Bourbon Restoration France, the rank was an honorific one equivalent to that of marshal in the French Army.

===Germany===

In the Imperial German Navy, and later in the , the rank &quot;Großadmiral&quot; was the equivalent of a British admiral of the fleet or a United States fleet admiral; as a five-star rank (OF-10). Its holders were authorised to carry a baton.

The rank was created in 1901 and discontinued in 1945, by which time a total of eight men had been promoted to it. The next most junior rank was (admiral-general).

<doc id="668982" wikidata="Q16842504" url="?curid=668982" title="Hepburn (surname)">
<text>Hepburn is a family name of the Anglo-Scottish border, that is associated with a variety of notable people, eponyms, places, and things. Although commonly a Scottish name, its origins lie to the south of the border in the north of England. Specifically, the name is thought to have derived from Hepburn or Hebron in Northumberland or Hebburn in Tyne and Wear. The origins of the name are suggested to be the same as that of Hebborne from the Old English words &quot;heah&quot; (&quot;high&quot;) and &quot;byrgen&quot; (&quot;burial mound&quot;). Alternatively it could mean something along the lines of &quot;high place beside the water&quot;, as the word &quot;burn&quot; is a still widely used in Northumbrian and Scots for &quot;stream&quot;.

Next to Chillingham Castle there remains a bastle tower where the family originated. This was the seat of a line of the family until the eighteenth century when that branch died out, having left only a female heir. However, it is as the Earls of Bothwell that the Hepburn family are perhaps best remembered. This branch of the family originated in Lothian when a Hepburn was granted land having saved the Earl of March from a horse that had lost control. This family first became the Lords of Hailes before being granted the Earldom of Bothwell.

There were also Hepburns of Waughton, thought by some to have branched off from the Hailes line, thought by others to predate it. Another line was the Hepburns of Beanston, and yet another was the Hepburns of Athelstaneford. All of these families were prominent in various ways at various junctures of Scottish history, but all were primarily located around the East Lothian area.

<doc id="668984" wikidata="Q4570201" url="?curid=668984" title="Ginling College">
<text>Ginling College (), also known by its pinyin romanization as Jinling College or Jinling Women&#x27;s College, is a women&#x27;s college of Nanjing Normal University in Nanjing, China. It offers both bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. It offers six undergraduate majors: applied English, accounting, financial management, labor and social welfare, food science and engineering, and food quality and safety. Master&#x27;s degrees are offered in food science, agricultural products processing, and storage, and women&#x27;s education.

Ginling College traces its roots to the Christian college of the same name founded in 1913, which started operations in 1915 and was the first institution to grant bachelor&#x27;s degrees to female students in China. The school was closed from 1951 to 1987, when it was reestablished on its previous site.

American architect and art historian Talbot Hamlin designed some of the buildings that were constructed in the 1919 to 1925 period.

Wu Yi-Fang, who was one of Ginling&#x27;s first five graduates and earned a doctorate degree from the University of Michigan in 1928, became the first Chinese woman to head a college in China, heading Jinling College from 1928-51 until it merged with the University of Nanking in 1951. Wu, who became a powerful figure in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as a patriotic woman educator, worked tirelessly to reopen the school. However, it did not ultimately reopen until 1987, two years after her death.

During the Nanjing Massacre, the college, led by its acting principal Minnie Vautrin, harbored over 10,000 women trying to hide from the Japanese Imperial Army.

==History==

=== Establishment (1913~1915) ===
Ginling College was founded in 1913 against the backdrop of the Social Gospel Movement and the Student Volunteer Movement in the United States, and the increasing demand for women&#x27;s education propelled by the Chinese Revolution of 1911. Through the efforts of a united board composed of eight American mission boards—Baptists (North and South), Disciples, Episcopalians, Methodists (North and South), and Presbyterians (North and South)—Ginling College officially opened in 1915 with six faculty and eleven students. All subjects were taught in English except for the Chinese classics. The first graduating class, consisting of five women, including future Gingling College President Wu Yifang, graduated in 1919. They became the first women in China to receive fully accredited Bachelor of Arts degrees. Matilda Thurston, a Mount Holyoke graduate who had previously been with the Yale Mission in Changsha, served as the first president of the college from 1913 to 1928. In August 1928, Wu Yifang—a Ginling graduate—was inaugurated as the next president.

=== During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937~1945) ===
When the war broke out between Imperial Japan and China, the members of the college had to disperse to different parts of China while the Nanjing campus was turned into a refugee camp under the supervision of Minnie Vautrin.
On December 8, 1937, the first 300 women and children were admitted to the Nanjing campus. Nanjing was captured on December 13, marking the beginning of the Nanjing massacre that lasted for more than a month. At its peak, the campus provided a refuge for nearly 10,000 people. Vautrin herself patrolled the campus chasing away soldiers, visited the Japanese Embassy to ask for protection, and organized the sale of rice in mat sheds that had been erected on the college grounds. She also started Bible classes, and with the help of the refugee women, created a list of missing men to present to the Japanese Embassy. The Nanking International Relief Committee supplied food and fuel for the camp. Once the refugee phase of the work became less urgent, Vautrin diverted her attention to education—opening a middle school, a day school, and a nursery school on the Ginling campus, and providing Homecraft course for “destitute women.” In April 1940, she suffered a nervous breakdown and was taken back to the U.S. 
The evacuated students and faculty members started “Ginling centers” as part of other missionary institutions in Shanghai, Wuchang, and Chengdu.
The Ginling center at Wuchang began when Huachung University accepted thirty Ginling students as guest students. As time went on, more faculty joined the unit and taught at least one course which Huachung University was needing. In return, Ginling students were admitted to all the regular departments of the university. As the war developed, Ginling College worked together with Huachung University and Wuchang Y.W.C.A to carry on a dressing station for the wounded soldiers. However, as it became obvious that the next objective of the Japanese army would be to capture Hankou and Wuchang, many students began to leave. By the end of 1937, only a few Ginling members remained.

===Under the Communist Party (1949~1951)===
Under the new Communist government, Ginling&#x27;s curriculum had to incorporate some political requirements. Even though these were not different from the earlier requirement of learning Party Principles under the Nationalist government, Thurston argues that the new Communist requirements were more serious because they contained “more definite challenges to Christian beliefs.” The college life went on very much as before, except for the frequent interruptions in school work for special lectures, parades, and other political functions. Religious activities also continued without any direct opposition from the government. However, as anti-American propaganda began to rise, on November 14, 1950, some students accused their American sociology professor Helen Ferris of spreading anti-revolutionary messages and of attacking the Chinese-Korean alliance. This led to widespread criticisms of not only Ferris, but of “crimes of cultural imperialism” happening in many missionary schools in China. With such hostile atmosphere, all American missionary faculty members left Ginling by spring semester 1951, either by deportation or voluntarily. Some Chinese faculty members who did not completely identify with the aggressive campaign also faced persecution. On December 17, 1950, the U.S. State Department ordered freezing of all Chinese properties in the U.S. and outlawed sending funds to China—making the Smith College’s engagement with Ginling impossible. Without its main source of the budget, Ginling accepted government funding and merged with the University of Nanking to form a public National Jinling University. 
Ginling College reopened in 1987 as part of Nanjing Normal University through the efforts of alumnae and Wu Yifang.

==Academics and Educational Programs==

===1915-1951===
Jin Feng has argued that Ginling’s founders belonged to the group of “modernists” in the mission field who were more interested in preparing elite Chinese women for “Christian leadership,” than in converting the illiterate and poverty-stricken Chinese masses. Even though Ginling was in principle a missionary college, the faculty from the very beginning emphasized the importance of it being a “bona fide institution of higher education” that possessed rigorous academic standards. As a result, curricula taught at Ginling often mimicked the curriculums at elite American women&#x27;s liberal arts colleges in New England. Ginling was especially strong in English, physical education, and home economics.
Ginling had a reputation of strength in English and weakness in Chinese instruction because of its emphasis on English. Almost all courses were given in English, and the school also established an English Comprehensive Test that required all students to pass in the second semester of their second year.
Physical education was designed around the missionary discourse of equating a healthy body with Christian moral character. Physical education including dance instructions at Ginling was what garnered the most attention but also gave it bad publicity. For instance, an incident in 1927 in which a group of Ginling students was found dancing with British naval men outraged the public, as it went against Chinese ideal of propriety and national pride.
The Home Economics Department was established in 1938 in order to meet government regulations during wartime and to strengthen institutional collaboration with other missionary institutions while it was in Chengdu. All Home Economics majors were required to select teaching methodologies for home economics, and starting from the second year, students could choose from three areas as their majors: nutrition, child welfare and development, or art and dress. Even though the program itself the home economics program allowed missionaries to offer science courses to female students. Also, majors in child welfare and development often found themselves studying education in the U.S. after graduation and were able to become teachers in kindergarten and elementary school.

===Today&#x27;s Ginling===
Ginling College currently offers 6 undergraduate majors, 5 master&#x27;s programs, and 4 orientations for master&#x27;s degree candidates. The college has 72 faculty and staff members on the payroll, with 58% of the full-time teachers possessing tenures, 55% holding doctor&#x27;s degrees, and 50% with recent overseas study experience.

==Traditions==

===Student life===
During its early years, the faculty members organized enjoyable group activities with students outside of the classroom setting to create a sense of familiarity and intimacy. These included designated social times with the students, and faculty-led naturalist walks and outings. According to Feng, such attempts at creating solidarity “not only institutionalized a family spirit at Ginling, but also expanded the trope of the family from the institutional to the national level, and thereby cultivated among their students a collective sense of Noblesse oblige toward their nation and people.”
According to the official website, these traditions also came into place under the leadership of President Wu Yifang:

# Chinese and western cultures were integrated. The “Abundant Life” was interpreted as the guiding ideology for cultivating Ginling College students. It required students not only to master their basic and professional knowledge well, but also to have noble dreams. They should be diligent, tough and selfless at their posts and dedicate their lifetime to others, society and nation with their own wisdom and strength.
# Student autonomy and tutorial system were combined to manage students. There was a head teacher for every grade and a tutor for every 8 students. The tutor instructed students’ life and study with skill and patience. There was an instructor in students’ life for each dormitory building.
# The sister-class system was put into practice. Senior “sisters” gave instructions on daily studies and life of junior “sisters” and led them to adapt to the change from a middle school to a college. Therefore, the younger sisters benefited a lot and the elder sisters strengthened their sense of responsibility and pride and thus became stricter with themselves, through which they promoted each other.
# Students&#x27; physical exercise was valued. Every fresher got a health card since she entered college so that teachers could teach students in accordance with their aptitude. The 4-year compulsory PE lessons aimed at improving students’ physique. Students’ musicianship was also valued. The one-year music lessons taught basic knowledge and skills of music like producing sound and reading music. Besides, students could take courses in the Department of Music and participate in the activities held by the chorus or choir to improve their musicianship.
===Academic Year Events===
Founders’ Day was observed every year to celebrate the founders who did pioneer work in the education of women in China. They include: Mary A. Nourse, Sophie Lanneau, Emma A. Lyon, Katherine E. Phelps, Laura E. White, Martha E. Pyle, Mary Cogdal, Venie J. Lee. Founders’ Day was cherished even during exile, as it became a symbol of “unity of spirit” despite the dispersal of Ginling women.

==Architecture==
===The House of a Hundred Rooms (1915~1923)===
Ginling&#x27;s first home was an old-style Chinese residence in Embroidery Alley () known locally as the Garden of the Lis () because it was previously owned by the fifth son of Li Hongzhang, the famous statesman of the Qing dynasty. It consisted of “two large, rambling, Chinese mansions set side by side, each containing four paved courts, set one behind the other, with a fifth court at the side. The buildings were all of gray brick with gray tiles and overhanging caves. Each court had about ten rooms, in most of the rooms delicately latticed windows covered the larger half of the walls. Access to adjoining courts was through moon gates—larger circular openings in the dividing walls.” American faculty members complained of the freezing days of winter, the moldy floors, and walls with cracks. Students also complained about ventilation, heating, and general lack of hygiene. Thurston points out that despite these shortcomings, there was still some beauty to be found, with a beautiful garden with a pavilion laying east of the house.

===New Home===
Since 1916, Thurston had been engaging in negotiations to buy land for a new site of Ginling. However, because it was difficult for women to purchase land at the time, John Leighton Stuart—the president of Nanking Theological Seminary—took over the task. In 1918, he had secured twenty-seven acres of land including eleven ponds, sixty corners, and more than a thousand graves for about US$13,000.
Henry Murphy of Murphy &amp; Dana, a New York architecture firm that had opened an office in Shanghai, was commissioned to design the buildings. He had also designed buildings for Yale-in-China and the Yenching University campus. Thurston insisted on integrating Chinese architectural elements into the new campus. The design for new buildings had a modified Chinese palace-style exterior, with overhanging curved roofs and pointed eaves. At the same time, it was equipped with modern Western conveniences. 
A big part of the funding came from Thurston&#x27;s campaigns in America, especially from the “Seven Oriental Colleges for Women” campaign. Thurston asserted that “it was the cooperative, non-competitive promotion of projects that finally made it appeal to the women of America.”
The academic quadrangle opened on the east, looking directly toward Purple Mountain. The Social and Athletic Building stood on the west side of the quadrangle, the Recitation Building on the north side, and the Science Building on the south side. The Social and Athletic Building, a gift of the Smith College Alumnae, was considered the “best example up to that time of Chinese style in architecture adapted to modern uses.” 
The new campus garnered attention from numerous local, national, and foreign celebrities, families and friends of the college, and students from all over the city. It soon became a landmark in Nanjing and a symbol of multifaceted significance for Ginling&#x27;s different constituencies. Even though it increased institutional self-esteem, it also roused envy among outsiders. The new campus designed by an American architect and built with American funds caused a certain tension between Ginling and its Chinese observers from the outside. Some criticized Ginling students’ extravagant lifestyles and even westernized mind-sets, which, they claimed, “disqualified Ginling students from being productive and patriotic members of modern China.” 

===After the Japanese Occupation===
During the three years that the Japanese took over the Nanjing campus in 1942, serious damages were done to the buildings. Walls were dirty and full of holes. All radiators and furnaces were gone, and so were most furniture, laboratory equipment, and library books. New alterations had been made: a new brick wall, a gatehouse complete with a prison cell, numerous wooden buildings, and military equipment were left behind by the Japanese soldiers. Dr. Davis S. Hsiung planned and supervised rehabilitation of the campus.

==Sister College==

Smith College located in Northampton, MA was the sister college of Ginling College, officially recognized from 1921 to 1951. Smith&#x27;s relationship with Ginling began in 1916. Through the enthusiasm of Smith alumnae Delia Leavens and Frederica Mead, both of whom had spent considerable time in China, the Smith College Association for Christian Work adopted Ginling as its foreign project.

Smith College provided both financial and academic support to Ginling College. There was a Ginling representative in every Smith club, and Smith alumnae contributed at least one-fourth of Ginling&#x27;s operating budget for years. Their first campus contribution in 1916 amounted to $1,000 and was made annually until 1921, when it was raised to $2,500, due to increasing interest in Ginling. During the difficult period of war, the contribution reached $4,000 a year. The Smith Alumnae Committee for Ginling was started in 1923, and Smith alumnae donated $50,000 for the construction of a recreation building in Ginling. Annual contributions to the College gradually increased until it reached a maximum of $5,500 a year.

Many Smith graduates also served as faculty at Ginling. By 1942, fifteen Smith alumnae had taught at Ginling.

Smith raised almost $2,500 as a gift to Ginling to celebrate its twenty-fifth birthday in 1940, and this money was used for repairs after the war.

<doc id="668985" wikidata="Q2140380" url="?curid=668985" title="Honda Integra (fourth generation)">
<text>The fourth-generation [[Honda Integra]] (chassis code DC5), produced by Honda, was introduced in Japan on 13 April 2001 and produced from July 2001 until August 2006. It was introduced in North America on 2 July 2001 as the Acura RSX, the name a part of Acura&#x27;s naming scheme changing the names of its models from recognizable names like &quot;Integra&quot; or &quot;Legend&quot; to alphabetical designations in order for buyers to build more recognition to the marque, and not the individual cars.

== Chassis and drivetrain ==
In concordance with the introduction of the Integra&#x27;s platform mate, the seventh-generation Civic being introduced in 2000, the Integra joined the Civic in abandoning Honda&#x27;s traditional double wishbone suspension at both ends and adopted MacPherson struts in the front and trailing arm type suspension in the rear along with the new K-series engine supplanting the B-series.

The K-series engine features intelligent VTEC (or i-VTEC), which electronically adjusts valve lift and duration between separate cam profiles, as well as valve timing with the implementation of a continuously variable sprocket, giving the 2.0 L engine a flatter torque curve relative to previous VTEC implementations which only adjusted valve lift and valve duration.

=== Facelift ===
The Integra received a facelift in 2004. The headlight and taillight assemblies lost the &quot;half circle&quot; on the bottom. This made the assemblies flush with the bumpers. The interior received new trim and gauge clusters, an immobilizer and alarm became standard, the body became stiffer, the suspension springs were redesigned, and the car&#x27;s tendency to bump steer was reduced.

== Markets ==

=== Japan ===
In Japan, the Integra was introduced in two versions, the iS (later renamed Type S in the 2004 refresh) and the Type R.

The iS/Type S (not to be confused with the RSX Type-S), featured the 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder K20A3 engine with an output of and mated to either a 5-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission. The 2001–2003 iS was available with 15-inch steel wheels with covers, or optional 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. The 2004–2006 Type S was equipped with 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels shared with the RSX Type-S. The JDM Type R had reduced weight, a 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder K20A engine that output 217 hp (164 kw)  (Japan-only; Oceania models use an engine similar to the RSX Type-S), 6-speed close-ratio manual transmission, as well as a helical limited-slip differential (LSD), stiffer springs and shocks, high intensity discharge (HID) bulbs paired with specially designed reflector headlights (different from all other RSX models), aluminum pedal set, 4-piston front Brembo brake calipers, 17-inch 5 double-spoke wheels on Bridgestone Potenza tires, Recaro suede seats/matching interior, leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel, body trim, front strut bar, and more. The Type R lacked many of the luxury features (like vanity mirrors or side airbags) found in the Type S, true to its racing heritage. The C package on the Type R added various accessories, such as a rear wiper, remote control, and folding mirrors. The JDM iS had one interior color, Ebony, in its first year. After 2002, Titanium interiors became available for all exterior colors. The Type S had redesigned cloth and leather seats. The Type R had choices of black/blue/red interiors (including color matching Recaro seats), depending on exterior colors. The refreshed Type R had the option of either the high wing, or the trunk lip spoiler. Both the iS and Type S were available with sunroof, and navigation systems. Additional interior and exterior accessories were available from Honda&#x27;s Modulo line. Modulo accessories offered include interior trim (shift knobs, decals, etc.), foglights, aero kits (front/side/rear bumper enhancements), wing spoilers, alloy wheels, push button start, upgraded speakers, and navigation.

Japan&#x27;s vehicle parts road compliance regulations means many tuning parts for the Integra can be purchased from Honda dealerships. For example, M&amp;M Honda, a Honda dealer, manages their own brand of parts. Honda tuner Mugen sells their performance parts via Honda dealers as accessories.



=== Oceania ===
In Australia, the Integra was available in four models: the base model, simply named Integra, Luxury, Type R and Type S. The base Integra was simply the Japanese-market iS, while the Luxury added accessories like leather-wrapped seats and a sunroof. Australian Type Rs were different from the JDM models, as they were not equipped with all of the features of the latter. They lacked the Brembo braking system, used the 200 hp K20A2 in place of the slightly more powerful K20A, and regular 16-inch 5-spoke wheels, painted in gun metal or white, were used instead of the 17-inch, 5 dual-spokes. However, the Australian Type R does retain the JDM model&#x27;s helical limited-slip differential, and full Type R interior (MOMO steering wheel, aluminum pedals and shift knob, Recaro seats and color matched carpets) and aero (wing and front/rear bumper lips). The Type R was dropped in 2004, and replaced by the Type-S, which was mechanically identical to the USDM RSX Type-S (though it did lack cruise control), but badged like the JDM Type-S. With the Integra&#x27;s refresh in 2004, the base model was dropped. The only trims available in 2006 was the Luxury and Type-S. Black was the only interior color available for the redesign. For facelifted Oceanic models, extra strengthening was given to fit higher safety regulations.

New Zealand only had two models, the VTi and Type R. The VTi came standard with alloy wheels, but was otherwise the same as the JDM iS. The Type R was also replaced by the Type-S like Australia in 2004. NZDM Type R models are the same as AUDM ones, but did not have ABS.


=== United States ===
In the US, the Acura RSX was available in two models: the base model, simply named RSX and the Type-S. The RSX came standard with numerous features, such as cruise control, 4-wheel disc brakes with ABS, power windows and a power moonroof. The RSX came with the 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder K20A3 engine throughout the entire production run.
Sport cloth seats were standard with optional perforated leather interior. Also available were optional 16-inch 7-spoke alloy wheels, which were very similar to those of the USDM DC2 Integra Type R (only 1 inch larger). The base model RSX was available with either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission with Sequential SportShift and Grade Logic Control.

From 2002-2004, the Type-S was equipped with a 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder K20A2 engine. Beginning in 2005, the engine was replaced with a more powerful 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder K20Z1 engine

The Type-S was only available with a close-ratio 6-speed manual. The Type-S included additional features such as sport seats with perforated leather-trimmed interior, sport-tuned suspension, gunmetal painted wheels, 11.8-inch ventilated front disc brakes, larger sway bars and a Bose 7-speaker sound system (including a subwoofer mounted on the spare tire) with AM/FM tuner, cassette and 6-disc in-dash CD changer.

One peculiar note for the initial 2002 model year were two available options. HID projector headlights from the Integra Type R was made available to the RSX for $1,500.

In 2005, the RSX and RSX Type-S received a styling refresh. On the exterior, the headlights and taillights were updated while the Type-S received an updated rear hatch spoiler. The base model received 12-spoke Enkei alloy wheels, while the Type-S came with 17-inch 5-spoke Enkei/Asahi wheels wrapped in Michelin HX MXM4 215/45/R17 tires. 17-inch Enkei J10s alloy wheels (with Acura specific fitment and center caps) were optional. The Type-S received a higher-output engine which included the camshafts, b-pipe and muffler, 4.77 final drive ratio, crankshaft pulley and the intake snorkel duct from the Japanese Type R.

The &quot;A-Spec Performance Package&quot; was a dealer-installed option for the Type-S. The body kit is essentially a debadged JDM Honda Modulo kit, while the wing is from the Type R. The package included a sport suspension system, under-body spoiler kit, wing spoiler (with stronger hatch shocks to hold additional weight), exterior badging and 5 dual-spoke 17 x 7.5-inch gun metal wheels with Yokohama AVS E100 225/45/R17 tires.

The RSX had numerous exterior color options but only two interior colors: Black (Ebony) and Beige (Titanium). The exterior color choice would dictate the interior color. Some colors were available in either trim package while other colors would be available in one trim level but not the other.

In 2002, color options were as follows:

In 2006, the available color combinations were as follows:

=== Canada ===
Three models were available in Canada: Base, Premium and Type-S. The base model came equipped with a cloth interior, no moonroof, unpainted side skirts and front lip and 15-inch steel wheels with wheel covers and lacked cruise control and anti-lock brakes. The Premium model added a power moonroof, 16-inch alloy wheels and heated leather seats. The Type-S came equipped with a 200-210 hp (depending on the model year) 2.0L DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine, larger front brakes, a BOSE sound system with a spare tire-mounted subwoofer, stiffer suspension, an oil cooler and an upper strut tower bar. The A-Spec package was available to the Type-S models. All Canadian cars with leather seats were heated along with side view mirrors.

The refresh in 2005 brought the same updates as USDM cars. The base model now has standard alloy wheels (16-inch, 12-spoke). Sport cloth seats are standard in 2005, optional leather in 2005-2006.

Wheel types varied according to model year. 2002-2004 models had a 15-inch steel wheel with covers (Base), 16-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels in silver (Premium) or gunmetal (Type-S). 2005-2006 had 12-spoke wheels for both Base and Premium. Type-S had the 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels. Acura branded Enkei J10s, 16-inch old ITR, and 17-inch 5-dual spoke A-Specs were available as accessory wheels.

The CDM (Canadian Domestic Market) RSX had the same interior as the USDM RSX, however the exterior and interior colours are different. e.g. CDM Taffeta/Premium White Pearl exterior cars came with Ebony black interiors.

== Safety ==
The RSX came equipped with dual-stage, dual-threshold front airbags, front side airbags with passenger-side OPDS, 3-point seat belts with load limiters and pretensions for front passengers, 4-wheel anti-lock brakes and side-impact door and floor beams.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has determined crash test ratings of the RSX.

== Performance ==
* 0-60 mph: 6.3 sec (2002–04 Type-S)
* 0-60 mph: 6.2 sec (2005–06 Type-S)
* Top speed : (drag limited) 
* Standing 1/4-mile: 15.8 sec (2002–06 Base)
* Standing 1/4-mile: 15.1 sec (2002–04 Type-S)
* Standing 1/4-mile: 14.6 sec (2005–06 Type-S) @ 95 mph
* 70 mph-0 mph braking distance : 
* skidpad : 0.86 g
* EPA Fuel Economy: city/ highway&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.fueleconomy.gov&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
The RSX was named in &quot;Car and Driver&quot;&#x27;s 10 Best List in 2002 and 2003.

== Racing ==
Acura won the Manufacturers&#x27; Championship of the SCCA World Challenge Touring Car class in 2006, running both RSXs and TSXs. RSX drivers finished in 5th and 9th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.
Kensai Racing used RSXs and TSXs in the KONI Challenge Series.
Badged as a Honda, the DC5 won the British Touring Car Championship with Matt Neal in 2005 and 2006, for Team Dynamics (branded as Team Halfords after the title sponsor). When competing a K24 engine swap from an Acura TSX or installing a supercharger/turbocharger is done by many.

<text>The Manumuskin River is a tributary of the Maurice River in Cumberland County, New Jersey in the United States.

The Manumuskin River flows through a relatively pristine forested area in the southern Pine Barrens of Cumberland County, as well as Atlantic white cedar bogs and salt marshes in its lower reaches. The name is of Lenape origin.

It rises approximately east of Vineland and flows south-southwest, joining the navigable estuary of the Maurice from the northeast approximately south-southeast of Millville and approximately upstream from the mouth of the Maurice on Delaware Bay.

Approximately of the watershed of the river are included in the Manumuskin River Preserve, established in 1983, the largest conservancy of its kind in New Jersey. Parts of the river are also designed as part of the Maurice Wild and Scenic River.

A local nonprofit organization, Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc., is a regional watershed organization that focuses its work on the Maurice River watershed, which includes the Manumuskin.

<doc id="669010" wikidata="Q1564707" url="?curid=669010" title="Li Jiao (Tang dynasty)">
<text>Li Jiao (), courtesy name Jushan (巨山), formally the Duke of Zhao (趙公), was an official of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Wu Zetian&#x27;s Zhou dynasty, serving as chancellor during the reigns of Wu Zetian, her sons Emperor Zhongzong and Emperor Ruizong, and her grandson Emperor Shang.

== Background ==
It is not known exactly when Li Jiao was born, but it is known that his family was from Zhao Prefecture (趙州, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). He came from a prominent clan, and his great-granduncle Li Yuancao (李元操) was a well-known official during Tang dynasty&#x27;s predecessor Sui dynasty. His father Li Zhen&#x27;e (李鎮惡), who had served as the magistrate of Xiangcheng County (襄城, in modern Xuchang, Henan), died early, and it was said that Li Jiao served his mother Lady Zhang with great filial piety. His literary talent began to be known when he was young, and his reputation matched that of Su Weidao, who was also from Zhao Prefecture. He already understood the Five Classics at age 14 and was praised by the chancellor Xue Yuanchao. He passed the imperial examination at age 19 and was made the sheriff of Anding County (安定, in modern Dingxi, Gansu). He was soon promoted to serve in the capital Chang&#x27;an, and he, along with older colleagues Luo Binwang and Liu Guangye (劉光業), became known for their literary talent.

Sometime during the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Li Jiao became an imperial censor. At that time, there was a Lao (獠) rebellion in Yong (邕州, roughly modern Nanning, Guangxi) and Yan (巖州, roughly modern Laibin, Guangxi) Prefectures, and Emperor Gaozong launched an army to suppress it, with Li Jiao serving as the army&#x27;s auditor. When the army reached Yong and Yan Prefectures, however, Li Jiao went to the rebel camps and persuaded the leaders to surrender, allowing the army to withdraw without a fight. He was later made imperial attendant (給事中, &quot;Jishizhong&quot;).

== During Wu Zetian&#x27;s reign ==
By 692, Emperor Gaozong&#x27;s wife Wu Zetian was reigning as &quot;emperor&quot; of her new Zhou dynasty, interrupting Tang dynasty. That year, her secret police official Lai Junchen had falsely accused the chancellors Ren Zhigu, Di Renjie, and Pei Xingben, along with other officials Cui Xuanli (崔宣禮), Lu Xian (盧獻), Wei Yuanzhong, and Li Sizhen (李嗣真) of treason. As these officials were set for execution, Wu Zetian had Li Jiao, along with two other officials, Zhang Deyu (張德裕) and Liu Xian (劉憲), review the cases. Zhang and Liu knew that the accusations were false, but feared Lai, and therefore initially failed to object to the judgments. Li Jiao advocated that they did, and so the three filed written objections. As a result, they offended Wu Zetian, and she demoted him to be the military advisor to the prefect of Run Prefecture (潤州, roughly modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). (The officials, however, were still spared after Di was able to secretly deliver a petition proclaiming his innocence to Wu Zetian.) After some time, Li Jiao was recalled to serve as &quot;Fengge Sheren&quot; (鳳閣舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (鳳閣, &quot;Fengge&quot;), and he became largely responsible for drafting imperial edicts. While serving in that office, in 697, when Eastern Tujue&#x27;s khan Ashina Mochuo made a request for Zhou to return Tujue people who had previously submitted to Tang and also to grant a number of supplies that he needed, Li Jiao lodged an objection against the recommendation of the chancellors Yao Shu and Yang Zaisi to comply, but Wu Zetian still granted Ashina Mochuo&#x27;s requests. Later that year, he took over the selection of officials at the ministry of civil service affairs (春官部, &quot;Chunguan Bu&quot;) on an acting basis, and he began establishing a list of reserve officials who would draw salaries from the imperial treasury. Also around that time, Wu Zetian had established an imperial censorate to review local government affairs (右御史臺), which would send out censors to examine the local government affairs, leaving the capital Luoyang in the third month of the lunar year and returning in the 11th month to report on findings. Li Jiao, believing that the time was insufficient, suggested dividing the empire into 20 circuits so that the censors had smaller areas to review. Wu Zetian initially agreed, but after opposition by other officials, did not carry out Li Jiao&#x27;s proposal.

As of 698, Li Jiao was serving as &quot;Mishu Shaojian&quot; (秘書少監), the deputy head of the Palace Library, when he was given the designation &quot;Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi&quot; (同鳳閣鸞臺平章事), making him a chancellor &quot;de facto&quot;. In 700, Wu Zetian, in order to give her lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong legitimacy in their entries into the palace, had Li Jiao head a project to create a work known as the &quot;Essence of Pearls from the Three Religions&quot; (三教珠英, &quot;Sanjiao Zhuying&quot;) – a compilation of various poetry about Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism – and had Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong involved in the project as well. Later that year, after Wu Zetian named Li Jiao&#x27;s uncle Zhang Xi as a chancellor, Li Jiao, who was by this point serving also as &quot;Luantai Shilang&quot; (鸞臺侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (鸞臺, &quot;Luantai&quot;), had his chancellor designation removed, because Wu Zetian did not want uncle and nephew to serve as chancellors at the same time. Li Jiao was instead made &quot;Chengjun Jijiu&quot; (成均祭酒), the principal of the imperial university.

By 702, Li Jiao was serving as deputy to the chancellor Wei Juyuan, who was serving as official in charge of Luoyang while Wu Zetian was at the western capital Chang&#x27;an, when Wu Zetian summoned Wei to Chang&#x27;an and had Li Jiao take over the responsibility at Luoyang.

By 703, when Wu Zetian changed the name of the executive bureau from &quot;Wenchang Tai&quot; (文昌臺) to &quot;Zhongtai&quot; (中臺), Li Jiao was serving as &quot;Zhongtai Zuo Cheng&quot; (中臺左丞), when he was made acting &quot;Nayan&quot; (納言), the head of the examination bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 704, in response to the problem that imperial officials were not willing to be local officials, Li Jiao and fellow chancellor Tang Xiujing suggested that the officials at the central government be assigned to the prefectures and counties to serve as officials, offering to go first themselves. Wu Zetian had 20 officials randomly drawn, and neither Li Jiao nor Tang was sent out. Later in 704, Li Jiao was made acting &quot;Neishi&quot; (內史), the head of the legislative bureau and also a post considered one for a chancellor. Also in 704, when Wu Zetian instituted a tax on the Buddhist monks and nuns of the realm to build a large Buddha statute, Li Jiao and Zhang Tinggui (張廷珪) opposed the project, and Wu Zetian eventually stopped it. Li Jiao then requested to be relieved of &quot;Neishi&quot; duties, and was given the chancellor designation &quot;Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin&quot; (同鳳閣鸞臺三品). Late in the year, he was removed of chancellor duties altogether, becoming minister of the treasury (地官尚書, &quot;Diguan Shangshu&quot;) instead.

== During Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s second reign ==
In 705, Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup, in which Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were killed. Wu Zetian&#x27;s son Li Xian the Crown Prince, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). Li Jiao was accused of having flattered Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong and was demoted out of the capital, to serve as the prefect of Yu Prefecture (豫州, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan), but before he departed for Yu Prefecture was made the prefect of Tong Prefecture (通州, in modern Beijing). Several months later, he was recalled to serve as deputy minister of civil service affairs (吏部侍郎, &quot;Libu Shilang&quot;), and was soon promoted to be the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, &quot;Libu Shangshu&quot;). It was said that when he was minister of civil service affairs, he, hoping to become chancellor again, expanded the roll of reserve officials and made many relatives and friends of powerful individuals reserve officials, in order to placate them.

In 706, Li Jiao was given the designation &quot;Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin&quot; (同中書門下三品), making him again a chancellor. That year, when Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s son-in-law Wang Tongjiao (王同皎) was accused of a treasonous plot with Zhang Zhongzhi (張仲之), Zu Yanqing (祖延慶), and Zhou Jing (周璟), of plotting to kill Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing (Wu Zetian&#x27;s nephew), the lover of Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s powerful wife Empress Wei and then depose Empress Wei, Zhang, while being interrogated, openly accused Empress Wei and Wu Sansi of adultery. Li Jiao, Wei Juyuan, and Yang Zaisi were assigned to the investigation, in addition the censors Li Chengjia (李承嘉) and Yao Shaozhi (姚紹之). Wei and Yang acted as if they did not hear Zhang&#x27;s accusation, while Li Jiao and Yao simply tried to have Zhang taken to prison for execution without acting on his accusation. Eventually, Wang and his associates were executed. Later that year, Li Jiao was again made the head of the legislative bureau, now with the title &quot;Zhongshu Ling&quot; (中書令). By this point, however, he had realized that his expansion of the roll of reserve officials was causing a major drain on the imperial treasury, and he, admitting this, offered to resign, an offer that Emperor Zhongzong declined.

In 707, Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s crown prince Li Chongjun, born of a concubine, was angry that Empress Wei&#x27;s daughter Li Guo&#x27;er the Princess Anle was repeatedly insulting him and trying to become crown princess to displace him, started a rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Sansi&#x27;s son Wu Chongxun (武崇訓, also Li Guo&#x27;er&#x27;s husband). He subsequently marched on the palace, hoping to arrest Li Guo&#x27;er, Empress Wei, and Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s concubine Consort Shangguan Wan&#x27;er. Li Jiao was one of the officials who commanded imperial guards in countering Li Chongjun&#x27;s attack, and Li Chongjun was eventually defeated and killed. Thereafter, Wei Yuanzhong, by this point a senior chancellor, was accused of association with Li Chongjun by Zong Chuke and Ji Chuna, and Li Jiao and Yang went along with Zong&#x27;s and Ji&#x27;s accusations; Wei was eventually exiled and died in exile.

In 708, when Emperor Zhongzong established an imperial literary institute Xiuwen Pavilion (修文館), Li Jiao was made a scholar at the institute, and Emperor Zhongzong often summoned the scholars for literary contests to be judged by Consort Shangguan. Also in 708, he was made minister of defense (兵部尚書, &quot;Bingbu Shangshu&quot;) and remained chancellor with the &quot;Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin&quot;. He was also created the Duke of Zhao and given the honorific title &quot;Tejin&quot; (特進).

== During Emperor Shang&#x27;s reign ==
In 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo&#x27;er, so that Empress Wei could become emperor like Wu Zetian and Li Guo&#x27;er could become crown princess. For the time, however, Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s son Li Chongmao the Prince of Wei, also by a concubine, was made emperor (as Emperor Shang). Empress Wei retained power as empress dowager and regent, and she, while consolidating her power, were apprehensive about Emperor Zhongzong&#x27;s brother Li Dan the Prince of Xiang, himself a former emperor, and his sister Princess Taiping. Li Jiao made a secret proposal to her to have Li Dan&#x27;s sons sent out of the capital to be prefectural officials—a proposal that Empress Dowager Wei either did not accept or had no chance to implement. Less than a month later, a coup led by Princess Taiping and Li Dan&#x27;s son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi killed Empress Wei and Li Guo&#x27;er. Emperor Shang was deposed, and Li Dan was restored to the throne (as Emperor Ruizong).

== During Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s second reign ==
Li Jiao initially remained chancellor after Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s return to the throne, but about a month later was demoted to be the prefect of Huai Prefecture (懷州, roughly modern Jiaozuo, Henan). He soon retired. In 713, Emperor Ruizong found out that Li Jiao had submitted the secret suggestion to Empress Dowager Wei to exile Emperor Ruizong&#x27;s sons. Some of the officials that Emperor Ruizong told this to suggested that Li Jiao be executed, but the chancellor Zhang Shuo pointed out that Li Jiao&#x27;s suggestion was a faithful one, as far as Empress Dowager Wei was concerned. Emperor Ruizong agreed, and while he issued an edict rebuking Li Jiao, he did not kill Li Jiao, although he made Li Jiao&#x27;s son Li Changzhi (李暢之) the prefect of Qian Prefecture (虔州, roughly modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) and had Li Jiao go with Li Changzhi to Qian Prefecture, effectively exiling him. At a later point, Li Jiao was made an advisor to the prefect of Lu Prefecture (廬州, roughly modern Hefei, Anhui), where he died at age 69.

<doc id="669011" wikidata="Q2309808" url="?curid=669011" title="This Land Is Your Land">
<text>&quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; is a song by American folk singer Woody Guthrie. One of the United States&#x27; most famous folk songs, its lyrics were written in 1940 in critical response to Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;God Bless America&quot;. Its melody is based on a Carter Family tune called &quot;When the World&#x27;s on Fire&quot;. When Guthrie was tired of hearing Kate Smith sing &quot;God Bless America&quot; on the radio in the late 1930s, he sarcastically called his song &quot;God Blessed America for Me&quot; before renaming it &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.

In 1989, a 1947 release on the Asch record label was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2002, &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; was one of 50 recordings chosen by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. In 2021, it was listed at No. 229 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;Top 500 Greatest Songs of All Time,&quot; and in 2025, it was listed at No. 11 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.&quot;

==Melody==
Guthrie&#x27;s melody was very similar to the melody of &quot;Oh, My Loving Brother&quot;, a Baptist gospel hymn that had been recorded by the Carter Family as &quot;When the World&#x27;s On Fire&quot; and had inspired their &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;, Pal of Mine.&quot; He used the same melody for the chorus and the verses.

Guthrie&#x27;s song, however, had a different melodic structure from the hymn or the similar Carter Family melodies, and he used only the first half of those melodies in his song. The melodic structure of the presumed models can be described as &quot;ABCD&quot;, a new melodic phrase for each of its four lines. Guthrie&#x27;s structure, however, is &quot;ABAC&quot;. As such, Guthrie&#x27;s rendition repeats the beginning of the melody (the &quot;A&quot; section) for his third line; the melodic phrase for his fourth line (&quot;This land was made for you and me&quot;) is found in neither the hymn nor the Carter Family melodies.

==Lyrics==

===Original 1940 lyrics===
The original lyrics were composed on February 23, 1940, in Guthrie&#x27;s room at the Hanover House hotel at 43rd St. and 6th Ave. (101 West 43rd St.) in New York. The line &quot;This land was made for you and me&quot; does not appear in the original manuscript at the end of each verse, but is implied by Guthrie&#x27;s writing of those words at the top of the page and by his subsequent singing of the line with those words.

According to Joe Klein, after Guthrie composed it, &quot;he completely forgot about the song, and didn&#x27;t do anything with it for another five years.&quot;

===1944 version lyrics===
In 1944 during World War II, Guthrie prepared another version which drops the two verses that are critical of the United States from the original: verse four, regarding private property, and verse six, regarding hunger. In 1940, Guthrie was in the anti-war phase he entered after the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, during which he wrote songs praising the Soviet invasion of Poland, attacking President Roosevelt&#x27;s loans to Finland in defense against the Soviets, and ridiculing lend-lease aid to the United Kingdom. By 1944, after Germany had invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Guthrie returned to vigorous support for U.S. involvement in Europe and a more anti-nationalism stance.

===Confirmation of two other verses===
A March 1944 recording in the possession of the Smithsonian, the earliest known recording of the song, has the &quot;private property&quot; verse included. This version was recorded the same day as 75 other songs. This was confirmed by several archivists for Smithsonian who were interviewed as part of the History Channel program &quot;Save Our History – Save our Sounds&quot;. The 1944 recording with this fourth verse can be found on &quot;Woody Guthrie: This Land is Your Land: The Asch Recordings Volume 1&quot;, where it is track 14.

Woodyguthrie.org also has a variant.

A 1945 pamphlet which omitted the last two verses has caused some question as to whether the original song did in fact contain the full text. The original manuscript confirms both of these verses.

As with other folk songs, it was sung with different words at various times, although the motives for this particular change of lyrics may involve the possible political interpretations of the verses. Recordings of Guthrie have him singing the verses with different words.

The verses critical of America are not often performed in schools or official functions. They can be best interpreted as a protest against the vast income inequalities that exist in the United States, and against the sufferings of millions during the Great Depression. The US, Guthrie insists, was made—and could still be made—for &quot;you and me&quot;. This interpretation is consistent with such other Guthrie songs as &quot;Pretty Boy Floyd&quot; and Guthrie&#x27;s lifelong struggle for social justice.

A rewritten Canadian version by Toronto-based folk group The Travellers was the first popular hit version of &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, receiving much airplay in Canada (although nowhere else) as early as 1956. Pete Seeger, a friend of both Woody Guthrie and of The Travellers, encouraged the Toronto band to &quot;do something&quot; with the song, which had been recorded by his group The Weavers in an unreleased version -- and Seeger felt it would &quot;never&quot; be released due to his being blacklisted. The Travellers thought making the song about Canada would appeal to their audience, so made the appropriate changes to the chorus, namechecking several Canadian locations in place of American ones. The private property and relief line verses were not included; it is possible The Travellers had never heard them prior to recording their version of the song. The song was an immediate hit in Canada, and remains The Travellers best-known recording. At the founding convention of the Canadian social democratic New Democratic Party in 1961, the Travellers&#x27; version of &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; was sung by the attending delegates. 

The song was revived in America the 1960s, when several artists of the new folk movement, including Bob Dylan, The Kingston Trio, Trini Lopez, Jay and the Americans, and The New Christy Minstrels all recorded versions, inspired by its political message. Peter, Paul and Mary recorded the song in 1962 for their &quot;Moving&quot; album. The Seekers recorded the song for their 1965 album, &quot;A World of Our Own&quot;. 

In March 1977, David Carradine, who had personified Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby&#x27;s 1976 biopic &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, appeared on Dinah Shore&#x27;s show, &quot;Dinah!&quot; On it, he performed a version of the song which included the two verses, with some variations:

In the film, the song is performed in the closing credits by several singers, starting with Carradine and including Woody Guthrie. The verse about the &quot;No Trespassing&quot; sign appears there, but the two verses are not in the soundtrack album&#x27;s version.

Bruce Springsteen first began performing it live on the River Tour in 1980, and released one such performance of it on &quot;Live/1975–85&quot;, in which he called it &quot;about one of the most beautiful songs ever written&quot;.

The song was performed by Springsteen and Pete Seeger, accompanied by Seeger&#x27;s grandson, Tao Rodríguez-Seeger, at We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial on January 18, 2009. The song was restored to the original lyrics (including the &#x27;There was a big high wall there&#x27; and &#x27;Nobody living can ever stop me&#x27; verses) for this performance (as per Pete Seeger&#x27;s request) with exceptions of the changes in the end of the &#x27;Private Property&#x27; and &#x27;Relief Office&#x27; verses; the former&#x27;s final line was changed from &quot;This land was made for you and me&quot; to &quot;That side was made for you and me,&quot; and the latter&#x27;s third and fourth lines to &quot;As they stood hungry, I stood there whistling, This land was made for you and me,&quot; from the original lyrics, &quot;As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking, Is this land made for you and me?&quot;

Voice actress and children&#x27;s entertainer Debi Derryberry recorded a version for her musical album &quot;What A Way To Play&quot; in 2006.

In 2010, Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey, the surviving members of Peter, Paul and Mary, requested that the National Organization for Marriage, which was at the time against legalization of same-sex marriage, stop using their recording of &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; at their rallies, stating in a letter that the organization&#x27;s philosophy was &quot;directly contrary to the advocacy position&quot; held by the group.

In 2019, Arlo Guthrie led a version of &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot; at the July 4 Boston Pops concert. Guthrie sang the &#x27;no trespassing&#x27; verse but substituted the first line of the &#x27;private property&#x27; verse (&#x27;There was a big high wall there, that tried to stop me / And on the wall it said &quot;no trespassing&quot;&#x27;), and Queen Latifah sang the &#x27;freedom highway&#x27; verse. The &#x27;Relief Office&#x27; verse was not included.

Arlo Guthrie tells a story in concerts on occasion, of his mother returning from a dance tour of China, and reporting around the Guthrie family dinner table that at one point in the tour she was serenaded by Chinese children singing the song. Arlo says Woody was incredulous: &quot;The Chinese? Singing &#x27;This land is your land, this land is my land? From California to the New York island?

On January 20, 2021, during the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden, Jennifer Lopez performed some verses of the song as part of a medley with &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. She excluded verses critical of the United States and interposed a Spanish-language translation of a portion of the Pledge of Allegiance.

==Variations==
As is the case with many well-known songs, it has been the subject of an enormous number of variations and parodies. They include:

===Versions about other countries===
Many variants of the song have been recorded with lyrics adjusted to fit diverse countries, regions, languages, and ethnic groups. They include:
=== Other variations ===

The song has been recorded by many performers over the years, ranging from American Country legend Glen Campbell, hardcore band Hated Youth, all the way to Turkish performer Nuri Sesigüzel to reggae group The Melodians.

*Peter, Paul and Mary – for their album &quot;Moving&quot; (1963)
*Bing Crosby – for the album &quot;America, I Hear You Singing&quot; (1964)
*The Seekers – in the album &quot;A World of Our Own&quot; (1965)
*Connie Francis – included in her album &quot;Connie Francis and The Kids Next Door&quot; (1966)
*Tennessee Ernie Ford – recorded for his album &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; (1970)
* David Carradine - in the soundtrack album of &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, Woody Guthrie&#x27;s biopic directed by Hal Ashby (1976)

*Johnny Logan – on the album, &quot;Irishman in America&quot; (2008).
* Raffi – on his album, &quot;Love Bug&quot; (2014).

A version called &quot;This badge is your badge&quot;, about FC United of Manchester, was written by fan Mickey O&#x27;Farrell, and is often sung by fans at the club&#x27;s matches.

===In film, television, internet, books, and advertising===

The song has been sung by characters in many film and television productions, including &quot;Bob Roberts&quot; (1992), &quot;Stepmom&quot; (1998), &quot;Full House&quot;, &quot;The Luck of the Irish&quot; (a Disney Channel original movie), &quot;Up in the Air&quot; (2009) and by Renée Zellweger in the 2010 film &quot;My Own Love Song&quot;.

It has been parodied many times, including:
* A lyrically restored version of the song was featured in &quot;Disneyland Showtime&quot;, a 1970 episode of &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;, performed by The Kids of the Kingdom with Jay and Donny Osmond. Here, the lyrics were changed to describe the many attractions and experiences at Disneyland.
* In the &quot;Home Improvement&quot; episode &quot;Too Many Cooks&quot; (1994), Tim refers to Al as &quot;Al &#x27;This Land Is&#x27; Borland&quot;.
* A 1999 episode of &quot;Friends&quot; when Joey meets a man he believes to be his &quot;hand-twin&quot;, resulting in the lyric &quot;This hand is my hand.&quot;
* The 1999 film &quot;Sonnenallee&quot; features a version performed by Alexander Hacke, changing the geographical references in the first verse to match those of East Germany, where the film takes place.
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Lisa the Treehugger&quot; (2000) with the words changed to &quot;This log is my log, this log is your log&quot; in reference to a runaway giant redwood tree.
* The &quot;Arthur&quot; episode &quot;The Pride of Lakewood&quot; with the words changed to &quot;This school&#x27;s a great school, this school&#x27;s a cool school&quot;.
* The June 27, 2009 episode of &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; by Arlo Guthrie as &quot;This Song is My Song&quot;.
* In fourth-season episode of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the Indian-born Raj Koothrappali recites the first verse of the song out of fear of deportation in an interview with an FBI agent to clarify his relationship with the United States.
* It was featured as soundtrack for the 2011 documentary &quot;The Ambassador&quot;.
* In the television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; (episode &quot;Northern Hospitality&quot; Season 5 #16), Holling Vincoeur sings a modified version with references to Canada to his wife, Shelly Vincoeur.
* Indie rock band My Morning Jacket recorded the song for a North Face advertising campaign in 2014.
* In 2016, Budweiser temporarily rebranded their flagship beer &quot;America&quot;, and included the lyrics &quot;...from the redwood forests, to the gulf stream waters, this land was made for you and me&quot; on their labels.
* Pop singer Lady Gaga sang a few phrases of the song at the beginning of the performance of her halftime show of the 2017 Super Bowl.
* Los Angeles-based Latin band Chicano Batman sang a cover for a commercial for Johnnie Walker including both English and Spanish lyrics.
* Country artist Sam Hunt covered the song for &quot;Bright: The Album&quot;, the soundtrack to the 2017 film, &quot;Bright&quot;.
* Musician Dave Matthews often includes a few lines when he sings the live version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Drink the Water&quot; (which is about how America stole land from Natives while massacring them along the way) as an ironic juxtaposition in order to highlight the fact that while Americans claim the land as &quot;ours&quot;, it was not theirs to take.
* The version by Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings is featured in the opening credits of &quot;Up in the Air&quot; (2009), and in the closing credits of the 2019 Netflix documentary &quot;Knock Down the House&quot;.
* The FX on Hulu series &quot;Mrs. America&quot; (episode 8 &quot;Houston&quot;) depicts a group of women singing the song with a guitar. Actress Sarah Paulson&#x27;s character (Alice McCray) joins in by singing one of the variant verses often omitted (&quot;Nobody living can ever stop me, As I go walking that freedom highway; Nobody living can ever make me turn back, This land was made for you and me&quot;). Another character points to McCray that the song was written by Guthrie, referred to as &quot;a socialist&quot; (a point relevant in the dialogue to state a contradiction between McCray&#x27;s conservative views and her love for the song). This could be the reason to pick such an obscure verse, as this particular verse can only be linked to Guthrie and not to one of the many versions of the song by other artist.

==Copyright controversy==
A widely published quote of Guthrie&#x27;s about copyright has been cited by some scholars to suggest that he was against copyright protection for his work:

This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don&#x27;t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that&#x27;s all we wanted to do.

Kembrew McLeod suggested this quote was made by Guthrie in reference to &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;, but that claim is inaccurate. The copyright registration number &quot;#154085&quot; referenced in the quote is for Guthrie&#x27;s song &quot;California!&quot; (also known as &quot;California! California!&quot; or &quot;California! The Land of the Sky!&quot;). The quote was printed under the lyrics to &quot;California!&quot; in a songbook Guthrie made in 1937 – three years before the first draft of &quot;This Land&quot; was written.

A number of different organizations claim copyright for the song.

According to the Carter Family, the melody came from a tune that A.P. Carter had found and recorded with Sarah and Maybelle Carter prior to 1934 and was not original to Guthrie.

In July 2004, the website JibJab hosted a parody of the song, with George W. Bush and John Kerry singing altered lyrics to comment on the U.S. presidential election that November, resulting in The Richmond Organization, a music publisher that owns the copyright to Guthrie&#x27;s tune through its Ludlow Music unit, threatening legal action.

JibJab then sued to affirm their parody was fair use, with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) acting for them. As part of their research on the case they found that the song had been first published by Woody Guthrie in 1945, although the copyright was not registered until 1956. This meant that when Ludlow applied to renew the copyright in 1984 they were 11 years too late as the song had been in the public domain since 1973 (28 years from first publication). The Richmond Organization settled with JibJab shortly thereafter, agreeing that JibJab were free to distribute their parody. In an interview on NPR, Arlo Guthrie said that he thought the parody was hilarious and he thought Woody would have loved it too. Richmond still, however, claims copyright on other versions of the song, such as those appearing in the 1956 and later publications. Legally, such claims only apply to original elements of the song that were not in the public domain version.

The Richmond Organization and Ludlow Music were sued in 2016 over their claims of copyright in a lawsuit led by Randall Newman. In a similar case, Newman previously successfully argued the song &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; was public domain. In February 2020, Judge P. Kevin Castel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the case because the plaintiffs had already paid the license fee, so there was no legal dispute to adjudicate.

<text>Carol Weihrer (August 21, 1951 - April 27, 2024) was an activist for victims of anesthesia awareness. Beginning in 1989, Weihrer had chronic pain from recurrent corneal erosion syndrome. After 14 unsuccessful surgeries to relieve the increasing severity of the pain, in 1998 she underwent an enucleation of the eye and reportedly woke up from anesthesia during the procedure. Although she didn&#x27;t feel any pain during the surgery, she remembered the entire experience afterwards. Weihrer received an out-of-court settlement and maintained that she has post-traumatic stress disorder as result of her experience.

Weihrer died on April 27, 2024.

<text>The Reverend DeForest Blake &quot;Buster&quot; Soaries, Jr. (born August 20, 1951) is an African-American Baptist minister, author and public advocate, from Montclair, New Jersey. He is the former Secretary of State of New Jersey and former chairman of the federal Election Assistance Commission. He was the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens in Somerset, New Jersey, a position he had held since November 1990 until his retirement from the church in June 2021.

== Personal life ==
A resident of the Monmouth Junction section of South Brunswick, New Jersey, he is married to Margaret Donna Soaries (Pleasant). The couple have twin sons, Malcolm and Martin.

Soaries received a Bachelor of Arts from Fordham University; a Master of Divinity degree from Princeton Theological Seminary; and a Doctor of Ministry degree from United Theological Seminary. He has also received five honorary doctorate degrees from other institutions.

== First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens ==

Soaries had served as the senior pastor of First Baptist Church of Lincoln Garden (FBCLG) in Somerset, New Jersey, from November 1990 until his retirement in June 2021.

== Politics ==
From January 1999 to January 2002, Soaries served as Secretary of State of New Jersey, making him the first African-American male to do so. He served under then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. In that position he endorsed further funding for the arts, and served as an unofficial general advisor to the governor. He also created V-FREE, a statewide youth violence prevention program.

In 2002, Soaries was the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives from the 12th C.D. of New Jersey, losing to incumbent Democrat Rush D. Holt, Jr. In 2003, he was appointed to the federal Election Assistance Commission, which was established by Congress to implement the Help America Vote Act of 2002, and served as chairman.

A proponent of faith-based community development, and of President Bush&#x27;s faith-based initiative, Soaries, through church donations, formed several non-profit community development agencies, including the Renaissance Community Development Credit Union, Renaissance Education &amp; Technology Academy and the Harvest of Hope Family Services Network.

Soaries was chosen by Coretta Scott King as the keynote speaker at the 2000 Martin Luther King Jr. celebration in Atlanta. He has also worked for the Urban League and Operation PUSH.

== Central Jersey Community Development Corporation ==
In 1992, Soaries founded the Central Jersey Community Development Corporation (CJCDC): a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization that specializes in revitalizing distressed neighborhoods.

Central Jersey Community Development Corporation (CJCDC) was founded in 1992 and incorporated in 1993. The organization&#x27;s mission is to “rebuild communities, one family at a time” by improving the social, educational and economic conditions in targeted areas in Central Jersey. Its goal is to impact the lives of low to moderate income families to help them develop a better quality of life. Its vision is to preserve family institutions and help make individuals better community members. CJCDC has a long history of helping vulnerable communities in New Jersey come into transition, namely by positioning then for improvement, economic growth and sustainability.

CJCDC&#x27;s neighborhood revitalization efforts are based on the notion that there is a role that people must play in their own uplift. There are social enterprise led by grass-roots organizations that are very close to the people who have need. If supported and empowered, they can help people who otherwise would be stuck in poverty.

== Harvest of Hope Family Services Network, Inc. ==
In 1996, Soaries founded the Harvest of Hope Family Services Network, Inc. (HOH). Harvest of Hope Family Network Services, Inc. is a faith-based organization that recruits and trains churches, agencies and community organizations to use HOH unique and proven strategies for recruiting families to foster and adopt children.

The Harvest of Hope Program created a systematic approach designed to identify, recruit and train potential foster parents. Initial recruitment efforts focused exclusively on First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens. Within a matter of weeks, 85 families were recruited and licensed as foster family homes in the State of New Jersey. More importantly, all 57 boarder babies were placed in Harvest of Hope recruited and trained foster family homes. The success of this initial intervention gave rise to the creation of Harvest of Hope Family Services Network, Inc. (HOH), a new, First Baptist affiliated not-for-profit entity that developed and trained a network of churches throughout New Jersey to do what was done at First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens: recruit families to become foster family homes for youth in foster care.

Harvest of Hope Family Services Network, Inc., expanded their services to include extensive pre and post placement support for foster-parent recruits who successfully completed the program to become DCP&amp;P approved homes for child placement. This support included a major emphasis on retention activities, life skills and behavioral health training, in addition to liaison and advocacy assistance – all designed to provide ongoing care, nurture and stable homes to children in need. In addition, the Harvest of Hope program grew to include the placement of children, teens and sibling groups. For many years, Harvest of Hope managed a family reunification component that provided assistance to the New Jersey State DCP&amp;P in the facilitation of the placement of children into appropriate homes as well as in-service training for existing foster families.

== Current activities ==
Soaries serves as an independent director at three companies: Independence Realty Trust, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and Ocean Financial Corporation.

<text>Autocomplete, or word completion, is a feature in which an application predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In Android and iOS smartphones, this is called predictive text. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the down arrow key to accept one of several.

Autocomplete speeds up human-computer interactions when it correctly predicts the word a user intends to enter after only a few characters have been typed into a text input field. It works best in domains with a limited number of possible words (such as in command line interpreters), when some words are much more common (such as when addressing an e-mail), or writing structured and predictable text (as in source code editors).

Many autocomplete algorithms learn new words after the user has written them a few times, and can suggest alternatives based on the learned habits of the individual user.

== Definition ==
=== Original purpose ===
The original purpose of word prediction software was to help people with physical disabilities increase their typing speed, as well as to help them decrease the number of keystrokes needed in order to complete a word or a sentence. The need to increase speed is noted by the fact that people who use speech-generating devices generally produce speech at a rate that is less than 10% as fast as people who use oral speech. But the function is also very useful for anybody who writes text, particularly people–such as medical doctors–who frequently use long, hard-to-spell terminology that may be technical or medical in nature.

=== Description ===
Autocomplete or word completion works so that when the writer writes the first letter or letters of a word, the program predicts one or more possible words as choices. If the intended word is included in the list, the writer can select it, for example, by using the number keys. If the word that the user wants is not predicted, the writer must enter the next letter of the word. At this time, the word choice(s) is altered so that the words provided begin with the same letters as those that have been selected. When the word that the user wants appears it is selected, and the word is inserted into the text. In another form of word prediction, words most likely to follow the just written one are predicted, based on recent word pairs used. Word prediction uses language modeling, where within a set vocabulary the words are most likely to occur are calculated. Along with language modeling, basic word prediction on AAC devices is often coupled with a frecency model, where words the AAC user has used recently and frequently are more likely to be predicted. Word prediction software often also allows the user to enter their own words into the word prediction dictionaries either directly, or by &quot;learning&quot; words that have been written. Some search returns related to genitals or other vulgar terms are often omitted from autocompletion technologies, as are morbid terms

== History ==
The autocomplete and predictive text technology was invented by Chinese scientists and linguists in the 1950s to solve the input inefficiency of the Chinese typewriter, as the typing process involved finding and selecting thousands of logographic characters on a tray, drastically slowing down the word processing speed.

In the 1950s, typists came to rearrange the character layout from the standard dictionary layout to groups of common words and phrases. Chinese typewriter engineers innovated mechanisms to access common characters accessible at the fastest speed possible by word prediction, a technique used today in Chinese input methods for computers, and in text messaging in many languages. According to Stanford University historian Thomas Mullaney, the development of modern Chinese typewriters from the 1960s to 1970s influenced the development of modern computer word processors and affected the development of computers themselves.

== Types of autocomplete tools ==
There are standalone tools that add autocomplete functionality to existing applications. These programs monitor user keystrokes and suggest a list of words based on first typed letter(s). Examples are Typingaid and Letmetype. LetMeType, freeware, is no longer developed, the author has published the source code and allows anybody to continue development. Typingaid, also freeware, is actively developed. Intellicomplete, both a freeware and payware version, works only in certain programs which hook into the intellicomplete server program. Many Autocomplete programs can also be used to create a Shorthand list. The original autocomplete software was Smartype, which dates back to the late 1980s and is still available today. It was initially developed for medical transcriptionists working in WordPerfect for MS/DOS, but it now functions for any application in any Windows or Web-based program.

=== Shorthand ===
Shorthand, also called Autoreplace, is a related feature that involves automatic replacement of a particular string with another one, usually one that is longer and harder to type, such as &quot;myname&quot; with &quot;Lee John Nikolai François Al Rahman&quot;. This can also quietly fix simple typing errors, such as turning &quot;teh&quot; into &quot;the&quot;. Several Autocomplete programs, standalone or integrated in text editors, based on word lists, also include a shorthand function for often used phrases.

=== Context completion ===
Context completion is a text editor feature, similar to word completion, which completes words (or entire phrases) based on the current context and context of other similar words within the same document, or within some training data set. The main advantage of context completion is the ability to predict anticipated words more precisely and even with no initial letters. The main disadvantage is the need of a training data set, which is typically larger for context completion than for simpler word completion. Most common use of context completion is seen in advanced programming language editors and IDEs, where training data set is inherently available and context completion makes more sense to the user than broad word completion would.

Line completion is a type of context completion, first introduced by Juraj Simlovic in TED Notepad, in July 2006. The context in line completion is the current line, while the current document poses as a training data set. When the user begins a line that starts with a frequently used phrase, the editor automatically completes it, up to the position where similar lines differ, or proposes a list of common continuations.

Action completion in applications are standalone tools that add autocomplete functionality to existing applications or all existing applications of an OS, based on the current context. The main advantage of Action completion is the ability to predict anticipated actions. The main disadvantage is the need of a data set. Most common use of Action completion is seen in advanced programming language editors and IDEs. But there are also action completion tools that work globally, in parallel, across all applications of the entire PC without (very) hindering the action completion of the respective applications.

== Software integration ==

=== In web browsers ===

In web browsers, autocomplete is done in the address bar (using items from the browser&#x27;s history) and in text boxes on frequently used pages, such as a search engine&#x27;s search box. Autocomplete for web addresses is particularly convenient because the full addresses are often long and difficult to type correctly. 

==== In web forms ====
Autocompletion or &quot;autofill&quot; is frequently found in web browsers, used to fill in web forms automatically. When a user inputs data into a form and subsequently submits it, the web browser will often save the form&#x27;s contents by default. 

This feature is commonly used to fill in login credentials. However, when a password field is detected, the web browser will typically ask the user for explicit confirmation before saving the password in its password store, often secured with a built-in password manager to allow the use of a &quot;master password&quot; before credentials can be autofilled.

Most of the time, such as in Internet Explorer and Google Toolbar, the entries depend on the form field&#x27;s name, so as to not enter street names in a last name field or vice versa. For this use, proposed names for such form fields, in earlier HTML 5 specifications this RFC is no longer referenced, thus leaving the selection of names up to each browser&#x27;s implementation.

Certain web browsers such as Opera automatically autofill credit card information and addresses.

An individual webpage may enable or disable browser autofill by default. This is done in HTML with the codice_1 attribute in a codice_2 element or its corresponding form elements.
&lt;!-- Autocomplete turned on by default --&gt;
&lt;form autocomplete=&quot;on&quot;&gt;

 &lt;!-- This form element has autocomplete turned on --&gt;
 &lt;input name=&quot;username&quot; autocomplete=&quot;on&quot;&gt;

 &lt;!-- While this one inherits its parent form&#x27;s value --&gt;
 &lt;input name=&quot;password&quot; type=&quot;password&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
It has been shown that the autofill feature of modern browsers can be exploited in a phishing attack with the use of hidden form fields, which allows personal information such as the user&#x27;s phone number to be collected.

=== In e-mail programs ===
In e-mail programs autocomplete is typically used to fill in the e-mail addresses of the intended recipients. Generally, there are a small number of frequently used e-mail addresses, hence it is relatively easy to use autocomplete to select among them. Like web addresses, e-mail addresses are often long, hence typing them completely is inconvenient.

For instance, Microsoft Outlook Express will find addresses based on the name that is used in the address book. Google&#x27;s Gmail will find addresses by any string that occurs in the address or stored name.

=== In search engines ===
In search engines, autocomplete user interface features provide users with suggested queries or results as they type their query in the search box. This is also commonly called &quot;autosuggest&quot; or &quot;incremental search&quot;. This type of search often relies on matching algorithms that forgive entry errors such as phonetic Soundex algorithms or the language independent Levenshtein algorithm. The challenge remains to search large indices or popular query lists in under a few milliseconds so that the user sees results pop up while typing.

Autocomplete can have an adverse effect on individuals and businesses when negative search terms are suggested when a search takes place. Autocomplete has now become a part of reputation management as companies linked to negative search terms such as scam, complaints and fraud seek to alter the results. Google in particular have listed some of the aspects that affect how their algorithm works, but this is an area that is open to manipulation.

=== In source code editors ===
Autocompletion of source code is also known as code completion. In a source code editor, autocomplete is greatly simplified by the regular structure of the programming language. There are usually only a limited number of words meaningful in the current context or namespace, such as names of variables and functions. An example of code completion is Microsoft&#x27;s IntelliSense design. It involves showing a pop-up list of possible completions for the current input prefix to allow the user to choose the right one. This is particularly useful in object-oriented programming because often the programmer will not know exactly what members a particular class has. Therefore, autocomplete then serves as a form of convenient documentation as well as an input method.

Another beneficial feature of autocomplete for source code is that it encourages the programmer to use longer, more descriptive variable names, hence making the source code more readable. Typing large words which may contain camel case like codice_3 can be difficult, but autocomplete allows a programmer to complete typing the word using a fraction of the keystrokes.

=== In database query tools ===
Autocompletion in database query tools allows the user to autocomplete the table names in an SQL statement and column names of the tables referenced in the SQL statement. As text is typed into the editor, the context of the cursor within the SQL statement provides an indication of whether the user needs a table completion or a table column completion. The table completion provides a list of tables available in the database server the user is connected to. The column completion provides a list of columns for only tables referenced in the SQL statement. SQL Server Management Studio provides autocomplete in query tools.

=== In word processors ===
In many word processing programs, autocompletion decreases the amount of time spent typing repetitive words and phrases. The source material for autocompletion is either gathered from the rest of the current document or from a list of common words defined by the user. Currently Apache OpenOffice, Calligra Suite, KOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Office include support for this kind of autocompletion, as do advanced text editors such as Emacs and Vim.
* Apache OpenOffice Writer and LibreOffice Writer have a working word completion program that proposes words previously typed in the text, rather than from the whole dictionary
* Microsoft Excel spreadsheet application has a working word completion program that proposes words previously typed in upper cells

=== In command-line interpreters ===
In a command-line interpreter, such as Unix&#x27;s sh or bash, or Windows&#x27;s cmd.exe or PowerShell, or in similar command line interfaces, autocomplete of command names and file names may be accomplished by keeping track of all the possible names of things the user may access. Here autocomplete is usually done by pressing the  key after typing the first several letters of the word. For example, if the only file in the current directory that starts with x is xLongFileName, the user may prefer to type x and autocomplete to the complete name. If there were another file name or command starting with x in the same scope, the user would type more letters or press the Tab key repeatedly to select the appropriate text.

== Efficiency ==

=== Research ===
Although research has shown that word prediction software does decrease the number of keystrokes needed and improves the written productivity of children with disabilities, there are mixed results as to whether or not word prediction actually increases speed of output. It is thought that the reason why word prediction does not always increase the rate of text entry is because of the increased cognitive load and requirement to move eye gaze from the keyboard to the monitor.

In order to reduce this cognitive load, parameters such as reducing the list to five likely words, and having a vertical layout of those words may be used. The vertical layout is meant to keep head and eye movements to a minimum, and also gives additional visual cues because the word length becomes apparent. Although many software developers believe that if the word prediction list follows the cursor, that this will reduce eye movements, in a study of children with spina bifida by Tam, Reid, O&#x27;Keefe &amp; Nauman (2002) it was shown that typing was more accurate, and that the children also preferred when the list appeared at the bottom edge of the screen, at the midline. Several studies have found that word prediction performance and satisfaction increases when the word list is closer to the keyboard, because of the decreased amount of eye-movements needed.

Software with word prediction is produced by multiple manufacturers. The software can be bought as an add-on to common programs such as Microsoft Word (for example, WordQ+SpeakQ, Typing Assistant, Co:Writer, Wivik, Ghotit Dyslexia), or as one of many features on an AAC device (PRC&#x27;s Pathfinder, Dynavox Systems, Saltillo&#x27;s ChatPC products). Some well known programs: Intellicomplete, which is available in both a freeware and a payware version, but works only with programs which are made to work with it. Letmetype and Typingaid are both freeware programs which work in any text editor.

An early version of autocompletion was described in 1967 by H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins in his Computer-Assisted Typewriter (CAT), &quot;such words as &#x27;BEGIN&#x27; or &#x27;PROCEDURE&#x27; or identifiers introduced by the programmer, would be automatically completed by the CAT after the programmer had typed only one or two symbols.&quot;

<text>Americo Sebastiano Costantino (born October 1, 1961) is an American professional wrestler. He performed under the ring names Rico Costantino and Rico in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from 1998 to 2004.

== Early life ==
Costantino was a contestant on the American television series &quot;American Gladiators&quot;. When challenging one of the show&#x27;s gladiators, Gemini, Constantino won once and fought to a draw twice in their three Joust bouts. Costantino was the champion for the first half of the 1990–1991 season. In the Grand Championship, Rico came up just short, losing to Craig Branham by 7 points (3 1/2 seconds) in the Eliminator portion of the show. Costantino next appeared on the European game show Fort Boyard, with a win over his former Gladiator nemesis Craig Branham. On the show, he was the only competitor to capture the highest tiered “red ball” in the bungee jump challenge on an upswing.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Ohio Valley Wrestling and early career (1998–2002)===
Costantino began to train with the Empire Wrestling Federation for a career in the wrestling business. Costantino was discovered by World Wrestling Federation (WWF) officials Terry Taylor and Dr. Tom Prichard. After only 12 matches, Costantino signed a developmental deal with the WWF. Costantino was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for further training, before being sent up to work for WWF.

He became a three time OVW Champion, a MPPW Heavyweight Champion and a HWA Heavyweight Champion.

In 2001, started working dark matches for the WWF against Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar, Raven, Hurricane Helms, Billy Gunn and Steven Richards.

===World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment (2002–2004)===
He debuted in WWF on the March 21, 2002 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as the stylist of Billy and Chuck (the heel gimmicks of Billy Gunn and Chuck Palumbo), establishing himself as a villain. Rico portrayed a homosexual stylist as his gimmick and grew muttonchops. On the May 9 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rico wrestled his first match in WWE, where he teamed with Billy and Chuck to defeat Al Snow, Maven and Rikishi. At Judgment Day, Rico was forced to team with Rikishi to defeat his clients, Billy and Chuck for the WWE Tag Team Championship. On the June 6 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rico turned on Rikishi by helping Billy and Chuck in pinning Rikishi for the tag titles.

On the September 12, 2002 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Rico moved over to the Raw brand and became the manager of 3-Minute Warning (then-heel, Rosey and Jamal). He ended up turning on 3-Minute Warning after they lost a match to the Dudley Boyz. However both he and 3-Minute Warning all remained heels during that time. After turning on 3-Minute Warning, Rico scored an upset victory over Ric Flair.
Rico would soon return to Raw in 2003 with Miss Jackie appearing as his manager. He retained the essence of the masculinity gimmick he shared with Gunn and Palumbo while taking it to new levels, much in the vein of Adrian Street and painting his face and later grew out his hair. Then, on the March 22, 2004 edition of Raw, Rico got drafted to SmackDown! and became a fan favorite due to fan reaction to his over-the-top exótico style gimmick, teaming up with an initially reluctant partner, Charlie Haas, (with whom he held the WWE Tag Team Championship) and had a valet, Miss Jackie. Rico was unexpectedly released by WWE on November 7, 2004.

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (2005) ===
After his release, he went to All-Japan Pro Wrestling, where he and former WWE colleague Bull Buchanan defeated Mitsuya Nagai and Masayuki Naruse on the first event of the &quot;Excite Series&quot; in Tokyo, Japan to win the All Asia Tag Team Championship. Costantino retired from professional wrestling in July 2005, causing him and Buchanan to vacate the All Asia Tag Team Titles.

=== Future Stars of Wrestling (2012) ===
Rico came out of retirement for a Future Stars of Wrestling (FSW) TV taping in Las Vegas on November 17, 2012, where he teamed up with Beast to defeat the team of Gregory Sharpe and Clutch.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2024) ===
On October 12, 2024, Rico made an appearance for All Elite Wrestling on the WrestleDream Zero Hour, managing MxM Collection.

== Personal life ==
Costantino entered Northwestern Military and Naval Academy, graduating near the top of his class and at one point considered enrollment at West Point. Whilst attending Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, Costantino returned to Las Vegas and settled into a career as a paramedic, which in turn led to enrollment in the police academy. Costantino was also on the SWAT team at one point, paving the way for his next career as a bodyguard.

In August 2005, Costantino completed his law enforcement training in Boulder City, Nevada, outside of Las Vegas. As of 2006, he was a Sergeant Inspector for the Nevada Taxi Cab Authority. Beginning in 2016, he suffered health issues relating to heart problems and a series of concussions.

<doc id="669041" wikidata="Q234591" url="?curid=669041" title="Ringo Sheena">
<text>, known by her stage name , is a Japanese singer, songwriter and musician. She is also the founder and lead vocalist of the band Tokyo Jihen.

She describes herself as &quot;&quot;. She was ranked number 36 in a list of Japan&#x27;s top 100 musicians compiled by HMV in 2003.

== Career ==
=== Initial solo career ===
Sheena released her first official single &quot;Kōfukuron&quot; in May 1998, when she was 19 years old. She subsequently made singles &quot;Kabukichō no Joō&quot; and &quot;Koko de Kiss Shite&quot;, the latter becoming her first hit.

This was followed by the release of her first album, &quot;Muzai Moratorium&quot;, in February 1999. The album was a major hit. &quot;Gips&quot; was due to be the next single, but when Sheena had to cancel recording due to illness, &quot;Honnō&quot; was released as the fourth single instead. Sheena chose a hospital as the setting for the music video for &quot;Honnō&quot;.

The fifth and sixth singles, &quot;Gips&quot; and &quot;Tsumi to Batsu&quot;, were released at the same time to prevent overlap with the release of her second album, &quot;Shōso Strip&quot;, in March 2000.

Sheena had initially indicated that she would retire as &quot;Sheena Ringo&quot; when she had released three albums. At the time the second album was released, she was among the top three Japanese female artists, along with Hikaru Utada and Ayumi Hamasaki, in terms of popularity and annual income. However, she was uncomfortable with being regarded as an icon, and wanted her career to branch out more from the mainstream. When she began to produce her third album under the tentative title &quot;&quot; she intended to make it her last solo album.

She released the single &quot;Mayonaka wa Junketsu&quot; in March 2001, with the intention of including it on a third album. The music video was created in a retro-anime style that depicted Ringo as a sort of mid-&#x27;60s spy movie heroine. In 2002, she released a two-disc multilingual cover album &quot;Utaite Myōri: Sono Ichi&quot;. Since she felt that a cover album did not count as a &quot;bona fide&quot; album, she began to work on her third original album.

In 2003, she released her third album, titled &quot;Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana&quot;.

Towards the conclusion of her solo career, she released her final solo single, &quot;Ringo no Uta&quot; (&quot;Apple Song&quot;), which was adopted by the national children&#x27;s song TV program &quot;Minna no Uta&quot;. This song had a summation of her career, and the music video included references to all of her previous videos.

In 2004, Sheena undertook the role of music director for the stage play KKP (Kentaro Kobayashi Produce) No. 004 &quot;Lens&quot;, which is based on the story of her short film &quot;Tanpen Kinema Hyaku-Iro Megane&quot;.

=== Tokyo Jihen ===
On May 31, 2004, Sheena formed a band called .

The original lineup of Tokyo Jihen was Ringo Sheena (vocals, guitar, melodica), (guitar, backing vocals); (bass guitar); H Zett M (stylized as H ZETT M), also known as , (keyboard/piano); and (drums). The band was first introduced in Sheena&#x27;s &quot;Sugoroku Ecstasy&quot; tour and is also featured on Sheena&#x27;s &quot;Electric Mole&quot; DVD.

Hiizumi and Hirama left Tokyo Jihen in July 2005, and the band selected two new members: , also known as , on guitar and backing vocals, and , also known as , on keyboards in September 2005. The band released its second album featuring the new lineup in January 2006 and played two concerts, at the Osaka-Jo Hall in Osaka and the Budokan in Tokyo, in February 2006.

=== Resumption of solo work ===
In late 2006, Ringo announced that she would resume work as a solo artist as the Music Director for the 2007 film &quot;Sakuran&quot;. The album &quot;Heisei Fūzoku&quot; (2007) is the soundtrack from this film. Violinist Neko Saitō and the band Soil &amp; &quot;Pimp&quot; Sessions appear on the album. A song featuring her and Soil, &quot;Karisome Otome (Death Jazz version)&quot; was released on iTunes Japan exclusively on November 11, 2006. It went to the top of the charts and remained there for days.

In June 2007, Sheena was asked to compose music for the kabuki &quot;Sannin Kichisa&quot; by Kanzaburo Nakamura, for which she composed the ending theme &quot;Tamatebako&quot; (玉手箱, &quot;Casket&quot;).

In September 2008, Sheena provided Japanese boy band Tokio with two songs for their singles.

In February 2009, Sheena had written music for Japanese rock duo Puffy AmiYumi. The duo&#x27;s member Ami was introduced to Sheena by Hikaru Utada. Ami is a fan of Sheena&#x27;s music, which amounted to their friendship together.

In March 2009, Sheena Ringo received the newcomer Fine Arts Award in the Popular Culture category from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. In May of the same year, Sheena released a solo single titled &quot;Ariamaru Tomi&quot;, which was used as the theme song for the TV drama &quot;Smile&quot;. In June, Sheena released her solo album titled &quot;Sanmon Gossip&quot; after a long hiatus. On December 2, 2009, Sheena released the single &quot;Nōdōteki Sanpunkan&quot; with Tokyo Jihen after an interval of about two years.

Sheena provided a cover of &quot;Uta&quot; for the January 29, 2020 Buck-Tick tribute album &quot;Parade III ~Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick~&quot;

== Singing and songwriting style ==
Sheena is an accomplished musician and songwriter who writes music spanning numerous genres. She is well known for her eccentricity, rolling her &quot;r&quot;s and creating promotional music videos with striking visuals.

She admired Eddi Reader&#x27;s voice, but felt her own voice was not as clear and sounded hoarse. She admired Janis Ian&#x27;s singing and wrote &quot;Seventeen&quot; in tribute to Ian&#x27;s &quot;At Seventeen&quot;. She later covered &quot;Love Is Blind&quot;. She listens to many genres of music. At the time of her debut, she had ten closely written pages of lists of her favorite musicians. They included various genres such as classical music, Japanese and American popular music from the 1950s and 1960s, contemporary rock, and the local band Fukuoka.

She mainly plays rhythm guitar, but she plays other musical instruments. During live shows she sometimes plays the piano and occasionally plays the bass guitar. While recording, she sometimes plays piano and drums, and occasionally uses uncommon musical instruments such as a melodica and a shamisen.

== Stage name ==
At her audition in 1996, she introduced herself as &quot;Sheena Ringo&quot; for the first time. &quot;Ringo&quot; means &quot;apple&quot; in Japanese. She said that &quot;Ringo&quot; originated from her class nickname when she often blushed in public, and from the Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr.

She declared recently that she followed the naming of the pen name of her favorite manga artist, Sensha Yoshida. His first name is just a name of an object like Ringo (&quot;Sensha&quot; in this case meaning a &quot;tank&quot; in English). She thought that those who heard her name would be shocked by that.

== In popular culture ==
The Duesenberg Starplayer guitar which Sheena has used recorded historical sales of around 1000 units in Japan in 2000.

Sheena&#x27;s name often appeared on the books, movies, TV dramas and songs, such as the Japanese movie &quot;All About Lily Chou-Chou&quot; (with The Beatles, Björk, and UA), Maximum the Hormone&#x27;s song &quot;Sheena basu tei de matsu.&quot;, Kreva&#x27;s single &quot;Idome&quot;, the Japanese movie &quot;Linda Linda Linda&quot;, the TV drama &quot;Furuhata Ninzaburō final series&quot;, the book by Taro Aso who is the 92nd Prime Minister of Japan &quot;Totetsumonai Nihon&quot; (as a singer representative of Jpop with Hikaru Utada).

I-No, a character from the fighting game series &quot;Guilty Gear&quot;, is modeled after Sheena, wields a similar guitar as a weapon, and shares her birthday.

&quot;Ariamaru Tomi&quot; is played in the ending sequence of the 2024 video game &quot;Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&quot;.

==Reception==
Lenny Kravitz stated that he admired Sheena&#x27;s music video and both her way of making music and the presentation, and said that he wanted to meet her in 2000.

When Courtney Love visited Japan in 2001, she was played CDs featuring Japanese female rock singers by the editor of &quot;Rockin&#x27;On&quot;, Yōichirō Yamazaki. From what she heard, Love expressed interest in Sheena and Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her, but was unsuccessful in her efforts to contact Sheena. 

British singer-songwriter Mika mentioned Sheena as one of his favorite Japanese artists (alongside Puffy AmiYumi, The Yellow Monkey, Yoko Kanno, and the Yoshida Brothers) in several interviews during his visit to Japan in 2007. Jack Barnett of These New Puritans, who was visiting Japan for the Summer Sonic 2008 festival, said in an interview that he was a great fan of Ringo Sheena and bought all her works while he was there, as they were not available in the United Kingdom.

Her third album, &quot;Kalk Samen Kuri no Hana&quot;, was ranked second in CNN International Asia&#x27;s list of &quot;the 2000s&#x27; most under-appreciated Japanese music of the last decade&quot; on December 22, 2009. Sheena also received a mention in The Guardian as one of Japan&#x27;s artists who &quot;deserve to be seen and heard in the west&quot; in 2010.

== Awards ==
== Personal life ==
Sheena was born with an esophageal atresia in which the esophagus narrows as it approaches the stomach. Treatment of this involved several operations, at least one of which required her right shoulder blade to be cut open. These surgeries left Sheena with large scars on her shoulder blades, said to give the impression that an angel&#x27;s wings had been removed.

Sheena&#x27;s older brother Junpei Shiina is an R&amp;B musician, who debuted in 2000 under Sony. Since 2006, he has been managed by Kronekodow, Sheena&#x27;s personal management agency. The pair have collaborated musically several times. In 2002, they covered three songs in English: Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;The Onion Song&quot; for Sheena&#x27;s album &quot;Utaite Myōri&quot;, &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; (originally performed by Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway) for Junpei Shiina&#x27;s album &quot;Discover&quot;, and Toto&#x27;s &quot;Georgy Porgy&quot;. The latter one was recorded as a part of a special unit called Yokoshima, featuring Jumpei Shiina on keyboards and Ringo Sheena on chorus. In 2007, the pair sang a duet on her single &quot;Kono Yo no Kagiri&quot;.

In November 2000, Sheena married guitarist Junji Yayoshi, who was a member of her backing band Gyakutai Glycogen. Sheena gave birth to a son in July 2001. The pair then later divorced in January 2002.

In September 2013, gossip magazine &quot;Josei Jishin&quot; published an article that linked her romantically with music director Yuichi Kodama and stating that she was secretly giving birth to her second child. Sheena addressed these rumours publicly during her &quot;Tōtaikai&quot; concerts in November 2013, announcing that she gave birth in spring of 2013 to a girl. As this was close to the release of her single &quot;Irohanihoheto/Kodoku no Akatsuki&quot;, she did not feel it was appropriate to link the birth of her daughter with single promotions, so decided not to announce it at the time. The footage of her announcement was released on her &quot;Tōtaikai&quot; DVD in March 2014.

== Controversy ==
In November 2022, Sheena and her record label EMI Records received criticism for the artwork of her remix album, &quot;Hyakuyaku no Chō&quot;. The artwork of the remix album as well as bonus goods from the Universal Music store included a logo bearing similarity to the Red Cross emblem. Universal Music Japan, the distributor of EMI, released a press announcement on their website apologizing for the usage of the medical cross. Universal Japan announced that the release would be postponed while the company revised the design of the album and bonus goods. While the album was released digitally on its originally planned release date, November 30, a physical CD version of the album was not released until January 13, 2023.

<text>Gary Jennings (September 20, 1928 – February 13, 1999) was an American author who wrote children&#x27;s and adult novels. In 1980, after the successful novel &quot;Aztec&quot;, he specialized in writing adult historical fiction novels.

==Biography==
Born September 20, 1928, in Buena Vista, Virginia, to Glen Edward and Vaughnye May Jennings, Gary Jennings attended little formal school after graduating from Eastside High School (of &quot;Lean on Me&quot; fame) in Paterson, New Jersey, and was mostly self-educated thereafter.

His novels were known for their historical detail and occasionally graphic content. Jennings&#x27;s novels are well-researched: he lived for 12 years in Mexico to research the Aztec novels, traveled the Balkans while researching &quot;Raptor&quot;, and joined nine circus troupes during the writing of &quot;Spangle&quot;. He also produced a number of novels for younger readers, such as &quot;A Rope in the Jungle&quot;, and a history of the occult, titled &quot;Black Magic, White Magic.&quot;

Gary Jennings died in February 1999 in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey, aged 70, from heart failure.

<doc id="669046" wikidata="Q7525777" url="?curid=669046" title="Siphuncle">
<text>The siphuncle is a strand of tissue passing longitudinally through the shell of a cephalopod mollusc. Only cephalopods with chambered shells have siphuncles, such as the extinct ammonites and belemnites, and the living nautiluses, cuttlefish, and &quot;Spirula&quot;. In the case of the cuttlefish, the siphuncle is indistinct and connects all the small chambers of that animal&#x27;s highly modified shell; in the other cephalopods it is thread-like and passes through small openings in the septa (walls) dividing the camerae (chambers). Some older studies have used the term siphon for the siphuncle, though this naming convention is uncommon in modern studies to prevent confusion with a mollusc organ of the same name.

== Function ==
The siphuncle is used primarily in emptying water from new chambers as the shell grows. To perform this task, the cephalopod increases the saltiness of the blood in the siphuncle, and the water moves from the more dilute chamber into the blood through osmosis. At the same time gasses, mostly nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, diffuse from the blood in the siphuncle into the emptying chamber. This is not a form of active pumping: the gas moving into the chamber is a passive process. Most energy is expended through the absorption of water from the chamber.

Removing water from the chambers of the shell reduces the overall density of the shell, and thus the shell behaves as a flotation device comparable to the swim bladder in bony fish. Typically, cephalopods maintain a density close to that of sea water, allowing them to keep a stable buoyancy with minimal effort. In the geologic past, many cephalopods grew to an enormous size (perhaps approaching ten meters in length) thanks to this.

Generally, the siphuncle is unable to provide a way to change the density of shell rapidly and thus cause the animal to rise or sink at will; rather, the animal must swim up or down as required.

Cephalopods with a wider siphuncle have a higher rate of metabolic activity.

== Morphology ==

The siphuncle of fossilised cephalopods is assumed to have worked in the same general way as in living nautiluses. The siphuncle itself is only rarely preserved, but its shape can be inferred from hardened structures which lie around it. Many fossils show the holes where the siphuncle passes through each septum. Around these holes, the rim of the septum is bent into a stout aragonitic tube known as a septal neck (or siphuncle notch).

In each chamber of the shell, the siphuncle is encased by a tubular structure known as a connecting ring. In living nautiluses, the connecting ring is a simple, thin-walled cylinder, with organic or thinly calcitic layers secreted from the tissues of the siphuncle. This fragile and poorly-mineralized form is known as a &quot;nautilosiphonate&quot; morphology. Many extinct cephalopods have a much more prominent connecting ring, with a very thick and porous inner calcitic layer. This more strongly-mineralized form is known as a &quot;calciosiphonate&quot; connecting ring. Connecting rings are strongly variable in morphology, from narrow homogenous tubes to bulbous, segmented cavities. Some are infolded, sending lobes or blades of calcite into the siphuncle. Connecting rings are typically continuous with the septal necks, and are difficult to distinguish without close examination. However, their developmental origin is wholly separate from the shell and septa, and they utilize calcite rather than aragonite as a biomineralized reinforcement.

Biomineralized structures which develop within the siphuncle are known as endosiphuncular deposits (or simply siphonal deposits). These may include horizontal partitions (&quot;diaphragms&quot;), stacked conical structures (&quot;endocones&quot;), longitudinal rods, and various other concretions. Endosiphuncular deposits are typically thin structures which may be homologous to parts of the septae or connecting rings.

In most fossil nautiluses, the siphuncle runs more or less through the center of each chamber, but in ammonites and belemnites it usually runs along the ventral edge of the shell. In some fossil straight shelled nautiloids, cylindrical calcareous growths (&quot;siphuncular deposits&quot;) around the siphuncle can be seen towards the apex of the shell. These were apparently counterweights for the soft body at the other end of the shell, and allowed the nautilus to swim in a horizontal position. Without these deposits, the apex of the buoyant shell would have pointed upwards and the heavier body downwards, making horizontal swimming difficult. The siphuncle of the Endocerida also contained much of the organisms&#x27; body organs.

<text>Camilo Ernesto Mejía (born August 28, 1975) is a Nicaraguan who left the United States Army during the Iraq War on conscientious objector grounds, was convicted of desertion and went on to become an anti-war activist.

==Service and court-martial==
Mejía is a graduate of the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where he majored in psychology and Spanish. Mejía spent six months in Iraq (his first and only combat tour). Mejia returned to the United States on a 2-week furlough in order to address an issue with his Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status; after which he did not return for duty. He was charged with desertion and sentenced to one year in prison for refusing to return to fight in Iraq. In March 2004, he turned himself in to the US military and filed an application for conscientious objector status.

On May 21, 2004, Mejía was convicted of desertion by a military jury and sentenced to one year confinement, reduction to the rank of Private E-1, and a Bad Conduct Discharge.

Mejía served his sentence at the Fort Sill military prison in Lawton, Oklahoma. During his time in custody, he was recognized by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience and was awarded by Refuse and Resist with its Courageous Resister Award. He was also the recipient of the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award which was presented by his attorney Louis Font. Camilo was recognized by the Detroit, Michigan, City Council with a commendation for his stand.

==After prison==
Camilo Mejía was released from prison on February 15, 2005. Since his release, he has spoken at many peace protests and to the press about his experiences and his opposition to the war in Iraq. In 2005, he was recognized with the &#x27;Young Leader Award&#x27; by Global Exchange, in San Francisco.

In August 2005, Camilo along with Desert Storm Veteran Dennis Kyne, stormed President Bush&#x27;s vacation ranch house with Cindy Sheehan and future members of Camp Casey. 

Mejía has recently written a book entitled &quot;Road from Ar Ramadi: The Private Rebellion of Staff Sergeant Mejía&quot; which recounts his journey of conscience in Iraq.

Mejía is interviewed in &quot;The Ground Truth: After the Killing Ends (2006)&quot;, a documentary about the training and alleged dehumanization of U.S. soldiers, and how they struggle to come to terms with it when they come back home. In August 2007, Mejía was named the chair of the board of directors of Iraq Veterans Against the War.

==Song about Mejía==
In early 2006, alternative reggae/rock band State Radio released the album &quot;Us Against the Crown&quot;, which features the song &quot;Camilo&quot;. When they heard of his story, State Radio wanted to bring conscientious objection to light. Lyrics in the song reflect on Camilo Mejía&#x27;s situation:
Twenty days in a concrete fallout/ What life have I to take your own/ Oh my country, won&#x27;t you call out/ Doorbells are ringing with boxes of bones/ And from another land&#x27;s war torn corners/ To a prison cell in my own/ Punish me for not taking your orders/ But don&#x27;t lock me up for not leavin&#x27; my home Camilo/ Camilo/ Leaving my home/ Camilo/ Camilo

<doc id="669074" wikidata="Q1049555" url="?curid=669074" title="Feeder (band)">
<text>Feeder are a Welsh rock band formed in Newport, South Wales in 1994. They have released 12 studio albums, 12 compilations, four EPs, and 43 singles while accumulating 25 top 75 singles between 1997 and 2012. At the peak of their commercial success, Feeder won two Kerrang! Awards in 2001 and 2003 and were inducted into their Hall of Fame in August 2019.
Feeder are one of the prominent acts of the ‘Cool Cymru’ movement in Wales in the 1990s. Their 2024 album &quot;Black/Red&quot; debuted at number eight, three decades after the group formed, and 25 years after their first top 10 album &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot;. The band are also one of the most charted in UK sales history, with 40 Top 75 singles and albums combined across both charts.

The band was formed in 1994, although an earlier incarnation under the name of &quot;Reel&quot; was formed in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band&#x27;s other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1994 and re-establishing themselves as Feeder; that year, the band signed with The Echo Label.

Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, &quot;Echo Park&quot;, and its lead single, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, which later became a UK top five Platinum-selling single. Jon Lee died by suicide at his Miami home in January 2002, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;, later that year; it touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder have since worked with a roster of drummers live and in the studio, including Tim Trotter, Karl Brazil and former Elviss drummer Geoff Holroyde. Between 2010 and 2017, the band charted four more top 20 albums, with the latest of these being 2017&#x27;s &quot;The Best of Feeder&quot; their second consecutive top 10 album. In 2019, the band signed a deal with Believe UK to release their tenth studio album, &quot;Tallulah&quot;. The band released their eleventh studio album, titled &quot;Torpedo&quot;, in 2022. Their twelfth studio album, a double album titled &quot;Black/Red&quot;, was released in 2024.

In 1994, Reel/Real&#x27;s bass player, Julian Smith, left the group. Grant Nicholas and Jon Lee went &#x27;back to the drawing board&#x27;. They placed an advert in &quot;Loot&quot; for a new bass player. The advert was answered by Taka Hirose, a Japanese ex-pat working in London as a graphic designer. The trio changed their name to Feeder, after Nicholas&#x27;s pet goldfish. In 1994, Feeder sent a demo tape to The Echo Label. Representatives at Echo listened to the tape, sent an employee to see the band play live, then offered them a record contract.

In 1995, Feeder recorded their first EP, &quot;Two Colours.&quot; Limited to 1,500 CDs and 1,000 7&quot; vinyl singles, the band sold &quot;Two Colours&quot; at gigs. 1996 was an eventful year for Feeder. In February, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Edge&quot; gave away a promo tape the band made with producer Chris Sheldon. Called &#x27;Two Tracker&#x27;, it featured two songs that would feature on Feeder&#x27;s debut album. In July, Feeder released their first commercially available release, &quot;Swim.&quot; In August, the band made their first appearance at the Reading festival and in October, they released their first single, &quot;Stereo World&quot;.

=== &quot;Polythene&quot; and &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot; (1997–1999) ===
Feeder&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Polythene&quot;, was released in May 1997. &quot;Polythene&quot; was acclaimed by critics, including &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, who placed the album at first and sixth in their respective end-of-year lists. Some critics labelled the band &quot;The UK&#x27;s answer to the Smashing Pumpkins&quot;, and also drew comparisons to The Pixies and Talk Talk.

Feeder would go on to release three further singles from &quot;Polythene&quot;, &quot;Tangerine&quot; (charting at No. 60 in the UK singles chart.) and &quot;Cement&quot; (No. 53), &quot;Crash&quot; (No. 48). In October 1997, Feeder released their breakthrough single &quot;High&quot;, which charted at No. 24. They also reissued &quot;Polythene&quot;, adding &quot;High&quot; to the track listing, along with some other changes.

In early 1998 Feeder toured the United States as a support act for Everclear. During their tour, the band released a re-worked version of &quot;Suffocate&quot; for UK release, which charted at No. 37. After their return to the UK, they played their own headline tour with Everclear in support. They stayed in the US for most of the year, playing various music festivals alongside a headline tour with &quot;High&quot;, which had been released to radio stations and charted at No. 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The band travelled back to the UK to play at V98.

In March 1999, Feeder returned with a new single, &quot;Day In Day Out&quot;, which charted at No. 31. Two more singles followed, &quot;Insomnia&quot; in May (charting at No. 22 and resulting in their first appearance on Top of the Pops) and &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot; in August (charting at No. 20). That summer, Feeder added guitarist Dean Tidey to their live band. They performed on the main stage of the Reading and Leeds festivals.

The album Yesterday Went Too Soon was released on 30 August. &quot;Yesterday Went Too Soon&quot; entered the UK albums chart at No. 8, an unexpected position for the band.

The UK music press warmed to the album. It was &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s &quot;Album of the Week&quot; (and later No. 24 album of 1999), while &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; placed the album in at No. 6 and &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked it at No. 16. As of March 2003, the album has been certified gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK, with total counter sales standing at 110,000 as of February 2005.

In November, Feeder released a final single from the album, a re-recorded version of &quot;Paperfaces&quot;, which charted at No. 41. The year ended with the band supporting the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena and Manic Street Preachers at the Millennium Stadium.

=== &quot;Echo Park&quot; and mainstream breakthrough (2000–2001) ===
Feeder spent most of 2000 writing and recording for their next album. They previewed new material at festivals around the country, including V2000 and Glastonbury. They would end the year promoting &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, their first single since November 1999 and then playing a mini-tour at the end of the year to mainly showcase the new material. The release of the single on 8 January 2001 was coupled with a signing session at London&#x27;s now defunct Tower Records store and then a TV appearance on &quot;Top of The Pops&quot; before the single charted. The single charted at number five, becoming the band&#x27;s first top 10 entry in the singles chart before appearing on Top of the Pops again. &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; then spent a second week in the top 10.

Grant wrote &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; with The Pixies as an influence, but &quot;on a comic book level&quot;. He had originally written the track for another band with whom &quot;Echo Park&quot; producer Gil Norton was working, but decided not to give it away, for he felt Feeder themselves could have a hit with it. &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; still receives regular airplay on alternative radio stations in the United Kingdom. &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s writers also approved of the track as one of their &quot;666 Songs You Must Own&quot;, when it appeared at No. 5 in their rock songs list in November 2004.

After a sell-out tour of two legs ending at the London Astoria, the album &quot;Echo Park&quot; entered at number five in the UK album charts, shortly after &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single charted at No. 14. Shortly before the single&#x27;s release, the band&#x27;s rise up to the mainstream was recognised by the now defunct Scottish Television live music show &quot;Boxed Set&quot;, where a half-hour-long live-set with a studio audience was played. A third single, &quot;Turn&quot; reached No. 27 in July before festival season. &quot;Just a Day&quot;, a b-side from &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot;, later reached No. 12 in December. The response the album received on a critical level was mixed, with Dan Genroe of &quot;Q&quot; magazine claiming that the listener will still be &quot;feeling hungry half an hour later&quot;, alongside suggesting that the album is &quot;hard to love&quot;. Ben Myers of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave the album 4/5 (KKKK) which indicates &quot;blinding&quot;, while citing that the band &quot;hit their stride&quot; on the album, alongside suggesting that the album is &quot;fat free and stripped to the bone&quot;.

The album saw the band adopt a more &#x27;commercial&#x27; sound, also incorporating synthesizers. Lyrically, &quot;Echo Park&quot; contains both a comedic approach, as with &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot;, and dark emotions, such as those shown on &quot;Turn&quot;, &quot;Oxygen&quot;, and &quot;Satellite News&quot;. It was during the campaign for &quot;Echo Park&quot; that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading and Leeds festival, including T in the Park. As of August 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK going platinum, with counter sales standing at 293,000 as of February 2005. Grant said in a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview that if the album did not sell well enough the band would probably split up; he said at the time that &quot;It&#x27;s the same with any band. That&#x27;s just the way the music business is. There is only a certain amount of money a label will put into a band. I&#x27;m just being realistic. We&#x27;ve been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we&#x27;re putting everything into this record and I&#x27;m just hoping that people like it&quot;. The album campaign helped the band in August 2001 win the &quot;Best British Live Act&quot; accolade at the Kerrang! awards, before ending the year supporting the Stereophonics, and then releasing the &quot;Just a Day&quot; single in December. In July 2024, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; gained a platinum certification for 600,000 physical sales, digital downloads and streaming points combined. One year prior to this, &quot;Just a Day&quot; also passed 400,000 sales to be certified gold.

In July 2001, Feeder&#x27;s EP &quot;Swim&quot; was re-released with extra tracks, being a selection of b-sides from their earlier singles, alongside the videos for the &quot;Polythene&quot; singles &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Cement&quot;. Overall unit sales for &quot;Swim&quot; stand at 40,000 as of February 2005.

=== Jon Lee&#x27;s death and &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; (2002–2003) ===
In January 2002, Jon Lee died at home in Miami. The band kept out of the public eye for most of the year. It was during this time that lead-singer Grant Nicholas wrote a series of songs relating to their emotions and reactions to Jon&#x27;s death, which formed their fourth album &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;. The band brought in former Skunk Anansie and Little Angels drummer Mark Richardson, whom Grant first met in 1994, when Feeder went on tour with Richardson&#x27;s then-band, B.l.o.w.

The album focused mainly on themes such as loss, depression, grief and positivity, while dedicating &quot;Quickfade&quot; to Jon. The album was released in October of the same year to widespread critical acclaim in the British music press, with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; alongside the heavy rock magazine &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; giving the album their respective &quot;Album of the Week&quot; accolades. The band were invited to the Reading and Leeds festivals that year, headlining the second stage at Reading on the first day which took place on 23 August, before heading off to Leeds the next. Grant also mentioned that at the time their fourth album already had a series of backing tracks recorded, with a total of 15 when recording is completed with then 10 chosen for the final album, when the final track listing was revealed, this was increased to 12. The album is currently Feeder&#x27;s best-seller with an estimated 503,706 units sold as of April 2012. The album charted at No. 98 in Japan and No. 28 in Ireland, beating the peak position of No. 57 that &quot;Echo Park&quot; managed during the previous year. In Japan, it would be the first time Feeder ever charted there. The album charted at number six in the UK.

Musically, &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; is mellower than Feeder&#x27;s previous albums, with the use of a string orchestra on &quot;Forget About Tomorrow&quot;, while other tracks on the album also used an accordion, trumpet, and a piano played by their manager Matt Page, with &quot;Godzilla&quot; being one of two tracks on the album to use loud guitars. The album was their first release to be certified platinum, (with &quot;Echo Park&quot; going platinum later on). It also spawned their second top 10 single, with &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; in January 2003. In December of the same year they took on their only arena tour, after the album&#x27;s first nationwide tour was a sell out with 50,000 tickets sold, and visited 21 different towns and cities in the United Kingdom over 23 different dates. In reaction to this, the band were invited to the Glastonbury Festival being placed third on the last day, playing the &quot;Pyramid Stage&quot;. Shortly after the release of the single, the band were invited to support Coldplay on their UK and Europeean tour, due to their frontman Chris Martin often saying how much he liked the &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; album and their live shows. Their show at the Birmingham National Indoor Arena was reviewed by &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, which seen Steve Beebee give the band 4/5 (KKKK) for their performance.

The album&#x27;s final single, the title track, was only available to buy as a limited edition of 3,000 CDs on their 2003 arena tour. Four singles were released commercially, with those being &quot;Come Back Around&quot; (No. 14), &quot;Just the Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; (No. 10), &quot;Forget About Tomorrow&quot; (No. 12), and &quot;Find the Colour&quot; (No. 24), which was released following their V2003 appearance and Kerrang! award win for &quot;Best British Band&quot;, beating competition from Muse and the Stereophonics, which Grant dedicated to Jon saying it was the award he had always wanted the band to win. The band later went on to win an Internet Music Award for their &quot;Just The Way I&#x27;m Feeling&quot; video, while the album became their first to appear on the end of year top 75 album charts, appearing at No. 66. The album&#x27;s commercial reception helped Echo experience their most successful financial year. Feeder then received their only nomination to date at The BRIT Awards, in which they appeared in the &quot;Best British Rock&quot; category at the 2004 event, before making their only appearance in the charts that year as part of Bob Geldof&#x27;s Band Aid 20 charity ensemble. The single was the Christmas number one, and became the year&#x27;s biggest-selling UK single. Alongside only making one singles chart appearance in 2004, Feeder also only made one live appearance during the year as part of the &quot;Carling Live 24&quot; event, playing their show at the Hammersmith Apollo on 1 May.

=== &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot; (2004–2005) ===

Feeder returned to the studio to record their fifth album &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot;. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;, as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, and also said that it had more of an organic sound, with more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It contains a number of piano-driven tracks, &quot;Frequency&quot; being an example. &quot;Frequency&quot; was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson, while for the rest of the album, Gil Norton was on production duties. Grant told &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in May 2004, &quot;I&#x27;ve done some recording on my own in a little studio up by where I live in North London. I demo the album in its full form before the rest of the band play on it. Its difficult to know at this stage what it will turn out like, but so far its slightly more mature sounding&quot;. Grant later added &quot;Each album is a journey and a reflection of the past, there is some stuff that touches on what has happened, but there are songs about love, songs of loss and songs about the future. I don&#x27;t want to give too much away but there&#x27;s one track called &quot;Bitter Glass&quot;. Its quite dark but uplifting too. Its about pulling yourself out of a big hole&quot;.

The album was Feeder&#x27;s highest-charting release, at number two on the UK album chart selling 42,951 units in its first week, while receiving a gold certification, and becoming a top 100 album in six other countries. Press response to the album was mixed. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; were brutal towards the band for all of their review, with Ben Meyers referring to them as a &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot;, including comparisons to a &quot;Pastel box&quot;. Grant later said in a documentary with &quot;Kerrang! Radio&quot; that he was &quot;pissed off&quot; with the review their magazine counterpart gave them, while citing &quot;It was a very unfair review and reviewed by the wrong person&quot;.

The album helped them secure a headline slot at 2005&#x27;s Download Festival. Shortly afterwards, Feeder supported U2 for a brief period on their &quot;Vertigo Tour&quot;, then played at the &quot;Live 8&quot; concert in Edinburgh (the second charity event the band played that year after &quot;Tsunami Relief Cardiff&quot;).

The campaign in total spawned four UK top 40 singles, which included &quot;Shatter&quot;, a reworked version of the &quot;Tumble and Fall&quot; b-side that became a double A-side with &quot;Tender&quot; (#11), released following a fan-petition to see &quot;Shatter&quot; released as a single in its own right. Other singles included &quot;Tumble and Fall&quot; (top five), &quot;Feeling A Moment&quot; (No. 13), and &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot; (No. 30). The album was after ten weeks on sales of 111,214 units, 22 percent ahead of &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; at that stage. However, the album did not keep up this momentum while also not going platinum. The last reported sales were that of 160,183 in October of the same year, which fell below Echo&#x27;s expectations. It is however the band&#x27;s most successful record based on peak chart positions in each country of release, while also being their only album so far to spawn a charting single outside of the UK and Ireland when &quot;Feeling a Moment&quot; peaked at No. 32 in Australia. Feeder already at the time charted four top 50 singles in Ireland, with &quot;Tumble and Fall&quot; being their first and only top 40 to date reaching a peak position of No. 26. The album itself made the Irish top 20 artist album chart at No. 16, one week before its UK release.

Feeder would end the year seeing their then latest album appear at No. 39 on &quot;Q&quot;″s end-of-year list, with &quot;Feeling a Moment&quot; voted the 98th best song of the year by its readers. However, on 3 December 2005, they were forced to postpone a winter tour, after Grant picked up bleeds on his vocal cords the night before during a gig in Brighton, causing the show to be abandoned and later rescheduled along with the rest of the outstanding dates. During the year, Feeder&#x27;s domestic studio album sales passed the one million units mark.

=== &quot;The Singles&quot; and &quot;Silent Cry&quot; (2006–2008) ===
In late 2005, Feeder already returned to the studio, with Stephen Street working as the band&#x27;s producer to record three new tracks to appear on their then forthcoming singles collection. &quot;Lost and Found&quot; (which Grant described as &quot;an urban love song&quot;) became the first single to promote the collection, and reached No. 12 in the UK singles chart in May 2006, after completing their delayed winter tour, which ended at the LG Arena in Birmingham in front of 8,000 fans. &quot;The Singles&quot;, released in the same month as &quot;Lost and Found&quot;, was the first Feeder album to have involvement from a major label, with EMI taking part in a one-off collaboration with Echo as the album&#x27;s distributor. The album reached number two on the UK albums chart with first week sales of 50,003 entering at number three, and was certified platinum in under three months, with a total of 497,700 units sold as of April 2012, including a gold certification in Ireland after charting at No. 13. The album also made the top ten in Europe with a debut top 40 peak in Japan at No. 37, while &quot;Save Us&quot; was its second and final single in the UK, charting at No. 34 in late July. A version of the album included a DVD of all their videos filmed up to that point, along with extensive sleevenotes by Ben Johncock. The album became only their second to appear on the end of year top 75 this time at No. 48, while becoming their first album to spend more than one week on the top 10. Sales of &quot;The Singles&quot;, alongside a series of changes at Echo making them into an &quot;Incubator label&quot;, enabled the company to report a &quot;modest profit&quot; for 2006. Feeder returned to the Reading and Leeds festivals after a four-year break, having a late slot on the main stage, before ending the year with a small tour of London, playing The Roundhouse, and The Coronet. These were in aid of War Child who the band are patrons of, having earlier in the year visited The Congo as part of their work for the charity. Although their appearances at The Roundhouse would be their first two, their appearance at The Coronet would be their first and last as it was later demolished in 2021.

In 2006 Feeder announced in an interview with &quot;XFM&quot; that their next album would be reminiscent of their earlier material. They spent most of 2007 recording, with the resulting album &quot;Silent Cry&quot; being released on 16 June 2008. On balance, the album received moderate reviews. While some like &quot;The Guardian&quot; were negative towards the album, others like &quot;Rock Louder&quot; were more positive. On its release week the album charted at number eight with sales of 16,029. In its second week the album then fell to number 30, with a third week drop to number 60 before leaving the top 75 albums listing. In Japan it peaked at No. 53, which is currently higher than any of their studio albums, but lower than the peak of &quot;The Singles&quot;. Before the release of the album, &quot;We Are the People&quot; charted at No. 25 in the singles chart, making it their lowest chart position for a lead single since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Day in Day Out&quot;. &quot;Miss You&quot; from the album was given away by the band&#x27;s official website as a free download in April, and gained over 8,000 downloads on its first day of release. As of December 2008, sales of &quot;Silent Cry&quot; stand at less than 50,000 units, less than was what hoped for by their label. Shortly after the album was released, the band recorded a cover of Public Image Ltd&#x27;s 1978 self-titled single &quot;Public Image&quot;, for a compilation album to celebrate &quot;Independents Day&quot; which celebrated independently released music. The second single from &quot;Silent Cry&quot; was Feeder&#x27;s first download-only single, consisting of &quot;Tracing Lines&quot; and the album&#x27;s title track which failed to make the charts.

In May 2008, the band played an eight-date tour to promote &quot;Silent Cry&quot;. Tickets sold out in six hours. These dates was followed by a one-off gig on 12 June at the Proud Galleries in Camden, which sold out in six minutes. The band then went on to play at the iTunes festival in July, which saw a live six-track EP release of their performance, before playing the 2008 Reading and Leeds festivals in August, on the main stage. In July the band played at T in the Park, with an appearance at the Isle of Wight Festival the month previous. In 2008, the band also introduced live keyboard player Dean Deavall, of the band Casino. During the same year, on 25 October at 06:00 GMT after playing the Glasgow Barrowlands as part of their 29-date UK tour, the band&#x27;s crew bus caught fire on the M62 motorway whilst travelling between Glasgow and Lincoln, destroying it and the crew&#x27;s personal items. It was also announced by Chrysalis later on in the year, that Echo have been restructured into a copyright exploitation company, in which its main duty is maintaining the copyright on existing releases while no longer releasing any new records or signing any more artists. As a result, Feeder were until 2010 no longer on a record contract in their own country, while still being signed to their Japanese label Victor and Play it Again Sam (PIAS), their European label. Their 2008 UK tour, seen their first ever gig in Loughbrough, and their last show at the London Astoria on 18 November 2008. The venue was later torn down in early 2009 and was also their last show as an Echo Label artist.

After ending their tour at the Portsmouth Pyramids Centre, a six track EP titled &quot;Seven Sleepers&quot; was released in Japan, the same time they toured there in March. It included a collection of B-sides from the &quot;Silent Cry&quot; album, plus two new songs.

=== Mark Richardson&#x27;s and Dean Tidey&#x27;s departures and &quot;Renegades&quot; (2009–10) ===
After starting 2009 with two warm-up shows for their tour of Japan in Scarborough and Crewe (which was a rescheduled gig from the previous tour and had appeared on early promotional posters), the band later on in May announced that Feeder had &quot;ended their partnership&quot; with drummer Mark Richardson, who returned to his original band Skunk Anansie. Mark was replaced by session drummer Karl Brazil who had just come off tour with James Blunt, and had also played drums for British band Ben&#x27;s Brother. Karl&#x27;s first live appearances with the band, after a series of university events were at the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival, stating that this would be their only UK festival appearance of 2009, as they would be working on their seventh studio album. It was then later announced that they would be appearing at the Hevy Music Festival in Folkestone. Here they previewed a new track titled &quot;Sentimental&quot;, with the announcement that they had been in a recording studio in South Wales.

At first, Tim Trotter then of Mexicolas was filling in on drum duties in the studio also as a session drummer, before Karl stepped in. With Karl playing drums for Robbie Williams, Natalie Imbruglia and Ben&#x27;s Brother, Tim once again took over drum duties in the studio. On 2 December, the band&#x27;s official webpage was changed to display the word &quot;RENEGADES&quot; and the names of each of the band members by their surname, with &quot;BRAZIL&quot; mentioned amongst these. On 17 December a sample of a new song &quot;Sentimental&quot; was added to their website, which was later replaced with a 20-second clip of another song called &quot;Renegades&quot;. Later on that month the website announced a six date tour and the release of a tour-only EP which was released on &quot;Big Teeth Music&quot;, also their own record label. After the tour was completed, another six date tour was shortly announced with the band this time playing bigger venues. Another EP was released to coincide with the tour, which included a further four new songs with one of these being titled &quot;Home&quot;; one of the new songs the band performed on their first tour under this alias. The side-project was used as a method to promote the seventh Feeder studio album titled &quot;Renegades&quot; at live shows where they would mainly play the new songs, thus avoiding having to play any of their hits if they played as Feeder. The side-project would cease in 2010 after playing their final gig as Renegades at that year&#x27;s Sonisphere Festival.

In an April 2010 interview with South Yorkshire newspaper &quot;The Star&quot;, Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band&#x27;s sudden increase in success and awareness, in which he claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues. The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut. Looking back on this version of the band, Grant Nicholas explained in an interview with Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. Some people thought it was a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing &quot;Feeder&quot; on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.

After completing their second and final tour as Renegades, the band then announced their new single &quot;Call Out&quot; under the name of Feeder before shortly revealing the name of their seventh album as &quot;Renegades&quot;. All of the new songs performed live as Renegades were listed on the album; the free download track &quot;Fallen&quot; was a B-side on &quot;Call Out&quot; and was released as a download and vinyl single, the album being released on 5 July. &quot;Renegades&quot; peaked at No. 16 on the UK album chart, giving them their seventh top 20 album with sales of 8,729, before being followed-up by the single release of the title track, also only on vinyl and download. In Japan, the album charted at No. 93, making it their least successful since &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;. Dean Deavall then departed from Casino to concentrate more on his time with Feeder, including his own band The High Hurts, while live band guitarist Dean Tidey in 2009 departed the band with the reasons disclosed. His final show with the band would later turn out to be at the Sonisphere Festival on the 5 August 2009. The album received mostly favourable reviews, although some critics as Will Dean of BBC Online did not praise the album giving it a mixed response

After a tour of Japan which saw Luna Sea guitarist Inoran join them on stage at the Daikanyama Unit for a performance of &quot;Breed&quot; (originally recorded by Nirvana), Feeder returned to the UK for a sell-out tour in late October which started at the Leeds Metropolitan University, before ending at Southampton University. This was followed by a small tour of Europe, South Africa and Australia, before a brief return to the UK ended their year. &quot;Down to the River / This Town&quot; also became the final single from the album, released only as a download and vinyl on 6 December.

===&quot;Side By Side&quot; and &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot; (2011–2012)===
In 2010, a number of tracks were left off the Renegades album before then being considered for inclusion for the follow-up.

In March 2011, Feeder released &quot;Side by Side&quot;, a download-only single in aid of the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. &quot;Side by Side&quot; charted at No. 91, Across 2011, Feeder played a number of shows with Damon Wilson on drums. On 30 January, &quot;Borders&quot; was released on CD, on 7&quot; vinyl and on cassette – the first time Feeder released a cassette single since 2001&#x27;s &quot;Just a Day&quot;. &quot;Borders&quot; charted at No. 52, giving the band their 25th top 75 single and their first official chart visit since 2008&#x27;s &quot;We Are the People&quot;.

&quot;Generation Freakshow&quot; was released on 23 April 2012. The critical response was mixed. BBC Music praised the album, while &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, despite negative reviews in the past, credited Feeder for creating another strong addition to their back catalogue. The album, which was released to coincide with a week-long tour, improved upon the response of &quot;Renegades&quot; by charting at No. 13, which increased the band&#x27;s UK album charts span to fifteen years, while selling 7,338 units in the same week. In Japan, &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot; improved upon the chart position of &quot;Renegades&quot;, when it entered at No. 57 and became their most successful studio album in almost four years. Retrospectively, this album alongside &quot;Renegades&quot;, has been seen as a commercial failure.

The week after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;Children of the Sun&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s second single. It did not chart. The album&#x27;s title track was due to be a single, but was later pulled despite promotional CDs already being pressed and sent to radio. &quot;Idaho&quot; became the third single from the album, released on 27 August. Like &quot;Children of the Sun&quot;, it also failed to chart.

The band later announced a tour to complete their year, which would end at the Brixton Academy. It was at this Brixton show on the 23rd November 2012, Nicholas repeated on stage a statement he made months prior to the tour, being that the band were going to take a break and decide on what to do next. This caused a joint misinterpretation, suggesting either that the band were going to later split up, or were going to re-evaluate their musical direction. The commercial failure of the album was a contributing factor to the decision to take a break, before releasing their comeback album in 2016. In the meantime Feeder would in 2013 play at Reading University as a private event, before Nicholas embarked on a two year solo career. It was before Nicholas began his solo career that he announced &quot;Feeder&#x27;s heart still beats strong&quot;.

===&quot;All Bright Electric&quot; and &quot;Tallulah&quot; (2016–2021)===
On 15 June the band released &quot;Universe of Life&quot;, the lead single for &quot;All Bright Electric&quot;, which was released on 7 October 2016. This was followed on 26 August by the single &quot;Eskimo&quot;, along with its music video. Both singles were released free for people who pre-ordered the album. After the band completed their UK tour between September and October 2016, &quot;All Bright Electric&quot; saw Feeder return to the top 10 of the album chart after an eight-year absence.

In July 2017, the band announced the compilation &quot;The Best of Feeder&quot;, featuring all the previous singles from the band&#x27;s career, as well a mini-album of new material within called &quot;Arrow&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Figure You Out&quot;, was released on 20 July 2017. The compilation later charted at No. 10 on the albums chart, giving Feeder their second album to chart in the upper tier in less than a calendar year.

On 9 August 2019, Feeder released their tenth studio album, &quot;Tallulah&quot;, before releasing a non-album single, &quot;Criminal&quot; on 1 November of that same year. Although this single failed to chart, the album became the band&#x27;s most successful studio album in 14 years, due to charting at No.4 on the UK album chart on its release week. Reviews were limited, but four out of the five it received from major sources were positive.

===&quot;Torpedo&quot; (2022–2023)===
After the success of &quot;Tallulah&quot; Nicholas and Hirose immediately began work on a follow up album. The two wrote and recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material across late 2019 and early 2020, with the album being largely complete outside of final audio mixing. However, progress halted with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Frustrated, Nicholas and Hirose turned to writing further material instead. Early sessions written during the COVID lockdown were slow, with Nicholas suffering with a case of writer&#x27;s block. Eventually, his pent up frustration with both the state of the world, and his writer&#x27;s block, lead to an outpouring of content, enough for two album&#x27;s worth of material. The material was separated into two batches; the material written second - during the COVID lockdown - was put together to make up the &quot;Torpedo&quot; album, while the earlier, pre-COVID material, was put together for a later 2023 release on a yet-to-be-titled twelfth album. &quot;Torpedo&quot;, has subsequently been released as of 18 March 2022. The album would later chart at No.5 on the album charts, giving the band for the first time in their career consecutive Top 5 albums, and their second No.1 in a row on the Official Record Store Chart.

===&quot;Black/Red&quot; (2023-present)===
In October 2023, the band announced a new album, and released two singles on the same day, &quot;Playing With Fire&quot; and &quot;Elf&quot;. &quot;Black/Red&quot; was released on 5 April 2024. It the band&#x27;s first double album, completing a trilogy begun with &quot;Torpedo&quot;. Nicholas explained of the album: &quot;I really wanted the album to be split in two parts for the listener, CD1 and CD2, black and red rather than be one long player, almost like a musical production with an interval.&quot;

==Sales and legacy==
Between 1997 and 2012, Feeder accumulated 25 top 75 singles when guest singles are excluded. They have headlined many of the UK&#x27;s major venues, such as Wembley Arena, Birmingham National Indoor Arena, Birmingham LG Arena, Bournemouth International Centre and the Cardiff International Arena.

Feeder&#x27;s overall album sales stand at 1,957,016 in the United Kingdom, as of 6 October 2017. Their second-highest selling release is 2002&#x27;s &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot;, shifting over 506,000 units in the UK. As of October 2017, &quot;The Singles&quot; has sold 524,000 copies. In the UK, Feeder has accumulated seven gold and platinum records. Gold records in Ireland for &quot;The Singles&quot;, &quot;Comfort in Sound&quot; and &quot;Echo Park&quot; brings their worldwide total to ten. In 2024, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; received a Platinum award for 600,000 UK consumption sales, 23 years after its release. 2001&#x27;s &quot;Just a Day&quot; was certified Gold in 2023 for 400,000 consumption sales. That same year also seen 1997&#x27;s &quot;Polythene&quot;, receive a Gold award from the BPI for sales of 100,000; almost 20 years to its release date.

Despite having dropped out of mainstream radio play since 2008, &quot;Silent Cry&quot; reached No. 8 on the UK albums chart in its first week of release, with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, the owners of the now defunct Echo Label. The &quot;Silent Cry&quot; tour was Feeder&#x27;s longest, playing 29 dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, &quot;Silent Cry&quot; remains Feeder&#x27;s first album not to achieve at least gold status.

2010&#x27;s &quot;Renegades&quot; was less successful. It entered the UK chart at No. 16 – Feeder&#x27;s first album since 1997&#x27;s &quot;Polythene&quot; not to chart within the Top 10 – and dropped out after 2 weeks. However, the charting of &quot;Renegades&quot;, marked the third decade in which a Feeder album had been released and charted at least in the Top 20. This marked their 6th studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band&#x27;s 9th album to appear on the chart regardless of position over the course of their career. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Official UK Rock Albums chart. Still, &quot;Renegades&quot; has yet to accumulate sales that approach or eclipse any of their other studio albums before this. 2012 follow-up &quot;Generation Freakshow&quot;, charted higher at No. 13 although on lower debut week sales, before 2016 saw the band return to the top 10 with &quot;All Bright Electric&quot;, then less than 12 months later appeared in the top 10 again, with &quot;The Best of Feeder&quot; in 2017. 2019&#x27;s &quot;Tallulah&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first top 5 studio album since 2005&#x27;s &quot;Pushing the Senses&quot;.

Feeder are also one of Wales&#x27; most popular rock bands. In October 2003, the bass guitar that Taka Hirose played in the video for &quot;Seven Days in the Sun&quot; was added to the Hard Rock Cafe in Cardiff.

Feeder have also gained a cult following in Japan. Their most recent seven studio albums have all charted in the top 200. Their most successful of these is 2008&#x27;s &quot;Silent Cry&quot; charting at No. 53, although their most successful and only top 40 entry to date is their 2006 singles compilation, meaning the band have charted eight albums regardless of format.

In April 2012, &quot;Total Guitar&quot; praised the band, writing that &quot;all the way from their first release, the &quot;Two Colours EP&quot; in 1995, through tragedy and triumph, he&#x27;s [Grant] gone the distance with Feeder, while other British alternative rock bands of the 90s crashed or faded&quot;.

They were inducted into &quot;Kerrang&quot;″s Hall of Fame in August 2019. Their induction came two months after Grant presented Skunk Anansie with their Hall of Fame award at the &quot;Kerrang&quot; Awards ceremony. This event marked the first time in ten years that Grant Nicholas had shared the same stage with former drummer Mark Richardson.

<text>Cape Prince of Wales (; ) is the westernmost mainland point of the Americas. It was named in 1778 by Captain James Cook of the British Royal Navy, presumably for the Prince of Wales at the time, George Augustus Frederick. Discovered (for Europeans) in 1732, by an expedition led by a Russian military geodesist Mikhail Gvozdev in &quot;Sviatoi Gavriil&quot; (&quot;St. Gabriel&quot;); later, the cape was named by Vitus Bering for Gvozdev as Mys Gvozdeva (Cape Gvozdev). The Yupik name of the cape, published by Gavril Sarychev in 1826, was &quot;Nykhta&quot;. The current name was approved by a decision of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names in 1944.

Located on the Seward Peninsula of the U.S. state of Alaska near the settlement of Wales, Cape Prince of Wales is the terminus of the Continental Divide, marking the division between the Pacific and Arctic coasts, as well as marking the limit between the Bering Sea and the Chukchi Sea. It is the eastern boundary of the Bering Strait, 51 miles (82 km) opposite Cape Dezhnev, and adjacent to the Diomede Islands and Fairway Rock.

<doc id="669092" wikidata="Q7845120" url="?curid=669092" title="Trojan genealogy of Nennius">
<text>The Trojan genealogy of Nennius was written in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; of Nennius and was created to merge Greek mythology with Christian themes. As a description of the genealogical line of Aeneas of Troy, Brutus of Britain, and Romulus and Remus, the founders of Rome, it is an example of the foundation genealogies found not only in early Irish, Welsh and Saxon texts but also in Roman sources.

As in all early Christian genealogies, it begins with God and goes through Noah before diverting to other regions. The line from God to Noah is from Genesis, chapter 5:
*God created
*Adam
*Seth
*Enos
*Cainan
*Mahalaleel
*Jared
*Enoch
*Methuselah
*Lamech
*Noah
*Japheth

As with most genealogies of Judeo-Christian origins, Nennius splits the line at this point. Hisicion, the father of Brutus of Britain, was descended from Javan on both sides. This is his paternal genealogical line:
*Javan
*Jobath
*Bath
*Hisrau
*Esraa
*Ra
*Aber
*Ooth
*Ethec
*Aurthack
*Ecthactur
*Mair
*Semion
*Boibus
*Thoi
*Ogomuin
*Fethuir, who married Rhea Silvia, the daughter of Numa Pompilius
*Alanus
*Hisicion
*Brutus

This line is the maternal line of Hisicion which includes the Trojan line:
*Javan
*Elisha
*Dardanus
*Tros, from whom Troy is named after.
*Anchises
*Aeneas
*Ascanius
*Numa Pompilius
*Rhea Silvia, Numa&#x27;s daughter and mother of Romulus and Remus.
*Alanus
*Hisicion
*Brutus

These lines conflict somewhat with the ancestry laid out by Geoffrey of Monmouth in which he states Ascanius is the grandfather of Brutus.

Although he points out that there can never be proof, John Creighton suggests that the origin of this genealogy might be an early British foundation myth, surviving from around the early first century CE into the medieval period.
Professor Tim Murray writes that this Trojan foundation myth was not challenged until Polydore Vergil, historian of the early Tudor dynasty, questioned it in the 16th century.

The relationship between Alanus, Hisicion (Hisitio) and Brutus (Britto) comes from the Frankish Table of Nations and ultimately from Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Germania&quot;. Alanus is a corruption of Tacitus&#x27; Mannus and Hisicion is an invention of the Frankish Table to provide a name for the son from which the Istvaeones descended.
