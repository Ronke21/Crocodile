<doc id="663968" wikidata="Q1500287" url="?curid=663968" title="Killing Zoe">
<text>Killing Zoe is a 1993 crime film written and directed by Roger Avary and starring Eric Stoltz, Jean-Hugues Anglade and Julie Delpy. The story details a safe cracker named Zed who returns to France to aid an old friend in performing a doomed bank heist. &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; was labeled by Roger Ebert as &quot;Generation X&#x27;s first bank caper movie.&quot; In 2019, Avary directed the semi-sequel &quot;Lucky Day&quot;.

==Plot==
Zed, a professional safe-cracker, comes to Paris to help a childhood friend, Eric, with a bank heist. While in the taxi on his way to the hotel, the cab driver offers to procure a sex worker for him in the evening. As Zed emerges from the shower, the sex worker, Zoe, arrives. After having sex, they talk amicably and express their mutual affection. Zoe confides that she is studying art and has a &quot;very boring&quot; day job. They are interrupted when Eric barges in and brusquely sends Zoe out of the room. Eric takes Zed back to his residence, where Zed meets Eric&#x27;s friends. Eric explains his plans: the following day is Bastille Day and virtually everything is closed except for a holding bank they plan to rob. Zed forgoes his rest time to spend the night partying with Eric and his friends at a seedy jazz club, which Eric refers to as &#x27;the real Paris&#x27;. As they binge, Eric confides to Zed that he has HIV, which he contracted through intravenous drug use.

The next day, Zed is awakened by Eric as they prepare to enter the bank. Donning carnival masks, Eric&#x27;s team quickly kill anybody who fails to cooperate as Zed is escorted to the bank&#x27;s safe. Their plans begin to fall apart as the police show up, with the team realizing they will either have to shoot their way out of the bank or go to jail for life. Eric blows open a vault with an explosive, finding a large supply of gold bars, but the thieves can&#x27;t leave the bank alive with their fortune. Tensions rise even higher when Zed recognizes Zoe who coincidentally works at the bank and attempts to protect her, much to Eric&#x27;s fury. A gunfight erupts between Eric&#x27;s team and the police, with Zed caught in the middle. Most of the thieves are killed, leaving Zed and Eric to fight each other. The police kill Eric. Injured, Zed is led away quickly by Zoe, who falsely states that he is a bank customer. They drive away in her car, where Zoe promises Zed that when he gets well, she&#x27;ll show him the &#x27;real&#x27; Paris.

While some have speculated the title of the film derives from the assumption that Zed contracted HIV from having Eric&#x27;s blood spill on him and he will thus pass it on to Zoe, Roger Avary has stated, &quot;Zoe means &#x27;life&#x27; in Greek, so the title of the movie can be interpreted as &#x27;Killing Life.&#x27; &quot;

==Cast==
* Eric Stoltz as Zed
* Jean-Hugues Anglade as Eric
* Julie Delpy as Zoe
* Gary Kemp as Oliver
* Kario Salem as Jean
* Tai Thai as François
* Bruce Ramsay as Ricardo
* Salvator Xuereb as Claude
* Cecilia Peck as Martina
* Ron Jeremy Hyatt as Bank Concierge
* David Richard Thompson as Burnt Vault Guard
* Djimon Hounsou as Voice of Moïse

==Production==
&quot;Killing Zoe&quot; was director Roger Avary&#x27;s feature directorial debut. When scouting filming locations for &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, the crew found a bank. Producer Lawrence Bender phoned a writer he knew, Avary, and asked if he had any screenplays that took place in a bank. Avary quickly wrote the script for &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; in a week or two. Avary stated he wanted to make &quot;an art-house film for both the coffeehouse crowd and the exploitation crowd.&quot;

Set in Paris, the film was shot almost entirely in Los Angeles, California. Only the opening and end credit roll and some small car driving clips were filmed in France. In a DVD interview, Avary explains how he wanted to make a film about how nihilistic he felt his generation was and said that watching Stoltz in the film, was like seeing his evil twin come into creation. He wrote the script specifically for Stoltz. Avary stated that, as a first time director, it was a dream to work with actors as talented as Jean-Hugues Anglade, Eric Stoltz and Julie Delpy. &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; is notable as the first feature film to use the new Otto Nemenz Swing &amp; Tilt lenses, which were used during the heroin sequences for perspective distortion instead of their original purpose of perspective correction.

==Reception==
The first market screening of &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; took place at the Raindance Film Market in October 1993. The film premiered in North America at the Sundance Film Festival in 1994. The film won the Grand Prize award at the 5th Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival held in February 1994. Jury members that year included Roger Vadim, Dario Argento, and Dennis Hopper. The film went on to win the 1994 Cannes Prix Très Spécial.

Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 36%, with an average rating of 5.30 out of 10, based on 28 reviews. The website&#x27;s &quot;Critics Consensus&quot; for the film reads, &quot;Senselessly violent and mean-spirited, &quot;Killing Zoe&quot; fails to deliver a much needed cleverness to back up its hyper-stylized flourishes.&quot;

<doc id="663971" wikidata="Q3311661" url="?curid=663971" title="Hugh Nibley">
<text>Hugh Winder Nibley (March 27, 1910 – February 24, 2005) was an American scholar and member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who was a professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) for nearly 50 years. He was a prolific author, and wrote apologetic works supporting the archaeological, linguistic, and historical claims of Joseph Smith. He was a member of the LDS Church, and wrote and lectured on LDS scripture and doctrinal topics, publishing many articles in the LDS Church magazines.

Nibley was born in Portland, Oregon, and his family moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1921, where Nibley attended middle school and high school. Nibley served an LDS mission in Germany, where he learned German. After his mission, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he graduated in 1934. He received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley) in 1938. He taught various subjects at Claremont Colleges until he enlisted in the United States Army in 1942, where he was trained as an intelligence officer as part of the Ritchie Boys.

Nibley became a professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) in 1946, where he taught foreign languages and Christian church history. He continued to study Egyptian and Coptic, and became the figurehead of the Institute for Ancient Studies at BYU in 1973. During his professorship, Nibley wrote articles for scholarly publications and for official LDS Church publications. Nibley published multiple series of articles in the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; as well as &quot;An Approach to the Book of Mormon&quot;, which was the lesson manual for Melchizedek priesthood lessons in 1957. Nibley also published a response to the Joseph Smith Papyri as well as other articles on the Pearl of Great Price. In addition to Nibley&#x27;s church publications, he also published social commentary, often aimed at LDS culture. Nibley&#x27;s work is controversial. Kent P. Jackson and Douglas F. Salmon have argued that the parallels Nibley finds between ancient culture and LDS works are selective or imprecise. Nibley&#x27;s defenders like Louis C. Midgley and Shirley S. Ricks argue that his parallels are meaningful.

Hugh Nibley&#x27;s son Alex organized a documentary on Hugh entitled &quot;Faith of an Observer&quot;. Hugh Nibley&#x27;s complete works were published jointly by the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) and Deseret Book. Around the time of Nibley&#x27;s death in 2005, his daughter Martha Beck published a memoir where she claimed to have recovered repressed memories of Nibley sexually abusing her. Immediate family members and some book reviewers of Beck&#x27;s memoirs considered her claims to be false.

==Early life and education==
Hugh Nibley was born in Portland, Oregon, son of Alexander (&quot;El&quot;) Nibley and Agnes Sloan. Among their other sons were Sloan Nibley, Richard Nibley, and Reid N. Nibley. Their father, Alexander, was the son of Charles W. Nibley, Presiding Bishop of the church. Alexander&#x27;s mother, wife of Charles, was Rebecca Neibaur. Rebecca was the daughter of Alexander Neibaur, one of the first Jewish people to convert to Mormonism. Alexander Nibley served as mission president of the Liège Conference.

In 1917, Nibley&#x27;s family moved to Medford, Oregon, where his father started to manage his father&#x27;s sugar beet company. The next year at age eight, Nibley was baptized into the LDS Church. The family returned to Portland after the sugar beet factory failed in 1919. In 1920, the principal at Nibley&#x27;s elementary school gave all of his students an IQ test. After seeing Nibley&#x27;s high scores, the principal decided to privately tutor Nibley. Nibley&#x27;s parents employed a music tutor and a French tutor for their children as well.

Nibley&#x27;s family moved to Los Angeles in 1921, where Nibley&#x27;s father participated in the burgeoning real-estate market and was part of Los Angeles&#x27;s high society. Nibley attended Alta Loma Middle School from 1921 until 1923. He graduated from Los Angeles High School in 1927, where he was friends with John Cage. Nibley was particularly interested in astronomy, art, and English. In order to see through his telescope unimpeded, he cut off his eyelashes. His interest in literature led him to study Old and Middle English, German, Latin, and Greek. He spent the summer of 1925 working in a lumber mill. In 1926, Nibley&#x27;s poems appeared in the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; and &quot;The Lyric West&quot;. That same year, his family moved to a mansion. Nibley spent six weeks alone in the wilderness near Crater Lake, excited to experience solitude and to &quot;get back to nature&quot; like the transcendentalists. Nibley took part and excelled in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). According to Nibley, he participated in ROTC at his mother&#x27;s urging, and she hoped that if there was another world war he would be an officer. The summer he was 17, he attended Brigham Young Academy&#x27;s Aspen Grove summer school.

Nibley&#x27;s parents were worried about his social development and felt that an LDS mission would help him have more contact with people. In November 1927, Nibley received his temple endowment, and studied at the Salt Lake Mission Home to serve an LDS mission in Germany until 1929. He spent his first three weeks in Germany learning German in Cologne with other missionaries. After his mission, he received special permission to visit Greece for six weeks to contact other members of the LDS Church there.

After his mission, Nibley majored in history at UCLA. He also studied Latin, Greek, and Spanish and graduated summa cum laude in 1934. Nibley&#x27;s grandfather, Charles, and his brother, Philip, died in 1931 and 1932, respectively. In June 1933, Nibley used his knowledge of shorthand and typing when he served a short-term mission in the northwestern states as the mission stenographer. He returned in time to start his PhD at UC Berkeley in September 1934. In the 1936–1937 school year, he received a fellowship that would have covered his tuition and housing. Nibley&#x27;s father asked him to loan the money to him and did not repay it. He found a job translating Latin, but because his funds were severely limited, he moved from the expensive International House to a cheap apartment, where his neighbors spoke Arabic. His dissertation, &quot;The Roman Games as a Survival of an Archaic Year Cult&quot;, was accepted, and he graduated in 1938.

==Teaching at Claremont and military service==
Nibley volunteered to teach at Claremont Colleges, and he taught without pay for the 1939–1940 school year, living frugally. The next year he worked as an instructor, and taught history, social philosophy, modern European history, humanities, U.S. history, history of education, Greek, and German. He taught alongside scholars fleeing from Germany, including Thomas Mann, and once co-taught a class with retired professor Everett Dean Martin. He acted as a secretary when prominent intellectuals spoke at the Committee on War Objectives and Peace Aims. He studied more languages, including Irish, Babylonian, Russian, Italian, and Spanish. He sought out native speakers to converse with when possible. In a letter to his friend from UC Berkeley, Paul Springer, Nibley wrote that two of his friends at Scripps College were discovered to be Nazi agents. He resigned from Claremont in June 1942, and then enlisted as a private in the United States Army for World War II.

In the army, Nibley completed weather observation school in March 1943 after he finished basic training. His commanding officer recommended him for officer training, and he attended military intelligence training in the United States Army Intelligence Center at Camp Ritchie in western Maryland. He completed intelligence training on June 2. In August he started attending the second Order of Battle course. Before leaving for Europe, he courted and proposed marriage to Anahid Iskian, but she refused. Nibley became a Master Sergeant along with his fellow Order of Battle graduates. After an OB training in Hyde Park Corner, he was assigned to help compile information on German officers for the June 1944 Order of Battle Book. He instructed officers and other men in the 101st Airborne Division about the German Order of Battle. He was part of the Utah Beach division during the D-Day invasion, and landed by glider at Eindhoven as part of Operation Market Garden. Nibley gathered intelligence on German war movements from civilians, documents, and POWs. He was the only survivor of OB team #5. He visited Dachau concentration camp a few days after its liberation. After being discharged from the army in November 1945, he went camping near Hurricane, Utah.

&quot;Improvement Era&quot; hired Nibley as a managing editor in 1946. On his own time, Nibley wrote a detailed response to Fawn M. Brodie&#x27;s significant biography of Joseph Smith, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;. The response, entitled &quot;No, Ma&#x27;am, That&#x27;s Not History&quot;, identified flaws in Brodie&#x27;s work, including the way she read the sources, but it did so using &quot;dismissive and patronizing language&quot;. According to Ronald Helfrich, author of &quot;Mormon Studies: A Critical History&quot;, &quot;No, Ma&#x27;am&quot; was &quot;a turning point in the history of Mormon apologetics and polemics&quot; because it used academic language in its arguments. Nibley&#x27;s patronizing language, Helfrich posited, could be a reflection of Nibley&#x27;s own &quot;patriarchalism and paternalism&quot;. Dale Morgan, a historian who helped Brodie while she wrote the biography, found Nibley &quot;intoxicated with his own language&quot;. Richard Bushman, famed for his own biography of Joseph Smith, after hearing the criticisms of &quot;No, Ma&#x27;am&quot;, was surprised by how &quot;on the mark&quot; it was. Nibley&#x27;s rhetorical style became popular with defenders of the church, and in 1979, Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) was founded and published &quot;Nibley-style apologetics and polemics&quot;.

While living in Salt Lake City, Nibley improved his Russian by insisting that he and his Ukrainian roommate only speak Russian. Nibley promised to pay his roommate one cent for every mistake he made in Russian and two cents for every English word he spoke.

==Professor at BYU==
Apostle John A. Widtsoe recommended Nibley to BYU President Howard S. McDonald, and he became a professor of religion and history at BYU in 1946. He taught courses in Greek and Russian alongside Christian church history his first year. He arranged for the purchase of over five hundred volumes on the early Christian church for the BYU Library; these volumes now make up the library&#x27;s Ancient Studies Reading Room. He also acquired volumes in Old Norse from the Icelandic community in Spanish Fork. He was promoted to full professor in 1953. In 1954, Nibley was on the advisory board for a student club focused on &quot;the integration of sundry areas of scientific and spiritual truth&quot; called &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;. Nibley considered leaving BYU to work at the University of Utah, but J. Reuben Clark proposed projects that Nibley could only work on at BYU. Wilkinson agreed that the university would finance two trips to university libraries per year for Nibley, so Nibley stayed at BYU. However, the university did not finance two library trips a year. Nibley published in &quot;Western Political Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Western Speech&quot;, and &quot;Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; in the 1950s.
For the 1959–1960 school year, Nibley taught at UC Berkeley as a visiting professor in humanities. He studied Egyptian with Klaus Baer, a new faculty member. Nibley was the only student in the Coptic class after several weeks, and one of two students in the Egyptian class. UC Berkeley offered to employ him as a full professor at a higher salary than what he made at BYU. Nibley decided to stay at BYU, and requested to stop teaching language classes. Nibley published a two-part article in &quot;Jewish Quarterly Review&quot; in October 1959 and January 1960 called &quot;Christian Envy of the Temple&quot;, which discussed how early Christians desired temple rites. When Nibley returned to BYU, religion faculty were debating on whether a class on the Book of Mormon or on fundamental LDS Church doctrines should be the required religion class. The debate disillusioned Nibley, and when asked to give a prayer at the June 1960 graduation exercise, he started it by saying, &quot;We have met here today clothed in the black robes of a false priesthood.&quot; He published &quot;The Passing of the Church: Forty Variations on an Unpopular Theme&quot; in &quot;Church History&quot; in 1961. In the article, Nibley argued that early Church Fathers did not expect the Christian church to succeed, and hence did not concern themselves with social issues, church administration, missionary work, or gaining support from the public; instead they hoped for death and their rewards in the afterlife. Hans J. Hillerbrand published a response in the same journal, stating that characterizing the early Christians as having an institutional &quot;church&quot; was &quot;theologically dangerous&quot;. Robert M. Grant argued that Nibley had taken statements from church fathers out of context. Grant agreed that the issue of the history of the institutional church was important, since otherwise church history might be reduced to a history of ideas. Nibley did not respond to the comments. Nibley also published articles in &quot;Revue de Qumran&quot;, &quot;Vigiliae Christianae&quot;, and &quot;Concilium: An International Review of Theology&quot; in 1965, 1966, and 1967, respectively. In his article in &quot;Vigiliae Christianae&quot;, he proposed the idea that Jesus taught his disciples additional rites after his resurrection, drawing on early Christian sources on Gnosticism. For his 1966–1967 sabbatical, he studied Egyptian at the University of Chicago with Klaus Baer and John A. Wilson. He was offered a position to teach at the Clarion State College, but refused.

In 1973, BYU president Dallin H. Oaks convinced Nibley to be the director of the Institute for Ancient Studies at BYU, with an assistant director to take care of the administrative aspects. Retiring from a staff position in 1975, he continued working as a professor emeritus until 1994. He maintained a small office in the Harold B. Lee Library, working on his magnum opus, titled &quot;One Eternal Round&quot;, focusing on the hypocephalus (&quot;Facsimile 2&quot;) in the Book of Abraham.

===Students===

Notable students of Nibley include Krešimir Ćosić, Avraham Gileadi, John Gee, and Benjamin Urrutia. After befriending Nibley&#x27;s daughter Christina, Krešimir Ćosić came to Hugh Nibley with questions about the LDS Church. Nibley taught and eventually baptized Ćosić, continuing their gospel discussions until Ćosić graduated in 1973.

===Social and political viewpoints===

Nibley was an active Democrat and a conservationist, pacifist, and anti-materialist. He was strongly opposed to the United States&#x27; involvement in the Vietnam War. &quot;Approaching Zion&quot;, volume 9 of his collected works, contains his essays on culture, where he critiqued capitalism and socialism, and endorsed the law of consecration. In a 1973 speech entitled &quot;What Is Zion? A Distant View&quot;, Nibley mentioned the sometimes dogmatic application of the BYU&#x27;s honor code, particularly the hairstyle and dress standards.
Nibley further criticized LDS culture in his 1983 speech &quot;Leaders to Managers: The Fatal Shift&quot; for encouraging students to please their superiors and &quot;not make waves&quot;, which Nibley argued was a sign of a decline in culture. In a later interview, Nibley stated that Rex E. Lee and faculty in the school of management hated the speech. Nibley felt that students were more concerned about their appearance than their studies. In his 1975 speech, &quot;Zeal Without Knowledge&quot;, he worried that students were overly focused on suffering through church meetings than being genuinely spiritually exercised.

In contrast to the coats and ties he wore at dinners as a teenager in a wealthy home, Nibley himself cultivated an appearance of not caring about his appearance. Two of his colleagues related stories of Nibley contributing to a church collection to buy a new overcoat for someone, not realizing that the person was him. One BYU professor said that Nibley was proud of his unkempt look, joking that they would never make him department chairman at BYU. His house&#x27;s lawn was often in disarray, which inspired stories about Nibley forbidding his neighbors to clean it up as a service project, or staking a goat to act as a lawn mower.

==Collaborations with the LDS Church==
In 1957, Nibley&#x27;s book &quot;An Approach to the Book of Mormon&quot; was the LDS Church&#x27;s official lesson manual for Melchizedek priesthood lessons. The book drew parallels between events in the Book of Mormon and ancient Near Eastern traditions. In an essay on Mormon historiography, Marvin S. Hill argued that many of the parallels between ancient culture and the Book of Mormon &quot;seem as much American as they do ancient&quot; though Hill does not go into further detail. That year, Nibley received many letters with questions about religion from members who read his book. He compiled reports on various topics to answer frequently asked questions from readers and to inform general authorities. After the manual was published, he frequently gave speeches to local church congregations. In reviewing the third edition, published in 1988, William J. Hamblin stated that while Nibley&#x27;s explanation of ancient Near Eastern culture was accurate, he drew anachronistic parallels that weakened his other, stronger arguments. Hamblin also stated that Nibley ignored significant differences between Near Eastern cultures and occurrences in the Book of Mormon.

Nibley published several series in the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; about the Book of Mormon for a general LDS audience. In 1954, Nibley discussed the circumstances around the early Christian apostasy in a series of thirty talks on a weekly devotional on KSL in 1954. He wrote a series for the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; on the same topic in 1955, and other series on the Jaredites and Book of Mormon criticism in the late 1950s. Nibley continued to write about evidences of the Book of Mormon&#x27;s ancient origins in a series of articles published in the &quot;Improvement Era&quot; between 1964 and 1967. This series was collected in &quot;Since Cumorah: The Book of Mormon in the Modern World&quot; (1967). The book received some critical attention. In &quot;BYU Studies&quot;, Alexander T. Stecker found &quot;Since Cumorah&quot; a &quot;stimulating&quot; introduction to &quot;many problems&quot;, but one that overburdened its readers with &quot;irrelevant facts&quot; and lacked a bibliography. In &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Louis C. Midgley praised Nibley&#x27;s application of Book of Mormon concepts to current politics. Robert Mesle, a member of the Community of Christ, wrote in a review of the book that Nibley&#x27;s lack of criticism towards the LDS Church prevented Nibley from being sufficiently critical, describing Nibley&#x27;s work as &quot;trite and naïve&quot;.

In 1961, Nibley published &quot;The Myth Makers&quot; through Bookcraft. In the book, Nibley countered anti-Mormon assertions about Joseph Smith in the style of a classical apologist. Once again, general authorities were impressed with Nibley&#x27;s writings, and when Irving Wallace&#x27;s &quot;The Twenty-Seventh Wife&quot; was published, they asked Nibley to write a response. Nibley enthusiastically studied historical material about Brigham Young. He published &quot;Sounding Brass: Informal Studies in the Lucrative Art of Telling Stories about Brigham Young and the Mormons&quot;, which addressed not only the claims in Wallace&#x27;s book but many other claims about Brigham Young. The book includes the satirical chapter &quot;How to Write an Anti-Mormon Book (A Handbook for Beginners)&quot;. In an essay in &quot;Historians and the Far West&quot;, Thomas G. Alexander stated that &quot;Sounding Brass&quot; sarcastically points out obvious flaws in a form of &quot;intellectual overkill&quot;. Alexander stated that orthodox Mormons would appreciate that the book bolsters their point of view, but that historians would prefer a more detailed treatment of events.

In 1967, the LDS Church acquired the Joseph Smith Papyri. The First Presidency asked Nibley to respond to the papyri. In 1975, Nibley published a translation and commentary of the papyri. In it, Nibley argued that the text of the papyri from the Book of Breathings was connected to the LDS temple ceremony, the Endowment. Nibley continued to write about Abraham, publishing &quot;Abraham in Egypt&quot; in 1981. He focused on showing that Joseph Smith&#x27;s writings in the Pearl of Great Price were inspired and derived from ancient texts. Marvin S. Hill criticized Nibley for comparing the Book of Abraham to records from hundreds of years after Abraham; Louis Midgley criticized Hill for misunderstanding Nibley&#x27;s argument, which was to compare the Book of Abraham against existent parallel literature that was unknown to Joseph Smith. In a 1982 review published in &quot;&quot;, Eric Jay Olsen stated that Nibley&#x27;s eclectic approach in &quot;Abraham in Egypt&quot; was overwhelming in its citations of obscure sources. Olsen criticized Nibley&#x27;s selection of examples that supported his arguments.

In 1985, church leaders were contemplating changes to the temple endowment and asked Nibley to write on the &quot;history and significance of the endowment&quot; for them. In 1986, Nibley presented one essay on the temple to the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with another, longer essay on the history of the endowment given for support material. The essays were reprinted in other books, but without specific references to the temple endowment ceremony.

==Scholarship and criticism==
Evangelical scholars Mosser and Owen called Nibley the &quot;Father of Mormon Scholarly Apologetics&quot;. William J. Hamblin, a colleague at BYU, said, &quot;Nibley&#x27;s methodology consists more of comparative literature than history.&quot; Writing for &quot;Journal of Book of Mormon Studies&quot;, Joseph Spencer, a BYU professor of religion, wrote that Nibley was &quot;&quot;the&quot; mobilizing force of what now seems to be a field [of Book of Mormon studies]&quot;. Nibley himself, in a 1951 letter to Francis Kirkham, wrote that he was not &quot;a Book of Mormon scholar&quot; and defined his studies as &quot;popular works&quot; that &quot;should not come within the scope of a university press&quot;. In his defense of the Book of Mormon in &quot;Lehi in the Desert and the World of the Jaredites&quot;, Nibley positioned himself as composing a defensive case in an intellectual battle against anti-Mormon arguments, acknowledging that as a &quot;counsel for the defense&quot;, he was &quot;partial&quot; though he maintained that his citations and evidence were &quot;competent and unprejudiced&quot;. Concerned that his historical arguments in &quot;Since Cumorah&quot; were overshadowing the main message of the Book of Mormon, Nibley shifted his writing on the Book of Mormon to focus on sermons about the book&#x27;s prophetic message. Nibley still wrote about the historicity of the Book of Abraham after 1967.

In his 1988 review of &quot;The Complete Works of Hugh Nibley Vol. 1&quot; in BYU Studies, Kent P. Jackson criticized Nibley for lacking sources, using sources selectively, and using sources out of context. Jackson argued that Nibley&#x27;s early research was his weakest, and that some should not have been published in his collected works. In response, Louis Midgley defended Nibley&#x27;s methodology, and wrote that Jackson denied the possibility of comparative studies, since all historical scholarship &quot;involves selection among alternatives&quot;.

Eugene England&#x27;s review of &quot;Since Cumorah&quot; and &quot;Approaching Zion&quot;, volumes 7 and 9 of Nibley&#x27;s collected works, identified Nibley as a Cassandra figure. England noted that Nibley&#x27;s social commentary on preserving the environment, avoiding war, and opposing prosperity theology often went ignored. England praised Nibley&#x27;s clear prose and witty satire, identifying the absence of the speech &quot;Leaders to Managers: The Fatal Shift&quot; as a major flaw in the volumes.

In a 2000 issue of &quot;Dialogue&quot;, Douglas F. Salmon examined Nibley&#x27;s comparative method, focusing on his series of articles on Enoch written for the &quot;Ensign&quot; titled &quot;A Strange Thing in the Land: The Return of the Book of Enoch&quot;. Salmon noted that some of the parallels Nibley found between the Pearl of Great Price and ancient texts were extremely selective, and others were imprecise, inconsequential, or misrepresented sources: &quot;parallelomania&quot;. Salmon concluded that appropriate parallels must discuss the ancient work&#x27;s language, culture, and context. In response, Hamblin stated in &quot;The FARMS Review of Books&quot; that even though Nibley had made a few errors, that was not cause to dismiss his entire argument about the Pearl of Great Price&#x27;s parallels with ancient texts about Enoch. Hamblin accused Salmon of ignoring what FARMS researchers have said about the methodology of parallels, and of erroneously finding errors in Nibley&#x27;s research.

In Jerald and Sandra Tanner&#x27;s &quot;Salt Lake City Messenger&quot;, Ronald V. Huggins wrote in 2008 that Nibley &quot;modifies his quotations to artificially render them more supportive&quot;, and provided several examples. Shirley S. Ricks wrote a response in the &quot;FARMS Review of Books&quot;. Drawing on the experience of the people who checked Nibley&#x27;s footnotes, she explained that editors or typists could introduce errors. She stated that some of Nibley&#x27;s published work was not intended for publication, like his speeches, and that fact-checkers had to supply footnotes on their own. Ricks, along with apologists associated with FAIR (formerly FairMormon), assert that while Nibley&#x27;s arguments could be overly-aggressive, and his footnotes could have errors for many reasons, Nibley did not fabricate his sources. Addressing Huggins&#x27;s criticisms directly, Ricks argued that Nibley&#x27;s translation style could be more poetic than literal, and that Nibley saw translation as a commentary in itself.

Nibley&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;One Eternal Round&quot;, was published as volume 19 of his collected works in 2012, with additional writing by Michael D. Rhodes. Gary P. Gillum, the ancient studies librarian during the time Nibley worked at BYU, reviewed the book in &quot;BYU Studies&quot;. Gillum summarized the book as a &quot;comprehensive look at Facsimile No. 2&quot;. Nibley and Rhodes argue that parallels between Egyptian religion and &quot;Joseph Smith&#x27;s explanation of Facsimile No. 2&quot; are not convenient selections but major theological themes in both Egyptian and LDS religion, thus providing support for the authenticity of Joseph Smith&#x27;s revelations.

Egyptologist John Gee, a student of Nibley and contemporary Mormon apologist, wrote, &quot;Nibley has a tendency to use myth for history and to flatten the chronology of sources from a variety of periods to create his historical portrait.&quot; Ariel Bybee Laughton, a scholar of early Christianity, wrote that Nibley&#x27;s writing on early Christianity &quot;displays the seams and cracks of a methodology largely founded upon apologetic motivation.&quot;

==Legacy==

From 1982 to 1984, Hugh&#x27;s son Alex Nibley organized the filming of interviews with Nibley to use in a documentary about his life called &quot;Faith of an Observer&quot;. Sterling Van Wagenen was a producer. It premiered at Hugh&#x27;s special 75th birthday celebration at BYU. After John Welch organized FARMS, he and Deseret Book agreed to co-publish a collected works of Hugh Nibley. The first volume was published in 1986 and 14 volumes were printed by 2002. FARMS also published a two-volume Festschrift in honor of Nibley&#x27;s 80th birthday. The collection included essays by Aziz Atiya, James Charlesworth, Cyrus Gordon, Jacob Milgrom, Jacob Neusner, and Raphael Patai. When the Ancient Studies Reading Room in the Harold B. Lee Library was relocated in 2001, it was renamed the Hugh Nibley Ancient Studies Reading Room. Alex Nibley later compiled Hugh&#x27;s World War II memories in &quot;Sargeant Nibley, PhD&quot;, which was published in 2006. He gave the materials for his final book to FARMS in the fall of 2002, which was published in March 2010 as commemoration for what would have been his 100th birthday. His obituary reported that he was fluent in 14 languages. In 2021, the Interpreter Foundation and Eborn books published &quot;Hugh Nibley Observed&quot;, which collected the speeches given at the 2010 commemoration of Nibley&#x27;s centennial as well as tributes and Nibley folklore.

Nibley was a Mormon folk legend during his lifetime, and frequently members of the LDS Church told fantastic stories about him. A &quot;Sunstone&quot; magazine article documenting several common folk stories (some of questionable veracity) reported that Latter-day Saints would talk of Nibley, for example, shouting quotes from the &quot;Illiad&quot; while a parachutist in World War II in an attempt to convince Greeks he was friendly, or absent-mindedly recommending German readings to a student without considering the student&#x27;s inability to read the language. In her thesis on Nibley folklore, Jane Brady found that Nibley stories could be organized into five categories based on the role Nibley played in them: hero, iconoclast, eccentric, spiritual guide, and defender of the faith. Brady put Nibley stories into the context of folklore stories, stating that they illustrated ways that the people who told the stories within BYU&#x27;s community felt about their own roles as LDS scholars.

Nibley&#x27;s 1963 speech &quot;Three Shrines: Mantic, Sophic, and Sophistic&quot; distinguished between the sophic and mantic, or a classical tradition of distinguishing between the natural and supernatural. H. Curtis Wright, a professor in BYU&#x27;s library science program, described Nibley&#x27;s work with sophic and mantic as &quot;the most insightful thing [Nibley] has ever done&quot; describing the idea as &quot;far more basic than the epistemological disjunction of reason and the senses&quot;.

==Personal life==
Nibley&#x27;s parents separated after they lost most of their money and had to sell their mansion in 1941. His mother, Agnes Sloan, or &quot;Sloanie&quot;, didn&#x27;t require him to do chores when he was growing up. Alex Nibley, Hugh&#x27;s son, described her as sometimes &quot;getting involved to an uncomfortable degree&quot;. In her old age, she was unable to live on her own, but suffered from arthritis and paranoia. Hugh&#x27;s father, later in his life, encouraged families to get involved in &quot;high-risk schemes&quot;, and used his relationship to Hugh to gain families&#x27; trust.

Nibley met Phyllis Draper (born August 2, 1926) at BYU prior to teaching his first classes there. They married in September 1946 and had eight children. In a collection of folklore about Nibley, Dan McKinley reported that Nibley wrote that Phyllis &quot;knew when to leave [him] alone&quot; in an exhibit of BYU professors&#x27; tributes to their wives. Phyllis said that while Nibley enjoyed spending time with his children when they were young, he became distant as they got older. Nibley died on February 24, 2005, in his home in Provo, Utah, at the age of 94. Phyllis Draper Nibley died February 25, 2022, at the age of 95.

===Martha Beck&#x27;s claims===
Nibley&#x27;s daughter Martha Beck published &quot;Leaving the Saints: How I Lost the Mormons and Found My Faith&quot; in 2005, describing her departure from the LDS Church, and claiming in 1990 she had recovered repressed memories of childhood sexual abuse by her father. Beck linked the abuse to her father&#x27;s role as an apologist for the Mormon faith. The book was condemned by the LDS Church. The allegations received national publicity. Nibley had long been aware of the allegations, and denied them. Beck&#x27;s seven siblings responded, noting about half the Nibley siblings had left the LDS church or were not active in Mormonism and most had taken issue with elements of their father&#x27;s personality or habits but were unified in their rejection of Beck&#x27;s claims. In a review of &quot;Leaving the Saints&quot; for &quot;Sunstone&quot; magazine, Tania Rands Lyon noted many &quot;internal inconsistencies&quot; in Beck&#x27;s narrative that argued against the abuse claims and was put off by the relentlessly negative view of Mormonism. Lyon also noted how Beck originally intended for the manuscript to be a novel but changed it to be an autobiography at her publisher&#x27;s suggestion.

<text>Percy Marshall Young (17 May 19129 May 2004) was a British music scholar, editor, organist, composer, conductor and teacher.

==Life and career==
Young was born in Northwich, Cheshire. His father, twice mayor of Northwich, was a clerk at Brunner Mond Chemical works in Winsford; his mother, Annie née Marshall, was a nurse. Young was educated at the local Sir John Deane&#x27;s Grammar School, from where he won a scholarship to Christ&#x27;s Hospital, Horsham, where, taught by Robert Wilkinson, he became senior Music Grecian; and then, in 1930, he won an organ scholarship to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he read English (studying under Tom Henn), History and Music (studying music history under Edward Dent and organ under Cyril Rootham). Staying a fourth year in Cambridge, taking up the Stuart of Rannoch Scholarship, he was awarded the William Barclay Squire Prize for music paleography. Then from 1934 to 1937 he was Director of Music at Stranmillis Teacher Training College in Belfast, during which years he earned a Mus.D. at Trinity College, Dublin. From 1937 to 1944 Young was Musical Adviser to Stoke-on-Trent Local Education Authority. After that, Young became Director of Music at Wolverhampton College of Technology, a position he would occupy from 1944 to 1966, after which he became an independent scholar, prolific author, music-arranger / -editor and enthusiastic lecturer, broadcaster, adjudicator and examiner. In 1985 he was made a D.Mus., h.c., by The University of Birmingham; and in 1998 he was made an Honorary Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge.

Young published more than fifty books. Among those are biographies of musicians Handel (1947), Elgar (five books: 1955–1978), Vaughan Williams (1953), Schumann (1957), Kodály (1964), Sir Arthur Sullivan (1971), Alice, Lady, Elgar (1978), and Sir George Grove (1980). Also, for younger readers, he wrote a series of ten titles on composers Handel, Haydn, Mozart, Schubert, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák, Debussy, Stravinsky, and Britten.

From fragments left by Elgar Young reconstructed, and published, a suite from unfinished opera &quot;The Spanish Lady&quot;. 

Young edited Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s opera &quot;H.M.S.Pinafore&quot; (2000) for the complete edition of The Savoy Operas (Broude Brothers, New York) and was General Editor of the complete edition. 

His own compositions include: &quot;Virgin&#x27;s Slumber Song&quot; (1932), &quot;From a Child&#x27;s Garden&quot; (Robert Louis Stevenson; 1941), Passacaglia for violin and piano (1931), Fugal Concerto in G minor for 2 pianos and strings (1951), &quot;Elegy for String Orchestra&quot; (1960) and &quot;Festival Te Deum&quot; (1961). There are also many unpublished pieces for brass ensemble. Piano duo Keith Swallow and John Wilson have recorded his &quot;Five Folk Song Duets&quot; (1938).

Young was also an keen followers and historian of Association football, writing twelve books on the genre including histories of several League clubs -- Wolverhampton Wanderers, Manchester United, Bolton Wanderers, &quot;Football on Merseyside&quot;, &quot;Football in Sheffield&quot; -- plus a history of the game itself (&quot;A History of British Football&quot;). 
Young was also a Labour councillor in Wolverhampton, gaining the Wednesfield Heath ward from the Conservatives. In the 1970s he was Chairman of The Council for Community Relations in Wolverhampton. 

After the death of his first wife, Netta Carson, Young married Renée Morris in 1969, who survives him, along with three sons and a daughter of his first marriage.

Young&#x27;s archive is held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham.

<text>Proteus is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. It is a rod shaped, aerobic and motile bacteria, which is able to migrate across surfaces due its “swarming” characteristic in temperatures between 20 and 37 °C. Their size generally ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 μm in diameter and 1.0–3.0 μm in length. They tend to have an ammonia smell. &quot;Proteus&quot; bacilli are widely distributed in nature as saprophytes, being found in decomposing animal matter, sewage, manure soil, the mammalian intestine, and human and animal feces. They are opportunistic pathogens, commonly responsible for urinary and septic infections, often nosocomial.

The term Proteus signifies changeability of form, as personified in the Homeric poems in Proteus, &quot;the old man of the sea&quot;, who tends the sealflocks of Poseidon and has the gift of endless transformation. The first use of the term “Proteus” in bacteriological nomenclature was made by Hauser (1885), who described under this term three types of organisms which he isolated from putrefied meat.

==Clinical significance==
Three species—&quot;P. vulgaris&quot;, &quot;P. mirabilis&quot;, and &quot;P. penneri&quot;—are opportunistic human pathogens. &quot;Proteus&quot; includes pathogens responsible for many human urinary tract infections. &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; causes wound and urinary tract infections. Most strains of &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; are sensitive to ampicillin and cephalosporins. &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; is not sensitive to these antibiotics but ticarcillin. However, this organism is isolated less often in the laboratory and usually only targets immunosuppressed individuals. &quot;P. vulgaris&quot; occurs naturally in the intestines of humans and a wide variety of animals, and in manure, soil, and polluted waters. &quot;P. mirabilis&quot;, once attached to the urinary tract, infects the kidney more commonly than &quot;E. coli&quot;. &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; is often found as a free-living organism in soil and water.

About 10–15% of kidney stones are struvite stones, caused by alkalinization of the urine by the action of the urease enzyme (which splits urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide) of &quot;Proteus&quot; (and other) bacterial species.

==Identification==

&quot;Proteus&quot; species do not usually ferment lactose. Similar to other members of the Enterobacterales order, bacteria from the &quot;Proteus&quot; genus are glucose fermenting, oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, and nitrate-positive. Glucose fermentation in this species can be demonstrated through the triple sugar iron (TSI) test. Specific tests include positive urease (which is the fundamental test to differentiate &quot;Proteus&quot; from &quot;Salmonella&quot;) and phenylalanine deaminase tests.

On the species level, indole was considered reliable, as it is positive for &quot;P. vulgaris&quot;, but negative for &quot;P. mirabilis&quot;. However, further biochemical testing is now required to speciate &quot;Proteus&quot; since the discovery of the indole positive &quot;Proteus hauseri&quot; Most strains produce a powerful urease enzyme, which rapidly hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon monoxide; exceptions are some Providencia strains. Species can be motile, and have characteristic &quot;swarming&quot; patterns. Underlying these behaviors are the somatic O and flagellar H antigens, so named based on Kauffman–White classification. This system is based on historic observations of Edmund Weil (1879–1922) and Arthur Felix (1887–1956) of a thin surface film produced by agar-grown flagellated &quot;Proteus&quot; strains, a film that resembled the mist produced by breath on a glass. Flagellated (swarming, motile) variants were therefore designated H forms (German &quot;Hauch&quot;, for film, literally breath or mist); nonflagellated (nonswarming, nonmotile) variants growing as isolated colonies and lacking the surface film were designated as O forms (German &quot;ohne Hauch&quot;, without film [i.e., without surface film of mist droplets]).

The cell wall O-antigen of certain strains of&quot; Proteus&quot;, such as OX-2, OX-19, OX-k, crossreact with several species of &quot;Rickettsia&quot;. These antigens can be used in laboratory to detect the presence of antibodies against certain &quot;Rickettsia&quot; species in patients&#x27; sera. This test is called Weil-Felix reaction after its originators.

== Food industry ==
Cheese makers have found &quot;Proteus&quot; bacterium&#x27;s species &quot;Proteus vulgaris&quot;, growing on cheese rinds in purple color, making the cheese inedible. It is successful in implanting itself in a complex cheese ecosystem and substantially contributed to the organoleptic properties of cheese during ripening. It does not interact well with other bacteria in the same ecosystem.

The 11-story (185 feet or 56.9 meters high) glass and steel building in the downtown core of Seattle, Washington was opened to the public on May 23, 2004. Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus of OMA/LMN were the principal architects, and Magnusson Klemencic Associates was the structural engineer with Arup. Arup also provided mechanical, electrical, and plumbing engineering, as well as fire/life safety, security, IT and communications, and audio visual consulting. Hoffman Construction Company of Portland, Oregon, was the general contractor.

The public library has the capacity to hold about one and a half million books and other materials. It offers underground public parking for 143 vehicles and over 400 computers accessible to the public. Over two million people visited the library during its first year. It is the third Seattle Central Library building to be located on the same site at 1000 Fourth Avenue, the block bounded by Fourth and Fifth Avenues and Madison and Spring Streets. The library has a unique, striking appearance, consisting of several discrete &quot;floating platforms&quot; seemingly wrapped in a large steel net around glass skin. Architectural tours of the building began in June 2004.

In 2007, the building was voted #108 on the American Institute of Architects&#x27; list of Americans&#x27; 150 favorite structures in the U.S. It was one of two places in Seattle to be included on the list of 150 structures, the other being T-Mobile Park.

==History==
There has been a library located in downtown Seattle as far back as 1891; however, the library did not have its own dedicated facilities and it was frequently on the move from building to building. The Seattle Carnegie Library, the first permanent library located in its own dedicated building at Fourth Avenue and Madison Street, opened on December 19, 1906, with a Beaux-Arts design by Peter J. Weber. Andrew Carnegie, whose patronage of libraries later included five others in Seattle, donated $200,000 for the construction of the new library. That library, at , with an extension built in 1946, eventually became too small and cramped for the city&#x27;s growing population by the 1950s; it had also sustained structural damage from the 1949 Olympia earthquake. A temporary library was set up in the Electric Building on the corner of Seventh Avenue and Olive Way; originally built in 1909, the building was owned by Puget Sound Power and Light until December 1956, when the company sold the building to Frederick &amp; Nelson and moved its offices to the Puget Power Building in Bellevue. The Carnegie library closed on March 22, 1957, with demolition commencing that July.

A second library, at five stories and , was built at the site of the old Carnegie library and opened on March 26, 1960. The new building designed by architects Bindon and Wright, with Decker, Christenson, and Kitchin as associates, featured an international-style architecture and an expanded interior, with features such as drive-thru service to offset the lack of available parking. George Tsutakawa&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Wisdom&quot; on the Fifth Avenue side (relocated to Fourth Avenue in the current library) was the first of that artist&#x27;s many sculptural fountains. A remodeling finished in 1972 gave the public access to the fourth story, dedicated to the arts and sound recordings. By the late 1990s, the library became too cramped again and two-thirds of its materials were held in storage areas inaccessible to patrons. Renewed consciousness of regional earthquake dangers drew concern from public officials about the seismic risks inherent to the building&#x27;s design.

To make way for the current Seattle Central Library, which is the third library building to inhabit the city block between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, the second library was closed on June 8, 2001, and demolished that November; a temporary library had opened on July 7 in rented spaced at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. Funding for the new Seattle Central Library building, as well as other construction projects throughout the library system, was provided by a $196.4 million bond measure, called &quot;Libraries for All,&quot; approved by Seattle voters on November 3, 1998. The project also received a $20 million donation from Bill Gates, of Microsoft.

== Design ==
Rem Koolhaas and Joshua Prince-Ramus of the Dutch firm Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), working in conjunction with the Seattle firm LMN Architects, served as the building&#x27;s principal architects. Ramus served as the partner in charge. Bjarke Ingels designed the interior boxes for OMA. OMA was not one of the firms invited to compete for the project. Ramus, formerly a Seattle resident, found out from his mother one day in advance that the library board was inviting interested firms to attend a mandatory public meeting. He flew in, and OMA ended up winning the project.

Deborah Jacobs, Chief Librarian in the Seattle Public Library system, spearheaded the project from the library&#x27;s perspective and served as the primary client voice, while Betty Jane Narver served as president of the Library Board.

The architects conceived the new Central Library building as a celebration of books, deciding after some research that despite the arrival of the 21st century and the &quot;digital age,&quot; people still respond to books printed on paper. The 11-story Central Library has a capacity for over 1.5 million books, in comparison to only 900,000 in the old library building. The architects also worked to make the library inviting to the public, rather than stuffy, which they discovered was the popular perception of libraries as a whole.

Although the library is an unusual shape from the outside, the architects&#x27; philosophy was to let the building&#x27;s required functions dictate what it should look like, rather than imposing a structure and making the functions conform to that.

===Layout===

The first level, facing 4th Avenue, has a lobby, holds pick-up, and a children&#x27;s center. It also includes the Microsoft Auditorium, which seats 275 people for events. An escalator connects the 4th Avenue lobby to the third level, which faces 5th Avenue and is named the Norcliffe Foundation Living Room. It includes a small cafe, a gift shop, and a teen center. The fourth level, named the &quot;Red Floor&quot;, uses 13 shades of red paint on surfaces and includes four meeting rooms and two computer labs. The main computer lab is located on the fifth level, named the Charles Simonyi Mixing Chamber, with 338 computer stations and a reference desk.

A major section of the building is the &quot;Books Spiral&quot;, which is designed to display the library&#x27;s nonfiction collection without breaking up the Dewey Decimal System classification onto different floors or sections. The collection occupies the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth stories on a continuous series of shelves with a maximum slope of 2 degrees. The eighth level also includes music practice rooms, while the ninth level has a genealogy collection and map room. The tenth level is divided between the Seattle Room, which contains local history collections, and the Betty Jane Narver Reading Room with 400 seats. It also includes the highest viewpoints in the building.

New functions include automatic book sorting and conveyance, self-checkout for patrons, pervasive wireless communications among the library staff, and over 400 public computer terminals.

Below the library is a 143-stall parking garage that is open for use by library patrons and other members of the public for a fee.

== Response ==

Use of the building is more than double the predicted volume. In the library&#x27;s first year, 2.3 million people came to visit the library; roughly 30% were from outside Seattle. The library generated $16 million in new economic activity for its surrounding area in its first year.
The opinion of architectural critics and the general public has been mixed. Paul Goldberger, writing in &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; declared the Seattle Central Library &quot;the most important new library to be built in a generation, and the most exhilarating.&quot; The American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) of Washington awarded the Library its Platinum Award for innovation and engineering in its &quot;structural solutions&quot;. The library also received a 2005 national AIA Honor Award for Architecture.

Lawrence Cheek, the architecture critic for the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, revisited the building in 2007 and found it &quot;confusing, impersonal, uncomfortable, oppressive&quot; on the whole, with various features &quot;decidedly unpleasant,&quot; &quot;relentlessly monotonous,&quot; &quot;badly designed and cheesily detailed,&quot; &quot;profoundly dreary and depressing,&quot; and &quot;cheaply finished or dysfunctional,&quot; concluding that his earlier praise for the building was a &quot;mistake.&quot;

The library was roundly condemned by the Project for Public Spaces, which noted &quot;if the library were a true &#x27;community hub,&#x27; its most active areas would connect directly to the street, spinning off activity in every direction. That is where Koolhaas&#x27;s library, sealed away from the sidewalks and streets around it, fails completely.&quot; It went on to note &quot;critics have cast it as a masterpiece of public space design. As if blinded by the architect&#x27;s knack for flash and publicity, they cannot locate, or perhaps refuse to acknowledge, the faults in his creation.&quot;

The confusing layout of the library&#x27;s structure was also addressed in a book by architect Ruth Conroy Dalton and cognitive scientist Christoph Hölscher, called &quot;Take One Building: Interdisciplinary Research Perspectives of the Seattle Central Library&quot;. Researchers examined it as a model case for investigating the interplay between the building&#x27;s complexity and individual differences in wayfinding ability.

<text>The New York Yanks were an American football team that played in the National Football League under that name in the 1950 and 1951 seasons.

==Season-by-season overview==
===1949===

The team began in 1944 as the Boston Yanks, owned by Kate Smith&#x27;s manager, Ted Collins. He wanted a team in New York City, but had to be content with one in Boston after the New York Giants refused to let his new team share the New York area.

In 1949, Collins suspected that the All-America Football Conference was on its last legs and received permission to move the Yanks to New York. Rather than a formal relocation, however, Collins asked the NFL to fold his Boston franchise and grant him a new one for New York, most likely as a tax write-off. This new team played as the New York Bulldogs and shared the Polo Grounds with the Giants during the 1949 season.

The 1949 Bulldogs were a disaster on the field (1–10–1) as well as the box office, drawing just 48,007 fans to their six home games, with by far the largest crowd (17,704) coming against the Giants.

The nadir came during a 13–13 tie with the Washington Redskins on October 30, which drew a meager 3,678 fans, the lowest attendance at a non-neutral site NFL game since 1939 (excluding 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic severely limited attendance).

===1950===
In 1950, Collins changed his franchise&#x27;s name to the New York Yanks and moved to Yankee Stadium, essentially merging the woeful Bulldogs with the New York Yankees of the now-defunct AAFC, as part of a deal in which he bought the rights to most of the Yankees players. (Eighteen players from the &#x27;49 Yankees played for the Yanks in 1950, while only four players from the 1949 Bulldogs — Joe Domnanovich, Joe Golding, John Nolan and John Rauch — returned.)

After splitting their first two games, the Yanks went on a five-game winning streak, putting them on top of the NFL&#x27;s new National Conference with a 6–1 record. Led by quarterback George Ratterman (whom the Yanks acquired after his old team, the Buffalo Bills, failed to be accepted in the NFL-AAFC merger), New York rolled up 190 points in those five victories. (Attendance improved as well; after attracting barely 30,000 total to their first three home games (all Yanks victories), 48,642 showed up for their next home game against Chicago, followed by 42,673 against the Rams.) That proved to be the team&#x27;s high-water mark, however; a porous defense led to a four-game losing streak that knocked the Yanks out of the race. A win over the expiring Baltimore franchise (playing its last game) upped their final record to 7–5, good enough for third place and a definite improvement over 1949.

===1951===

The football Yanks had two future Hall of Fame linemen in Art Donovan and Mike McCormack in 1951.

Their biggest opponent turned out to be their landlords, the baseball Yankees, who won the American League pennant, and did not want the field torn up during the 1951 World Series.

The Yanks were forced to move their first two home games to Los Angeles and Detroit, both of which were blowout losses. Their next five games resulted in four losses by a total of 16 points and one tie, all but one of which were also played on the road (only four of their 12 games for the season were at home).

With a 0–6–1 record, the Yanks season was already over, and their attendance crashed in response: their sole home game in that span, a 29–27 loss to the Green Bay Packers, drew just 7,351 fans.

The Yanks finished the 1951 season with only one victory, a 31–28 win in their road game against Green Bay. Their final game, at Yankee Stadium against the Giants, was played on an icy field with a game time temperature of , and drew only 6,658 fans to Yankee Stadium.

The Yanks lost 27–17 to finish their season at 1–9–2 and last place in the league.

===Season-by-season record===
Yanks Total: 8 - 14 - 2

==Decline and dissolution==
After only 37,268 people attended their four home games in 1951 (three losses and a tie), the New York Yanks were reported to have been sold back to the league following the season, but it is more likely the franchise was simply cancelled by the NFL.

Shortly thereafter, a group of Dallas businessmen bought the Yanks&#x27; roster and player contracts, though it was ostensibly a new franchise, and moved them to Dallas as the Dallas Texans, playing at the Cotton Bowl. That franchise, in turn, failed after only one season, and the remains were awarded to a Baltimore-based group that used it to start the new Baltimore Colts.

However, the NFL and the current Colts organization (which relocated to Indianapolis in 1984) do not consider the Colts to be a continuation of the New York Yanks or any other franchise.

<text>Colm Joseph Feore (; born August 22, 1958) is a Canadian actor. A 15-year veteran of the Stratford Festival, he is known for his Gemini-winning turn as Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the CBC miniseries &quot;Trudeau&quot; (2002), his portrayal of Glenn Gould in &quot;Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot; (1993), and for playing Detective Martin Ward in &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot; (2006) and its sequel &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop 2&quot; (2017).

His other roles include Martin Harrison in &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), Lord Marshal Zhylaw in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004)&quot;,&quot; First Gentleman Henry Taylor on &quot;24&quot; (2009), Cardinal Della Rovere on &quot;The Borgias&quot; (2011–2013)&quot;,&quot; Laufey in &quot;Thor&quot; (2011), General Ted Brockhart on &quot;House of Cards&quot; (2016–2017), Declan Gallard on &quot;21 Thunder&quot; (2017), Wernher von Braun in &quot;For All Mankind&quot; (2019), and Sir Reginald Hargreeves on &quot;The Umbrella Academy&quot; (2019–2024). Feore is also a Prix Iris and Screen Actors Guild Award winner and a Genie Award nominee.

==Early life and education==
Feore was born on August 22, 1958, in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Irish immigrants, and the family moved back to Ireland shortly after Colm was born, remaining there for several years before emigrating to Windsor, Ontario. After graduating from Ridley College in St. Catharines, Ontario, he attended the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal, Quebec.

==Career==
Feore honed his acting skills as a member of the Acting Company of the Stratford Festival of Canada, North America&#x27;s largest classical repertory theatre. He spent 17 seasons at Stratford where he rose from bit parts to leading roles, including Romeo, Hamlet, Richard III, and Cyrano. He returned in 2006 to star in four productions, including &quot;Don Juan&quot; in both English and French and as Fagin in &quot;Oliver!&quot; In 2009 he played the main role of Macbeth in the play &quot;Macbeth&quot;, the main role of Cyrano in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, and Lear in &quot;King Lear&quot; in 2014, all performed at the Stratford Festival Theatre. He also has appeared on Broadway as Cassius in the production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; starring Denzel Washington as Brutus. Off-Broadway, for the Public Theater, he was Claudius in a &quot;Hamlet&quot; production that starred Liev Schreiber.

In Canada, Feore&#x27;s most famous roles were as Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in the critically acclaimed television mini-series &quot;Trudeau&quot;, a role for which he won a Gemini Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Dramatic Program or Mini-Series, as classical pianist Glenn Gould in the 1993 film &quot;Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould&quot;, and as by-the-book English Canadian detective Martin Ward in the box-office hit &quot;Bon Cop, Bad Cop&quot;. He also played a crazed marketing executive imposter in the second season of the Canadian TV series, &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, a role that continued for several episodes. The show has run in the United States on the Sundance Channel.

Outside Canada, Feore has appeared in numerous film, theatre and television roles. He is perhaps most famous in the United States for his supporting roles in such Hollywood films as &quot;Chicago&quot;, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot;, &quot;Paycheck&quot;, and &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. In 1999, he appeared in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; as the powerful ancient wizard Andre Linoge. He was the crooked Los Angeles Police Chief James E. Davis in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Changeling&quot;. In 2011, he appeared as Laufey, King of the Frost Giants, in the live-action superhero film &quot;Thor&quot;. In 2014, he portrayed Dr. Francis Dulmacher in &quot;Gotham&quot;. He portrayed the First Gentleman Henry Taylor on the seventh season of &quot;24&quot;, appeared as Tad Whitney in &quot;The West Wing&quot; second-season episode titled &quot;Galileo&quot; and played the billionaire suspect Jordan Hayes in the 2011 &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; episode &quot;Flight&quot;. He played supernatural murderers in two episodes of &quot;Friday the 13th: The Series&quot;.

==Honours==
On June 8, 2002, Feore received an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree (D.Hum.) from the University of Windsor in Windsor. In October 2012, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree (D.Litt.) by Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, in recognition of his contributions to Canadian theatre and film.

Feore was honoured with Gascon-Thomas Award from the National Theatre School of Canada in 2013, the award is given annually to an actor that makes an exceptional contribution to the growth of theatre. In the same year, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC) &quot;for his contributions as an actor of the stage and screen, notably by bridging Anglophone and Francophone cultures as a fluently bilingual performer.&quot;
In 2019, Feore received the Lifetime Artistic Achievement Award in Film from the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards. He won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 9th Canadian Screen Awards in 2021, for the film &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot;.
==Personal life==
Feore has been married to Donna Feore (née Starnes), a choreographer and theatre director associated with the National Arts Centre and the Stratford Festival, since 1994. He was previously married to actress Sidonie Boll, whom he met at the National Theatre School, from 1983 to 1994. Feore has three children: son Jack with Boll, and son Thomas and daughter Anna with Donna Feore.

Feore is fluent in French.

<text>The Sopwith TF.2 Salamander was a British ground-attack aircraft of the First World War designed by the Sopwith Aviation Company which first flew in April 1918. It was a single-engined, single-seat biplane, based on the Sopwith Snipe fighter, with an armoured forward fuselage to protect the pilot and fuel system from ground fire during low level operations. It was ordered in large numbers for the Royal Air Force but the war ended before the type could enter squadron service, although two were in France in October 1918.

==Design and development==
In August 1917, the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) introduced the coordinated mass use of single-seat fighter aircraft for low-level ground-attack operations in support of the Third Battle of Ypres, with Airco DH.5s, which were unsuitable for high-altitude combat, specialising in this role. The tactic proved effective and was repeated at the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 by DH.5s and Sopwith Camels being used in strafing attacks. While the tactic proved successful, losses of the unarmoured fighters proved to be extremely high, reaching up to 30 per cent per day. Most losses were due to ground fire, although low-flying aircraft also proved vulnerable to attacks from above by enemy fighters. Two-seat German fighters such as Halberstadt CL.II, originally designed as escort fighters, were also used for ground-attack, playing an important role in the German counter-offensive at Cambrai. While the CL-type fighters were not armoured, the Germans also introduced more specialised heavily armoured two-seat aircraft such as the Junkers J.I for contact patrol and ground-attack work.

As a result of the high losses sustained during strafing and after seeing the success of the new German types, the RFC instructed the Sopwith Aviation Company to modify a Camel for close air support, by fitting downward-firing guns and armour. The modified Camel, known as the &quot;TF.1&quot; (trench fighter 1), flew on 15 February 1918. Two Lewis guns were fixed to fire downwards and forwards at an angle of 45 degrees and a third gun was mounted on the upper wing. The downward-firing guns proved to be of little use, being almost impossible to aim. The TF.1 did not go into production but information gained in testing it was used for the Salamander design.

Work on a more advanced armoured fighter, conceived as an armoured version of the Sopwith Snipe, began early in 1918. The forward portion of the fuselage was a 605 lb (275 kg) box of armour plate, forming an integral part of the aircraft structure, protecting the pilot and fuel system, with a 0.315 in (8 mm) front plate, a 0.433 in (11 mm) bottom plate, 0.236 in (6 mm) side plates and rear armour consisting of an 11-gauge and 6-gauge plate separated by an air gap. The rear (unarmoured) section of the fuselage was a generally similar structure to the Snipe but flat sided, to match the forepart. The two-bay wings and tailplane were identical in form to those of the Snipe but were strengthened to cope with the extra weight, while the fin and rudder were identical to the Snipe. The new aircraft used the same Bentley BR2 rotary engine as the Snipe, covered by an unarmoured cowling – the foremost armour plate forming the firewall.
Originally an armament of three machine guns was planned, with two Lewis guns firing forwards and downwards through the cockpit floor as in the TF.1, and a forward firing Vickers machine gun. This was changed to a conventional battery of two synchronised Vickers guns in front of the cockpit, as on the Snipe, before the first prototype was complete. The guns were staggered, with the starboard gun mounted a few inches forward of the port one to give more room for ammunition. Four light bombs could also be carried.

The first prototype started flight tests at Brooklands aerodrome on 27 April 1918 and was sent to France for evaluation on 9 May. It was wrecked in a crash on 19 May while being flown by No. 65 Squadron when the pilot had to avoid a tender crossing the aerodrome responding to another crash. While the Salamander was generally considered promising in the ground-attack role, lateral control was recognised as poor. To rectify these problems, the Salamander underwent many of the same modifications to the tail and ailerons as the Snipe.

==Service history==
Production was intended to be on a very large scale – an initial order for 500 aircraft was placed with Sopwith on 18 June, followed by additional orders with Wolseley Motors, the Air Navigation Co., Glendower Aircraft, Palladium Motors and the National Aircraft Factory No. 1. A total of 1,400 Salamanders were ordered. Production was slowed, however, by problems producing the armour plate, this being prone to distortion during the hardening process, and shortages of the BR.2 engine. By the end of October 1918 only 37 Salamanders were on RAF charge, and just two of these were in France. The first Salamander-equipped squadron, 157 Squadron, was due to fly out to France with 24 aircraft on 21 November, with more squadrons in the process of forming in the United Kingdom.

With the Armistice, the immediate need for a specialist close support aircraft evaporated, and 157 Squadron was quickly disbanded. Production continued for several months following the Armistice, with at least 497 completed. It was discovered postwar that 70 Salamanders had been fitted with Sopwith Snipe wings instead of the stronger wings of the Salamander, rendering the aircraft unsafe, while the armoured section was subject to spontaneous distortion, misaligning the airframe and again making the aircraft dangerous. The Salamander was used in trials of various patterns of disruptive camouflage in 1919, while some Salamanders were still in use at Heliopolis, Egypt in 1922. One example went to America, and was still in existence at McCook Field in 1926.

<text>Christian Hugo Eduard Study ( ; 23 March 1862 – 6 January 1930) was a German mathematician known for work on invariant theory of ternary forms (1889) and for the study of spherical trigonometry. He is also known for contributions to space geometry, hypercomplex numbers, and criticism of early physical chemistry.

Study was born in Coburg in the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.

==Career==
Eduard Study began his studies in Jena, Strasbourg, Leipzig, and Munich. He loved to study biology, especially entomology. He was awarded the doctorate in mathematics at the University of Munich in 1884. Paul Gordan, an expert in invariant theory was at Leipzig, and Study returned there as Privatdozent. In 1888 he moved to Marburg and in 1893 embarked on a speaking tour in the U.S.A. He appeared at a Congress of Mathematicians in Chicago as part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition and took part in mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. Back in Germany, in 1894, he was appointed extraordinary professor at Göttingen. Then he gained the rank of full professor in 1897 at Greifswald. In 1904 he was called to the University of Bonn as the position held by Rudolf Lipschitz was vacant. There he settled until retirement in 1927.

Study gave a plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1904 at Heidelberg and another in 1912 at Cambridge, UK.

==Euclidean space group and dual quaternions==
In 1891 Eduard Study published &quot;Of Motions and Translations, in two parts&quot;. It treats the Euclidean group E(3). The second part of his article
introduces the associative algebra of dual quaternions, that is numbers

:formula_1

where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;d&quot; are dual numbers and {1, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;} multiply as in the quaternion group. Actually Study uses notation such that

:formula_2

:formula_3

The multiplication table is found on page 520 of volume 39 (1891) in Mathematische Annalen under the title &quot;Von Bewegungen und Umlegungen, I. und II. Abhandlungen&quot;.
Eduard Study cites William Kingdon Clifford as an earlier source on these biquaternions. In 1901 Study published &quot;Geometrie der Dynamen&quot; also using dual quaternions. In 1913 he wrote a review article treating both E(3) and elliptic geometry. This article, &quot;Foundations and goals of analytical kinematics&quot; develops the field of kinematics, in particular exhibiting an element of E(3) as a homography of dual quaternions.

Study&#x27;s use of abstract algebra was noted in &quot;A History of Algebra&quot; (1985) by B. L. van der Waerden. On the other hand, Joe Rooney recounts these developments in relation to kinematics.

==Hypercomplex numbers==

Study showed an early interest in systems of complex numbers and their application to transformation groups with his article in 1890. He addressed this popular subject again in 1898 in &quot;Klein&#x27;s encyclopedia&quot;. The essay explored quaternions and other hypercomplex number systems. This 34 page article was expanded to 138 pages in 1908 by Élie Cartan, who surveyed the hypercomplex systems in &quot;Encyclopédie des sciences mathématiques pures et appliqueés&quot;. Cartan acknowledged Eduard Study&#x27;s guidance, in his title, with the words &quot;after Eduard Study&quot;.

In the 1993 biography of Cartan by Akivis and Rosenfeld, one reads:
: [Study] defined the algebra °H of &#x27;semiquaternions&#x27; with the units 1, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ε&quot;, &quot;η&quot; having the properties formula_4
: Semiquaternions are often called &#x27;Study&#x27;s quaternions&#x27;.

In 1985 Helmut Karzel and Günter Kist developed &quot;Study&#x27;s quaternions&quot; as the kinematic algebra corresponding to the group of motions of the Euclidean plane. These quaternions arise in &quot;Kinematic algebras and their geometries&quot; alongside ordinary quaternions and the ring of 2×2 real matrices which Karzel and Kist cast as the kinematic algebras of the elliptic plane and hyperbolic plane respectively. See the &quot;Motivation and Historical Review&quot; at page 437 of &quot;Rings and Geometry&quot;, R. Kaya editor.

Some of the other hypercomplex systems that Study worked with are dual numbers, dual quaternions, and split-biquaternions, all being
associative algebras over R.

==Ruled surfaces==
Study&#x27;s work with dual numbers and line coordinates was noted by Heinrich Guggenheimer in 1963 in his book &quot;Differential Geometry&quot; (see pages 162–5). He cites and proves the following theorem of Study: The oriented lines in R3 are in one-to-one correspondence with the points of the dual unit sphere in D3. Later he says &quot;A differentiable curve A(&quot;u&quot;) on the dual unit sphere, depending on a &quot;real&quot; parameter &quot;u&quot;, represents a differentiable family of straight lines in R3: a ruled surface. The lines A(&quot;u&quot;) are the &quot;generators&quot; or &quot;rulings&quot; of the surface.&quot; Guggenheimer also shows the representation of the Euclidean motions in R3 by orthogonal dual matrices.

==Hermitian form metric==
In 1905 Study wrote &quot;Kürzeste Wege im komplexen Gebiet&quot; (Shortest paths in the complex domain) for Mathematische Annalen (60:321–378). Some of its contents were anticipated by Guido Fubini a year before. The distance Study refers to is a Hermitian form on complex projective space. Since then this metric has been called the Fubini–Study metric. Study was careful in 1905 to distinguish the hyperbolic and elliptic cases in Hermitian geometry.

==Valence theory==
Somewhat surprisingly Eduard Study is known by practitioners of quantum chemistry. Like James Joseph Sylvester, Paul Gordan believed that invariant theory could contribute to the understanding of chemical valence. In 1900 Gordan and his student G. Alexejeff contributed an article on an analogy between the coupling problem for angular momenta and their work on invariant theory to the &quot;Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie&quot; (v. 35, p. 610). In 2006 Wormer and Paldus summarized Study&#x27;s role as follows:
: The analogy, lacking a physical basis at the time, was criticised heavily by the mathematician E. Study and ignored completely by the chemistry community of the 1890s. After the advent of quantum mechanics it became clear, however, that chemical valences arise from electron–spin couplings ... and that electron spin functions are, in fact, binary forms of the type studied by Gordan and Clebsch.

<text>Blacklick Creek is a tributary of the Conemaugh River, approximately 30 mi (48 km) long, in western Pennsylvania in the United States.

It rises in two forks in western Cambria County, on the western side of the Allegheny Mountains. The North Branch, approximately 12 mi (19 km) long, rises north of Colver and flows west, then southwest. The South Branch rises near Revloc and flows west. The branches meet at Rexis, near the boundary between Cambria and Indiana counties. The main branch flows west, receiving Two Lick Creek near Josephine, approximately 10 mi (16 km) SSW of Indiana, then WSW to join the Conemaugh approximately 3 mi (5 km) WNW of Blairsville.

The name, which is also the name of the township that contains most of the northern branch and part of the southern branch, probably refers to the fact that the stream (or &quot;lick&quot;) often passes over outcroppings of coal (&quot;black&quot; minerals) in its bed and its banks.

<text>Adolf Eugen Fick (3 September 1829 – 21 August 1901) was a German-born physician and physiologist.

==Early life and education==
Fick began his work in the formal study of mathematics and physics before realising an aptitude for medicine. He then earned his doctorate in medicine from the University of Marburg in 1851. As a fresh medical graduate, he began his work as a prosector. He died in Flanders at age 71.

==Career==
In 1855, he introduced Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion, which govern the diffusion of a gas across a fluid membrane. In 1870, he was the first to measure cardiac output, using what is now called the Fick principle.

Fick managed to double-publish his law of diffusion, as it applied equally to physiology and physics. His work led to the development of the direct Fick method for measuring cardiac output.

==Anecdotal==
Fick&#x27;s nephew, Adolf Gaston Eugen Fick, invented the contact lens.

<doc id="664004" wikidata="Q428936" url="?curid=664004" title="Animusic">
<text>Animusic, LLC is a dormant animation company specializing in the 3D visualization of MIDI-based music. Founded by Wayne Lytle in 1990, it is currently a registered limited liability company in New York and had offices in Texas and California during its active stages. The initial name of the company was Visual Music, but was changed to Animusic in 1995.

The company is known for its &quot;Animusic&quot; compilations of computer-generated animations, based on MIDI events processed to simultaneously drive the music and on-screen action, leading to and corresponding to every sound. The animated short &quot;Pipe Dream,&quot; showed at SIGGRAPH&#x27;s Electronic Theater in 2001, details the use of this specific sequencing.

Unlike many other music visualizations, Animusic uses MIDI information to drive the animation, while other 3D programs animate figures or characters to the music. Any animated models in &quot;Animusic&quot; are created first, and are then programmed to follow what the music, or MIDI information, instructs them to do.

Many of the instruments appear to be robotic or play themselves using seemingly curious methods to produce and visualize the original compositions. The animations typically feature dramatically-lit rooms or landscapes in rustic and/or futuristic locales.

The music in &quot;Animusic&quot; is principally pop-rock based, consisting of straightforward sequences of triggered samples and digital patches. According to the director&#x27;s commentary track on &quot;Animusic 2&quot;, most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation (see Software Programs for more info). Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their timbre.

==Releases==
, three video albums have been released.

*&quot;Animusic: A Computer Animation Video Album&quot; (2001, re-issued as &quot;special edition&quot; in 2004)
*&quot;Animusic 2: A New Computer Animation Video Album&quot; (2005)
*&quot;Animusic HD: Stunning Computer-Animated Music&quot; (2010)

&quot;Animusic&quot; was released in 2001 on VHS, and later DVD, with a special edition DVD being released later in 2004. This special edition included extra material, such as Animusic&#x27;s first animation, &quot;Beyond the Walls&quot;. A second album, &quot;Animusic 2&quot;, was released in the United States in 2005. Later, in 2008, this volume received a Japanese localization through a distribution deal with Japanese company Jorudan, Co. Ltd. In a company newsletter, it was announced that the Animusic company would also be producing a high-definition version of &quot;Animusic 2&quot; on Blu-ray, to be released sometime before their third major album, &quot;Animusic 3&quot;. This HD compilation was eventually released in November 2010, featuring all of the animations featured in &quot;Animusic 2&quot;, as well as the animation &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; from &quot;Animusic&quot; encoded at a high bitrate. In a later newsletter, the working titles of three animations in &quot;Animusic 3&quot;, “Sonic Warfare”, “Paddle Ball” and “Super Pipe Dream”, were revealed. In 2012, a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Animusic 3&quot; was successfully funded. &quot;The Sound of Twelve,&quot; a music-only album made using similar harmonics as &quot;Animusic,&quot; was released in March 2015. Animusic 3 was never finished or released.

In the mid-2000&#x27;s, a viral hoax email suggested that the &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; video was actually a machine created at the University of Iowa from farm machinery parts. Although this has been proven false, the hoax was still considered &quot;pretty amusing&quot; to the Animusic staff. It is currently unknown who started the hoax. Intel later commissioned a version of the machine to be built which was demonstrated at IDF 2011.

=== Animusic 3 ===
Animusic, in its former state with multiple employees, was working on the third volume of the &quot;Animusic&quot; series for over 10 years. It was initially intended to be released sometime in 2010, featuring animations such as &quot;Sonic Warfare&quot;, &quot;Paddle Ball&quot;, and &quot;Super Pipe Dream&quot;. However, this release date passed with no definitive word regarding the volume&#x27;s progress. A year later in November 2010, Animusic attributed this delay to a complete restructuring of their modeling and rendering software, ultimately yielding the Animusic|Studio software program.

On August 6, 2012, the company began a Kickstarter campaign aimed at raising $200,000 USD to fund the completion of the &quot;Animusic 3&quot;. This campaign was featured on several websites such as Animation World Network. A rough mix from the newly revealed music album &quot;The Sound of 12&quot;, titled &quot;Glarpedge,&quot; was released online on August 28, 2012. On August 31, 2012, two more mixes were released: &quot;Emoticondria&quot; and &quot;EchoKrunch.&quot; The Kickstarter page was later updated to confirm that a Blu-ray edition of &quot;Animusic 3&quot; would be released shortly following the DVD&#x27;s completion.

On September 5, 2012, the Kickstarter campaign ended successfully, with a final backing amount of $223,123. Animusic posted expected shipping dates of October 2013 for the DVD, and February 2014 for the Blu-ray disc. However, both dates passed without either product being released.

On a Kickstarter update in August 2015, Wayne Lytle announced some other factors that have delayed the project, including Dave Crognale&#x27;s departure from the project and new residence in California, personal struggles, and physical stress and injury. To make up for this, the team utilized the distribution of supplemental prizes for backers to try and ease those who had funded the campaign, and assure them that there would be a quick resolution. Lytle had noted in this particular update that his financial situation was so unfortunate to the point where he, his mother and father, and his wife were unable to pay for shipping postage for the remainder of the inventory. However, Lytle insisted on his determination to finish the project, expressing his excitement about the abilities of the newly-implemented Unreal Engine 4 and his gratitude for those who have invested in him. Lytle stated that he had withheld from posting an update until he had a completion date, but did not give one in the update.

Since the 2015 Kickstarter update, no further updates have been posted on the platform. In August 2017, the Animusic headquarters was sold to RP Solutions, Inc.

In August 2019, the Animusic website was briefly taken down, and replaced by a generic template with a small explanation that the site is undergoing a redesign.

According to the New York State Division of Corporations, State Records, and UCC, Animusic is still an active domestic limited liability company and is registered to an address in Cortland, New York. The status of Wayne Lytle is publicly unknown; however, the Cortland property that the limited liability company is registered under has been sold as of November, 2021.

==Software programs==
According to the company&#x27;s FAQ, animation is created procedurally with their own proprietary MIDImotion engine. Discreet 3D Studio Max was used for modeling, lighting, cameras, and rendering. Maps were painted with Corel Painter, Deep Paint 3D, and Photoshop. They have also created their own software called ANIMUSIC|studio that is based on scene-graph technology. According to an August 2015 newsletter, Animusic was using Unreal Engine 4 for the production of &quot;Animusic 3&quot;.

== Animations ==

* Various animations for SIGGRAPH
* &quot;More Bells and Whistles&quot; (1990) – made by Wayne Lytle before creating Animusic
* &quot;Beyond the Walls&quot; (known as &quot;Concerto in 3D&quot; if watched in stereoscopic 3D) (1996) – the first animation made under the name of Animusic, produced for VRex (a manufacturer of stereoscopic glasses and projectors). This animation is included as a bonus feature on the &quot;Animusic&quot; special edition DVD.
* &quot;Kansas – Device, Voice, Drum&quot; (2002) – animation for an intro to the band&#x27;s concert and a music-only bridge in one of the tracks &quot;Miracles Out of Nowhere&quot;; album cover.

<doc id="664005" wikidata="Q588636" url="?curid=664005" title="Amethi">
<text>Amethi is a city situated in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Gauriganj is the administrative headquarters of the Amethi district. This district is a part of Ayodhya division in the Awadh region of the state. Amethi was 72nd district of Uttar Pradesh which came into existence on 1 July 2010 by merging three tehsils of the erstwhile Sultanpur district namely Amethi, Gauriganj and Musafirkhana and two tehsils of the erstwhile Raebareli district, namely, Salon and Tiloi. The town is part of the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency and Amethi Assembly constituency, which became reputed as a stronghold of the Indian National Congress party. The Congress leaders belonging to Nehru-Gandhi family won several elections from Amethi during 1980–2014. In 2019, Smriti Irani of Bhartiya Janta Party won this seat. Irani was defeated in 2024 by Kishori Lal Sharma of Indian National Congress.

==History==
In the past, Amethi used to be called Raipur-Amethi. When the train station was built here, it took the name of Amethi, but before then there had been no settlement with that exact name. There had been a &quot;mahal&quot; or pargana of Amethi since at least the time of Akbar: it is mentioned in the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; as belonging to the sarkar of Lucknow, with a brick fort at headquarters and was held by Rajputs called &quot;Bahmangoti&quot;s, who are the same as the Bandhalgoti Rajputs from whom the Rajas of Amethi originated. Later on, the pargana was transferred to Manikpur.

The capital region of the Amethi estate, Raipur, which was formerly known as Badagaon, lost much of its power, strength, and splendor after the establishment of the Kohra (estate) by Babu Himmat Sah. He was the younger son of Raja Bikram Sah of Amethi estate. His descendant, Babu Bhoop Singh, became one of the most important leaders in the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and played a crucial role in the Awadh War of 1857.
===The Rajas of Amethi===
The Bandhalgoti Kachhwaha Rajas of Amethi originally resided at Raipur Phulwari, which along with Sarwanpur and Katra Himmat Singh, was one of the three villages that would later be amalgamated into the modern town of Raipur-Amethi. The old fort at Raipur Phulwari was destroyed by Safdar Jang c. 1743; its ruins are still visible today.

The story behind its destruction is as follows: the King of Amethi Raja Gurdatt Singh had defied Safdar Jang&#x27;s authority so conspicuously that Safdar Jang personally led an army to Raipur to besiege the fort.

After a siege of 18 days, Gurdatt Singh fled into the neighbouring jungle of Ramnagar (which became the rajas&#x27; main residence), and the fort was destroyed and his estate (then known as Udiawan, until the British annexation of Awadh) put under Safdar Jang&#x27;s direct control.

Raja Gurdatt Singh&#x27;s son Raja Drigpal Singh was able to recover his father&#x27;s estate. While Raja Gurdatt Singh had been known by various titles, all his successors beginning with Drigpal Singh were unequivocally styled Raja. Because of the prevalence of barren &quot;usar&quot; land in the pargana, there was a popular saying gar na hota Amethi úsar, Rája hota deoti dusar, meaning &quot;if there had been no &quot;usar&quot; in Amethi, the Raja would be a second deity&quot;.

The taluqa was then divided between Drigpal Singh&#x27;s two sons, with Har Chand Singh receiving the bulk of the inheritance and Jai Chand Singh founding the junior branch of Kannu Kasrawan. Har Chand Singh had originally inherited 153 villages but in 1804 was permitted to engage for the entire pargana of Amethi (except for the village of Raghipur). In 1810, this arrangement was changed by Saadat Ali Khan II, leaving Har Chand Singh with just 43 rent-free villages; he abdicated in favour of his son Dalpat Sah, who in 1813 was able to restore the taluqa to its original extent. Dalpat Sah died in 1815 and was succeeded by his son Bisheshar Singh, who then died childless in 1842.

At this point, the taluqa was inherited by Bisheshar Singh&#x27;s cousin Madho Singh, whose father Arjun Singh (Dalpat&#x27;s brother) had held the independent Gangoli estate as a junior branch. Under Madho Singh, these two branches became united. Madho Singh clashed with the &quot;nazim&quot; of Sultanpur, Maharaja Man Singh, in 1845; when this proved indecisive, the two parties turned to negotiations. The resulting agreement in 1846 ended up leasing the entire pargana to Madho Singh except for a few villages that would be directly retained by the nazim.

This lease included Kannu Kasrawan, still held by Jai Chand Singh&#x27;s descendants, but the proprietors ignored the terms and Madho Singh ended up getting a decree of confiscation from the Nawab of Awadh himself. After protracted fighting the proprietors finally submitted in 1853.

The Udiawan taluqa was almost completely broken up upon the British annexation in 1856, but reconstituted after the 1857 uprising. Madho Singh supported the rebellion but the British were still willing to give him a &quot;sanad&quot; for the estate; they also formally acknowledged his title of Raja (he had never really sought formal recognition beforehand). Madho died in August 1891, shortly after the death of his only son, and was succeeded by a more distant relative who was adopted as his heir. At the turn of the 20th century, the Amethi estate consisted of 314 villages and 4 pattis, all in the pargana of Amethi.

===Growth of the modern town===
Amethi&#x27;s development as a major town is because of the coming of the railway. As late as 1897, a British settlement officer wrote &quot;Raipur is a collection of small unimportant hamlets, with positively no attempt at trade.&quot; That changed when the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway came to town with a station in 1898. The town then rapidly grew in size and commercial importance, and as early as 1903 it was already described as &quot;a flourishing town&quot; and the previous description was described as &quot;already ancient history&quot;.

As of 1901 the population was 3,688 including 1,127 Muslims which was an especially large proportion for the area. It contained the tehsil headquarters, a school, a police station, a pound, and a dispensary.

Raipur is the place where the first fort of Bandhalgoti Rajas was located. His ancestors used to reside in Raipur which is now Raipur Phulwari. New fort was built in Ram Nagar about north of present Amethi which had been Center of Political activities during freedom movement. It is inhabited by Ex MP Sanjaya Sinh and Ex MLA Garima Singh. Amethi became known worldwide with Sanjay Gandhi contesting Parliamentary Election on the behest of Raja Rananjay Singh who had close relationship with Nehru family. It is also famous for the Hanuman temple called (Hanumangarhi) and a mosque both built about hundred years ago. About 7 kilometres north of Amethi there is a tomb of famous Poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi (best remembered for his epic composition Padmavat) at Magravan which is near Ram Nagar, where he died. Present fort was built by Bandhalgoti Rajas.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census, Amethi has a population of 13,849 people, in 2,262 households. The town&#x27;s sex ratio is 965 females to every 1000 males; 7,049 of Amethi&#x27;s residents are male (50.9%) and 6,800 are female (49.1%). The 0-6 age group numbered 1,731, or about 12.5% of the town&#x27;s population; the sex ratio for this group was 987. Members of Scheduled Castes make up 12.87% of the town&#x27;s population, while no members of Scheduled Tribes were recorded. Amethi&#x27;s literacy rate was 78.3% (counting only people age 7 and up); literacy was higher among men and boys (86.01%) than among women and girls (70.27%). The scheduled castes literacy rate is 60.73% (71.95% among men and boys, and 48.25% among women and girls).

In terms of employment, 21.29% of Amethi residents were classified as main workers (i.e. people employed for at least 6 months per year) in 2011. Marginal workers (i.e. people employed for less than 6 months per year) made up 6.27%, and the remaining 72.44% were non-workers. Employment status varied significantly according to gender, with 44.76% of men being either main or marginal workers, compared to only 9.74% of women.

As per the 2001 Census of India, Amethi had a population of 12,808. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Amethi has an average literacy rate of 59%, lower than the national average of 59.5%; with 59% of the males and 41% of females literate. 17% of the population is under 6 years of age.

<text>Guilty as Sin is a 1993 American legal thriller film written by Larry Cohen, directed by Sidney Lumet and produced by Martin Ransohoff. It stars Rebecca De Mornay and Don Johnson, and was produced by Hollywood Pictures.

==Plot==
Jennifer Haines (Rebecca De Mornay) is an up-and-coming Chicago attorney. She wins a big case, celebrates with the man in her life, Phil Garson (Stephen Lang), and returns to work to a hero&#x27;s reception.

Into her life walks David Greenhill (Don Johnson), who was seated in the gallery during her previous trial. Greenhill is a debonair and arrogant ladies&#x27; man who stands accused of murdering his wealthy wife, Rita (Brigitte Wilson). He wants Haines to represent him, but she declines.

Something about him intrigues her, though, so the equally arrogant Haines has second thoughts. She tells her law firm&#x27;s superiors that this promises to be a high-profile trial and she wants it because: &quot;I am that good.&quot;

Greenhill maintains his innocence but shows signs of irrational behavior that make Haines wary of him. She assigns her longtime investigator Moe (Jack Warden) to do some digging and he begins to unearth the defendant&#x27;s shady past. Greenhill in the meantime starts showing up unexpectedly in Haines&#x27;s social life, stalking her and dropping hints that something is going on between them.

Phil dislikes the guy intensely and demands Haines drop him as a client. She doesn&#x27;t care for Greenhill either but resents being told what to do. She refuses to quit his case until her law partners notify her that the fee Greenhill promised remains unpaid. An unsympathetic judge (Dana Ivey) tells Haines it&#x27;s her own fault and refuses to let her abandon her client.

Learning from Moe that Greenhill has a history of dating older women who usually end up dead, a horrified Haines wants to turn him in, but is bound to attorney-client privilege. She instead tries to sabotage her own case by having evidence planted at Greenhill&#x27;s apartment, hoping that it will lead to his conviction. He knows she must be behind it and takes his revenge by viciously assaulting Phil, who ends up hospitalized.

Greenhill&#x27;s case ends in a mistrial, after the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict. Greenhill, seemingly pleased, displays regret that he never had a chance to take the stand. He does so privately for Haines in the empty courtroom, revealing that he had been scouting her far in advance of the murder case. He confesses that he did indeed kill his wife and provides vivid details.

Greenhill further tells Haines that he knows she planted the evidence. He could use this to blackmail her, but says he has come to tire of her. Haines fears the psychopathic Greenhill will now come after her. She prepares to disclose everything, even at the cost of her career.

Greenhill anticipates this. He murders Moe, knocking him out and then setting fire to his office. He then intercepts Haines at her apartment building. He casually states that between Phil&#x27;s beating and Moe&#x27;s death, she is grieving enough to commit suicide. A fierce struggle ensues. Greenhill manages to throw Haines over a railing, but to his horror, she pulls him down with her. They fall several stories together. Greenhill is killed in the fall. Haines, cushioned by his body, is severely injured but survives.

As she is carried off to the hospital, she triumphantly states: &quot;I beat him, Phil. I beat him. Tough way to win a case.&quot;

<text>The Legislative Assembly of Alberta is the deliberative assembly of the province of Alberta, Canada. It sits in the Alberta Legislature Building in Edmonton. Since 2012 the Legislative Assembly has had 87 members, elected first past the post from single-member electoral districts. Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor of Alberta, as the viceregal representative of the King of Canada. The Legislative Assembly and the Lieutenant Governor together make up the unicameral Alberta Legislature.

The maximum period between general elections of the assembly, as set by Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is five years, which is further reinforced in Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Legislative Assembly Act&quot;. Convention dictates the premier controls the date of election and usually selects a date in the fourth or fifth year after the preceding election. Amendments to Alberta&#x27;s &quot;Election Act&quot; introduced in 2024 fixed the date of election to the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year following the preceding election. Alberta has never had a minority government and an election as a result of a vote of no confidence has never occurred.

To be a candidate for election to the assembly, a person must be a Canadian citizen older than 18 who has lived in Alberta for at least six months before the election and has registered with Elections Alberta under the &quot;Election Finances and Contributions Disclosure Act&quot;. Senators, senators-in-waiting, members of the House of Commons, and criminal inmates are ineligible.

The 30th Alberta Legislature was dissolved on May 1, 2023. The members-elect of the 31st Alberta Legislature were elected on May 29.

==History==

The first session of the first Legislature of Alberta opened on March 15, 1906, in the Thistle Rink, Edmonton, north of Jasper Avenue. After the speech from the throne, the assembly held its sessions in the McKay Avenue School. In this school Alberta MLAs chose the provincial capital, Edmonton, and the future site for the Alberta Legislature Building: the bank of the North Saskatchewan River. Allan Merrick Jeffers, a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design was the architect who was chosen to build the assembly building. In September 1912 Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Governor General of Canada, declared the building officially open.

Louise McKinney and Roberta MacAdams were the first women elected to the assembly, in the 1917 election. They were also the first women in any legislature of the British Empire.

==Current members ==
The members of the 31st Alberta Legislature were elected in the 31st Alberta general election held on May 29, 2023. Bold indicates cabinet members, and &quot;party leaders&quot; are &quot;italicized&quot;.

<text>The Owl (Leland Owlsley) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is depicted usually as an enemy of the superheroes Daredevil, Spider-Man and Black Cat. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Joe Orlando, the character first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #3 (August 1964).

The character has appeared in numerous media adaptations, including the television series &quot;Daredevil&quot;, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe in which he was played by Bob Gunton.

==Publication history==
The character first appeared in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #3 (August 1964). He was a recurring foe of Daredevil during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, he has made occasional appearances in various Marvel titles, against such superheroes as Spider-Man, and has faced Daredevil again.

Originally Bob Layton, writer of the first five issues of &quot;X-Factor&quot;, had intended to use the Owl as the Alliance of Evil&#x27;s mysterious master (mentioned in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #4 (May 1986). The final page of &quot;X-Factor&quot; #5 initially featured the Owl, but as Layton was removed from the book and replaced with Louise Simonson, the final page was changed to feature a new character named Apocalypse instead, as Simonson and editor Bob Harras wanted a new villain for the book.

==Fictional character biography==
Leland Owlsley was once a successful financier and financial investor, nicknamed &quot;The Owl of Wall Street&quot; for his financial acumen, until evidence of his tax evasion and crooked business deals were exposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Rather than fight the charges, he fled to a hideout across the Hudson River and pursued a new career as a crime lord. The Owl had already been pooling a percentage of his earnings into researching superpowered enhancements; the result was a serum that enhanced his physical prowess and gave him the ability to fly. He subsequently employed two enforcers and captured Daredevil in a chance encounter, planning to kill him at a meeting of underworld bosses in order to make himself the undisputed overlord of crime. However, Daredevil escaped and confronted the Owl in battle. Eventually determining that he could not defeat Daredevil unarmed and alone, he fled, escaping his foe in the river. When he came to shore, Owl was captured by police, convicted, and sentenced to prison by Judge Lewis.

Following an escape, the Owl established a new hideout on a volcanic isle and kidnapped Judge Lewis and Matt Murdock (Daredevil&#x27;s alter ego), forcing them to participate in a sham trial with Murdock forced to defend Lewis. With a clever distraction, the lawyer was able to change into Daredevil. The Owl&#x27;s second confrontation with his nemesis ended in a draw, and both were forced to flee the erupting island. He was later freed from prison by Mr. Kline, who ordered him to capture Daredevil. Learning from their previous encounters, the Owl finally overcame Daredevil and sent him plummeting to his death. However, the vigilante was saved by Black Widow, and the two of them worked together to thwart the Owl&#x27;s planned heist of the San Francisco public treasury. The Owl then moved to Chicago with a scheme to siphon valuable knowledge from the brains of his victims, and battled the Cat. The Owl returned to San Francisco, and briefly captured Daredevil and the Black Widow. The Owl was later stricken with a debilitating ailment resulting in the paralysis of his legs. He returned to New York and recruited the Man-Bull. The Owl attempted to kidnap a neurologist to cure his ailment but was foiled by Daredevil.

The Owl was later rescued by his henchmen and fitted with a neurological pacemaker to cure his ailment. He battled Daredevil and Spider-Man and was incapacitated when his pacemaker short-circuited. The Owl was confined to a life-support module designed by the Maggia. He schemed to loot New York under cover of a citywide blackout, but was captured by Spider-Man, the Black Widow, and Simon Stroud. No longer confined to the module, the Owl later engaged in a gang war against Doctor Octopus in an attempt to usurp the Kingpin&#x27;s position as the crime boss of New York&#x27;s underworld. The Owl encountered Spider-Man and the Black Cat, and was beaten by Doctor Octopus.

The Owl was later mystically summoned to Winnipeg, Canada, by Llan the Sorcerer. There, he battled Alpha Flight and Gamma Flight with Nekra, the Asp, and the Scorpion.

The Owl was later among the criminals assembled by Doctor Doom to battle the Fantastic Four in Washington, D.C.

Over the years the Owl has become less and less human as a result of bizarre experiments he has subjected himself to in efforts to improve his natural ability to glide and repair damage to his spine that rendered him a paraplegic. The Owl once needed to use an exoskeleton to walk but has since recovered from this injury.

The Owl started to re-establish his presence in the criminal underworld in the absence of the Kingpin. When Spider-Man visits him regarding information about the kidnapping of May Parker, the Owl says that Electro and the Vulture kidnapped her. This turns out to be a ploy by the Owl, who is after the two villains (hiring the Black Cat to find them) for stealing from him. He began to enlarge his criminal empire by refining Mutant Growth Hormone from his own genetic material, though Daredevil was able to get him arrested.

He managed to manipulate behind the scenes and get the Kingpin arrested for a past murder when it looked like Fisk was going to make a deal with the FBI. The deal in question involved Matt Murdock being arrested for being Daredevil. When Foggy Nelson, representing Murdock in court, visited him in jail, he was apparently killed by the other prisoners. The Owl later taunted Murdock about this, and Murdock, who had become unhinged due to his friend&#x27;s death, brutally beat the Owl. Unbeknownst to the two of them, Foggy was alive at the time and in witness protection.

Later, the Owl escaped prison and stole Deathlok from S.H.I.E.L.D., killing four agents in the process. He sets up an auction in hopes of selling him off to the highest bidder to other supervillains. However, he did not ask permission from the Hood (the self-established &quot;Kingpin of Supervillains&quot;) and the Hood subsequently stole Deathlok from the Owl and shot the Owl.

The Owl has since then appeared in police custody. He was subsequently freed by the Kingpin, who sought to employ him as part of his plan to take revenge on The Hand. He took Dakota North captive and implied he would torture and sexually assault her in order to get information on Daredevil, who then appeared and cut every nerve in both his arms and legs using a sword the Owl had tried to attack him with.

Members of Owl&#x27;s gang were shown fighting in a gang war with the Maggia at a scrapyard. Hammerhead shoots the gang while Silvermane was fed to a metal crusher.

It was later revealed that Owl received his henchmen from Taskmaster who had trained them.

Owl was next seen purchasing a product called Ebony which came from the glands of Corruptor. He planned to synthesize it into a street drug only for Daredevil to arrive and steal it.

Owl attended a circus with Kingpin, Madame Masque, Tombstone, and Hammerhead when Hawkeye stole their money.

Owl&#x27;s gang later ended up in a gunfight with a gang led by the third White Dragon. Both Owl and White Dragon were brutally beaten up by the Superior Spider-Man (Otto Octavius&#x27;s mind in Spider-Man&#x27;s body). The remainder of Owl&#x27;s gang fled and were recruited by Goblin King to join the Goblin Nation.

The Sinister Six (consisting of Boomerang, Overdrive, Shocker, Speed Demon, and Beetle) assaulted Owl&#x27;s base. Overdrive and Speed Demon were captured by Owl and interrogated. Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them while covertly dialing for backup. Unimpressed, the Owl got ready to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone (who was revealed to be Beetle&#x27;s father).

After a series of failures Boomerang teams up with the Owl and forms the Sinister Sixteen in order to retrieve the picture of Doctor Doom that the former had stolen a few days before, and that was now in the hands of the Chameleon. The line-up consisted of the dregs of the underworld that Boomerang used as cannon fodder so that he could retrieve the painting.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, Owl is among the animal-themed characters captured by Taskmaster and Black Ant for Kraven the Hunter&#x27;s upcoming Great Hunt. He later watches the fight between Spider-Man and Scorpion until the Hunter-Bots arrive. He then joins Spider-Man and the other animal-themed characters in fleeing from the Hunter-Bots. Owl and the other animal-themed characters meet with Vulture where Spider-Man informs them about the loss of Gibbon and Mandrill while Toad mentions the loss of Man-Bull. When Kraven the Hunter has Arcade deactivated the forcefield, Owl is among the animal-themed characters that are freed.

Owl is among the crime lords competing with Mister Negative to obtain the Tablet of Life and Destiny in order to win the favor of Mayor Wilson Fisk.

Owl is among the crime lords that attended the wedding of Randy Robertson and Janice Lincoln where it was crashed by Shotgun who shot Tombstone. As Spider-Man goes after Shotgun, the crime lords blamed each other for calling the hit.

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, Owl attends a crime lord meeting. After Hammerhead states that his crime family is backed by Count Nefaria and Silvermane, Owl states that he will stand down for now. During a crime lord meeting at Arthur Avenue, Owl demanded to know who ran him out of Red Hook. Crime Master denies any knowledge of it to Owl. Elektra is visited by Owl who states that Madame Masque, Hobgoblin, Diamondback, the Heat, Lady Yulan, Mister Negative, Shang-Chi, and Ringmaster want control over New York City while also mentioning that someone has become the Heat&#x27;s benefactor. Before leaving, Owl tips off Elektra to a shipment that the Heat are expecting. Owl later visits Madame Masque informing her that he hedged the heroes as she instructed. When Madame Masque states that Owl doing that is crossing the line as she summons X-23&#x27;s clone Bellona to her side. Owl has a brief fight with Bellona until he sees her bring out her retractable claws. Owl is then thrown into the same cell as Count Nefaria, Hammerhead, and Silvermane. Madame Masque later mind-controlled Owl during the fight in Central Park and unleashed him on Spider-Man as he moved in to confront her. Spider-Man managed to defeat Owl.

==Powers and abilities==

The Owl has ingested a special serum which enabled him to naturally glide for short distances, though he has to leap from a height of at least off of the ground to do so. He is able to perform complex midair maneuvers while he glides which would be impossible for ordinary humans. The Owl&#x27;s gliding ability is assisted by a weak psionic ability to levitate his body. Under the right conditions, such as favorable air currents, the Owl can glide for at least the length of a city block. He uses specially designed capes to allow him to do this.

His bones are hollow, and he possesses a greater proportionate muscle mass than normal humans. Though the Owl only exercises moderately, his strength, endurance, resistance/resiliency to injury and fatigue, and reflexes/reactions are enhanced as a result of his mutation (he is physically stronger and tougher than any Olympic weightlifter). His vision and hearing are superhumanly acute, his head can rotate 180 degrees, and his eyes can move independently of each other in their own sockets and have greater visual range than an ordinary human. His teeth and nails are essentially fangs and talons which can tear through human flesh with relative ease. Most of his adversaries assume that he is just a normal human as he almost never engages in physical struggles; he relegates this to his underlings, like the Vulture and Electro.

Over the years the Owl has taken a number of experimental drugs and subjected himself to experimental surgical procedures to increase his ability to glide. These experiments have met with mixed results and a by-product of them is that he has been mutagenically altered in a way that has negatively affected his sanity and made him more animal-like. For instance, he enjoys eating live mice with his vintage six-hundred-dollar wine. It also paralyzed him down the waist for some time, making him unable to stand or walk without a special leg-brace exoskeleton.

The Owl wears a set of metal razor-sharp steel-tool talons attached to each forearm (closely resembling Wolverine&#x27;s claws) and a specially designed cape designed to resemble an owl&#x27;s outstretched wings to assist him in steering during flight, and often uses various other bird-themed weapons and pieces of equipment. This special equipment was designed for him by the Tinkerer. Although the Owl is somewhat deranged, he is an extremely skilled criminal organizer and money launderer.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===
In the alternate timeline of the 1995–1996 &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, the Owl is a member of the Marauders, a terrorist group composed of humans who have betrayed humanity and joined Apocalypse. This incarnation of the Owl is killed by Gwen Stacy and Clint Barton, alongside fellow Marauders members Dirigible, Red and Arcade.

===Age of Ultron===
During the 2013 &quot;Age of Ultron&quot; storyline, Owl and Hammerhead captured the Superior Spider-Man and hoped to trade him with Ultron. Hawkeye came to Superior Spider-Man&#x27;s rescue as the Ultron Sentinels attacked.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the alternate universe of Marvel Zombies, Owl and Hammerhead (who are lackeys to the Kingpin) are gunned down by the Punisher despite the zombie apocalypse raging right outside.

<text>Highway 15 (BC 15), known locally as the Pacific Highway, is a north–south highway primarily located in the City of Surrey, British Columbia. The southern terminus is with Interstate 5 (I-5) near Blaine, Washington, as State Route 543 (SR 543). SR 543 is a connector between I-5 and the Canada–US border, linking with BC 15. Over 3,000 trucks per day pass through the border crossing along SR 543 and BC 15, because the Peace Arch border crossing does not allow commercial trucks.

==Route description==
SR 543 is a short highway entirely within the city of Blaine, Washington, that connects I-5 with the Canada–United States border. It begins at an interchange with I-5 with access only from the south and travels north through an industrial area with three lanes—two that run northbound and one southbound. The highway passes between Blaine High School and the former municipal airport with signalized intersections at Boblett and H streets. From here, SR 543 widens to five lanes and passes under an interchange with D Street with interior ramps providing access to a residential area and non-border areas.

As it approaches Canadian customs at the 24-hour Pacific Highway Border Crossing, the highway splits into several paths. Northbound traffic from the D Street interchange is directed into a NEXUS lane for passenger vehicles, while two lanes are used for general traffic and access to duty free stores. A set of lanes curve east and are used for buses and trucks that qualify for pre-clearance under the Free and Secure Trade program. Southbound traffic entering the United States is split into a general queue and a truck route with holding lanes. Border crossing times can become significantly delayed such as in the event of certain Seattle Mariners baseball games and summer holiday travel. During the reconstruction of the Peace Arch border crossing, delays at the Pacific Highway crossing were similar to times seen right after the attacks of September 11.

On the Canadian side of the border, the highway continues north as British Columbia Highway 15, which lies within the municipality of Surrey, British Columbia. It passes the residential neighborhood of Douglas and intersects 8 Avenue, which provides access to Highway 99 to the west. Highway 15 travels north as a divided highway through rural forestland and farmland in the Kensington Prairie, where it crosses the Nicomekl River. The highway enters the Cloverdale neighborhood and curves to the west as it crosses the Southern Railway of British Columbia and intersects Highway 10, an east–west route with connections to Newton and the city of Langley. Highway 15 travels around a commercial district and returns east to its original alignment on 176th Street as it passes Cloverdale&#x27;s casino and fairgrounds.

The highway leaves Cloverdale and intersects the Fraser Highway at a rural junction near a crossing of the Serpentine River. Highway 15 continues north to a junction with Golden Ears Way, which crosses the Fraser River to reach Pitt Meadows, and terminates at an interchange with Highway 1 (part of the Trans-Canada Highway). The interchange also marks the southern terminus of Highway 17, a divided highway that follows the southern bank of the Fraser River through industrial areas in Surrey and continues southwest towards Delta.

==History==

===British Columbia===

The Pacific Highway was opened as a gravel road on July 12, 1913, and again on August 3, 1923, as a paved road. The highway was rerouted in the mid-seventies around Cloverdale onto a bypass route which included a then new overhead. The overhead was named after a slain RCMP officer named Roger Pierlet and was opened on May 19, 1976. In 1985 and 1986 the highway was widened to four lanes from the U.S. Border to 32 Ave. From 2005 to 2008, the highway was widened to four lanes from 32 Avenue, through Cloverdale and to 92 Avenue. The project was a part of the Border Infrastructure Program, which sought to improve several highways around Metro Vancouver. 

For a time between 1942 and 1962, BC 15 was designated number 99A after the &quot;King George Highway&quot; (Hwy. 99 from 1942 to 1972, Hwy. 99A from 1973 to 2006) superseded it as the primary route to the Canada–US border. In 2009, the city of Surrey renamed &quot;King George Highway&quot; to &quot;King George Boulevard&quot;.

On December 21, 2013, the 1 billion South Fraser Perimeter Road opened as part of Highway 17, linking the northern terminus of BC 15 to Delta in the west.

===Washington===

Prior to the current Washington route numbering system, this route was designated as Primary State Highway 1 Truck Route. It ran east–west along D Street from US 99 to the Pacific Highway border crossing. A expressway to serve the border crossing and connect it with I-5 was planned in the late 1960s to relocate truck traffic from city streets. Construction of the new expressway was deferred in 1967 due to a federal cap on funds for highway projects.

The relocation of SR 543 was approved by the Blaine city government in 1970 following negotiations with the state to add traffic signals. The Great Northern Railway also proposed moving its tracks inland to the new truck route corridor, but those plans were shelved. The new truck route opened on January 20, 1972, at a cost of $640,000.

The Washington State Department of Transportation began reconstruction of SR 543 in May 2006 to expand the highway to five lanes between H Street and the border crossing. The existing truck lane was closed in October 2006 and was rebuilt to separate freight traffic from other vehicles accessing the border crossing and adjacent duty free store. The truck lane reopened in December 2007 with access to a Free and Secure Trade lane for pre-approved commercial vehicles. The roadbed of SR 543 was lowered by to accommodate an overpass carrying D Street, which opened to traffic in November 2007. A full interchange at D Street opened on February 11, 2008, marking completion of the 50.8 million project.

<doc id="664021" wikidata="Q13476036" url="?curid=664021" title="The Rocketeer (character)">
<text>The Rocketeer is a comic book superhero, created by writer/artist Dave Stevens. The character first appeared in 1982 and is an homage to the Saturday matinee serial heroes from the 1930s through the 1950s.

The Rocketeer&#x27;s secret identity is Cliff Secord, a stunt pilot who discovers a mysterious jetpack that allows him to fly. His adventures are set in pre-World War II America, and Stevens gave them a retro, nostalgic feel. Analogues of pinup diva Bettie Page and fictional pulp characters appear prominently in the series. The character first appeared in publications from Pacific Comics, and would be printed by several other independent companies until 1995. Stevens&#x27; meticulous drawing style, perfectionism and careful research gave the various Rocketeer adventures a notoriously slow publishing schedule. Following Stevens&#x27; death in 2008, his estate licensed the Rocketeer to IDW Publishing, who have since produced numerous titles starring the character.

The character was adapted into the 1991 Walt Disney Pictures film &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; by director Joe Johnston.

==Creation==
In 1981 Stevens was largely a jobbing artist, doing fill-in work on various comics as well as working in animation and design. In 1981 he was approached by Steve and Bill Schanes, brothers who had co-founded the independent Pacific Comics (and with whom he was acquainted from being a customer in their comic stores in San Diego) to produce short creator-owned back up features for Mike Grell&#x27;s &quot;Starslayer&quot;. An avowed fan of Art Deco and pre-war Americana, Stevens swiftly designed the basic idea of The Rocketeer. A major influence was Republic Pictures film serial character Commando Cody.

==Publication history==
===Pacific Comics===

The Rocketeer&#x27;s first adventures appeared in 1982 as a backup feature in issues #2 (April) and #3 (June) of &quot;Starslayer&quot;. The two short stories drew huge positive responses from readers, and the Schanes brothers wanted to commission Stevens to produce a monthly &quot;Rocketeer&quot; title. However, Stevens was reluctant to give up his other freelancing work for what he felt would be a short-lived title; he also had reservations about his abilities as a writer (a perceived short-falling Stevens would decry throughout his career). Instead, a compromise was reached whereby the character was transferred to Pacific&#x27;s new anthology showcase comic &quot;Pacific Presents&quot;, appearing in issues #1 (October 1982) and #2 (April 1983). Stevens enjoyed the work more than he had expected, and resolved to continue &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;. The Rocketeer&#x27;s success led to similar titles, including Bruce Jones&#x27; &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot; and &quot;Crash Ryan&quot;. He would recall being told that titles featuring the Rocketeer sold around 80,000 copies, a solid amount for an independent publisher of the period.

However, due to the delays between the episodes holding up publication, no further installments appeared in the following two issues of &quot;Pacific Presents&quot;, and the cliffhanger the story had ended on was not resolved before Pacific Comics folded in 1984. The concluding chapter had actually been completed and was slated for inclusion in &quot;Pacific Presents&quot; #5 when the company went out of business.

Stevens also had to deal with a lawsuit brought about by Marvel Comics, who had featured a gang of super-criminals called &#x27;The Rocketeers&#x27; in a 1975 issue of &quot;Daredevil&quot;. In a 1987 interview with Gary Groth of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;, Stevens revealed Marvel&#x27;s argument revolved entirely around trademarks, the suit claiming that the use of the name was causing confusion between the characters, something he felt was spurious. As a result Stevens refused to change the character&#x27;s name and fought against the lawsuit for three years. Some years later, a fan sent Stevens a copy of &quot;Blast-Off&quot; #1, a 1965 Harvey Comics title featuring a Jack Kirby story called &quot;The 3 Rocketeers&quot;, which he felt only underlined the absurdity of Marvel&#x27;s legal action. Stevens also felt Marvel&#x27;s actions were influenced by his decision to turn down an offer to take the series to Epic Comics following Pacific&#x27;s demise. He would credit Disney coming onboard for the film adaptation of &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; with ending Marvel&#x27;s pursuit. In 2016, Brian Cronin used his &#x27;Comic Book Legends&#x27; column for Comic Book Resources to openly ridicule Marvel&#x27;s actions.

===Eclipse Comics===
Like many of the creator-owned titles left without a publisher by Pacific&#x27;s collapse, Stevens made a deal with California-based publisher Eclipse Comics to complete the storyline. The result was the one-shot &quot;Rocketeer Special Edition&quot; in November 1984, which concluded the story arc. The comic also included 8 pages of pin-ups by different artists, a sign of Stevens&#x27; growing status within the comics industry. The contributors included Gray Morrow, Doug Wildey, Murphy Anderson, and Al Williamson and an introduction by Mark Evanier. The issue was a sales success for Eclipse, and was the 51st bestselling title from a range of stores polled by &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, the second-highest position on the chart for a non-Marvel/DC comic.

Following the publication of this &quot;Special Edition&quot;, Stevens worked with Eclipse to produce a trade paperback collecting the material produced so far. Stevens revised several pages for the compilation and recolored the story by hand, which was also relettered by Carrie Spiegle. Stevens created additional pages to address what he felt was poor storytelling in the serialized episodes, and was assisted in this endeavor by Jaime Hernandez (who would be credited as &#x27;Hurricane Hernandez&#x27;). The album features an introduction from fantasist Harlan Ellison, a fan of the series who had also attempted to intercede in Stevens&#x27; dispute with Marvel Comics. The collected edition won &quot;Best Graphic Album&quot; at the 1986 Kirby Awards, beating volumes of &quot;Love and Rockets&quot; and &quot;Nexus&quot;.

The collection would go on to become Eclipse&#x27;s best-selling graphic novel, going through three printings. Eclipse&#x27;s treatment of the series, which used high-quality over-sized pages printed using Baxter paper stock (, compared to the standard comic book size of ), led to Stevens signing a deal that would see the company print future collected editions, though none were completed before Eclipse folded in 1994. Eclipse also licensed the material for overseas publication, without Stevens&#x27; permission - and without paying him.

===Comico===
While Stevens was pleased with the collected edition, he did not enjoy working for Eclipse and searched for a new publisher to produce a sequel story, which he initially envisioned as a six-issue limited series. In August 1986 a deal was announced with , which would see Elaine Lee and Michael Kaluta&#x27;s &quot;Galactic Girl Guides&quot; (continued from the Epic Comics title &quot;Starstruck&quot;) as a back-up, as well as non-fiction articles on aviation pioneers. The new material was planned as two three-issue mini-series, allowing Stevens the time required to create the material, and would run under the title &quot;The Rocketeer Adventure Magazine&quot;. Stevens chose Comico after being impressed by their production values and willingness to allow flexible deadlines. Comico administrative director Bob Schreck was however forced to clarify that, despite the title, &quot;The Rocketeer Adventure Magazine&quot; was a comic and not a magazine, noting the name had been chosen by Stevens as a homage to pulp magazines.

Despite being planned for the summer of 1987, the first issue of the title did not appear until July 1988 due to Stevens&#x27; detailed approach and the concluding stages of the Marvel lawsuit. Due to the relative lack of money in independent comics at the time, he was also forced to frequently pause the series to produce covers for other series and other freelance assignments. In discussion with Heidi MacDonald of &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, Stevens defended the series&#x27; schedule, noting that while he was more than capable of producing a page a day the result &quot;would look like anyone did it.&quot; It met with positive reviews and was nominated for &#x27;Best Story or Single Issue&#x27; at the second annual Harvey Awards, but lost out to &quot;&quot;. Paul De Meo and Danny Bilson, who were working on the screenplay for the film version, would contribute to the writing of the storyline.

Only one more issue - in July 1989, and further delayed when Stevens suffered a car accident - appeared before Comico declared bankruptcy in 1990.

===Film adaptation===

Stevens had been quick to realize the potential of &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, and had first sold film rights to the character in 1983. The project would finally make it to screen in 1991 under Walt Disney Pictures. Production was beset by shifting creative teams and Disney&#x27;s desire to turn the property into a marketable family franchise, and Stevens would later consider the film to be &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; &quot;in name only&quot;. One of the most significant changes was the replacement of Betty with an actress character called Jenny, played by Jennifer Connelly; Paul De Meo recalled this was partly informed by Disney wanting to make the film more family friendly, and partly due to not wanting to pay money to Bettie Page for the use of her name.

As part of the promotional onslaught, an official adaptation of the film was made and published as a one-shot by Disney&#x27;s comic label Hollywood Comics. This was adapted from the script by Peter David, and featured interior artwork by Russ Heath, who was hand-picked by Stevens. Stevens himself provided the cover for the title, while a 3-D comic with a storyline by Ron Kidd was also produced. T.K. Dean awarded &quot;The Rocketeer: The Official Movie Adaptation&quot; four stars out of five in a review for &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot;, praising the pace and David&#x27;s dialogue.

Despite broadly positive critical response, the film under-performed financially and plans to make sequels were scrapped.
===Dark Horse Comics===
After Comico&#x27;s financial troubles, Stevens signed with Dark Horse Comics to publish the third issue of the series. The deal was announced in June 1991; however, it would not be until 1995 that the third and final issue of &quot;The Rocketeer Adventure Magazine&quot;, featuring the conclusion of &quot;Cliff&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot;, finally appeared. This was partly due to Comico having (incorrectly) listed the Rocketeer as one of their assets in bankruptcy proceedings. Another setback came in January 1994 when an earthquake struck California, bursting water pipes in Stevens&#x27; studio and destroying several completed pages.

Following the conclusion, Stevens lost interest in publishing new &quot;Rocketeer&quot; material. He grew tired of switching publishers, while finding new avenues for his approach dwindling after the collapse of the direct market after the early 1990s speculator boom period. Dark Horse also had reservations about the comic&#x27;s high production values allowing the book to be profitable, though the company did produce a collected Rocketeer edition compiling all three issues of the &quot;Cliff&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot; storyline. Stevens would later pitch a crossover Rocketeer miniseries to DC Comics featuring the Golden Age Superman meeting Cliff in 1938. However, he disliked DC&#x27;s proposed revisions to the storyline, so he abandoned the idea.

===IDW Publishing===
In 2008, Stevens struck a deal with IDW Publishing to produce a collected edition of his &quot;Rocketeer&quot; work. On February 28, 2009, IDW announced a hardcover collecting the entire series, intended to be published in October 2009. &quot;Dave Stevens&#x27; The Rocketeer: The Complete Adventures&quot; contained new coloring by Laura Martin, who had been chosen by Dave Stevens prior to his death.

==Synopsis==
In April 1938, Cliff Secord is a small-time pilot at Bigelow&#x27;s Air Circus, based at the Chaplin Aerodrome near Los Angeles. He discovers a rocket pack hidden by two gangsters fleeing the police in his custom racing plane, the Blind Bulldog. He takes the device to his friend, the avuncular engineer Peevy, who is fascinated by the device and designs a helmet to allow Cliff to direct the rocket pack, which they plan to test. However, their efforts cause Secord to miss his slot for a barnstorming act at the aerodrome. To cover for him one of Cliff&#x27;s fellow pilots, the alcoholic Malcolm, takes the plane up but soon has problems. Cliff retrieves the helmet and rocket pack and, after some difficulty, rescues Malcolm before the plane crashes. The dramatic rescue attracts press attention, and while Cliff is able to land without being identified by the crowd, he is captured by a gun-toting heavy. The press name the mysterious hero &quot;the Rocketeer&quot;, while Peevy and Cliff&#x27;s girl Betty search for him. Cliff and his captor are run off the road; he discovers the dead driver was a G-man, and their attackers are Nazi agents hoping to capture the rocket pack for the Fatherland. He is able to escape and is patched up by Betty and Peevy. Aghast at the danger, Betty makes Cliff promise to return the rocket pack to its rightful owner. However, the following day, Bigelow fires Cliff, and Betty is kidnapped by Nazi thugs. Cliff gives chase in the Bulldog, and is able to harry them into crashing; Betty is saved, but the hoods escape and identify Secord as having the rocket pack. Without a job and with Betty spending more time trying to launch her modelling career with photographer Marco of Hollywood, Cliff becomes downcast until Peevy shows talks him through the instructions for the rocket engine, which Secord hadn&#x27;t bothered reading, leading to a more successful test. After returning home, he finds two colorful characters waiting for him, representatives of the inventor of the device. Cliff gives them the slip and Peevy is able to smuggle him to the aerodrome. However, when they arrive they find the new experimental Douglas Locust plane has been hijacked; Cliff attempts to clear his name by recovering the Locust, evading the rocket&#x27;s inventor in the process. The latter gives chase in a Boeing P-26, saving Secord when the pack runs out of fuel. The pair then work together, with the inventor dropping Cliff onto the aircraft. He overpowers the Nazi pilots and is able to successfully crash-land the Locust. Cliff is hospitalized; on returning to consciousness he finds that Betty has gone to New York City with Marcus, who plans to launch her as a model in Europe. Determined to follow her, he recovers the rocket pack and fakes his own death before setting out in the Blind Bulldog to win Betty back.

Marco shows off Betty to his rich New York friends, but she is shaken when she hears of Cliff&#x27;s apparent death. Cliff, meanwhile, lands in Long Island, meeting his old friend Goose Gander, and begins to search the city&#x27;s nightclubs for Betty. He is successful but ends up in argument with her after she refuses to return to California, leading to a scuffle with Marcus. The latter has Cliff restrained and beaten until he is interrupted by a mysterious figure who identifies himself as Jonas. A bitter Cliff refuses Betty&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation and sulks, unaware that she has decided against sailing to Europe with Marcus and is instead heading back to Los Angeles. Instead, through Goose he is engaged by Jonas to help break up the activities of a criminal gang in Bowery. The operation pulls him into a murder investigation being carried out by Jonas; the victims are all former circus Secord colleagues. Only two members are unaccounted for, the magician Orsino and the gigantic, monstrous strongman, Lothar. Cliff and Goose are able to save Orsino from Lothar, who is killing the troupe in revenge for the accidental death of midget Teena, with whom he had become obsessed. Lothar tries to kill Cliff and Orsini at a funfair on the Boardwalk, but, with help from Jonas, Secord is able to once again don his Rocketeer outfit and save his friend. Lothar is killed in the process, after which Cliff returns to LA, where Betty is waiting for him at the Bulldog Cafe.

==Characters==
*Cliff Secord/The Rocketeer: A headstrong but broadly good-hearted aviator who discovers the rocket pack and embarks on a chaotic career as masked crimefighter the Rocketeer. Cliff was modelled on Stevens himself, partly due to the artist being unable to find a suitable subject. Stevens described the character as flawed, and noted his primary motivation was self-interest rather than altruism.
*Betty: Cliff&#x27;s girlfriend, and an aspiring celebrity working as a girlie magazine model. Stevens described the character as being in love with Cliff but also ambitious. The character was visually based on 1950s magazine model Bettie Page, of whom Stevens was an avid fan. Several frames of the character are inspired by specific pictorials of Page, including some from Irving Klaw&#x27;s bondage magazines. He would also draw a fictionalised version of Page for the 1996 Dark Horse Comics one-shot &quot;Bettie Page Comics&quot;, and eventually become friends with Page, helping make her aware of the commercial value of her image. Stevens&#x27; friend William Stout felt Cliff and Betty&#x27;s tempestuous romance was heavily influenced by the artist&#x27;s own relationship with model Brinke Stevens. 
*Ambrose &quot;Peevy&quot; Peabody: A curmudgeonly aviation engineer and mechanic who helps Cliff at the aerodrome. Despite his reservations over Cliff&#x27;s frequent acts of idiocy and his general bad-tempered dislike of anyone apart from Betty, he helps the hero out by creating the Rocketeer helmet and actually reading the directions for operation of the rocket pack, a step neglected by Cliff himself. Both Peevy&#x27;s appearance and personality were modelled on artist Doug Wildey, an acquaintance of Stevens.
*Marcus of Hollywood: A sleazy glamor photographer who plans to make a fortune by exploiting Betty&#x27;s looks, figure and willingness to do nearly anything for stardom. His career in exploitation has earned him the enmity of Jonas, who also implies that the pornographer&#x27;s real name is Markovitch. He was reputedly modelled on Ken Marcus.
*The inventor: An ace pilot who created the rocket pack. While irritated by the complications Secord&#x27;s actions cause to his attempts to recover the invention, he is broadly sympathetic and supportive to the young aviator and quickly realises he is no traitor. Peevy incorrectly guesses his real identity to be Howard Hughes (who was adapted as the pack&#x27;s creator in the film adaptation). The character was based on pulp magazine hero Doc Savage, but to avoid possible legal action the character was unnamed and only seen wearing a flying helmet.
*Colonel May and &quot;Fancy-Pants&quot;: The inventor&#x27;s private investigators and general enforcers. May is a fast-tempered, almost simian but good-hearted thug; his unnamed colleague is a prim, proper and well-dressed gentleman. Peevy misidentifies them as Hughes&#x27; bodyguards Colonel Mayberg and Noah Dietrich, much to May&#x27;s amusement. In further reference to Doc Savage, Stevens modelled them on the Man of Bronze&#x27;s assistants Ham Brooks and Monk Mayfair.
*&quot;Goose&quot; Gander: A New York-based pilot and childhood friend of Cliff&#x27;s, Gander is an inveterate joker and a talented autogyro flier.
*Jonas: A mysterious high society gentleman who wages a private war on crime and sleaze in New York City. Stevens modelled the character on pulp hero The Shadow, who at the time had recently been revived by DC Comics.
*Lothar: A gigantic former circus colleague of Secord&#x27;s. Lothar harboured a crush on troupe midget Teena, who was in turn in love with Cliff and drowned covering for his dalliance with an acrobat. In the decade since Lothar has murdered most of the other members of the troupe, using his inhuman strength to bend them in half. The character&#x27;s craggy features were modelled on actor Rondo Hatton.
*Millie: The proprietor of the Bulldog Cafe, a dog-shaped café and diner frequented by the Chaplin Aerodrome pilots, and occasional sympathetic ear to Cliff&#x27;s self-inflicted woes.

==Collected editions==
==Licensed titles==
Following Stevens&#x27; death, IDW began publishing additional Rocketeer comics by a variety of creators. The first was anthology limited series &quot;The Rocketeer Adventurers&quot; in 2011, featuring story contributions from creators Mike Allred, John Arcudi, Kurt Busiek, John Cassaday, Darwyn Cooke, Tommy Lee Edwards, Lowell Francis, Dave Gibbons, Gene Ha, Scott Hampton, Mike Kaluta, Joe R. Lansdale, Brendan McCarthy, Ryan Sook, Bruce Timm, Mark Waid and Chris Weston, as well as Jonathan Ross. A second four-issue mini series appeared the following year, featuring work from 
Kyle Baker, John Byrne, David Lapham, Sandy Plunkett, Stan Sakai, Bill Sienkiewicz, John K. Snyder III and Chris Sprouse.

In 2013, IDW published two further mini-series - &quot;The Rocketeer: Cargo of Doom&quot; by Waid and Chris Samnee, and &quot;The Rocketeer: Hollywood Horror&quot; by Roger Langridge and J. Bone. 2014 saw Waid and Paul Smith create a cross over with The Spirit, &quot;The Rocketeer &amp; the Spirit: Pulp Friction&quot;, while IDW also published prose anthology &quot;The Rocketeer: Jet-Pack Adventures&quot;, which included short stories by authors such as Yvonne Navarro, Don Webb, Gregory Frost, Nancy Holder, Nancy A. Collins and others.

IDW planned to reboot the series with a new female lead in the 2018 series &quot;The Rocketeer Reborn&quot;, but the title was cancelled before any of the material saw print. In January 2023, it was reported that IDW Publishing would publish a one-shot anthology based on an unfinished story by Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo, who wrote the screenplay for the 1991 film.

==Reception and legacy==
As early as 1985, &quot;Amazing Heroes&quot; described the series as critically acclaimed. In the same magazine, N.A. Collins praised the character&#x27;s design, calling the costume &quot;evocative of Doc Savage, Captain Future and Buck Rogers just with one glance&quot;. IGN listed the Rocketeer as the 76th Greatest Comic Book Character, stating that the Rocketeer taps into that popular desire to fly. IGN also stated the Rocketeer saga remains a compelling one.

In 1994, Stevens met Bettie Page and showed her &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;; he recalled she found it &quot;funny and cute&quot;. The series has been widely credited as a factor in the revival of interest in Page. Comic artist Adam Hughes credited &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; as igniting his interest in comics. The character has also been identified as an example of steampunk, dieselpunk, and retrofuturism.

<text>Network switching subsystem (NSS) (or GSM core network) is the component of a GSM system that carries out call out and mobility management functions for mobile phones roaming on the network of base stations. It is owned and deployed by mobile phone operators and allows mobile devices to communicate with each other and telephones in the wider public switched telephone network (PSTN). The architecture contains specific features and functions which are needed because the phones are not fixed in one location.

The NSS originally consisted of the circuit-switched core network, used for traditional GSM services such as voice calls, SMS, and circuit switched data calls. It was extended with an overlay architecture to provide packet-switched data services known as the GPRS core network. This allows mobile phones to have access to services such as WAP, MMS and the Internet.

==Mobile switching center (MSC)==
===Description===
The mobile switching center (MSC) is the primary service delivery node for GSM/CDMA, responsible for routing voice calls and SMS as well as other services (such as conference calls, FAX, and circuit-switched data).

The MSC sets up and releases the end-to-end connection, handles mobility and hand-over requirements during the call and takes care of charging and real-time prepaid account monitoring.

In the GSM mobile phone system, in contrast with earlier analogue services, fax and data information is sent digitally encoded directly to the MSC. Only at the MSC is this re-coded into an &quot;analogue&quot; signal (although actually this will almost certainly mean sound is encoded digitally as a pulse-code modulation (PCM) signal in a 64-kbit/s timeslot, known as a DS0 in America).

There are various different names for MSCs in different contexts which reflects their complex role in the network, all of these terms though could refer to the same MSC, but doing different things at different times.

The gateway MSC (G-MSC) is the MSC that determines which &quot;visited MSC&quot; (V-MSC) the subscriber who is being called is currently located at. It also interfaces with the PSTN. All mobile to mobile calls and PSTN to mobile calls are routed through a G-MSC. The term is only valid in the context of one call, since any MSC may provide both the gateway function and the visited MSC function. However, some manufacturers design dedicated high capacity MSCs which do not have any base station subsystems (BSS) connected to them. These MSCs will then be the gateway MSC for many of the calls they handle.

The visited MSC (V-MSC) is the MSC where a customer is currently located. The visitor location register (VLR) associated with this MSC will have the subscriber&#x27;s data in it.

The anchor MSC is the MSC from which a handover has been initiated. The target MSC is the MSC toward which a handover should take place. A mobile switching center server is a part of the redesigned MSC concept starting from 3GPP Release 4.

===Mobile switching center server (MSC-Server, MSCS or MSS)===
The mobile switching center server is a soft-switch variant (therefore it may be referred to as mobile soft switch, MSS) of the mobile switching center, which provides circuit-switched calling mobility management, and GSM services to the mobile phones roaming within the area that it serves. The functionality enables split control between (signaling ) and user plane (bearer in network element called as media gateway/MG), which guarantees better placement of network elements within the network.

MSS and media gateway (MGW) makes it possible to cross-connect circuit-switched calls switched by using IP, ATM AAL2 as well as TDM. More information is available in 3GPP TS 23.205.

The term Circuit switching (CS) used here originates from traditional telecommunications systems. However, modern MSS and MGW devices mostly use generic Internet technologies and form next-generation telecommunication networks. MSS software may run on generic computers or virtual machines in cloud environment.

===Other GSM core network elements connected to the MSC===
The MSC connects to the following elements:
* The home location register (HLR) for obtaining data about the SIM and mobile services ISDN number (MSISDN; i.e., the telephone number).
* The base station subsystems (BSS) which handles the radio communication with 2G and 2.5G mobile phones.
* The UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) which handles the radio communication with 3G mobile phones.
* The visitor location register (VLR) provides subscriber information when the subscriber is outside its home network.
* Other MSCs for procedures such as hand over.

===Procedures implemented===
Tasks of the MSC include:
* Delivering calls to subscribers as they arrive based on information from the VLR.
* Connecting outgoing calls to other mobile subscribers or the PSTN.
* Delivering SMSs from subscribers to the short message service center (SMSC) and vice versa.
* Arranging handovers from BSC to BSC.
* Carrying out handovers from this MSC to another.
* Supporting supplementary services such as conference calls or call hold.
* Generating billing information.

==Home location register (HLR) ==
The home location register (HLR) is a central database that contains details of each mobile phone subscriber that is authorized to use the GSM core network. There can be several logical, and physical, HLRs per public land mobile network (PLMN), though one international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)/MSISDN pair can be associated with only one logical HLR (which can span several physical nodes) at a time.

The HLRs store details of every SIM card issued by the mobile phone operator. Each SIM has a unique identifier called an IMSI which is the primary key to each HLR record.

Another important item of data associated with the SIM are the MSISDNs, which are the telephone numbers used by mobile phones to make and receive calls. The primary MSISDN is the number used for making and receiving voice calls and SMS, but it is possible for a SIM to have other secondary MSISDNs associated with it for fax and data calls. Each MSISDN is also a unique key to the HLR record. The HLR data is stored for as long as a subscriber remains with the mobile phone operator.

Examples of other data stored in the HLR against an IMSI record is:
* GSM services that the subscriber has requested or been given.
* General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) settings to allow the subscriber to access packet services.
* Current location of subscriber (VLR and serving GPRS support node/SGSN).
* Call divert settings applicable for each associated MSISDN.

The HLR is a system which directly receives and processes MAP transactions and messages from elements in the GSM network, for example, the location update messages received as mobile phones roam around.

===Other GSM core network elements connected to the HLR===
The HLR connects to the following elements:
* The G-MSC for handling incoming calls
* The VLR for handling requests from mobile phones to attach to the network
* The SMSC for handling incoming SMSs
* The voice mail system for delivering notifications to the mobile phone that a message is waiting
* The AuC for authentication and ciphering and exchange of data (triplets)

===Procedures implemented===
The main function of the HLR is to manage the fact that SIMs and phones move around a lot. The following procedures are implemented to deal with this:
* Manage the mobility of subscribers by means of updating their position in administrative areas called &#x27;location areas&#x27;, which are identified with a LAC. The action of a user of moving from one LA to another is followed by the HLR with a Location area update procedure.
* Send the subscriber data to a VLR or SGSN when a subscriber first roams there.
* Broker between the G-MSC or SMSC and the subscriber&#x27;s current VLR in order to allow incoming calls or text messages to be delivered.
* Remove subscriber data from the previous VLR when a subscriber has roamed away from it.
* Responsible for all SRI related queries (i.e. for invoke SRI, HLR should give sack SRI or SRI reply).

== Authentication center (AuC)==

===Description===
The authentication center (AuC) is a function to authenticate each SIM card that attempts to connect to the gsm core network (typically when the phone is powered on). Once the authentication is successful, the HLR is allowed to manage the SIM and services described above. An encryption key is also generated that is subsequently used to encrypt all wireless communications (voice, SMS, etc.) between the mobile phone and the GSM core network.

If the authentication fails, then no services are possible from that particular combination of SIM card and mobile phone operator attempted. There is an additional form of identification check performed on the serial number of the mobile phone described in the EIR section below, but this is not relevant to the AuC processing.

Proper implementation of security in and around the AuC is a key part of an operator&#x27;s strategy to avoid SIM cloning.

The AuC does not engage directly in the authentication process, but instead generates data known as &quot;triplets&quot; for the MSC to use during the procedure. The security of the process depends upon a shared secret between the AuC and the SIM called the &quot;Ki&quot;. The &quot;Ki&quot; is securely burned into the SIM during manufacture and is also securely replicated onto the AuC. This &quot;Ki&quot; is never transmitted between the AuC and SIM, but is combined with the IMSI to produce a challenge/response for identification purposes and an encryption key called &quot;Kc&quot; for use in over the air communications.

===Other GSM core network elements connected to the AuC===
The AuC connects to the following elements:
* The MSC which requests a new batch of triplet data for an IMSI after the previous data have been used. This ensures that same keys and challenge responses are not used twice for a particular mobile.

===Procedures implemented===
The AuC stores the following data for each IMSI:
* the &quot;Ki&quot;
* Algorithm id. (the standard algorithms are called A3 or A8, but an operator may choose a proprietary one).

When the MSC asks the AuC for a new set of triplets for a particular IMSI, the AuC first generates a random number known as &quot;RAND&quot;. This &quot;RAND&quot; is then combined with the &quot;Ki&quot; to produce two numbers as follows:
* The &quot;Ki&quot; and &quot;RAND&quot; are fed into the A3 algorithm and the signed response (SRES) is calculated.
* The &quot;Ki&quot; and &quot;RAND&quot; are fed into the A8 algorithm and a session key called &quot;Kc&quot; is calculated.
The numbers (&quot;RAND&quot;, SRES, &quot;Kc&quot;) form the triplet sent back to the MSC. When a particular IMSI requests access to the GSM core network, the MSC sends the &quot;RAND&quot; part of the triplet to the SIM. The SIM then feeds this number and the &quot;Ki&quot; (which is burned onto the SIM) into the A3 algorithm as appropriate and an SRES is calculated and sent back to the MSC. If this SRES matches with the SRES in the triplet (which it should if it is a valid SIM), then the mobile is allowed to attach and proceed with GSM services.

After successful authentication, the MSC sends the encryption key &quot;Kc&quot; to the base station controller (BSC) so that all communications can be encrypted and decrypted. Of course, the mobile phone can generate the &quot;Kc&quot; itself by feeding the same RAND supplied during authentication and the &quot;Ki&quot; into the A8 algorithm.

The AuC is usually collocated with the HLR, although this is not necessary. Whilst the procedure is secure for most everyday use, it is by no means hack proof. Therefore, a new set of security methods was designed for 3G phones.

In practice, A3 and A8 algorithms are generally implemented together (known as A3/A8, see COMP128). An A3/A8 algorithm is implemented in Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards and in GSM network Authentication Centers. It is used to authenticate the customer and generate a key for encrypting voice and data traffic, as defined in 3GPP TS 43.020 (03.20 before Rel-4). Development of A3 and A8 algorithms is considered a matter for individual GSM network operators, although example implementations are available. To encrypt Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cellular communications A5 algorithm is used. 

==Visitor location register (VLR)==

===Description===
The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database of the MSs (Mobile stations) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) which it serves. Each main base transceiver station in the network is served by exactly one VLR (one BTS may be served by many MSCs in case of MSC in pool), hence a subscriber cannot be present in more than one VLR at a time.

The data stored in the VLR has either been received from the Home Location Register (HLR), or collected from the MS. In practice, for performance reasons, most vendors integrate the VLR directly to the V-MSC and, where this is not done, the VLR is very tightly linked with the MSC via a proprietary interface. Whenever an MSC detects a new MS in its network, in addition to creating a new record in the VLR, it also updates the HLR of the mobile subscriber, apprising it of the new location of that MS. If VLR data is corrupted it can lead to serious issues with text messaging and call services.

Data stored include: 
* IMSI (the subscriber&#x27;s identity number).
* Authentication data.
* MSISDN (the subscriber&#x27;s phone number).
* GSM services that the subscriber is allowed to access.
* access point (GPRS) subscribed.
* The HLR address of the subscriber.
* SCP Address(For Prepaid Subscriber).

===Procedures implemented===
The primary functions of the VLR are:
* To inform the HLR that a subscriber has arrived in the particular area covered by the VLR.
* To track where the subscriber is within the VLR area (location area) when no call is ongoing.
* To allow or disallow which services the subscriber may use.
* To allocate roaming numbers during the processing of incoming calls.
* To purge the subscriber record if a subscriber becomes inactive whilst in the area of a VLR. The VLR deletes the subscriber&#x27;s data after a fixed time period of inactivity and informs the HLR (e.g., when the phone has been switched off and left off or when the subscriber has moved to an area with no coverage for a long time).
* To delete the subscriber record when a subscriber explicitly moves to another, as instructed by the HLR.

==Equipment identity register (EIR)==
EIR is a system that handles real-time requests to check the IMEI (checkIMEI) of mobile devices that come from the switching equipment (MSC, SGSN, MME). The answer contains the result of the check:

* whitelisted – the device is allowed to register on the network.
* blacklisted – the device is prohibited from registering on the network.
* greylisted – the device is allowed to register on the network temporarily.
* An error ‘unknown equipment’ may also be returned.

The switching equipment must use the EIR response to determine whether or not to allow the device to register or re-register on the network. Since the response of switching equipment to ‘greylisted’ and ‘unknown equipment’ responses is not clearly described in the standard, they are most often not used.

Most often, EIR uses the IMEI blacklist feature, which contains the IMEI of the devices that need to be banned from the network. As a rule, these are stolen or lost devices. Mobile operators rarely use EIR capabilities to block devices on their own. Usually blocking begins when there is a law in the country, which obliges all cellular operators of the country to do so. Therefore, in the delivery of the basic components of the network switching subsystem (core network) is often already present EIR with basic functionality, which includes a ‘whitelisted’ response to all CheckIMEI and the ability to fill IMEI blacklist, which will be given a ‘blacklisted’ response. 

When the legislative framework for blocking registration of devices in cellular networks appears in the country, the telecommunications regulator usually has a Central EIR (CEIR) system, which is integrated with the EIR of all operators and transmits to them the actual lists of identifiers that must be used when processing CheckIMEI requests. In doing so, there may be many new requirements for EIR systems that are not present in the legacy EIR:

* Synchronizing lists with CEIR. CEIR systems are not described by a standard, so the protocols and exchange mode may differ from country to country.
* Supporting additional lists – IMEI white list, IMEI grey list, list of allocated TACs, etc.
* Support in lists not only IMEI but also bindings – IMEI-IMSI, IMEI-MSISDN, IMEI-IMSI-MSISDN.
* Supporting the customized logic of lists applying. 
* Automatic adding the item to a list in separate scenarios.
* Sending SMS notifications to subscribers in separate scenarios.
* Integration with the billing system to receive IMSI-MSISDN bundles.
* Accumulating the subscribers’ profiles (history of device changing).
* Long-term storage of processing of all CheckIMEI requests.

Other functions may be required in individual cases. For example, Kazakhstan has introduced mandatory registration of devices and their binding to subscribers. But when a subscriber appears in the network with a new device, the network operation is not blocked completely, and the subscriber is allowed to register the device. To do this, there are blocked all services, except the following: calls to a specific service number, sending SMS to a specific service number, and all Internet traffic is redirected to a specific landing page. This is achieved by the fact that EIR can send commands to several MNO systems (HLR, PCRF, SMSC, etc.).

The most common suppliers of individual EIR systems (not as part of a complex solution) are the companies BroadForward, Mahindra Comviva, Mavenir, Nokia, Eastwind.

==Other support functions==
Connected more or less directly to the GSM core network are many other functions.

===Billing center (BC)===
The billing center is responsible for processing the toll tickets generated by the VLRs and HLRs and generating a bill for each subscriber. It is also responsible for generating billing data of roaming subscriber.

===Multimedia messaging service center (MMSC)===
The multimedia messaging service center supports the sending of multimedia messages (e.g., images, audio, video and their combinations) to (or from) MMS-bluetooth.

===Voicemail system (VMS)===
The voicemail system records and stores voicemail.

===Lawful interception functions===

According to U.S. law, which has also been copied into many other countries, especially in Europe, all telecommunications equipment must provide facilities for monitoring the calls of selected users. There must be some level of support for this built into any of the different elements. The concept of &quot;lawful interception&quot; is also known, following the relevant U.S. law, as CALEA.
Generally, lawful Interception implementation is similar to the implementation of conference call. While A and B are talking with each other, C can join the call and listen silently.

<text>Pickford&#x27;s House Museum of Georgian Life and Costume is in Derby, England. It is named after architect Joseph Pickford, who built it as his family home in 1770. It was opened as a museum in 1988. The building is Grade I listed.

==History==
Pickford&#x27;s House, at No 41 Friar Gate Derby,
is an elegant Georgian town house built by the prominent architect Joseph Pickford in 1770 for his own family. 

When Pickford died he left the house to Reverend Joseph Pickford who had the house extended and divided into two properties.. He left the house to his cousin William Pickford in his will in 1844. William promptly mortgaged the house and by 1850 it was sold to William Evans (1788–1856) of Allestree Hall. His son Sir Thomas William Evans 1st Bt, who was also a politician, sold it in 1879 to Frederick Ward who sold it to William Curgenven, the first of a number of surgeons to own it. In 1977 it was upgraded from Grade II to Grade I. It was purchased in 1982 by Derby City Council. The council did not pay enough attention to its Grade I status and they removed chimneys, floors and walls without applying for permission. 

Pickford&#x27;s House has been run by Derby Museums Trust since October 2012.

==The Museum==

The museum that was established in 1988 shows the accommodation of a late Georgian professional person. The ground floor is furnished as it might have been in Pickford&#x27;s time together with displays of eighteenth and nineteenth century costume.

&quot;Pickford&#x27;s House&quot; was intended to showcase his work, with the intention of securing new contacts. It was also his residence. Unlike many houses open to the public this was not owned by a member of the aristocracy but by a professional. The relative luxury of the Pickford family bedroom and dressing room which are decorated as they would have been in 1815 can be compared with the servants&#x27; bedrooms above. The house also has kitchens, scullery and laundry that are kept as they might have been in 1830. At the rear of the property Pickford had his builder&#x27;s yard, access being by a driveway to the right of the property. The cellar of the property is decorated as a 1940s bomb shelter. The museum is also home to a collection of model toy theatres that were gathered by Frank Bradley.

<text>or is the supernatural undersea palace of Ryūjin or Dragon God in Japanese tradition.

It is best known as the place in fairytale where Urashima Tarō was invited after saving a turtle, where he was entertained by the Dragon God&#x27;s princess Oto-hime and his minions, but when Urashima returned back to land after what he thought was a few days away, centuries had passed.

== Overview ==
Ryūgū or Ryūgū-jō is the fabulous mythical residence of the Ryūjin (Dragon God) or Sea God, or the princess Otohime. It is also equated with the &quot;fish-scale palace&quot; () which was the Sea God Watatsumi&#x27;s palace mentioned in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (8th century).

The Ryūgū is well-known as the supernatural place in the fisherman&#x27;s fairytale Urashima Tarō, and most Japanese now consider it to be a place which is supposed to lie under the sea. Actually, Ryūgū that appears in other narratives and fairytales () had been considered to be underwater for a long time, but in the particular case of the Urashima legend, its Dragon Palace was not firmly considered to be underwater until quite late in the modern period.

== Urashima ==
=== Afloat or undersea ===
In most familiar versions of the &quot;Urashima&quot; legend nowadays in Japan, the Ryūgū lies undersea, but in early and &quot;otogizoshi versions&quot;, the fisherman traveled to Hōrai (Mount Penglai, the Elysium in Chinese tradition), a floating island. During the Edo era, pictorial depiction of Ryūgū above the waves remained fairly conventional. A work may illustrate Ryūgū above water, yet describe it textually as underwater, as in a burlesque &quot;gesaku&quot; work of 1782.

In the Meiji era, or &quot;redbook picture books&quot; of the 1880s, as well as Tsukioka Yoshitoshi&#x27;s (1886) print are examples of Ryūgū illustrated above water, but they are lacking in textual detail on whether it is a sunken city or not. The &quot;akahon&quot; illustrations were appropriated by Masayuki Kataoka&#x27;s English translation (1886), which describes the Dragon Palace as visible &quot;far below&quot; the water, to which the man carried by the reptile &quot;descended&quot;.

Ryūgū was described as a &quot;Dragon Palace beyond the blue sea&quot;, in Basil Hall Chamberlain&#x27;s translation (1886). Here the &quot;Dragon Palace&quot; is illustrated as a complex of buildings atop an island, with fishes clad in kimono walking about the sandy shore. Chamberlain had freely substituted more ancient text material into his retelling of the &quot;Urashima&quot; fairytale. Chamberlain also interchangeably uses &quot;Sea God&#x27;s Palace&quot;, probably with the archaic god-name Watatsumi in mind.

Eventually, the Dragon Palace undersea became the standard in modern tellings of the Urashima tale. A canonical example by the Taisho Era, according to one researcher, was the edition by Mori Rintarō (novelist Mori Ōgai) and others, published 1920–1921, whose illustration shows Urashima and the turtle peeing underneath at the palace.

=== Palace architecture ===
&quot;The walls of the Palace were of coral, the trees had emeralds for leaves and rubies for berries&quot; (Chamberlain), roughly coincides with the inner chambers being fashioned with according to Meiji Era &quot;akahon ehon&quot; (&quot;red book&quot; editions).

The use of materials such as pearl or crystal on the exterior is given in Brauns&#x27; translation (Englished by Lang), alongside the interior hall being illuminated by fish scales.

Masayuki Kataoka&#x27;s English translation (1886) describes a Dragon&#x27;s Palace with a crystal dome, which a researcher considers a novel, unfamiliar feature. Kataoka&#x27;s translation, upon comparison, differed greatly from the text of the &quot;akahon&quot; picture books, though he had blatantly appropriated and reworked their illustrations. Here, there is a long distance from the gatekeeper to the palace proper, and Urashima is guided by a pretty glass ball that rolls of is own accord.

=== Four seasons on four sides ===
A notable feature of the Dragon Palace according to the &quot;feudal&quot; (&quot;otogizōshi&quot;) versions is the view to the &quot;four seasons on four sides&quot;, though this has been eschewed in Chamberlain&#x27;s translation.

However, the view to the four seasons is incorporated in Mrs. Ozaki&#x27;s translation: cherry blossom in bloom to the east (spring), buzzing cicadas to the south (summer), multi-colored maple leaves to the west (autumn), and snow-covered ground to the north (winter). This is presumably based on a text edited by , probably the text of &quot;Nihon mukashibanashi&quot; (1896), which corresponds roughly with a version from the &quot;Otogizōshi&quot;. The four seasons also figure in F. Hadland Davis&#x27;s synopsis (1912). The usual bird which sings in spring is the bush warbler, not actually a nightingale. More precise translations from the &quot;otogizōshi&quot; text are given elsewhere.
=== Passage of time ===
Whether in the ancient (Nara Period), feudal period or standard modern versions of &quot;Urashima&quot;, he believes he has spent 3 years at the otherworld or Dragon Palace, but more than 300 years had elapsed in the ancient and standard modern versions (700 years in the feudal period versions). The &quot;Mizukagami&quot; (1195) gives a more precise reckoning; Urashima supposedly returned in the 2nd year of Tenchō (825 AD), 347 years later. This matches the claim in &quot;Nihon shoki&quot; that he disappeared in the year of Yuraku 22, conventionally assigned the year 478. But it also means he did not come back until a century after the &quot;Nihon shoki&quot; was written.

== Hoderi and Hoori ==
In the mythology concerning the two princes Hoderi (&quot;Fire Flash&quot;) and Hoori (&quot;Fire Fade&quot;) in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, the latter younger brother adventures to the Sea God&#x27;s palace and emerges triumphant, and sires the line of emperors. The story has been often retold as fairytale, e.g. as &quot;The Princes Fire-flash &amp; Fire-fade&quot;.

The Sea-God&#x27;s palace, a &quot;palace built like fishes&#x27; scales&quot;, is interpreted to be a metaphor for a silver-colored structure.

== Local lore ==
In the Ryukyuan religion, Ryūgū-jō (Okinawan: &quot;Ruuguu&quot;) is the source of fire for all family and village hearths.

== Ryūgū-no-tsukai and Jinjahime ==
The Japanese name for the deep-sea dwelling giant oarfish is , literally &quot;messenger/servant of Ryūgū&quot; or &quot;Messenger from the Sea God&#x27;s Palace&quot;.

This real species of fish may have been the origins of the mythical , which also claimed to be a &quot;messenger/servant of Ryūgū&quot;. This , was a type of the so-called &quot;prophet beast&quot; (&quot;yogenjū&quot;) during the Edo period, which prophesied bountiful harvest followed by epidemic.

== Monuments ==

The Katase-Enoshima Station in Fujisawa, Kanagawa Prefecture is a structure built to resemble Ryūgū-jō, as a mock-up.

Ryūgū Shrine derives its name from Ryūgū-jō. Located on Cape Nagasakibana (also known as Cape Ryūgū) in southern Kagoshima, it is said to be where Urashima Tarō traveled to Ryūgū-jō. Locals honor Ryūjin and turtles as protectors.

<text>The International Motorcycling Federation (Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme) or (FIM) is the global governing/sanctioning body of motorcycle racing. It represents 122 national motorcycle federations that are divided into six continental unions.

There are seven motorcycle-racing disciplines that FIM covers, encompassing 82 world championships as well as hundreds of secondary championships: enduro, trial, circuit racing, motocross and supermoto, cross-country, e-bike, and track racing. FIM is also involved in many non-racing activities that promote the sport, its safety, and support relevant public policy. The FIM is also the first international sporting federation to publish an Environmental Code, in 1994. In 2007, a Commission for Women in Motorcycling was created by the FIM in order to promote the use of powered two-wheelers and the motorcycle sport among women.

==History==
The FIM was born from the &quot;Fédération Internationale des Clubs Motocyclistes&quot; (FICM), which itself was founded in Paris, France, on 21 December 1904. The British Auto-Cycle Union was one of the founding members. In 1906, the FICM was dissolved, but reborn in 1912 with the headquarters now located in England. The Six Days Reliability Trial was held the next year, the first international event held by the new incarnation.

The name was changed to the &quot;Fédération Internationale Motocycliste&quot; (FIM) in 1949, the same year that also saw the first race of the famed Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix. The headquarters were transferred to Geneva, Switzerland in 1959.

1994 saw the headquarters relocated, this time to Mies, Switzerland, and occupy its own building for the first time, shaped like a stylized motorcycle wheel. The name was changed again in 1998 to the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme at the congress in Cape Town, South Africa. The same year, the FIM was given provisional status of recognition by the International Olympic Committee, and gained full status in 2000 at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

2004 marked the organization&#x27;s centenary, and celebrations were held at the congress in Paris in October. Since 2018, Jorge Viegas (Portugal) is President of the &quot;FIM&quot;.

Due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, on March 6, 2022, &quot;FIM&quot; banned all Russian and Belarusian motorcycle riders, teams, officials, and competitions.

<doc id="664032" wikidata="Q706248" url="?curid=664032" title="William W. Belknap">
<text>William Worth Belknap (September 22, 1829 – October 12, 1890) was a lawyer, Union Army officer, government administrator in Iowa, and the 30th United States secretary of war, serving under President Ulysses S. Grant. Belknap was impeached on March 2, 1876, for his role in the trader post scandal but was acquitted by the Senate. Belknap was the first cabinet secretary in U.S. history to be impeached.

A native of New York, Belknap graduated from the College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, in 1848, studied law with a Georgetown attorney, and passed the bar in 1851. He moved to Iowa, where he practiced law in partnership with Ralph P. Lowe. Belknap entered politics as a Democrat and served one term in the Iowa House of Representatives. When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, Belknap joined the Union Army. A tall burly man, Belknap was a natural Union Army leader and recruiter. A veteran of the Iowa Home Guard who had attained the rank of captain, he was commissioned as a major in the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry. He took part in numerous engagements, including Shiloh, where he was wounded, and Corinth. He served as a regimental, brigade, division, and corps commander, and served in high-level staff positions. By the end of the war, Belknap had been promoted to brigadier general and received a brevet promotion to major general of volunteers.

After declining a regular Army commission, Belknap was appointed Iowa&#x27;s Collector of Internal Revenue by President Andrew Johnson; he served with distinction for four years. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Belknap as Secretary of War. During his tenure, Belknap ordered portraits of all the previous secretaries, intending to create a complete collection in honor of the United States Centennial. In 1871, Belknap was investigated by Congress, after he was directly involved in the sale of arms and munitions to France, while the United States was ostensibly neutral during the Franco-Prussian War. The same year, Belknap had arranged aid for victims of the catastrophic Chicago Fire.

During the Reconstruction era, Belknap&#x27;s War Department and the U.S. military worked under the supervision of President Ulysses S. Grant and the United States Attorney General&#x27;s office to occupy the former Confederacy and attempt to implement changes in government and the economy, while protecting freedmen from an increasingly violent insurgency. Belknap supported Grant&#x27;s Reconstruction policy, which most Democrats opposed.

In 1875, Grant, Belknap, and other members of Grant&#x27;s administration secretly agreed to remove troops from the Black Hills after gold was discovered. The US had protected the area from white settlers as part of a US treaty with the Lakota. The withdrawal of troops allowed a gold rush of white settlers to take place, and the US took &quot;de facto&quot; possession after the Lakota refused to sell their sacred lands. In 1876, the trader post scandal at Fort Sill led to Belknap&#x27;s sudden resignation, impeachment by the Democratic-controlled House, and trial by the Senate. While a majority of senators voted to convict, they lacked the two-thirds required, and Belknap was acquitted. Judge Arthur MacArthur Sr. dismissed Belknap&#x27;s Washington D. C. federal trial. Belknap resumed practicing law in Washington; he continued to be popular among Iowa Civil War veterans and was active until he died of a heart attack in 1890. One historian described Belknap as a man of both virtues and flaws, a talented lawyer, administrator, and military officer, but whose personal corruption overshadowed his positive qualities. Historians have largely forgotten Belknap&#x27;s heroic Union Civil War service.

==Early life and career==
William Worth Belknap was born in Newburgh, New York on September 22, 1829, the son of career soldier William G. Belknap and Anne Clark Belknap. Belknap&#x27;s father fought with distinction in the War of 1812, the Florida War, and Mexican–American War. Belknap attended the local schools in Newburgh, and graduated from the College of New Jersey at Princeton in 1848. In addition to attending Princeton with Hiester Clymer, the Democratic Congressman who later led the investigation into Belknap&#x27;s War Department corruption, Belknap was a college contemporary of Grant&#x27;s Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson, who was one year behind Clymer and Belknap at Princeton. After graduation, he studied law with Georgetown attorney Hugh E. Caperton. After passing an examination by Judge William Cranch in 1851, Belknap was admitted to the Washington, D.C. bar, and began looking for a place to settle and begin his career.

He moved west to Keokuk, Iowa, and entered into a partnership with Ralph P. Lowe. Deciding to make Iowa his permanent residence, in 1854, Belknap had a home built in Keokuk. He joined the Democratic Party and successfully ran for state office in 1856, serving in the Iowa House of Representatives from the 54th district between 1858 and 1860. Belknap was looked on as a rising Iowa Democratic leader. Belknap also joined a local company of the Iowa Home Guard, the Keokuk City Rifles, and he attained the rank of captain.

==Marriages and family==
In 1854 Belknap married Cora LeRoy, who died in 1862. They had one child together, Hugh R. Belknap, who served as a U.S. representative from Illinois. Belknap married Carita S. Tomlinson of Kentucky in January 1869; she died of tuberculosis shortly after childbirth in December 1870.

Belknap married again on December 11, 1873, to Amanda (&quot;née&quot; Tomlinson) Bower, his second wife&#x27;s widowed sister. They had a daughter, Alice Belknap, born November 28, 1874. Alice Belknap was considered one of Washington society&#x27;s most sought-after belles. In 1897 she reportedly converted to Judaism for her engagement to Paul May, an attaché of the Belgian legation in Washington. The engagement was broken the following year, and in June 1898 Alice Belknap married William Barklie Henry of Philadelphia.

==American Civil War==

When the American Civil War started, Belknap remained loyal to the Union as a pro-war Democrat. He first saw action in the Battle of Athens as the captain of the Keokuk City Rifles, a company of the Iowa Home Guard. He enlisted in the Union Army as a volunteer on November 7, 1861, and commissioned as a major. On December 7 he was mustered and tasked with raising and equipping the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry. Belknap was assigned to Companies F&amp;S. A rugged, charismatic and handsome man, Belknap was well-suited to the rigors of being a soldier. At over six feet tall and 200 pounds, with blue eyes, and fair hair, mustache, and beard, Belknap was regarded a natural leader described as &quot;a fine type of Saxon-American manhood&quot;. In addition, the public speaking skills and powers of persuasion he developed as a lawyer made him an effective recruiter. Belknap was a natural soldier, whose leadership skills, loud voice, and militia experience were assets in the training of newly enlisted privates.

===Shiloh, Corinth, and Vicksburg===

In March 1862, Maj. Belknap and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry were mustered into military action. Traveling by steamer from St. Louis, Belknap was sent to the front at the Battle of Shiloh; arriving at Pittsburgh Landing on April 6 joining the Army of the Tennessee, under the authority of Union General Ulysses S. Grant. Belknap and his men were ordered to the front to serve under Maj. Gen Benjamin M. Prentiss at the Hornet&#x27;s Nest. Belknap and his raw 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry troops were forced to fight like regular army veterans on Prentiss&#x27;s depleted line. Belknap was slightly wounded in the shoulder, and his horse was shot and killed from under him. Afterwards he continued on the field on foot. Reinforced, the Union Army under General Grant, forced the Confederates to retreat back to Corinth, and Shiloh was considered a Union victory.

After Shiloh, Belknap served as &quot;acting&quot; commander of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry at the Battle of Corinth. Col. Hugh T. Reid, commander of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry, had been severely injured in the neck at Shiloh and removed from active duty. Col. Reid stated that at Shiloh Belknap, &quot;was always in the right place at the right time, directing and encouraging officers and men as coolly as a veteran&quot; At Corinth, Belknap was noted for his &quot;conspicuous gallantry&quot;. After Corinth, Belknap and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry for a time served on guard duty. Belknap was formally promoted from major to lieutenant colonel on August 20, 1862. Belknap was promoted from lieutenant colonel to colonel of the Iowa 15th Volunteer Infantry on June 3, 1863.

The Union capture of Vicksburg, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi, was vital and would split the Confederacy in two. Belknap&#x27;s primary military operation took place at the Siege of Vicksburg until Confederate General John C. Pemberton surrendered to Union General Grant on July 4, 1863. Colonel Belknap, Fifteenth Iowa, was part of the Third Brigade of the Sixth Division serving under Major General John McArthur.

On December 24, 1863, Belknap was in command of the 11th Iowa Volunteer Infantry and the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry reinforcing Redbone, Mississippi, south of Vicksburg. On February 26, 1864, Belknap served as provost marshal of post in Canton, Mississippi.

===Battle of Atlanta, Battle of Ezra Church, and March to the Sea===
On June 8, 1864, Col. Belknap and the veteran 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry were transferred to the 4th Division, XVII Corps at Ackworth, Georgia. On July 22, 1864, at the Battle of Atlanta, Belknap served with distinction, fighting against the 45th Alabama Infantry. Belknap and his Iowa troops dug in and set up earthworks and a parapet around Bald Hill. The 45th Alabama infantry led by Confederate Col. Harris D. Lampley, assaulted the entrenched Union line two times but were repelled by massive Union gun power. On the second attempt, Lampley and his remaining men crossed over to the Union line for hand-to-hand combat. Lampley, who had been shot, cursed his men who had fallen or were retreating. In the midst of the fierce fighting the burly Belknap grabbed the wounded Lampley by the collar, spun him around to face the Confederate lines, and shouted, &quot;Look at your men! They are dead! What are you cursing them for!?&quot; Belknap took the wounded Lampley prisoner; he was held until his death on August 24.

William H. Chamberlain of the 81st Ohio Infantry Regiment later wrote: &quot;The next day [July 23, 1864] I remember seeing Colonel Wm. W. Belknap of the 15th Iowa (afterward Brigadier-General and Secretary of War). He was a brawny, red-bearded giant in appearance, and it was told of him that he had captured a number of prisoners by pulling them over the breastworks by main force, so closely were the lines engaged.&quot;

On July 28, 1864, at the Battle of Ezra Church, Belknap was in charge of the 15th Iowa Volunteer Infantry and the 32nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, which reinforced Maj. Gen. Morgan Lewis Smith&#x27;s XV Corps. On July 30, Belknap was promoted to brigadier general as commander of the 4th Division, XVII Corps, and participated in Major Gen. Sherman&#x27;s operations in Georgia and the Carolinas. After Atlanta was taken by the Union Army, Belknap accompanied Maj. Gen. Sherman on his March to the Sea. Belknap was promoted to Brevet Major General of Volunteers on March 13, 1865, as a reward for his bravery in the Atlanta Campaign. Having declined a regular Army commission, on August 24, 1865, Belknap was mustered out of the U.S. Army.

==Iowa Collector of Internal Revenue (1865–1869)==
In 1865, President Andrew Johnson appointed Belknap Collector of Internal Revenue for Iowa&#x27;s 1st District. In this position, Belknap was responsible for collecting millions of dollars in federal taxes; collectors were paid a percentage of the revenue they brought in, which made the position lucrative and highly sought after. Belknap served for four years until he was appointed Secretary of War by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. During his term as Collector, which coincided with the Reconstruction Era, Belknap associated himself with the Republican Party. Belknap served with distinction; when his Collector&#x27;s accounts were settled, they were accurate to within four cents.

==Secretary of War (1869–1876)==

On the advice of General of the Army William T. Sherman, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Belknap to Secretary of War on October 25, 1869, to take the place of Secretary John A. Rawlins, who had died in office of tuberculosis. Sherman himself had served briefly as acting secretary of war, after Rawlins&#x27;s death. Belknap was seen as a protégé of Sherman&#x27;s, having fought in the Atlanta Campaign and accompanied him on Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. President Grant believed Belknap had served capably during the American Civil War and deserved to head the War Department.

After his appointment, Belknap implemented or recommended several positive initiatives. He recommended that Congress act to fix the date of May 1 as the start of the fiscal year, allowing for more accurate accounting of department funds. He inaugurated the preparation of historical reports by post commanders as a way to document their activities for posterity, and proposed actions to preserve Yellowstone National Park. Not all of Belknap&#x27;s actions were well received, however. He bypassed Sherman when making appointments, and reduced Sherman&#x27;s budget, thus weakening the authority of the General of the Army position.

In 1874, Sherman responded by leaving Washington and moving his headquarters to St. Louis. Major General Oliver O. Howard was also ostracized by Belknap. While stationed in Oregon, in 1874, Major General Howard candidly expressed his opinion of Belknap. Howard stated that Belknap was deceptive to &quot;General Grant&quot;, that Belknap was not a true Republican, and that he associated nightly with &quot;foul-mouthed&quot; Democratic Kentucky associates. Howard also opined that Belknap was &quot;not in favor&quot; of the President&#x27;s Indian Peace policy. That statement is likely related to a conflict, during Belknap&#x27;s tenure, between the War and Interior Departments as to which would exercise control over American Indian policy. In the context of this era, Belknap&#x27;s actions may not be seen as overly aggressive or overreaching. In terms of Reconstruction, historian Jean Edward Smith, notes that Grant, a former General of the Army, personally supervised the use of the U.S. military and that Belknap &quot;had less freedom of action than other cabinet members.&quot; Belknap held office for 6 years, 4 months, and 7 days.

===War Department portrait gallery (1869)===
Upon assuming office in 1869, Belknap conceived the idea of creating portraits of previous civilian heads of the War Department in honor of the upcoming 1876 U.S. Centennial, and hired renowned artists Daniel Huntington, Robert Weir, and Henry Ulke. Belknap&#x27;s portrait was painted by Huntington in 1874. The portraits were assembled into a distinct collection to be viewed by the public. The portrait initiative was continued by Belknap&#x27;s successors; in addition to secretaries, the collection came to include others notable for their military distinction. This effort at historic preservation was considered a success, and Belknap received &quot;unqualified credit&quot; for his creation of the War Department portrait gallery.

=== Indian ring (1870–1876)===
During the summer of 1870, Belknap successfully lobbied Congress to grant him the sole power to appoint and license agents, known as sutlers, with ownership rights to highly lucrative &quot;traderships&quot; at U.S. military forts in the Western frontier. These monopoly traderships were considered good investments during the Gilded Age and were highly sought after. On July 15, the Commanding General of the Army&#x27;s power to appoint traderships was repealed, empowering Belknap while further eroding Sherman&#x27;s authority.

To ensure maximum profits, Belknap ordered soldiers stationed at forts having Belknap-approved sutlers to buy supplies only through the authorized traderships. Soldiers on the Western frontier, who were thus forced to buy goods at exorbitant prices that far exceeded the usual rate, were left in debt or destitute as a result. One 7th Cavalry Sergeant noted that a shot of whiskey &quot;mostly glass&quot; cost 25 cents (.25¢ &quot;1871&quot; = $5.40 &quot;2019&quot;) glass, at a time when soldiers were paid a few dollars ($1.00 &quot;1871&quot; = $21.60 &quot;2019&quot;) a month.

Hostile American Indians bought supplies at these traderships, including high-quality single-shot breech-loaders and repeating rifles. At the same time, Army requisitions for rifles were filled by Belknap&#x27;s War Department with inferior single-shot breech-loaders that jammed frequently, and were no match for superior breech-loaders and repeating rifles. The policy had a negative effect on the firepower of the U.S. troops and may have contributed to the defeat of George Armstrong Custer and the 7th Cavalry at Battle of the Little Big Horn in June 1876, several months after Belknap was out of office. (However, Custer had also decided against bringing Gatling guns; these would have increased Custer&#x27;s firepower, even if his troops had been armed with inferior rifles.)

Belknap&#x27;s second wife, Carita, was socially ambitious and unwilling to live in Washington, D.C., on Belknap&#x27;s $8,000 annual salary (about $157,000 in 2018). When the couple arrived in Washington from Keokuk, Iowa in 1869, Belknap rented a large house recently vacated by Secretary of State William H. Seward. In hosting large parties, a typical social requirement for cabinet members, the Belknaps overextended their invitations; one of their events had 1,200 guests, including many young army officers; the resulting raucous behavior led to extensive damage and vandalism, including destruction of curtains, couches, and other furniture. The Belknaps could not afford to pay for the damages, and were faced with leaving Washington society and reducing expenses by living in a boarding house, or finding a way to increase their income.

They decided to look for additional income, and Carita engineered a plan to obtain a lucrative &quot;cash cow&quot; Indian tradership position at the recently built Fort Sill, located in the Oklahoma Indian Territory. Carita lobbied her husband to appoint a New York contractor, Caleb P. Marsh, to the Fort Sill tradership; John S. Evans, an experienced sutler, had already been appointed and did not want to give it up. To settle the question, Marsh drew up an illicit partnership contract that allowed Evans to keep the tradership at Fort Sill, provided that he pay Marsh $12,000 per year in quarterly installments (approximately $236,000 in 2018). Marsh, in turn, was required to give half of his $12,000 to Carita, also in quarterly installments. All the parties agreed to the arrangement; however, Carita received only one payment before her death from tuberculosis after childbirth in December 1870.

After Carita&#x27;s death, Marsh continued to pay the quarterly share of the profits to Carita&#x27;s younger sister Amanda, known as &quot;Puss&quot;, who had moved in with the Belknaps, ostensibly to hold as a trust fund for the benefit of Carita&#x27;s child. This profiteering arrangement between Amanda and Marsh was all done with Belknap&#x27;s full knowledge and consent. After Carita&#x27;s child died in June 1871, Amanda left to tour Europe, and Belknap continued to take the quarterly bribery payments until December 1873, when Amanda returned and became Belknap&#x27;s third wife. Amanda was a beautiful young socialite; intending to keep the modest fortune she inherited from her family while also attaining a high position in Washington society, she required Belknap to sign a prenuptial agreement.

Belknap rented a large new house on G Street, which had been built by Orville Babcock, President Grant&#x27;s personal secretary. From that time onward, Belknap and Amanda continued to accept Marsh&#x27;s quarterly payments. Amanda was considered to be more self-indulgent than her sister Carita, donning gorgeous gowns, jewelry and other accessories for parties and other events, and called the &quot;spendthrift belle&quot; by Washington society. The Belknaps&#x27; extravagant lifestyle entertaining Washington society, holding lavish parties, and wearing elegant clothes, created envy among both Democratic political figures and permanent residents of Washington. However, that the Belknaps were receiving kickbacks was not publicly known until February 1876, when the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives launched an investigation, which discovered that Belknap and his wives had received about $20,000 (approximately $394,000 in 2018) in bribes from Marsh.

===French arms sales (1870)===
During the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871, the United States declared neutrality. Belknap had been accused by Grant administration critics, including Senators Charles Sumner and Carl Schurz, of violating neutrality and selling arms to French agents. In fact, Belknap had sold obsolete U.S. War Department firearms to a neighbor of the Remington family, which owned the E. Remington and Sons firearms and ammunition company. Samuel Remington, as an arms-selling agent to the French Government, then arranged the sale of those firearms to France. Belknap subsequently sold 54,000,000 cartridges to the French Armycartridges that would specifically fit the firearms he had previously sold to the Remington neighbor. A Congressional investigation that took place in 1872 exonerated Belknap.

===Pardoned Cadet Smith (1871)===
During the Reconstruction Era, former slave James Webster Smith became the first African American cadet to enroll at West Point. After starting classes in 1870, Smith was immediately and severely hazed by white cadets. One of Belknap&#x27;s nephews, a cadet at the academy, had been reprimanded (but not otherwise punished) for hazing Smith. In another instance, Smith was arrested and taken to a military court for fighting a white cadet, though Smith said he had merely defended himself. Major General Oliver O. Howard, an advocate for African-American civil rights and in charge of the trial, acquitted Smith and gave him a light punishment for unruly conduct. This outraged the academy&#x27;s &quot;Bureau of Military Justice&quot;, who made a formal protest to Belknap on November 20, 1870. In another hazing incident, in January 1871, Smith was arrested for supposedly not holding his head up when marching, again after being severely harassed by white cadets.

With Howard now reassigned to the western United States, the academy&#x27;s administration determined to force Smith out. This time he was convicted; his case was then appealed to Belknap. Smith had been recommended for expulsion, but Belknap intervened with President Grant, who changed the sentence to setting Smith back academically, which caused him to repeat his Plebe year. Smith continued at West Point until 1874, when Professor Peter S. Michie, a white supremacist, gave Smith a private test, in defiance of traditional West Point practice, and claimed that Smith had failed. Smith was then denied a chance to retest and was forced out of West Point.

Belknap concurred when Major General Thomas H. Ruger, appointed superintendent of West Point in 1871, reduced the hazing of cadets by 1873 and made strong efforts to eradicate the &quot;discreditable&quot; practice. Belknap admired Ruger&#x27;s performance as West Point Superintendent and stated, &quot;I am pretty satisfied with the success of your management, and private conversations with officers of all grades, &amp; with civilians too, who have been there since your accession...&quot; Other African Americans followed Smith&#x27;s entrance into West Point and Henry O. Flipper became the first to graduate from the academy in 1877. In 1997, President Bill Clinton attempted to acknowledge and right the wrong done to Smith by awarding him a posthumous commission as a second lieutenant.

===Aiding Chicago fire victims (1871)===
From October 8 to October 10, 1871, a devastating fire burned and destroyed much of Chicago, killing hundreds of people and causing $200,000,000 (nearly $4 billion in 2018) in damages. Over 100,000 citizens were left destitute and homeless. Belknap took prompt action on October 9, ordering food sent from St. Louis, tents from Jefferson Barracks, and two companies of troops from Fort Omaha to help keep peace and order. On October 10, Belknap in writing a dispatch to Lt. General Philip Sheridan stated that the fire was &quot;...a national calamity. The sufferers have the sincere sympathy of the nation.&quot; Belknap ordered military officers around the nation to send supplies to Chicago &quot;liberally and promptly&quot;.

In his Annual Report to President Grant in December 1871, Belknap praised the War Department for the efficiency of operations in aiding the homeless and destitute of the Chicago Fire within hours of notification, while the fire was still in progress. Belknap also praised Sheridan and the several companies of troops under his command for keeping law and order in the ruined city.

===Requested prisoner and prison reform (1871)===
In the summer of 1871, a U.S. Board of military officers visited the Quebec, Canada military prison run by the British Army. The board recommended that British methods be adopted in the U.S. Army, including a system of rewards for good behavior, and difficult physical exercise and taxing military drill and ceremony as punishments, with the goals of returning prisoners to military duty at the end of their sentences and preventing re-offenses. Belknap approved the board&#x27;s recommendations and requested Congress incorporate the British system into the U.S. military, and also requested that funding for the new program be paid for by having soldiers forfeit their pay during the time of their incarceration.

===New Orleans 1872 street riot===
During Reconstruction Grant enforced civil and voting rights for African Americans in the South, using the army and newly created Justice Department to destroy the Ku Klux Klan in 1871, under the Enforcement Acts. Louisiana during Reconstruction was one of the most politically turbulent, violent, and disputed states. Rival political factions fought for power in the state government, and white insurgents frequently attacked freedmen and their sympathizers, requiring the deployment of federal troops to keep peace.

During January 1872, the War Department was kept on high alert, concerned with the potential for violent confrontation in New Orleans between Gov. Henry Clay Warmoth&#x27;s faction and that of George W. Carter, former speaker of the Louisiana House. Warmoth supported social equality and voting rights for African Americans, but southern conservatives considered him a corrupt northern carpetbagger. To prevent disorder Major General William H. Emory, Louisville District Commander, in charge of New Orleans, decided that federal troops were needed to prevent violence. Belknap informed General-in-Chief William T. Sherman, supporting Emory&#x27;s request. On January 5, federal troops were deployed in New Orleans to prevent violence, and were intended to occupy the area until January 11. Sec. Belknap advised President Grant that Emory was the best to make the decision about use of the forces.

On January 9, a street riot broke out after a Gov. Warmoth supporter was assassinated; Gov. Warmoth&#x27;s state police retaliated by attacking and dispersing Carter&#x27;s faction at the Gem Saloon. Emory deployed reinforcement troops on January 10 to restore order. On January 12, Grant, wanting to stay out of state politics, told the mayor of New Orleans through the War Department that he would not declare martial law in Louisiana. An angry mob of thousands of Carter&#x27;s men took to the streets. Emory deployed troops equipped with Gatling guns. Carter&#x27;s men dispersed, believing that Emory would use U.S. military force to keep the peace.

On January 15, Grant wrote to Belknap that he desired to prevent the &quot;danger of bloodshed&quot; without having to take sides with either faction. On January 16, Att. Gen. George H. Williams told Gov. Warmoth that Grant would take sides only if there was a &quot;clear case of legal right and overruling necessity.&quot; On January 22, learning that Gov. Warmoth and Carter had formed rival militias and were preparing for violence, President Grant issued orders through the War Department for Emory to use troops if necessary. When Emory communicated Grant&#x27;s message to both Gov. Warmoth and Carter, they dispersed their factions and kept peace for 10 months.

===Eads Bridge commission (1873)===

In 1873, the construction of the Americas&#x27; first steel arched bridge, named after James B. Eads, was nearing completion in St. Louis. Belknap, under influence from the Keokuk Packet steamliner company, was opposed to its completion. He desired that the bridge be torn down, so steamers would not have to lower their smokestacks to sail under it. Belknap created a commission to make recommendations on either destroying the bridge and rebuilding it with a design that allowed steamers to pass or building a canal around the bridge so that they could pass. Eads, who was friends with Grant, visited Washington, D.C., in November 1873 before Belknap submitted the report to Congress, and asked that Grant rescue the bridge from destruction. Belknap argued that according to federal law, the Secretary of War had the authority to prevent obstruction of the Mississippi River.

In response, Grant reminded Belknap that Congress had authorized the construction of the bridge, and that Congress would probably not authorize money to tear it down. He overruled Belknap&#x27;s decision, and told Belknap in person, &quot;You certainly cannot destroy this structure on your own authority...General, you had better drop this case.&quot; Belknap was embarrassed, stood up blushing, bowed to President Grant, and left the meeting. The Eads Bridge was completed in 1874 and is still in active use today.

===Preserved Mathew Brady Civil War photos (1874)===
In 1872, photographer Mathew Brady went bankrupt; his possessions, including photographs and negatives, were sold to satisfy creditors. In 1874, the owner of a warehouse in New York City offered a set of over 2,000 Brady negatives for sale; Belknap authorized their purchase for $2,500. The negatives were not packed or transported with care, and by the time the War Department took possession, about one-third of them were damaged or destroyed.

Brady subsequently complained to Belknap that none of the $2,500 had gone to him or any of his creditors. During the discussion, Brady offered to sell a second set of negatives; Congress appropriated up to $25,000 for the purchase, and after reviewing the materials and obtaining advice from a War Department attorney as to their value, Belknap authorized payment in full.

As a result of Belknap&#x27;s initiative, the War Department acquired over 6,000 images of the Civil War era, including photos of prominent military and government officials, battlefields, and defensive works. This collection was subsequently combined with other collections of Brady photos which were purchased by the federal government; they were later catalogued, and are maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration and the Library of Congress.

===Yellowstone expedition (1875)===
During the summer of 1875, Belknap decided to explore Yellowstone the nation&#x27;s first national park, created as the result of a law signed by President Grant on March 2, 1872. Accompanying Belknap were Colonel Randolph B. Marcy, Lieutenant Colonel James W. Forsyth, and Chicago businessman William E. Strong. Leading the expedition was Lieutenant Gustavus C. Doane, who had led the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition in 1870, the first extensive federal survey of the Yellowstone territory, that was responsible in part for the formation of the park. Doane left Fort Ellis, where he was stationed, and made preparations for Belknap&#x27;s party&#x27;s arrival at Mammoth Hot Springs.

On July 26, Belknap&#x27;s party reached Fort Ellis and proceeded to meet Doane. Led by Doane, Belknap&#x27;s party attempted to retrace the original 1870 Expedition in addition to hunting for any big game found on the journey. Belknap&#x27;s party included 24 soldiers and two ambulances. The two-week expedition proved to be troublesome as Doane was unable to find big game to hunt and after briefly viewing the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone, Belknap&#x27;s party had to wait several hours before Doane finally found the trail.

===Great Sioux War (1876)===
In late July 1874, a U.S. Army expedition under Col. George A. Custer discovered gold in the Black Hills. Soon many gold miners were trespassing on land granted to the Indians under the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. In June 1875, President Grant attempted to resolve the problem by offering Indians $100,000 per year to lease their land or $6,000,000 for the Black Hills. The Lakota Sioux under Chief Red Cloud refused since the offer would require the Sioux to be moved to the Indian Territory in Oklahoma.

On November 3, 1875, as the crisis escalated, President Grant held a secret meeting at the White House including Belknap, Secretary of Interior Zachariah Chandler and general Philip Sheridan. Sheridan told Grant that the U.S. Army was undermanned and the territory involved was vast, requiring great numbers of soldiers to enforce the treaty. Grant, Belknap, and Chandler agreed to a plan that would withdraw U.S. troops from the Black Hills, allowing miners to mine on Indian Territory. According to historian Jeffrey Ostler, the purpose of the troop withdrawal was to start an Indian war.

On December 3, 1875, Chandler ordered all Indians to return to their respected reservations, however, militant Indians under Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse refused to return. By January 1876, 4,000 miners illegally occupied Indian land. When hostile Indians refused to leave their hunting grounds by the January 31 deadline, Chandler turned the Indians over to Belknap&#x27;s War Department stating &quot;the said Indians are hereby turned over to the War Department for such action on the part of the Army as you [Belknap] may deem proper under the circumstances.&quot;

On February 8, 1876, Generals Crook and Terry were ordered to start winter military campaigns against hostile Indians and the Great Sioux War commenced. On March 1, 1876, Crook, in freezing weather, marched north from Fort Fetterman near Douglas, Wyoming to attack Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse and their Indian followers on the Powder River. The following day, March 2, Belknap abruptly resigned office over the Fort Sill trader post-scandal. From March 3 to March 7 the War Department was run &quot;ad interim&quot; under Secretary of Navy George M. Robeson. On March 8, 1876 Alphonso Taft was appointed by Grant Secretary of War. The Great Sioux War ended in April 1877 under President Rutherford B. Hayes.

===Corruption, resignation, and House impeachment (1876)===


On February 29, 1876, rumors that Belknap was receiving profits from traderships reached Representative Hiester Clymer, chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. In response, Clymer launched an investigation into the War Department. Although Clymer and Belknap were friends and had been college roommates, Clymer was a racist against black Americans who strongly opposed Republican Reconstruction. During Belknap&#x27;s tenure, the Army was used in combination with the Justice Department to prosecute the Ku Klux Klan, a policy opposed by most Democrats. Caleb P. Marsh testified to the Clymer Committee that Belknap had personally taken Fort Sill tradership profit payments as part of the partnership agreement between Marsh and John S. Evans. On February 29, 1876, Belknap and his counsel went before Clymer&#x27;s committee, but Belknap declined to testify.

On the morning of March 2, Treasury Secretary Benjamin Bristow told President Grant of Belknap&#x27;s impending impeachment. After Grant finished breakfast, Secretary Belknap and Secretary Chandler arrived at the White House. Belknap was extremely anxious, openly wept, and confessed to Grant. Belknap handed Grant a one-sentence resignation letter. Grant personally wrote a letter accepting Belknap&#x27;s resignation, which he placed on a White House mantel at 10:20a.m.

Clymer&#x27;s committee was informed at 11:00a.m. of Belknap&#x27;s resignation. Although Belknap&#x27;s resignation initially caused commotion among House members, it did not prevent action by the Clymer committee. The chairman of the House Managers cited authority that as a rule, the law does not recognize fractions of a day and the House saw no cause to make an exception in this case. The committee unanimously passed resolutions to impeach Belknap and drew up five articles of impeachment to be sent to the Senate; thus Belknap had both resigned and would be impeached at &quot;the same time&quot; on March 2, 1876, by a unanimous vote of the House of Representatives. This was the first of two times in US history that a cabinet secretary was ever impeached, the second being the impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas in 2024.

Speaker of the House Michael C. Kerr wrote to the Senate that Belknap resigned &quot;with intent to evade the proceedings of impeachment against him,&quot; although within a few years of the 1797 impeachment of Senator Blount a number of officers including several judges had been threatened with impeachment and resigned to avoid it, after which the proceedings against them were abandoned.

On March 29 and April 4, 1876, George Armstrong Custer testified before the Clymer Committee, which continued to gather evidence for the Senate trial. Custer&#x27;s testimony was a national media sensation because he accused both Grant&#x27;s brother and the Secretary of War of corruption. Although Belknap had resigned, he had many political allies in Washington, D.C., including Grant. Custer had previously arrested Grant&#x27;s son Fred, an Army officer, on the charge of drunkenness. As the result of that incident and his testimony to the Clymer Committee, Custer incurred Grant&#x27;s displeasure. It took more than a month for Custer to resolve the situation and obtain Grant&#x27;s permission to return to duty, leading his regiment in the expedition that would culminate with Custer&#x27;s death at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.

Upon Belknap&#x27;s sudden resignation in March, Grant had to hastily ask his secretary of navy George M. Robeson to run the War Department &quot;ad interim&quot;, which lasted a week. Grant then appointed Alphonso Taft Secretary of War; Taft was an attorney and former judge; unfamiliar with military matters, he reluctantly agreed to serve in order to stabilize the War Department, and Grant promised to nominate him later for another, more suitable position. In May, Grant kept his word when he created a vacancy in the attorney general&#x27;s post by naming the incumbent, Edwards Pierrepont, to serve as Minister to England; he then appointed Taft to serve as attorney general, and J. Donald Cameron to succeed Taft as secretary of war.

==Senate trial, house arrest, and Senate acquittal==
Starting on April 5, 1876, Belknap was tried by the Senate with President pro tempore Thomas W. Ferry presiding. For several weeks senators argued over whether the Senate had jurisdiction to put Belknap on trial since he had already resigned office in March. Belknap&#x27;s defense managers argued that the Senate had no jurisdiction; the Senate ruled by a vote of 37–29 that it did. Belknap was charged with five articles of impeachment, and the Senate listened to over 40 witnesses. With 40 votes needed for conviction, 25 senators voted no on each of five counts, while the yes votes were 35, 36, 36, 36, and 37, thus acquitting Belknap by failing to reach the required two-thirds majority. All Senators agreed that Belknap took the money from Marsh, but 23 who voted for acquittal believed the Senate did not have jurisdiction. Grant&#x27;s speedy acceptance of Belknap&#x27;s resignation undoubtedly saved him from conviction.

After the trial, Belknap&#x27;s wife and children traveled extensively in Europe. Former senator Matthew H. Carpenter of Wisconsin, who had defended Belknap at the Senate trial, said that Belknap was entirely innocent and that if he outlived Belknap he would clear Belknap&#x27;s name. Carpenter was reelected to the Senate in 1879, but was in ill health; he died in February 1881 and never produced any new evidence.

On March 4, 1876, one month prior to his Senate impeachment trial, Grant&#x27;s Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont had Belknap arrested; as a foe of the Tweed Ring in New York, Pierrepont was seen as a lawyer of integrity, and Grant named him as attorney general to promote reform and anti-corruption within Grant&#x27;s administration. Grant, who as former commanding general put more scrutiny into military matters than presidents usually did, had ordered Pierrepont to launch a criminal investigation into Belknap&#x27;s War department. Much to Belknap&#x27;s anger, Pierrepont put an armed guard around his home to ensure he did not attempt to flee. In May 1876, Grant named Pierrepont Minister to Britain, and appointed his Secretary of War Alphonso Taft to be attorney general.

==Washington, D.C., indictment (1876–1877)==
After Belknap&#x27;s Senate acquittal on August 1, the guards around his house were removed; he was indicted by a grand jury on the same day, and set for trial in the District of Columbia federal court. However, journalists and other observers were of the view that the district courts were unlikely to convict, given the number of Grant administration officials who had been accused of corruption and received little or no punishment.

Belknap remained angry at Pierrepont, and threatened to sue him for false imprisonment. On February 2, 1877, Belknap visited Grant and pleaded for his indictment to be dismissed. The next day Grant asked his cabinet for advice; Secretary of State Hamilton Fish was furious at Belknap and wanted him to be tried. Grant decided otherwise, and wrote to Taft that the district attorney should be directed to dismiss the case.

Following Grant&#x27;s instructions, Taft told Washington, D.C. District Attorney Henry H. Wells that the evidence against Belknap would not sustain a conviction, and that Belknap had suffered enough during the Senate trial. Wells moved for dismissal; on February 8, 1877, Belknap&#x27;s case, indictment No. 11,262, was dismissed by Justice Arthur MacArthur Sr. No longer facing the possibility of conviction and imprisonment, Belknap decided not to follow through on his threat to sue Pierrepont.

==Later career==

Having been disgraced by the Senate trial, Belknap sought to escape from the scrutiny and disapproval of Washington society by moving to Philadelphia. The Belknaps remained married; Amanda and the children visited the Catskills, Coney Island, and other resorts, and Belknap saw them periodically. Belknap later resided in Keokuk, where he practiced law that largely involved representing railroads. Although he was no longer involved in politics or government, Belknap often returned to Washington to represent clients, and maintained a residence and office there.

Years after his impeachment, Belknap&#x27;s reputation publicly still remained damaged by corruption charges. During the 1880 presidential race, he was among those lampooned in a &quot;Puck&quot; magazine cartoon (&quot;Grant the Acrobat&quot;, by Joseph Ferdinand Keppler) opposing Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s bid for a third term.

One historian, L.D. Ingersoll, however, defended Belknap in 1880, saying &quot;General Belknap came out of the terrible ordeal with &quot;troops of friends&quot; still standing behind him, notably old army comrades in the army and those who were especially familiar with his conduct of the general affairs of the War Department. These with many public men of the highest standing, insist that he is a much abused man.&quot;

Belknap remained popular among his fellow Civil War veterans; in 1887, Belknap coauthored the book &quot;History of the Fifteenth Regiment, Iowa Veteran Volunteer Infantry&quot;.

==Death, burial and memorial==
Belknap died suddenly from a massive heart attack in Washington, D.C. on Sunday October 12, 1890. The &quot;New York Times&quot; stated that his death occurred on Sunday between 1:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m., and that he died alone at his residence in the Evans building on New York Avenue. Prior to his death, Belknap had played cards with his friends on Saturday night, then retired upstairs for the evening. Belknap&#x27;s wife, Amanda, was in New York City at the time.

At 8:30 a.m. on Monday morning, Belknap&#x27;s business associate, John W. Cameron, picked up Belknap&#x27;s mail on the first floor of Belknap&#x27;s home, where he maintained his law office, and proceeded to the second floor, where Belknap lived. Cameron and a maid found that all the rooms had been locked. A janitor was summoned to open the doors, and a step ladder was used to peer into Belknap&#x27;s bedroom. Belknap had placed his hat and coat on a chair and his lifeless body was found on his bed. His left arm had been raised toward his head with his left hand tightly clenched. The bed clothes were disheveled and he appeared to have struggled for breath. The physician who initially examined the body stated that he had died of apoplexy; however, an autopsy by the coroner revealed that Belknap suffered from heart disease. The War Department was notified and received with &quot;genuine sorrow&quot; the news of Belknap&#x27;s death, since Belknap had been a popular Secretary of War.

Belknap was buried in Section 1 at Arlington National Cemetery on October 16, 1890. The ceremony was conducted by St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The site features a granite gravestone with a bronze relief memorial designed by sculptor Carl Rohl-Smith. The bronze relief (2 ft. x 2 ft.) bust shows Belknap wearing a dress uniform with his hair parted on the right side as well as a long, full beard. The relief is located on the front of a granite base (6 ft. x 5 ft. x 5 ft.). This piece was surveyed by the Smithsonian&#x27;s Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1995 and its condition was described as &quot;Treatment being needed&quot;. The relief is signed by the artist: C.R. 1897.

A plaque on the front of the granite base is inscribed:

==Historical reputation==

Prior to Belknap&#x27;s 1876 shocking resignation, Belknap&#x27;s reputation was one of a war hero who honorably served the Union Army. There were no rumors of corruption while he served under Johnson as a Treasury collector. Even up to 1876, Belknap, under Grant, was believed to be a faithful judicious Secretary of War, publicly recognized for aiding and protecting 100,000 homeless Chicago fire victims.

In 2003 biographer Edward S. Cooper described Belknap as a man of virtues and flaws. According to Cooper, Belknap &quot;willingly turned to graft to support the social ambitions of his wives&quot; while living a lavish lifestyle in Washington, D.C., at the expense of soldiers and Indians during the Gilded Age. Belknap is positively credited by Cooper for creating and expanding the weather bureau, reforming the military justice system, and for preserving Mathew Brady&#x27;s photographic record of the Civil War. Belknap&#x27;s abrupt and controversial resignation in March 1876 caused an unprecedented succession of four Secretaries of War within a 13-month time period: Belknap, Alphonso Taft, J. Donald Cameron, and George W. McCrary.

In Keokuk, Belknap is remembered for being one of its &quot;colorful citizens&quot; and he has two streets named after him. He was commended by his Army colleagues for his coolness under fire during the Civil War, but his reputation suffered as the result of his forced resignation as Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War, which took place under a cloud amid suspicions of misconduct.
Belknap&#x27;s name resurfaced in January 2021, due to the similarity between Belknap&#x27;s 1876 impeachment trial and President Donald Trump&#x27;s 2021 impeachment trial, since both had left office by the time the trial had commenced.

Andra Belknap, a Belknap descendant, said, &quot;William Worth Belknap was by many accounts a hero of the Civil War. He served the Union Army, and during the Battle of Shiloh, he was injured and had his horse shot down under him. And still, he continued in battle. During the Battle of Atlanta, he personally took a Confederate officer prisoner (supposedly dragging the man by the collar across the battlefield). His Civil War heroism, however, has been largely forgotten by history — even forgotten by his own family. His impeachment is what remains in the history books.&quot; 

==Legacy==
A collection of his family&#x27;s records and papers and several boxes of letters received by Belknap are located at Princeton University, where he was a member of the class of 1848.

His son Hugh R. Belknap served as a U.S. congressman from Illinois.

Mount Belknap in Utah is named in his honor.

Donald Cameron, and one under President Rutherford B. Hayes, George W. McCrary.

<text>Mark Allen (born January 12, 1958, in Glendale, California) is an American triathlete and six-time Ironman Triathlon World Champion.

== Education ==
He graduated from UC San Diego, where he was an All-American swimmer, with a degree in biology.

== Career==
After competing and losing in the Ironman Triathlon Championships six times (often to Dave Scott), Allen emerged victorious in 1989, winning one of the most difficult one-day sporting events in the world.

This was the first of six Ironman victories for Allen, the last coming in 1995 at age 37, making him the oldest winner of the event at that time. He has also excelled at the Olympic distance, winning the sport&#x27;s inaugural World Championships in 1989 in Avignon, France, by more than a minute. He was undefeated in 10 trips to the Nice International Championships, and from 1988 to 1990 he had a winning streak of 21 races.

Over the course of his racing career, which ended in 1996, he maintained a 90% average in top-three finishes. He was named Triathlete of the Year six times by &quot;Triathlete&quot; magazine, and in 1997 &quot;Outside&quot; magazine dubbed him The World&#x27;s Fittest Man. Allen was inducted into the Ironman Triathlon Hall of Fame in 1997. He has also been inducted into the USAT Hall of Fame and the ITU Hall of Fame.

Allen has summarized his career in four characters: &quot;1-6-21-infinity&quot;. &quot;1&quot; is for his victory in the first official triathlon World Championship. &quot;6&quot; is for the six times he won the Ironman. 21 stands for his two season run of 21 straight victories, along the way defeating every one of the top 50 triathletes in the world. &quot;Infinity&quot; represents his acknowledgement by ESPN as &quot;The Greatest Endurance Athlete of All Time.&quot;

Allen owns and operates Mark Allen Coaching, a global online triathlon coaching concern.

<doc id="664039" wikidata="Q987262" url="?curid=664039" title="Virginia City, Nevada">
<text>Virginia City is a census-designated place (CDP) that is the county seat of Storey County, Nevada, United States, and the largest community in the county. The city is a part of the Reno–Sparks Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Virginia City developed as a boomtown with the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode, the first major silver deposit discovery in the United States, with numerous mines opening. The population peaked in the mid-1870s, with an estimated 25,000 residents. The mines&#x27; output declined after 1878, and the population declined as a result. As of the 2020 Census, the population of Virginia City was 787.

== History ==

Peter O&#x27;Riley and Patrick McLaughlin are credited with the discovery of the Comstock Lode. Henry T. P. Comstock&#x27;s name was associated with the discovery through his own machinations. According to folklore, James Fennimore, nicknamed Old Virginny Finney, christened the town when he tripped and broke a bottle of whiskey at a saloon entrance in the northern section of Gold Hill, soon to become Virginia City.

In another story, the Ophir Diggings were named in honor of Finney as he was &quot;one of the first discoverers of that mining locality, and one of the most successful prospectors in that region&quot;. Finney &quot;was the best judge of placer ground in Gold Canyon&quot;, locating the quartz footwall of the Ophir on 22 February 1858, the placers on Little Gold Hill on 28 January 1859, and the placers below Ophir in 1857.

After the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859, the town developed seemingly overnight on the eastern slopes of Mount Davidson, perched at a 6200-foot elevation. Below the town were dug intricate tunnels and shafts for silver mining. The Comstock Lode discovery and subsequent growth of Virginia City was unequaled by the history of other precious metal discoveries.

Virginia City&#x27;s silver ore discoveries were not part of the California Gold Rush, which occurred 10 years before. At the time of the discovery of the Comstock Lode, silver was considered the monetary equal of gold, and all production was purchased by the federal government for use in coinage. In 1873, silver was demonetized by the government, in large part due to the flood of silver into international markets from the silver mines of Virginia City.
Technical problems plagued the early mining efforts, requiring the development of new mining technology to support the challenge. German engineer Philip Deidesheimer created a timbering system for mining tunnels called square sets, which enabled the retrieval of huge amounts of silver ore in a safe manner. Square set timbering, roots blowers, stamp mills, the Washoe Pan milling process, Cornish pumps, Burleigh machine drills, wire woven rope, miners&#x27; safety cages and the safety clutch for those cages; even the Sutro tunnel all had a place in supporting the exploitation of the rich ore body. As technological advancements, these were used many times over in later mining applications. In 1876 one observer reported that in Virginia City, &quot;every activity has to do with the mining, transportation, or reduction of silver ore, or the melting and assaying of silver bullion.&quot;

By 1876, Nevada produced over half of all the precious metals in the United States. The Comstock produced silver and gold ore valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. The wealth supported the Northern cause during the American Civil War and flooded the world monetary markets, resulting in economic changes.

Like many cities and towns in Nevada, Virginia City was a mining boomtown; it developed virtually overnight as a result of miners rushing to the Comstock Lode silver strike of 1859. But, Virginia City far surpassed all others for its peak of population, technological advancements developed there, and for providing the population base upon which Nevada qualified for statehood. The riches of the Comstock Lode inspired men to hunt for silver mines throughout Nevada and other parts of the American West.

Virginia City population increased from 4,000 in 1862 to over 15,000 in 1863. It fluctuated depending on mining output. US Census figures do not reflect all of these frequent changes. Nonetheless, Virginia City overnight became one of the largest cities in the American Southwest. For the 1880 United States census, Virginia City was even larger than some of today&#x27;s largest cities of the entire US, such as Phoenix, San Diego, Jacksonville, and even Dallas. The city included gas and sewer lines, the one hundred room International Hotel with elevator, three theatres, the Maguire Opera House, four churches, and three daily newspapers. Many of the homes and buildings were made of brick.

With this center of wealth, many important local politicians and businessmen came from the mining camp. At its peak after the Big Bonanza of 1873 Virginia City had a population of over 25,000 residents and was called the richest city in the United States. Dominated by San Francisco moneyed interests, Virginia City was heralded as the sophisticated interior partner of San Francisco. &quot;San Francisco on the coast and Virginia City inland&quot; became the mantra of west coast Victorian entrepreneurs. Early Virginia City settlers were in large part the backwash from San Francisco and the California Gold Rush, ten years before. Mine owners who made a killing in the Comstock mines spent most of their wealth in San Francisco.

A San Francisco stock market existed for the exploitation of Comstock mining. The Bank of California financed building the financial district of San Francisco with money from the Comstock mines. The influence of the Comstock lode rejuvenated what was the ragged little town of 1860 San Francisco. &quot;Nearly all the profits of the Comstock were invested in San Francisco real estate and in the erection of fine buildings.&quot; Thus, Virginia City built San Francisco. The Comstock&#x27;s success, measured in values of the time period, totaled &quot;about $400 million&quot;. Mining and its attraction of population was the economic factor that caused the separation of Nevada territory from Utah, and later justified and supported Nevada statehood.
The mining industry dominated Virginia City, making it an industrial center similar to those of the east coast. But the city retained some of its frontier flavor. The social history of the town has emphasized the high number of immigrants among its residents. Miners largely from Cornwall, England, where tin mines had been developed based on hard rock technology, flooded the Comstock. The new English immigrants were one of the largest ethnic groups. Many of the miners who came to the city were Cornish or Irish. In 1870, Asians were 7.6% of the population, primarily Chinese workers who settled in many western towns after they had completed construction of the transcontinental railroad. The Chinese filled niche markets, such as laundry workers and cooks.

Through time, the numerous independent Comstock mines became consolidated under ownership of large monopolies. A group called the Bank Crowd, dominated by William Sharon in Virginia City and William Ralston in San Francisco, financed the mines and mills of the Comstock until they had a virtual monopoly. By manipulating stock through rumors and false reports of mining wealth, some men made fortunes from the stocks of Virginia City&#x27;s mines. When it appeared the Comstock Lode was finished, the city&#x27;s population declined sharply, with ten thousand leaving in 1864 and 1865.

By the late 1860s, a group of Irish investors threatened the Bank Crowd&#x27;s control. John Mackay and partner James Fair began as common miners, working their way up to management positions in the mines. By purchasing stock in the mines, they realized financial independence. Their partners James Clair Flood and William S. O&#x27;Brien stayed in San Francisco and speculated in stock. The Irish Big Four (or Bonanza Kings), as the men were called, eventually controlled the Consolidated Virginia mine where the Big Bonanza was discovered in 1873. The next few years were some of the most profitable on the Comstock, as the Bank Crowd lost control to the Irish Big Four. Population reached 25,000 in 1875.

Mining operations were hindered by the extreme temperatures in the mines caused by natural hot springs. In winter the miners would snowshoe to the mines and then have to descend to work in high temperatures. These harsh conditions contributed to a low life expectancy, and earned miners the nickname of Hot Water Plugs. Adolph Sutro built the Sutro Tunnel to drain the hot spring waters to the valley below. But, by the time it was completed in 1879, the mines had substantially passed the intersection level, as their tunnels had been dug ever deeper. In 1879, the mines began to play out and the population fell to just under 11,000.

===Great Fire of 1875===
Between 1859 and 1875, Virginia City had numerous serious fires. The October 26, 1875, fire, dubbed the Great Fire, caused $12 million in damage. &quot;The spectacle beggars description; the world was on fire...a square mile of roaring flames.&quot; When a church caught fire, Mackay was heard to say, &quot;Damn the church! We can build another if we can keep the fire from going down these shafts.&quot; Though the Con. Virginia and Ophir hoisting works burned, the fire did not penetrate the Con. Virginia shaft and only reached 400 feet into the Ophir shaft. &quot;Railroad car wheels were melted&quot;, &quot;brick buildings went down like paper boxes&quot;, and two thousand were left homeless.

In ensuing months the city was rebuilt. A majority of the area now designated as the National Historic Landmark historic district dates to this later time period. However, the bonanza period was at an end by 1880.

===Virginia City and Mark Twain===

The writer and humorist Samuel Clemens, then a reporter on the local &quot;Territorial Enterprise&quot; newspaper first used the pen name Mark Twain in Virginia City in February 1863 Clemens lived in Virginia City and wrote for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from fall 1862 until May 1864. His departure was to avoid a duel with a local newspaper editor upset over Clemens&#x27; reporting. Clemens returned to the Comstock region twice on lecture tours, first in 1866 when he was mugged on the Divide. The muggers relieved Clemens of his watch and his money. The robbery turns out to have been a practical joke played on Clemens by his friends. He did not appreciate the joke, but he did retrieve his belongings—particularly his gold watch (worth $300), which had great sentimental value. Clemens&#x27; book &quot;Roughing It&quot; (1872) includes this and other anecdotes about the city. Clemens&#x27; second return occurred in 1868 at the time of the hanging of John Millian, who was convicted of murdering the well-liked madam Julia Bulette.

==Climate==

The event was put on first by &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; and the Aston Martin Club, the following year the SCCA took the same route, and later it was picked up by the Ferrari Owners Club. Highway 342 is now the return route for cars that have completed their runs up Highway 341. The hillclimb covers , climbing and passing through 21 corners.

The portion of line that has been rebuilt so far stretches south to Carson City and through Gold Hill. The project ran the first steam engine from Carson City on September 5, 2009, and continues to provide tourist excursions between Carson City and Virginia City on weekends.

<text>L&#x27;Enfant Plaza station is an intermodal transit station complex located at L&#x27;Enfant Plaza in the Southwest Federal Center neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It consists of an underground Washington Metro rapid transit station and an elevated Virginia Railway Express commuter rail station.

The Metro station, which opened on July 1, 1977, is one of four major interchange stations on the Metro system. It is the only station to serve five of the six Metro lines: the Green and Yellow lines with two side platforms on the upper level, and the Blue, Orange, and Silver lines with one island platform on the lower level. It was the seventh-busiest Metro stop in 2023, with an average of 7,506 daily passenger entries.

The VRE station, which has a single side platform serving the northernmost of the three tracks of the RF&amp;P Subdivision, is served by the Manassas Line and Fredericksburg Line.

== Station layout ==

The station complex is located in the Southwest Federal Center area of Southwest, Washington, DC, centered around the intersection of 7th Street SW and D Street SW. The Metro station has three levels: a fare mezzanine, the Yellow/Green Line upper level with two side platforms, and the Orange/Blue/Silver Line lower level with one island platform. The north-south upper level stretches from C Street to E Street; the east-west lower level stretches from 9th Street to 6th Street. Metro entrances are located at the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza shopping mall concourse at 9th and D Streets, on D Street between 6th and 7th Streets, and at Maryland Avenue and 7th Street. Additional head houses may be eventually added.

The VRE platform is located on the north side of the three-track RF&amp;P Subdivision, which is elevated above Virginia Avenue SW between 6th Street and 7th Street. Stairs lead to the station from 6th Street and 7th Street; a ramp leads to the station from C Street west of 7th Street. Most Amtrak intercity trains do not stop at L&#x27;Enfant, though several &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; trains stop for VRE passengers only as part of a ticket cross-honoring agreement.
==History==
===Metro station===
The lower level of the Metro station opened on July 1, 1977, as part of the opening of of the Blue Line between and . Orange Line service began on November 20, 1978 when the extension to opened. The upper level opened with the opening of the Yellow Line on April 30, 1983; Green Line service began on May 11, 1991. Silver Line service on the lower level began on July 26, 2014. The Maryland Avenue entrance will be closed for about seven months beginning on May 9, 2022, for escalator replacement.

L&#x27;Enfant Plaza was the setting of a 2007 Pulitzer Prize–winning article by &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Gene Weingarten where world-famous classical violinist Joshua Bell performed outside the station at rush hour disguised as a street musician. On January 12, 2015, smoke appeared in the station during the afternoon rush hour, causing one death. A scene from the 2020 film &quot;Wonder Woman 1984&quot; was filmed in the station in June 2018.

===VRE station===

Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad local service used a station at 7th Street until at least the mid-1950s. Virginia Railway Express (VRE) built a new station in the early 1990s. Manassas Line service began on June 22, 1992, followed by Fredericksburg Line service on July 20. L&#x27;Enfant is the northern terminus of 40% of trips on VRE. A 2010 city report analyzed options to expand the station, including the potential extension of MARC service from Union Station to L&#x27;Enfant or Alexandria. VRE began planning for an expansion of the station in 2021. The existing side platform will be replaced with an island platform to allow for increased service, with a fourth track added.

<text>The Money or the Gun was an Australian comedy/talk-show on the ABC network. It ran from late 1989 to mid-1990, with occasional specials until 1994. It was written by Andrew Denton, Simon Dodd, Bruce Griffiths, and George Dodd, directed by Martin Coombes and produced by Mark Fitzgerald.

Each episode was based on a significant theme, with Denton interviewing a number of people as well as conducting vox pops on the street. Significant episodes include &quot;Guns-The Musical&quot; and the award-winning episode on disabilities, &quot;The Year of the Patronising Bastard&quot; (which picked up a United Nations Media Peace Prize). In 1993, a one-off special was called &quot;Topic of Cancer&quot;, which talked to teenagers with cancer (while at a CanTeen weekend). In 2003, Denton held a 10-year reunion for the people on the 1993 show, as part of his ABC interview programme &quot;Enough Rope&quot;.

==&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;==
Each week a guest would perform their own version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Versions would occasionally tie in with the theme of the episode (&quot;Guns - the Musical&quot; had a Broadway-style version by Jodie Gilles as the conclusion, while the episode on Australian Comedy had the Doug Anthony All Stars performing it with the assistance of Barry Crocker) but the most surprising of all was the version by Rolf Harris which eventually reached number 7 on the UK singles chart. Generally the performance of &quot;Stairway&quot; would be a break in the program and the artists would have no other part in the program. The CD release won an Aria Award in Australia in 1993 and was subsequently released on the Atlantic Label in the USA though truncated.

Performers and styles included:
* Kate Ceberano and The Ministry Of Fun, in a funk style
* John Paul Young, in the style of &quot;Love is in the Air&quot;
* Pardon Me Boys, in a swing style (with numerous references to Glenn Miller songs)
* The Beatnix, a Beatles tribute band, in the style of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;
* Nick Barker &amp; The Reptiles, in a heavy blues style
* Rolf Harris, in the style of &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport&quot;
* The Australian Doors Show, a Doors tribute band, in the style of &quot;When the Music&#x27;s Over&quot;
* Sandra Hahn, Michael Turkic and the Opera Australia chorus, in the style of an epic Wagner opera
* Robyne Dunn, in the style of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; by The Beatles
* Elvis impersonator Neil Pepper, in the style of &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;
* Toots - Jenny Lovell in the flesh, voice by Helen Jones, a femme fatale performance in the style of Jessica Rabbit
* The Whipper Snappers, in an indie rock girl group style
* Friends Of The Castanet Club, as a sea shanty
* Toys Went Berserk, a post-punk version
* Bob Downe, in the style of a lounge singer
* The Rock Lobsters, a B-52&#x27;s tribute band, in the style of &quot;Rock Lobster&quot;
* Jodie Gillies, in the style of a Broadway musical (with numerous references to &quot;One&quot; from &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;)
* Etcetera Theatre Company, as a techno dance in the style of Talking Heads
* The Jeff Duff Orchestra, a chamber orchestra with vocals
* Fargone Beauties, as a country thrash in the style of &quot;Dueling Banjos&quot;
* Judi Connelli, as a gospel song
* Barry Crocker and Doug Anthony All Stars in a unique style
* Vegemite Reggae, in a modern reggae/ska style
* The Symphony Chorus of the Sydney Philharmonia Choirs, as an a cappella chorus
* Leonard Teale, as a dramatic poem
* Rory O&#x27;Donoghue in the style of an advertising jingle and an Australian ballad

Two compilations of the performances were released in 1992: a video which featured 25 of the 26 performances, and an album, called &quot;Stairways to Heaven&quot;, which featured 22 of the 26 performances. An album consisting of 12 tracks was released internationally in 1995.

<doc id="664068" wikidata="Q1258035" url="?curid=664068" title="Three-point hitch">
<text>The three-point hitch (British English: three-point linkage) is a widely used type of hitch for attaching ploughs and other implements to an agricultural or industrial tractor. The three points resemble either a triangle, or the letter A. In engineering terms, three-point attachment is the simplest and the only statically determinate way of rigidly joining two bodies.

A three-point hitch attaches the implement to the tractor so that the orientation of the implement is fixed with respect to the tractor and the arm position of the hitch. The tractor carries some or all of the weight of the implement. The other main mechanism for attaching a load is through a drawbar, a single point, pivoting attachment where the implement or trailer is not in a fixed position with respect to the tractor.

The primary benefit of the three-point hitch system is to transfer the weight and resistance of an implement to the drive wheels of the tractor. This gives the tractor more usable traction than it would otherwise have, given the same power, weight, and fuel consumption. For example, when the Ford 9N introduced Harry Ferguson&#x27;s three-point hitch design to American production-model tractors in 1939, it was a light and affordable tractor competing principally with row-crop tractors such as Farmalls that did not yet have three-point hitches. At , the 9N could plow more than in a normal day pulling two plows, outperforming the tractive performance of the heavier and more expensive Farmall F-30 model. The hitch&#x27;s utility and simplicity have since made it an industry standard.

==Components==

The three-point hitch is made up of several components working together. These include the tractor&#x27;s hydraulic system, attaching points, the lifting arms, and stabilizers.

Three-point hitches are composed of three movable arms. The two lower arms—the hitch lifting arms—are controlled by the hydraulic system, and provide lifting, lowering, and even tilting to the arms. The upper center arm—called the top link—is movable, but is usually not powered by the tractor&#x27;s hydraulic system. Each arm has an attachment device to connect implements to the hitch.

Each hitch has attachment holes for attaching implements, and the implement has posts that fit through the holes. The implement is secured by placing a pin on the ends of the posts.

The hitch lifting arms are powered by the tractor&#x27;s own hydraulic system. The hydraulic system is controlled by the operator, and usually a variety of settings are available. A draft control mechanism is often present in modern three-point hitch systems. The draft of the implement, the amount of force it is taking to pull the implement, is sensed on the top link and the hydraulic system automatically raises the arms slightly when the draft increases and lowers the arms when the draft decreases.

==Size categories==
There are five different hitch sizes, called categories. The higher category hitches have sturdier lift arms and larger connector pins.

There are also variants to the above categories denoted by N (narrow). These utilize the pin sizes of the listed category, but the width of a category one step lower. The N variations are common in &quot;quick hitches&quot; and allow larger tractors to easily hook onto smaller utility implements.

==History==
Before the 1940s, most hitching of farm implements to tractors was done simply with a drawbar, on the same principle as a modern tow hitch. The drawbar was a flat bar with holes in it, and the implements were trailers, with tongues that attached to the drawbar with a pin through a hole. The main reason why this was the default hitching idea is that it was the natural follow-on from the days of horse-drawn implements, which were towed as trailers by the horse or team (and often had an operator&#x27;s seat). In fact, for decades during the mechanisation of agriculture in Europe and North America, as tractors gradually replaced horses in increasing degrees, existing implements from the horse era were often what the tractor pulled. Towing with a drawbar is a good, practical system for many purposes, and it has continued to be used even up to today, but the three-point hitch outperforms it in several ways (described below). 

Harry Ferguson patented the three-point linkage for agricultural tractors in Britain in 1926. He had long been a champion of the importance of rigid attachment of the plough to the tractor. The idea did not originate with him, but he led its popularization over many years of development, explaining, and selling. During the decade of 1916 to 1926 he developed his ideas through various iterations, duplex and triplex, mechanical and hydraulic, to arrive at the patented form. During the next decade, he continued explaining and selling his hitches and implements and even produced his own model of tractor in cooperation with David Brown Ltd. via the Ferguson-Brown Company. The particular geometry of the linkage that attached the plough to the tractor enabled forces generated by the plough to be applied to the rear wheels of the tractor. This redirected the plough&#x27;s resistance into downward force on the drive wheels, which enabled Ferguson&#x27;s tractor to be much lighter and more manoeuvrable than earlier models of farm tractor with equivalent tractive force and traction. As a result his tractor could operate on soft ground and caused less compacting damage to the soil in comparison with other tractors of the time, and it could produce given amounts of work with less time and fuel. The hydraulically operated and controlled three-point hitch used the draft of the mounted tool to moderate the depth of the tool and therefore the load on the tractor (automatic depth control or draft control). In addition, the three-point hitch would prevent the tractor from flipping backwards on the drive wheels if the implement being dragged were to hit a rock or other immovable obstruction. Ferguson and his colleagues developed several innovations to this device (e.g., the hydraulic lift and depth control) which made the system workable, effective, and desirable. In 1938, after almost two decades of trying to sell Henry Ford on using Ferguson&#x27;s system on tractors mass-produced by Ford, Ferguson finally convinced Ford. The American mass-market debut was via the Ford-Ferguson 9N in 1939. 

The Ferguson system, as it was called, was not just an improved hitch but rather the hitch plus an entire line of implements purpose-built to make full use of its advantages. During the 1940s, it was so advantageous and popular that other manufacturers were compelled to come up with competing hitch improvements that could also be pitched as proprietary &quot;systems&quot; with at least some of the features of the Ferguson system (such as quick, easy hitching and unhitching, implement raising and lowering controlled from the tractor seat, and treating the tractor and implement as a unit rather than an articulated pair). Thus, International Harvester developed its Fast Hitch and began to advertise the notion of &quot;farming with the Farmall system&quot; and Allis-Chalmers introduced its Snap-Coupler which allowed the operator to hook and unhook implements without leaving the operator&#x27;s seat. Likewise, JI Case developed its Eagle Hitch, and similar path was followed at John Deere. Some of these systems, with one-point or two-point hitching, were not well suited to lifting heavy implements. They also presented the problem of incompatibility between brands of tractors and implements, applying pressure toward vendor lock-in that many farmers resented. During the 1950s and 1960s, farmers often would have to purchase the same brand implements as their tractor to be able to hook up the implement correctly or to best effect. If a farmer needed to use a different brand of implement, an adaptation kit—which were typically clumsy, ill-fitting, or unsafe—was sometimes needed. The pressure toward vendor lock-in was a two-edged blade for the salespeople. It was an advantage in cases where it encouraged the sale of implements (e.g., a farmer decided to purchase not just a tractor but also new implements to replace his old ones, betting on increased productivity to make it worth the cost), but it was a disadvantage to the extent that farmers did not see the value in a special new hitch if they could not afford also to buy new implements to make full use of it or felt uneasy about buying new implements when they already had existing implements that were still usable. Ferguson often faced the latter problem in the UK and Ireland in the 1920s and 1930s, and it also applied to the competitors&#x27; proprietary hitches of the 1940s and 1950s.

In the 1960s, as patents on the technology expired, tractor and implement manufacturers agreed on the three-point hitch as the one standard, interchangeable, full-featured system to hitch implements to tractors. With the advent of nonproprietary status, the manufacturers were able to refine the system and create useful modifications. Now, nearly all manufacturers have adopted some standardised form of the modern three-point hitch system; many companies also offer safe adaptation kits for converting the non-standard hitch systems to the three-point hitch system.

<text>Nicolas Camille Flammarion FRAS (; 26 February 1842 – 3 June 1925) was a French astronomer and author. He was a prolific author of more than fifty titles, including popular science works about astronomy, several notable early science fiction novels, and works on psychical research and related topics. He also published the magazine &quot;L&#x27;Astronomie&quot;, starting in 1882. He maintained a private observatory at Juvisy-sur-Orge, France.

==Biography==

Camille Flammarion was born in Montigny-le-Roi, Haute-Marne, France. He was the brother of Ernest Flammarion (1846–1936), the founder of the Groupe Flammarion publishing house. In 1858 he became a professional at computery at the Paris Observatory. He was a founder and the first president of the &quot;Société astronomique de France&quot;, which originally had its own independent journal, &quot;BSAF&quot; (&quot;Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France&quot;), which was first published in 1887. In January 1895, after 13 volumes of &quot;L&#x27;Astronomie&quot; and 8 of &quot;BSAF&quot;, the two merged, making &quot;L’Astronomie&quot; its bulletin. The 1895 volume of the combined journal was numbered 9, to preserve the &quot;BSAF&quot; volume numbering, but this had the consequence that volumes 9 to 13 of &quot;L&#x27;Astronomie&quot; can each refer to two different publications five years apart.

The &quot;Flammarion engraving&quot; first appeared in Flammarion&#x27;s 1888 edition of &quot;L’Atmosphère&quot;. In 1907, he wrote that he believed that dwellers on Mars had tried to communicate with Earth in the past. He also believed in 1907 that a seven-tailed comet was heading toward Earth. In 1910, for the appearance of Halley&#x27;s Comet, he was widely but falsely reported as believing the gas from the comet&#x27;s tail &quot;would impregnate [the Earth’s] atmosphere and possibly snuff out all life on the planet&quot;.

As a young man, Flammarion was exposed to two significant social movements in the western world: the thoughts and ideas of Darwin and Lamarck and the rising popularity of spiritism with spiritualist churches and organizations appearing all over Europe. He has been described as an &quot;astronomer, mystic and storyteller&quot; who was &quot;obsessed by life after death, and on other worlds, and [who] seemed to see no distinction between the two&quot;.

He was influenced by Jean Reynaud (1806–1863) and his &quot;Terre et ciel&quot; (1854), which described a religious system based on the transmigration of souls believed to be reconcilable with both Christianity and pluralism. He was convinced that souls after the physical death pass from planet to planet and progressively improve at each new incarnation. In 1862 he published his first book, &quot;The Plurality of Inhabited Worlds&quot;, and was dismissed from his position at the Paris Observatory later the same year. It is not quite clear if these two incidents are related to each other.

In &quot;Real and Imaginary Worlds&quot; (1864) and &quot;Lumen&quot; (1887), he &quot;describes a range of exotic species, including sentient plants which combine the processes of digestion and respiration. This belief in extraterrestrial life, Flammarion combined with a religious conviction derived, not from the Catholic faith upon which he had been raised, but from the writings of Jean Reynaud and their emphasis upon the transmigration of souls. Man he considered to be a “citizen of the sky,” other worlds “studios of human work, schools where the expanding soul progressively learns and develops, assimilating gradually the knowledge to which its aspirations tend, approaching thus evermore the end of its destiny.”

His psychical studies also influenced some of his science fiction, where he would write about his beliefs in a cosmic version of metempsychosis. In &quot;Lumen&quot;, a human character meets the soul of an alien, able to cross the universe faster than light, that has been reincarnated on many different worlds, each with its own gallery of organisms and their evolutionary history. Other than that, his writing about other worlds adhered fairly closely to then current ideas in evolutionary theory and astronomy. Among other things, he believed that all planets went through more or less the same stages of development, but at different rates depending on their sizes.

The fusion of science, science fiction and the spiritual influenced other readers as well; &quot;With great commercial success he blended scientific speculation with science fiction to propagate modern myths such as the notion that “superior” extraterrestrial species reside on numerous planets, and that the human soul evolves through cosmic reincarnation. Flammarion&#x27;s influence was great, not just on the popular thought of his day, but also on later writers with similar interests and convictions.&quot; In the English translation of &quot;Lumen&quot;, Brian Stableford argues that both Olaf Stapledon and William Hope Hodgson have likely been influenced by Flammarion. Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Poison Belt&quot;, published 1913, also has a lot in common with Flammarion&#x27;s supposed worries that the tail of Halley&#x27;s Comet would be poisonous for earth life. Edgar Rice Burroughs makes a direct reference to Flammarion in Skeleton Men of Jupiter.

==Family==
Camille was a brother of Ernest Flammarion and Berthe Martin-Flammarion, and uncle of a woman named Zelinda. His first wife was Sylvie Petiaux-Hugo Flammarion, and his second wife was Gabrielle Renaudot Flammarion, also a noted astronomer.

==Mars==
Beginning with Giovanni Schiaparelli&#x27;s 1877 observations, 19th-century astronomers observing Mars believed they saw a network of lines on its surface, which were named &quot;canals&quot; by Schiaparelli. These turned out to be an optical illusion due to the limited observing instruments of the time, as revealed by better telescopes in the 1920s. Camille, a contemporary of Schiaparelli, extensively researched the so-called &quot;canals&quot; during the 1880s and 1890s. As American astronomer Percival Lowell, he thought the &quot;canals&quot; were artificial in nature and most likely the &quot;rectification of old rivers aimed at the general distribution of water to the surface of the continents.&quot; He assumed the planet was in an advanced stage of its habitability, and the canals were the product of an intelligent species attempting to survive on a dying world. Flammarion also assumed the red color on the planet&#x27;s surface was either exposure of the interior of the soil, or because of red vegetation.

==Halley&#x27;s Comet==

When astronomers announced that the Earth would pass through the tail of Halley&#x27;s Comet in May 1910, Flammarion was widely reported, in numerous American newspapers, as believing that toxic gases in the tail might &quot;possibly snuff out all life on the planet&quot;.

In an article in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in November 1909, responding to such claims by others, he stated that &quot;The poisoning of humanity by deleterious gases is improbable&quot;, and correctly stated that the matter in the comet&#x27;s tail is so tenuous that it would have no noticeable effect. However, he also indulged in a &quot;thought experiment&quot; about what might happen if it &quot;did&quot; inject various gases into the atmosphere. Sensation-seeking papers chose to quote only the latter part, leading to the widespread misconception that Flammarion actually believed it.

On 1 February 1910, Flammarion published an update in the &quot;Herald&quot;, saying he wished to warn journalists against &quot;accusing me of announcing the end of the world for May 19 next. The end of the world will not occur on May 19 next.&quot;

==Psychical research==

Flammarion approached spiritism, psychical research and reincarnation from the viewpoint of the scientific method, writing, &quot;It is by the scientific method alone that we may make progress in the search for truth. Religious belief must not take the place of impartial analysis. We must be constantly on our guard against illusions.&quot; He was very close to the French author Allan Kardec, who founded Spiritism.

Flammarion had studied mediumship and wrote, &quot;It is infinitely to be regretted that we cannot trust the loyalty of mediums. They almost always cheat&quot;. However, Flammarion, a believer in psychic phenomena, attended séances with Eusapia Palladino and claimed that some of her phenomena were genuine. He produced in his book alleged levitation photographs of a table and an impression of a face in putty. Joseph McCabe did not find the evidence convincing. He noted that the impressions of faces in putty were always of Palladino&#x27;s face and could have easily been made, and she was not entirely clear from the table in the levitation photographs.

His book &quot;The Unknown&quot; (1900) received a negative review from the psychologist Joseph Jastrow who wrote &quot;the work&#x27;s fundamental faults are a lack of critical judgment in the estimation of evidence, and of an appreciation of the nature of the logical conditions which the study of these problems presents.&quot;

After two years investigation into automatic writing he wrote that the subconscious mind is the explanation and there is no evidence for the spirit hypothesis. Flammarion believed in the survival of the soul after death but wrote that mediumship had not been scientifically proven. Even though Flammarion believed in the survival of the soul after death he did not believe in the spirit hypothesis of Spiritism, instead he believed that Spiritist activities such as ectoplasm and levitations of objects could be explained by an unknown &quot;psychic force&quot; from the medium. He also believed that telepathy could explain some paranormal phenomena.

In his book &quot;Mysterious Psychic Forces&quot; (1909) he wrote:

In the 1920s Flammarion changed some of his beliefs on apparitions and hauntings but still claimed there was no evidence for the spirit hypothesis of mediumship in Spiritism. In his 1924 book &quot;Les maisons hantées&quot; (Haunted Houses) he came to the conclusion that in some rare cases hauntings are caused by departed souls whilst others are caused by the &quot;remote action of the psychic force of a living person&quot;. The book was reviewed by the magician Harry Houdini who wrote it &quot;fails to supply adequate proof of the veracity of the conglomeration of hearsay it contains; it must, therefore, be a collection of myths.&quot;

In a presidential address to the Society for Psychical Research in October 1923 Flammarion summarized his views after 60 years of investigating paranormal phenomena. He wrote that he believed in telepathy, etheric doubles, the stone tape theory and &quot;exceptionally and rarely the dead do manifest&quot; in hauntings. 
He was also a member of the Theosophical Society.

==Legacy==
He was the first to suggest the names Triton and Amalthea for moons of Neptune and Jupiter, respectively, although these names were not officially adopted until many decades later. George Gamow cited Flammarion as having had a significant influence on his childhood interest in science.

<text>This is a list of [[nuclear weapon]]s listed according to country of origin, and then by type within the states. The United States, Russia, China and India are known to possess a nuclear triad, being capable to deliver nuclear weapons by land, sea and air.
==United States==
American nuclear weapons of all types – bombs, warheads, shells, and others – are numbered in the same sequence starting with the Mark 1 and () ending with the W91 (which was cancelled prior to introduction into service). All designs which were formally intended to be weapons at some point received a number designation. Pure test units which were experiments (and not intended to be weapons) are not numbered in this sequence.

Early weapons were very large and could only be used as free fall bombs. These were known by &quot;Mark&quot; designators, like the Mark 4 which was a development of the Fat Man weapon. As weapons became more sophisticated they also became much smaller and lighter, allowing them to be used in many roles. At this time the weapons began to receive designations based on their role; bombs were given the prefix &quot;B&quot;, while the same warhead used in other roles, like missiles, would normally be prefixed &quot;W&quot;. For instance, the W-53 warhead was also used as the basis for the B53 nuclear bomb. Such examples share the same sequence number.

In other cases, when the modifications are more significant, variants are assigned their own number. An example is the B61 nuclear bomb, which was the parent design for the W80, W81, and W84. There are also examples of out-of-sequence numbering and other prefixes used in special occasions.

This list includes weapons which were developed to the point of being assigned a model number (and in many cases, prototypes were test fired), but which were then cancelled prior to introduction into military service. Those models are listed as cancelled, along with the year or date of cancellation of their program.

* Bombs – designated with Mark (&quot;Mk&quot;) numbers until 1968, and with &quot;B&quot; numbers after that. &quot;Test Experimental&quot; bombs designated with &quot;TX&quot;.

===Common nuclear primaries===

Several American weapons designs share common components. These include publicly identified models listed below.
==Soviet Union/Russia==

At the peak of its arsenal in 1988, Russia possessed around 45,000 nuclear weapons in its stockpile, roughly 13,000 more than the United States arsenal, the second largest in the world, which peaked in 1966.
*Tests
*Torpedoes
**53-58 torpedo with 10 kilotons RDS-9 warhead
**65-73 torpedo with 20 kilotons 
**VA-111 Shkval with 150 kilotons
*Bombs
**RDS-1, 22 kiloton bomb. Tested 29 August 1949 as &quot;First Light&quot; (Joe 1). Total of 5 stockpiled
**RDS-2, 38 kiloton bomb. Tested 24 September 1951 as &quot;Second Light.&quot; The RDS-2 was an entirely Russian design, delayed by development of the RDS-1
**RDS-3, 42 kiloton bomb. First Soviet bomb tested in an airdrop on 18 October 1951. First &#x27;mass-produced&quot; Soviet bomb
**RDS-3I, 62 kiloton bomb. Tested 24 October 1954. The RDS-31 was an improved RDS-3 with external neutron generator

==India==

Although India&#x27;s nuclear programme and its details are highly classified, international figures suggest that India possesses about 172 nuclear weapons as per 2024 estimate. In 1999, India was estimated to have 800 kg of separated reactor-grade plutonium, with a total amount of 8,300 kg of civilian plutonium, enough for approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons.

==Israel==
Israel is widely believed to possess a substantial arsenal of nuclear weapons and missiles, estimated at 75–130 and 100–200 warheads, but refuses officially to confirm or deny whether it has a nuclear weapon program, leaving the details of any such weapons unclear. Mordechai Vanunu, a former nuclear technician for Israel, confirmed the existence of a nuclear weapons program in 1986.

Unconfirmed rumors have hinted at tactical nuclear artillery shells, light fission bombs and missile warheads, and perhaps thermonuclear missile warheads.

The BBC News Online website published an article on 28 May 2008, which quotes former U.S. President Jimmy Carter as stating that Israel has at least 150 nuclear weapons. The article continues to state that this is the second confirmation of Israel&#x27;s nuclear capability by a U.S. spokesman following comments from U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates at a Senate hearing and had apparently been confirmed a short time later by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.

==Pakistan==

As of 2024, Pakistan is believed to possess about 170 nuclear weapon devices and the specifications of these weapon systems and their productions are highly classified. The main series for nuclear transportation is Hatf (lit. &quot;Target&quot;).

==North Korea==
North Korea claims to possess nuclear weapons, however, the specifications of its systems are not public. It is estimated to have 6–18 low yield nuclear weapons (August 2012 estimate). On 9 October 2006, North Korea achieved its first nuclear detonation.

On 25 May 2009, North Korea conducted a second test of nuclear weapons at the same location as the original test. The test weapon was of the same magnitude as the atomic bombs dropped on Japan in the 2nd World War. At the same time of the test, North Korea tested two short range ballistic missiles. The country tested a 7 kt nuclear weapon on 2 February 2013. On 3 September 2017, North Korea conducted an underground thermonuclear test which had an estimated yield of 100kt to 250kt, according to various sources.

On March 24, 2023, North Korea unveiled the tactical nuclear bomb with at least 10 warheads shown, each measuring an estimated 40 to 50 centimeters in diameter and 1 meter in length as reported by the South Korean media. Hwasong-11A (KN-23) and KN-25 ballistic missiles are capable of carrying it.

==South Africa==

South Africa built six or seven gun-type weapons. All constructed weapons were verified by International Atomic Energy Agency and other international observers to have been dismantled, along with the complete weapons program, and their highly enriched uranium was reprocessed back into low enriched form unsuitable for weapons.

<text>Richard Walden Yates (February 3, 1926 – November 7, 1992) was an American fiction writer identified with the mid-century &quot;Age of Anxiety.&quot; His first novel, &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, was a finalist for the 1962 National Book Award, while his first short story collection, &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot;, brought comparisons to James Joyce. Critical acclaim for his writing, however, was not reflected in commercial success during his lifetime.

Interest in Yates has revived somewhat since his death, partly because of an influential 1999 essay by Stewart O&#x27;Nan in the &quot;Boston Review&quot;, a 2003 biography by Blake Bailey and the 2008 Academy Award-nominated and Golden Globe-winning film &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.

==Life and career==
Yates was born in Yonkers, New York, the son of Vincent Yates and Ruth Walden Maurer. He came from an unstable home; his parents divorced when he was three and much of his childhood was spent in many different towns and residences. He first became interested in journalism and writing while attending Avon Old Farms School in Avon, Connecticut. After leaving Avon, Yates joined the Army, serving in France and Germany during World War II. By the middle of 1946, he was back in New York.

Upon his return to New York City, he worked as a journalist, freelance ghost writer (briefly writing speeches for Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy) and publicity writer for Remington Rand Corporation. His career as a novelist began in 1961 with the publication of the well received &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;. In 1962, he wrote the screenplay for a film adaptation of William Styron&#x27;s &quot;Lie Down in Darkness&quot;, which has not yet been produced as of 2022. He subsequently taught writing at Columbia University, the New School for Social Research, Boston University (where his papers are archived), at the University of Iowa Writer&#x27;s Workshop, at Wichita State University, the University of Southern California Master of Professional Writing Program, and at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.

In 1948, he married Sheila Bryant, the daughter of Marjorie Gilhooley Bryant and British actor Charles Bryant, who lived with Broadway actress and silent-film star Alla Nazimova from 1912 to 1925 during the height of her wealth and fame. Richard and Sheila Yates had two daughters, Sharon and Monica, before divorcing in 1959. His daughter Monica dated comedian Larry David and was the inspiration for Elaine Benes on David&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. In 1968, Yates married Martha Speer and they had a daughter, Gina. A heavy smoker his entire life, in 1992 he died of emphysema and complications from minor surgery in Birmingham, Alabama.

==Novels==
Yates&#x27;s fiction was autobiographical in nature and his fiction included much of his own life. Yates was born in 1926, making him 16 in 1942, the same age as Phil Drake in &quot;Cold Spring Harbor&quot;; he was 17 in 1943, the same age as William Grove in &quot;A Good School&quot;; he was 18 in 1944, the same age as Robert Prentice in &quot;A Special Providence&quot;; he was 29 in 1955, the same age as Frank Wheeler in &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;; and he was 36 in 1962, one year younger than Emily Grimes in &quot;The Easter Parade&quot;. 
Yates&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, was a finalist for the National Book Award that year (alongside Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;, J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, and the winning novel, Walker Percy&#x27;s &quot;The Moviegoer&quot;). Yates was championed by writers as diverse as Kurt Vonnegut, Dorothy Parker, William Styron, Tennessee Williams and John Cheever. Yates&#x27;s brand of realism was a direct influence on writers including Andre Dubus, Raymond Carver and Richard Ford.

For much of his life, Yates&#x27;s work met almost universal critical acclaim, yet not one of his books sold over 12,000 copies in hardcover first edition. All of his novels were out of print in the years after his death, though his reputation has substantially increased posthumously and many of his novels have since been reissued in new editions. This current success can be largely traced to the influence of Stewart O&#x27;Nan&#x27;s 1999 essay in the &quot;Boston Review&quot;, &quot;The Lost World of Richard Yates: How the great writer of the Age of Anxiety disappeared from print&quot;.

With the revival of interest in Yates&#x27;s life and work after his death, Blake Bailey published the first in-depth biography of Yates, &quot;A Tragic Honesty: The Life and Work of Richard Yates&quot; (2003). Film director Sam Mendes directed &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;, a 2008 film based on the 1961 novel of the same name. The film was nominated for BAFTAs, Golden Globes, Academy Awards, and others. Kate Winslet thanked Yates for writing such a powerful novel and providing such a strong role for a woman while accepting a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her role in the film.

==Short fiction==
Yates was also an acclaimed author of short stories. &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot;, Yates&#x27;s first collection, followed the publication of his first novel, &quot;Revolutionary Road,&quot; by a single year. It was compared favorably to Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Dubliners&quot; (all but one of its stories take place in and around the boroughs of New York City rather than Joyce&#x27;s Dublin) and eventually achieved a kind of cult status among fiction writers despite its relative obscurity. One later &quot;New York Times&quot; essay by Robert Towers praised Yates&#x27;s &quot;exposure of the small fiercely defended dignities and much vaster humiliations of characters who might have been picked almost at random from the fat telephone book of the Borough of Queens.&quot;

Yates&#x27;s second collection, &quot;Liars in Love&quot;, appeared nearly 20 years later, in 1981, and was again met with a positive critical reception. Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, writing for the &quot;Times&quot;, called the stories &quot;wonderfully crafted&quot;, and concluded that &quot;every detail of this collection stays alive and fresh in one&#x27;s memory.&quot;

Despite this, only one of Yates&#x27;s short stories ever appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (after repeated rejections), and this was done posthumously. &quot;The Canal&quot; was published in the magazine nine years after the author&#x27;s death, to celebrate the 2001 release of &quot;The Collected Stories of Richard Yates,&quot; a collection that was again met with great critical fanfare.

==In popular culture==
Films
*In the movie &quot;Lonesome Jim&quot; (2005), the protagonist cites Yates as one of his favorite authors, adding that all Yates&#x27;s books were out of print by the time the author died.
*In Woody Allen&#x27;s film &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), Lee (Barbara Hershey) thanks Elliott (Michael Caine) for lending her &quot;The Easter Parade&quot;, which she says was great.

Novels 
*Nick Hornby&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;A Long Way Down&quot; features several suicidal characters; one of them carries a copy of &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot; so that it may be discovered on his corpse.
*Tao Lin&#x27;s 2010 novel is titled &quot;Richard Yates&quot;.
* Adelle Waldman&#x27;s 2013 novel &quot;The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P.&quot; was influenced by &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;.

Other 
*Singer Tanita Tikaram&#x27;s 1992 album title &quot;Eleven Kinds of Loneliness&quot; was borrowed from Yates&#x27;s 1962 collection of short stories.
*The character of Elaine Benes on TV series &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was loosely based on his daughter Monica, who had been the girlfriend and later friend of co-creator Larry David. David&#x27;s first meeting with the writer was the basis for &quot;The Jacket&quot; episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;″s second season, in which Jerry Seinfeld and George meet Elaine&#x27;s curmudgeonly novelist father, portrayed by Lawrence Tierney. The suede jacket incident depicted in that episode really did happen.

<doc id="664085" wikidata="Q457648" url="?curid=664085" title="Paula Newby-Fraser">
<text>Paula Newby-Fraser (born 2 June 1962 in Harare) is an Ironman triathlete and duathlete.

==Biography==
Newby-Fraser was born in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and raised in South Africa, where she was a nationally ranked swimmer as a child. She won the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii 8 times: 1986, 1988–1989, 1991–1994, and 1996. Because of her unprecedented winning streak, she is also referred to as &quot;The Queen of Kona&quot;.

Over 12 years, she won 21 of 26 Ironman races she entered around the globe, and dozens of shorter races as well.

Newby-Fraser won 24 Ironman races overall between 1986 and 2002. In the 1990s, she also competed in long distance duathlons like the PowerMan Zofingen in Switzerland and the 1990 World Duathon Championships in Palm Springs, USA. She defeated Liz Downing.

Among numerous other awards, the United States Sports Academy named her as one of the top five professional women athletes of the last 25 years (1972–1997). Paula Newby-Fraser held the Ironman Women&#x27;s world record of 8:50:28, until 2008-07-13, when Yvonne van Vlerken of the Netherlands posted a time of 8:45:48. Newby-Fraser is regarded as an icon for the Ironman distance in triathlon.

In 1991, Newby-Fraser appeared with the cycling master John Howard, in &quot;John Howard&#x27;s Lessons In Cycling&quot; video produced by New &amp; Unique Videos of San Diego, California. Newby-Fraser demonstrated the cycling technique called &quot;The Hot Stop&quot;. 
Later in her career, Newby-Fraser began running ultramarathons, which are running races of 50 km or more. At the Ridgecrest High Desert 50k in April 1997, she won with a new course record of 4 hours and 6 minutes.

<doc id="664088" wikidata="Q4929038" url="?curid=664088" title="Blue Danube (nuclear weapon)">
<text>Blue Danube was the first operational British nuclear weapon. It also went by a variety of other names, including Smallboy, the Mk.1 Atom Bomb, Special Bomb and OR.1001, a reference to the Operational Requirement it was built to fill.

The RAF V bomber force was initially meant to use Blue Danube as their primary armament at a time when the first hydrogen bomb had not been detonated, and the British military planners still believed that an atomic war could be fought and won using atomic bombs of similar yield to the Hiroshima bomb. For that reason the stockpile planned was for up to 800 bombs with yields of 10-12 kilotons. V-bomber bomb bays were sized to carry Blue Danube, the smallest-size nuclear bomb that was possible to be designed given the technology of the day (1947) when their plans were formulated.

==Design==

Initial designs for the Blue Danube warhead were based on research derived from Hurricane, the first British fission device (which was neither designed nor employed as a weapon), tested in 1952 at the Montebello Islands in Western Australia. The actual Blue Danube warhead was proof-tested during Operation Buffalo in Autumn of 1956 at the &quot;Marcoo&quot; (surface) and &quot;Kite&quot; (air-drop) nuclear trials at Maralinga, Australia, by a team of Australian, British and Canadian scientists.

During the &quot;Kite&quot; test on 11 October 1956, a Vickers Valiant of No. 49 Squadron RAF piloted by Squadron Leader Ted Flavell became the first British aircraft to drop a live atomic bomb.

Blue Danube added a ballistically shaped casing to the existing Hurricane physics package, with four flip-out fins to ensure a stable ballistic trajectory from the planned release height of 50,000 ft. It initially used a plutonium core, but all service versions were modified to use a composite plutonium/uranium-235 (U-235) core, and a version was also tested with a uranium-only core. The service chiefs insisted on a yield of between 10-12 kt for two reasons: firstly, to minimise usage of scarce and expensive fissile material; and secondly, to minimise the risk of predetonation, a phenomenon then little understood, and the primary reason for using a composite core of concentric shells of plutonium and U-235. Although there were many plans for versions with higher yields, some up to 40 kt, none were developed, largely because of the scarcity of fissile materials, and there is no evidence that any were seriously contemplated.

==Deployment==
The first Blue Danube was delivered to stockpile at RAF Wittering in November 1953 although there were no aircraft equipped to carry it until the following year. No. 1321 Flight RAF was established at RAF Wittering in April 1954 as a Vickers Valiant unit to integrate the Blue Danube nuclear weapon into RAF service. The Short Sperrin was also able to carry the Blue Danube and had been ordered as a fall-back option, in case the V-bomber projects proved unsuccessful.

Declassified archives show that 58 Blue Danubes were produced before production shifted in 1958 to the smaller and more capable Red Beard weapon, which could accept the Blue Danube fissile core and also could be carried by much smaller aircraft. It seems unlikely that all 58 Blue Danube weapons were operational at any given time. Blue Danube was retired in 1962. 

Bomb storage facilities for the weapon were built at RAF Barnham in Suffolk and RAF Faldingworth in Lincolnshire. These sites were built specifically to store bomb components in small buildings called &#x27;hutches&#x27; with the high explosive elements of the weapons stored in dedicated storage areas. The storage facilities were probably closed in 1963 and put up for sale in 1966, the Barnham site becoming an industrial estate. The site at Barnham is a scheduled monument.

==Problems==
Major deficiencies with Blue Danube included the use of unreliable lead-acid accumulators to supply power to the firing circuits and radar altimeters. Later weapons used the more reliable ram-air turbine-generators or thermal batteries. Blue Danube was not engineered as a weapon equipped to withstand the rigours of service life; it was a scientific experiment on a gigantic scale, which needed to be re-engineered to meet service requirements, resulting in Red Beard. The same could be said of the third U.S. atomic bomb, Fat Man, which was quickly re-engineered after World War II.

==Legacy==
Parts of a Blue Danube could be viewed by the public at old Sellafield Visitors Centre in Cumbria, England. This centre closed in 2008.
A replica Blue Danube bomb is displayed in the Gorse Industrial Estate (the former site of the RAF Barnham facilities) in Suffolk.

<doc id="664089" wikidata="Q19877069" url="?curid=664089" title="Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)">
<text>Yellow Sun was the first British operational high-yield strategic nuclear weapon warhead. The name refers only to the outer casing; the warhead (or physics package) was known as &quot;Green Grass&quot; in Yellow Sun Mk.1 and &quot;Red Snow&quot; (a US design) in Yellow Sun Mk.2.

Yellow Sun was designed to contain a variety of warheads. The initial plan was that it would carry an alarm-clock-type warhead known as &quot;Green Bamboo&quot;, and then replace it with a true thermonuclear warhead known as &quot;Green Granite&quot;. After signing a weapon technology agreement with the US, both concepts were dropped. Green Granite would be replaced by Red Snow at an earlier service date. This meant the interim Green Bamboo was less important and it was replaced by the less powerful and simpler &quot;Green Grass&quot;.

A unique feature of the Yellow Sun casing was its completely flat nose. This provided two benefits, one was that the drag allowed the bomb to fall behind the bomber a safe distance before detonation, and the other was that it did not generate the complex pattern of shock waves that a classically curved nose created, which made it difficult to measure altitude barometrically.

Mark 1 with Green Grass began to enter service in 1959, replacing the massive Blue Danube over the next year. Mark 2 with Red Snow began to replace it in 1961. Beginning in 1966, Yellow Sun was replaced by the WE.177, based on another US design.

==Design==

The casing was around long, and in diameter. The Mark 1 version with the Green Grass warhead weighed . The Mk.2 version with the lighter . The Red Snow warhead had ballast added to maintain overall weight, ballistic and aerodynamic properties, and avoid further lengthy and expensive testing, and changes to the electrical power generating and airburst fuze.

Unlike contemporary United States bombs of similar destructive power, Yellow Sun did not deploy a parachute to retard its fall. Instead, it had a completely flat nose which induced drag, thereby slowing the fall of the weapon sufficiently to permit the bomber to escape the danger zone. Additionally, the blunt nose ensured that Yellow Sun did not encounter the transonic/supersonic shock waves which had caused many difficulties with barometric fuzing gates which had plagued an earlier weapon, Blue Danube.

Electrical power was supplied by duplicated ram-air turbines located behind the twin air intakes in the flat nose. The earlier Blue Danube design had relied on lead–acid batteries which had proven to be both unreliable and to require time-consuming pre-flight warming.

==Warheads==
===Green Bamboo===
Yellow Sun Stage 1 and Stage 2 were the original designations. Stage 1 was intended as an interim design to carry a one megaton Green Bamboo warhead of the &quot;layer-cake&quot; type thought similar to the Soviet Sloika and the US Alarm Clock concepts. These hybrid designs are not now regarded as truly thermonuclear, but were then thought to be a stepping-stone on the route to a fusion bomb. Stage 2 was to follow when a true thermonuclear warhead based on the Green Granite design became available.

To produce the required yield, the implosion of the fissile core had to be extremely uniform. This required a complex 72-point explosive system, and led to a very large weapon overall. The resulting diameter of Green Bamboo determined the diameter of both Yellow Sun and the Blue Steel missile.

The launch of Sputnik 1 coincided with ongoing negotiations between the US and UK about nuclear technology, and the sudden shock of an apparent Soviet superiority swept aside lingering US concerns about the UK after the Suez Crisis. These negotiations would lead to the US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement in 1958. With access to US designs, the original plan to use Green Granite for Stage 2 was abandoned as a new thermonuclear warhead would be available before Granite would be. This meant the need for a powerful interim design to fill this time period was also considerably less important. The decision was made to cancel Green Bamboo and replace it with a simpler concept.

===Green Grass===

After Green Bamboo was abandoned a decision was made to use the Interim Megaton Weapon known as Green Grass in the Yellow Sun casing and designate it as Yellow Sun Mk.1 until better warheads were available for a Mk.2.

Green Grass was of similar layout to Green Bamboo, although it was not thermonuclear, being a very large unboosted pure fission warhead that was based in part on the core of the Orange Herald device tested at Grapple, with some of the implosion and firing features of Green Bamboo. The modulated neutron initiator was Blue Stone.

Twelve Green Grass warheads were fitted in the much larger, older casings derived from Blue Danube and known as &quot;Violet Club&quot;. These twelve warheads were later transferred to the Yellow Sun Mk.1 casings and supplemented by further warheads totalling 37.

Green Grass yield was originally stated to the Royal Air Force (RAF) as 500 kilotons of TNT equivalent (2.1 PJ), but the designers&#x27; estimate was later revised downwards to 400 kt of TNT. The Green Grass warhead was never tested. It used a dangerously large quantity of fissile material – thought to be in excess of , and considerably more than an uncompressed critical mass. It was kept subcritical by being fashioned into a thin-walled spherical shell. To guard against the accidental crushing of the core into a critical condition, the shell was filled with 133,000 steel ball-bearings, weighing . In a conflict, these would have had to be removed before flight. The RAF thought it unsafe (see ).

===Red Snow===
Red Snow was the US W28 warhead used in the US Mk-28 nuclear bomb. This was anglicised to adapt it to British engineering practices, and manufactured in Britain using British fissile materials. For further information see the &quot;Deployment&quot; section below.

==Deployment==
Deployment started in 1959–60. The RAF Service designations were &quot;Bomb, Aircraft HE 7000 lb HC Mk.1&quot; or &quot;Bomb, Aircraft HE 7000 lb HC Mk.2&quot;. Yellow Sun Mk.1 was intended as an &quot;emergency&quot; weapon, and had not been engineered for reliable long-term stockpiling. It was always envisaged that a Mk.2 version would be available later fitted with a true thermonuclear warhead derived from the Granite type tested at Grapple, or an American type made available after the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It was carried only by RAF V bombers.

In September 1958 a decision was made to abandon the Granite type warheads intended for Yellow Sun Mk.2 (and Blue Steel, and Blue Streak MRBM) and instead adopt the US W-28 warhead used in the US Mark 28 nuclear bomb. This was anglicised to adapt it to British engineering practices, and manufactured in Britain using British fissile materials and known as Red Snow. Red Snow was more powerful, lighter and smaller than Green Grass. It was always envisaged that the Yellow Sun bomb casing would be adapted for successor warheads to minimise unessential development time and cost. Yellow Sun Mk. 2 entered service in 1961, and remained the primary air-dropped strategic weapon until replaced with WE.177B in 1966.

Although the first British designed thermonuclear weapon to be deployed, Yellow Sun was not the first to be deployed with the RAF. US Mk-28 and Mk-43 thermonuclear bombs and others had been supplied to the RAF for use in V bombers prior to the deployment of Yellow Sun. Some bombers of the V-force only ever used American weapons supplied under dual-key arrangements.

<text>Archives station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green and Yellow Lines.

The station is located in Northwest Washington at 7th Street between Pennsylvania and Indiana Avenues, and it is very close to Gallery Place station, so close that the lights of one station can be seen down the tunnel from the other. It takes its name from the nearby National Archives. Its subtitle is derived from the U.S. Navy Memorial and the Penn Quarter neighborhood in which the station is located. It is a popular stop for tourists, with easy access to the northern side of the National Mall.

==History==
Service began on April 30, 1983. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail south of Gallery Place to L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and across a bridge over the Potomac River to the Pentagon station.

The station was originally named Archives. In 1989, the WMATA Board of Directors voted to rename the station to Archives–Navy Mem&#x27;l to recognize the nearby U.S. Navy Memorial. In 2004, it was renamed Archives–Navy Mem&#x27;l–Penn Quarter, in recognition of the nearby Penn Quarter neighborhood. &quot;Navy Mem&#x27;l&quot; and &quot;Penn Quarter&quot; were moved to a new subtitle, leaving &quot;Archives&quot; as the main name, on November 3, 2011, to go into effect on June 18, 2012 upon the publication of an updated system map. New signage was installed accordingly in 2005, following the 2004 renaming, and in late-spring 2012, following the late-2011 second renaming.

There is a provision for a future second mezzanine at the south end of the station, with a knock-out panel visible on the station&#x27;s south wall.

From March 26, 2020, until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Between January 15 to January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the 2020 Inauguration.

From October 12, 2021, to October 14, 2021, Blue Line Trains temporarily served this station due to a Blue Line Train derailment near the Pentagon Station.

==Station layout==
The station has an island platform accessed from the corner of Indiana Avenue and Seventh Street, NW.

<text>Red Snow was a British thermonuclear weapon, based on the US W28 (then called Mark 28) design used in the B28 thermonuclear bomb and AGM-28 Hound Dog missile. The US W28 had yields of and while Red Snow yields are still classified, declassified British documents indicate the existence of &quot;kiloton Red Snow&quot; and &quot;megaton Red Snow&quot; variants of the weapon, suggesting similar yield options, while other sources have suggested a yield of approximately .

==Development==
The Red Snow warhead was developed after a September 1958 decision to adopt the US warhead for British use, following the 1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It entered service in 1961, remaining in use until 1972, when it was replaced by the WE.177 bomb. Production numbers are classified, but it is believed that fewer than 150 weapons were produced.

Red Snow was used as both a free-fall bomb and as the warhead of the Blue Steel missile. In the gravity bomb role, it was fitted into the casing of the Yellow Sun weapon, even though the Red Snow warhead was considerably smaller than that of the original Yellow Sun bomb.

The Red Snow physics package was later reduced in size, weight and yield, and fitted with a smaller more modern primary, intended as a Red Beard replacement. Known as Una, this was later reduced in diameter and renamed Ulysses as the physics package intended for the UK warhead on the Skybolt project.

==Design==
Red Snow used the primary stage Peter, an anglicised version of the US Python device used in the W28. The Peter device contained of plutonium and of uranium. The kiloton Red Snow contained of plutonium, of uranium, of lithium deuteride and of tritium, while in megaton Red Snow all the values stayed the same except the lithium deuteride amount which increased to .

The device was fitted inside weapon cases from the older Yellow Sun weapons. This may have been to simplify crew retraining, simplify integration of the new weapon to existing platforms, or to hide the radical reduction in weapon size.

<doc id="664098" wikidata="Q836353" url="?curid=664098" title="List of language regulators">
<text>This is a list of bodies that consider themselves to be authorities on standard languages, often called language academies. Language academies are motivated by, or closely associated with, linguistic purism and prestige, and typically publish prescriptive dictionaries, which purport to officiate and prescribe the meaning of words and pronunciations. A language regulator may also have a more descriptive approach, however, while maintaining and promoting (but not imposing) a standard spelling. Many language academies are private institutions, although some are governmental bodies in different states, or enjoy some form of government-sanctioned status in one or more countries. There may also be multiple language academies attempting to regulate and codify the same language, sometimes based in different countries and sometimes influenced by political factors.

Many world languages have one or more language academies or official language bodies. However, the degree of control that the academies exert over these languages does not render the latter controlled natural languages in the sense that the various kinds of &quot;simple English&quot; (e.g. Basic English, Simplified Technical English) or George Orwell&#x27;s fictional Newspeak are. They instead remain natural languages to a considerable extent and are thus not formal languages such as Attempto Controlled English. They have a degree of standardization that allows them to function as standard languages (e.g. standard French). The English language has never had a formal regulator anywhere, outside of private productions such as the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

== Natural languages ==
== Constructed languages ==

Apart from the Akademio de Esperanto, most constructed languages (also called &quot;conlangs&quot;) have no true linguistic regulators or language academies.

=== Auxiliary languages ===


==== Esperanto ====

Esperanto and Ido have been &quot;constructed&quot; (or planned) by a person or small group, before being adopted and further developed by communities of users through natural language evolution.

Bodies such as the Akademio de Esperanto look at questions of usage in the light of the original goals and principles of the language.

==== Interlingua ====
Interlingua has no regulating body, as its vocabulary, grammar, and orthography are viewed as a product of ongoing social forces. In theory, Interlingua therefore evolves independent from any human regulator. Interlingua&#x27;s vocabulary is verified and recorded by dynamically applying certain general principles to an existing set of natural languages and their etymologies. The International Auxiliary Language Association ceased to exist in 1954, and according to the secretary of Union Mundial de Interlingua &quot;Interlingua doesn&#x27;t need its Academy&quot;.

=== Other constructed languages ===
== Other bodies ==
These bodies do not attempt to regulate any language in a prescriptive manner and are primarily concerned with aiding and advising the government on policies regarding language usage.

<doc id="664101" wikidata="Q7297909" url="?curid=664101" title="Red Beard (nuclear weapon)">
<text>Red Beard was the first British tactical nuclear weapon. It was carried by Royal Air Force (RAF) English Electric Canberra medium bombers and the V bomber force and by Supermarine Scimitars, de Havilland Sea Vixens, and Blackburn Buccaneers of the Royal Navy&#x27;s (RN) Fleet Air Arm (FAA). Developed to Operational Requirement OR.1127, it was introduced in 1961, entered service in 1962. It was replaced by the WE.177 in the early 1970s and was withdrawn from service in 1971.

==Design==
Red Beard was an unboosted fission weapon that used a composite core (mixed core in British terminology of the time). The composite core used both weapons-grade plutonium and weapons-grade uranium-235, and was intended to minimise the risk of pre-detonation that was a feature of all-plutonium designs of that period with yields larger than 10 kilotons (kt). An added benefit of the composite core was a more economical use of fissile material. The design was tested twice during the Operation Buffalo series of nuclear trials at Maralinga in Australia – first (codenamed &quot;Buffalo R1/One Tree&quot;) on 27 September 1956: a 15 kt explosion, after which the resulting mushroom cloud rose to a height of , and again (codenamed &quot;Buffalo R4/Breakaway&quot;) on 21 October 1956. Although the design concept of Red Beard was similar to that of the Blue Danube warhead, an innovative means of implosion meant that its overall size could be significantly reduced.

Its measurements were in length, in diameter, and a weight of approximately . Two versions were produced: the Mk.1, with a yield of 15 kilotons, and the Mk.2, with a yield of 25 kilotons. The Mk.2 was available in two variants, the No.1 used by high-altitude bombers, and the No.2 variant that was intended for low-level delivery by the toss bombing method, and its &#x27;over-the-shoulder&#x27; variant referred to as the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS).

Red Beard&#x27;s Royal Air Force and Royal Navy service designations were:
* Bomb, Aircraft, HE 2,000 lb MC Mk.1 No.1
* Bomb, Aircraft, HE 2,000 lb MC Mk.1 No.2
* Bomb, Aircraft, HE 2,000 lb MC Mk.2 No.1
* Bomb, Aircraft, HE 2,000 lb MC Mk.2 No.2

Weighing in at approximately , Red Beard was considerably lighter than the official service designation, which was based on the original technical requirement.

Another significant improvement over Blue Danube was the electrical system for the bomb firing mechanism and the radar altimeter fuse. Blue Danube had used 6 volt lead–acid batteries that were unreliable, and had to be installed at the last minute before takeoff. There were also potential risks associated with &#x27;stray&#x27; electrical discharges to the firing mechanisms which might have led to accidental detonation. Red Beard used twin ram-air turbines located in the nose, from which there could be no stray discharges before bomb release. The air inlet can be seen in the extreme nose. They exhausted through &#x27;blow-out&#x27; patches in the nose sides. Until bomb release, the weapon drew electrical power from the aircraft for heating and pre-heating of the radar fuzes.
Like Blue Danube, the body diameter at was greater than was desirable relative to the overall length of . To compensate for this stubbiness, and quickly stabilise the bomb after release, Red Beard was equipped with flip-out tail fins that were activated pneumatically, triggered by a lanyard attached to the aircraft.

As with Blue Danube, the fuzing arrangements were composed of twin radar fuzes that were activated by a barometric &#x27;gate&#x27; after release. The barometric gate ensured that the radar fuzes only transmitted in the last few seconds of free-fall, to a computed burst height, and this technique minimised the possibility of radar countermeasures disabling the radar fuzes. There were back-up contact and graze fuzes to ensure bomb destruction in the event of a misfire.

None of the variants allowed in-flight arming of the fissile core. The core was inserted before take-off, in a process referred to as &#x27;last minute loading&#x27;. For carrier-borne aircraft, landing with the armed weapon was forbidden, and the aircraft would instead be diverted to a shore airbase. Although the Royal Navy required its Sea Vixen aircraft to be type-approved for Red Beard carriage as insurance against delays in the development of the Blackburn Buccaneer, the Sea Vixen never deployed in the nuclear strike role. Early models were subject to severe environmental limitations, especially when loaded into Royal Navy Scimitars on exposed aircraft carrier decks in Northern waters. The Mk.2 variants were better engineered to withstand extreme conditions, and other than the yield difference, this was the main area of difference.

When the bomb was delivered by low-level toss bombing, the aircraft was almost always at a lower altitude than the burst height; so in effect, the bomb was not really &#x27;dropped&#x27;, but was released and &#x27;flew&#x27; upwards in a ballistic trajectory, to detonate when it reached the required altitude.

==Service in United Kingdom and Singapore==
Royal Air Force stocks of Red Beard for the Canberra and V-bomber forces totalled 110. Of these, forty-eight were deployed in Cyprus to meet the UK&#x27;s commitments to Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), forty-eight were deployed in Singapore at RAF Tengah to meet commitments to Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), and the remainder were located in the United Kingdom. Royal Navy stocks are believed, from archived declassified documents, to total thirty-five weapons, to be shared between five aircraft carriers, and shore-based supply and overhaul infrastructure. The carriers were thought (from similar sources) to each have an air-conditioned storage capacity for five Red Beard weapons.

Before the Red Beard codename was issued in 1952, it was frequently referred to in official documents as the &#x27;Javelin Bomb&#x27;, because it was originally conceived as a weapon for the &#x27;thin-wing Javelin bomber&#x27;, a projected derivative of the (thick wing) Gloster Javelin all-weather fighter. The designation &#x27;target marker bomb&#x27; was a euphemism used to disguise the nature of the bomb, so that its dimensions and weights etc. could be circulated to aircraft and aircraft equipment designers, without compromising security.

It was replaced by the WE.177 in the early 1970s.

==John Dolphin==
Whilst Chief Engineer at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE), Aldermaston, John Dolphin worked on the Red Beard trigger mechanism. Subsequently, in July 1959, Dolphin requested an ex-gratia financial award for his work on the weapon; but was turned down. His claim was that although it was not his job to do so, he invented the &#x27;Rotary Hot Line&#x27; device that eventually became the trigger for the Red Beard bomb (and which was used in all subsequent thermonuclear bombs). He further stated that his invention brought to an end the deadlock in meeting the specification for the Red Beard, and that he had to overcome &quot;serious opposition&quot; against the senior scientists whose job did include the brief for its invention. His claim was refused on the grounds that as a &#x27;Chief Engineer&#x27;, it was within the scope of his duties.
==Surviving examples==

At the Air Force Museum in Cosford, England, one is displayed on a trolley in front of a bomber. A training version is on display at the Explosion Museum of Naval Firepower.

<text>Mount Vernon Square station is a Washington Metro station in Washington, D.C., on the Green and Yellow Lines. It is the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line.

==Location==
Mount Vernon Square station is located at the border of the neighborhoods of Downtown and Shaw in the northwestern quadrant of Washington. Its namesake, Mount Vernon Square, is located two blocks to the south at the convergence of New York Avenue and Massachusetts Avenues and 7th, 9th, and K Streets. The station&#x27;s subtitle is derived from the station&#x27;s location along 7th Street NW and its proximity to the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. However, the station is only one of five Metro stations underneath 7th Street NW.

==Transit-oriented development==
Like many other Metro stations in the Washington Metropolitan Area, Mount Vernon Square station has spurred development in its proximity. Most prominent is the Washington Convention Center, although a number of smaller residential and commercial projects have been completed within the surrounding blocks. To the southeast of the station is the Mount Vernon Triangle, a business improvement district (BID) seeing rapid mixed-use growth. To the southwest of the station is the mixed-use CityCenterDC development project, which is home to luxury condominiums and luxury retail franchises such as Louis Vuitton, Moncler, Gucci, Hugo Boss, Tesla, Del Frisco&#x27;s Double Eagle Steak House, Fig &amp; Olive and other upscale dining and shopping destinations.

==History==
Service began on May 11, 1991. The station mezzanine was renovated in 2003 to coincide with the opening of the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. The renovation included additional faregates and a new street entrance.

In 2003, two redundant elevators near the entrance with escalators were opened and the station is the first station to get redundant elevators.

On January 7, 2007, the fifth car of a six-car train derailed in the tunnel at the interlocking south of the station, sending twenty people to the hospital for minor injuries and significantly damaging a rail car. Service resumed the next day at 5 AM.

Since May 25, 2019, Yellow Line trains no longer terminated at this station during rush hours and extended to at all times.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

From October 12, 2021 to October 14, 2021 Blue Line Trains temporarily served this station due to a derailment near the Arlington Cemetery Station.

Since May 7, 2023, the northeastern terminus of the Yellow Line was truncated from Greenbelt to this station, following its reopening after a nearly eight-month-long major rehabilitation project on its bridge over the Potomac River and its tunnel leading into .

===Name changes===
Originally to be named &quot;Federal City College&quot;, the station was named Mount Vernon Square–UDC at the time of its 1991 opening, reflecting the establishment of the University of the District of Columbia. The station was renamed Mt Vernon Sq/7th Street–Convention Center in 2001; the &quot;7th Street&quot; helped distinguish that the stop served the new Walter E. Washington Convention Center as opposed to the old Washington Convention Center at 9th Street NW. On November 3, 2011, the station was again renamed, taking &quot;Mount Vernon Square&quot; as the main name, with &quot;7th Street–Convention Center&quot; as a subtitle.

==Station layout==
The station) has a single island platform accessed from the southwest corner of Seventh and M Streets, NW. There is a pocket track just beyond the station going north, which is currently used to turn Yellow Line trains for service back to Huntington. It is also one of only two underground terminus stations in the Washington Metro, the other being Glenmont. The station also features the &quot;Arch II&quot; design found at Columbia Heights, Congress Heights, Georgia Avenue-Petworth, and Glenmont.

<doc id="664116" wikidata="Q1070069" url="?curid=664116" title="High church">
<text>The high church are the beliefs and practices of Christian ecclesiology, liturgy, and theology that emphasize &quot;ritual, priestly authority, [and] sacraments&quot;. Although used in connection with various Christian traditions, the term originated in and has been principally associated with the Anglican tradition, where it describes churches using a number of ritual practices associated in the popular mind with Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The opposite tradition is &quot;low church&quot;. Contemporary media discussing Anglican churches often prefer the terms evangelical to &quot;low church&quot; and Anglo-Catholic to &quot;high church&quot;, even though their meanings do not exactly correspond. Other contemporary denominations that contain high church wings include some Lutheran, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches.

==Variations==
Because of its history, the term &quot;high church&quot; also refers to aspects of Anglicanism quite distinct from the Oxford Movement or Anglo-Catholicism. There remain parishes that are &quot;high church&quot; and yet adhere closely to the quintessentially Anglican usages and liturgical practices of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;. These are now referred to as Centre Church.

High church Anglicanism tends to be closer than low church to Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox teachings and spirituality; its hallmarks are relatively elaborate music, altarpieces, and clergy vestments and an emphasis on sacraments. It is intrinsically .

&quot;High church&quot; nonetheless includes many bishops, other clergy and adherents sympathetic to mainstream modern consensus across reformed Christianity that, according to official Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian teachings, are anathema (see the ordination of women and to varying degrees abortion).

The term &quot;high church&quot; has also been applied to elements of Protestant churches within which individual congregations or ministers display a division in their liturgical practices, for example, &quot;high church Presbyterianism&quot; and &quot;high church Methodism&quot;, and within Lutheranism there is a historic &quot;high church&quot; and &quot;low church&quot; distinction comparable with Anglicanism (see Neo-Lutheranism and Pietism).

==Evolution of the term==

&quot;High church&quot; is a back-formation from &quot;high churchman&quot;, a label used in the 17th and early 18th centuries to describe opponents of religious toleration, with &quot;high&quot; meaning &quot;extreme&quot;. As the Puritans began demanding that the English Church abandon some of its traditional liturgical emphases, episcopal structures, parish ornaments and the like, the &quot;high church&quot; position also came to be distinguished increasingly from that of the Latitudinarians, also known as those promoting a broad church, who sought to minimise the differences between Anglicanism and Reformed Christianity, and to make the church as inclusive as possible by opening its doors as widely as possible to admit other Christian viewpoints.

Over time several of the leading lights of the Oxford Movement became Roman Catholics, following the path of John Henry Newman, one of the fathers of the Oxford Movement and, for a time, a high churchman himself. A lifelong High Churchman, the Reverend Edward Bouverie Pusey remained the spiritual father of the Oxford Movement who remained a priest in the Church of England. To a lesser extent, looking back from the 19th century, the term &quot;high church&quot; also came to be associated with the beliefs of the Caroline divines and with the pietistic emphases of the period, practised by the Little Gidding community, such as fasting and lengthy preparations before receiving the Eucharist.

===Before 1833===

During the reign of King James I, there were attempts to diminish the growth of party feeling within the Church of England, and indeed to reconcile to the Church moderate Puritans who did not already conform to the Established Church or who had left the Church in recent years. The project to create the Authorized Version of the Bible was one such attempt at reconciliation. The continued use of the King James version of the Bible, by Anglicans and other Protestants alike in the English-speaking world, is a reflection of the success of this endeavour at cooperation.

During the reign of King Charles I, however, as divisions between Puritan and Anglican elements within the Church of England became more bitter, and Protestant Nonconformity outside the Church grew stronger in numbers and more vociferous, the &quot;High Church&quot; position became associated with the leadership of the &quot;High Church&quot; Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, (see Laudianism), and government policy to curtail the growth of Protestant Dissent in England and the other possessions of the Crown. See, for example, the attempt to reimpose episcopacy on the Church of Scotland, a policy that was &#x27;successful&#x27; until the reign of William and Mary, when the office of bishop was discontinued except among the small minority of Scots who belonged to the Scottish Episcopal Church.

In the wake of the disestablishment of Anglicanism and the persecution of Anglican beliefs and practices under the Commonwealth, the return of the Anglican party to power in the Cavalier Parliament saw a strong revival of the &quot;High Church&quot; position in the English body politic. Victorious after a generation of struggle, the Anglican gentry felt the need to re-entrench the re-Anglicanised Church of England as one of the most important elements of the Restoration Settlement through a renewed and strengthened alliance between Throne and Altar, or Church and State. Reverence for martyrdom of the Stuart king Charles I as an upholder of his Coronation Oath to protect the Church of England became a hallmark of &quot;High Church&quot; orthodoxy. At the same time, the Stuart dynasty was expected to maintain its adherence to Anglicanism. This became an important issue for the High Church party and it was to disturb the Restoration Settlement under Charles II&#x27;s brother, King James II, a convert to Roman Catholicism, and lead to setbacks for the &quot;High Church&quot; party. These events culminated in the Glorious Revolution and the exclusion of the Catholic Stuarts from the British throne. The subsequent split over office-holders&#x27; oaths of allegiance to the Crown and the Royal Succession, which led to the exclusion of the Non-Juror bishops who refused to recognise the 1688 de facto abdication of the King, and the accession of King William III and Queen Mary II, and did much to damage the unity of &quot;High Church&quot; party.

Later events surrounding the attempts of the Jacobites, the adherents of the excluded dynasts, to regain the English and Scottish thrones, led to a sharpening of anti-Catholic rhetoric in Britain and a distancing of the High Church party from the more ritualistic aspects of Caroline High churchmanship, which were often associated with the schismatic Non-Jurors. Thomas Hancorne, a Welsh clergyman prominent in jacobite circles, gave the County of Swansea&#x27;s assize sermon on 18 April 1710 (&quot;The right way to honour and happiness&quot;), during which he complained of the &quot;rapid growth of deist, freethinking and anti-trinitarian views.&quot; The targets of Hancorne&#x27;s wrath were &quot;irreligion, profaneness and immorality&quot;, as well as the &quot;curious, inquisitive sceptics&quot; and the &quot;sin-sick tottering nation&quot;. Later, he engaged in a campaign to reassert tithe rights. Eventually, under Queen Anne, the High Church party saw its fortunes revive with those of the Tory party, with which it was then strongly associated.

However, under the early Hanoverians, both the High Church and Tory parties were once again out of favour. This led to an increasing marginalisation of High Church and Tory viewpoints, as much of the 18th century was given over to the rule of the Whig party and the aristocratic families who were in large measure pragmatic latitudinarians in churchmanship. This was also the Age of Reason, which marked a period of great spiritual somnolence and stultification in the Church of England.

Thus, by the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, those liturgical practices prevalent even in High Church circles were not of the same tenor as those later found under the Catholic revival of the 19th century. High Church clergy and laity were often termed &quot;high and dry&quot;, in reference to their traditional &quot;high&quot; attitude with regard to political position of the Church in England, and &quot;dry&quot; faith, which was accompanied by an austere but decorous mode of worship, as reflective of their idea of an orderly and dignified churchmanship against the rantings of the low churchmen that their Cavalier ancestors had defeated. Over time, their High Church position had become ossified among a remnant of bookish churchmen and country squires. An example of an early 19th-century churchman of this tradition is Sir Robert Inglis MP.

===From 1833===

Only with the success of the Oxford Movement and its increasing emphases on ritualistic revival from the mid-19th century onward, did the term &quot;High Church&quot; begin to mean something approaching the later term &quot;Anglo-Catholic&quot;. Even then, it was only employed coterminously in contrast to the &quot;Low&quot; churchmanship of the Evangelical position. This sought, once again, to lessen the separation of Anglicans (the Established Church) from the majority of Protestant Nonconformists, who by this time included the Methodists as well as adherents of older Protestant denominations like Baptists, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians known by the group term &quot;Old Dissent&quot;. 

In contrast to the Old High Church&#x27;s alliance with the Tories, Anglo-Catholicism became increasingly associated with socialism, the Labour Party and greater decision-making liberty for the church&#x27;s convocations.

From the mid-19th century onward, the term &quot;High Church&quot; generally became associated with a more Anglo-Catholic, while the Latitudinarians were referred to as being Broad Church and the re-emergent evangelical party was dubbed Low Church. However, &quot;high church&quot; can still refer to Anglicans of the pre-Oxford movement &quot;High Church&quot;, who hold a &quot;high&quot; view of the sacraments, church tradition and the threefold ministry but do not consider themselves Anglo-Catholics. This party is now called Center Church, or the Old High Church to differenciate it from the even higher Anglo-Catholic position.

<text>The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba () is the deliberative assembly of the Manitoba Legislature in the Canadian province of Manitoba. Fifty-seven members are elected to this assembly at provincial general elections, all in single-member constituencies with first-past-the-post voting. Bills passed by the Legislative Assembly are given royal assent by the lieutenant governor of Manitoba in the name of the King of Canada. The Manitoba Legislative Building is located in central Winnipeg.

The premier of Manitoba is Wab Kinew, and the speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba is Tom Lindsey. Both are members of the New Democratic Party.

Historically, the Legislature of Manitoba had another chamber, the Legislative Council of Manitoba, but this was abolished in 1876, just six years after the province was formed.

The 42nd Legislature was dissolved on September 5, 2023, and a general election was called for October 3. The 43rd Legislature opened on November 9.

<text>Capitol South station is a Washington Metro station in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. The island-platformed station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). The station currently provides service for the Blue, Orange, and Silver Lines.

==History==
The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium and the opening of the Arlington Cemetery, Crystal City, Eastern Market, Farragut West, Federal Center SW, Federal Triangle, Foggy Bottom–GWU, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, McPherson Square, National Airport, Pentagon, Pentagon City, Potomac Avenue, Rosslyn, Smithsonian and Stadium–Armory stations. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978.

The station was painted white sometime in the 2000s.

Silver Line service at Capitol South began on July 26, 2014.

Between January 15 and January 21, 2021, this station was closed because of security concerns due to the Inauguration of Joe Biden.

==Location==
Capitol South is located in the south-central section of the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Washington, D.C. It is surrounded by a wealth of government offices and buildings. Most importantly, it stands as the closest station to the Capitol Building which holds the Senate and House of Representatives. All three buildings of the Library of Congress are within a quarter-of-a-mile radius of Capitol South as are the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters. The Folger Shakespeare Library, the world&#x27;s largest collection of printed Shakespearean works is a five-minute walk west from the station.

== Station layout ==
There is only one entrance to the station located on the southwestern corner at the intersection of 1st Street SE and C Street SE. A row of three escalators and a staircase brings passengers to the station&#x27;s mezzanine level, where they may buy tickets from vending machines and pass through the faregates. Once passengers pass through these faregates, a pair of escalators brings passengers onto the platform. There are two elevators for handicapped passengers, one from street level to the mezzanine on the northwestern corner at the intersection of 1st Street SE and D Street SE and another between the mezzanine and platform.

Capitol South station utilises an island platform layout with two tracks, D1 and D2. Eastbound trains to New Carrollton or Downtown Largo use track D1 whilst westbound trains to Vienna, Franconia–Springfield, or Ashburn use track D2.

Sorell is one of Tasmania&#x27;s oldest towns, being first settled in 1808 as a small farming community and becoming an official township in 1821. At the , Sorell had a population of 1,546, and at the 2011 census, a population of 2,476. and at the 2016 census, a population of 2,907.

== History ==

=== Pre-contact ===
The Mumirimina People of the Oyster Bay Tribe traditionally lived in the Sorell area.

=== Post-contact ===
Sorell was first explored by Europeans by a party from Risdon Cove in 1803. This first exploration was done by Lieutenant Governor Collins, who originally named the area Pitt Water after the current Chancellor of the Exchequer. Sorell was later renamed after Lieutenant Governor William Sorell by Governor Lachlan Macquarie on a tour. Fertile land was discovered, and it was first settled in 1808, but remained an isolated farming community until 1821 when the town was established. Th Sorell Post Office opened on 1 June 1832. Historically, it was a granary for the colony, and became known as the &quot;granary of Australia.&quot; It was known as a major town on the route from Hobart to Port Arthur on the Tasman Peninsula. It was the centre of an agricultural area and an important market town. It is now a dormitory town of Hobart, as well as the seat of the Sorell Council, which was established in 1862.

Telegraph service was introduced in 1876, a railway in 1892, a water supply in 1916, and electricity in 1930. In 1872 the Sorell Causeway was opened across Pitt Water, considerably shortening the route to Hobart, which otherwise relied on ferries or a route through Richmond.

==Infrastructure==
Sorell is served by Sorell School, the oldest continually operating public school in Australia, opened in 1821. It is a co-educational primary and secondary school, serving years K-12. Sorell is served by a Libraries Tasmania library, a Service Tasmania office, and Australia Post Office.

Sorell Plaza shopping centre, built in the mid 2000s, provides a supermarket and other major retail outlets. It was purchased by SCA Property Group, a subsidiary of Woolworths, in 2019. Gateway Shopping Center includes a competing supermarket and small retail.

Sorell falls within the Anglican Parish of South East Tasmania, based at St George&#x27;s Church, and the Parish of Richmond, with services at St Thomas&#x27;s Church. Historically, it was also served by the Presbyterian Scots Church, designed by James Blackburn, which is now a private residence.

Sorell has a number of historic buildings, including the Sorell Barracks, constructed to house soldiers during the Black War. These and other historic buildings - including the railway house, the old Sorell Library (now an antiques centre), and the Gordon Highlander Hotel, form a heritage walk. The area also has a local historical society as well as a Freemasons Lodge (Lodge Pembroke).

<text>Stadium–Armory station is a Washington Metro station in Southeast, Washington, D.C. It is located at the border of the Barney Circle and Kingman Park neighborhoods. The station was opened on July 1, 1977, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Stadium–Armory serves the Blue, Orange and Silver Lines.

The station is a transfer station, as this is the last station shared by the three lines before the lines diverge going east; east of the station, all three lines rise above ground onto elevated track to cross the Anacostia River. At the diverge point, the Orange Line continues above ground veering northbound towards the station, and the Blue and Silver Lines continue eastbound entering a tunnel towards .

== Location ==

The Stadium–Armory station serves the Barney Circle and Kingman Park neighborhoods. It was adjacent to the now-defunct RFK Stadium, which was the former home of the D.C. United soccer team, the Washington Redskins, and the Washington Nationals, as well as of the second Washington Senators franchise before their relocation to Texas in 1972. The station also serves the D.C. Jail, and D.C. Armory, which is a popular venue for shows and entertainment and the headquarters of the District of Columbia National Guard. Together with the Potomac Avenue station, Stadium-Armory is one of two Metro stations within walking distance of Congressional Cemetery. Before its closure in 2001, D.C. General Hospital was served by the Stadium–Armory station.

With the redevelopment of the former D.C. General Hospital campus into a new mixed-use waterfront neighborhood called &quot;Hill East&quot;, the neighborhood around the Stadium–Armory station will be in transition for the first time in years. After RFK Stadium&#x27;s last major tenant, D.C. United, relocated to the new soccer-specific stadium Audi Field in Buzzard Point July 2018, the stadium was left abandoned until initial demolition consisting of removing interior furnishings commenced. After sitting abandoned for years, the stadium was finally torn down in 2025, after president Joe Biden signed a bill transferring control of the RFK Stadium campus to the District, with the site being a leading contender for a new NFL stadium to bring the Commanders back to DC.

==History==
===20th century===
The station opened on July 1, 1977. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail between National Airport and RFK Stadium. Orange Line service to the station began upon the line&#x27;s opening on November 20, 1978. The station is the last underground station for eastbound Orange, Blue and Silver lines combined.

In 1979, the D.C. Armory requested that the station name be changed to &quot;Starplex&quot; for the Stadium Armory Complex, but that request was ignored by the Metro Board. Stadium–Armory would also serve as the eastern terminus of the Blue Line from its opening through the opening of its extension to on November 22, 1980.

===21st century===
The station was supposed to be the Silver Line&#x27;s eastern terminus, but in December 2012, due to safety concerns regarding a pocket track between this station and and Benning Road, Metro officials decided to extend the line into nearby Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland to Largo, which is the eastern terminus of the Blue Line. Silver Line service at Stadium-Armory began on July 26, 2014.

Between May 28 and September 5, 2022, all Orange Line trains were terminating at Stadium–Armory station due to the Platform Improvement Project which closed stations north of Stadium–Armory station. On weekends, all Blue and Silver Line trains were terminating Stadium–Armory while Orange Line trains were cutback to Ballston–MU due to aerial structure repairs along the D route.

====Transformer fire====
On September 21, 2015, a transformer caught fire near the station, causing severe delays. The reduced power as a result of the loss of the transformer caused WMATA to implement strategies to combat congestion in the system. This included having Orange and Silver line trains skip the Stadium–Armory station during rush hours, but service had been restored as of November.

== Station layout ==
Stadium-Armory is an island platform station with two tracks. Track D1 is for eastbound trains to New Carrollton or Largo and track D2 is for westbound trains to Vienna, Franconia–Springfield, or Ashburn. An indicator sign at the north end of the station flashes to inform passengers of the arriving train&#x27;s destination, showing Orange for New Carrollton, and Blue and/or Silver for Largo. This feature is only used at final transfer stations; another example being . North of the station, the tracks emerge onto an elevated structure continuing east across the Anacostia river. After an elevated pocket track, the D&amp;G Junction splits the Orange Line with the Blue and Silver lines as they each continue east into Maryland.

The station has two entrances along 19th Street SE; the north entrance at Independence Avenue and the south entrance between C &amp; Burke Streets SE. Elevator access is at the south entrance.

<doc id="664166" wikidata="Q5032200" url="?curid=664166" title="Cane Ridge, Kentucky">
<text>Cane Ridge was the site of a huge camp meeting in 1801, the Cane Ridge Revival, that drew thousands of people and had a lasting influence as one of the landmark events of the Second Great Awakening, which took place largely in frontier areas of the United States. The event was led by eighteen Presbyterian ministers, but numerous Methodist and Baptist preachers also spoke and assisted. Many of the &quot;spiritual exercises&quot;, such as glossolalia and ecstatic attendees, were exhibited that in the 20th century became more associated with the Pentecostal movement.

Cane Ridge is located in Bourbon County, Kentucky, near Paris. The ridge was named by the explorer Daniel Boone, who had noticed a form of bamboo growing there. The Cane Ridge building and grounds had many unusual aspects. The 1791 Cane Ridge Meeting House is believed to be the largest single-room log structure in North America. The burial ground contains an unmarked section that is among the largest in the country. A Christian church congregation met on the site for many years after the 1801 revival meeting, and the congregation&#x27;s leaving the Presbyterian Church in 1804. Barton W. Stone was its minister and one of the leading ministers of the Christian Church. This place was so dear to him that at his request, several years after his death, his remains were reinterred there.

Led by Barton Stone, the Cane Ridge Revival is associated with the development of what became known as the Restoration Movement. Stone and several other ministers left the Presbyterian Church in 1804 and established the Christian Church. Another element of the Restoration Movement was Alexander Campbell&#x27;s Disciples of Christ. In 1832, Stone and Campbell agreed to combine their efforts in the Restoration Movement. Later groups developed as the Churches of Christ and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada, and several smaller groups.

==Meetinghouse==
The Christian Church used a log building as their meeting house; it was modernized many times. When the congregation ceased to meet there regularly in the 1920s, the building fell into disuse. Later, historically minded persons, predominantly from the Disciples, restored the building and preserved it by building a stone shrine to surround and protect it.

The restoration of the original slave gallery in the meetinghouse was the oldest documented such restoration in the United States. In the 1820s, the congregation had removed the slave gallery, because they supported abolitionism. When preservationists began restoration work in the 1930s, they re-installed the original cherry-railed gallery. It was found and returned from a local barn, where it had served as a hay loft for more than a century.
The meeting house continues to be used as a living church. A curator is available for guided tours by appointment.

The Barton Warren Stone Museum contains artifacts of the congregation, Barton W. Stone and his family, the Stone-Campbell movement, and antique farm and household equipment. The museum is open only in the summer. It also houses the office of the Cane Ridge Preservation Projects and a book shop.

<text>The Binghamton Senators were a professional ice hockey team in the American Hockey League (AHL) that played from 2002 to 2017. Nicknamed the B-Sens, they played in Binghamton, New York, at the Floyd L. Maines Veterans Memorial Arena. The B-Sens were minor league affiliates of the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League. In 2017, the B-Sens&#x27; franchise was relocated by the Ottawa Senators to become the Belleville Senators. Binghamton then replaced the franchise with the Binghamton Devils, the AHL franchise of the New Jersey Devils.

They were the AHL&#x27;s 2010–11 Calder Cup champions. The Senators&#x27; main rivals were the nearby teams, the Syracuse Crunch, the Rochester Americans, the Albany Devils, the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and the Hershey Bears.

==History==

===Inception and first seasons (2002–2005)===
The arrival of the B-Sens marked the return of the AHL to the area after a five-year absence. The Rhode Island Reds, a charter member of the AHL, moved to Binghamton in 1977 and played there until 1997, known variously as the Binghamton Dusters (1977–1980), the Binghamton Whalers (1980–1990), and the Binghamton Rangers (1990–1997). While no AHL team played in Binghamton between 1997 and 2002, the market was served by the B.C. Icemen of the United Hockey League.

The Binghamton Senators enjoyed a successful 2002–03 inaugural season, going 43–26–9 with 100 points. They breezed by their first two playoff rounds, but were easily defeated by the Hamilton Bulldogs in five games. By contrast, the 2003–04 season was not as successful as the loss of both Antoine Vermette and Jason Spezza weakened the team. They went 34–34–9 and exited the playoffs in a two-game sweep at the hands of the Norfolk Admirals.

The 2004–05 NHL lockout meant Binghamton got a return visit from their recent graduates and several other NHL players, including Jason Spezza, Antoine Vermette, Anton Volchenkov, Chris Neil, Josh Langfeld, and Brian Pothier, making the Senators a legitimate Calder Cup contender. Jason Spezza led the way with a league high 117 points (earning the AHL MVP). The Senators ended the regular season with only 21 regulation losses, tied for second fewest in the league, taking the division title with a league high 276 goals scored. The Senators entered the playoffs on a roll, winning 11 of their last 13 games, and continued their dominance by cruising through the first two games of their first round best-of-seven series against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, scoring nine goals. But the offense stalled and the Sens scored only five goals in the remaining four games as the Penguins eliminated Binghamton.

===Later seasons (2009–2017)===

On July 17, 2009, Don Nachbaur was named head coach of the Binghamton Senators. During the 2009–10 AHL season, Nachbaur coached the Senators to a 36–35–6–3 record and 81 points to finish fifth in the AHL&#x27;s East Division. On June 22, 2010, after only one season behind the bench, Nachbaur announced that he was resigning as head coach citing personal reasons. Kurt Kleinendorst was then appointed the head coach of the B-Sens with a two-year contract. Kleinendorst had spent the previous year leading the USA Hockey National Team Development Program&#x27;s under-18 team to a gold medal at the 2010 IIHF World U18 Championships in Belarus.

In his first season as head coach, Kleinedorst led the Senators to a fifth-place finish in the East Division. The B-Sens qualified for the 2011 playoffs against the Manchester Monarchs in the first round. They fell behind 3–1 in the series, but won games five and six in overtime to force a game seven. The Senators fell behind 5–4 in game seven, but Erik Condra tied the game with 1:45 remaining in the third period. Ryan Potulny then scored 3:07 into overtime to send the Senators to the second round. Next, the Senators faced the Portland Pirates and won the first two games in Portland to go up 2–0 in the series. They then lost two of the next three games at home to the Pirates and had their series lead cut to 3–2. The Senators shut out the Pirates in game six, 3–0, to go to the Eastern Conference final. In the Eastern Conference final, the Senators faced the Charlotte Checkers. The Senators dominated the series, outscoring the Checkers 21–8, 11–4 at home and 10–4 on the road. In game four, Ryan Keller got the game-winning goal in overtime to send the Senators to the Calder Cup finals.

In the finals, the Senators played the Houston Aeros. The Senators fell behind 2–1 in the series, but a two-game home-ice winning streak gave them the 3–2 lead. The Senators won game six in Houston on June 7, 2011, to capture their first ever Calder Cup, with Ryan Keller scoring the game-winning goal 9:09 into the third period of the deciding game.

In the 2011–12 season, the Senators faced a completely revised lineup as free agents left to join other NHL organizations and several players became full-time Ottawa Senators. The team finished fifth and did not qualify for the playoffs. Head coach Kleinendorst resigned after the season to pursue other opportunities. He was replaced by former NHL player and Ottawa assistant coach Luke Richardson as the team&#x27;s seventh head coach.

In the 2012–13 offseason, the Senators made several moves in free agency, including bringing back former player Andre Benoit to be the Senators&#x27; captain. The NHL lockout also allowed several Ottawa top prospects, such as Jakob Silfverberg and Mika Zibanejad, to start the season in Binghamton. The Senators stormed out to a 27–10–4 start by the all-star break, holding the best record in the AHL at one point. The Senators then lost many players, including Benoit, Silfverburg, Zibanejad and Patrick Wiercioch, to Ottawa as the NHL regular season started. The Senators went 17–14–4 the rest of the way to finish second in the East Division, claim the fourth seed for the playoffs, and finish with a 44–24–8 record overall. However, the Senators offense struggled against the physical play of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins and swept the Senators out of the playoffs, three-games-to-none.

The Senators returned almost the entire team from the previous year for the 2013–14 season; the most notable exception being goaltender Robin Lehner, who became Ottawa&#x27;s regular backup goalie. The Senators contended for the division lead for the entire season. Despite goaltender Nathan Lawson having an injury-filled year, Andrew Hammond filled his spot with 25 wins and a 2.81 GAA. Even with the Senators losing leading scorers Mike Hoffman and Stephane Da Costa along with Mark Stone, Cody Ceci and Jean-Gabriel Pageau, and others to Ottawa during the second half of the year, the Senators clinched their third division title since the 2004–05 season. The division title came on a 5–4 win over the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in the second-to-last game of the season to clinch the third seed in the Eastern Conference. For the second year in a row, the Senators played the Penguins in the first round of the playoffs. The first three games of the series were close, all of them going to overtime, but the Senators went down 2–1 in the series. Facing a must-win game four in Wilkes-Barre, the B-Sens were routed by the Penguins 5–1, bowing out in the first round once again.

After the end of the 2015–16 season, head coach Luke Richardson resigned from his position with the organization. Richardson was replaced by the coach he took over for in 2012, Kurt Kleinendorst, on June 8, 2016.

In July 2016, Broome County officials stated that the Ottawa Senators intended to relocate their franchise closer to the parent club in Canada for the 2017–18 season, but that the &quot;AHL has committed to staying in Binghamton and Broome County&quot; due to the B-Sens having three more years left on their lease in 2017. Most reports have conjectured that the relocated Senators franchise would be in Belleville, Ontario, due to plans to renovate Yardmen Arena announced in June 2016. On September 26, Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk confirmed he had purchased the Binghamton Senators and would relocate the team to become the Belleville Senators for the 2017–18 season. After the Ottawa Senators&#x27; announcement of the relocation, the Binghamton organization reconfirmed they were working towards keeping AHL hockey in Binghamton for 2017–18. On January 31, 2017, the Binghamton organization announced it had signed a five-year agreement to operate the New Jersey Devils&#x27; AHL affiliate beginning with the 2017–18 season as the Binghamton Devils.

<text>There are many roads in the southwestern part of British Columbia and Vancouver Island that were designated as Highway 1A. These roads were sections of the original 1941 route of Highway 1 before its various re-alignments, and are used today as service routes and frontage roads. The &quot;B.C. Highway 1A&quot; designations were removed from these sections by the province between 2005 and 2010, although signage remains along some of the route and the designation on some maps.

A long segment of highway in North Cowichan and Ladysmith designated as Highway 1A. It starts in the south at the intersection of Highway 1 and Mount Sicker Road, the Highway follows Mount Sicker Road and Chemainus Road east for to an intersection with Crofton Road, which provides access to the community of Crofton. Chemainus Road and Highway 1A turns northwest, and goes for through Chemainus to the intersection with Roland Lane, where it subsequently turns west to meet the Trans-Canada Highway on the south end of Ladysmith. This route was the original &quot;Island Highway&quot; prior to the opening of the existing Trans-Canada Highway, which was constructed to bypass the Chemainus area in 1950.
=== Greater Victoria ===

Since 1941, Highway 1A went from Victoria to Kelsey Bay, ending at the wharf. By 1960, Highway 1 ended at Nanaimo&#x27;s Departure Bay Ferry terminal.

A long segment of highway in Greater Victoria was designated as Highway 1A. It started in Victoria at the intersection of Hillside Avenue and Government Street, following Gorge Road West for until it reached an intersection at Admirals Road, and crossed the Craigflower Bridge. Highway 1A then proceeded west along the Old Island Highway for to Goldstream Avenue. Highway 1A continued onto Goldstream Avenue and proceeded west through downtown Langford for to its termination at Highway 1 just short of Goldstream Provincial Park. This route was the original Island Highway prior to the opening of the existing Trans-Canada Highway route in 1955 and 1956.
== Lower Mainland ==

Until the Highway 1 Freeway (originally the &quot;401&quot;) was built in the mid-1960s, much of the Fraser Highway was part of the Trans-Canada Highway. It was built along the route of Old Yale Road, which was first built in 1874 between Yale and New Westminster. The Fraser Highway route was designated as Highway 1 from 1941 to 1972 while the new freeway was designated as Highway 401 until 1972. In 1973, the freeway route became Highway 1 while the Fraser Highway became Highway 1A. In 2006, Highway 1A was decommissioned between Downtown Vancouver and Abbotsford, with a segment of Highway 1A between West Vancouver and Vancouver remaining, but concurrent with Highway 99 for its entirety; the 1A designation was eventually deemed redundant and dropped in 2016.

=== Route description ===
Highway 1A began at Highway 1 (Exit 13) in West Vancouver and shared the alignment with Highway 99 along Taylor Way, Marine Drive, the Lions Gate Bridge and the Stanley Park Causeway through Stanley Park to Georgia Street the West End and Downtown Vancouver. Highway 99 diverges south along Howe Street (northbound Highway 99 uses Seymour Street), and Highway 1A shared long concurrency with Highway 99A. The route followed the Georgia Viaduct out of downtown to Main Street (westbound traffic used Dunsmuir Street) to Main Street. It then followed Kingsway through East Vancouver and Burnaby to New Westminster, where it followed 10th Avenue (which forms the boundary between Burnaby and New Westminster) and McBride Boulevard. It crossed the Fraser River along the Pattullo Bridge into Surrey, where the roadway became the King George Highway (renamed &quot;King George Boulevard&quot; in 2009). Highways 1A and 99A diverged with Highway 1A following the Fraser Highway southeast intersecting Highway 15 before reaching Highway 10 in Langley. Highway 1A briefly left Fraser Highway (which passes through downtown Langley), following the Langley Bypass and a short concurrency with Highway 10 to Glover Road, before rejoining Fraser Highway. Highway 1A continued southeast to Highway 13 at Aldergrove (in Langley Township), and continued into Abbotsford where it terminated at Highway 1 (Exit 83), just east of Mount Lehman Road. Its total pre-2006 length was .

With the decommissioning of the Highway 1A designation, the original Trans-Canada Highway route is now known merely as the Fraser Highway between Surrey to Abbotsford. The province of British Columbia still has a section of the Fraser Highway between Highway 15 and Highway 13 in its highway inventory; however the route is maintained by TransLink. Despite the decommissioning of the route as of 2023 brand new 1A and 99A route markers can be found along the route.

The new DriveBC Beta website displays the most &quot;recent&quot; alignment of highway 1A as a complete, official signed highway route from its shared alignment with 99 north of the Lions Gate through Vancouver, New Westminster, Surrey, and the Langley Bypass to its junction with BC 1 in Abbotsford. 99A is shown in concurrency from the 1A junction to the Lions Gate but not down King George blvd to the border.

;Footnotes
=== Chilliwack ===

The Chilliwack-Rosedale Yale Road East section ran from the Trans-Canada Highway at the Vedder Road crossing (Exit 119), through Chilliwack and Rosedale, and reconnecting to the Trans-Canada Highway along with Highway 9 (Exit 135). This section of what was originally the Yale Road was part of the original Trans-Canada Highway route until the completion of the &quot;401&quot; Freeway section in the 1960s. In 2005, the City of Chilliwack posted signage along the Yale Road East section designating it as the &quot;Trans-Canada Parallel Route&quot;.
== Kicking Horse Pass ==
A former section of Highway 1A exists along the former &quot;Kicking Horse Trail&quot;, the original road between Lake Louise and Golden that opened in 1926. When the Trans-Canada Highway was realigned in 1962, the segment became Highway 1A. It began at Highway 1, west of the Alberta border in Yoho National Park and meandered eastward through Kicking Horse Pass to Lake Louise. The route is now closed to vehicle traffic and is part the Great Divide hiking trail.

<text>Edgar Douglas Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian (30 November 1889 – 4 August 1977) was an English electrophysiologist and recipient of the 1932 Nobel Prize for Physiology, won jointly with Sir Charles Sherrington for work on the function of neurons. He provided experimental evidence for the all-or-none law of nerves.

==Biography==
Adrian was born in Hampstead, London, the youngest son of Alfred Douglas Adrian, legal adviser to the Local Government Board, and Flora Lavinia Barton.

He was educated at Westminster School and then studied Natural Sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1911. In 1913 he was elected to a fellowship of Trinity College on account of his research into the &quot;all or none&quot; law of nerves.

After completing a medical degree (MB BCh) in 1915, he undertook clinical work at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital London during World War I, treating soldiers with nerve damage and nervous disorders such as shell shock. Adrian returned to Cambridge as a lecturer gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1919 and in 1925 began research on the human sensory organs by electrical methods.

===Career===
Continuing earlier studies of Keith Lucas, he used a capillary electrometer and cathode-ray tube to amplify the signals produced by the nervous system and was able to record the electrical discharge of single nerve fibres under physical stimulus. (It seems he used frogs in his experiments) An accidental discovery by Adrian in 1928 proved the presence of electricity within nerve cells. Adrian said,

I had arranged electrodes on the optic nerve of a toad in connection with some experiments on the retina. The room was nearly dark and I was puzzled to hear repeated noises in the loudspeaker attached to the amplifier, noises indicating that a great deal of impulse activity was going on. It was not until I compared the noises with my own movements around the room that I realised I was in the field of vision of the toad&#x27;s eye and that it was signalling what I was doing.

A key result, published in 1928, stated that the excitation of the skin under constant stimulus is initially strong but gradually decreases over time, whereas the sensory impulses passing along the nerves from the point of contact are constant in strength, yet are reduced in frequency over time, and the sensation in the brain diminishes as a result.

Extending these results to the study of pain causes by the stimulus of the nervous system, he made discoveries about the reception of such signals in the brain and spatial distribution of the sensory areas of the cerebral cortex in different animals. These conclusions lead to the idea of a sensory map, called the homunculus, in the somatosensory system.

Later, Adrian used the electroencephalogram to study the electrical activity of the brain in humans. His work on the abnormalities of the Berger rhythm paved the way for subsequent investigation in epilepsy and other cerebral pathologies. He spent the last portion of his research career investigating olfaction.

Positions that he held during his career included Foulerton Professor 1929–1937; Professor of Physiology in the University of Cambridge 1937–1951; President of the Royal Society 1950–1955; Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1951–1965; president of the Royal Society of Medicine 1960–1962; Chancellor of the University of Cambridge 1967–1975; Chancellor of the University of Leicester 1957–1971. Adrian was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society in 1938. He was elected an International Member of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1941. In 1946 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1942 he was awarded membership to the Order of Merit and in the 1955 New Year Honours was created Baron Adrian, of Cambridge in the County of Cambridge.

==Family==

On 14 June 1923 Edgar Adrian married Hester Agnes Pinsent, who was the daughter of Ellen Pinsent and sister of David Pinsent.
Together they had three children, first a daughter and then twins:
* Anne Pinsent Adrian, who married the physiologist Richard Keynes, who was the great-grandson of Charles Darwin. The couple had four children.
** Adrian Keynes (1946–1974)
** Randal Keynes (*1948)
** Roger Keynes (*1951)
** Simon Keynes (*1952)
* Richard Adrian, 2nd Baron Adrian (1927–1995)
** The couple had no children.
* Jennet Adrian (b. 1927), who married Peter Watson Campbell
** Further family details unknown.

<text>Benning Road station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in the Benning Ridge neighborhood of Northeast Washington, D.C., United States. The station was opened on November 22, 1980, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue and Silver Lines, the station is located in a residential area near the intersection of Benning Road and East Capitol Street. It is the first station after the Blue and Silver Lines diverge from the Orange Line east of the Anacostia River, and also the last station in the District of Columbia going east.

==History==
The station opened on November 22, 1980, and coincided with the completion of of rail east of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Addison Road and Capitol Heights stations.

In December 2012, Benning Road was one of five stations added to the route of the Silver Line, which was originally supposed to end at the Stadium–Armory station, but was extended into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, to the Largo Town Center station (the eastern terminus of the Blue Line, now known as ) due to safety concerns about a pocket track just east of Stadium–Armory. Silver Line service at Benning Road began on July 26, 2014.

==Station layout==
The station features the 22-coffer &quot;waffle&quot; ceiling vault design among , , , , and .

<text>Capitol Heights station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Capitol Heights, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on November 22, 1980, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Blue and Silver Lines, the station is located at 133 Central Avenue in a residential area at East Capitol Street and Southern Avenue SE. This is the first station on the two lines in Maryland going east. As of 2017, in terms of weekday average boardings, it is the least used underground station in the system and the 10th least used station overall.

==History==
The station opened on November 22, 1980, and coincided with the completion of of rail east of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Addison Road and Benning Road stations.

In December 2012, Capitol Heights was one of five stations added to the route of the Silver Line, which was originally supposed to end at the Stadium-Armory station, but was extended into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland to the Largo Town Center (now ) station (the eastern terminus of the Blue Line) due to safety concerns about a pocket track just past Stadium-Armory. Silver Line service at Capitol Heights began on July 26, 2014.

In 1997, Radisson station of the Montreal Metro&#x27;s Green Line was redressed to stand in for Capitol Heights in the Bruce Willis movie &quot;The Jackal&quot;.

<text>Huon Valley Council is a local government body in Tasmania, covering most of the south of the state. Huon Valley is classified as a rural local government area and has a population of 17,219, towns and localities of the region include Cygnet, Dover, Franklin, Geeveston, Southport and the largest principal town, Huonville.

==History and attributes==
In 1993 the municipalities of Esperance, Huon and Port Cygnet were amalgamated to form the Huon Valley Council. Remote subantarctic Macquarie Island, which is located some 1400 km southeast of Tasmania proper, was part of Esperance until then, and has been administratively part of the Huon Valley since then.

===Demographics===
Huon Valley is classified as rural, agricultural and very large under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.

The townships in the south east region of Tasmania that experienced the largest growth over the decade ending June 2011 were Huonville, Franklin (where the population was up by 1,300 people) and Cygnet (up by 440).

==Council==
Council members as elected in 2022 elections.

== 2016 Council misconduct and removal from office ==
In 2016 the entire Huon Valley Council was removed from council by the state Minister for Local Government after a long period of gross dysfunction and misconduct. The municipality was subsequently put under controlled of a Commissioner; former Glenorchy mayor and Elwick MLC Adriana Taylor, until new elections were held over a three-week period concluding on 30 October 2018.

<text>Addison Road station is a rapid transit station on the Washington Metro&#x27;s Silver and Blue Lines. It is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, who opened it in 1980. It was the eastern end of the Blue Line until 2004. The station is in Seat Pleasant on Central Avenue, although its official address puts it in Capitol Heights.

==History==
The station, which has a single central platform, opened on November 22, 1980, and coincided with the completion of of rail east of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Benning Road and Capitol Heights stations. The station features escalators with the elevator between them as seen at North Bethesda and Union Station between the mezzanine and platform. The station was originally named &quot;Addison Road&quot;; the name &quot;Seat Pleasant&quot; was added in 2000 and moved to a new subtitle location in 2011. It was the eastern terminus of the Blue Line from its opening until December 18, 2004, when the extension to the Largo Town Center (now known as ) station opened to the east. In the early eighties, due to peculiarities of the system at the time, trains travelling &quot;toward&quot; Addison Road showed blue rollsigns, but switched to orange signs before departing westward, back into the city.

In December 2003, security cameras at this station filmed a deer walking around the station mezzanine, running down an escalator, and going down the platform past a waiting train, as startled passengers watched. The deer then jumped onto the tracks and escaped into nearby woods. Metro spokesperson Lisa Farbstein reported that Metro had nicknamed the deer &quot;Rudolph the Blue Line Reindeer&quot;.

In December 2012, Addison Road was one of five stations added to the route of the Silver Line, which was originally supposed to end at the station, but was extended into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, to Largo (the eastern terminus of the Blue Line) due to safety concerns about a pocket track just past Stadium-Armory. Silver Line service at Addison Road began on July 26, 2014.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The platform at the Addison Road station would be rebuilt from February 13 to May 23, 2021.

<doc id="664203" wikidata="Q6911589" url="?curid=664203" title="Morgan Boulevard station">
<text>Morgan Boulevard station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Summerfield, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, with a Landover postal address. The station was opened on December 18, 2004, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). It provides service for the Blue and Silver Lines.

==Facilities and nearby landmarks==
The station is located on Garrett Morgan Boulevard, one mile (1.6 km) from Northwest Stadium, home to the Washington Commanders. The stadium is about a 20 minute walk from the station.

This is one of the few stations not served by Metrobus. The Prince George&#x27;s County bus system, called simply TheBus, serves this station. The platform at this station is wider than others and the station features double the number of faregates of similar stations because of the large volumes of passengers using it before and after football games. For commuters, there is a day care facility at the station.

==History==
In October 1996, the proposed routing for the extension of the Blue Line to Largo received a favorable environmental impact statement thus allowing for the project to move forward. The plan represented the first expansion to the original Metro network and would include both the then named Summerfield and Largo stations. The station gained approval from Congress as part of the extension in February 2000 with the federal government contributing $259 million towards its construction.

Construction began in 2001, and by 2002 its name was changed to Morgan Boulevard as a result of the Prince George&#x27;s County Board changing the name of the street from Summerfield Boulevard to Morgan Boulevard in memory of the African-American inventor Garrett Morgan. The station opened on December 18, 2004. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail east of the Addison Road station and the opening of Largo Town Center (now ) station. The final cost of building it, its sister station and the rail extension was $456 million.

In December 2012, Morgan Boulevard was one of five stations added to the route of the Silver Line, which was originally supposed to end at the Stadium-Armory station, but was extended into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland to the Largo station (the eastern terminus of the Blue Line) due to safety concerns about a pocket track just past Stadium-Armory. Silver Line service at Morgan Boulevard began on July 26, 2014.

From March 26, 2020 until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

<doc id="664207" wikidata="Q6489288" url="?curid=664207" title="Downtown Largo station">
<text>Downtown Largo station (also known as Largo) is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Lake Arbor, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States, with a Largo postal address.

The station opened on December 18, 2004, as Largo Town Center and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). It is the eastern terminus of the Blue and Silver Lines, and serves the town of Largo and the former The Boulevard at the Capital Centre.

It is the first and so far only station in Prince George&#x27;s County outside the Capital Beltway, and is located about from Northwest Stadium, the home of the Washington Commanders. It is also a major commuter station, with two parking garages, containing a total of 2,200 spaces, connected by a bridge at the top level. This station is also the only terminus that has two lines terminating at it.

==History==
In 1980, Herbert Harris and other local legislators introduced legislation to study the feasibility of constructing an additional to the original network. Included in this request was a previously considered extension of the Blue Line through Largo en route to a proposed terminus at Bowie.

In October 1996, the proposed routing for the extension of the Blue Line to Largo received a favorable environmental impact statement thus allowing for the project to move forward. The plan represented the first expansion to the original Metro network and would include both the then named Summerfield and Largo stations. The station gained approval from Congress as part of the extension in February 2000 with the federal government contributing $259 million towards its construction.

Construction began in 2001, and the station opened as Largo Town Center on December 18, 2004 within 4 weeks after the opening of the system&#x27;s first infill station, NoMa-Gallaudet University, between Union and Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood stations. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail east of the Addison Road station and the opening of the Morgan Boulevard station. The final cost of building it, its sister station and rail extension was $456 million.

In December 2012, the station was one of five added to the route of the Silver Line, which was originally supposed to end at the Stadium–Armory station but was extended into Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland to Largo due to safety concerns about a pocket track just past Stadium–Armory. Therefore, the station is also the eastern terminus of the Silver Line, which began service on July 26, 2014.

On January 13, 2022, WMATA&#x27;s Safety and Operations Committee recommended the name of the station be changed to Downtown Largo after conducting a brief public opinion survey, despite the survey saying participants didn&#x27;t like the term &quot;Downtown&quot;. The new name became effective on September 11, 2022.

==Station Layout==
The Downtown Largo station consists of an elevated island platform station, similar in architecture to the Morgan Boulevard station one stop to the west. Track G1 is the nominal eastbound track, while G2 is the nominal westbound track. Since the station is the terminus of the G route, trains approach to whichever platform track is unused and switch onto the westbound track after departure. The station itself is flanked on both sides by a six-story parking structure, with the garage to the southeast being roughly double the size of the one to the northwest. Past the station to the northeast, tracks dip underground to connect to a 3-track train storage facility located underneath a WMATA building. Provisions exist on the elevated trackage just beyond the station to the northeast, before the tracks enter the tunnel portal, for a further elevated extension if one was ever to be built. No tracks or switches are installed, only the concrete structure for a flying junction exists. A crossover is installed just past the platform to the southwest of the station.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada is a Primary Reserve regiment of the Canadian Armed Forces, based in Toronto. The regiment is part of 4th Canadian Division&#x27;s 32 Canadian Brigade Group. It is the only reserve regiment in Canada to currently have a parachute role. The regiment consists of the reserve battalion, the Regimental Association, and the Regimental Band and Bugles. The official abbreviation is The QOR of C, but the name is often abbreviated to QOR.

The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada parade out of Moss Park Armoury in downtown Toronto. The unit motto is : in peace prepared.

== Regimental structure ==
The Reserve battalion is made up of the following companies: 
* Battalion Headquarters &amp; Signals Company
* 60th Company (Moss Park Armoury)
* Buffs Company (Moss Park Armoury)
* Parachute Company (airborne infantry)
* Victoria Company (combat support and combat service support)
* Normandy Company (training depot and battle school staff)
* Regimental Band &amp; Bugles
* Ghurka Company (training and recruitment company)

==Lineage==
*April 26, 1860 – &quot;Second Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada&quot; 
*March 18, 1863 – &quot;Second Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada or Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto&quot; 
*January 13, 1882 – &quot;2nd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot;
*May 8, 1900 – &quot;2nd Regiment Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot; 
*May 1, 1920 – &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot; 
*November 7, 1941 – &quot;2nd (Reserve) Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot;
*May 14, 1946 – &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot;

On October 16, 1953, it was amalgamated with the Regular Army &quot;1st Canadian Rifle Battalion&quot; and &quot;2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion.&quot; The 1st Canadian Rifle Battalion and 2nd Canadian Rifle Battalion became the 1st and 2nd Battalions, respectively, of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, while the Reserve component was designated as the 3rd Battalion. On September 15, 1968, the 2nd Battalion was reduced to nil strength and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle. On April 27, 1970, the 1st Battalion was reduced to nil strength and transferred to the Supplementary Order of Battle, with most of the unit&#x27;s personnel and equipment transferred to the newly formed 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), and the Reserve Force battalion automatically became the new home station of the regiment.

=== Lineage Chart ===













==Role==
The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada are the only Primary Reserve unit in Canada with a parachute tasking. The unit has qualified Parachute Instructors, Drop Zone/Landing Zone Controllers and Jumpmasters. Members also take courses in helicopter operations, aerial delivery, and as Recce and Advanced Mountain Operations Instructors. Members of The QOR have also been sent on the Patrol Pathfinder Course. Qualified personnel in jump positions are allowed the honour of wearing the maroon beret. Trained soldiers are addressed as Riflemen.

The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles have a long-standing support role with the Canadian Army Advanced Warfare Centre, where QOR parachute instructors and other personnel on staff instruct on and support parachuting courses. The unit currently supplies a company(-) of paratroopers to the 3 RCR parachute company when required.

The battalion deploys by parachute on numerous Field Training Exercises during the year and during divisional exercises during the summer.

The Canadian Forces SkyHawks Parachute Demonstration Team has also had support from The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, with several members joining the elite demonstration team.

==History==

The &quot;2nd Battalion, Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada&quot; was formed on April 26, 1860, predating the Confederation of Canada. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel William Smith Durie.

During the Trent Affair of 1862, William Mulock asked John McCaul, the head of University College (part of the University of Toronto), to call a student meeting that led to the formation of the University Rifle Company of volunteers, 9 Company of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto, later K Company of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada. University of Toronto professor Henry Holmes Croft was a member and was its captain.

It was re-designated as the &quot;Second Battalion Volunteer Militia Rifles of Canada&quot; or &quot;Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto&quot; on March 18, 1863.

The name was chosen to honour Queen Victoria.

===The Fenian Raids===
The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Toronto were called out on active service from March 8 to 31 and from June 1 to 22, 1866. The battalion fought on the Niagara frontier.
The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles first saw combat and sustained nine killed in action during the Battle of Ridgeway in 1866, where they and the 13th Volunteer Infantry Battalion (The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry) fell back when charged by a massive force of better armed and highly experienced Fenian insurgents composed of recent Irish American Civil War veterans.

It was renamed as &quot;2nd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot; on January 13, 1882.

===North-West Rebellion===
The 2nd Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada mobilized detachments for active service on April 10, 1885, that served with the Battleford Column of the North-West Field Force, and were removed from active service on July 24, 1885.

===South African War===
It was named the 2nd Regiment Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada on 8 May 1900. 
The regiment contributed volunteers for the Canadian Contingents, mainly the 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry. The Second Boer War was the first time that soldiers from the regiment fought on foreign soil. They were recognized for their service and earned a battle honour for the regiment, even though they were not allowed to wear the QOR cap badge in South Africa.

===The Great War===
Details of the regiment were placed on active service on August 6, 1914, for local protection duties.
In the First World War, none of the existing militia infantry regiments in Canada were formally mobilized. In 1914 The Queen&#x27;s Own formed the 3rd Canadian Battalion (Toronto Regiment), CEF. The 3rd Battalion, CEF was authorized on August 10, 1914, and embarked for Britain on September 26, 1914. It disembarked in France on February 11, 1915, and fought as part of the 1st Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division, in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion was disbanded on August 30, 1920.

Later in the war, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles recruited for additional Canadian Expeditionary Force battalions, which did not enter combat as units, but supplied reinforcements to the Canadian Corps.

The 83rd Battalion (Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) was authorized on July 10, 1915, and embarked for Britain on April 28, 1916. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until July 7, 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was subsequently disbanded on May 21, 1917.

The 95th Battalion (Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) was authorized on December 22, 1915, and embarked for Britain on May 31, 1916. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until January 24, 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the 5th Reserve Battalion, CEF, and was disbanded on July 17, 1917.

The 166th Battalion (Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) was authorized on December 22, 1915, and embarked for Britain on October 12 and 17, 1916. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until January 8, 1917, when its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was disbanded on September 15, 1917.

The 198th Battalion (Canadian Buffs) was authorized on July 15, 1916, and embarked for Britain on March 28, 1917. It provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until March 9, 1918, when its personnel were absorbed by the 3rd Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion was then disbanded on November 29, 1918.

The 255th Battalion (Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada) was authorized on May 1, 1917, and embarked for Britain on June 6, 1917. On June 12, 1917, its personnel were absorbed by the 12th Reserve Battalion, CEF to provide reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field. The battalion was disbanded on September 1, 1917.

The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles have perpetuated the traditions and battle honours of the 3rd Battalion, 83rd Battalion, 95th Battalion, 166th Battalion, 198th Battalion, and 255th Battalion, CEF. Both the QOR and The Royal Regiment of Canada perpetuate the 3rd Battalion.

===Between the wars===
It was designated &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada&quot; on May 1, 1920.

===The Second World War===
The regiment mobilized for active service on May 24, 1940. It was then redesignated as the &quot;1st Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, CASF&quot; on November 7, 1940. The unit served in Newfoundland (at the time a separate Dominion) in the defence of two strategic airfields at Botwood and Gander in Newfoundland from August 10 to December 15, 1940. After a build-up and training period, the unit embarked for Britain on July 19, 1941. 
The regiment mobilized the &quot;3rd Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, CASF&quot; for active service on May 12, 1942. It served in Canada in a home defence role as part of the 20th Infantry Brigade, 7th Canadian Infantry Division. The battalion was disbanded on August 15, 1943.

For the Invasion of Normandy, the regiment landed in Normandy, France, as part of the 8th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.
The first major combat operations were on D-day June 6, 1944. The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles landed on &quot;Nan&quot; sector of Juno Beach and with the support of tanks of the Fort Garry Horse captured the strategic seaside resort town of Bernières-sur-Mer. The battalion fought its way to its D-Day objective – the village of Anisy inland, the only regiment to reach its assigned objective that day. The QOR had the highest casualties amongst the Canadian regiments, with 143 killed, wounded or captured. As well as losses in the initial landing, the reserve companies&#x27; landing craft struck mines as they approached the beach.

In the battle for Caen, the QOR – as part of the 8th Infantry Brigade – participated in Operation Windsor to capture the airfield at Carpiquet which was defended by a detachment from the &quot;12th SS Panzer-Division Hitler Jugend&quot;. The Germans inflicted heavy casualties and Panzer-grenadiers attempted to recapture the village.

During the war, 463 riflemen were killed in action and almost 900 were wounded as they fought through Normandy, Northern France, and into Belgium and the Netherlands, where they liberated the crucial Channel ports. Sixty more members of the regiment were killed while serving with other units in Hong Kong, Italy and northwest Europe. The overseas battalion was disbanded on November 30, 1945.

On June 1, 1945, a third Active Force battalion, designated the &quot;4th Battalion, The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, CIC, CAOF&quot;, was mobilized for service with the Canadian Army Occupation Force in Germany. The battalion was disbanded on May 14, 1946.

In October 1953, the status of the regiment was upgraded, and it was made a part of the Regular Force. The regiment consisted of two Regular Force battalions and the Reserve (Third) battalion in Toronto until 1968. There was also a regimental depot in Calgary.

===Korea===
The 2nd Battalion, commanded by LCol W.H.V. Matthews, served in Korea following the armistice from 26 March 54 to April 6, 1955.

The following members of the 2nd Battalion died in Korea:

*Rifleman Norman Philip Ferland, March 31, 1954.
*Lt Neil MacDonald Anderson, August 25, 1954.
*Sgt Gerald Walter Koch, August 4, 1954.
*Lt Milton Cameron Vipond March 18, 1955.
*Rifleman George Peter Reid, June 11, 1955.

Maj. Philip Edwin Gower, MC, died on December 9, 1956, while serving with the United Nations Command Military Assistance Commission.
As part of the Regular Force, the unit was involved in the Korean War.

===Cold War===
The Regular Force battalions served on NATO duty in Germany and served on UN duty in Cyprus.

In 1963, the 1st Battalion QOR of C was relocated from Currie Barracks in Calgary to Work Point Barracks at Esquimalt Garrison, replacing the 1st Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry, which was deployed to West Germany.
In 1970, with the downsizing of the Canadian Forces, the 1st Battalion of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada was rebadged as the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry.

From 1983 to 1995, the regiment was operationally tasked to provide an airborne company to the Canadian Airborne Regiment.

Members of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada have served on recent overseas deployments including: UNTAG (United Nations Transition Assistance Group) Namibia 1989–1990, Cambodia, Cyprus, Somalia (for Operation Deliverance 1992–1993 members were attached to 1, 2 and 3 Commando of the Canadian Airborne Regiment), Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Darfur and Sudan.

The unit played a large role in the purchase of the Victoria Cross of Corporal Frederick George Topham in 2005 and its subsequent donation to the Canadian War Museum.

On April 22, 2006, The QOR of C opened Dalton Armoury in Scarborough as part of the Land Force Reserve Restructure expansion. Buffs Company parades out of Dalton Armoury. In September 1910, the QOR went on a route march with The Buffs (East Kent) Regiment of the British Army. It was noted that the Buffs and QOR used the same regimental march, a tune known as &quot;The Regimental Quick Step of the Buffs&quot; composed for The Buffs by Handel. A regimental alliance was made official in 1914.

The Cross of Sacrifice outside the church is dedicated to the members of the QOR who have died in combat. It was built and dedicated after the First World War.

The Books of Remembrance are a list of the names of the QOR dead, and are in the interior of the church. The books are displayed annually on Remembrance Day Sunday, when the regiment parades to St. Paul&#x27;s to attend services.

==Memorials==

The most recent is the regimental badge carved on the back of one of the pews of the Royal Memorial Chapel at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

A sandstone monument with Italian marble figures and bronze plaques erected on the University of Toronto Campus was dedicated to those of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada regiment who were killed in action or who died from wounds defending her frontier in June 1866. The monument was erected by the Canadian Volunteer Monument Campaign of 1866, Committee of Toronto citizens and its chairman, Dr. McCaul, then President of the University of Toronto.

The North-West Rebellion of 1885 is remembered by the North-West Rebellion Monument in Queen&#x27;s Park (east side of Queen&#x27;s park Crescent), the Battleford Column tablet inside Moss Park Armoury and a cairn at Battleford, Saskatchewan.

The South African War memorial is on University Avenue. An additional tablet is inside Denison Armoury.

The First World War is commemorated by the Cross of Sacrifice and the shrine containing the Book of Remembrance at St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church. In addition, a tablet is mounted at Moss Park Armoury. The QOR dead are also remembered in The Buffs Memorial window, Warrior&#x27;s Chapel, of Canterbury Cathedral.

A plaque was erected to the dead of the Second World War at the site of the D-Day landing, Bernières-sur-Mer, Normandy, France.

A tablet was also placed on a farm building at Mooshof, Germany, where Sergeant Aubrey Cosens, VC, earned his decoration.

<text>The camp meeting is a form of Protestant Christian religious service originating in England and Scotland as an evangelical event in association with the communion season. It was held for worship, preaching and communion on the American frontier during the Second Great Awakening of the early 19th century. Revivals and camp meetings continued to be held by various denominations, and in some areas of the mid-Atlantic, led to the development of seasonal cottages for meetings. 

Originally camp meetings were held in frontier areas, where people without regular preachers would travel on occasion from a large region to a particular site to camp, pray, sing hymns, and listen to itinerant preachers at the tabernacle. Camp meetings offered community, often singing and other music, sometimes dancing, and diversion from work. The practice was a major component of the Second Great Awakening, an evangelical movement promoted by Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian and other preachers in the early 19th century. Certain denominations took the lead in different geographic areas.

As with brush arbor revivals and tent revivals, camp meetings today are often held annually at campgrounds owned by a Christian denomination.

==Background==
The camp meeting is a phenomenon of American frontier Christianity, as well as British Christianity, but with strong roots in traditional practices of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland and the United States. Scots and Scots-Irish predominated in many parts of the frontier at this time, and had brought their familiar Presbyterian communion season practices with them. Barton W. Stone and Alexander Campbell, two leading ministers of the later Restoration Movement of the 1830s, had each been ordained as Presbyterian ministers and served for several years in that role, leading preaching at numerous meetings.

The movement of thousands of settlers to new territories without permanent villages of the types they knew meant they were without religious communities. Not only were there few authorized houses of worship, there were fewer ordained ministers to fill the pulpits. The &quot;camp meeting&quot; led by itinerant preachers was an innovative response to this situation. Word of mouth told there was to be a religious meeting at a certain location. Due to the primitive means of transportation, if the meeting was to be more than a few miles&#x27; distance from the homes of those attending, they would need to stay at the revival for its entire duration, or as long as they desired to remain. People generally camped out at or near the revival site, as on the frontier there were usually neither adequate accommodations nor the funds for frontier families to use them. People were attracted to large camp meetings from a wide area. Some came out of sincere religious devotion or interest, others out of curiosity and a desire for a break from the arduous frontier routine; the structure of the situation often resulted in new converts.
Freed from daily routines for the duration of the meeting, participants could take part in almost continuous services, which resulted in high emotions; once one speaker was finished (often after several hours), another would often rise to take his place. 
Lee Sandlin gave an overview of the typical camp meeting in frontier America:
Sandlin&#x27;s commentary is a provocative opinion piece compared to the less sensationalist descriptions by those better qualified to write about the event, such as Colonel Robert Patterson, who had been involved in the settlement of Kentucky practically from the beginning. He had described with amazement the religious phenomena taking place during the sequence of meetings. His description of the Cane Ridge Revival, taken from a letter to the Rev. Doctor John King on September 25, 1801, is memorable:

Patterson tried, &quot;as well as I am able&quot;, to describe the emotion. 
Patterson went on to describe other manifestations which lasted from &quot;one hour to 24&quot;, and continued:
Revivalism had been a significant force in religion since the 1740s and the First Great Awakening, but in the days of the camp meeting, &quot;revivalism became the dominant religious culture.&quot; These sorts of meetings contributed greatly to what became known as the Second Great Awakening. A particularly large and successful revival was held at Cane Ridge, Kentucky in 1801, led by some ministers later active in what became the Restoration Movement. Some scholars suggest that this was the pioneering event in the history of frontier camp meetings in America. What made camp meetings successful and multiply quite rapidly &quot;were their emphases upon revivalism and morality, de-emphasis upon formal theology, clergy sharing the worldview of the frontier dwellers, and respect for common people.

Frost summarizes: &quot;Camp-meeting religion reinforced older themes of revivalism, including a sense of cooperation among the denominations, all of which confronted individual sinners with the necessity of making a decision to be converted.&quot;

In the early 1800s in what is now Toronto, Ohio, members of the Sugar Grove Methodist Episcopal Church with the assistance of circuit preachers began a series of camp meetings in the surrounding area. One such meeting, first being held out of the home of a local family, has met annually in Hollow Rock Run since it was formally organized as a Methodist camp in 1818 while continuing to use the family&#x27;s farm land. In 1875 at the urging of prominent clergy and members, the camp meeting became interdenominational through the formation of the Hollow Rock Holiness Camp Meeting Association and its leasing and eventual purchase of the land. The association, which still operates the camp, notes that it is the oldest Christian camp meeting in continual existence in the United States, being supported by various denominations in the Wesleyan-Holiness tradition.

Another camp gathering area, known now as the Campgrounds, was located in present-day Merrick, New York. Parishioners arrived by wagon, parking them in two concentric circles. Eventually some started building small seasonal cottages, which offered more comfort than the wagons for repeated use. A chapel and a house for the minister were also built. In the 1920s, with new areas open to those with cars, people stopped using the campground. The cottages and church buildings were adapted as local, permanent residences, and most survive today. The two roads, Wesley and Fletcher avenues, encompass the area of the original paths which the wagons would encircle. The area is also known as Tiny Town because of the small size of the original cottages.

In the aftermath of the American Civil War, such evangelical camp meetings gained wide recognition and a substantial increase in popularity as a result of a holiness movement camp meeting in Vineland, New Jersey in 1867. In the mid-Atlantic states, the Methodist Church led many of these camp meetings and established semi-permanent sites for summer seasons. Ocean Grove, New Jersey, founded in 1869, has been called the &quot;Queen of the Victorian Methodist Camp Meetings.&quot; Similar areas include Cape May Point, New Jersey, with others in Maryland and New York. At the end of the nineteenth century, believers in Spiritualism also established camp meetings throughout the United States.

Camp meetings in the United States continued to be conducted on a wide scale for many years . Some are still held in the 21st century, primarily by Methodist (including churches affiliated with the holiness movement) and Pentecostal groups, as well as other Protestants, such as Baptists and Presbyterians. Some scholars consider the revival meeting a form that arose to recreate the spirit of the frontier camp meeting.

The Balls Creek Campground camp meeting was established in 1853 and is believed to be one of the largest religious campgrounds in the southern United States. Other sites of Methodist camp meetings in North Carolina are the Chapel Hill Church Tabernacle, Center Arbor, and Pleasant Grove Camp Meeting Ground (1830).

==Music and hymn singing==
The camp meeting tradition fostered a tradition of music and hymn singing with strong oral, improvisatory, and spontaneous elements.

Hymns were taught and learned by rote, and a spontaneous and improvisatory element was prized. Both tunes and words were created, changed, and adapted in true folk music fashion:

Specialists in nineteenth-century American religious history describe camp meeting music as the creative product of participants who, when seized by the spirit of a particular sermon or prayer, would take lines from a preacher&#x27;s text as a point of departure for a short, simple melody. The melody was either borrowed from a preexisting tune or made up on the spot. The line would be sung repeatedly, changing slightly each time, and shaped gradually into a stanza that could be learned easily by others and memorized quickly.

Spontaneous song became a marked characteristic of the camp meetings. Rough and irregular couplets or stanzas were concocted out of Scripture phrases and every-day speech, with liberal interspersing of Hallelujahs and refrains. Such ejaculatory hymns were frequently started by an excited auditor during the preaching, and taken up by the throng, until the meeting dissolved into a &quot;singing-ecstasy&quot; culminating in general hand-shaking. Sometimes they were given forth by a preacher, who had a sense of rhythm, under the excitement of his preaching and the agitation of his audience. Hymns were also composed more deliberately out of meeting, and taught to the people or lined out from the pulpit.

Collections of camp meeting hymns were published, which served both to propagate tunes and texts that were commonly used, and to document the most commonly sung tunes and texts. Example hymnals include &quot;The Pilgrams&#x27; songster; or, A choice collection of spiritual songs&quot; (1828), &quot;The Camp-meeting Chorister&quot; (1830) and &quot;The Golden Harp&quot; (1857)

Many of these songs were republished in shape note songbooks such as A Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony (1820), the Sacred Harp (1844), and dozens of other publications; they can typically be distinguished by the reuse and re-arrangement of certain lines of lyrics from other songs, re-set to a new melody and sometimes containing new lyrics. Many of these camp songs are also set in a &quot;call and response&quot; format, typically, every line of lyric is followed by the words &quot;&quot;Glory Hallelujah&quot;!&quot; (although this varies, and other phrases or combinations can be used as well), which allows for easy audience participation in their original format, as the audience can call back the response even if they do not know the lyrics of the song itself. For example, the tune &quot;Antioch 277&quot; from the Sacred Harp reads:

&lt;poem&gt;I know that my Redeemer lives, Glory, Hallelujah!
What comfort this sweet sentence gives, Glory Hallelujah!
Shout on, pray on, we&#x27;re gaining ground, Glory Hallelujah!
The dead&#x27;s alive and the lost is found, Glory Hallelujah!
(F.C. Wood, 1850)&lt;/poem&gt;

The 20th-century American composer Charles Ives used the camp meeting phenomenon as a metaphysical basis for his Symphony No. 3 (Ives). He incorporated hymn tunes and American Civil War-era popular songs (which are closely related to camp meeting songs) as part of the symphony&#x27;s musical material. The piece was not premiered until 1946, almost 40 years after its composition, and the symphony was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1947.

== Practice by denomination ==
=== Anabaptism ===
The Dunkard Brethren Church, a denomination of Conservative Anabaptist Christianity, holds its annual camp meeting at Roxbury Holiness Camp.
=== Methodism ===
Francis Asbury, the first bishop of the American Methodist Episcopal Church, was a staunch supporter of camp meetings. At Methodist camp meetings, which continue to occur today:
Throughout the United States, several camp meeting facilities were founded, many of which remain operational to this day. For example, the Balls Creek Campground is a popular Methodist camp meeting that was formed in 1853. In 1869, the Ocean Grove Camp-Meeting Association was founded, running a popular Methodist camp meeting at Ocean Grove, New Jersey. Methodists flocked to the area, especially around major feasts of the Church, such as during Christmastide. Sunday Sabbatarian principles were practiced, with swimming being forbidden on the Lord&#x27;s Day, as well as the gates to the city being locked on that day. Ocean Grove &quot;prohibited other activities deemed not consonant with Christian living--dancing, cardplaying, and the sale of liquor.&quot;

On Sunday, 31 May 1807, the first Camp Meeting was held in England at Mow Cop. At the time, Wesleyan Methodists disapproved and subsequently expelled Hugh Bourne &quot;because you have a tendency to set up other than the ordinary worship.&quot;. He eventually formed the Primitive Methodist Church. The Wesleyan Methodist Church and the Primitive Methodist Church in Great Britain later reunited to form the Methodist Church of Great Britain).

During his visits to England, Lorenzo Dow brought reports of North American camp meetings. Hugh Bourne, William Clowes and Daniel Shoebotham saw this as an answer to complaints from members of the Harriseahead Methodists that their weeknight prayer meeting was too short. Bourne also saw these as an antidote to the general debauchery of the Wakes week in that part of the Staffordshire Potteries, one of the reasons why he continued organising camp meetings in spite of the opposition from the Wesleyan authorities.

The pattern of the Primitive Methodist camp meeting was as a time of prayer and preaching from the Bible. In the first camp meeting, four separate &quot;preaching stations&quot; had been set up by the afternoon, each with an audience, while in between others spent the time praying.

From May 1807 to the establishing of Primitive Methodism as a denomination in 1811, a series of 17 camp meetings was held. There were a number of different venues beyond Mow Cop, including Norton-in-the-Moors during the Wakes in 1807 (Bourne&#x27;s target venue), and Ramsor in 1808.

After Bourne and a significant number of his colleagues, including the Standley Methodist Society, had been put out of membership of the Burslem Wesleyan Circuit, they formed a group known as the Camp Meeting Methodists until 1811. That year they joined with the followers of William Clowes, known as the &quot;Clowesites&quot;.

Camp meetings were a regular feature of Primitive Methodist life throughout the 19th century, and still survive today. The annual late May Bank Holiday weekend meetings at Cliff College are one example. A number of tents are set up around the site, each featuring a different preacher.

The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection holds its camp meetings annually at Methodist Camp in Stoneboro, Pennsylvania. Each conference of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches owns land on which its camp meetings are held each year. The Primitive Methodist Church also has camp meetings in its districts. Many United Methodist churches also hold yearly camp meetings, such as the Shiloh United Methodist Church Camp Meeting, Northport Indian United Methodist Church and Trinity United Methodist Camp Meeting, for example. Many Free Methodist churches hold camp meetings every year, such as those that take place at the Tri-State Free Methodist Campground.

=== Presbyterianism ===
In 1825, the Presbytery of Hopewell established a network of camp meetings.

The Smyrna Presbyterian Church, a congregation of the Presbyterian Church (USA) continues to hold an annual camp meeting at its Camp Smyrna. The Red River Meeting House, belonging to the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, also has a yearly camp meeting.

==Disuse and Adaptation==
A number of camp meeting grounds have fallen into disuse or diverged from their original use and ownership. These include Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, founded as a Methodist camp meeting in 1873 and now a beach resort town. Its temperance fountain remains. Old Orchard Beach, Maine, similarly became a seaside resort.

<text>Minnesota Avenue station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in the Central Northeast/Mahaning Heights neighborhood of Northeast Washington, D.C., United States. The station was opened on November 20, 1978, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).

On the Orange Line&#x27;s westbound service, Minnesota Ave is the last station before crossing the Anacostia River, as well as the last above-ground station until East Falls Church in Virginia. West of the station, trains curve over RFK Stadium parking lots before descending underground.

==Location==
Minnesota Avenue station is located between Kenilworth Avenue and Minnesota Avenue, at Grant Street, immediately east of the CSX Landover Subdivision rail bed. The station is an east-Washington commuter station with a small parking lot and many Metrobuses serving the east side of the city from here. It is also southwest of the historic western terminus of the Chesapeake Beach Railway.

==History==
The station opened on November 20, 1978. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northeast of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Cheverly, Deanwood, Landover, and New Carrollton stations.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. New Carrollton station was closed from May 28, 2022, through September 5, 2022, as part of the summer platform improvement project, which also affected the Minnesota Avenue, Deanwood, Cheverly, and Landover stations on the Orange Line. Shuttle buses and free parking were provided at the closed stations.

On September 10, 2022, Blue Line trains started serving the station due to the 14th Street bridge shutdown as a part of the Blue Plus service. The service ended on May 7, 2023 with the reopening of the Yellow Line.

==Station Layout==
The Minnesota Avenue station consists of an at-grade island platform situated between CSX freight track tracks, built on unneeded land within the existing right-of-way. The station fare gates and mezzanine exist in a basement level underneath the south end of the platform, with entrances from both sides of the right-of-way. A bus bay exists outside of the southeast exit, located between Minnesota Avenue itself and the station entrance.

<text>The Buttonwood Agreement is the founding document of what is now the New York Stock Exchange and is one of the most important financial documents in U.S. history. The agreement organized securities trading in New York City and was signed on May 17, 1792 between 24 stockbrokers outside of 68 Wall Street. According to legend the signing took place under a buttonwood tree where their earliest transactions had occurred. The New York Stock Exchange celebrates the signing of this agreement on May 17, 1792 as its founding.

==History==
In March 1792, twenty-four of New York&#x27;s leading merchants met secretly at Corre&#x27;s Hotel to discuss ways to bring order to the securities business. Two months later, on May 17, 1792, the group signed a document called the Buttonwood Agreement, named after their traditional meeting place under a buttonwood tree – not because it was signed there.

There were too many brokers involved to meet under a tree. Business was conducted in various offices and coffee houses. In 1793, they coordinated their business inside the Tontine Coffee House on the corner of Wall and Water streets.

The document is now part of the archival collection of the New York Stock Exchange.

==Document agreement==
In brief, the agreement had two provisions: 1) the brokers were to deal only with each other, thereby eliminating the auctioneers, and 2) the commissions were to be 0.25%. It reads as follows:

<text>Cheverly station is a side-platformed Washington Metro station in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on November 20, 1978, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for the Orange Line, the station is the first station going east in Maryland on the Orange Line. The station is in the residential area of Cheverly at Columbia Park Road near U.S. Route 50. It is a commuter station with 530 parking spaces.

Cheverly had the lowest average weekday ridership of any Metro station until the opening of Loudoun Gateway in 2022 as part of Phase 2 of the Silver Line.

==History==
The station opened on November 20, 1978. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northeast of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Deanwood, Landover, Minnesota Avenue, and New Carrollton stations.

From March 26, 2020, until June 28, 2020, this station was closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. New Carrollton station was closed from May 28, 2022, through September 5, 2022, as part of the summer platform improvement project, which also affected the Minnesota Avenue, Deanwood, Cheverly, and Landover stations on the Orange Line. Shuttle buses and free parking were provided at the closed stations.

On September 10, 2022, Blue Line trains started serving the station due to the 14th Street bridge shutdown as a part of the Blue Plus service. The service ended on May 7, 2023 with the reopening of the Yellow Line.

==Station layout==
The Cheverly station consists of dual at-grade side platforms located between the Northeast Corridor to the north and CSX tracks to the south. Access to the station is from the south, with a bus bay and parking lots off of Columbia Park Road. Fare gates and other station infrastructure such as platform access and ticket machines are located within an elevated bridge passing over the CSX and Metro tracks, with the only entrance being to the south of the station.

<doc id="664226" wikidata="Q4546200" url="?curid=664226" title="100 episodes">
<text>In the U.S. television industry, 100 episodes is the traditional threshold for a television series to enter syndicated reruns. One hundred episodes are advantageous for stripped syndication because it allows for 20 weeks of weekday reruns (depending on the number of episodes produced once the program debuts in syndication) without repeating an episode, and such shows can be sold for higher per-episode pricing.

One of the first series made specifically for syndication, the 1953–1955 sitcom &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot;, purposely ended its run after only 65 episodes, concerned that producing more would saturate the market and reduce the syndication package&#x27;s value. In recent years, the minimum number of episodes for off-network, stripped syndication has been set at 88 (typically four seasons of 22 episodes), although some programs have been relatively successful in syndication with fewer episodes. &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, for instance, only aired 75 episodes.

==Overview==
Syndication is often a profitable enterprise because a series can be rerun for years after it ends production. Shows of limited profitability during their first run will still prove to be viable to the production company if they can last 100 episodes. This point is usually reached during a series&#x27; fifth season.

Shows that have produced fewer episodes have become syndication successes, in some cases prompting additional episodes to be commissioned specifically for syndication to reach the 100-episode mark. &quot;WKRP in Cincinnati&quot; was a major success in syndication despite having only produced 90 episodes, eventually prompting 47 additional episodes to be produced a decade after the original ended. &quot;The Monkees&quot;, a show that lasted only 58 episodes and two seasons, went on to be rerun extensively in the decades that followed, with interest in the series being revived in the 1980s when the series was rerun on cable. &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; was a series spun off in 1955–1956 from sketches of the same name that aired on &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;, an hour-long variety program (1952–1955). While only 39 episodes of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; were produced, there were enough &quot;Honeymooners&quot; sketches from &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot; (which ran again in the 1956–1957 season and would be revived in the 1960s) to compile a syndication package with over 100 episodes. &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; was put into syndication despite having only 35 episodes at the time of its cancellation; the surprise success of the show in summer reruns and syndication prompted the syndicator to rush the show back into production, which led to an additional 95 episodes aired over four seasons in first-run syndication. &quot;The Munsters&quot; also was put into syndication despite running for two seasons, but with 70 episodes; the series became popular in reruns to the point that an updated version of the series was produced in the late 1980s and early 1990s with an entirely new cast and 72 episodes over three seasons.

More recently, &quot;Clueless&quot; had reasonable success in syndication, especially on cable, even though only 62 episodes had been produced by the time the series ended in 1999. &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; entered syndication despite only producing 33 episodes, five of which were clip shows. Series which have entered the public domain, such as &quot;Dusty&#x27;s Trail&quot;, &quot;Meet Corliss Archer&quot;, and &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; are sometimes aired regardless of the number of episodes because there is no licensing fee.

Dramas, which do not require daily runs, have also had success in syndication with shorter runs. For example, &quot;Lost in Space&quot; ceased production in 1968 after 84 episodes because of declining ratings, but did well in syndication for a number of years. The original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series had only 79 episodes available when its network run ended in 1969, but after its considerable success in syndication, it spawned multiple feature films and more than six spin-off series. Other examples include &quot;The Prisoner&quot; and &quot;Hondo&quot;, both successfully syndicated for more than 30 years despite having only 17 episodes produced. The original 1978 series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Galactica 1980&quot; produced a combined 34 episodes, yet it not only remains in syndication but it also led to a 2003 reimagining that lasted for 75 episodes. In 2014, AMC released &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; for reruns on MyNetworkTV after 51 episodes had aired; that series was still in production at the time, and MyNetworkTV airs its shows once a week instead of in a daily strip.

The growth of cable and satellite television has prompted channels to rerun series more often, with fewer episodes. Reruns of a particular show may air multiple times a day, several days a week, despite having only one or two seasons of episodes produced.

By the early 2010s, the milestone for syndication was accepted at 88 episodes, which is typically reached after four seasons. Shows approaching the 88-episode target are often renewed despite low ratings in order to ensure syndication. Production companies can offer discounts on licensing fees to the networks to encourage renewal. Shows that are approaching the 88-episode syndication milestone while suffering from poor ratings are often moved to graveyard slots on Friday or Saturday in order to burn off remaining episodes. By the end of that decade, with the rise of subscription video on demand services and different funding models which make continuing series more expensive, the threshold for a series to be profitable in syndication has been dropped even lower to 50 episodes. It was noted in 2024 that no American series that had been originally made for streaming television had ever reached the 100 episode threshold. &quot;Lucifer&quot; had 36 episodes produced for Netflix in order to be viable for syndication and basic cable after Fox had canceled the series after 57 episodes.

An extreme example of a show renewed primarily for syndication purposes was &quot;&#x27;Til Death&quot;, which was pulled from Fox&#x27;s lineup just seven episodes into its third season, after it had fallen out of the top 100 in the primetime ratings. Cancellation seemed imminent, but the show was renewed for a fourth season after Sony Pictures Entertainment offered Fox a discount on the licensing fee. Unaired episodes from the third season were broadcast alongside fourth season episodes from October 2009 through June 2010 (a total of 37 episodes), including four new episodes airing in a Christmas Day &quot;marathon&quot; and two new episodes being scheduled against Super Bowl XLIV with the knowledge that these episodes would have minuscule ratings. The overlapped seasons led to some comical confusion, because four different actresses played the part of Allison Stark during this span of episodes. The show eventually reached 81 episodes, and debuted in off-network syndication in the fall of 2011.

==Niche genres==
The 100-episode threshold is generally applied solely to scripted prime time programming, since sitcoms and dramas are the most prevalent in syndicated reruns. Other programming may follow different patterns. For example, the traditional syndication model seldom works for most reality shows, and both annual and semi-annual contests have also been a relative failure in syndication.

===Game shows===
On rare occasions, game shows have been rerun on broadcast television. Despite having very high output as far as numbers of episodes (a typical 13-week run of even an unsuccessful game show yielded 65 episodes) are concerned, most networks instead opted to recycle the tapes of those shows, as it was viewed at the time as a more profitable practice than trying to sell reruns of daytime programming. The practice of rerunning some of the most popular game shows in syndication was rare, but not unheard of, in the 1970s and 1980s; &quot;Gambit&quot; was rerun in 1978 and &quot;Match Game&quot; was rerun in syndication in 1985. In addition, &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; was rerun by NBC between September 1991 and the summer of 1993. &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which have produced thousands of episodes over their runs of 35 or more years in syndication as of 2019, offers a package of reruns (with the former using the title &quot;Daytime Jeopardy!&quot;) as companion series for stations with an extra time slot.

With the advent of cable channels such as Game Show Network, the subchannel network Buzzr, and advertising-supported linear video services such as Pluto TV, rerunning game shows has become more common; for instance, &quot;Merv Griffin&#x27;s Crosswords&quot;, which lasted one season and 225 episodes in syndication during the 2007-08 season, ran continuously for several years thereafter, originally in syndication and later on RTV. GSN has rerun several game shows that ran less than 100 episodes, including &quot;Greed&quot; (44 episodes), &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (26 episodes), &quot;Power of 10&quot; (18 episodes), and perhaps the most extreme case, &quot;Million Dollar Password&quot;, which ran for only 12 episodes. Even among shows with hundreds (and even thousands) of episodes, since the early 2010s, GSN typically has only acquired the rights to 50 to 65 episodes at a time for most series. Rerunning game shows has proven to be successful; Stirr, the free over-the-top service run by Sinclair Broadcast Group, stated that Buzzr was the service&#x27;s most popular nationwide channel. Pluto TV and The Roku Channel have launched 24-hour linear channels devoted to individual game shows, a trend that began with &quot;The Price Is Right: The Barker Era&quot; in December 2020 and since expanded to other game shows. A dedicated channel generally requires more than 100 episodes for optimal rotation, since a series of that length will begin repeating within less than three days; Pluto&#x27;s &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; channel, &quot;Jeopardy! Hosted by Alex Trebek&quot;, initially used a 250-episode package before expanding to 500 episodes in 2023.

===Cartoons and children&#x27;s programming===
Rerunning children&#x27;s programming generally requires fewer episodes than programming for adults. For most children&#x27;s series, reruns are aired for a short period of time after the series finishes production, then are replaced. For weekly series, this practice dates to at least the 1960s, when Saturday morning cartoons would, after the end of their 13-week run, begin rerunning continuously for about a year (usually four runs/year) until being replaced by the next show, either new or archival. During the 1970s, 22 episodes was typically the number a producer sought in order for an animated program to be rerun beyond its first year. After several years, once the previous generation of children outgrew the show, it could be reintroduced for the next younger generation by airing reruns. For shows that are rerun daily, the time span is usually on the order of months. This also meant that cancellations of children&#x27;s programming was extremely rare; because of the long lead time to produce a cartoon, networks usually bought a full season of a show before it began airing, meaning that it would be far too late to have any appreciable financial benefit by ending it.

It was noted in a study that when the animated series &quot;Robotech&quot; aired in 1985, daily strip syndication for a series for children required 65 episodes at minimum. Until the mid-2000s, the Disney Channel notably stuck to a 65-episode limit—which allows for four series to be shown every weekday for a year—until &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was renewed to end at 100 episodes.

<doc id="664230" wikidata="Q1456785" url="?curid=664230" title="Rhythm section">
<text>A rhythm section is a group of musicians within a music ensemble or band that provides the underlying rhythm, harmony and pulse of the accompaniment, providing a rhythmic and harmonic reference and &quot;beat&quot; for the rest of the band.
The rhythm section is often contrasted with the roles of other musicians in the band, such as the lead guitarist or lead vocals whose primary job is to carry the melody.

The core elements of the rhythm section are usually the drum kit and bass. The drums and bass provide the basic pulse and groove of a song.
The section is augmented by other instruments such as keyboard instruments and guitars that are used to play the chord progression upon which the song is based.
The bass instrument (either double bass, or electric bass guitar, or another low-register instrument such as the synth bass, depending on the group and its style of music) plays the low-pitched bassline. The bassline is a musical part that supports the chord progression, typically by playing a musically interesting bassline that outlines the important notes of the harmony, often by emphasizing the root, fifth, and third of each chord.

The term is common in modern small musical ensembles, such as bands that play jazz, country, blues, and rock. Orchestras that play popular music, film soundtracks (often called a &quot;pops orchestra&quot;), or musical theatre orchestras may also feature a rhythm section (at a minimum drum kit and electric bass/amplified double bass, but possibly including keyboards and guitar) that performs with the larger ensemble. The rhythm section provides a rock or pop feel and sounds that would be difficult to recreate with orchestral instruments.

== Instruments ==

A typical rhythm section comprises one or more guitars (either electric guitars, in rock music bands; acoustic guitars, in country music, folk music and blues or both electric and acoustic in some bands); and/or a keyboard instrument (piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, synthesizer, etc.) a double bass, an acoustic bass guitar, or an electric bass guitar (depending on the style of music), and drums (usually acoustic, but in some post-1980s styles, the drums may be electronic drums).

In some styles of music, there may be additional percussionists playing instruments such as the djembe or shakers. Some styles of music often have two electric guitarists, such as rock genres like heavy metal music and punk rock. Some styles of music use multiple keyboard instrument performers simultaneously (e.g., piano and Hammond organ or electric piano and synthesizer) for a fuller sound.
A rhythm section could be as small as two or three instruments (e.g., a guitarist and a bassist or a power trio of bass, drums and guitar) or it may be a fairly large ensemble with several keyboardists, several guitarists, auxiliary string players (mandolin, ukulele, etc.), a drummer and percussionists.

The largest rhythm sections may be led by a bandleader or a conductor who indicates the tempo of each song, starts each song, leads slow-downs of the music at cadences (sections of songs where the music comes to rest on a chord), and indicates when to change soloists and how and when the song will end.

The instrumentalists used in a rhythm section vary according to the style of music and era. Modern pop, rock and jazz band rhythm sections typically consist of a drummer, a bass player, and one or more players of chordal instruments (e.g., a pianist, guitarist, etc.). The term &quot;rhythm section&quot; may also refer to the instruments in this group (named collectively the &quot;rhythm section instruments&quot;).

Klezmer bands rarely have percussion, but rely heavily on a bass instrument, often brass, and a piano or accordion.
Traditional dance music bands from Central and Eastern Europe often build their rhythm section around a double bass and viola - the musician designated with the German term &quot;Bratscher&quot;.

In music industry parlance, the amplifiers and some of the instruments are nicknamed the &quot;backline.&quot; Backline instruments are commonly provided for bands at music festivals and other concerts where several bands will play during an event.
By providing these backline instruments, the changeover process is quickened when new bands take the stage.
The backline typically includes large and heavy items that are hard to transport, including large bass amplifiers and guitar amplifiers and their speaker cabinets, the drum kit (usually minus the cymbals and the snare drum, which each drummer brings from home), a Hammond organ, stage piano, and a keyboard amplifier.

Even when a venue or festival provides a backline amplification, musicians must still supply some instruments themselves, such as guitars, an electric bass, and in some cases the cymbals and/or the snare drum.
The venue informs musicians about which instruments are supplied as the backline for a specific concert or stage and in many cases, the contract signed by the band and the venue/promoter contains an explicit list of the backline gear that will be on stage, even specifying brand names and model numbers.

== Roles ==

In modern rock music, a rhythm guitarist specializes in rhythmic and chordal playing (as opposed to the melodic guitar solos and lead melody lines played by the lead guitar), often repeating quaver (eighth-note), half note or whole note chords. In the louder genres, such as hard rock, heavy metal, and punk rock, rhythm guitarists often play power chords with distortion. Rhythm guitarists often strum open chords in pop, rock, country, and folk music and play barre chords in many pop and rock styles.

Although rhythm sections spend much of the time providing accompaniment (backing parts) for songs, in some cases they provide other musical roles. In some songs or styles of music, instruments from the rhythm section may play soloistic roles on occasion (e.g., improvised guitar solos or solo breaks) or play a melodic role (e.g., a rhythm guitarist may play a lyrical countermelody behind a singer or a melodic intro line before the lead vocalist starts to sing). Since rhythm sections generally provide the background music for lead instruments and solo singers, rhythm sections are typically not as prominent as a singer or soloist. However, since rhythm sections provide the underpinning for a good performance by the lead instruments and vocalists, good rhythm sections are valued in the music industry. Some of the most accomplished rhythm sections have become famous, such as The Band, the E Street Band and Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare (the latter in reggae). In some popular bands, all of the band members, including rhythm section members, have become famous as individuals (e.g., the rhythm section members of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, etc.).

In almost all genres of popular music and traditional music that use rhythm sections, ranging from rock to country to jazz, the rhythm section members are expected to be able to improvise (make up) their parts or prepare their own parts for a given song by listening to the CD at home. Once the bassist and chord-playing instruments are provided with the chord progression on a lead sheet (in which chords are typically named using the root note of the chord and its quality; e.g., C Major, d minor, G7, etc.), they are expected to be able to improvise or prepare a bass line and chord voicings, respectively, that suit the style of the song.

In each style of music, there are different musical approaches and styles that rhythm section members are expected to use. For example, in a country music song the guitarist will be expected to be able to perform a chord progression using an intricate fingerpicking style; in a heavy metal song, the guitarist will be expected to play power chords and complex, precise rhythmic patterns; in a jazz song, a guitarist will be expected to be able to play &quot;jazz voicings&quot; of the chords, which emphasize the third, seventh and often the sixth or ninth chord tones (this contrasts with the barre chord voicings used in pop and rock, which emphasize the root, fifth, and to a lesser degree, the third of the chord). Drummers and percussionists are expected to be able to improvise or prepare rhythm parts that suit the style of a given song. In some cases, an arranger, orchestrator or composer will provide a written-out bass part or drum part written in music notation (the five-line staff in which the notes are round symbols with or without stems). It is rare in jazz or rock for chords to be written out in music notation; the arranger or songwriter typically writes the chord symbol and expects the guitarist to improvise the appropriate chord voicing.

=== Other roles ===

Rhythm section members may be expected to sing backup vocals or harmony parts in some styles of music. In some styles of music, notably 2010s-era pop, hip hop music and funk, rhythm section members may be required to perform a rhythmic dance routine, which may range from a simple body movement to a complex dance choreography that requires significant dance skills. In some types of heavy metal music, rhythm section members (guitar, bass, drums) may be expected to be able to &quot;headbang&quot; (move their head in an up and down fashion in time with the beat) while performing. Less commonly, some rhythm section members may sing lead vocals (e.g., Phil Collins or Sting). In some groups, one rhythm section member may have other roles, such as bandleader (e.g., jazz bassist Charles Mingus), conductor (often the case in 2010s-era musical theatre shows), songwriter, composer or arranger.

== Components ==

=== Jazz ===

In the case of swing bands, the classic rhythm section comprises a quartet of electric guitar, piano, double bass, and drums; a noted example is that of the Count Basie Orchestra with Freddie Green, the Count, Walter Page, and Jo Jones. Earlier jazz bands had used banjo in place of guitar, and other bass instruments such as the tuba for recording purposes prior to the advent of microphone technology in studios.

As bebop evolved, smaller jazz groups dropped the guitar, and many free jazz ensembles dropped the piano as well. Auxiliary percussion such as claves, bongos or maracas can also be used, especially in music influenced by strains from Latin America such as salsa and samba. In theory any instrument or instruments can provide a steady rhythm: for example, in the trio led by Jimmy Giuffre the late 1950s, the clarinet, valve trombone and guitar all switched between lead and supporting roles.

In the 1950s, some jazz bandleaders began to replace the double bass with the then-newly invented electric bass. However, the electric bass made a big impact on jazz in the 1970s, with the advent of jazz rock and jazz fusion. The electric bass was much easier to amplify to stadium-filling volumes using large bass speaker cabinets and amplifiers than an upright bass. The electric bass also began to be used as an expressive solo instrument, as exemplified by the performances of Jaco Pastorius and Stanley Clarke.

In the 1970s, the main chordal rhythm instruments were often electric instruments such as the Rhodes electric piano or electric clavinet, often run through effects units such as fuzz, phasers, or wah-wah pedals and amplified through loud keyboard amplifiers. The jazz fusion rhythm section followed the lead of the rock rhythm sections of the era, and used banks of speakers and powerful amplifiers to create a massive sound large enough for stadium concerts. In the later 1980s and subsequent decades, jazz fusion bands such as the Chick Corea Elektric Band used synthesizers in the rhythm section, both for chordal accompaniment and for synth bass parts.

=== R&amp;B, rock and pop ===

R&amp;B and rock and roll groups in the 1950s emphasized rhythm, so their backup bands generally consisted only of the standard swing band rhythm section of guitar, piano, bass, and drums supporting a vocalist, and in some cases omitting the keyboards. The bass guitar took over from the double bass in the 1950s, and had almost completely taken over the bass role in the 1960s. As the 1960s progressed the term &quot;rhythm section&quot; as used in a pop music context sometimes came to refer to just the bass and drums. For example, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr of the Beatles were referred to as the band&#x27;s rhythm section.

In the 1970s, chordal instruments such as the electric and/or acoustic guitar and various keyboards (piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, clavinet) continued to be used to augment the bass and drums in soul, funk, and reggae groups. The sound of late 1960s and 1970s rhythm sections was often given a unique tone and sound due to the use of effects units. Funk bass players would play through auto-wah or envelope follower pedals. Reggae guitarists would plug into echo pedals. Rock guitarists would run their electric guitars through distortion and wah pedals. Electric piano or clavinet players also used effects.

In the 1980s, many rock and pop bands continued to be based around the basic rock rhythm section established by 1960s and 1970s bands: electric bass, drums, and electric guitar or keyboards. In the 1980s, the first widely-affordable digital synthesizer, Yamaha&#x27;s DX7, was released. The distinctive FM synthesis tone of the DX7 is a key part of the sound of many 1980s pop and dance singles.

As electronic effects became more sophisticated, with the development of digital signal processing, during the 1980s, there was some crossover between the roles played by electronic keyboards and electric guitar. Even though electronic keyboards or organs were the standard instruments used to create sustained &quot;pads&quot; of sound (e.g., held backing chords) for ballads, with the introduction of digital delay pedals and other modern effects, electric guitars could produce similar &quot;pads&quot; or &quot;walls of sound&quot;. The Edge, the guitarist from the rock band U2, often used digital delay and reverb-drenched electric guitar arpeggios (chords played one note after the other) to create a shimmering, sustained &quot;pad&quot; for the group. These arpeggio pads created a sustained sound that was similar to the sound of an electronic keyboard. By the late 1980s, the price of digital effects pedals dropped, making these effects units available to the general public.

During the 1980s era, rhythm sections in some styles of pop took an increasing turn towards electronic instruments. A 1980s-era dance pop band might be backed up by a rhythm section of a synth bass, electronic drums (or drum machine) and various synthesizer keyboards. In some 1980s and 1990s bands, live human rhythm sections were sometimes replaced by sequenced MIDI synthesizer rhythm tracks made in the studio. In the 1980s and 1990s, the roots rock scene went in the opposite direction from dance pop; roots rock favoured traditional instruments in the rhythm section such as acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, mandolin, pedal steel guitar, acoustic bass guitar and upright bass. Another 1980s-era trend that helped revive interest in acoustic instruments was the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; style of performances, in which a rock band performs with acoustic instruments, including acoustic guitars and an acoustic bass guitar.

In rock and pop, rhythm sections range in size from the barest, stripped-down size of the &quot;power trio&quot; (guitarist, bassist, and drummer) and the organ trio (Hammond organist, drummer, and a third instrument) to large rhythm sections with several stringed instrument players (mandolin, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, etc.), multiple keyboard players (e.g., piano, Hammond organ, electric piano, synth), two instruments playing a bass role (e.g., bass guitar and synth bass) and a group of auxiliary percussionists (congas, shakers, etc.) to fill out (or &quot;sweeten&quot;) the sound. Some rhythm sections combine electronic/digital instruments that are sequenced, pre-recorded backup tracks and live instruments (including electric, electronic and acoustic instruments).

== Musical roles ==

The drums and bass both supply a rhythmic pulse for the music, and the bass instrument supplies a harmonic foundation with a bassline. The types of basslines performed by the bass guitarist vary widely from one style of music to another. Despite all of the differences in the styles of bassline in most styles of popular music, the bass guitarist fulfills a similar role: anchoring the harmonic framework (often by emphasizing the roots of the chord progression) and laying down the beat (in collaboration with the drummer). The importance of the bass guitarist and the bass line varies in different styles of music. In some pop styles, such as 1980s-era pop and musical theater, the bass sometimes plays a relatively simple part, and the music forefronts the vocals and melody instruments. In contrast, in reggae or funk, entire songs may be centered around the bass groove, and the bassline is very prominent in the mix.

Similarly, the role of the drummer varies a great deal from one style of music to another. In some types of music, such as traditional 1950s-style country music, the drummer has a rudimentary &quot;timekeeping&quot; role, and the drums are placed low in the mix by the sound engineers. In styles such as progressive rock, metal, and jazz fusion, the drummers often perform complex, challenging parts, and the drums may be given a prominent placement in the mix; as well, the drummer may be often given prominent solo breaks, fills, or introductions that put the spotlight on their technical skills and musicality. In the more experimental forms of free jazz and jazz fusion, the drummer may not play the strict &quot;timekeeping&quot; role that is associated with drums in pop music. Instead, the drums may be used more to create textured polyrhythmic soundscapes. In this type of situation, the main pulse is often provided by the bass player rather than the drummer.

The rhythm section members sometimes break out of their accompaniment role when they are asked to perform keyboard solos, bass breaks, or drum solos. In genres such as progressive rock, art rock, or progressive metal, the rhythm section members may play complicated parts along with the lead guitar (or vocalist) and perform extended solos. In jazz groups and jazz fusion bands, the rhythm section members are often called on to perform improvised solos. In jazz, the drummer may &quot;trade&quot; short solo sections with a saxophone player or trumpet player; this practice, nicknamed &quot;trading fours&quot;, typically involves the drummer and the horn player alternating four bar solo sections during a jazz tune. They can also trade eights, twos, ones, or other numbers depending on the musical context.

== Variants ==

=== Organ trios ===

In organ trios, the lower octaves of a Hammond organ or electronic keyboard are used as a substitute for bass guitar or double bass. The organist can play the bassline using the bass pedal keyboard or using the lower manual. As well, the organist could play right-hand chords and melodies. Organ trios were a widely used type of jazz ensemble in the 1950s and 1960s to play hard bop.

Organ trios are sometimes used in rock as well. The Doors&#x27; keyboardist Ray Manzarek used a keyboard bass to play the bass lines. Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore would act as an organ trio with the addition of singer Jim Morrison.

=== Dixieland bands ===

New Orleans or Dixieland jazz bands occasionally use tuba, sousaphone, or bass saxophone in place of the double bass that was common in 1920s-era jazz bands. This tradition developed from the origins of New Orleans music in marching bands, which used instruments that could be carried on harnesses or with straps. Marching bands use a mixture of brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments, because all of these instruments can be played while marching.

== Other variants ==

Not all rhythm sections follow the standard model of drummer-bassist-chordal instrument. Some bands have no drummer. In bands without a drummer, one or more instruments from the rhythm section often play in styles that replace the drum kit role—that is laying down the beat and backbeat. Traditional bluegrass bands typically do not have a drummer. In bluegrass bands, the timekeeping role is shared between several instruments: the upright bass generally plays the on-beats while the mandolin plays chop chords on the off-beats, with the banjo also keeping a steady eighth note rhythm.

This distributed nature allows for rhythmic continuity while players take turns highlighting the melody. In funk-oriented groups that do not have a drummer, the electric bass player may take over some of the drummer&#x27;s role by using slap bass. With slap bass, the bassist slaps the low strings to create a strong &quot;thump&quot; (similar to the bass drum&#x27;s role) and &quot;snaps&quot; or &quot;pops&quot; the high strings to create a percussive effect (the latter takes over some of the role played by the hi-hat cymbals). In some bands, there may be no bass player—the basslines may be played by the piano player, synth player, or guitarist. Using a guitar player to provide basslines is particularly effective if a guitar player has a seven-string guitar with a low &quot;B&quot; string.

Some jazz duos consist of a singer accompanied by a single piano player. In these duos, the jazz piano player has a challenging task; they have to provide all of the rhythmic and harmonic foundation that would normally be provided by a full rhythm section. A jazz pianist accompanying a singer in a duo needs to play a deep bassline, chords, and fill-in melody lines while the singer is performing. The pianist often improvises an instrumental solo in between vocal melodies.

Rarely, a jazz vocalist may perform in a duo with a double bass player. In this duo setting, the bass player may have to use less commonly-used bass techniques to fill out the sound, such as occasionally playing two or three-note double stops (to recreate the chord-playing role normally filled by a guitar or piano) or using percussive slaps on the fingerboard (to recreate some of the percussive elements provided by a drummer). The Canadian bassist Michel Donato has performed in a duo with singer Karen Young, and the pair released several albums in the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>Landover station is an island-platformed Washington Metro station in Landover, Maryland, United States. The station was opened on November 20, 1978, and is operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Providing service for only the Orange Line, the station is in a residential area of Landover at Pennsy Drive near Landover Road. It is primarily a commuter station, with parking for over 1,800 cars, but it also served the now-demolished Capital Centre, the former home of the Washington Bullets and Washington Capitals.

==History==
The station opened on November 20, 1978. Its opening coincided with the completion of of rail northeast of the Stadium–Armory station and the opening of the Cheverly, Deanwood, Minnesota Avenue, and New Carrollton stations.

The Pennsylvania Railroad (later Penn Central, then Conrail) previously operated a commuter rail stop at Landover, located at Old Landover Road. In August 1982, when Conrail trains began stopping at Capital Beltway station, used by intercity trains since 1970, Lanham and Landover stations were closed.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. New Carrollton station was closed from May 28, 2022, through September 5, 2022, as part of the summer platform improvement project, which also affected the Minnesota Avenue, Deanwood, Cheverly, and Landover stations on the Orange Line. Shuttle buses and free parking were provided at the closed stations.

On September 10, 2022, Blue Line trains started serving the station due to the 14th Street bridge shutdown as a part of the Blue Plus service. The service ended on May 7, 2023 with the reopening of the Yellow Line.

==Station Layout==
The Landover station consists of an at-grade island platform south of the Northeast Corridor, paralleling its right-of-way on a slight embankment above the entrance. Eastbound trains use track D1, while track D2 carries westbound trains. The mezzanine, including fare gates and ticket machines, is located below the platform on ground level. Outside of the single entrance on the southeast side of the station is a bus loop and two surface parking lots.

<doc id="664236" wikidata="Q913775" url="?curid=664236" title="Bridgeport Islanders">
<text>The Bridgeport Islanders are a professional ice hockey team playing in the American Hockey League (AHL). They are the AHL affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s New York Islanders, who own the franchise. The team started in 2001–02 season and was purchased by the Islanders in 2004. The team is based in Bridgeport, Connecticut and plays their home games at the Total Mortgage Arena.

==History==
The Bridgeport Sound Tigers joined the American Hockey League as an expansion franchise in 2001 and were coached by Steve Stirling. The team&#x27;s name referenced both the Long Island Sound where Bridgeport lies and the circuses of former resident P. T. Barnum, with the Sound Tigers identity being unveiled at the Barnum Museum. In their inaugural season, the team won their division and had the best regular season record to win the Macgregor Kilpatrick Trophy. In the playoffs, they won the Eastern Conference championship and the Richard F. Canning Trophy to advance to the Calder Cup finals against the Chicago Wolves. They lost the series four games-to-one.

In their second season, the team finished second in their division and the fifth conference seed in the playoffs. They advanced to the conference semifinals, where they lost to their division champion Binghamton Senators in six games. Stirling was promoted to head coaching position with the New York Islanders and was replaced by Greg Cronin for 2003–04. As the Sound Tigers, the team had limited success, missing the playoffs ten times and not winning a playoff round since their second season.

On May 10, 2021, it was announced that the team would change its name to the Bridgeport Islanders beginning with the 2021–22 season.

==Team identity==
===Mascot===
The lone mascot of the Bridgeport Islanders is a anthropomorphic blue tiger named Storm. He appears at home games sporting a jersey with the number 01 (short for the year the team was founded). While Storm can usually be found exciting fans throughout the arena, he skates on the ice during periodic intermissions. Storm&#x27;s appearance has changed since the team&#x27;s inaugural season. Storm has weathered the storm since the club&#x27;s change to the Islander&#x27;s moniker and is a regular at-home game. 

===Rivalries===
The main (and instate) rival of the Islanders are the Hartford Wolf Pack, the AHL affiliate of the New York Rangers (the main rival of the Bridgeport Islanders&#x27; parent club, the New York Islanders). The games have become known as the Battle of Connecticut. They have formed a rivalry with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; AHL affiliate, and the Providence Bruins, the Boston Bruins&#x27; AHL affiliate, largely due to the teams frequently facing off in playoff match-ups and regular season play. They also are semi-rivals with the Hershey Bears, the Washington Capitals&#x27; AHL affiliate.

<text>New Carrollton station is a joint Washington Metro, MARC, and Amtrak station just outside the city limits of New Carrollton, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland located at the eastern end of the Metro&#x27;s Orange Line. The station will also serve as the eastern terminus of the Purple Line, currently under construction, and is adjacent to the Capital Beltway.

Beneath the Metro station platform, a waiting room serves Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, &quot;Vermonter&quot;, and &quot;Palmetto&quot; trains, as well as MARC&#x27;s Penn Line trains. The New Carrollton Rail Yard is nearby.

Greyhound, a nationwide intercity bus company, also stops at the station on routes serving Richmond, Washington, Philadelphia, New York City, Pittsburgh, and points beyond.

==History==
The New Carrollton station is the third station in the area to serve rail traffic.

The first station, Lanham, north of the current station, opened in the 1870s. By the late 1960s, it consisted of a small shelter and an asphalt platform served by a few Penn Central (later Conrail) commuter trains between Washington and Baltimore.
The second, Capital Beltway station, sat just inside the Capital Beltway. Opened on March 16, 1970, it was served by Penn Central (later Amtrak) &quot;Metroliners&quot;.

On November 20, 1978, the Washington Metro opened its New Carrollton station, along with the Cheverly, Deanwood, Landover, and Minnesota Avenue stations, marking the completion of of Metro track northeast from the Stadium–Armory station.

In August 1982, Conrail commuter trains (later AMDOT, then the MARC Penn Line) began stopping at Capital Beltway, replacing stops at Lanham and Landover. On October 30, 1983, Amtrak and AMDOT moved from Capital Beltway to a new island platform and waiting room at New Carrollton station.

Until 2003, some &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains stopped at New Carrollton. In October 2015, the &quot;Palmetto&quot; began stopping in New Carrollton.

In May 2018, Metro announced an extensive renovation of platforms at twenty stations across the system. The Metro station was closed from May 28, 2022 to September 5, 2022, as part of the summer Platform Improvement Project, which also affected stations north of on the Orange Line. Shuttle buses and free parking were provided at the closed stations.

On September 10, 2022, Blue Line trains started serving the station due to the 14th Street bridge shutdown as a part of the Blue Plus service. The service ended on May 7, 2023 with the reopening of the Yellow Line.

The Purple Line light rail system will begin at New Carrollton and run west to Bethesda. The line will connect to Washington Metro stations on the Red and Green lines. The system is under construction as of 2022 and is scheduled to open in 2027.

==Station layout==

At New Carrollton, the Northeast Corridor consists of three tracks. The westernmost two tracks (Tracks 2 and 3) have an island platform between them, with Track 1 having no platform. To the east of the Amtrak platform is the Metro platform, serving the Orange Line. Bus loops and parking lots are located on both sides of the rail line.

The station has entrances at Harkins Road and Ellin Road, and Garden City Drive near U.S. Route 50, and Exit 19 on Interstate 495.

Long-term plans for the New Carrollton station include adding a second island platform (providing access to Track 1) and adding a fourth track.
