<text>Susan Elizabeth Rotolo (November 20, 1943 – February 25, 2011), known as Suze Rotolo ( ), was an American artist, widely known as Bob Dylan&#x27;s girlfriend from 1961 to 1964. Dylan later acknowledged her strong influence on his music and art during that period. Rotolo is the woman walking with him on the cover of his 1963 album &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, a photograph by the Columbia Records studio photographer Don Hunstein. In her book &quot;A Freewheelin&#x27; Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties&quot;, Rotolo described her time with Dylan and other figures in the folk music and bohemian scene in Greenwich Village, New York. She discussed her upbringing as a &quot;red diaper&quot; baby; a child of Communist Party USA members during the McCarthy Era. As an artist, she specialized in artists&#x27; books and taught at the Parsons School of Design in New York City.

==Biography==

===The &quot;Freewheelin&quot;&#x27; years, 1961–1964===
Rotolo, of Italian-American descent, was born at Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, New York, and raised in Sunnyside, Queens. Her parents were Joachim and Mary (née Pezzati) Rotolo, who were members of the American Communist Party. In June 1960, she graduated from Bryant High School.

At about the time she met Dylan, Rotolo began working full-time as a political activist in the office of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and the anti-nuclear group SANE. She and her sister Carla had also entered the Greenwich Village folk scene. Rotolo first met Dylan at a Riverside Church folk concert in July 1961. They were introduced by Carla, who at that time was working as an assistant to folklorist Alan Lomax. Describing their meeting in his memoir, &quot;Chronicles, Volume One&quot;, Dylan wrote:
It was not until they met that Dylan&#x27;s writing began to address issues such as the civil rights movement and the threat of nuclear war. They started living together in early 1962, much to the disapproval of her family. As Dylan&#x27;s fame grew, Rotolo found the relationship increasingly stressful. She wrote:
Rotolo left New York in June 1962, with her mother, to spend six months studying art at the University of Perugia in Italy. She was known there as Justine Rotolo, having used an invented middle name to register as &quot;S. Justine Rotolo&quot;. Dylan&#x27;s separation from his girlfriend has been credited as the inspiration behind several of his finest love songs, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s Alright&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Is a Long Time&quot;, &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot;, and &quot;Boots of Spanish Leather&quot;.

Rotolo&#x27;s political views were widely regarded as having influenced Dylan&#x27;s topical songwriting. Dylan also credited her with interesting him in the French poet Arthur Rimbaud, who heavily influenced his writing style. The influence of Bertolt Brecht on Dylan&#x27;s songwriting has also been acknowledged by Dylan as stemming from Rotolo&#x27;s participation in Brechtian theater during their relationship. In &quot;Chronicles&quot;, Dylan describes the impact of the song &quot;Pirate Jenny&quot; while attending a Brecht show on which Rotolo worked. Dylan&#x27;s interest in painting can also be traced back to his relationship with Rotolo, who had emphasized her shared values with Dylan in an interview with author Robbie Woliver:
Rotolo became pregnant in 1963 by Dylan and had an abortion. Their relationship failed to survive the abortion, Dylan&#x27;s affair with Joan Baez, and the hostility of the Rotolo family. Suze moved into her sister&#x27;s apartment in August 1963. She and Dylan broke up in 1964, in circumstances which Dylan described in his &quot;Ballad in Plain D&quot;. Twenty years later he apologized for the song, saying: &quot;I must have been a real schmuck to write that. I look back at that particular one and say, of all the songs I&#x27;ve written, maybe I could have left that alone.&quot;

===Later life and death, 1964–2011===
Rotolo traveled to Cuba in June 1964, with a group, although it was unlawful for United States citizens to do so. She was quoted as saying, in regard to opponents of Fidel Castro that, &quot;These &quot;gusanos&quot; are not suppressed. There can be open criticism of the regime. As long as they keep it to talk they are tolerated, as long as there is no sabotage.&quot;

Rotolo married Enzo Bartoccioli, an Italian film editor who worked for the United Nations, in 1967. Together they had one son, Luca, who is a guitarist in New York. In New York, Rotolo worked as an illustrator and painter, before concentrating on creating book art, things resembling books but incorporating found objects. Remaining politically active, Rotolo joined the street-theater group Billionaires for Bush and protested at the 2004 Republican National Convention in Manhattan.

Rotolo avoided discussing her relationship with Dylan for decades. In July 2004, she was interviewed in a documentary produced by New York PBS Channel 13 and &quot;The New York Daily News&quot;. In November 2004, she made an unannounced appearance at the Experience Music Project, on a panel discussing Dylan&#x27;s early days in Greenwich Village. She and her husband also were involved in putting on a memorial event for Dave Van Ronk after the singer&#x27;s death in 2002. Rotolo made an appearance in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s documentary film, &quot;No Direction Home: Bob Dylan&quot;, which focused on Dylan&#x27;s early career from 1961 to 1966. This film was broadcast as part of the &quot;American Masters&quot; series on PBS public television in September 2005. Rotolo was also interviewed nationally in 2008 by Terry Gross on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot; to promote her book, &quot;A Freewheelin&#x27; Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties&quot;, which was published by Broadway Books on May 13, 2008. Rotolo recounted her attempts not to be overshadowed by her relationship with Dylan. She discussed her need to pursue her artistic creativity and to retain her political integrity, concluding:
The image of Rotolo walking with Dylan on the cover of &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; proved impossible to shake off, but equally difficult to accept. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing her book, observed that
&quot;The Guardian&quot;, too, notes that Rotolo is defined as &quot;the girl with the wistful eyes and hint of a smile whose head is resting on the suede-jacketed shoulder of a nice-looking young man as they trudge through the snow on the cover of 1963&#x27;s &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;.&quot; The review agrees with the &quot;New York Times&quot;″s comment (&quot;a disconnected list&quot;) that the book is &quot;oddly organised&quot;, but at once adds &quot;though not as random as it seems&quot;. Nathalie Rothschild, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; after Rotolo&#x27;s death, noted that Rotolo had worked hard to escape the epithets of &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s muse&quot; and &quot;the girl on the front cover of The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;, insisting in her memoir that she had been more than &quot;a string on Dylan&#x27;s guitar&quot;.

Rotolo died of lung cancer at her home in New York City&#x27;s NoHo neighborhood on February 25, 2011, aged 67.

==Film portrayals==
In the 2007 film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;, a fictional account of Bob Dylan&#x27;s life, there is a version of Rotolo&#x27;s relationship with Dylan. Heath Ledger plays Robbie Clark, one of six Dylan-based characters in the film. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Claire, the wife of Robbie. This character has been described as a combination of Sara Dylan, Dylan&#x27;s first wife, and Suze Rotolo. In the film, Robbie meets Claire in a Greenwich Village diner and they fall in love. The scene in which Robbie and Claire run romantically through the streets of New York re-enacts the cover of the 1963 album &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot;.

In the 2024 biographical film &quot;A Complete Unknown&quot;, Sylvie Russo, a fictional version of Rotolo, is played by Elle Fanning. Dylan requested that the film not use Rotolo&#x27;s real name. Angie Martoccio of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described the Russo character as &quot;Rotolo in all but name&quot;.

<text>Friends&#x27; Provident Insurance was a banking institution founded in 1832 to serve the needs of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Based in Bradford, Yorkshire, it concentrated on sickness and annuity policies until its life fund acquired Century Insurance in 1918, expanding into general insurance. The restriction to Quaker membership was an increasing constraint but the ties were substantially reduced by the Friends&#x27; Provident Institution Act 1915 (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. xlv). Although Century&#x27;s branch network enabled FPI to expand, the periodic underwriting losses strained the life fund&#x27;s capital base and Century was sold in 1975. In the year 2000, Friends Provident demutualised and listed on the FT100 Index. After abortive takeover negotiations, Friends accepted a takeover bid from Resolution Limited in 2009.

==History==

=== The early years===

Samuel Tuke and Joseph Rowntree first mooted the ideal of a friendly society in 1829, to serve the needs of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Tuke, who was a prominent leader in the Society and a city councillor in York, took the lead and was the insurer&#x27;s first chairman. No capital was initially subscribed; &quot;solvency was guaranteed by a bond entered into by several trustees&quot; chiefly of noted Quaker families. Funds were subsequently raised from 45 prominent Quakers and, with a board of 20 directors, Friends&#x27; Provident Insurance [FPI] was launched in 1832. There was only one member of staff, Benjamin Ecroyd the Secretary, a conveyancer in Bradford, and the FPI opened in a room above a confectioner&#x27;s shop in Market Street Bradford. The office remained until 1862 when the FPI bought the old county court building at Darley Street.

The first classes of business were annuities for members aged over 55 and children&#x27;s deferred policies. After its initial ten years, when life funds had reached £150,000, FPI was able to declare its first bonuses on life policies. Agencies were gradually appointed, all through the offices of the Society of Friends and by 1862 there were 42 in England, one each in Wales and Scotland, and eight in Ireland. Life funds increased progressively to £1m. in 1870, £2m. in 1889, and £3m. in 1902. As FPI grew in size it, increasingly found itself constrained by the Friendly Society Acts and especially its confinement to members of the Society of Friends. By the 1890s this was regarded as serious impediment to growth The restriction on investment powers was resolved by the (62 &amp; 63 Vict. c. lv) but the Quaker constraints took longer to resolve. There was little scope to increase agents as these were tied to Quaker meetings and had been fully exploited; there were no branches except London. Poor results in 1908 and 1909 led to a search for solutions and there were abortive negotiations for Royal Exchange Assurance to take over FPI in 1912. In 1914, FPI agreed to accept non-Quakers for non-profit policies only but the major change came with the (5 &amp; 6 Geo. 5. c. xlv). This incorporated FPI as a mutual life assurance office free from the remaining restrictions of the Friendly Society Acts and accepting all the provisions of the Companies Act. It was no longer necessary to appoint trustees to hold property or exercise other legal functions. Under new rules membership still primarily required membership of, or association with. the Society of Friends; however, the directors were given power to admit any appropriate person. The directors now recognised that new leadership was required if FPI was to expand and in 1916 Henry Tapscott, the branch manager of Royal Exchange at Birmingham was appointed the first general manager; as a sign of the changes underway, he was not a Quaker.

===The Century acquisition===

A central part of Tapscott&#x27;s strategy was to move FPI into general insurance but there were no powers to do so under the Friends&#x27; Provident Institution Act 1915. However, there was nothing to prevent it investing in a company and in 1918 FPI&#x27;s life fund bought the Century Insurance Company of Edinburgh at a cost of £507,000, 15 per cent of the life fund&#x27;s assets. Century was founded in 1885, as Sickness and Accident Assurance but as the general insurance business expanded it changed its name to Century Insurance Co. in 1901. Unlike FPI, Century had well-established branches with five in Scotland, 13 in England, one in Wales and two in Ireland and these were intended to be the vehicle for FPI&#x27;s expansion. Century had also developed significant overseas interests. By 1914, agencies had been opened in eight European countries, two in Australia and three in India. A shred underwriting agreement had also been made with Henry W Brown, which operated in most states of the United States.

Following the Century acquisition, the FPI head office was moved from Bradford to Kingsway, London; the head office of Century remained in Edinburgh but its general insurance business was moved to London. The Century agents were used to expand FPI&#x27;s life business. In recognition of the changes, in 1920 the name of the company was changed to Friends&#x27; Provident and Century Life Office although legally Century remained owned by the FPI life fund. Apart from losses in marine insurance, the combined business made good progress. Through Century, the Pacific Coast Fire Company of Canada was also bought in 1920 and there was a further significant increase in the fire business when in 1926 it bought Liverpool Marine &amp; General Insurance. The growth in business required larger premises and in 1928 a new office at 7 Leadenhall Street was bought. However, the expansion of Century&#x27;s business, particularly in North America was causing strains that would eventually lead to its disposal.

By the late 1920s, the growth in Century&#x27;s business was requiring an equivalent increase in capital and this put a strain on the resources of the FPI life fund. A new holding company, Century Insurance Trust, was formed to hold all the general insurance companies and this was able to raise its own loan capital. Worse was to come in the form of the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression. The Group was more heavily invested in U.S. and Canadian stocks than most life companies and those investments fell by more than 50 per cent. More than 60 per cent of Century&#x27;s general insurance business was written in the U.S. and Canada; its premium income fell by 25 per cent over the two years 1929 and 1930 and underwriting results were also poor. By the end of 1930, FPI &#x27;s life fund assets were valued at five per cent less than its liabilities. FPI even cancelled its planned centenary bonus. Substantial cost reductions and better fund revaluations allowed the life business to grow. Friends Provident began writing pensions business in 1934 and this became large enough to form a group life and pensions department in 1937. By the end of the 1930s, life premium income was double that of 1929.

===The End of Century===

Post-war growth was encouraging, prompting a further move of head office. In 1954, Friends&#x27; Provident bought 43 acres outside Dorking in 1954 and a new headquarters was opened in 1958. However, the position in North America began to worsen. US and Canada made losses in fire and motor between 1951 and 1957 and Century made heavy trading losses in 1957, once again impacting on the value of the life fund. In 1963 Century withdrew entirely from the US fire and accident market and consolidated its position in Canada. Century suffered fire losses in 1973and 1974 and recognised that in accident and marine it was hard to match the expense ratios of the larger companies. At the same time, the need for increased solvency and regulatory changes had reduced the life fund&#x27;s value of Century to less than half its written down value. It was agreed that on 1 January 1975, Phoenix Insurance would buy all of Century Insurance worldwide for shares in the enlarged group. The official announcement stated that &quot;This agreement is in the best interest of both companies with the advantages of a greater volume, well distributed&quot;

===A Life Office once again===

The company; now known as Friends&#x27; Provident Life, was once again a life-only mutual company. Despite the problems of Century, it been expanding. In 1957 it had entered the life market in Canada by buying 90 per cent of Fidelity Life Assurance of Regina, Saskatchewan and in 1960 it opened a life branch in Australia. By the 1970s it had been agreed that the life business and the general business of Century should not be operated out of the same office and a separate branch structure was established for the life office. The sale of Century was followed by (c. xiv) to update the rules, ending the requirement that a majority of the directors had to be Quakers. The new rules allowed for at least five out of a Board of ten to twenty directors to be Quakers. That year also saw Phoenix sell its Australian life business to Friends&#x27; Provident. By 1981, a league table of British life offices listed Friends&#x27; Provident as fifteenth by assets.

In 1986 Friends merged with UK Provident. In 1992 it became a foundation partner in the Eureko Alliance in association with AVCB (The Netherlands), Topdanmark (Denmark) and Wasa (Sweden). As part of this alliance, Friends Provident passed all of its then non UK subsidiaries (primarily in Australia, Canada and Ireland) into Eureko. The Irish entity continued on the Friend&#x27;s Provident brand for a number of years until ultimately renaming as Friends&#x27; First in 1998.

In 1993 it acquired the UK operations of National Mutual of Australia and in 1998 it acquired London &amp; Manchester Assurance.

In November 1997, Friends Provident announced that it would merge its asset management business with Ivory and Sime, in a deal worth £132 million, thereby creating Friends Ivory &amp; Sime. Following the transaction, Friends Provident owned 67% of the combined entity.

===Demutualisation and the Resolution acquisition===

In the year 2000, Friends Provident demutualised and listed on the FT100 Index, raising £1.6m. Its two main businesses were life and pensions, and asset management through its 67% holding in Friends Ivory and Sime. As part of the demutualisation the Friends Provident Foundation was endowed as an independent charity. The asset management was enlarged by the purchase of Royal Sun &amp; Alliance&#x27;s asset business and then again in 2004 by the merger with F&amp;C Asset Management. This left Friends Provident with 51% of the enlarged F &amp; C, managing £125 billion funds. In July 2007, Friends announced an agreed &quot;merger of equals&quot; with insurer Resolution plc but this collapsed in November as a result of shareholder opposition. This prompted a strategic review, including cost cutting and a proposed demerger of F &amp; C. In January 2008 Friends received an informal £4.1 billion offer by JC Flowers, later aborted. In 2009 a newly formed Resolution Limited returned with a fresh approach and in August a bid of £1.86 billion was accepted. In the November, Friends Provident duly became a subsidiary of Resolution.

==Operations==
The UK Life and Pensions business marketed a range of life protection, income protection, pensions and investment products for individual customers and corporate clients throughout the UK.

The International Life and Pensions business operated throughout Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

==Ethical stance==

<doc id="661078" wikidata="Q3457190" url="?curid=661078" title="Six Nations of the Grand River">
<text>Six Nations (or Six Nations of the Grand River) is demographically the largest First Nations reserve in Canada. As of the end of 2017, it has a total of 27,276 members, 12,848 of whom live on the reserve. The six nations of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca and Tuscarora. Some Lenape (also known as Delaware) live in the territory as well.

The Six Nations reserve is bordered by the County of Brant, Norfolk County, and Haldimand County, with a subsection reservation, the New Credit Reserve, located within its boundaries. The acreage at present covers some near the city of Brantford, Ontario. This represents approximately 8% of the original of land granted to the Six Nations by the 1784 Haldimand Proclamation.

==History==
Many of the Haudenosaunee people allied with the British during the American Revolutionary War, particularly warriors from the Mohawk, Cayuga, Onondaga and Seneca nations. Some warriors of the Oneida and Tuscarora also allied with them, as warfare was highly decentralized. These nations had longstanding trade relations with the British and hoped they might stop European-American encroachment on their territories. These allies were from the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy.

After the American victory in the conflict, the Crown ceded all of its territory in the colonies to their new government under a peace treaty, including that belonging to the Six Nations without consulting them or making them party to treaty negotiations. The Crown worked to resettle native Loyalists in Canada and provide some compensation for lands lost in the new United States. The Crown also hoped to use these new settlers, both Native Americans and European Americans, to develop agriculture and towns in areas west of Quebec, the territory later known as Upper Canada.

The new lands granted to Six Nations reserves were all near important Canadian military targets and placed along the border to prevent any American invasion. The growth of the Six Nations community was also hampered. Land, especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, granted a certain measure of power to their owners. Influential leaders such as Joseph Brant and Deseronto were prevented from granting land to business owners who could have brought industry and agriculture to their lands.

After the war, Mohawk leaders John Deseronto and Joseph Brant met with British commander Sir Frederick Haldimand to discuss the loss of their lands in New York. Haldimand promised to resettle the Mohawk near the Bay of Quinte, on the northeast shore of Lake Ontario, in present-day Ontario, Canada. Haldimand purchased from other First Nations a tract by on the Bay of Quinte, which he granted to the Mohawk. (There are of course questions about First Nations understanding of such purchase). About 200 Mohawk settled with Deseronto at what is now called the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario. The group of Mohawk originally led by John Deseronto, who died in the town named after him, settled on the Bay of Quinte known as &quot;Tyendinaga&quot;. These were primarily Mohawk of the Lower Castle (of New York).

===Six Nations at Grand River===
Brant decided that he preferred to settle on the Grand River north of Lake Erie. Mohawk of the Upper Castle joined him in settling on the Grand River, as did bands of the other Six Nations. By the Haldimand Proclamation of October 25, 1784, the government granted a tract of land to the Mohawk Nation and Six Nations bands in appreciation of their support for the Crown during the revolution. The Crown had purchased the lands previously from the Mississauga on May 22, 1784, as part of the Between the Lakes Treaty. Joseph Brant led a large group of Iroquois to settle in what is now referred to as &quot;Six Nations of the Grand River.&quot;

A 1785 census recorded 1,843 Natives living on the Grand River reserve, including 548 Mohawk, 281 Cayuga, 145 Onondaga, 262 Oneida, 109 Tuscarora, and 98 Seneca. There were also 400 persons from other tribes, including Lenape, and others from southern territory, such as the Nanticoke, Tutelo, and some Creek and Cherokee. African-American slaves were also brought to Six Nations and Brantford by Joseph Brant. Brant encouraged members of his family to marry local Blacks, absorbing them into the population on the reserve. From the 1830s to the 1860s many runaway slaves, escaping through the Underground Railroad, were received and absorbed into the population of Six Nations. Along with the African-Americans who settled largely in the area around Cainsville, Joseph Brant invited several Anglo-American white families to live on the grant, particularly veterans of Brant&#x27;s Volunteers and Butler&#x27;s Rangers from New York, who had fought with him during the war. To encourage his loyalist friends to settle there, Brant gave them larger grants than the government had given other loyalists in other areas of Upper Canada. Some Canadians objected to Brant giving such land grants to whites in the reserve area.

As the government did for European Americans, the Indian department provided the Haudenosaunee with some tools and other provisions for resettlement, including such items as saws, axes, grindstones, and chisels. They received help in establishing schools and churches, and in acquiring farm equipment and other necessities. Conditions were extremely difficult in the first years on the frontier, as the government did not provide enough supplies or assistance to any of the resettled loyalists, neither Native Americans nor European Americans. They had to create new settlements out of woodlands. In 1785, the government built the first Protestant church in Upper Canada (now Ontario) on the reserve; it was known as Her Majesty&#x27;s Royal Chapel of the Mohawks. The Crown maintained its support of this chapel, and it is among only twelve Chapels Royal in the world.

The main town developed at what is now Brantford. It was first called Brant&#x27;s Town after Joseph Brant, who built his residence there. In 1798, it was described as a large and sprawling settlement. Brant&#x27;s home was a two-story house, built in a European-American style. In 1797, Brant founded one of the earliest Masonic Lodges in Upper Canada; he achieved the rank of its Worshipful Master.

Governor John Simcoe confirmed the Grant with a limited deed on January 14, 1793. Also, this deed forbade them to sell the land to anyone but each other and the king. Led by Joseph Brant, the chiefs rejected the deed. In 1795, the Grand River chiefs empowered Joseph Brant to sell large blocks of land in the northern section, which the Haudenosaunee were not using at the time. They set terms of no money down because they wanted to take their payment entirely in future years as annual interest. At this time, the population on the reserve was declining; some Haudenosaunee left the Grand River for traditional native communities in New York. After Brant&#x27;s land sales started in 1795, the population began to increase again. He and the chiefs insisted on annuities to help the Six Nations community survive.

According to the Haldimand Proclamation, the original tract of land stretched from the mouth of the Grand River on the shores of Lake Erie to the river&#x27;s head, and for 10 km (6 mi) from either bank. However, the grant of land included land around the source that the Crown had not purchased from the Mississauga. A purchase from the Mississauga was later arranged, but not carried out. Between 1795 and 1797, Joseph Brant sold to land speculators; the property comprising the northern half of the reserve was sold for £85,332. This was the highest price paid to Haudenosaunee up to this time for undeveloped land.
Governor Simcoe opposed the land sales. The interest on the annuity promised an income to the people of £5,119 per year, far more than any other Iroquois people had received. The land speculators were unable to sell farm-size lots to settlers fast enough. By 1801, however, all the land speculators had fallen behind in their payments. Because of the lack of payments, Brant was determined to sell more land to make up for the missing payments.

In 1796, Lord Dorchester issued another deed for the land. This empowered the Haudenosaunee to lease or sell their land, provided they offered it first for sale to the government. Brant rejected this deed, partly because the deed named the Six Nations as communal owners of the land. He believed the deed should be limited to the current persons living on the land.

By 1800, two-thirds of the Haudenosaunee had not yet adapted to the style of subsistence agriculture maintained by separate households that the Canadian government encouraged. Brant had hoped that sales of land to European Americans would help them develop the frontier, but conditions were difficult for such agriculture.

In 1813, the chiefs and councillors of the Six Nations residing in the state of New York would declare war on the provinces of Upper and Lower Canada.

In 1828, chief John Brant was appointed resident for the Six Nations of the Grand River.

The Six Nations people were originally given 10 km (6 miles) on either side of the entire length of the Grand River, although much of the land was later sold. The ongoing Grand River land dispute is the result of disputes over the sale process. The current reserves encompass 184.7 km2 (71 sq mi), all but 0.4 km2 (100 acres) in Six Nations reserve No. 40.

In the late 19th century, the Scottish doctor Joseph Bell excavated skulls of indigenous people in the six nations. These skulls reached Berlin through the mediation of the doctor William Osler, where they were considered untraceable for decades. In 2020, the journalists David Bruser and Markus Grill, supported by the ethnologist Nils Seethaler, succeeded in finding the skulls in the anatomical collection of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory. A return of the skulls to the care of the community of origin was suggested in this context.

On July 24, 2024, Ice hockey player Brandon Montour became the first person to bring the Stanley Cup to Ohsweken after the Florida Panthers won their first championship following their series win over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 7 of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals. A parade was held in his honour that went from the Ohsweken Speedway to the Gaylord Powless Arena.

==Communities==
Several named communities exist within the Six Nations reserve:
*Beavers Corner
*Longboat Corners
*Medina Corners
*Millers Corner
*Ohsweken
*St. Johns
*Sixty-Nine Corners
*Smith Corners
*Smoothtown
*Sour Spring
*Stoneridge

==Members==

They later welcomed to the reserve a group of Lenape, who speak &quot;Munsee&quot;, an Algonquian language.

Six Nations of the Grand River is the most populous reserve in Canada. As of March 2023, there were 28,520 band members, of whom 11,688 lived on the reserve. The population consists of the following bands:
==Government==
The Six Nations of the Grand River Elected Council is a governing body established to run the affairs of the reserve in 1924, formed under the &quot;Indian Act&quot;. The Elected Council has, since its foundation, been the primary government of Six Nations recognised by the Government of Canada. However, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy Chiefs Council has maintained a presence on the reserve despite the establishment of the elected council, representing a continuity with the traditional government of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.

==Notable people==
==Education==
Prior to colonization, education in Haudenosaunee communities took place in &quot;unstructured and non-coercive ways.&quot; This continues to this day alongside provincial education.

Members of the Six Nations attended the Mohawk Institute, a residential school which was the subject of numerous abuse allegations. Upon closure of the institute in 1972, the residential school was replaced by the Woodland Cultural Centre.

Day schools were also operated on the reserve under the Six Nations School Board (1878–1933), the first Indigenous school board in Ontario. While the official colonial curriculum was taught and many non-Indigenous teachers taught on the reserve, Indigenous influence on the board allowed for the hiring of many Six Nations teachers, many of them women as was and continues to be the case at the elementary level in Ontario. Teachers on the reserve also formed their own association for professional development, the Six Nations Teacher&#x27;s Organization.

<text>(&quot;The Shepherd King&quot;) is an opera, K. 208, written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to an Italian libretto by Metastasio, edited by Giambattista Varesco. It is an opera seria. The opera was first performed on 23 April 1775 in Salzburg in the Rittersaal (knight&#x27;s hall) of the Residenz-Theater in the palace of the Archbishop Count Hieronymus von Colloredo.

In 1775 the opera was commissioned for a visit by the Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria, the youngest son of Empress Maria Theresa, to Salzburg. Mozart spent six weeks working on the opera. It consists of two acts and runs for approximately 107 minutes.

Metastasio wrote the libretto in 1751, basing it on a work by Torquato Tasso called &quot;Aminta&quot;. The libretto was picked up when Mozart (just 19 at the time) and his father saw a performance of it set to music composed by Felice Giardini – Mozart&#x27;s version, however was two acts rather than Giardini&#x27;s three, and has a few substantial changes. Each act lasts for around an hour in performance. The Salzburg court chaplain Varesco was largely responsible for this editing of Metastasio&#x27;s libretto.

It is often referred to not as an opera, but as a serenata, a type of dramatic cantata. The appearance of a quartet of lovers (Aminta and Elisa, Agenore and Tamiri) of somewhat dubious fidelity automatically puts a modern audience in mind of the later &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;. The principal psychological theme of the opera is, however, the demands of love against the demands of kingship, as Aminta, the shepherd-king, tussles with his conscience, and in this &quot;Il re pastore&quot; is closer in theme to &quot;Idomeneo&quot; than any other of Mozart&#x27;s operas. Indeed, &quot;Idomeneo&quot; was the next completed opera that Mozart wrote after &quot;Il re pastore&quot;, after his six-year-long break from the stage. Furthermore, the theme of qualities for kingship appears in another opera, &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, his last one.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
The king of Macedonia, Alessandro, has overthrown Stratone, the tyrant of Sidon, but aims to find the rightful king.

===Act 1===
&quot;In a meadow. The city of Sidon can be seen from a distance.&quot;

Elisa is with her lover Aminta, the shepherd. She assures him that the war between King Alessandro and Stratone, the tyrant of Sidon, will not affect their love for each other. Having deposed Stratone, Alessandro searches for the rightful heir to Sidon. He thinks that Aminta is the rightful heir. He comes to Aminta in disguise and offers him to take him to Alessandro. Aminta wants to remain a shepherd. Meantime, Agenore encounters his beloved Tamiri, daughter of Stratone. Tamiri is comforted to learn that Agenore still loves her.

Elisa gets permission from her father to marry Aminta. Aminta tells Elisa that he is the rightful heir to the throne and that his father was driven out by Stratone when he was a baby. Aminta promises to return to Elisa after claiming his throne. Aminta loves Elisa but Alessandro suggests that when Aminta is hailed king, royal duties take precedence over love. Alessandro suggests that Tamiri marry Aminta in order to ascend her father&#x27;s throne. Aminta disagrees.

===Act 2===
&quot;Macedonian Camp.&quot;

Elisa is prevented by Agenore from seeing Aminta. He also discourages Aminta from pursuing her. Alessandro tells Aminta to dress like a king so he can be presented to his subjects. He also decides that Tamiri marry Aminta. Aminta is distraught. Agenore is upset. He breaks the news to Elisa. Tamiri does not want to marry Aminta. Agenore, too, is tormented by the planned marriage. Tamiri tells Alessandro that she and Agenore are in love. The women throw themselves onto Alessandro&#x27;s mercy. Elisa begs him to give her back Aminta who declares his love for Elisa (&quot;L&#x27;amerò, sarò costante&quot; / I shall love her, I shall be constant). Realizing the potential injustice he was about to inflict, Alessandro tells Aminta to marry Elisa and Tamiri to marry Agenore. Aminta is crowned king of Sidon.

<text>The northern black flycatcher (Melaenornis edolioides) is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family, Muscicapidae.

== Range ==
This is an insectivorous species which is a resident breeder in tropical Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia and south to Zaire and Tanzania.

== Habitat ==
The northern black flycatcher is found in moist wooded areas and cultivation. It nests in a hole or reuses the old nest of another species, and lays two or three eggs. Breeding takes place in the wet season.

== Description ==
The northern black flycatcher is long. It is a large upright long-tailed flycatcher. The adult is uniformly black. Juveniles are blackish-brown with buff scaling.

The long square-ended tail helps to distinguish this species from two other all-black insectivores, the fork-tailed drongo and the shorter-tailed and red-eyed common square-tailed drongo.

== Song ==
This flycatcher has a simple musical song and a thin &quot;tsee-whee&quot; call.

<doc id="661085" wikidata="Q92952" url="?curid=661085" title="Peter Landin">
<text>Peter John Landin (5 June 1930 – 3 June 2009) was a British computer scientist. He was one of the first to realise that the lambda calculus could be used to model a programming language, an insight that is essential to the development of both functional programming and denotational semantics.

==Academic==
Landin was born in Sheffield, where he attended King Edward VII School; he graduated from Clare College, Cambridge. From 1960 to 1964, he was the assistant to Christopher Strachey when the latter was an independent computer consultant in London. Most of his work was published during this period and the brief time he worked for Univac and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, before taking a position at Queen Mary University of London. During the 1970s and 1980s, his efforts went into building the computer science department in Queen Mary College, developing courses, and teaching students, as set forth in the foreword to the textbook &quot;Programming from First Principles&quot;. On his retirement, he was appointed Emeritus Professor of Theoretical Computation at Queen Mary University of London, where in 2012, the computer science building was renamed the Peter Landin Building in his honour.

At a workshop at the Science Museum, London, in 2001, on the history of programming semantics he spoke of how his scholarly career in computer science began in the late 1950s and of how he was much influenced by a study of John McCarthy&#x27;s Lisp language when the most commonly used language was Fortran.

He was active in the definition of the ALGOL programming language. He is listed among those who attended the November 1959 conference in Paris, and the 1962 conference, and cited by Tony Hoare as one of the people who taught him ALGOL 60 and hence facilitated his expression of powerful recursive algorithms:

Landin was involved with international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

Landin is responsible for inventing the &quot;stack, environment, control, dump&quot; SECD machine, the first abstract machine for a functional programming language, and the ISWIM programming language, defining the Landin &quot;off-side rule&quot; and for coining the term &quot;syntactic sugar&quot;. The off-side rule allows bounding scope declaration by use of white spaces as seen in languages such as Miranda, Haskell, Python, and F# (using the &quot;light&quot; syntax).

Another phrase originating with Landin is &quot;The next 700 ...&quot; after his influential paper &quot;The next 700 programming languages&quot;. &quot;700&quot; was chosen because Landin had read in the &quot;Journal of the ACM&quot; that there were already 700 programming languages then extant. The paper opens with the quotation &quot;... today ... 1,700 special programming languages used to &#x27;communicate&#x27; in over 700 application areas.&quot; It also includes the joke that

a reference to his earlier paper. This dry sense of humour is expressed in many of his papers.

==Political==
Landin, who was bisexual, became involved with the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) during the early 1970s. He was once arrested as part of an anti-nuclear demonstration.
He was a dedicated cyclist and moved around London on his bike until it became physically impossible for him to do so.

==Legacy==
The Bodleian Library in Oxford holds an archive of material relating to Peter Landin. Since 2010, there has been an &quot;Annual Peter Landin Semantics Seminar&quot; held annually each December organized by the BCS-FACS Specialist Group on Formal Aspects of Computing Science. The first seminar was delivered by the American computer scientist John C. Reynolds (1935–2013). There is a Peter Landin Building at Queen Mary University of London housing teaching and research facilities for computer science.

<doc id="661087" wikidata="Q339752" url="?curid=661087" title="Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick">
<text>Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, KG (c. 1530 – 21 February 1590) was an English nobleman and general, and an elder brother of Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Their father was John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who led the English government from 1550–1553 under King Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey on the English throne after the King&#x27;s death in July 1553. For his participation in this venture, Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. Reprieved, his rehabilitation came after he fought for King Philip in the Battle of St. Quentin.

On Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s accession in November 1558, Dudley was appointed Master of the Ordnance, in which capacity he was to unofficially assist William the Silent in his struggle against Spain by delivering English weaponry. As the senior member of his family, Dudley was created Earl of Warwick in December 1561. In 1562–1563 he commanded the army Elizabeth sent to Le Havre to garrison the town and assist the Huguenots in the First French War of Religion. This campaign ended in failure when the French belligerents agreed to a peace and the English surrendered because of the plague which was decimating their ranks. Dudley, who had acted honorably throughout, returned with a severe leg wound which was to hinder his further career and ultimately led to his death 27 years later. His last military engagement was against the Northern rebels in 1569. From 1573 he served as a privy councillor.

Despite three marriages, Ambrose Dudley remained childless after the death of an infant daughter in 1552. This had serious repercussions for the survival of his dynasty, since his only surviving brother, Robert, equally died without legitimate issue. With him, Ambrose Dudley had a very close relationship, and in business and personal life they did many things together. Like Robert Dudley, Ambrose was a major patron of the Elizabethan Puritan movement and supported non-conforming preachers in their struggle with the Church authorities. Due to his homely way of life—and in contrast to the colourful Earl of Leicester—Ambrose Dudley became known to posterity as the &quot;Good Earl of Warwick&quot;.

==Youth==
Ambrose Dudley was the fourth son of Sir John Dudley, later Viscount Lisle, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland, and his wife Jane Guildford. The Dudleys had 13 children in all and were known for their Protestant leanings as well as for their happy family life. Ambrose Dudley and his brothers were trained by, among others, the mathematician John Dee and the rhetorician Thomas Wilson. In August 1549, Dudley went to Norfolk with his father and his younger brother Robert to fight against the rebel peasant army of Robert Kett. Back in London, Dudley was knighted and married Anne Whorwood, daughter of William Whorwood, deceased Attorney-General. In 1552, they had a daughter who died soon. Anne also died in 1552, of the sweating sickness. Dudley soon married for the second time: Elizabeth, Lady Tailboys (or Talboys, 1520–1563), who was a baroness in her own right with large possessions in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.

After the death of King Edward VI on 6 July 1553, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, who had led the young king&#x27;s government for the last three and a half years, tried to install his daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey on the English throne; she was the King&#x27;s Protestant cousin to whom Edward had willed the Crown, bypassing his half-sisters Mary and Elizabeth. When Mary Tudor asserted her right to the throne, an expedition against her base in East Anglia became inevitable. Northumberland marched on 14 July, accompanied by his eldest sons, John and Ambrose. Five days later the Privy Council changed sides; on hearing this on 20 July, Northumberland, who had been staying at Cambridge, gave up and was arrested with his party the next day.

Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London with his father and his four brothers. All were attainted and condemned to death, but only the Duke and Guildford Dudley, the second youngest brother, were executed. After the natural death of John, the eldest brother, in October 1554, Ambrose Dudley was the family&#x27;s heir; he remained longest in the Tower, being released late in 1554 after a plea by his wife, Lady Tailboys. On the whole, the brothers&#x27; release was brought about by their mother and their brother-in-law Henry Sidney, who successfully lobbied the Spanish nobles around Queen Mary I&#x27;s new husband and co-ruler, Philip of Spain. Out of prison, in December 1554 or January 1555, Ambrose and Robert Dudley took part in one of several tournaments held by Philip to celebrate Anglo-Spanish friendship.

Also in January 1555, Dudley&#x27;s mother died, leaving him her lands, which Queen Mary allowed him to inherit despite his attainder. However, the Dudley brothers were only welcome at court as long as King Philip was there; later in 1555 they were even ordered out of London and the next year, in the wake of a conspiracy by their second cousin Sir Henry Dudley, the French ambassador Antoine de Noailles reported that the government was seeking to apprehend &quot;the children of the Duke of Northumberland&quot;, who were said to be on the run. By January 1557, the brothers were raising personal contingents in order to fight for Philip, now also King of Spain. Ambrose, Robert, and Henry Dudley joined the Spanish forces in France and took part in the Battle of St Quentin, where Henry Dudley was killed. For these services, the two surviving brothers were restored in blood by Act of Parliament in 1558. The cost of the campaign almost bankrupted Ambrose Dudley and his wife, however, so that they had to reduce their household significantly.

==Serving Elizabeth I==
With the accession of Elizabeth I in November 1558, Robert Dudley came into great favour and was made Master of the Horse. Ambrose Dudley received the post of Master of the Ordnance, though he pressed his influential brother to delay the appointment somewhat, so that he could not be held accountable for his predecessor&#x27;s embezzlement of funds. When their attainder had been lifted in 1558, the Dudley brothers had renounced any rights to their father&#x27;s possessions or titles. Yet on 25 and 26 December 1561, Ambrose Dudley was created Baron Lisle and Earl of Warwick, and the next year received a large portion of the lands confiscated from the Duke of Northumberland. Warwick Castle—which the Queen visited on her 1572 summer progress—became his seat, while the neighbouring Kenilworth Castle became that of Robert Dudley. Like their father, Ambrose and Robert Dudley adopted the bear and ragged staff, the heraldic device of the medieval Earls of Warwick.

In 1562 the First War of Religion started in France, and Elizabeth was under pressure from her Protestant councillors to help the Huguenots. These were in possession of Le Havre, which was besieged by the Catholic Duke of Guise, and offered it to the English in return for military help—later, they promised, they would exchange it for Calais, which England had lost to France only in 1558. Elizabeth agreed to send 6,000 men to garrison Le Havre. Ambrose Dudley was chosen to lead the expedition in place of Robert Dudley, whom Elizabeth would not let go despite his strong desire to do so.

Warwick arrived at Le Havre in late October 1562. He was sceptical from the start as to the chances to hold Le Havre, writing: &quot;I fear [you] are too much abused in the good opinion you have in the strength of this town&quot;. Elizabeth soon made it clear that she did not wish his army to engage in any active support for the Huguenot side, the purpose of the English contribution remaining somewhat obscure. In March 1563, the warring French agreed to a peace, while Elizabeth decided to hold on to Le Havre until Calais was returned to the English, as had been agreed with the Huguenot party. The reconciled French, however, turned jointly against the English garrison. Le Havre&#x27;s fortifications would have needed major expansion and repair to withstand a prolonged siege. Still, Dudley tried his best until the town&#x27;s walls were crumbling under French bombardment. The Queen permitted him to surrender honourably in July 1563 on account of the plague that was decimating his troops. Ambrose Dudley himself had been shot in the leg when parleying with the French and returned to England seriously ill. He wrote to his brother that he was happy &quot;rather to end my life upon the breach than in any sickness... Farewell my dear and loving brother, a thousand times.&quot; Robert Dudley went to welcome him at Portsmouth despite the plague and much to Elizabeth&#x27;s annoyance.

Politically, the expedition had been a disaster, yet Warwick gained recognition for his leadership since morale had been high and the civilian population had been treated with unusual respect. The Earl&#x27;s rewards were the Welsh lordship of Ruthin and the Order of the Garter, which was awarded to him while still in France in April 1563. His war injury—which never properly healed—made him ineligible for posts like Lord President of the Council of the North or Lord Deputy of Ireland when they were suggested for him in the future. Elizabeth Lady Tailboys had also died while her husband was in France, and on 11 November 1565 Ambrose Dudley married for the third time. His bride was the 16-year-old Anne Russell, daughter of Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford. Robert Dudley, meanwhile Earl of Leicester, had arranged the match. It was an extraordinary court event. In between tournaments and banquets, the bride was given away by the Earl of Leicester in the presence of the Queen; she later became one of Elizabeth&#x27;s closest friends.

In November 1569, the Northern Rebellion broke out with the aim to install Mary, Queen of Scots (who was in English captivity) on the English throne. The Earl of Warwick was one of the commanders appointed to march against the revolt, which was disintegrating rapidly, though. Due to his bad health, Warwick was soon allowed to return to his Midlands estates. In January 1570, Robert, Earl of Leicester, saw his reconvalescent brother at Kenilworth and reported to Elizabeth: &quot;all this hard weather [he] hath every day travelled on horse, Your Majesty&#x27;s service hath made him forget his pain... assuredly he is marvellous weary, though in my judgment it hath done his body much good&quot;.

As Master of the Ordnance, Warwick presided over an increasingly important government department, which centrally managed the storage and commissioning of the state&#x27;s artillery, munitions, and small arms. Prince William of Orange valued English cannons, and Warwick—who fervently believed in the international Protestant cause—seems willingly to have supplied him with what he wanted. The Spanish ambassador officially protested against this practice in 1576, since the weapons would have been used against Spanish rule in the Netherlands. In 1573 Warwick was admitted to the Privy Council. His attendance to business was quite regular until it declined sharply due to his deteriorating health in the 1580s. At the 1587 trial of Mary Stuart, he acted as a commissioner and was asked by the Scottish Queen to plead for her with his brother, the absent Earl of Leicester. The day sentence was pronounced on her, Warwick did not attend.

One of Warwick&#x27;s last appointments, in January 1588, was Keeper of the Queen&#x27;s parks at Grafton Regis with the lawns, chases, and walks.

==Private nobleman==
Ambrose Dudley became one of the leading patrons of moderate Puritanism, the principal concern of which was the furtherance of preaching. Discouraged by the official Church, this was largely dependent on private initiatives by influential noblemen. In 1567, the two Dudley earls, together with local gentry, founded a consortium which provided for &quot;the preachers of the Gospel in the county of Warwick.&quot; Ambrose Dudley also helped the preacher John Field when he got into trouble over a subversive book he had published in 1565; and when he was imprisoned in 1572, Leicester and Warwick worked his transfer into comfortable confinement in a London alderman&#x27;s house before he was released altogether by his patrons&#x27; means. Like his brother, Ambrose Dudley invested in exploration and privateering voyages; in Martin Frobisher&#x27;s 1576 search for the Northwest Passage, he was the principal patron, although he contributed only the relatively modest sum of £50.

The two Dudley brothers were on the closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: &quot;there is no man [that] knoweth his doings better than I myself&quot;, while Robert&#x27;s recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: &quot;him I love as myself&quot;. Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brother—and stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: &quot;the Lord of Warwick&#x27;s bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick&#x27;s closet, the Lord of Warwick&#x27;s dining parlour&quot;. In the administration of their lands, the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were &quot;almost inseparable&quot;, passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen&#x27;s wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: &quot;if I were you... I would go to the furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do.&quot;

After his first marriage, Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband&#x27;s junior, turned out to be a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especially—which was represented by the earldom of Warwick—filled them with pride. Ambrose&#x27;s childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen&#x27;s displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester&#x27;s estate—and debts—passed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother&#x27;s illegitimate teenage son Robert, who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick&#x27;s death.

From the 1570s the Earl of Warwick often resided at North Hall, his house in Northaw, Hertfordshire. He travelled little as he was often unable to move about, having &quot;no use of his legs&quot;. At the end of January 1590, he finally had his gangrenous leg amputated; as a consequence, he died at Bedford House in the Strand, London, on 21 February. Two days before, the diplomat Sir Edward Stafford visited him and described his spasms and pain &quot;which lasted him unto his death&quot;. He also saw the Countess sitting &quot;by the fire so full of tears that she could not speak&quot;. The Earl of Warwick was buried in the Beauchamp Chapel of Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, in the vicinity of his ancestor Richard Beauchamp, his brother Robert, and his little nephew Robert Dudley, Lord Denbigh, Leicester&#x27;s son who during his short life had been heir to both Dudley earldoms. Ambrose Dudley&#x27;s widow commissioned his monument, but on her request was buried with her ancestors in Chenies, Buckinghamshire, when she died in 1604. Ambrose Dudley entered tradition as the &quot;Good Earl of Warwick&quot;; this probably came about through his quiet life style, which contrasted with the colourful persona of his brother, the Queen&#x27;s favourite.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Eckford (born October 4, 1941) is an American civil rights activist and one of the Little Rock Nine, a group of African American students who, in 1957, were the first black students ever to attend classes at the previously all-white Little Rock Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The integration came as a result of the 1954 United States Supreme Court ruling &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. Eckford&#x27;s public ordeal was captured by press photographers on the morning of September 4, 1957, after she was prevented from entering the school by the Arkansas National Guard. A dramatic snapshot by Will Counts of the &quot;Arkansas Democrat&quot; showed the young girl being followed and threatened by an angry white mob; this and other photos of the day&#x27;s startling events were circulated around the US and the world by the press.

Counts&#x27;s image was the unanimous selection by the Pulitzer jury for a 1958 Pulitzer Prize, but since the story had earned then-rival &quot;Arkansas Gazette&quot; two other Pulitzer Prizes already, the Pulitzer board awarded the prize to another photographer for a pleasant photograph of a two-year-old boy in Washington, D.C. A different photo taken by Counts of Alex Wilson, a black reporter for the &quot;Memphis Tri-State Defender&quot; being beaten by the angry mob in Little Rock the same day, was chosen as the &quot;News Picture of the Year&quot; for 1957 by the National Press Photographers Association. This image by Counts prompted President Dwight D. Eisenhower to send federal troops to Little Rock.

Eckford only spent one year at Little Rock Central High where she and the other black students were tormented throughout. In the years since, she has struggled through life, and twice attempted suicide. She was subsequently diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

==Background==

On September 4, 1957, Eckford and eight other African American students (known as the Little Rock Nine) made an unsuccessful attempt to enter Little Rock Central High School, which had been segregated. An angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school that day, with the complicity of the Arkansas National Guard.

Fifteen-year-old Eckford tried to enter the school, while soldiers of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Orval Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn&#x27;t stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, sat down next to Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, &quot;don&#x27;t let them see you cry.&quot; Soon, she was also protected by a white woman named Grace Lorch who escorted her onto a city bus.

The original plan was to have the nine children arrive together, but when the meeting place was changed the night before, the Eckford family&#x27;s lack of a telephone left Elizabeth uninformed of the change. Instructions were given by Daisy Bates, a strong activist for desegregation, for the nine students to wait for her so that they could all walk together to the rear entrance of the school. This last-minute change caused Elizabeth to be the first to take a different route to school, walking up to the front entrance completely alone. Elizabeth Eckford&#x27;s family was not informed of the meeting and didn&#x27;t know that the school board asked the parents to accompany her. Also, Eckford rode a public bus alone to the segregated school. That day, Elizabeth wore a starched black-and-white dress, and she covered her face under black sunglasses. Elizabeth also held her school book in her hand. As she walked toward the school, Elizabeth was surrounded by a crowd of armed guards and a mob of people, and she did not see any black faces. The mob included men, women, and teenagers (white students) who opposed integration. The white teenagers chanted &quot;Two, four, six, eight, we ain&#x27;t gonna integrate.&quot; Elizabeth attempted to go into the school through the mob but was denied entrance. Eckford walked to a bus bench at the end of the block. Eckford described her experience:

Even though Elizabeth Eckford would one day be known as a member of the Little Rock Nine, at this point in the school day, she was all alone, making her the first African-American student to integrate a white southern high school.

For the next two weeks, the Little Rock Nine stayed home to study instead of going to the Little Rock Central High School. President Dwight D. Eisenhower was reluctant to do anything about the mob or the rioting. Eisenhower summoned Orval Faubus, the Governor of Arkansas to intervene and asked for the withdrawal of all troops from the high school after Elizabeth Eckford&#x27;s experience attempting to enter the school the first time.

On September 23, 1957, the Little Rock Nine approached Central High again, and Elizabeth Eckford along with the other eight students, accompanied by city policemen, were let into the high school through a side door. The reaction from the mob was described as follows:

The Arkansas National Guard, under orders from the governor, and an angry mob of about 400 surrounded the school and prevented them from going in. On September 23, 1957, a mob of about 1000 people surrounded the school again as the students attempted to enter. The following day, President Dwight D. Eisenhower took control of the Arkansas National Guard from the governor and sent the 101st Airborne Division to accompany the students to school for protection. Both federal troops and federalized National Guardsmen were deployed at the school for the entirety of the school year, although they were unable to prevent incidents of violence against the group inside, such as Eckford being thrown down a flight of stairs.

All of the city&#x27;s high schools were closed the following year, so Eckford did not graduate from Central High School. However, she had taken correspondence and night courses garnering enough credits for her high school diploma. In 1958, Eckford and the rest of the Little Rock Nine were awarded the Spingarn Medal by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), as was Ms. Bates.

==Later life==
Eckford was accepted by Knox College in Illinois, but chose to return to Little Rock to be near her family. She later attended Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, where she earned a BA in history. In 2018, Eckford was awarded an honorary doctorate from Knox College.

Eckford served in the United States Army for five years, first as a pay clerk, and then as an information specialist. She also wrote for the Fort McClellan (Alabama) and the Fort Benjamin Harrison (Indiana) newspapers. After that, she has worked as a waitress, history teacher, welfare worker, unemployment and employment interviewer, and a military reporter. In 2007, she was working as a probation officer in Little Rock.

In 1997, she shared the Father Joseph Biltz Award—presented by the National Conference for Community and Justice—with Hazel Bryan Massery, a then-segregationist student at Central High School who appeared in several of the 1957 photographs screaming at the young Elizabeth. During the reconciliation rally of 1997, the two women made speeches together. But later their friendship broke up, with Eckford reflecting, &quot;[Hazel] wanted me to be cured and be over it and for this not to go on anymore. She wanted me to be less uncomfortable so that she wouldn&#x27;t feel responsible.&quot; In 1999, President Bill Clinton presented the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Congressional Gold Medal, to the members of the Little Rock Nine.

On the morning of January 1, 2003, one of Eckford&#x27;s two sons, Erin Eckford, age 26, was shot and killed by police in Little Rock. The &quot;Arkansas Democrat-Gazette&quot; reported that the police officers had unsuccessfully tried to disarm him with a beanbag round after he had fired several shots from his rifle. When Eckford pointed his rifle towards them, the police officers shot him. His mother feared that his death was &quot;suicide by police&quot;. Erin, she said, had suffered from mental illness but had been off his prescribed medication for several years. The newspaper later reported that prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting had decided that the police officers concerned were justified in shooting Eckford.

In 2018, 60 years after leaving Little Rock Central High, Eckford told her story in her first autobiography, &quot;The Worst First Day: Bullied While Desegregating Little Rock Central High.&quot; The book was coauthored with Dr. Eurydice Stanley and Grace Stanley of Pensacola, Florida. Grace was 15 years old when she worked on the project, the same age Eckford was when she desegregated Central High. &quot;The Worst First Day&quot; tells Eckford&#x27;s experiences in verse. It features the graphic artwork of Rachel Gibson and the photography of Will Counts. Eckford traveled to New Zealand in 2019 to teach American civil rights history to more than 4,000 students with Dr. Stanley at the request of high school teacher Roydon Agent, author of &quot;Public Image, Private Shame.&quot;

On November 19, 2022, Elizabeth Eckford spoke at the keel-laying ceremony of the attack submarine USS &quot;Arkansas&quot; (SSN-800) at Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia, after she and Ernest Green, Gloria Ray Karlmark, Carlotta Walls LaNier and Thelma Mothershed-Wair etched their initials onto metal plates that were then welded onto the keel. The plates will remain affixed to the submarine throughout its life. Melba Pattillo Beals and Minnijean Brown-Trickey were also named sponsors of the ship, and all members of the Little Rock Nine were honored. Eckford said &quot;(Former Navy) Secretary Ray Mabus asked us to be supporters of the ship and its crew. I signed on to be a foster grandmother...President Eisenhower sent 1,000 paratroopers to Little Rock to disperse a mob, bring order, and they made it possible for us to enter Central High School. From that point, I&#x27;ve had very high regard for specially trained forces.&quot;

==Media portrayals==
Actress Lisa Marie Russell portrayed Eckford in the Disney Channel movie &quot;The Ernest Green Story&quot; (1993). Amandla Stenberg portrayed Eckford during a segment on the show &quot;Drunk History&quot; (2019).

<text>The Hawthorns is an all-seater football stadium in West Bromwich, West Midlands, England, with a capacity of 26,688. It has been the home of Championship club West Bromwich Albion since 1900, when it became the sixth ground to be used by the club. The Hawthorns was the first Football League ground to be built in the 20th century, opening in September 1900 after construction work took only 4 months. The official record attendance at The Hawthorns stands at 64,815, set in 1937.

Alongside being the home of West Bromwich Albion for over 120 years, The Hawthorns has also hosted a number of England internationals, as well as two FA Cup semi-finals. At an altitude of , it is the highest ground above sea level of all Premier League and Football League clubs.

==Previous grounds==
During the early years of the club, West Bromwich Albion led something of a nomadic existence, playing at five different grounds in a 22-year period. Their first ground was Cooper&#x27;s Hill, which the club occupied from 1878 to 1879. From 1879 to 1881 they played at Dartmouth Park, although they may also have alternated between there and Cooper&#x27;s Hill during this period. Albion&#x27;s third ground was Bunn&#x27;s Field, also known as The Birches, where they played for a single season in 1881–82. With a capacity of 1500–2000, it was their first enclosed ground, allowing the club to charge an entrance fee for the first time. The increasing popularity of football led the well-established West Bromwich Dartmouth Cricket Club to rent their Four Acres ground to Albion from 1882 to 1885, but they quickly outgrew their new home and soon needed to move again. Albion&#x27;s tenure of Stoney Lane, from 1885 to 1900, was arguably the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, as the club won the FA Cup twice and were runners-up three times.

==History==
===20th century===

The expiry of the lease on Stoney Lane, as well as the club&#x27;s desire for a more spacious location, saw them move once again in 1900, this time permanently. All of Albion&#x27;s previous grounds had been close to the centre of West Bromwich, but on this occasion they took up an &quot;out of town&quot; site on the borders of Handsworth and Smethwick. The area was covered in hawthorn bushes, which were cleared to make way for the new ground, hence its name, the Hawthorns. The club signed a lease for the land on 14 May 1900, giving them the option to buy within 14 years from the owner, Sandwell Park Colliery, and Albion did indeed buy the freehold on the ground in June 1913.

When opened, the Hawthorns could hold around 35,500 spectators. The first match took place on Monday 3 September 1900, when Albion drew 1–1 with Derby County in front of a crowd of 20,104. Derby&#x27;s England international Steve Bloomer scored the first Hawthorns goal, with Chippy Simmons equalizing for Albion. The first Saturday game followed soon after, with Albion losing out 0–1 to fierce local rivals Aston Villa in front of a capacity crowd, officially put at 35,417 but with many more forcing entry and an estimated 15,000 people locked out. The 1900–01 campaign was not a successful one however, as Albion finished bottom of the table and were relegated to Division Two. Their defeat to Sheffield United on the final day of the season was witnessed by just 1,050 spectators, which remains the record lowest crowd for a league game at the Hawthorns.

The ground was gradually expanded and 1923 saw the first ever 50,000+ gate with 56,474 watching a 2–1 win in the cup against Sunderland. The first 60,000+ gate followed in 1925, with 64,612 fans watching a cup tie with arch-rivals Aston Villa. The all-time attendance record at the Hawthorns was set on 6 March 1937, when 64,815 spectators crammed in to see Albion beat hot-favourites Arsenal 3–1 in the FA Cup quarter-final. This record was likely bettered when Albion played Newcastle United in an FA Cup fifth round tie in 1954, when over 80,000 people are believed to have been in attendance. However, the official crowd was registered as 61,088. The highest ever league crowd was for a 1–1 draw 60,945 against Wolves on 4 March 1950.

Concrete terracing was added to the ground in 1920. In 1949 the ground became the first in Britain to have an electronic turnstile aggregator fitted, in order to automatically calculate attendances. In 1957 electric floodlights were erected, at a cost of £18,000. The ground&#x27;s first floodlit match saw Albion draw 1–1 with Chelsea, on 18 September 1957. Soon afterwards a friendly game against the Russian Red Army was organised to officially open them. Albion won 6–5 in front of 53,805 fans.

The ground was once divided by the Birmingham/Smethwick border, but was moved completely into the latter by a minor rationalisation of local government borders in the 1960s and is now entirely in Sandwell. In 1964 the large Handsworth Side terrace was replaced by the Rainbow Stand at a cost of £40,000, reducing capacity to around 50,000. In October 1968, closed-circuit television was installed at the ground, in an attempt to ward off &quot;increasing hooliganism&quot;. Over the following decades capacity was further reduced and perimeter fences were built to help tackle hooliganism. The Halfords Lane stand was rebuilt in two separate phases between 1979 and 1982, at a cost of around £2.5 million.
By the end of the 1980s, the capacity had been slashed dramatically to just over 30,000, with attendances frequently dropping below half that figure. The Hawthorns was become increasingly dilapidated and in need of modernisation. Following the Taylor Report in January 1990, the ground became all-seated with first the Smethwick End and then the much-loved Birmingham Road End terraces being demolished and replaced by all-seater stands, giving it a capacity of more than 25,000 by the mid-1990s. The official re-opening of the redeveloped ground saw Albion beat Bristol City 1–0 on Boxing Day in 1994.

===21st century===
Albion celebrated the stadium&#x27;s centenary on 3 September 2000 by beating Crystal Palace 1–0 in a Division One match. In 2001 the Rainbow Stand was replaced by the new East Stand, raising the capacity to 28,003. In 2002, the Hawthorns became the first ground to install big screens in the widescreen format. The ground hosted its first Premier League match on 24 August 2002, with Albion losing 3–1 to Leeds United. Leeds player Harry Kewell scored the first Premier League goal on the ground. The Jeff Astle gates, which commemorate one of Albion&#x27;s greatest strikers, were unveiled on 11 July 2003. The gates are located on the Birmingham Road, close to the Woodman Corner, and form the entrance to the East Stand car park. In December 2003, the board of directors unveiled plans to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 40,000 all-seated. However, these plans were scrapped as Albion slipped out of the Premiership in 2006.

There had been plans for the Halfords Lane Stand to be rebuilt, but these were shelved due to what Albion chairman Jeremy Peace called &quot;continuing levels of excess capacity&quot;. The stand was instead refurbished and became known as the West Stand, with the capacity reduced to 26,272. Plans were again announced to expand capacity after West Bromwich finished in their highest league position since 1983. The plans involved an increase of capacity to around 30,000 by 2014, regardless of league performance. However, this never materialised and the Hawthorns still awaits its first major development in nearly two decades.

On 6 November 2014 a statue of Tony Brown, Albion&#x27;s record appearance maker and goalscorer, was revealed.

In April 2017, The Hawthorns was listed by &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine as the best stadium of all 92 in the Premier League and English Football League, citing it to be &quot;modern and atmospheric&quot;.

==Stands and features==

===West Stand===

Constructed: 1979–1982&lt;br&gt;
Refurbished: 2008&lt;br&gt;
Capacity: 4,725 (seated)

Running along the west edge of the pitch and along Halford&#x27;s Lane, the West Stand (formerly the Halford&#x27;s Lane Stand) provided VIP seating before the advent of the new East Stand. The stand houses the main TV cameras as well as the press and commentary area. Chairman Jeremy Peace had announced plans for the Halfords Lane Stand to be demolished to make way for a single-tier, 10,000 seated stand, raising the total stadium capacity to around 32,000. However, following Albion&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, this plan has been shelved, despite Albion regaining their top flight status in 2008. The stand has instead been refurbished, cutting capacity from 28,003 to 26,272. The old name of the stand also provided the names for the names for the three aging detectives in New Tricks. Jack Halford (James Bolam) Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong) and Gerry Standing (Denis Waterman).

===Birmingham Road End===

Constructed: 1994&lt;br&gt;
Capacity: 8,286 (seated) (including Woodman Corner)

Affectionately called the Brummie Road by supporters, the Birmingham Road End runs behind the goal, adjacent to the A41. Traditionally, it housed the core of the home support and was the main source of the so-called Albion roar. When a terrace, it held up to 14,000, but the stand which replaced it in 1994 holds 8,000 all-seated spectators.

Between this stand and the East Stand lies the Woodman corner, named after the Woodman pub which stood just behind it until its demolition in 2004. The Woodman corner is home to a large throstle mascot, which was originally perched above the old (terraced) Woodman corner scoreboard. The throstle effigy first appeared in 1979 and has been a familiar sight in the stadium since.

===Smethwick End===

Constructed: 1994&lt;br&gt;
Capacity: 5,200 (seated)

Running behind the goal at the southern edge of the pitch, the Smethwick End houses away supporters, though they are only allocated part of the stand, except for cup matches. The remainder houses the most vocal of Albion&#x27;s home support. Development in the summer of 2014 increased the stadium capacity to 26,850, with added seats made available in the Smethwick End due to the movement of the police control room.
===East Stand===

Constructed: 2001&lt;br&gt;
Capacity: 8,791 (seated)

Replacing the old Rainbow Stand, the East Stand now houses the club&#x27;s administration offices, club shop, club ticket office and corporate entertainment suites. The wings of the East Stand are known as the Woodman corner (which joins up with the Birmingham Road End, and is named after the Woodman public house that stood there until 2004) and the Millennium Corner (adjacent to the Smethwick End).

The Rainbow Stand was built in 1964, originally known as the East Stand, but gained the name Rainbow Stand over the next few years owing to its brightly painted seats. It originally consisted of standing accommodation in the lower section and seating in the upper section. However, a refurbishment project in 1977 saw the terracing replaced by executive boxes and seating. It survived until 2000, when it was demolished to make way for the new stand which opened in the 2000–01 season.

===Tony &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Brown statue===
A statue dedicated to Albion&#x27;s record appearance maker and goalscorer, Tony Brown, is situated outside the stadium&#x27;s East Stand. The statue depicts Brown scoring his second goal in Albion&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Valencia in the last-16 tie of the 1978–79 UEFA Cup. The statue&#x27;s plaque acknowledges his appearance and goalscoring figures, as well as major honours won whilst at the club.

It also contains a quote from Brown:

===Jeff Astle gates===

The Jeff Astle gates were built in honour of one of the club&#x27;s most beloved players. They are located on the Birmingham Road, close to the Woodman Corner. The gates feature Astle&#x27;s celebratory pose after his winning goal in the 1968 FA Cup Final. The gates have also become an unofficial location for tributes and makeshift memorials, most notably following the death of another of Albion&#x27;s great strikers, Cyrille Regis.

===Memorial Garden===
A small memorial garden is located in the corner of the East Stand car park, adjacent to the meeting of the East Stand and Smethwick End.

===Baggies Brick Road===
The pavement running along the front of the East Stand is made up of individual bricks containing the names of supporters.

==Other uses==
===Football===
As well as serving as the home ground of West Bromwich Albion, the Hawthorns has hosted a number of other football matches. It has hosted three full England internationals: on 21 October 1922, England beat Ireland 2–0, while on 8 December 1924 they won 4–0 against Belgium. The ground also hosted the first post-war match between England and Wales on 20 October 1945, in which England lost 0–1 to Wales in front of 54,611 people. The Hawthorns hosted a &#x27;B&#x27; international for the first time in February 1998, when England B lost 2–1 to Chile. Two months later, a women&#x27;s international friendly was hosted, Italy winning 2–1 against England.

====Full England international matches====
Two FA cup semi-finals have been staged at the ground. The first saw Derby County draw 1–1 to Sheffield United in 1902, and the second took place between Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1960. Wolves won 1–0 in front of 55,596. The Hawthorns also staged the FA Trophy final replays of 1987 and 1988.

On 11 January 1987, Telford United (a non-league side playing some 30 miles away in Shropshire), switched their FA Cup tie against Leeds United to the Hawthorns as they had refused to host it at their own stadium due to concerns over hooliganism.

===Other sports===

The ground has additionally been the venue for other sporting events. In its early years, the ground was used for athletics meetings; in May 1908, Birchfield Harriers used the Hawthorns for their Spring Meeting, which included the end of the first marathon to be run in the Midlands. The runners covered from Coventry to the Hawthorns, and one of them – Jack Price of Small Heath Harriers – was selected for the British team for the London Olympic Games on the strength of his performance.

In the late 1970s the Hawthorns was the venue for a cricket match between India and Pakistan, watched by 2,641 spectators, while in 2000 and 2001 the ground hosted Kabaddi tournaments. During the mid-late 1990s there were proposals for Moseley Rugby Football Club to share the ground, but these never materialised.

==Transport==
===Train / Tram===

The stadium is served by The Hawthorns station, which is both a railway station and West Midlands Metro tram stop. The station is approximately from the ground. Due to the large number of fans travelling in both directions to and from The Hawthorns on matchdays, trains run more frequently at those times, and have been known to depart every ten minutes. That has helped to reduce the time taken for travelling fans to leave West Bromwich and return home.

===Bus===
National Express West Midlands bus service 74, which runs between Birmingham and Dudley, passes the stadium along the A41 Birmingham Road. NXWM bus service 89, running between West Bromwich and Birmingham, passes near to the stadium.

Previously NXWM ran 79 from Birmingham to Wolverhampton and 78 Birmingham and Wednesbury both of which would have stopped outside the ground, due to Midland Metro running between Birmingham to Wolverhampton these services no longer run with the exception of the 79 which only covers part of the route from West Bromwich to Wolverhampton

===Car===
The ground is less than half a mile from Junction 1 on the M5 motorway.

<text>Term life insurance or term assurance is life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period of time, the relevant term. After that period expires, coverage at the previous rate of premiums is no longer guaranteed and the client must either forgo coverage or potentially obtain further coverage with different payments or conditions. If the life insured dies during the term, the death benefit will be paid to the beneficiary. Term insurance is typically the least expensive way to purchase a substantial death benefit on a coverage amount per premium dollar basis over a specific period of time. 

Term life insurance can be contrasted to permanent life insurance such as whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, which guarantee coverage at fixed premiums for the lifetime of the covered individual unless the policy is allowed to lapse due to failure to pay premiums. Term insurance is not generally used for estate planning needs or charitable giving strategies but is used for pure income replacement needs for an individual. 
Term insurance functions in a manner similar to most other types of insurance in that it satisfies claims against what is insured if the premiums are up to date and the contract has not expired and does not provide for a return of premium dollars if no claims are filed. As an example, auto insurance will satisfy claims against the insured in the event of an accident and a homeowner policy will satisfy claims against the home if it is damaged or destroyed, for example, by fire. Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.

==Usage==
Because term life insurance is a pure death benefit, its primary use is to provide coverage of financial responsibilities for the insured or his or her beneficiaries. Such responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, consumer debt, dependent care, university education for dependents, funeral costs, and mortgages. Term life insurance may be chosen in favor of permanent life insurance because term insurance is usually much less expensive (depending on the length of the term), even if the applicant is higher risk, such as being an everyday smoker. For example, an individual might choose to obtain a policy whose term expires near his or her retirement age based on the premise that, by the time the individual retires, he or she would have amassed sufficient funds in retirement savings to provide financial security for the claims.

==Annual renewable term==
The simplest form of term life insurance is for a term of one year. The death benefit would be paid by the insurance company if the insured died during the one-year term, while no benefit is paid if the insured dies one day after the last day of the one-year term. The premium paid is then based on the expected probability of the insured dying in that one year.

Because the likelihood of dying in the next year is low for anyone that the insurer would accept for the coverage, purchase of only one year of coverage is rare.

One of the main challenges to renewal experienced with some of these policies is requiring proof of insurability. For instance the insured could acquire a terminal illness within the term, but not actually die until after the term expires. Because of the terminal illness, the purchaser would likely be uninsurable after the expiration of the initial term, and would be unable to renew the policy or purchase a new one.

Some policies offer a feature called guaranteed reinsurability that allows the insured to renew without proof of insurability.

A version of term insurance which &quot;is&quot; commonly purchased is &quot;annual renewable term&quot; (ART). In this form, the premium is paid for one year of coverage, but the policy is guaranteed to be able to be continued each year for a given period of years. This period varies from 10 to 30 years, or occasionally until age 95. As the insured ages, the premiums increase with each renewal period, eventually becoming financially inviable as the rates for a policy would eventually exceed the cost of a permanent policy. In this form the premium is slightly higher than for a single year&#x27;s coverage, but the chances of the benefit being paid are much higher.

===Basic pricing assumptions for annual renewable term life insurance===

Actuarially, there are three basic pricing assumptions that go into every type of life insurance:

# Mortality—How many individuals will die in a given year using a large sample size—EG, The 1980 CSO Mortality Table or the newer 2001 CSO Mortality Table which are compiled by the FDC. Most life insurance companies use their own proprietary mortality experience based on their own internal set of statistics. The CSO Mortality Tables reflect total population figures within the US and do not reflect how a life insurance company screens its applicants for good health during the policy underwriting phase of the policy issue process. Corporate mortality will most likely always be more favorable than CSO tables as a result. In rare cases some companies have recently increased policy mortality costs on existing business segments due to much lower than anticipated investment returns,
# Assumed Net Investment Return—EG Current industry average return of 5.5% Annual Yield by the life insurance company. In the early 1980s interest/return assumptions were well over 10% to be sustained over the life of the policy.
# Internal Administrative Expenses—Generally these are proprietary figures which include, mainly, policy acquisition costs( sales commissions to selling agents and brokers),and general home office expenses.
These pricing assumptions are universal among the various types of individual life insurance policies. It&#x27;s important to understand these components when considering term life insurance because there is no cash accumulation component inherent to this type of policy. Buyers of this type of insurance typically seek the maximum death benefit component with the lowest possible premium.

In the competitive term life insurance market the premium range, for similar policies of the same duration, is quite small. 
All of the above referenced variations of term life policies are derived from these basic components.

==Level term life insurance==
More common than annual renewable term insurance is guaranteed level premium term life insurance, where the premium is guaranteed to be the same for a given period of years. The most common terms are 10, 15, 20, and 30 years.

In this form, the premium paid each year remains the same for the duration of the contract. This cost is based on the summed cost of each year&#x27;s annual renewable term rates, with a time value of money adjustment made by the insurer. Thus, the longer the period of time during which the premium remains level, the higher the premium amount. This relationship exists because the older, more expensive to insure years are averaged, by the insurance company, into the premium amount computed at the time the policy is issued.

Most level term programs include a renewal option and allow the insured person to renew the policy for a maximum guaranteed rate if the insured period needs to be extended. The renewal may or may not be guaranteed, and the insured person should review the contract to determine whether evidence of insurability is required to renew the policy. Typically, this clause is invoked only if the health of the insured deteriorates significantly during the term, and poor health would prevent the individual from being able to provide proof of insurability.

Most term life policies allow conversion to permanent life insurance. By using the convertible term life insurance provision, the insured can convert a term life policy into a Universal Life or Whole Life policy. This option can be useful to a person who acquired the term life policy with a preferred rating class and later is diagnosed with a condition that would make it difficult to qualify for a new term policy. The new policy is issued at the rate class of the original term policy. This right to convert may not extend to the end of the Term Life policy. The right may extend a fixed number of years or to a specified age, such as convertible to age seventy.

==Return premium term life insurance==

A form of term life insurance coverage that provides a return of some of the premiums paid during the policy term if the insured person outlives the duration of the term life insurance policy.

For example, if an individual owns a 10-year return of premium term life insurance plan and the 10-year term has expired, the premiums paid by the owner will be returned, less any fees and expenses which the life insurance company retains. Usually, a return premium policy returns a majority of the paid premiums if the insured person outlives the policy term.

The premiums for a return premium term life plan are usually much higher than for a regular level term life insurance policy, since the insurer needs to make money by using the premiums as an interest free loan, rather than as a non-returnable premium.

==Payout likelihood and cost difference==
Both term insurance and permanent insurance use the same mortality tables for calculating the cost of insurance, and provide a death benefit which is income tax free. However, the premium requirement for term insurance is substantially lower for younger individuals than those for permanent insurance.

The reason the costs for term life insurance are substantially lower for younger individuals is due to the low chance they will die during the contracts term. Permanent life insurance programs are designed so the policy owner contributes more premiums than what the cost of insurance is in younger years so that those premiums, and any earning they generate, will offset the cost of insurance in later years when the insured is older and the average mortality rate is higher. The cash value build up in a permanent life insurance is a result of the additional contributions and their earning made to the policy that exceed the cost to insure the individual in any given year. 

As a norm from Income Tax under Section 10(10D), when the beneficiary receives the death benefit under a term life insurance policy, they are not subject to pay tax on the amount received. The death benefit received is not added to taxable income. However, any interest that it accumulates over or any estate additions caused by it is liable to be taxed.

Some permanent universal life insurance policies do not accumulate cash values to stay active for long periods of time. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;term-for-life.&quot; It is important to understand these policies could expire without value if the insured lives past the stated guaranteed period. The insurance company that manufactures these types of universal life contracts offer the policy owner a guarantee that, as long as premiums are paid on as required, the death benefit will be paid to beneficiaries if the insured dies while the contract is active. If the contract expires and the insured is still living, the life insurance policy ends without value. If the insured person dies and the policy has cash value, the cash value is retained by the insurance company who pays out only the stated death benefit listed on the policy. The beneficiaries do not receive both. 

Death benefits are paid out income tax free, in addition to the policy face amount.

== Simplified issue insurance ==
A scaled back underwriting process that is simplified. Coverage amounts are lower than traditional fully underwritten policies. Simplified issue policies typically do not require a medical exam and have fewer application questions to answer. Many of these policies can be approved within several days.

== Guaranteed issue insurance ==
A life insurance policy that is guaranteed approval. Coverage amounts will be lower than traditional policies. Premiums will be considerably higher. Since there are no medical questions and everyone is approved, these policies will have a waiting period before benefits are paid out. If the insured dies during the initial waiting period, only premiums plus interest will be returned. Once the waiting period has been satisfied, the full death benefit will be paid out to the beneficiary.

== Coverage for suicide ==
Most state laws require that a carrier make payment for life insurance claims that happen past two years of coverage for suicidal death. It is in the best interests of the policy owner for them to report depression or any use of anti-depression medication during the physical exam or for underwriting even if the policy owner receives a less than a favorable rate. All individual life insurance policies have a suicide clause in them. If suicide is not covered, more than likely a return of premium is owed to the beneficiary.

<text>Oleic acid is a fatty acid that occurs naturally in various animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is an odorless, colorless oil, although commercial samples may be yellowish due to the presence of impurities. In chemical terms, oleic acid is classified as a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid, abbreviated with a lipid number of 18:1 &quot;cis&quot;-9, and a main product of Δ9-desaturase. It has the formula . The name derives from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, which means oil. It is the most common fatty acid in nature. The salts and esters of oleic acid are called oleates. It is a common component of oils, and thus occurs in many types of food, as well as in soap.

== Occurrence ==
Fatty acids (or their salts) often do not occur as such in biological systems. Instead fatty acids such as oleic acid occur as their esters, commonly triglycerides, which are the greasy materials in many natural oils. Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fatty acid in nature. It is found in fats (triglycerides), the phospholipids that make membranes, cholesteryl esters, and wax esters.

Triglycerides of oleic acid comprise the majority of olive oil (about 70%). It also makes up 59–75% of pecan oil, 61% of canola oil, 36–67% of peanut oil, 60% of macadamia oil, 20–80% of sunflower oil, 15–20% of grape seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, 40% of sesame oil, and 14% of poppyseed oil. High oleic variants of plant sources such as sunflower (~80%) and canola oil (70%) also have been developed. Karuka contains 52.39% oleic acid. It is abundantly present in many animal fats, constituting 37 to 56% of chicken and turkey fat, and 44 to 47% of lard.

Free oleic acid occurs in oils and fats as a product of the breakdown of triglycerides. Olive oil exceeding 2% free oleic acid is graded unfit for human consumption. See . It is a chemical signal use by some ants.

Oleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in human adipose tissue, and second in abundance in human tissues overall, following palmitic acid.

== Production and chemical behavior ==
The biosynthesis of oleic acid involves the action of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA 9-desaturase acting on stearoyl-CoA. In effect, stearic acid is dehydrogenated to give the monounsaturated derivative, oleic acid.

Oleic acid undergoes the typical reactions of carboxylic acids and alkenes. It is soluble in aqueous base to give soaps called oleates. Iodine adds across the double bond. Hydrogenation of the double bond yields the saturated derivative stearic acid. Oxidation at the double bond occurs slowly in air, and is known as rancidification in foodstuffs and as drying in coatings.

Reduction of the carboxylic acid group yields oleyl alcohol. Ozonolysis of oleic acid is an important route to azelaic acid. The coproduct is nonanoic acid:
Esters of azelaic acid find applications in lubrication and plasticizers.

Neutralizing oleic acid with ethanolamines gives the protic ionic liquid monoethanolamine oleate.

== Related compounds ==
The trans isomer of oleic acid is called elaidic acid or &quot;trans&quot;-9-octadecenoic acid. These isomers have distinct physical properties and biochemical properties. Elaidic acid, the most abundant trans fatty acid in diet, appears to have an adverse effect on health. A reaction that converts oleic acid to elaidic acid is called elaidinization.

Another naturally occurring isomer of oleic acid is petroselinic acid.

In chemical analysis, fatty acids are separated by gas chromatography of their methyl ester derivatives. Alternatively, separation of unsaturated isomers is possible by argentation thin-layer chromatography.

In ethenolysis, methyl oleate, the &quot;methyl ester&quot; of the acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate:

==Dietary sources==
== Uses ==

Oleic acid is used as a component in many foods, in the form of its triglycerides. It is a component of the normal human diet, being a part of animal fats and vegetable oils.

Oleic acid as its sodium salt is a major component of soap as an emulsifying agent. It is also used as an emollient. Small amounts of oleic acid are used as an excipient in pharmaceuticals, and it is used as an emulsifying or solubilizing agent in aerosol products.

=== Niche uses ===
Oleic acid is used to induce lung damage in certain types of animals for the purpose of testing new drugs and other means to treat lung diseases. Specifically in sheep, intravenous administration of oleic acid causes acute lung injury with corresponding pulmonary edema.

Oleic acid is used as a soldering flux in stained glass work for joining lead came.

== Health effects ==
Oleic acid is the most common monounsaturated fat in the human diet (~90% of all monounsaturated fats). Monounsaturated fat consumption has been associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and possibly with increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Oleic acid may be responsible for the hypotensive (blood pressure reducing) effects of olive oil that is considered a health benefit. A 2017 review found that diets enriched in oleic acid are beneficial for regulating body weight.

The United States FDA has approved a health claim on reduced risk of coronary heart disease for high oleic (&gt; 70% oleic acid) oils. Some oil plants have cultivars bred to increase the amount of oleic acid in the oils. In addition to providing a health claim, the heat stability and shelf life may also be improved, but only if the increase in monounsaturated oleic acid levels correspond to a substantial reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid (especially α-linolenic acid) content. When the saturated fat or trans fat in a fried food is replaced with a stable high oleic oil, consumers may be able to avoid certain health risks associated with consuming saturated fat and trans fat.

<doc id="661103" wikidata="Q2474789" url="?curid=661103" title="Aggregate supply">
<text>In economics, aggregate supply (AS) or domestic final supply (DFS) is the total supply of goods and services that firms in a national economy plan on selling during a specific time period. It is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing and able to sell at a given price level in an economy. Together with aggregate demand it serves as one of two components for the AD–AS model.

== Analysis ==
There are two main reasons why the amount of aggregate output supplied might rise as price level &quot;P&quot; rises, i.e., why the &quot;AS&quot; curve is upward sloping:

* The short-run &quot;AS&quot; curve is drawn given some nominal variables such as the nominal wage rate, which is assumed fixed in the &quot;short run&quot;. Thus, a higher price level &quot;P&quot; implies a lower real wage rate and thus an incentive to produce more output. In the neoclassical &quot;long run&quot;, on the other hand, the nominal wage rate varies with economic conditions. (High unemployment leads to falling nominal wages which restore full employment.) Hence, in the long run, the aggregate supply curve is vertical.
* An alternative model starts with the notion that any economy involves a large number of heterogeneous types of inputs, including both fixed capital equipment and labour. Both main types of inputs can be unemployed. The upward-sloping &quot;AS&quot; curve arises because (1) some nominal input prices are fixed in the short run and (2) as output rises, more and more production processes encounter bottlenecks. At low levels of demand, there are large numbers of production processes that do not use their fixed capital equipment fully. Thus, production can be increased without much in the way of diminishing returns and the average price level need not rise much (if at all) to justify increased production. The &quot;AS&quot; curve is flat. On the other hand, when demand is high, few production processes have unemployed fixed inputs. Thus, bottlenecks are general. Any increase in demand and production induces increases in prices. Thus, the &quot;AS&quot; curve is steep or vertical.

== Different scopes ==
There are generally three alternative degrees of price-level responsiveness of aggregate supply. They are:

# &quot;Short-run aggregate supply&quot; (SRAS) — During the short-run, firms possess one fixed factor of production (usually capital), and some factor input prices are sticky. The quantity of aggregate output supplied is highly sensitive to the price level, as seen in the flat region of the curve in the above diagram.
# &quot;Long-run aggregate supply&quot; (LRAS) — Over the long run, only capital, labour, and technology affect the LRAS in the macroeconomic model because at this point everything in the economy is assumed to be used optimally. In most situations, the LRAS is viewed as static because it shifts the slowest of the three. The LRAS is shown as perfectly vertical, reflecting economists&#x27; belief that changes in aggregate demand (AD) have an only temporary change on the economy&#x27;s total output.
# &quot;Medium run aggregate supply&quot; (MRAS) — As an interim between SRAS and LRAS, the MRAS form slopes upward and reflects when capital, as well as labor usage, can change. More specifically, medium run aggregate supply is like this for three theoretical reasons, namely the Sticky-Wage Theory, the Sticky-Price Theory and the Misperception Theory. The position of the MRAS curve is affected by capital, labour, technology, and wage rate.

In the standard aggregate supply–aggregate demand model, real output (Y) is plotted on the horizontal axis and the price level (P) on the vertical axis. The levels of output and the price level are determined by the intersection of the aggregate supply curve with the downward-sloping aggregate demand curve.

== Data ==
In the United Kingdom, aggregate supply data is published in the Office for National Statistics&#x27; &quot;Input–output supply and use tables&quot;.

== Policy interventions ==
Aggregate supply is targeted by government &quot;supply-side policies&quot;, which are intended to increase productive efficiency and hence national output. Some examples of supply-side policies include education and training, research and development, supporting small/medium entreprise, reducing business taxes, undertaking labour market reforms to diminish frictions that may hold down output, and investment in infrastructure. For example, the United Kingdom&#x27;s 2011 Autumn Statement incorporated a series of supply-side measures which the government was undertaking &quot;to rebalance and strengthen the economy in the medium term&quot;, which included extensive infrastructure investment and development of a more educated workforce. Supply-side reforms in the 2015 Budget addressed the nation&#x27;s digital communications infrastructure, transport, energy and the environment. In a speech to the G20 in February 2016, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, urged G20 members &quot;to develop a coherent and urgent approach to supply-side policies&quot;.

Continuing &quot;supply-side reforms&quot; were proposed by Liz Truss and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng as part of their 2022 economic programme, with reference to &quot;a comprehensive package of supply-side reform and tax cuts&quot; being made in the Growth Plan announced on 23 September 2022, and further supply side growth measures promised for October and early November, including measures affecting the planning system, business regulation, childcare, immigration, agricultural productivity and digital infrastructure. However, Larry Elliott in &quot;The Guardian&quot; has described this combination of reforms, reduced regulation and tax cuts as &quot;one huge gamble&quot;. The September Growth Plan commitments were mostly reversed by the Autumn Statement of 17 November 2022, although a limited number of initiatives relating to &quot;supply side growth&quot; were included in the latter statement.

Within the UK government, HM Treasury&#x27;s work on &quot;the supply side&quot; is led by the Enterprise and Growth Unit, working in conjunction with other government departments and public bodies. Sir John Kingman, a former civil servant who has been described as the &quot;champion of HM Treasury&#x27;s supply-side activism&quot;, has referred to concern with &quot;the supply side&quot; as the &quot;third mission&quot; of the Treasury, presenting former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson as a notable example of &quot;those who believe in the importance of supply-side reform&quot;.

&quot;Supply-side pessimism&quot; reflects a concern that productive capacity is lost when unused (e.g. during a recession), so that the economy loses the ability to recover aggregate supply when demand recovers. For example, unused factories are not kept in a state of readiness to be used when an economic upturn begins, or workers miss out on the skills and training which they would normally acquire whilst in work. Spencer Dale, a British economist who sat on the Bank of England&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee between 2008 and 2014, took a pessimistic view of supply-side capabilities during the recession of 2012. Cambridge economist Bill Martin reported on productivity pessimism in 2012, noting that there was an established debate about whether there had been a permanent loss of productive capacity, which was reflected as a continuing level of &quot;uncertainty ... related to the prospects for labour productivity and effective supply&quot; as the economy recovered in 2013.

<doc id="661104" wikidata="Q9287884" url="?curid=661104" title="Henry T. Hazard">
<text>Henry T. Hazard (July 31, 1844 – August 7, 1921) was a California pioneer who became a land developer, a patent attorney and mayor of the city of Los Angeles. He gives his name to Hazard Park in Los Angeles.
==Personal==
===Early===

Hazard was born on July 31, 1844, in Evanston, Illinois, the son of Ariel M. Hazard. He had seven siblings. In 1853 he was brought by his parents in an oxen-drawn covered wagon at the age of about 8 on a two-year trek across the plains via Salt Lake City to a Mormon settlement in San Bernardino, California.

He was about 10 when the family attempted to settle on government land a few miles west of Los Angeles; they soon left for Tulare County, where the younger children, including Henry, went to school.

As well as working for his living, Hazard as a young man began studying law in the office of Volney E. Howard. He attended San Jose State College in 1863–64, then traveled by horseback across the plains again to the University of Michigan, where he earned his law degree.

===Marriages===
====Carrie Geller====
Hazard was married to Carrie Geller, daughter of physician William Geller of Marysville, California, on October 3, 1873. The wedding party left Los Angeles early on a Friday morning, with the groom and his friends &quot;in an elegant barouche, drawn by four horses.&quot; The group of carriages arrived at the Church of Our Saviour in San Gabriel, California, about 8 a.m. and the ceremony was performed by the Rev. H.H. Messenger of that city. A reception lasted until late in the evening, and the wedding party returned to Los Angeles by 2 a.m. Saturday, where the couple stayed at the Pico House.

Carrie Geller Hazard died suddenly in a Los Angeles hospital on April 5, 1914. The couple had no children; her survivors were sisters Sarah E. Dougherty of San Diego, Mrs. P. Amiraux of San Francisco and Susie E. Barrow of Los Angeles and brother J.L. Geller of Los Angeles.

====Mildred Clough====

Hazard and Mrs. Mildred Clough were married on May 5, 1919, in Prescott, Arizona, but the former mayor, age 78, later sued for an annulment on the ground of fraud, charging that she never intended to live with him, that she entered into the marriage only for the &quot;purpose of obtaining support and maintenance and the property of Mr. Hazard&quot; and that the marriage was never consummated. Hazard bequeathed the sum of $1 to Mildred Clough in his will, and it was understood that the annulment suit was settled out of court.

===Homes===
After their marriage in 1873, Henry and Carrie Geller Hazard lived for nineteen years in a home on South Hope Street on property later sold to a Methodist hospital, whose officials found it was &quot;just far enough out to be quiet, just close enough in for convenience.&quot; The Hazards moved in about 1892 to Third and New Hampshire, where they had built a house that was &quot;one of the show places of the city.&quot;

In 1911 Hazard was arrested along with three workmen and appeared in Police Court on a charge of removing earth from his property on West 4th Street and digging a drainage ditch without a permit. In the third of three court appearances, former Mayor Hazard at first claimed the charge was politically motivated but then promised to observe the city ordinance in the future.

Hazard was known for building &quot;one of the most beautiful of the new residential show places of Los Angeles&quot; on thirty acres south of Third Street, between Vermont Avenue and New Hampshire Avenue in the Bimini district, now part of Koreatown. Planned by Eager and Eager architects, the house at 255 South New Hampshire was

of a stately classic design and occupies slightly grounds of between three and four acres in extent. ... with its formal gardens, pergolas, pool and Greek temple, [it] is today one of the most highly improved properties in Los Angeles. ... The reception hall and corridors are in tobasco mahogany and both dining and breakfast-rooms are in Juana Costa mahogany. 

After America&#x27;s entry into the Great War in 1917, the gardens of the Hazard estate, which included &quot;an Italian villa and five acres of sunken gardens,&quot; were given over to vegetables instead of flowers.

Hazard leased the property to actress Fannie Ward about 1919.

===Anecdotes===

* Shortly after graduating from the University of Michigan, Hazard was in Los Angeles when a &quot;battle-scarred&quot; stagecoach was brought into the city after the driver had been killed by Indians. Hazard &quot;mounted the coach seat, and drive back to Arizona with one passenger on the inside.&quot;
* At the outset of the Chinese massacre of 1871 (Los Angeles), Hazard was in a barber&#x27;s chair being shaved when a mob formed outside. &quot;Just as he was, with his face covered with lather ... , he mounted a barrel in the middle of the street and remonstrated with the crowd[,] attempting to stop it. &quot;He was rewarded by being shot at.&quot;
* His &quot;ability in extemporaneous speaking with well known by the public.&quot;
* Hazard kept a &quot;fine string&quot; of racehorses and &quot;frequently entertained friends with anecdotes of the days when he &#x27;wrangled Missouri canaries [mules] with a twenty-foot whip.&#x27;&quot; He later disposed of his horses, bought automobiles and &quot;drove along the highways with the same enthusiasm he [had] displayed in handling his horses.&quot;
* Early in the morning of July 8, 1889, Hazard shot in the back and wounded a man who was in Hazard&#x27;s yard and refused to stop when called to do so.

===Death===

Hazard was &quot;Stricken by paralysis, in his seventy-eighth year,&quot; and died on August 7, 1921, in his &quot;temporary home, 240 South New Hampshire street.&quot; A funeral service was conducted at Bresee Brothers, and burial followed in Evergreen Cemetery.

===Legal aftermath===
====Bequests====

In his hand-written will, Hazard bequeathed half his estate to James Mayzle, &quot;his trusted employee, who had been with him many years.&quot; Mayzle &quot;became associated with Mr. Hazard at the age of 10&quot; and was the petitioner and executor of Hazard&#x27;s will. Another employee, J.L. Geller, the bookkeeper of the Hazard &amp; Miller patent-attorney firm, received &quot;everything appertaining to and connected with patent soliciting business, library furniture furniture, name, etc.&quot;

He left a quarter of his estate to the heirs of his first wife, Carrie G. Hazard, and a quarter to his own heirs, including two sisters, Mary Taft and Abbie J. Lechler.

====Lawsuit====
The Hazard estate was sued by Beulah Slater, who presented a signed agreement that Slater was to act as &quot;companion and secretary, ... accompany him on automobile rides and in general make life enjoyable for an old man.&quot; In the agreement, Hazard &quot;declared his love for Mrs. Slater and also his desire to help the widow of his old friend, Guy Slater.&quot; He gave the woman a check for $25,000 which she agreed not to cash immediately. After his death, she brought suit against the estate, and a jury ruled in her favor. In 1924, however, an appeals court reversed the decision, deciding that a hundred dollars a day was too much to pay.

==Vocation==
===Early===

After Hazard moved to Los Angeles he became a farm laborer and a drover, or mule driver, which at the time paid good money.

===Law and business===

Returning to Los Angeles after earning his law degree in Michigan, Hazard became a criminal lawyer, and at one time received as a fee from a murder defendant a large block of land in what became the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

In the land boom of 1878 in Los Angeles, Hazard became a land-title and patent attorney, becoming wealthy as a result. He had a partnership with Edmund A Strause, which was organized in 1907 and dissolved in August 1914. He sold a partial interest in his business to Herman Miller, and in 1921, he was a partner in the firm of Hazard &amp; Miller.

===Public service===

Hazard was one of the organizers of Los Angeles&#x27;s volunteer fire department. A Republican, he was Los Angeles city attorney in 1880 to 1882, then a member of the California State Assembly for the 77th district from 1885 to 1887 and mayor again in 1889–92.

As city attorney, &quot;he used his knowledge of land titles in compelling local railroads to give back to the city what is now known as Lincoln Park,&quot; and he was responsible for the planting of thousands of eucalyptus trees in Elysian Park.

He favored division of the state into two parts, and he made several trips to Washington, D.C., to lobby for a free harbor at San Pedro. He actively promoted the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s proposal to enter Los Angeles.

Mayor Hazard fostered a law that insisted that the city treasurer deposit funds into banks instead of their being handled at the discretion of the treasurer.

==Hazard&#x27;s Pavilion==
Hazard and George H. Pike bought property at Fifth and Olive Streets in Los Angeles and erected an auditorium called Hazard&#x27;s Pavilion. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter wrote in 1947 that:

Architect Charles F. Whitney caught plenty of scolding from his contemporaries for his &quot;wild&quot; schemes; cantilever balconies that at long last eliminated bothersome pillars, and a great bowed roof with its dome. &quot;Many pessimists,&quot; recalled Boyle Workman, gloomily figured that those galleries were doomed to fall into space.&quot; They didn&#x27;t.

It was the largest auditorium in Southern California and hosted artistic, dramatic, literary, social and political activities. It was replaced by the Philharmonic Auditorium in 1905–6.

==Sketch by Toshio Aoki==

Hazard was one of nine civic or social leaders who were sketched by Japanese-born artist Toshio Aoki when he visited Los Angeles from his San Francisco home in 1895. Of Hazard, Aoki said:

Make him one wise man, one man who has action among other men, much action, much spirit, much wisdom. Am I wrong? I think it is not so when I see his face; he is what you call unselfish, and the man who doe not get rich from his good work for all people He knows much law, and I make him a great man in my native costume. I do more than all. I make him a Buddhist priest—No, no, I do not make him an inner priest. He has the mustache, which he should not have at all. See, I make the Kesa, or robes of the outer priest, upon him. He is learned man and knows the law and the rules of the land.

==Wheel clock==

In 1940 Los Angeles County forest rangers stumbled upon the rusting parts of a 60-foot-diameter &quot;wheel clock&quot; designed by Hazard and overgrown with brush on the side of a hill west of Castaic, California, near the Ventura County border. The axle of the clock was &quot;set parallel to the axis of the earth and at a 90-degree angle to the slope of the mountainside.&quot; The axle was connected to the rim of the wheel by three sets of strut wires. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; report about the discovery went on:

The rim of the wheel was made of five layers of 1x12-inch boards. On the rim . . ., spaced at close intervals, were small hooks on which could be placed weights to balance the wheel. ... the axle had bearings of extreme delicacy which cost $250. 

A neighbor who had participated in setting up the wheel said it was &quot;so delicately balanced that it could be started rotating by the touch of a matchstick and continue to turn in the opposite direction to the rotation of the earth.&quot;

<doc id="661109" wikidata="Q339962" url="?curid=661109" title="Ace Combat">
<text>is an arcade-style combat flight simulation video game series by Project Aces, an internal development team of Bandai Namco Entertainment, formerly Namco. Debuting in 1995 with &quot;Air Combat&quot; for the PlayStation, the series includes eight mainline installments, multiple spin-offs, and other forms of media, such as novels, model kits, and soundtrack albums. Since 2012, the series has been developed primarily by Bandai Namco Studios through its internal development group, Project Aces.

The &quot;Ace Combat&quot; franchise emphasizes fast-paced action and dramatic plots with semi-realistic gameplay; for example, aircraft have flight dynamics controls and can stall, but are also able to carry dozens of missiles. The series features a range of aircraft including accurate or slightly modified representations of modern military aircraft, prototypes that were never adopted (or even built) in real life, and fictional boss-type superweapons. The main series of games is set in &quot;Strangereal&quot;, a fictional universe loosely based on the real world, featuring similar events and entities but with an entirely different history largely centering around advanced technology and the aftermath of an asteroid impact event in the 1990s; however, certain games are set in fictional renditions of the real world.

As of 2023, the &quot;Ace Combat&quot; franchise has shipped over copies worldwide, and has established itself as one of the longest running arcade flight action franchises.

==Setting==
Most installments in the &quot;Ace Combat&quot; series are set in &quot;Strangereal&quot;, the series&#x27; fictional universe. Strangereal&#x27;s Earth features entirely different nations, geography, continents, and history compared to the real world, though some nations, locations, and events are loosely based on those from real life, and most aircraft in the series are real models with few alterations.

Strangereal is very similar to the real modern world, but with significantly more advanced technology that allows for the development of superweapons and theoretical devices such as aerial warships, laser weapons, railguns, submarine and airborne aircraft carriers, orbital weapons, mass drivers, lethal autonomous weapons, nearly-sentient artificial intelligence, and advanced experimental aircraft. Nuclear weapons exist, but international agreements and nuclear terrorism are implied to have inhibited their development and use, resulting in a lack of nuclear deterrence and a greater focus on conventional weaponry in arms races. This makes large-scale interstate warfare common, and many nations field large militaries with diverse equipment, develop superweapons, train elite special forces-esque &quot;ace&quot; fighter squadrons, or hire mercenaries to augment their forces.

Most &quot;Ace Combat&quot; games are set after a 1999 impact event in which the asteroid &quot;Ulysses 1994XF04&quot;, on a collision course with Earth, split into numerous fragments, some of which were destroyed by anti-asteroid weaponry but others still struck the planet, causing widespread destruction and global crises. The international tensions caused by the Ulysses impact and its aftermath play a large role throughout the series, and some of the games&#x27; superweapons are, or originate from, anti-Ulysses devices. Another major event in the series&#x27; continuity is the 1995 &quot;Belkan War&quot;, a World War II-esque conflict in which the advanced ultranationalist nation of Belka attempted to invade neighboring countries during an internal crisis, was repelled by an international coalition, and used nuclear weapons on their own territory to prevent a retaliatory invasion, causing their defeat and earning them global condemnation and scorn; Belkan nationalists seeking revenge for their defeat play major roles in some of the games.

As shown in &quot;Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere&quot;, the nations of Strangereal shown in most of the series are eventually superseded by sovereign megacorporations. Strangereal was later established as part of Bandai Namco&#x27;s &quot;United Galaxy Space Force&quot; shared universe, representing the earliest period in its timeline, in which the nations of Strangereal unite to form a world government around 2090.

&quot;Ace Combat: Joint Assault&quot;, &quot;Assault Horizon&quot;, and &quot;Infinity&quot; are not set in Strangereal, and are instead set in their own fictionalized versions of the real world, albeit with technology similar to Strangereal&#x27;s.

==Games==

* Air Combat (1995) is the debut entry of the series, being released as a launch title for the PlayStation in North America and titled &quot;Ace Combat&quot; in Japan. Produced by Kazumi Mizuno as a port and successor to a 1993 arcade game of the same name, the plot centers around a team of mercenary pilots hired to defeat a terrorist organization that has seized control of the Skully Islands. &quot;Air Combat&quot; introduced the series&#x27; arcade-like gameplay, a contrast to most other flight sim games at the time. In 2005, &quot;Air Combat&quot; was released for Japanese mobile phones under Namco&#x27;s game subscription service.
* Ace Combat 2 (1997) was released for the PlayStation, and created out of Namco&#x27;s dissatisfaction with &quot;Air Combat&quot; from a technical standpoint. Designed by Masanori Kato, &quot;Ace Combat 2&quot; follows Scarface, a mercenary squadron (the same from Air Combat) who are hired again to quell the Usean Coup D&#x27;etat and liberate the continent from the Usean Rebel Forces. The sequel builds upon its predecessor in several ways, adding new mission types, playable aircraft, and multiple difficulty options. &quot;Ace Combat 2&quot; was re-released in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 through &quot;NamCollection&quot;, a Japan-exclusive collection of Namco-developed PlayStation games. In 2011, the game was remade for the 3DS as &quot;Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy&quot;, featuring new levels, an updated plot, and new game mechanics.
* Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere (1999) was published for the PlayStation, being the last game in the series for the console. While the previous two games carry a modern-day aesthetic, &quot;Electrosphere&quot; uses a futuristic aesthetic and setting, and follows a conflict between the megacorporations Neucom and General Resource, and the peacekeeping organization UPEO, in a dystopia where corporations have superseded nation states to compete for power. &quot;Electrosphere&quot; is heavily reliant on story, with branching stage paths and anime-style video emails with full voice acting. The North American version of the game cut down much of its story and content to accommodate for financial constraints.
* Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies (2001) was the first game in the series to be developed by Project Aces, then-known as the &quot;AC04 Project&quot;. Released for the PlayStation 2 and renamed &quot;Ace Combat: Distant Thunder&quot; in Europe, it was the first entry in the series to thoroughly flesh out Strangereal as the main setting. Initially intended as a series reboot, &quot;Shattered Skies&quot; returned to the gameplay structure of &quot;Air Combat&quot; and &quot;Ace Combat 2&quot;, with fast-paced action and mission variety in a more linear plot. The game&#x27;s plot tells the story of Mobius 1, a fighter pilot whose legendary exploits during a continent-wide war become instrumental in stopping the country of Erusea&#x27;s plans to conquer the entire continent of Usea.
* Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War (2004) was released for the PlayStation 2, renamed &quot;Ace Combat: Squadron Leader&quot; for Europe. Produced by Kazutoki Kono and Project Aces, &quot;The Unsung War&quot; is one of the most expansive titles in the series, with over 50 playable aircraft and 32 campaign missions, along with fully-animated cutscenes. The plot follows the members of Wardog Squadron, who uncover a conspiracy fueling a large-scale war between the global superpowers of Osea and Yuktobania. The game also features an arcade mode, following Mobius 1 on a mission to defeat Erusean holdouts. In 2018, Bandai Namco Entertainment rereleased &quot;The Unsung War&quot; for the PlayStation 4 as a pre-order bonus for &quot;Ace Combat 7&quot;, with slight modifications to allow it to run properly on the console&#x27;s hardware.
* Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War (2006) was released for the PlayStation 2, renamed &quot;Ace Combat: The Belkan War&quot; in Europe. It was the last &quot;Ace Combat&quot; game developed by Namco before their assets were folded into Bandai Namco Games, who published the game outside Japan, just a week after its launch in Japan. &quot;The Belkan War&quot; serves as a prequel to &quot;The Unsung War&quot;, combining ideas and mechanics from both it and &quot;Shattered Skies&quot; and explaining plot details and lore mentioned in &quot;The Unsung War&quot;&#x27;s story. The plot, told through retrospective narration, recounts the exploits of Galm Team, a pair of mercenary pilots hired to defend the country of Ustio and its allies from an invasion by Belka in 1995.
* Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception (2006) was released for the PlayStation Portable as the first entry in the series to be released on the PSP. The game features the ability for the player to choose their own route through the campaign, allowing for multiple different mission combinations in each playthrough. Its plot follows a war between the neighboring countries of Aurelia and Leasath, and the actions of Aurelia&#x27;s Gryphus Squadron in the fight against the invading Leasathean forces.
* Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation (2007) was released for the Xbox 360, marking the series&#x27; debut on a Microsoft platform. It was the first &quot;Ace Combat&quot; title to implement online multiplayer and downloadable content, which have become staple inclusions since. Alongside a standalone release, Namco Bandai bundled &quot;Fires of Liberation&quot; with the Ace Edge, a flight stick designed by Hori specifically for the game, and a custom Xbox 360 console faceplate. Its story revolves around an invasion of Emmeria by the neighboring country of Estovakia, and the subsequent efforts of Emmerian forces to take back their country, led by the pilots of Garuda Team. In 2018, Bandai Namco Entertainment re-released &quot;Fires of Liberation&quot; for the Xbox One as a pre-order bonus for &quot;Ace Combat 7&quot;, with slight modifications to allow it to run properly on the console&#x27;s hardware.
* Ace Combat: Joint Assault (2010) was released for the PlayStation Portable as the first game in the series to be set in the real world. The game&#x27;s campaign features cooperative gameplay for up to four players, and new aerial combat mechanics that simplify dogfights. &quot;Joint Assault&quot;&#x27;s plot follows the pilots of Martinez Security, a private military company hired to help defeat a heavily-armed global terrorist force.
* Ace Combat: Assault Horizon (2011) was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, with a later release for Microsoft Windows in 2013 through Steam. &quot;Assault Horizon&quot; features significant gameplay differences compared to other entries in the series, such as a &quot;dogfight mode&quot; and &quot;airstrike mode&quot; to simplify gameplay, a &quot;gritty&quot; &quot;Call of Duty&quot;-esque art direction, and unique turret sections for helicopters, gunships, and bombers, the first time in the series that these types of aircraft are playable. Set in the real world, but in a different universe than &quot;Joint Assault&quot;, the game&#x27;s plot follows the 108th Task Force, a joint coalition of U.S. and Russian forces deployed to defeat heavily-armed insurgencies and criminal organizations.
* Ace Combat Infinity (2014) was released for the PlayStation 3 as the series&#x27; first free-to-play entry. The game featured expansive multiplayer modes and a freemium model. Set in the real world, but in a different universe than &quot;Joint Assault&quot; and &quot;Assault Horizon&quot;, &quot;Infinity&quot; follows the aftermath of a real-world Ulysses incident and the rise of a terrorist organization in devastated Eurasia, with the United Nations enlisting several private military companies to fight back. &quot;Infinity&quot;&#x27;s services were discontinued in 2018, with its plot left on a cliffhanger.
* Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (2019) was published for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC through Steam, and was the first mainline installment released in twelve years. A Nintendo Switch port was published in 2024. &quot;Skies Unknown&quot; was created based on the commercial success of &quot;Ace Combat Infinity&quot;, with its mechanics being borrowed from both it and &quot;Ace Combat: Assault Horizon&quot;. Designed by Project Aces and headed by producer Kazutoki Kono, &quot;Skies Unknown&quot; features multiple additions to the series, including multiple game modes, enhancements to the aircraft tuning concept from &quot;Ace Combat X&quot;, and virtual reality support through PlayStation VR. Returning to the series&#x27; traditional setting of Strangereal, the game, set during a war between Osea and Erusea over a space elevator, follows the exploits of Trigger, an Osean pilot who is tasked with clearing his name after a false accusation of murder lands him in a penal squadron. The game also features three VR missions set five years before the campaign, following Mobius 1&#x27;s continued fight against the Erusean holdouts seen in &quot;The Unsung War&quot;&#x27;s arcade mode.
* An untitled &quot;Ace Combat&quot; entry was confirmed to be in development in August 2021. The new entry is being developed by Namco and ILCA.

=== Title differences ===
Some &quot;Ace Combat&quot; games have differences in their title, depending on the region (NTSC or PAL) the game was sold in:

* The Japanese &quot;Ace Combat&quot; was renamed &quot;Air Combat&quot; in the North American and European releases of the original game. The second game was initially set to be released as &quot;Air Combat 2&quot; in the U.S., but by the time of release the game (and series) switched to using &quot;Ace Combat&quot; internationally.
* In NTSC territories, the fourth installment of the series is known as &quot;Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies&quot;, while in PAL territories the game is known as &quot;Ace Combat: Distant Thunder&quot;. The Spanish version of the game is known as &quot;Ace Combat: Trueno de Acero&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;Ace Combat: Steel Thunder&quot;.
* The NTSC version of the fifth installment of the game is known as &quot;Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War&quot;, while the PAL release was renamed &quot;Ace Combat: Squadron Leader&quot;.
* In PAL territories, the word &quot;Zero&quot; in &quot;Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War&quot; was removed, making it the first game since the series introduction to not have a significant name change in PAL territories.
* &quot;Ace Combat: Assault Horizon Legacy&quot; in English-speaking territories was originally titled &quot;Ace Combat 3D: Cross Rumble&quot; in Japan.

==Printed media==
With the release of &quot;Assault Horizon&quot; in 2011, Project Aces created &quot;Aces at War: A History&quot;, a special artbook detailing the content from &quot;Ace Combat 04&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;Zero&quot; from an in-universe perspective, as well as production commentary. This was packaged with the special editions of &quot;Assault Horizon&quot; released in Japan. &quot;Aces at War: A History&quot; would later be updated and rereleased as part of a special edition of &quot;Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown&quot;.

In March 2012, ASCII Media Works released &quot;Ace Combat: Ikaros in the Sky&quot;. A tie-in novel for &quot;Assault Horizon&quot;, &quot;Ikaros&quot; tells a story of series character Kei Nagase as she participates in the JASDF&#x27;s ASF-X Shinden II fighter program.

==Reception==

&quot;Ace Combat&quot; has been a consistent commercial success, with most mainline installments reaching over one million units shipped. &quot;Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown&quot; is the most successful title with over copies shipped by 2025, followed by &quot;Ace Combat 04: Shattered Skies&quot; and &quot;Air Combat&quot;. The games have sold well predominantly in North America and Japan, where over 75% of all revenue was generated from the series by 2008. In total, the &quot;Ace Combat&quot; franchise has shipped over copies.

<text>Daniel Laurent Schutte is an American composer of Catholic and contemporary Christian liturgical music, best known for composing the hymn &quot;Here I Am, Lord&quot; (1981, also known as &quot;I, the Lord of Sea and Sky&quot;) and approximately 171 other hymns and Mass settings.

==Biography==
Schutte was born in Neenah, Wisconsin, on December 28, 1947, grew up in Elm Grove, Wisconsin, and graduated from Marquette University High School before entering the Society of Jesus.

As a Jesuit seminarian, he was one of the founding members of the St. Louis Jesuits, composers who popularized a contemporary style of church music set to sacred texts sung in English due to the liturgical reforms initiated by the Second Vatican Council. Other members of the St. Louis Jesuits are Bob Dufford, Roc O&#x27;Connor, John Foley, and Tim Manion.

He released ten collections with the St. Louis Jesuits, including a 30th-anniversary collection in 2005. Their second recording, &quot;Earthen Vessels,&quot; sold over one million albums. As a result, beginning with hymnals such as &quot;Glory and Praise&quot;, their music became standard repertoire in Catholic parishes in the English-speaking world.

Schutte left the Society of Jesus in 1986.

Schutte continues as a prolific composer of liturgical music, releasing nine solo collections with OCP Publications. Many of his newer compositions found their way into permanent hymnals and missals. Schutte&#x27;s &quot;Mass of Christ the Savior,&quot; released in 2012, quickly became one of the most widely used Mass Settings throughout the English-speaking world.

Notable Christian artists, including Chris Christian, Amy Grant, and John Michael Talbot, have recorded his compositions. His music is credited in movie and television soundtracks, including Dark Waters, Yes, God, Yes, Everybody Loves Raymond, Will and Grace, and Mistresses.  

In 2009, he wrote &quot;Walking the Sacred Path – Spiritual Exercises for Today,&quot; 2012, &quot;God With Us - A Prayer Book For Advent and Christmas&quot; and, 2014, &quot;From Ashes To Glory - A Prayer Book For Lent and Easter&quot;. With the outbreak of COVID-19, he developed a series of virtual spiritual retreats that gained a worldwide audience.

In addition to his Jesuit formation, Schutte holds two master of arts degrees, one in theology and one in liturgy, from The Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. Schutte is also an alumnus of St. Louis University and Seattle University. He did graduate studies in music composition under the direction of Fr. Kevin Waters S.J. at Seattle University. He was a student of celebrated American painter and artist, Sr. Thomasita Fessler, OSF at Studio San Damiano. He has received four honorary doctoral degrees for his contribution to the life of the church. Two honorary doctorates are in humane letters, and two are in music.

Schutte presently is Composer-in-Residence at the University of San Francisco. He continues to compose new music and write about spirituality.

==Legacy==
Schutte&#x27;s compositions are primarily written for Catholic liturgical use, but over time have been used in Protestant worship. Some of the more notable include &quot;City of God&quot; (1981), &quot;Only This I Want&quot; (1981), &quot;Blest Be the Lord&quot; (1976), &quot;You Are Near&quot; (1971), &quot;Though the Mountains May Fall&quot; (1975), &quot;Sing a New Song&quot; (1972), &quot;Glory and Praise to Our God&quot; (1976), &quot;Here I Am, Lord&quot; (1981), &quot;Table of Plenty&quot; (1992), &quot;River of Glory&quot; (2001), &quot;These Alone Are Enough&quot; (2004), his setting of the Ignatian Suscipe prayer and &quot;Saints and Beloved of God&quot; (2016).

&quot;The St. Louis Jesuit Mass&quot; (1973), co-authored during his collaborative years, was the most-used Mass setting in the United States during the 1970s and 1980s. With the implementation of the Roman Missal, Third Edition in 2012, it wasn&#x27;t easy to revise the original Mass setting text and well-known melody with the new style of the translation, which follow the original Latin texts more closely. The Publisher and composers decided not to publish a revision. &quot;Mass of Christ the Savior,&quot; released in 2012, quickly became one of the most widely used Mass Settings throughout the English-speaking world.
In a circular of July 29, 2008, the Congregation for Divine Worship directed that &quot;in liturgical celebrations, in songs and prayers the name of God in the form of the tetragrammaton YHWH is neither to be used or pronounced.&quot; Schutte agreed with the directive. Accordingly, for Catholic liturgical services, the refrain of Schutte&#x27;s &quot;You Are Near,&quot; which began as &quot;Yahweh, I know you are near&quot; now begins with &quot;O Lord, I know you are near.&quot;

<text>Essentials is the Sony PlayStation budget range in the PAL region, which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Australia and South Asia. It was launched in 1997 as the Platinum range but was later renamed for PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. After reaching the required level of sales, Sony often dropped the prices of the original title to Platinum pricing levels (generally about half of the original retail price), as a way to clear inventory for retailers. Similar budget ranges from Sony include the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;The Best&quot; labels for the North American and Japanese markets, respectively.

== History and requirements ==
Platinum was introduced in January 1997 and the first titles under it were &quot;Air Combat&quot;, &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden&quot;, &quot;Destruction Derby&quot;, &quot;Tekken&quot; and &quot;Wipeout&quot;. To become a Platinum release, it was reported initially that a game required over 400,000 or 500,000 sales in its first six months of release. 

By 2006, the requirements had been revised to over 400,000 sales after six months on the market (PAL region sales in particular; games that sell over 400,000 units in another region alone, such as Japan or the U.S., do not necessarily qualify for a Platinum title). For PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable releases, there is no specific target required to achieve Platinum status as indicated by SCEE Press Releases and the discrepancies between the Platinum status of specific titles and their chart performance.

The Platinum distinction has since been extended, however since 2010 they have been renamed &quot;Essentials&quot; for the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. The first PS3 titles were released on August 1, 2008, namely: &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, &quot;MotorStorm&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Virtua Tennis 3&quot;.

For PlayStation 4 games the name was changed to PlayStation Hits. The first games under the new label were released on 18 July 2018 in PS Store and in retail stores for €19.99 / £15.99 each.

== Design differences ==
Platinum Range titles were recognisable by a platinum/silver coloured band on the game&#x27;s casing, both the front and the spine. The PlayStation design used the same logo that was introduced in early 1997 for all PAL region game cases, the differences being the colouring and that it indicates itself as Platinum. The PlayStation 2 design of the platinum games had a silver band to act as a border and to contain the game&#x27;s original cover, which is shrunk to fill about 75% of the platinum cover. The early platinum games that were released prior to 2003 had the PlayStation logo repeated twice on the front case, once on the platinum border, and once on the original game&#x27;s case. (with the original game&#x27;s case dropping the PlayStation logo after 2002.) In 2005, a new featured layout was introduced; these have a black border, and silver outlines around the shrunken original game cover. There is also a red orb located at the bottom of the original game cover with the words Platinum The Best of PlayStation 2 and Platinum The Best of PSP (PlayStation Portable) for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games respectively. The platinum band can also be seen on the manual. The PlayStation 3 Platinum range box art replaces the black background of the PlayStation 3 logo on the left with a yellow background, and has the original box art shrunk slightly, with a grey border, and a yellow rectangle on top of it, with Platinum The Best of PlayStation 3 written on it.

PlayStation and PlayStation 2 platinum game discs do not feature any of the original game disc design; instead, it is replaced with a simple silver design – which, along with the copyright notices around the edges, features the game&#x27;s name in the centre surrounded by a black outline. PlayStation Portable platinum games use the original UMD games&#x27; disc design whilst PlayStation 3 platinum games use the original disc design with a platinum design on the disc.

<doc id="661139" wikidata="Q1884731" url="?curid=661139" title="Mah">
<text>Mångha (&quot;&quot;) is the Avestan for &quot;Moon, month&quot;, equivalent to Persian Māh (; Old Persian ).
It is the name of the lunar deity in Zoroastrianism. The Iranian word is masculine. Although Mah is not a prominent deity in the Avestan scripture, his crescent was an important symbol of royalty throughout the Parthian and Sassanid periods.

The Iranian word is cognate with the English &quot;moon&quot;, from PIE &quot;*mēns&quot;

==Avesta==

Although there are two Avestan hymns dedicated to the Moon, he is not a prominent divinity. 
In both the third &quot;Nyaish&quot; as well as in the seventh &quot;Yasht&quot;, the &#x27;moon&#x27; more commonly spoken of is the physical moon. In these hymns, the phases of the moon are described at length. Ahura Mazda is described to be the cause of the moon&#x27;s waxing and waning, and the Amesha Spentas evenly distribute the light of the moon over the earth. The Fravashis are said to be responsible for keeping the moon and stars on its appointed course. The sun, moon, and stars revolve around the peak of Hara Berezaiti.

The Moon is however also &quot;bestower, radiant, glorious, possessed of water, possessed of warmth, possessed of knowledge, wealth, riches, discernment, weal, verdure, good, and the healing one&quot;. &quot;During the spring, the Moon causes plants to grow up out of the earth&quot;.
The Moon is repeatedly spoken of as possessing the &quot;&quot; of the primeval bull. This is an allusion to a cosmological drama that is however only properly attested in the texts of Zoroastrian tradition (see below).

==In tradition==

Herodotus states that the moon was the tutelary divinity of the Iranian expatriates residing in Asia Minor. 
The divinity Mah appears together with Mithra on Kushan coins.

In the Zoroastrian calendar, the twelfth day of the month is dedicated to and is under the protection of the Moon.

The Moon plays a prominent role in Zoroastrian cosmogony, in particular as described in detail in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, a text finished in the 12th century. The legend runs as follows: Ahriman (Av: Angra Mainyu) incites Jeh (Jahi) the primeval whore to kill the primordial bovine Gawiewdad (Av. Gavaevodata). Jeh does as told, but as the creature lies dying, the &quot;chihr&quot; is rescued and placed in the care of the moon. This &quot;chihr&quot; is then the &quot;prototype&quot; (&quot;karb&quot;) of all creatures of the animal world.

In the hierarchy of &quot;yazata&quot;s, the Moon is the assistant (or &#x27;cooperator&#x27;, &quot;hamkar&quot;) of Vohu Manah (MP: Bahman), the Amesha Spenta of animal welfare, in particular of cattle. The identification with Vohu Manah - the hypostasis of &quot;Good Purpose&quot; or &quot;Good Mind&quot; - is reflected in other texts where the moon is associated with mental harmony and inner peace.

<text>Uyea () is an uninhabited island, lying south of Unst in Shetland, Scotland.

==Etymology==
The Norn word for an island is &quot;øy&quot;, so Uyea (pronounced &quot;Øya&quot;) simply means &quot;the isle.&quot; This name was given to it by the people of southern Unst as it is the largest island near their shores (excluding Yell), and they thought of Unst itself as the mainland.

==History==

The island was inhabited as early as the Bronze Age, and a chambered cairn can still be seen. In the twelfth century, Saint Olaf&#x27;s chapel overlooking Brei Wick was built.

In 1745, two girls from Uyea rowed to the small island of Haaf Gruney to milk some of the cows grazing here. They were caught in a storm when trying to return, and eventually they found their tiny boat blown to Karmøy in south west Norway. The Uyea girls ended up marrying Karmøy men, and their descendants still live there.

Jack Priest, in his memoir of the isle during World War II, described it as &quot;a beachcomber&#x27;s dream - washed as it is with a westerly Atlantic tide through Bluemull Sound, fed from the east by waters of the Norwegian basin and finally the North Sea pressing up from among the isles through the narrow channel between Yell and Fetlar and feeding Colgrave Sound on the south side of Uyea Isle.&quot;

The island was the home of Sir Basil Neven-Spence, who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Orkney and Shetland from 1935 to 1950.

To the present day, Neven-Spence is the most recent person not from the Liberal Democrats or the Liberal Party to represent the constituency.

<text>Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Hardy is a fictional character best known for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer series of 16 films in which he was played by Mickey Rooney. The main film series was released from 1937 to 1946, with a final film made in 1958 in an unsuccessful attempt to revive the series. Hardy and other characters initially appeared in the 1928 play &quot;Skidding&quot; by Aurania Rouverol. Early films in the series were about the Hardy family as a whole, but later entries focused on the character of Andy Hardy. Rooney was the only member of the ensemble to appear in all 16 films. The Hardy films, which were enormously popular in their heyday, were sentimental comedies, celebrating ordinary American life.

==Theatre==
The Hardy family first appeared in Aurania Rouverol&#x27;s play &quot;Skidding&quot;, which debuted on May 21, 1928, at the Bijou Theatre and ran until July 1929. The original cast included Carleton Macy as Judge Hardy, Clara Blandick as Mrs. Hardy, Charles Eaton as Andy, Joan Madison as Myra, and Marguerite Churchill as Marion. Samuel Marx recommended to MGM that the play be adapted into a film.

==First film==
The initial Hardy film, &quot;A Family Affair&quot; (1937), was based directly on Rouverol&#x27;s play and was produced without a view to producing a series. It featured Lionel Barrymore as Judge Hardy and Spring Byington as Mrs. Hardy, Andy&#x27;s parents, and Margaret Marquis as Andy&#x27;s on-again-off-again sweetheart, Polly Benedict. Several of the actors in this initial Hardy film had been in the 1935 film &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot;, based on Eugene O’Neill’s only comedy: Barrymore, Byington, Rooney, Eric Linden, Cecilia Parker, Charley Grapewin, and Margaret Marquis. (Bonita Granville, who was also in &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; but not in &quot;A Family Affair&quot;, has a major role in the last two original Hardy films, &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Blonde Trouble&quot; and &quot;Love Laughs at Andy Hardy&quot;.)

==Series==

When the series was launched, most of the cast was changed, with the exception of Rooney, Cecilia Parker as Andy&#x27;s older sister Marian Hardy, and Sara Haden as Aunt Milly (except for two films when Betty Ross Clarke appeared as Milly). The second and subsequent films starred Lewis Stone as Judge Hardy, Fay Holden as Mrs. Hardy, and Ann Rutherford as Polly Benedict. The Hardys&#x27; oldest child, married daughter Joan Hardy Martin, appeared only in the first film and was not mentioned in the subsequent films.

Most of the movies were set in the Hardys&#x27; fictional hometown of Carvel, located in Idaho in the original play, but described in the films as being in the Midwest. (In the short film &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, the Hardys are described as living in Los Angeles, with no mention of Carvel.) All of the films were sentimental comedies celebrating ordinary American life. The people in Carvel were generally pious, patriotic, generous, and tolerant. The town represented MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer&#x27;s idealized vision of his adopted country.

The early movies focused on the Hardy family as a whole, but the character Andy soon became the center of the series, and his name was featured in the title of the fourth film and all films from the seventh on. They were instrumental in Rooney&#x27;s rise to stardom. The first two Hardy films dealt with the danger of adultery among the younger generation, but the later ones avoided such controversial themes.

The central relationship in the movies was between Andy and his father. Judge Hardy, played by the grandfatherly looking Stone, was a man of absolute morality and integrity, with a stern demeanor, but a kind heart and droll sense of humor. A typical plot involved Andy getting into minor trouble with money or girls, usually because of youthful selfishness and a willingness to fudge the truth. This would lead to a &quot;man-to-man&quot; talk with his father, after which Andy would do the right thing.

In three films, Rooney was paired with Judy Garland, beginning with &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot;, and continuing with &quot;Andy Hardy Meets Debutante&quot; (1940) and &quot;Life Begins for Andy Hardy&quot; (1941). Garland&#x27;s character, Betsy Booth, is an aspiring singer and she sings in the first two of these films. However, although Garland songs were planned for the final film, they were eventually dropped. Unlike Garland-Rooney films outside of the &quot;Andy Hardy&quot; series, Rooney&#x27;s Hardy character is not a musician, so Garland and Rooney do not perform together in the Hardy films.

Rooney played the character continuously from age 16 to 25, when he appeared in &quot;Love Laughs at Andy Hardy&quot; (1946), in which Andy returned to civilian life after fighting in World War II. Twelve years later, an attempt to revive the series with an older, wiser Andy was made in 1958 with &quot;Andy Hardy Comes Home&quot;, but it turned out to be the final film in the series. Thus, the Andy Hardy series ended with a &quot;To Be Continued&quot;, which indeed has yet to be continued.

==Characters==

* Names in white rectangles show which actors appeared in each film. A dark grey rectangle indicates that the character did not appear in that film.

==Screen debuts==
The Andy Hardy series served as a platform for MGM to introduce new performers, some of whom became stars themselves. As examples, &quot;Love Finds Andy Hardy&quot; (1938) featured Lana Turner in one of her first film appearances, while &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Private Secretary&quot; (1941) launched Kathryn Grayson&#x27;s movie career, and &quot;Andy Hardy&#x27;s Double Life&quot; (1942) marked the screen debut of Esther Williams.

==Other adaptations==
===Public service announcements===
A number of public service announcements involving the Andy Hardy character and his father were shown in theaters in the 1940s. A notable example had Andy trying to persuade his father to give him $200 for a car. Instead, his father took him on a tour of several charities that needed the money more. After each visit to a charity, the car Andy wanted to buy became more and more decrepit.

===Radio series===
From late 1949 into 1952, &quot;The Hardy Family&quot; was syndicated by MGM as a half-hour weekly series on radio, with a cast including Mickey Rooney, Fay Holden and Lewis Stone, and writers including Jack Rubin and Jameson Brewer, directed by Thomas A. McAvity. Radio historian J. David Goldin identifies the personnel and summarizes a dozen episodes, with episode numbers suggested more than 70 episodes were broadcast. Seven episodes of the series are preserved in an Internet Archive collection.

===Comic books===
In June 1947, &quot;Fiction House&#x27;s Movie Comics&quot; published a comic book adaptation of the film &quot;Love Laughs at Andy Hardy&quot;.

Andy Hardy was also the subject of a six issue comic series published by Dell in 1952–1954.

<text>Cymbuliidae is a family of pelagic sea snails or &quot;sea butterflies&quot;, marine gastropod mollusks in the superfamily Cymbulioidea.

== Description ==
Instead of an external calcareous shell, they possess a pseudoconch, consisting of conchiolin, a cartilaginous tissue. The mantle and the gill have disappeared as well. They breathe through the skin. They prefer warm water.

== Distribution ==
Cymbuliidae are found in all marine waters between -54 and 55°N.

== Subfamilies ==
The family Cymbuliidae consists of two following subfamilies (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005):
* subfamily Cymbuliinae Gray, 1840
* subfamily Glebinae van der Spoel, 1976

== Genera ==
Genera within the family Cymbuliidae include:

subfamily Cymbuliinae
* &quot;Cymbulia&quot; Péron &amp; Lesueur, 1810 - type genus of the family Cymbuliidae
** &quot;Cymbulia parvidentata&quot; Pelseneer, 1888 - Distribution: Bermuda, Oceanic. Length: 35 mm.
** &quot;Cymbulia peronii&quot; Lamarck, 1819 - Distribution: Florida, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Oceanic. Length: 65 mm.
** &quot;Cymbulia sibogae&quot; Tesch, 1903 - Distribution: Brazil, Argentina, Oceanic. Length: 24 mm.
* &quot;Corolla&quot; Dall, 1871

subfamily Glebinae
* &quot;Gleba&quot; Forsskål, 1776 - type genus of the subfamily Glebinae
** &quot;Gleba chrysosticta&quot; Troschel, 1854: synonym of &quot;Corolla chrysosticta&quot; (Troschel, 1854)
** &quot;Gleba cordata&quot; Forskål, 1776 - Distribution: Florida, Bermuda, Oceanic. Length: 45 mm.

&quot;Desmopterus&quot; Chun, 1889 is the type genus of the family Desmopteridae.

The species are protandric hermaphrodites. There is no shell, no protoconch and no longer any supporting tissue. The body consists almost completely of the two big parapodia (winglike flaps).

== Species ==
Species within the genus &quot;Desmopterus&quot; include:

* &quot;Desmopterus cirropterus&quot; Gegenbaur, 1855
* &quot;Desmopterus gardineri&quot; Tesch, 1910 - Distribution: Indian Ocean.
* &quot;Desmopterus pacificus&quot; Essenberg, 1919 - Distribution: California, Oceanic. Description: shorter wing plate tentacles.
*&quot;Desmopterus papilio&quot; Chun, 1889 Distribution: Seychelles, Florida, Bermuda, Venezuela, Brazil, Adriatic Sea, tropical and subtropical oceanic waters. Length: body length between 0.5 – 2.0 mm, swimming wings between 2.0- 4.0 mm. Description: There is no shell. The animal has wings that are disc-shaped and transparent. The body is large and situated centrally between the lateral wings. These can unite to form a plate with on each side long, ciliated tentacles trailing behind. Most of the time, &quot;Desmopterus papilio&quot; hangs motionless, but flaps away in a loop pattern when disturbed. There are reddish-brown spots at the margin of the wings.

<doc id="661166" wikidata="Q2166859" url="?curid=661166" title="Trondra">
<text>Trondra is one of the Scalloway Islands, a subgroup of the Shetland Islands in Scotland. It shelters the harbour of Scalloway and has an area of .

==History==
Trondra was becoming rapidly depopulated until 1970, when road bridges were built to neighbouring Burra (West and East) and to the southern peninsula of the Shetland Mainland. Since then the population has recovered from a low of 20 in 1961.

A local community hall was opened in 1986.

==Composition==
Settlements on the island include:

*Burland - Burland houses one of Shetland&#x27;s most popular tourist attractions - the Burland Croft Trail.
*Cauldhame
*Cutts
*Glendale
*Scarfataing
==Geology==
Trondra is made up of steeply inclined dalradian rocks; mainly quartz and mica rich schists but with some crystalline limestone in the north which provide fertile soils around Cauldhame and Cutts. The hills are covered in grass and heather, with trees being few and far between, much like the rest of the Shetland Islands.

==Wildlife==
Trondra supports a number of seabirds including many gulls and black guillemots.

There are many fields of sheep and a few of Shetland ponies throughout the island. There is a variety of other wildlife present on and around the isle, such as hedgehogs, sparrows, starlings, seals and porpoises.

==Leisure activities==
Trondra has 2 rowing teams, male and female, which compete in the summertime rowing regattas around Shetland and the annual &#x27;Round Trondra Race&#x27;.

&quot;Da Peerie Neep&quot; (&quot;The Wee Turnip&quot;) is a recently founded annual event which takes place in the Trondra hall and involves various neep related events such as &quot;Toss the Neep&quot;.

Trondra usually enters a male and female squad in the Scalloway Fire Festival, which takes place in early January each year.

<text>The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (, former German name: &#x27;, FWB&quot;&quot;&#x27;) is the world&#x27;s 3rd oldest and 12th largest stock exchange by market capitalization. It has operations from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm (German time).

== Organisation ==
Located in Frankfurt, Germany, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is owned and operated by Deutsche Börse AG and Börse Frankfurt Zertifikate AG. It is located in the district of Innenstadt and within the central business district known as Bankenviertel.

With 90 percent of its turnover generated in Germany, namely at the two trading venues Xetra and Börse Frankfurt, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is the largest of the seven regional securities exchanges in Germany.

The trading indices are DAX, DAXplus, CDAX, DivDAX, LDAX, MDAX, SDAX, TecDAX, VDAX and EuroStoxx 50.

== Trading venues Xetra and Börse Frankfurt ==
Through its Cash Market business section, Deutsche Börse AG now operates two trading venues at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 
* Xetra is the reference market for exchange trading in German equities and exchange traded funds. In 2015, 90 per cent of all trading in shares at all German exchanges was transacted through the Xetra. With regard to DAX listings, Xetra has 60 per cent market share throughout Europe.[1] Trading times on trading days are from 9.00 a.m. to 5.30 p.m.[2] The prices on Xetra serve as the basis for calculating the DAX, the best-known German share index. Over 200 trading participants from 16 European countries, plus Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates, are connected via Xetra servers in Frankfurt/Main.[3]
* Börse Frankfurt is the trading venue for mainly private investors with more than one million securities of German and international issuers. So-called &quot;specialists&quot; on the trading floor attend to the trading of the securities.

== Market surveillance and protective mechanisms ==
Trading at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is governed by clear rules, which apply equally for all trading participants. Independent market surveillance is made up of the Trading Surveillance Office (HÜSt), the Exchange Supervisory Authority attached to the Hessian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Transportation, and Regional Development, and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).Xetra (trading system)

With a view to improving the continuity of prices and to avoid mistrades, several protective mechanisms are in place for the trading venues Xetra and Börse Frankfurt. These include volatility interruption, market order interruption, and liquidity interruption measures.Xetra (trading system)

== History ==
The origins of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange go back to medieval trade fairs in the 11th century. By the 16th century Frankfurt developed into a wealthy and busy city with an economy based on trade and financial services.

In 1585 a bourse was established to set up fixed currency exchange rates, which is considered to mark the &#x27;birth&#x27; of the stock exchange. During the following centuries Frankfurt developed into one of the world&#x27;s first stock exchanges – next to Amsterdam, London and Paris. Bankers like Mayer Amschel Rothschild and Max Warburg had substantial influence on Frankfurt&#x27;s financial trade.

In 1879 Frankfurt Stock Exchange moved into its new building at Börsenplatz. During the final third of the 19th century, Frankfurt was a major financial center in the Atlantic world.

It was only in 1949 after World War II that the Frankfurt Stock Exchange finally established as the leading stock exchange in Germany with consequently incoming national and international investments.

During the 1990s the Frankfurt Stock Exchange was also bourse for the Neuer Markt (New Market) as part of the worldwide dot-com boom.

In 1993 the &quot;Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse&quot; (Frankfurt Stock Exchange) became Deutsche Börse AG, operating businesses for the exchange.

From the early 1960s onwards the Frankfurt Stock Exchange took advantage of the close by Bundesbank which effectively decided on financial policies in Europe until the introduction of the euro in 2002. Since then the exchange profits from the presence of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt.

In 2002 and 2004 was in advanced negotiations to take over London Stock Exchange, which were broken off in 2005. A further merger bid was blocked by the European Commission in 2017.

<doc id="661175" wikidata="Q5600738" url="?curid=661175" title="Greater St. Louis Area Council">
<text>The Greater St. Louis Area Council (GSLAC) of the Boy Scouts of America was formed in 1911 and is based in St. Louis, Missouri. The council serves Scouts in the St. Louis Metro area, southeast Missouri, and southern and central Illinois.

==History==

GSLAC was formed in 1911 as the Saint Louis Council, BSA.

In September 2016 the Lewis and Clark Council voted to merge with GSLAC, effective January 1, 2017. In September 2018, the Lincoln Trails Council voted to merge into GSLAC, and this took effect January 1, 2019.

Until 2021, GSLAC was part of the BSA&#x27;s Central Region. With the adoption of National Service Territories in June 2021, GSLAC became a member of NST 5.

==Administration==
The council employs Professional Scouters and support staff, who serve under the direction of the Scout executive. Each district in the council is served by a full-time district executive. Larger districts are served by a district director and one or more district executives.

The MacArthur Service Center, which is the council&#x27;s headquarters, is located in the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis. The council also operates field service centers in Cape Girardeau, Herrin, and Decatur.

== District Organization ==
GSLAC has 22 districts and a community outreach program.
== Camps ==
The council operates Beaumont Scout Reservation, S-F Scout Ranch, Camp Lewallen, Camp Pine Ridge, Rhodes-France Scout Reservation and Camp Warren Levis.

=== Irondale Scout Reservation ===
Irondale Scout Reservation was founded in Irondale, Missouri, in 1920. Scouts first started camping in the area in 1913, when it was known as Grenia Springs. Later it would be called Camp Roosevelt, but the Camp Irondale name was adopted in 1920, when land was donated to the St. Louis Council by Clarance Howard.

Legend has it that Camp Irondale built the first Olympic-sized swimming pool not built for the Olympics. The pool opened in 1945 and replaced the previously used spring-fed pool. A crack formed in the pool in the 1970s after the pool was in the city of Irondale&#x27;s control and the pool was rendered unusable. Camp Irondale also had a chapel called Inspiration Hall to serve the Scouts&#x27; religious needs. It has red granite walls and a gravel floor bordered with flagstone.

The camp was closed and sold in 1965 at the end of the summer camp season. The property was sold to a real estate developer and has been developed into a small subdivision, although many features of the camp remain. The climbing tower, water tower, two lakes, many cabins, the chapel, a post office building, a small pavilion, the parade grounds and flag pole, the new pool that opened in 1946, and the springs that were used to create the old swimming pool. There are also 5–15 old buildings including cabins, nature lodge, and the Scoutmaster&#x27;s quarters. The old camp is currently under a very slow renovation. A state grant of approximately $90,000 will be needed to fix the Olympic-sized pool and create a new filtration system. The city of Irondale can&#x27;t afford to fix it by itself and it may not be cost effective for the small town. The Chapel at Irondale has recently been remodeled and rededicated to the city by the Cub Scouts of Pack 697 and Boy Scouts of Troop 697.

In 2010 the Ozark Trailblazers District worked all spring and summer to try to restore parts of the old camp that the city of Irondale still owns. The recreation hall was partly restored, the pool was cleaned of brush and trees, several campsites were created, and camp signs were placed around the camp.

=== Beaumont Scout Reservation ===
The Beaumont Scout Reservation is of Scout property operated by GSLAC. It is located in High Ridge, Missouri.

==== History ====
The property for Beaumont was acquired during the late 1940s. It was dedicated in 1954. The property was the beginning of the period of transition for the St. Louis Council that would continue to 1965 with the dedication of the S-F Scout Ranch and the sale of the Irondale Scout Reservation, Lion&#x27;s Den, and Bereton Explorer Base. Beaumont&#x27;s summer camp is known as Camp May. Camp May was opened as a Boy Scout Camp and served in that capacity until the mid-1980s when its summer programs were redesigned to primarily serve Cub Scouts.

==== Camps and facilities ====
Within Beaumont, there are many campsites and camporee areas, as well hiking trails, climbing tower, low and high ropes course, rifle range, shotgun range, Scoutmaster&#x27;s chapel, maintenance building and ranger&#x27;s station, ranger homes, a mud cave, multiple cabins, and Sverdrup lodge.

=====Camp Grizzly and Cub World=====
Camp Grizzly is a Cub Scout area which includes a program hall, multiple pavilions and campsites, an activity field, a council ring, and Cub World, which is a playground area that is geared towards Cub Scouts and their families. Cub world hosts many day camps each summer including Grizzly Camp, which is the council&#x27;s day camp experience. Grizzly camp includes time at the pool, adult supervision, and a hot lunch every day.

=====Camp May=====
Camp May is a Webelos camp that conducts Webelos week-long and Webelos Mini-camp each summer. Some of the facilities are used for other purposes in the off-season. Camp May contains numerous campsites, a pool and shower houses, a dining hall and education facility, a council ring, a trading post, an activity field, a gazebo, a Scoutcraft cabin, an archery a BB gun range, a rifle range, a shotgun range, a nature lodge, and a flag field. Camp May was originally a Boy Scout Camp when Beaumont first opened in 1954. It was founded to help relieve the over crowded Camps Irondale and Lions Den. With the purchase and popularity of S-F Scout Ranch, the council found themselves struggling to fill weeks of camp at Camp May. To solve the problem, the council needed to find another use for the camp during the summer. In the late 1970s a Cub Scout residential camp pilot program was launched at Camp May. It was so successful that soon Camp May was entirely dedicated to running the program. The Webelos programs offered include a full week and mini week experience. In the mid-1990s Camp May had up to 10 weeks of Cub Scout residential camp in operation during a single summer.

=====Emerson Center=====
Wright Lodge, the original dining hall that had been built with the original purchase of the property, was closed for renovations in August 2004. The building was expanded making more room in the dining hall and adding more training space. The office and kitchen spaces were modernized to meet the present needs of the camp. The lodge reopened in June 2005 as the Beaumont Dining and Education Facility. At the council&#x27;s annual meeting in 2009, it was announced that the building was to be renamed in honor of Emerson Electric Co, which had made a large donation to the council. In September 2009, the center was re-dedicated as the Emerson Center.

Nagel Explorer Base

Nagel Explorer Base is at the east of Beaumont and is primarily used for Exploring and Venturing programs It is also host&#x27;s the council&#x27;s horse camp for one week, annually. Its facilities include adirondacks, a program hall, a rifle range, shotgun range, a horse stable, a program field, a large program pavilion, a horse corral, and an equipment building.

=== S-F Scout Ranch ===
The S-F Scout Ranch or &quot;S Bar F&quot; or &quot;The Ranch&quot; as it is commonly known, is owned and operated by GSLAC. It is located in Knob Lick, Missouri, which is about south of Farmington, Missouri. The property sits in St. Francois County, Missouri and Madison County, Missouri. In its center sits Nim&#x27;s Lake, and running through it is the Little St. Francis River.

==== History ====
A large portion of the former of mine and farm lands owned by the Mine La Motte Company, later the Missouri Metals Corporation, was acquired by the St. Louis Area Council in 1961 through the efforts of the St. Joseph Lead Company and Mr. Elver A. Jones, and an initial gift of the Stix, Baer &amp; Fuller Company by Mr. Arthur B. Baer. The name S-F was derived from the St. Louis department store Stix, Baer and Fuller due to their contribution to help buy the property. The property was dedicated during the Shawnee Lodge fall reunion on September 11, 1965, and opened for summer camp in 1966. The need for this Ranch became imminent as a result of the long range plan conducted by the council in 1959 and 1960. This plan, which encompassed a study of the traditional camp facilities of the council such as Camps Irondale, Lion&#x27;s Den and Brereton, pointed out the need for an area that would be large enough for the council to grow on, and an area large enough to expand the program facilities on, and an area rich enough in history and tradition to offer the incentive for the Scouts of today and tomorrow. The property replaced the Irondale Scout Reservation in nearby Ironton, Missouri which had become too small to serve the needs of the growing Scout Council. Three of the four camps that operate on the property today were a part of the original dedication. Camp Gamble was dedicated on June 17, 1970.

Camp Famous Eagle

Camp Famous Eagle was the first camp to be built. It opened in the summer of 1966. It was named for Morton D. May who was the chairman of the committee to develop the ranch. May had been a huge force in developing the Beaumont Scout Reservation ten years earlier. Because of his efforts the camp at Beaumont was named Camp May. Due to this fact the camp at S-F took the name Camp Famous Eagle, Famous for Famous-Barr (part of the May Department Stores) and Eagle for Eagle Trading Stamps, an in-store promotions at the time. The Fe abbreviation for the camp is also an homage to Camp Irondale through the chemical symbol of iron. A dining hall facility was added to Camp Famous Eagle, opening for the 2015 summer camp season, effectively eliminating patrol method cooking from Famous Eagle.

Camp Sakima

Camp Sakima was the second camp to be built, finishing in time for the first week of campers in the summer of 1966. Camp Sakima is named in recognition of Leif J. Sverdrup who headed the campaign to raise the funds for the Ranch to be built. The Camp was named Sakima, an Indigenous word for chief, his nickname, after concern arose about Scout&#x27;s perceived inability to pronounce his last name.

Camp Sakima was last open as a full camp in 2007. It has been used for the National Youth Leader Training (NYLT) program since 2008. Camp Sakima has recently had some facilities issues, including the need to rebuild a drainage field. After a severe storm in 2008, the Camp Sakima bridge was badly damaged and never repaired. The final pieces of the bridge were demolished in 2014.

John S. Swift Base

The John S. Swift Base also opened in the summer of 1966. It was originally the only camp on the property with a dining hall. It was designed for a high adventure based camp to implement the year-long Exploring program, which would later become the Venturing Program. It is named for John S. Swift, who was the owner of Swift Printing Company. He believed in the value of the Scouting program so much that when approached by the committee to create the Ranch for funds, he happily donated the amount needed for the base.

Camp Theodore R. Gamble

Camp Gamble was dedicated on June 17, 1970. It was built to meet the ever-growing need of space for Scouts that was a result of the Post-World War II baby boom. It was named in memory of Theodore R Gamble who was serving as president of the Council when he died suddenly. He was also president of the Pet Milk Company.

Eugene D. Nims Lake

The S-F Scout Ranch is home to the second largest privately owned man-made lake in the state of Missouri. The lake is an essential part of the aquatic program and was a primary goal held by the Ranch founders. This may be because of the failed attempt to create a lake at the Beaumont Scout Reservation. When the land for the Ranch was discovered it did not have a lake. Fortunately, Mrs. Nims stepped in and donated the $55,000 needed to dam the Wills Branch of the Little St. Francois River. She donated the money to build the lake in name and memory of her husband Eugene D. Nims, the founder of Southwestern Bell Telephone. The first attempt to dam the river failed. Sverdurp engineers designed a second dam that created the lake. The lake has six miles (10 km) of shore line and seven coves. It is home to many aquatic program features.

Huck&#x27;s Cove

S-F has its own water park. It is on the southern tip of Nim&#x27;s Lake. This water park includes: two slides, and a play area with numerous aquatic games and activities.

The Water Treatment Plant

The drinking water on the property comes from the lake. It is treated in a plant located at the Swift Base. The plant is considered a Class C plant by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. If operated at capacity, the plant could serve a town of 10–15,000 people. The treatment process has undergone many renovations in recent years. It was replaced by a membrane system which went online in 2011.

Other areas

S-F has a number of other areas available for Scout use, including a camporee area, cabins, the Londe Adirondacks, treehouses, a climbing and rappelling area, numerous rifle and shotgun ranges, a high and low ropes course, and many hiking trails.

==== Programs and activities ====
===== Boy Scout week-long residential camp =====
Since 2007, Camp Famous Eagle and Camp Theodore R. Gamble have been open. Prior to that, since the 1980s, the three Boy Scout camps (Camp Theodore R. Gamble, Camp Famous Eagle, and Camp Sakima) were open on a rotating basis and only two of them open each summer for Boy Scout Summer Camp.

S-F has long been known for the use of the patrol method. In this model, the core of the summer camp program is the use of the patrol method to cook meals, the menu of which consists of hamsteak, cold cuts, eggs, chicken patties, steakburgers, milk, hot dogs, sloppy joes, and other items. For each meal, Scouts must go to the commissary to pick up the ingredients for their meal. Except for the Sunday meal, which is a meal of spaghetti, green beans, and ice cream cooked by the counslers, the meal is then taken to the campsite and cooked on site in an outdoor kitchen over fires built by other members of the patrol.

Citing lack of interest from units outside of GSLAC, as well as with in, a new dining hall was built beginning in the fall of 2014 for the 2015 season. With this addition Camp Theodore R. Gamble operates as the lone patrol method camp in permanent operation, whereas Camp Famous Eagle operates as a dining hall camp.

Outside of food operations, the two camps operate relatively similarly. The week offers Scouts the chance to earn merit badges, participate in aquatics programs (including a trip to Huck&#x27;s Cove and an evening water carnival), spend time in the field sports area, enjoy an opening and closing campfire program put on by the staff that includes humorous skits and songs, and participate in many other activities. On Thursday nights new members are elected into the Order of the Arrow in a tapout ceremony located at the respective camp&#x27;s cove.

Recent additions to the Boy Scout Camps have included numerous aquatic activities including floating icebergs, stand up paddle boards, and ski boats. In the summer of 2014, the Eagle Shotgun range opened, increasing the shotgun opportunities at both camps.

===== Venturing week-long adventure camp =====
The Swift Base run programs for Venturers, the BSA&#x27;s co-ed program for individuals between the ages of 14 and 21. A typical week for a Swift camper might include rock climbing and rappelling, challenge course, rifle, shotgun, and pistol shooting, horseback riding, water skiing, tubing, wake boarding, knee boarding, mountain biking, and many other fun activities. Venturers are given the opportunity to choose which activities they wish to participate in on a daily basis. Swift is one of only a couple camps in the country running a dedicated Venturing summer camp, at least for multiple weeks. In recent years, Swift has operated four weeks of Venturing programs each summer.

===== Parent N&#x27; Pal =====
A short program lasting about 22 hours that provides a brief introduction to outdoor Scout camping for Cub Scouts and an adult partner. Held twice every summer at all of the camps at the Ranch. Held once a summer at Camp Lewallen.

===== National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) =====
A week long training program six weeks out of every summer by the Council Training Department. It is based on a national syllabus. Starting in the summer of 2012 it began being held at Camp Sakima.

===== Ranger program =====
A traditional program for older Scouts, the Ranger program gets Scouts deep into the backwoods of the undeveloped east side of the property. Scouts are given the opportunity to see parts of the property that they would never get to see, all the while participating in a mountain man style program. Scouts may expect to stay at a new campsite each night and construct a different shelter daily. Activities may include blacksmithing, black-powder rifle shooting, tomahawk throwing, candle making, canoeing, swimming, a Native American-style sweat lodge, fishing, hiking, and many other activities. Scouts who attend the Ranger program learn leadership and team-building skills by working together throughout the week to overcome obstacles.

===== Other programs =====
Each summer other Scout programs are held. Examples include, Catholic Adventure Week, LDS Scout Camp, Shooting Sports Camp, Fishing Camp, and Horse Camp.

==== Administrative ====
The Ranch is led by the ranch director, a professional Scouter who also serves as the director of camping overseeing operations at the council&#x27;s other properties. In its history, the Ranch has been served by eight directors (see chart below). The rest of the Ranch staff are seasonal contract employees that run each camp&#x27;s program.
===== Camp operation =====
Each of the Ranch&#x27;s camps has a camp director who may be a professional Scouter. Each camp has a program director that is the second in command to the camp director. The program director oversees merit badge instruction, campsite program, as well as evening programs that are put on by the staff. The business manager oversees the administration of the camp. There are two commissioners that oversee campsite programs put on by the troop counselors, facilitates leaders meetings, and addresses problems as they come up. The Commissary manager and an assistant run the food service operation in the camp, and the trading post manager and an assistant run the camp store. In addition, the trading post staff assists with food service for the staff. The rest of the staff is divided into program areas. Each area has a director and a certain number of counselors.

=====Swift High Adventure Base=====
Given the very different nature of Swift High Adventure Base, the staff is structured differently. Similar to the Scout camps, Swift has a camp director, as well as a program director, and business manager. The business manager directly runs the camp office and trading post, as well as oversees the kitchen staff of two. The program director oversees the rest of the staff of the camp including a field sports director, aquatics director, and wrangler. The rest of the staff serves as program counselors, generally rotating between program sites including rock climbing, rappelling, high challenge course, low challenge course, aquatics area, and ski/tube boat driving. These program counselors also serve as the campsite counselors for the five campsites.

=====Ranch=====
Chaired by the Ranch Director, the central administrative staff for the Ranch includes the Ranch Business Manager (RBM), Retail Operations Manager (ROM), Counselor In Training (CIT) Director, Retail and Needs Driver, Chaplains, and program personnel for the shotgun, horse, Huck&#x27;s Cove, and Ranger programs. The Ranch has two rangers who live on the property year-round and are responsible for the maintenance of the property, in addition to the operation of the water treatment facility.

=== Camp Lewallen ===

Camp Lewallen is of Boy Scout summer camp property owned and operated by GSLAC. It is located in Silva, Missouri. Camp Lewallen opened in 1936, and was built on land owned by the William Lee Lewallen Family. According to the family, Mrs. Lewallen wanted an adequate road built to their farm, and the best way to do that was to allow the Boy Scouts to have a camp there. The property includes the Earl Jarvis Dining Hall, the towering Mount Logan, Scoutcraft, nature and wayfinder areas. The Trading Post overlooks the pool for Scouts to relax and have a snack. At the shooting sports area Scouts have the chance to shoot a shotgun, a rifle and bow and arrow. At Lake Potashnik, Scouts can canoe, paddleboard, row, fish and kayak. Originally a part of the Southeast Missouri Council, GSLAC took over operation of the property and its programs in 1993. The staff of the camp operates the week-long Boy Scout Residential Camp with dining hall cooking.

=== Camp Pine Ridge ===
Nestled within the heart of the Shawnee National Forest and surrounded by the picturesque Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge, Camp Pine Ridge offers a breathtaking 150-acre haven. Towering pines, an abundance of wildlife, vibrant wildflowers, and captivating sunsets create an enchanting backdrop for visitors. Located along the serene shores of Little Grassy Lake, it’s the perfect location for unforgettable adventures.

== Council Programs ==

=== Activities ===
The council&#x27;s activities committee and other volunteers organize several events throughout the year, including:

* Pinewood derby race in spring
* Scouting for Food drive in November
* Council Recognition Dinner, typically held in May
* Memorial Day Good Turn
* Cub Launch

=== Exploring ===
In addition to the traditional Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, Venturing and Sea Scouts programs, GSLAC also offers several Exploring units sponsored by local hospitals, police departments, and other entities.

An annual Exploring dinner is held to celebrate the program and its partners, and awards are given out to outstanding Explorers.

=== STEM ===
GSLAC has a council-wide STEM Committee, as well as committees in many districts. The councils hosts a STEM Camp each summer at Beaumont.

In addition, the council owns a STEM trailer and van. These include programs like stomp rockets, snap circuits, ozobots, rover robots, sphero robots, 3D pens, hand held microscopes, vortex cannons, and more.

Several STEM universities are also held year-round, where Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA members can complete STEM-based advancement requirements and Nova awards.

=== Order of the Arrow ===
The council is served by four Order of the Arrow lodges: Shawnee Lodge, which serves the Greater St. Louis Metro area, Anpetu-We Lodge which serves southeast Missouri and southern Illinois, Nisha Kittan Lodge which serves southern Illinois and Woapink Lodge which serves central Illinois.

The council is one of the only BSA councils that is home to more than one Order of the Arrow Lodge. Upon completion of the mergers of the early 1990s, it was decided that the council was geographically too large to administer one Order of the Arrow program. The decision was made to merge the Ney-a-Ti lodge, from the Egyptian Council with the Anpetu-We Lodge, and make two lodges within the council. Before the Lewis and Clark Council merger, GSLAC submitted a resolution to National to change the &quot;One Lodge, One Council&quot; policy that is in effect. On January 1, 2019, the Lincoln Trails Council in central Illinois merged into GSLAC. Woapink Lodge became the fourth lodge to serve GSLAC. All four lodges are still chartered by the national office.

==== Anpetu-We Lodge ====
The Order of the Arrow existed at Camp Lewallen prior to the Anpetu-We Lodge. Jonito-Otora (Beaver Club) Lodge No. 100 was chartered to the Southeast Missouri Council on April 5, 1937. At that time, the Order of the Arrow was not endorsed by the Boy Scouts of America, and Jonito Otora was disbanded in 1939 in favor of a similar organization called the Golden Sun. The Golden Sun Honor Society was an integral part of Camp Lewallen. The Golden Sun Warrior Circle still remains and is used as the Ordeal ceremony ring. The Golden Sun was disbanded in 1956 to allow the rechartering of an Order of the Arrow Lodge. The Order of the Arrow was by this time endorsed by the National Council as the official honor camping society, and all councils were encouraged to comply. The Southeast Missouri Council was allowed to keep the number 100 for its lodge number, but the youth members chose to change the name to Anpetu-We, meaning &quot;rising sun&quot;. This was a tribute to the former Golden Sun Honor Society. The Anpetu-We Lodge was chartered on March 5, 1956. When the Southeast Missouri Council merged with the St. Louis Area Council in 1993, the Anpetu-We Lodge was allowed to exist within GSLAC. The Egyptian Council of Southern Illinois merged with GSLAC in 1994. The youth members of the Ney-A-Ti Lodge No. 240, voted to join the Anpetu-We Lodge
===== Chapters =====
Anpetu-We Lodge is divided into five chapters. They are listed below.

* Cherokee
* Egyptian
* Shawnee

* Big Muddy

==== Shawnee Lodge ====
The Shawnee Lodge was formed in 1930 and celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2020. It is a large lodge of approximately 1900 registered members and often draws over 1000 members to its annual Fall Reunion. Several of its members have risen to national positions during its history. In 1986 Steve Meinhold was elected to be the North Central Region Chief, becoming the first Shawnee Lodge member to hold a national position. In 2006, Russ Bresnahan was elected to serve as the central region chief. In the year 2009 Jack O&#x27;Neill served as National Chief, the first Shawnee Lodge member to hold that position. Jack served as section vice chief for one year and Section Chief for two years before being elected National Chief. He was a member of the council&#x27;s Summer Camp staff. He was a part of the Shawnee Lodge Vigil Class of 2008 and is an Eagle Scout from Troop 169, at Assumption Parish in South St. Louis County. In October 2022, the former Shawnee Lodge Chief, Matthew Caldwell, was elected as the first G7 Section Chief. He was re-elected in October 2023 to fulfill a second term, the first from Shawnee to do so since O&#x27;Neill. With hopes of higher office in the year of a Shawnee Lodge Hosted Conclave, he ran for a third term at the 2024 Section G7 Conclave, hosted by Illini Lodge, where he lost in a narrow 14:15 vote. Former Lodge Chief, Neil Maxwell, was elected as Section Vice Chief at this conclave and is currently serving his term through Section Conclave 2025.

<text>, also transliterated or called or , is the Japanese god of fishermen and luck. He is one of the , and the only one of the seven to originate purely from Japan without any Buddhist or Taoist influence.

==Origins as Hiruko==
In medieval times, Ebisu&#x27;s origin came to be tied together with that of &quot;Hiruko&quot;, the first child of Izanagi and Izanami, born without bones (or, in some stories, without arms and legs) due to his mother&#x27;s transgression during the marriage ritual. Hiruko struggled to survive but, as he could not stand, he was cast into the sea in a boat of reeds before his third birthday. The story tells that Hiruko eventually washed ashore—possibly in —and was cared for by the Ainu . It is however believed that Ebisu first arose as a god among fishermen and that his origin as Hiruko was a much later conception, ---after the worship of him had spread to merchants and farmers. It is also theorized that he was originally a god known as &quot;Kotoshironushi no Mikoto&quot;, son of Ōkuninushi. He became one of the &quot;shichifukujin&quot; or the seven gods of fortune, which include Daikokuten, Bishamonten, Benzaiten, Fukurokuju, Jurojin, and Hotei. Ebisu, together with Daikokuten, was considered the most popular of these seven and was venerated in almost every Japanese home.

For some communities, in addition for being a deity of fishing, wealth, and fortune, Ebisu is also associated with objects that would drift ashore from the sea such as logs and even corpses. As part of the &quot;shichifukujin&quot;, Ebisu has three sets of temples and shrines in Tokyo, the Mukojima, Yamate (Bluff), and Meguro sets.

==Legend==
The weak child overcame many hardships, grew legs (and, presumably, the rest of his skeletal structure) at the age of three, and became the god Ebisu. He remains slightly crippled and deaf, but mirthful and auspicious nonetheless (hence the title, &quot;The laughing god&quot;). He is often -depicted wearing a tall hat—the —holding a rod and a large red sea bream or sea bass. Jellyfish are also associated with the god and the fugu restaurants of Japan will often incorporate Ebisu in their motif.

In fishing communities across Japan it is extremely common to see fishermen ritualistically praying to Ebisu before they head out for the day. The fishermen’s relationship with Ebisu is indicative of Japan’s relationship with nature as a whole. Fishermen tell stories of how Ebisu keeps the ocean safe and pristine, pushing debris to the shore. As Ebisu is said to have no arms or legs, fishermen often suggest it takes 7 years for things like screws, bolts, or umeboshi seeds, to turn up on shore as Ebisu carries the seed in his mouth and crawls his way along the ocean floor. For this reason, it is believed that Ebisu becomes enraged whenever people pollute the ocean.

==Cultural relevance==
Ebisu&#x27;s festival is celebrated on the twentieth day of the tenth month, &quot;Kannazuki&quot; (the month without gods). While the other myriad members of the Japanese pantheon gather at The Grand Shrine of Izumo, Ebisu does not hear the summons and is thus still available for worship.

Ebisu is frequently paired with Daikokuten, another of the seven gods of Fortune, in displays of the twin patrons by small shopkeepers. In some versions of the myth they are father and son (or master and apprentice). Also, these two are often joined by Fukurokuju as the &quot;Three Gods of Good Fortune&quot;.

As a form of animal worshipping, Ebisu was often associated with marine megafauna such as whales and whale sharks (hence the latter being called the &quot;Ebisu-Shark&quot;) that bring in masses of fish and protect fishermen. In areas of Northeast Japan, Japanese fishermen opposed whaling, as they believed whales were an incarnation of Ebisu.

Ebisu is depicted or parodied in a wide range of media, from artwork to costumed impersonations at local festivals and in commercial logos and advertisements. One of the most widely recognized product logos is in association with Yebisu beer, which was first brewed in 1890, and was acquired by Sapporo Brewery.

Ebisu is the basis of the name of the clothing brand Evisu.

The B.League professional basketball team Osaka Evessa is named after the local pronunciation of &quot;Ebisu-sama&quot; (as &quot;Ebessan&quot;), reflecting the god’s longstanding importance in the city of Osaka. Team mascot Maido-kun is a stylized, childlike depiction of Ebisu wearing a basketball uniform.

<text>Alliance Air (formerly Air India Regional) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Air India Asset Holdings Limited, a special purpose vehicle formed by the Government of India after the disinvestment of Air India Limited. It was founded in April 1996 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indian Airlines (later merged with Air India in 2011 and remained a subsidiary till 2022) and mainly operates domestic routes as part of the government&#x27;s Regional Connectivity Scheme. Government of India notified Alliance Air as Designated Indian Flag Carrier.

==History==
Alliance Air was founded in April 1996 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Indian Airlines. The parent company wished to make better use of its Boeing 737 fleet, so it wet-leased 12 of these aircraft to Alliance Air. The subsidiary operated its first flight on 15 April 1996. Alliance Air served as a low-cost feeder airline for Indian Airlines, providing connections to the latter&#x27;s hubs from various smaller cities across the country. In 2002, the airline was offering flights to 44 destinations in India utilising a fleet of 11 Boeing 737-200s. On 1 April 1997, Vayudoot Airlines, a joint venture of Air India and Indian Airlines, merged with Alliance Air to serve the regional air routes of Northeast India and several other parts of India.

In November 2013, Air India announced that it would dry lease eight ATR-72 aircraft to replace Alliance Air&#x27;s ageing fleet of ATR 42 and CRJ700 aircraft. The airline inducted its first ATR 72-600 aircraft in to its fleet in December 2014. The last CRJ aircraft was phased out in 2017.

In 2016, the airline was delegated to kick-start the Indian Government&#x27;s Regional Connectivity Scheme to connect unserved and under-served airports in the country. The airline hence placed orders for ten ATR 72 aircraft in October 2016.

Alliance Air began operating its first scheduled international flight from Chennai to Jaffna on 11 November 2019. Alliance Air announced that it had recorded an operating profit for the first time in its history during the 2019-20 fiscal year. The airline made an operating profit of , but still ended the period with a net loss of . The airline stated that it had adopted the new IND AS 116 accounting standard, and would have actually recorded a net profit of under the previous standard.

Alliance Air&#x27;s parent company, Air India Limited, was sold to Tata Sons on 8 October 2021.
However, Alliance Air was not a part of the deal, and was instead transferred to Air India Asset Holdings Limited, a state-owned special purpose vehicle that holds Air India&#x27;s remaining assets and liabilities. &quot;The Economic Times&quot; reported that the government also intended to sell Alliance Air and use the proceeds to pay down AIAHL&#x27;s debt. Alliance Air was valued at around . Alliance Air started functioning independently of Air India on 15 April 2022 and started selling its tickets under the Alliance Air banner.

Alliance Air signed an agreement with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to lease two 17-seater Dornier 228 aircraft in September 2021. The first aircraft was delivered to Alliance Air on 7 April 2022. The Dornier 228 had previously only been used by the Indian Armed Forces but was modified by HAL for commercial operations. Alliance Air deployed the aircraft on a new route connecting Dibrugarh, Assam, and Pasighat, Arunachal Pradesh, on 12 April 2022, becoming the first airline to use an Indian-made aircraft in civil aviation operations and the first commercial airline in the country to operate the Dornier 228 aircraft.

Alliance Air signed a deal in February 2022 to acquire two ATR 42-600 aircraft for serving challenging airfields in the Himalayas.

==Destinations==

Alliance Air operates to 57 destinations in India . It operates regional services in India through its hubs in Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai. The airline started its first international flight from Chennai to Jaffna on 11 November 2019 but temporarily had to halt operations from Chennai due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The connection was eventually resumed on 12 December 2022.

==Fleet==
Alliance Air operates the following aircraft :

===Former fleet===

== Accidents and Incidents ==
On July 17, 2000, Alliance Air Flight 7412, a Boeing 737-200, crashed into a residential area in Patna during its approach, resulting in 60 fatalities, including 5 people on the ground.

<doc id="661187" wikidata="Q583901" url="?curid=661187" title="Swamp rabbit">
<text>The swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), also known as the cane-cutter, swamper, or cane jake, is a large cottontail rabbit found in the swamps and wetlands of the southern United States. The species is herbivorous, territorial, and nocturnal. When threatened, it will take to the water and swim.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
The swamp rabbit was first described in 1874 by John Bachman as &quot;Lepus aquaticus&quot;, having a type locality of &quot;western Alabama&quot;. Other common names of the swamp rabbit are &quot;cane-cutter&quot;, &quot;swamper&quot;, and &quot;cane jake&quot;.

Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus aquaticus&quot;, the nominate subspecies that occupies most of the swamp rabbit&#x27;s recognized distribution, and &quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus littoralis&quot;, which is found only in a narrow band of marshes in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas along the Gulf of Mexico coast.

=== Fossil record ===

&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot; fossils have been identified as early as the Pleistocene epoch, according to a 1940 discovery of molar teeth found in a Missouri deposit dating back to that era. Glaciations during the Illinoian stage likely created refugia that led to the emergence of the swamp rabbit as a distinct species. The Last Glacial Period following the Pleistocene created a hybrid zone in western Georgia, which likely led to the separation of the swamp rabbit from the marsh rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot;), its closest relative.

==Range and habitat==
The swamp rabbit is found in much of the south-central United States and along the Gulf coast. It is most abundant in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, but also inhabits South Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Georgia. It is possibly extirpated from Kansas.

Swamp rabbits mainly live close to lowland water, often in cypress swamps, marshland, floodplain, and river tributaries. Swamp rabbits spend much of their time in depressions which they dig in tall grass or leaves, providing cover while they wait until the nighttime to forage. The swamp rabbit&#x27;s habitat is shared by many other species, and it has thus been suggested for use as an indicator species.

There is concern that swamp rabbits are increasingly becoming exposed to predation, especially during snowy/wintry seasons. Snow cover has shown to increase swamp rabbit mortality by almost two times in the northern extent of their range. This is due mostly to the fact that snow cover constrains hiding ability and availability of food resources.

==Characteristics==

&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot; is the largest of the cottontail species, although its ears are smaller than those of other cottontails. Males are slightly larger than females. The head and back are typically dark or rusty brown or black, while the throat, ventral surface, and tail are white, and there is a cinnamon-colored ring around the eye. While largely similar to eastern cottontails (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;) in appearance, the swamp rabbit differs in the sizes of its ears and skull; the former are much smaller, and the latter is larger. Additionally, the back portions of the swamp rabbit&#x27;s hind legs are orange, in contrast to the tan or white feet of the eastern cottontail.

&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot; males vary in weight from approximately to , with an average of about ; females vary from approx. to , averaging about . &quot;S. aquaticus&quot; ranges in length from approx. to , with an average length of about . Males and females of the species show very little sexual dimorphism in regards to size.

== Ecology and behavior ==

Swamp rabbits are territorial, in contrast to other cottontail rabbits, though they will tolerate some overlap between the home ranges of individuals. These home ranges can vary in size from 1 to 12 hectares. They will mark their territory by &quot;chinning&quot;, or marking objects with pheromones produced from glands near the chin. This behavior is also noted in the European rabbit. Rival males may engage in aggressive encounters that sometimes become violent enough to kill one of the combatants. When fighting, males will stand on their hind legs and use their teeth and claws to inflict wounds on their opponent. They will also jump from the ground and strike with the sharp claws of the hind feet. However, compared to nonviolent displays of dominance and submission, fighting is rare.

Swamp rabbits maintain social order through displays of dominance, and communicate directly through vocalizations such as squeaks, chirps, squeals and alert calls. Higher-ranking males will display dominance over lower-ranking males more frequently, and will move within the home ranges of females more frequently, with the alpha male copulating most often in a given season. When escaping, swamp rabbits will dive into water and swim, sometimes keeping only the nose and eyes above the water.

=== Diet ===
Swamp rabbits are herbivorous; they eat a variety of foraged plants, including grasses, sedges, shrubs, tree bark seedlings, and twigs. They feed mainly at night but rain showers will often cause them to feed during daytime as well. A study has found that the preferred foods of &quot;S. aquaticus&quot; are savannah panicgrass (&quot;Panicum gymnocarpum&quot;), false nettle (&quot;Boehmeria cylindrica&quot;), dewberry (&quot;Rubus trivialis&quot;) and greenbrier (&quot;Smilax bona-nox&quot;).

Like all lagomorphs, the swamp rabbit creates, expels and eats cecotropes to get more nutrition from its food.

=== Reproduction ===
Swamp rabbits are synchronous breeders. Females give birth to altricial young. Young are born with well-developed fur but their eyes are closed and they are immobile. Their eyes have opened by day three and the young have begun walking. They are weaned and leave the nest after about 15 days. Young are sexually mature at seven months and reach adult weight at 10 months. The nests in which the young are born consist of a slight depression in the earth that is filled with grasses mixed with rabbit hair. These nests, also used for thermoregulation, are known as &quot;forms&quot; and are common among the non-burrowing species of rabbit.

Breeding season varies widely across the range of &quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot;, usually occurring anywhere between February and August, but can occur year-round in Texas. Spermatogenesis has been noted to occur in &quot;S. aquaticus&quot; in Missouri in October and November. In a Mississippi study, groups of males harvested in December and February had higher percentages of individuals with descended testes than those harvested in any other months. &quot;S. aquaticus&quot; exhibit induced ovulation and have an hour-long estrus. The gestation period lasts 35 to 40 days. Females can have one to three litters a year with each litter consisting of four to six young. The occurrence of embryo resorption has been seen in &quot;S. aquaticus&quot;; this loss of in-utero litters is attributed to some type of habitat disturbance such as flooding, which may cause overcrowding to occur, as well as directly inducing the release of stress hormones. The swamp rabbit has a diploid chromosome number of 38, similar to the marsh rabbit (&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot;).

=== Predation and parasites ===
Known predators of &quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot; are domestic dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;), American alligators (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), and humans (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;). Feral pigs are also a potential predator. Even though their swimming abilities lack the speed to escape a pack of hunting dogs, swamp rabbits elude pursuers by lying still in the water surrounded by brush or plant debris with only their nose visible. The species is hunted for fur, meat, and sport, and is the second-most commonly hunted rabbit in the United States. Swamp rabbits have several adaptations to avoid predators: cryptic coloration, &quot;freezing&quot;, and rapid, irregular jumping patterns.

&quot;Sylvilagus aquaticus&quot; is susceptible to parasitism from various roundworms in the genus &quot;Brugia&quot;, specifically &quot;B. lepori&quot;, which is endemic to Louisiana. The roundworms live in the subcutaneous and lymphatic tissue of the rabbit. &quot;B. lepori&quot; is also known to affect the eastern cottontail, and is suspected as an agent of human &quot;Brugia&quot; infections in the northeastern United States. &quot;S. aquaticus&quot; is also affected by other internal parasites, including trematodes and cestodes, as well as the parasitic tick &quot;Haemaphysalis leporispalustris&quot;.

== Relationship with humans ==
Of the cottontail rabbits, the swamp rabbit is one of the least studied species. It has an average lifespan of 1.8 years, but individuals living up to 9 years have been recorded. The rabbit is hunted in its native range, both for its products (meat and fur) and for sport, which has been noted as not significantly affecting populations. Agricultural development within its range has caused habitat loss, as these developments both alter the usable habitat and increase severity and frequency of flooding.

=== Conservation ===
&quot;Sylvilagus palustris&quot; is protected by state-level regulations in some areas. In Indiana, it is classified as &quot;State Endangered&quot;, and in Missouri and South Carolina, it is a Species of Special Concern. The International Union for Conservation of Nature considers it a least-concern species .

<text>Northeast Illinois Council is a Boy Scouts of America local council that is headquartered in Vernon Hills, Illinois, United States. 

The council, along with its regular Scouting program, owns and operates Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation near Pearson, Wisconsin, Camp Sol R. Crown near Wilmot, Wisconsin and Camp Okarro in Wadsworth, Illinois. Northeast Illinois Council is served by Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Lodge 40. 

== History ==
The Council, as it currently exists, was formed through the merger of Oak Plain Council and Evanston-North Shore Area Council in 1971.










==District Organization==

The Northeast Illinois Council is composed of three districts, made up of communities along the north shore area. 

Aptakisic District services Bannockburn, Buffalo Grove, Deerfield, Fort Sheridan, Green Oaks, Highland Park, Highwood, Kildeer, Lake Bluff, Lake Forest, Libertyville, Lincolnshire, Long Grove, Mundelein, Riverwoods, and Vernon Hills.

North Star District services Antioch, Beach Park, Fox Lake, Gages Lake, Grayslake, Gurnee, Ingleside, Island Lake, Lake Villa, Lakemoor, Lindenhurst, Millburn, North Chicago, Park City, Round Lake, Round Lake Beach, Round Lake Heights, Third Lake, Volo, Wadsworth, Wauconda, Waukegan, Wildwood, Winthrop Harbor, and Zion.

Potawatomi District services Evanston, Glencoe, Glenview, Golf, Kenilworth, Northbrook, Northfield, Skokie, Wilmette and Winnetka.

==Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation==
Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan Scout Reservation is located near Pearson, Wisconsin, in Langlade County, Wisconsin, United States, on Lake Killian. The Reservation is made up of three separate sub-camps, East Camp, West Camp and Wabaningo. With a size of approximately 1000 acres surrounded by more wooded areas, it offers a Northwoods camping environment, as well as high adventure programs. In a typical summer, the camp is open for six weeks from the middle of June to the beginning of August. In some years, the camp has been open as many as eight weeks or as few as four weeks. 

The main draw of the Reservation is the traditional resident summer camp. In this program, scouts live in campsites, take merit badge classes, and participate in activities with their troops. Also offered are a variety of high adventure programs, and wilderness camping at Wabaningo. Out of the summer season, troops can reserve sites or cabins for camping. 
10
Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan has 12 different program areas that offer over 50 merit badges and activities. Both East and West Camps have their own Aquatics, Ecology Conservation, Handicraft, Pinnacle, Scoutcraft, Shooting Sports and Trailblazer areas. The two camps share a climbing wall, zipline, cycling base, and the Triangle M Horse Ranch. 

=== History ===
Camp Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan was purchased by the North Shore Area Council in the fall of 1928, and opened for campers in Summer 1929. The land purchased had previously been used as a farm, and as a logging camp before its purchase. A vote was held in November 1928 to determine the name for the new camp, with almost 1,000 votes received from Scouts. &quot;Camp Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan&quot; won by a 4 to 1 ratio, beating out other choices &quot;Camp White Eagle&quot; and &quot;Camp Tamarack&quot;. Originally, campers rode a Chicago and Northwestern train from Highland Park to Elcho, a few miles west of the camp. In the 1950s, the camp expanded with the purchase of plots of land on the west coast of Lake Killian. This land acquisition allowed for a second camp, West Camp, to open on the same property in 1959. Around this time, the original property was re-named East Camp. In the 1960s, the North Shore Area Council began acquiring more land, with around 600 acres of land purchased in total. This land, located on the other side of County Highway T, included a former dairy barn, a house, and old logging roads. This new plot of land was named Camp Wabiningo after the former Evanston Council&#x27;s summer camp, which had closed as a part of its merger with the North Shore Area Council.

=== 2019 Storm ===
Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan was in the path of the July 2019 Heatwave Upper Midwest Derecho, and sustained major damage. Many trees were blown over by the wind, and some landed on buildings, tents, or vehicles. Only one injury was reported as a result of these events. A crowdfunding campaign raised over $450,000 USD to repair or replace damaged structures. The total damage was estimated at over $600,000 USD.

== Controversial Alumni ==
At least five former people associated with the council or its predecessors appeared on the ineligible volunteer list (also known as the &quot;perversion files&quot;) maintained by the National Council that were released by court order in 2012.

In September 2018, former Scout Executive George Douglas Nelson was arrested for allegedly transferring council funds to the Miami Valley Council, his former council, to purchase a personal vehicle. He was charged with disbursing charitable funds for personal gain, wire fraud, and forgery. In 2019, Nelson pleaded guilty to forgery, was sentenced to 2 years of probation and ordered to pay restitution to the council.

<doc id="661206" wikidata="Q830576" url="?curid=661206" title="The Girl from Ipanema">
<text>&quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; (), &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, is a Brazilian bossa nova and jazz song. It was a worldwide hit in the mid-1960s and won a Grammy for Record of the Year in 1965. It was written in 1962, with music by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Portuguese lyrics by Vinícius de Moraes. English lyrics were written later by Norman Gimbel.

The first commercial recording was in 1962, by Pery Ribeiro. The Stan Getz recording featuring the vocal debut of Astrud Gilberto became an international hit. This version had been shortened from the version on the album &quot;Getz/Gilberto&quot; (recorded in March 1963, released in March 1964), which had also included the Portuguese lyrics sung by Astrud&#x27;s then-husband João Gilberto. In the US, the single peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and went to number one for two weeks on the Easy Listening chart. Overseas it peaked at number 29 on the UK Singles Chart, and charted highly throughout the world.

Numerous recordings have been used in films, sometimes as an elevator music cliché. It is believed to be the second-most recorded pop song in history, after &quot;Yesterday&quot; by The Beatles. The song was inducted into the Latin Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2004, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. 

In 2000, the 1964 release of the song by Stan Getz &amp; Astrud Gilberto on Verve Records was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==History==
The song was composed for a musical comedy titled &quot;Dirigível&quot; (&quot;Airship&quot;), then a work in progress of Vinicius de Moraes. The original title was &quot;Menina que Passa&quot; (&quot;The Girl Who Passes By&quot;); the first verse was different. Jobim composed the melody on his piano in his new house in Rua Barão da Torre, in Ipanema. Moraes wrote the lyrics in Petrópolis, near Rio de Janeiro, as he had done with &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; (&quot;No More Blues&quot;) six years earlier. While firmly rooted in bossa nova, &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; includes influences from blues and Tin Pan Alley.

During a recording session in New York with João Gilberto, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Stan Getz, the idea of cutting an English-language version came up. Norman Gimbel wrote the English lyrics. João&#x27;s wife, Astrud Gilberto, was the only one of the Brazilians who could speak English well, and was chosen to sing. Her voice, without any of the mannerisms of trained singers, proved a perfect fit for the song. However, she was never credited or received any royalties, and received only $120 for her part.

The key the song is played in has varied depending upon the origin of the recording. While the original Ribeiro version was in the key of G, most Brazilian performances use D♭ and most American versions use F.

Astrud Gilberto and Getz appear as themselves and perform the song in the 1964 film &quot;Get Yourself a College Girl&quot;.

Frank Sinatra recorded the song with Jobim in 1967 for their album &quot;Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antônio Carlos Jobim&quot;. Ella Fitzgerald recorded it for her two-disc set of Brazilian music &quot;Ella Abraça Jobim&quot;, released by Pablo Today in 1981.
Ethel Ennis and Nat King Cole have also both recorded the song. A version by Gary Criss titled &quot;The Girl From Ipanema / Brazilian Nights&quot; from his album &quot;Rio De Janeiro&quot; reached number 19 in the Canadian RPM dance charts in August 1978. Eliane Elias included the song in her albums &quot;Eliane Elias Sings Jobim&quot; (1998) and &quot;Brazilian Classics&quot; (2003).

==Inspiration==
Ipanema is a fashionable neighborhood located in the southern region of the city of Rio de Janeiro.

The song was inspired by Heloísa Eneida Menezes Paes Pinto (now known as Helô Pinheiro), a seventeen-year-old girl living on Montenegro Street in Ipanema. Daily, she would stroll past the Veloso bar-café, not just to the beach (&quot;each day when she walks to the sea&quot;), but in the everyday course of her life. She would sometimes enter the bar to buy cigarettes for her mother and leave to the sound of wolf whistles. In the winter of 1962, the composers saw the girl pass by the bar. Since the song became popular, she has become a celebrity.

In &quot;Revelação: a verdadeira Garôta de Ipanema&quot; (&quot;Revealed: The Real Girl from Ipanema&quot;) Moraes wrote that she was &quot;the paradigm of the young Carioca: a golden teenage girl, a mixture of flower and mermaid, full of light and grace, the sight of whom is also sad, in that she carries with her, on her route to the sea, the feeling of youth that fades, of the beauty that is not ours alone—it is a gift of life in its beautiful and melancholic constant ebb and flow.&quot;

==Legacy==
The legacy of &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; was acknowledged by multiple aspects of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics held in Rio de Janeiro: the Olympic and Paralympic mascots were respectively named Vinicius and Tom after the song&#x27;s co-writers by a public vote, while the Olympics&#x27; opening ceremony featured a segment themed around the song and the architecture of Oscar Niemeyer. Jobim&#x27;s grandson Daniel Jobim performed the song during the segment, which also featured an appearance by Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen. Spotify reported that the song had been streamed on its service 40,000 times per day in the days following the ceremony (a 1200% increase), while in the U.S., the song reached #5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s World Digital Songs chart the following week.

==Legal disputes==
In 2001, the song&#x27;s copyright owners (the heirs of their composer fathers) sued Pinheiro for using the title of the song as the name of her boutique (Garota de Ipanema). In their complaint, they stated that her status as The Girl from Ipanema (Garota de Ipanema) did not entitle her to use a name that legally belonged to them. Public support was strongly in favor of Pinheiro. A press release by Jobim and Moraes, the composers, in which they had named Pinheiro as the real Girl from Ipanema (Garota de Ipanema) was used as evidence that they had intended to bestow this title on her. The court ruled in favor of Pinheiro.

In a separate legal dispute, Astrud Gilberto sued Frito-Lay for trademark infringement for using the song in a TV advertisement for its baked potato chips. Gilberto argued that:[A]s the result of the huge success of the 1964 recording, and her frequent subsequent performances of &quot;Ipanema,&quot; she has become known as The Girl from Ipanema and is identified by the public with the 1964 recording. She claims as a result to have earned trademark rights in the 1964 recording, which she contends the public recognizes as a mark designating her as a singer. She contends, therefore, that Frito-Lay could not lawfully use the 1964 recording in an advertisement for its chips without her permission.In &quot;Oliveira v. Frito-Lay Inc.&quot; (2001), her claims were rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

==&quot;The Boy from Ipanema&quot;==


When sung by female artists the song has often been rendered as &quot;The Boy from Ipanema&quot;. Such artists have included Julie London (1964 single), Peggy Lee (1964), Ella Fitzgerald and The Supremes (1965), Shirley Bassey (1966) and Eartha Kitt (1974). Petula Clark sang it in 1977 on The Muppet Show. Crystal Waters recorded her version in 1996 for the various artists &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot; compilation and was later included on her 1998 greatest hits set. Diana Krall recorded another version on her 2009 album &quot;Quiet Nights&quot;.

The reason for &quot;The Boy from Ipanema&quot; version is partially caused by an awkward translation occurring when female vocalists sing: &quot;But each time when she walks to the sea, she looks straight ahead not at HE.&quot; Some singers have corrected this by singing: &quot;But each time when she goes for a swim, she looks straight ahead not at him.&quot;

A parody of the song, with different lyrics written by Stephen Sondheim, is entitled &quot;The Boy From...&quot;.
Another parody is &quot;The Girl With Emphysema&quot; by comedian Bob Rivers.

The phrase &quot;Boy from Ipanema&quot; — but nothing from the song — appears in Norwegian recording artist Annie&#x27;s &quot;Anthonio&quot;. Likewise, the phrase &quot;Girl from Ipanema&quot; appears in The B-52&#x27;s&#x27; 1985 single &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland,&quot; again without any musical reference to the original song.

<text>The Red Lake Indian Reservation () covers in parts of nine counties in Minnesota, United States. It is made up of numerous holdings but the largest section is an area around Red Lake, in north-central Minnesota, the largest lake in the state. This section lies primarily in the counties of Beltrami and Clearwater. Land in seven other counties is also part of the reservation. The reservation population was 5,506 in the 2020 census.

The second-largest section () is much farther north, in the Northwest Angle of Lake of the Woods County near the Canada–United States border. It has no permanent residents. Between these two largest sections are hundreds of mostly small, non-contiguous reservation exclaves in the counties of Beltrami, Clearwater, Lake of the Woods, Koochiching, Roseau, Pennington, Marshall, Red Lake, and Polk. Home to the federally recognized Red Lake Band of Chippewa, it is unique as the only &quot;closed reservation&quot; in Minnesota. In a closed reservation, all land is held in common by the tribe and there is no private property.

The tribe claims the land by right of conquest and aboriginal title; they were not reassigned to it by the United States government. The Red Lake Band of Chippewa refused to join with six other bands in organizing as the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe in the mid-1930s; at the time, its people wanted to preserve their traditional system of hereditary chiefs, rather than forming an electoral government. As of 2011, the Ojibwe language is the official language of Red Lake. Seven principal clans (doodems) found on the Red Lake Indian Reservation are &quot;makwa&quot; (bear), &quot;mikinaak&quot; (turtle), &quot;owaazisii&quot; (bullhead), &quot;nigig&quot; (otter), &quot;migizi&quot; (eagle), &quot;waabizheshi&quot; (marten), and &quot;ogiishkimanisii&quot; (kingfisher). As a population minority &quot;name&quot; (sturgeon) and &quot;adik&quot; (caribou) clans are also found.

In the 2000 census, Red Lake was the most populous reservation in the state, with 5,162 residents. The only place in Minnesota with a higher Native American population at that time was the state&#x27;s largest city, Minneapolis, 250 miles to the south; it recorded 8,378 Indian residents that year. By 2007, the White Earth and Leech Lake reservations (both led by parts of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe) had higher resident populations of enrolled Ojibwe. The reservation&#x27;s largest community is Red Lake, on the south shore of Red Lake. Given the large lake in the heart of the reservation, its total land area of covers about 70% of the reservation&#x27;s surface area.

== History ==

In the 17th century, the Algonquian-speaking Ojibwe migrated into present-day Minnesota from the north around the Great Lakes. Their warriors went ahead of colonizers and were told to clear the way for the Anishinaabe families. Before invading the Mille Lacs region, Ojibwe warriors had forced their way into the region just west of what is now Duluth, Minnesota, on Lake Superior. They established a village known as &quot;Wi-yah-kwa-kit-chi-ga-ming.&quot; It was later called &quot;Fond du Lac&quot; (Bottom of the Lake) by French fur traders, the first Europeans to interact with the Ojibwe in this area. From there, Anishinaabe warriors invaded the Sandy Lake and Red Lake regions. Their conquest of the Red Lake region may have occurred between 1650 and 1750. By that time, Anishinaabe people were already living in the Grand Portage, Rainy Lake, and Pembina region of present-day northern Minnesota.

After evicting the Dakota living in the Red Lake region, the Noka (the Military and Police totem of the Anishinaabe) occupied the area. They eventually allowed other Anishinaabe totems to enter the Red Lake region to live. Most Anishinaabe immigrants to this area were from the Noka totem (or clan). They established many villages in the Red Lake region. Later, they and their Dakota allies invaded the plains of present-day North Dakota, western South Dakota, and Montana. The Western Dakota, who refused to surrender, continued to fight the Anishinaabe-Dakota alliance. With each battle and defeat, more Dakota asked for peace from the Anishinaabe. The Western Dakota who continued the conflict developed a great hatred for those Eastern Dakota who were allies of the Anishinaabe.

William Whipple Warren, the first historian of the Ojibwe people, noted their longstanding associations with the French Canadians by the mid-18th century, due both to fur trading and intermarriage among their peoples. As a result, the Ojibwe fought with the French during the Seven Years&#x27; War against the English; it was known in North America as the French and Indian War. Although the English won the war and took over &quot;French&quot; territory in Canada and east of the Mississippi River, the Ojibwe retained many trading and family associations with ethnic French Canadians.

===19th century===

In the 1850s two Roman Catholic priests established a mission with the Red Lake band. Later, Catholic nuns from the Benedictine monastery (convent) in St. Joseph founded St. Mary&#x27;s Mission at Red Lake. They organized a boarding school at the mission to serve Ojibwe girls, teaching them Christianity and English. Over time, most residents on the reservation adopted Roman Catholicism, although many also retained Ojibwe rituals and traditions, including funeral and mourning practices.

In 1862 a commission composed of U.S. Senator Wilkinson, Indian Commissioner Dole, and Indian Superintendent Thompson had been selected to make a treaty with the Red Lake Nation, prior to the Sioux uprising. Lincoln sent his private secretary Nicolay to represent him to the Chippewa/Ojibwa peoples. A newspaper reported that the Sioux had learned that a commission had been sent to treat with the Red Lake leaders. The Sioux thought that the commission was going to give their annuities to the Red Lakers and sent a war party to intervene. Both the Red Lake and Pembina bands waited at the agreed treaty location on the Red River. When the Commission failed to show the two bands raided a Red River oxcart train bound for the Fort Garry Selkirk settlement of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Afterwards the Red Lakers objected to the Pembina band taking the cattle and saw to it that the cattle were returned.

Close to this time, the Sioux made a raid on Fort Abercrombie driving off the Fort&#x27;s livestock and horses. Included in this were 200 annuity cattle intended for the Red Lake Chippewa. The cattle had been diverted to Abercrombie for safe keeping from a Sioux attack. 
However, when the Red Lakers were informed that the Sioux actions were the cause of the delay of the Treaty Commission meeting them and their cattle having been taken, they offered to defend the frontier from the Santee Sioux. In 1863 the Pembina Band of Chippewa Indians and the Red Lake Band negotiated the Treaty of Old Crossing in Minnesota with the United States. They agreed to cede their lands in the Red River and Pembina area. They made additional agreements for land cessions in the following decades, under pressure of increased numbers of European-American settlers in the area. The Reverend Bishop Henry Whipple was furious at what the treaty called for.

The United States and the British surveyed the international border to adjust previous errors. The corrected boundary included the Northwest Angle within the United States as well as its native inhabitants, the Bois Forte Band of Chippewa. As the Bois Forte lacked federal recognition from the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Bureau consolidated the small Bois Forte Band with the Red Lake Nation administratively.

While the tribe ceded large tracts of land to the U.S., it maintained a central geographic location. It resisted U.S. attempts to gain its approval for allotment of communal land to individual households under the Dawes Act of 1887. This involved dividing communal tribal land into individual household plots for farming and private ownership. The US would declare any land remaining on the reservation after allocating 160 acres to each head of household as &quot;surplus&quot; and available for sale to non-Indians.

During this period, some of the Pembina band, refused relocation to either Turtle Mountain or the White Earth reservation. They located to the Red Lake Reservation because it was &quot;untouched Indian land.&quot; It has never left tribal control and is unique for that.

On July 8, 1889, the Bureau of Indian Affairs told the Minnesota Chippewa that the Red Lake and White Earth reservations would be retained, but the others would be put up for public sale. They said that Chippewa from the other reservations would be relocated to White Earth. The Bureau told tribal leaders that members of each reservation could vote on whether to accept allotments at that reservation. Voting was limited to all qualified tribal men. The Chippewa leaders were outraged.

Red Lake leaders warned the U.S. Government of reprisals if their Reservation was violated. The members of the White Earth, Mille Lacs, and Leech Lake reservations all voted overwhelmingly to accept land allotments and allow the surplus land sold to the whites, with the tribes to receive lump sums of money from the sales. The October 5, 1898, Battle of Sugar Point was over land.

In 1889, the Red Lake Reservation covered 3,260,000 acres or 5,093 sq. mi. The Band was forced to cede 2,905,000 acres as &quot;surplus&quot; after allotment to households registered on the Dawes Rolls took place. That left the Reservation with over 300,000 acres surrounding most of Lower and Upper Red Lake. Learning of Chippewa unrest because of the vote, the United States later set aside large areas of forests to add back to the Red Lake Reservation. However, in 1904 US officials returned, and forced the band to cede more land from that set aside in 1889. The present Red Lake Reservation dates to the 1904 land act. There was no allotment of land at that time to individual Chippewa living on the Red Lake Reservation.

Only a small portion of the northeast corner of the White Earth Reservation remained. It was a fraction of its original size. All the other Chippewa reservations in Minnesota were closed. The lands were sold following the Nelson Act of 1889. As a result of the 1898 Rebellion on the Leech Lake Reservation, the US changed its policy returning some land to Minnesota&#x27;s remaining Chippewa reservations.

===20th century to present===

The current Red Lake Reservation is entirely owned and occupied by members of the Red Lake Band, making it unique among reservations in Minnesota. As a result of allotment and sales in the intervening years, some tribes own less than 10% of the land within their reservation boundaries. Red Lake is among the most isolated reservations in the United States. In 1934, after the Indian Reorganization Act that year encouraged tribes to restore their governments, the tribe rejected joining six other Chippewa bands to organize the federally recognized Minnesota Chippewa Tribe under a written constitution. Its leaders did not want to give up the tradition of hereditary chiefs for an elected government or give up any control of its land to the Tribe. By 2007, the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe reported a total enrollment of more than 40,000 members.

In the 1950s, new tribal leaders of Red Lake wrote a constitution to establish democratically elected government of chairman and council, without term limits. The tribe elected its first chairman and tribal council in 1959. Roger Jourdain was repeatedly re-elected and retained power until 1990. Under his leadership, the tribe developed infrastructure on the reservation, including running water, roads, and housing.

The tribe has established a library and archives, and appointed a tribal archeologist to study and preserve the archeological artifacts of its people. Tribal schools on the reservation were established so that the children could be educated in their own community through high school.

Red Lake, like the White Earth, and Leech Lake reservations, is known for its tradition of singing hymns in the Ojibwe language.

In part because of the reservation&#x27;s isolation, it has struggled economically. Many people are unemployed. High unemployment has contributed to high rates of poverty, alcoholism, violence and suicide. As a result, since the 1990s, the school board has added classes to the high school curriculum to include drug and alcohol abuse prevention, anti-gang training, anti-bullying training, and instruction about fetal alcohol syndrome. As a result of gang killings in the 1990s, the school added security measures to the high school, including guards.

The Red Lake Band of the Chippewa are the only entity beside state governments and Pacific dependencies currently eligible for SAMHSA Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment block grants

Since the mid-20th century, the tribe has asserted a significant level of sovereignty. Due to its status as a &quot;closed reservation&quot;, the tribe can assert a considerable amount of control over non-residents, including controlling their movements within the reservation or expelling them altogether. As an example, the tribe has barred journalists from entry on several occasions. The prosecution of crimes is often complex due to issues of jurisdiction, which often have to be clarified on a case-by-case basis. The reservation tribal police have jurisdiction over misdemeanors, but the US government, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) police, legally has jurisdiction over felonies. The state of Minnesota has no criminal jurisdiction over the reservation.

Political tensions have sometimes erupted into violence. In 1979, during a struggle over leadership, men with rifles attacked the tribal police station, and two teenagers were killed. One shot himself accidentally and the other was accidentally shot while struggling with a companion over control of a weapon. Men burned several buildings, including the home of the tribal chairman. 
The tribe and reservation was the first in the United States to issue its own vehicle license plates as a measure of its sovereign status. It is struggling to find ways to develop its economy. It is collaborating in the 21st century with the White Earth and Leech Lake bands to reach out to the business and academic communities to promote job development. (See &quot;Economy&quot; below.)

The Red Lake shootings occurred on March 21, 2005, in two locations on the reservation.

==Demographics==
===Population===
According to the 2020 census, the Red Lake Reservation was home to 5,506 individuals. The population density stood at , with 1,591 housing units spread at an average density of . The community&#x27;s ethnic composition was 5,302 (96.29%) Native American, 39 (0.71%) White, 2 (0.04%) belonging to other racial groups, and 1.1% multiracial. Additionally, 1.8% of the population identified as Hispanic. The demographic profile shows over 40% of the population being under 18 years of age.

===Economic and health metrics===
The Red Lake Reservation has the lowest per capita income among all reservations in the state, recorded at US$8,372 in 1999 according to the Northwest Area Foundation. Around 40% of the community lives beneath the poverty line. The period between 1990 and 2000 saw a 40% population increase as individuals returned to the reservation, driven by employment challenges elsewhere during economic recessions.

The reservation faces a near 60% unemployment rate, closely linked to prevalent poverty, which is believed to exacerbate the crime rate. In 2004, tribal police reported 3,500 court cases.

This high unemployment and poverty level have led to significant issues, including elevated violence rates and suicide. A 2004 study by Minnesota School revealed alarming statistics: 43% of freshman boys and 81% of freshman girls had contemplated suicide, with 48% of the girls having attempted it. Furthermore, the high school faces challenges in maintaining graduation rates.

==Geography==
Red Lake Reservation has some widely scattered properties in northwest Minnesota. Most of the Reservation is located around Lower and Upper Red Lake, which is one of the largest lakes in the United States. The land area of the Reservation is located mainly around Lower Red Lake and west of that and Upper Red Lake. The land is covered by prime forest.

According to the United States Census Bureau in 2020, the reservation has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Elevation across the Red Lake Reservation ranges in elevation from 1,100 feet above sea level to 1,300 feet above sea level. Besides Lower and Upper Red Lakes, many smaller lakes are scattered across the reservation, especially south of Lower Red Lake.

===Communities===
Communities on the Red Lake Reservation:

*Little Rock
*Ponemah
*Red Lake
*Redby

===Climate===
Red Lake Reservation has extreme climate conditions. Winters are long and cold, while summers are short and warm. During the winter months of December, January, and February, the average low temperatures at Red Lake are 0, -8, and -3 °F. Average high temperatures for the same winter months at Red Lake are 19, 13, and 20 °F. Average high temperatures for the summer months of June, July, and August at Red Lake are 73, 78, and 76 °F. Average low temperatures for the same summer months at Red Lake are 51, 57, and 54 °F.

The lake and forest contribute to significant precipitation at Red Lake, annually. The large lake has a warming effect, especially in low temperatures. The mild summer low temperatures are a result of the warming effect of Lower and Upper Red Lake. Low temperatures during the summer further south, are cooler, especially at communities that are not located next to lakes.

==Economy==
The tribe operates three casinos: Seven Clans Casino Red Lake in Red Lake, 
Seven Clans Casino Thief River Falls near Thief River Falls, and Seven Clans Casino Warroad (formerly called the Lake of the Woods Bingo and Casino) in Warroad. The three casinos combined are known as Seven Clans Casinos.

Industry on the reservation has consisted primarily of sustainable logging and commercial fishing of walleye in the lakes. 

The Red Lake Nation Department of Natural Resources has been instrumental in reviving walleye populations. Walleye production dropped significantly in the 1990s, adding to the reservation&#x27;s financial problems; a joint effort by Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Red Lake Band to create a sustainable walleye fishery resulted in a seven-year closure of Red Lake to harvest that ended in 2006 and was followed by stricter regulation. The tribe operates the Akina Red Lake Fishery, a fish-packing plant in Redby, Minnesota.

Northern Minnesota tribes are working together to stimulate economic development in the region. The Red Lake, Leech Lake, and White Earth nations created the Northern Minnesota Tribal Economic Development Commission. They are seeking to make more connections with area businesses and resources. In 2008 the three tribes organized the Northern Minnesota Reservation Economic Development Summit and Trade Show. The White Earth Band is the largest of the six who belong to the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, to which the Leech Lake Band also belongs.

An economic project with health and cultural benefits, in 2018 the Red Lake Band introduced a bison herd to the reservation with guidance from Kade Ferris (Turtle Mountain Chippewa/Métis), the Red Lake Band&#x27;s tribal archaeologist. The herd provides meat to tribal citizens, and it and the nearby garden are part of the Red Lake Nation&#x27;s Food Initiative.

==Government==
In 1934, Red Lake rejected organization under the Indian Reorganization Act, as it preferred to retain a clan-based system of governance. The Band did not join the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, a federally recognized conglomeration of Minnesota&#x27;s other Chippewa nations, which has its own governing authority.

During the 1950s, governmental reform efforts in Red Lake resulted in the drafting of a tribal constitution. The constitution established an elected Tribal Council; a group of seven traditionally selected tribal leaders was established to serve on an advisory basis. Together with the elected council members, these traditional leaders form the Tribal Council&#x27;s subordinate committees.

In 1959, Roger Jourdain was elected as Red Lake&#x27;s first chairman; he was successively re-elected until 1990. Jourdain is credited with working to affirm the tribe&#x27;s sovereignty through negotiations with the state and federal governments, which resulted in Red Lake&#x27;s continued exemption from Public Law 280.

Jourdain&#x27;s administration also oversaw the reopening of an Indian Health Service hospital and extensive infrastructure improvements, which focused on running water, housing development, and roads. Jourdain&#x27;s administration also attracted controversy; in 1979, a two-day riot occurred on the reservation following the Tribal Council&#x27;s dismissal of its secretary-treasurer. During the riots, armed protestors attacked the tribal police station and burned fourteen buildings, including Jourdain&#x27;s home. Two teenagers were killed; one during a struggle over a weapon and the other due to an accidental, self-inflicted wound.

In 1990, Gerald &quot;Butch&quot; Brun unseated Jourdain. Darrell G. Seki Sr. is the current tribal chairman as of 2022.

Between 2015 and 2020, the Red Lake Nation participated in the Tiwahe Demonstration Project, a pilot for a federal program that provides funding for tribal governments to enhance their self-governance and integrate public services. Red Lake Nation used this funding in part to hire a Healing to Wellness Court (HTWC) judge and to improve its family drug courts, which seek to provide alternatives to incarceration and reduce recidivism.

In 2021, the Red Lake Nation received authorization from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to exercise authority over the water quality standards for its tribal surface water.

School systems include:
*Red Lake School District
**Red Lake Senior High School
*Endazhi-Nitaawiging Charter School

<text>Sir Peter John Davis (born 23 December 1941) is a British businessman, who was, from 2000 to 2004, the CEO of J Sainsbury plc, which operates the UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s.

Davis was born in Cheshire on 23 December 1941, the son of John Stephen Davis and Adriaantje de Baat. He was educated at Shrewsbury School. Peter Davis worked for a company called the Ditchburn Organisation, Dock Road, Lytham, Lancashire, U.K. circa 1960/61.

Ditchburns had two sides, one side being Ditchburn Music Maker, which manufactured and sold Juke Boxes and the other side being Ditchburn Vending Machines, which manufactured and sold Hot and Cold drink vending machines. Davis worked for the sales and marketing side of Ditchburn Vending Machines.

Davis worked for Sainsbury from 1976 to 1986 as marketing director and then assistant managing director. Between 1986 and 1994 he was chief executive and chairman of the publishing business Reed International and was involved in the merger with the Dutch scientific publisher Elsevier.

He was chief executive of Prudential plc from 1995 having joined the company as a non-executive director. During this period, the company was condemned by the Treasury for mis-selling more pensions than any other firm. The Securities and Investments Board ordered the firm to retrain its entire sales staff, due to &#x27;continuing and persistent breaches&#x27; of the standards of training for the sales force.

Davis was knighted in the 1997 New Year Honours for services to training and to industry. In 1997 he featured in the Prudential&#x27;s television advertising campaign &#x27;The Man from the Pru&#x27;, built around the image of Davis as a friendly man advising on his customers&#x27; futures. In reality, Prudential staff were required to call him &#x27;Mr Davis&#x27; when they met him.

Davis rejoined Sainsbury&#x27;s on 1 March 2000 as chief executive officer and implemented a £2bn investment in upgrading IT systems, distribution depots and stores. During his term Sainsbury&#x27;s was demoted to third in the UK grocery market, behind Tesco and Asda. However, in his first two years he raised profits above target and delivered significant cost savings.

With the arrival of Justin King as CEO on 29 March 2004, Davis was promoted to chairman. He was due to step down in July 2005 (the appointment of Sir Ian Prosser, ex-Bass chairman, as his successor was aborted in February 2004), but in June 2004 he was forced to quit in the face of an impending shareholder revolt over his salary and bonuses. Investors were angered by a bonus share award of £2.4m in the face of the supermarket&#x27;s drop in market share. Davis was succeeded by Philip Hampton.

Davis has also served on the board of Boots. He was previously on the board of Business in the Community (1991–2005), having been chairman from 1996 to December 2001 and served two terms on the Board of the Royal Opera House and was Trustee and Chairman of the Royal Opera House Foundation.

Davis is a senior advisor and a member of the advisory board of Permira, Europe&#x27;s largest private equity company. He has served as a Trustee of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers. Between 2006 and 2011 he was chairman of the charity Marie Curie Cancer Care.

<text>Robertus Henricus &quot;Robbert&quot; Dijkgraaf, (; born 24 January 1960) is a Dutch theoretical physicist, mathematician and string theorist and former politician. He served as the Minister of Education, Culture and Science in the Netherlands from 2022 until 2024. From July 2012 until his inauguration as a minister, he had been the director and Leon Levy professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and a tenured professor at the University of Amsterdam.

==Early life and education==
Robertus Henricus Dijkgraaf was born on 24 January 1960 in Ridderkerk, Netherlands. Dijkgraaf attended the Erasmiaans Gymnasium in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

He started his education in physics at Utrecht University in 1978. After completing his candidate&#x27;s degree (equivalent to BSc degree) in 1982, he briefly turned away from physics to pursue a painting education at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie. In 1984, he returned to Utrecht University and obtained an MSc degree in theoretical physics in 1986. He then went on to performing doctoral research under supervision of future Nobel laureate Gerard &#x27;t Hooft. He studied together with the twins Erik and Herman Verlinde. The original arrangement was that only one of the trio would work on string theory, but all three ended up writing their thesis on this subject. Dijkgraaf obtained his PhD degree &quot;cum laude&quot; in 1989. His thesis was titled &quot;A Geometrical Approach to Two Dimensional Conformal Field Theory&quot;.

For a few years he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study, working alongside Edward Witten.

== Work ==
In 1992, he was appointed professor of mathematical physics at the University of Amsterdam, a chair he held until 2004, when he was appointed distinguished professor at the same university.

From 2008 to 2012 he was president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected as one of the two co-chairs of the InterAcademy Council for the period 2009 to 2013.

Starting in 2012, Dijkgraaf became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study, an independent academic institution located in the town of Princeton, New Jersey. On that date, he stepped down from his position as president of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He has served on numerous boards including at the Teylers Museum and the NEMO Science Museum.

He regularly appears on Dutch television and has a monthly column in the Dutch newspaper &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot;.

==Political career==
Starting on 10 January 2022, Dijkgraaf served as the Minister of Education in the Dutch government. He introduced the Balanced Internationalisation Act in the House of Representatives in 2024. This bill would allow colleges and universities to limit the number of foreign students they accept, and it would enforce stricter regulations on using the Dutch language in academic studies. Dijkgraaf&#x27;s term as minister ended on 2 July 2024, when the Schoof cabinet was sworn in.

==Other activities==
* Simons Foundation, Member of the Board of Directors (since 2021)
* Scholars at Risk (SAR), Member of the Ambassadors Council

==Awards and honours==
In 1998 Dijkgraaf was an Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

In 2003, Dijkgraaf was awarded the Spinoza Prize. In doing so he became the first recipient of the award whose advisor also was a recipient (Gerard &#x27;t Hooft received the first Spinoza Prize in 1995). He used part of his Spinoza Prize grant to set up a website targeted at children and promoting science: Proefjes.nl.

Dijkgraaf is an elected Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2003 and of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities.

On 30 May 2012, he was elected an Honorary Member of both the Royal Netherlands Chemical Society and the Netherlands&#x27; Physical Society. On 5 June 2012, Dijkgraaf was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion. In 2012, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

He was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (HonFRSE) in the disciplines of informatics, mathematics and statistics in 2013. That same year, he was elected as Member of the American Philosophical Society.

He received honorary doctorates from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Leiden University in 2019. In 2019, Dijkgraaf was awarded the inaugural Iris Medal for Excellent Science Communication, presented at the Evening of Science &amp; Society in the Ridderzaal in The Hague, by Ingrid van Engelshoven, Minister of Education, Culture, and Science, in the presence of King Willem-Alexander.

==Research==
Dijkgraaf&#x27;s research focuses on string theory and the interface of mathematics and physics in general. He is best known for his work on topological string theory and matrix models, and his name has been given to the Dijkgraaf-Witten invariants and the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde formula.

==Personal life==
Dijkgraaf is married to the author and has three children. Their daughter Charlotte was born with a rare type of Leukemia and was the subject of book written by her mother Pia de Jong, &quot;Saving Charlotte: A Mother and the Power of Intuition&quot;.

==Electoral history==

<text>Erik Peter Verlinde (; born 21 January 1962) is a Dutch theoretical physicist and string theorist. He is the identical twin brother of physicist Herman Verlinde. The Verlinde formula, which is important in conformal field theory and topological field theory, is named after him. His research deals with string theory, gravity, black holes and cosmology. Currently, he works at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam.

At a symposium at the Dutch Spinoza-institute on December 8, 2009 he introduced a theory of entropic gravity. In this theory, gravity exists because of a difference in concentration of information in the empty space between two masses and its surroundings; he also extrapolates this to general relativity and quantum mechanics. He said in an interview with the newspaper &quot;de Volkskrant&quot;, &quot;On the smallest level Newton&#x27;s laws don&#x27;t apply, but they do for apples and planets. You can compare this to the pressure of a gas. Molecules themselves don&#x27;t have any pressure, but a barrel of gas has.&quot; It appears that Verlinde&#x27;s approach to explaining gravity leads naturally to the correct observed strength of dark energy.

==Biography==
Erik Verlinde was born in the Dutch village of Woudenberg on 21 January 1962, together with his identical twin brother, Herman Verlinde. He went to school in the nearby city of Utrecht, where he graduated from the gymnasium in 1980.

That fall he began his studies in theoretical physics together with his brother at Utrecht University. There he studied with his brother Herman, Robbert Dijkgraaf, and Kareljan Schoutens. He wrote his Master&#x27;s thesis with Nobel laureate Gerard &#x27;t Hooft.

In 1985, Verlinde started work on his PhD at Utrecht University under the formal supervision of Bernard de Wit. He worked again with Herman and Dijkgraaf, and in practice the trio supervised themselves. The original arrangement was that only one of them would be working on the emerging field of string theory, but in the end all three of them wrote their theses on the subject. In September 1988 Erik defended his PhD thesis, which included the Verlinde formula.

After his PhD, Verlinde joined the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton as a postdoctoral fellow. In 1993, he was added to the permanent staff of the theory division of CERN in Geneva. At the age of 34 he was appointed full professor of theoretical physics at Utrecht University. Only a few years later, in 1999, he left for Princeton University to take up a professorial position there. In 2003, he returned to the Netherlands to become a professor in the string theory group led by Robbert Dijkgraaf at the University of Amsterdam.

==Major contributions==
Verlinde&#x27;s main field of research is string theory. Over the years he has introduced a number of results that have become important in the development of the theory, and in the study of pure mathematics.

===Verlinde formula===

Verlinde&#x27;s PhD thesis was titled “Conformal Field Theory Applied to Strings”. In it he investigated conformal field theories in two dimensions and their relation to the description of the world sheet of fundamental strings. As part of the project he extended fusion or Verlinde algebras, describing conformal field theories with a finite number of fields. A main result was an explicit formula for the fusion rules of these algebras, now known as the Verlinde formula. This has proven to be a highly non-trivial mathematical result. In Verlinde&#x27;s original work, the formula followed from mainly physical arguments, but since its introduction many formal mathematical proofs have been provided.

=== Cardy formula extensions ===

The Cardy formula is an important result in conformal field theory that allows the calculation of the entropy of a 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory. Using the AdS/CFT correspondence between conformal field theories and quantum gravity in anti-de Sitter spaces with one additional dimension, it can be used to calculate (the quantum corrections to) the entropy of black holes in 2+1 dimensions. In 2000, Verlinde extended Cardy&#x27;s result to conformal field theories of arbitrary dimension,
allowing the calculation of entropy of black holes in any dimension.

===Entropic gravity===

In 2009, Verlinde showed that the laws of gravity may be derived by assuming a form of the holographic principle and the laws of thermodynamics. This may imply that gravity is not a true fundamental force of nature (like e.g. electromagnetism), but instead is a consequence of the universe striving to maximize entropy.

===Emergent gravity and the dark universe===
On 8 November 2016 Erik Verlinde published his new theory of gravity, where gravity is not one of the four fundamental forces of physics but, rather, gravity is emergent from other fundamental forces. In this work, he argues that unlike in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, holography and the area law do not apply exactly in de Sitter space (which models our universe) because there is an additional entropy associated with the cosmological horizon. If this entropy were evenly distributed throughout space, it would contribute a volume law term to the entropy which becomes dominant at large length scales and is related to dark energy. He further argues that this entropy modifies emergent gravity, introducing residual forces when the acceleration due to gravity is very weak. The result provides a candidate explanation for dark matter similar to the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) proposal and explains the empirical relationship between dark matter and the Hubble constant. By Aug 1st 2018 the paper has been quoted in 153 physics papers, including by well-known physicists such as Lee Smolin, and Mordehai Milgrom - originator of MOND. Explanation of modified gravity through entropic gravity is a &quot;quantum gravity theory&quot; merging &quot;general theory of relativity&quot; with &quot;quantum field theory&quot;. Verlinde himself names it also quantum information theory. 

There are already critical papers on &quot;emergent gravity&quot; such as &quot;Inconsistencies in Verlinde’s emergent gravity&quot; by D Dai, D Stojkovic (Springer HEP, Nov 2017), stating that &quot;...When properly done, Verlinde’s
elaborate procedure recovers the standard Newtonian gravity instead of MOND&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
In June 2011, the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) awarded Verlinde the Spinoza Prize, the highest award available to Dutch scientists including a 2.5 million euro grant for future research. The committee cited his work on the Verlinde formula, the Witten–Dijkgraaf–Verlinde–Verlinde equations, the Cardy-Verlinde formula and entropic gravity as the major achievements leading to the award.

In 1760, he became an external member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, Privy Councillor in the newly founded Office for Public Works, Section of Mechanical Engineering and Hydraulic Engineering. In 1780 Silberschlag observed and described the Brocken bow (also called Brocken spectre). In his book &quot;Geonetics&quot; or Explanation of the Mosaic Creation according to Physical and Mathematical Foundations (&quot;Geogonie oder Erklärung der mosaischen Erderschaffung nach physikalischen und mathematischen Grundlagen&quot;) he tried to reconcile theology and science. 

The lunar crater Silberschlag is named after him.

<text>A Brocken spectre (British English; American spelling: Brocken specter; ), also called Brocken bow, mountain spectre, or spectre of the Brocken is the magnified (and apparently enormous) shadow of an observer cast in mid air upon any type of cloud opposite a strong light source. The figure&#x27;s head can be surrounded by a bright area called , or halo-like rings of rainbow-coloured light forming a glory, which appear opposite the Sun&#x27;s direction when uniformly sized water droplets in clouds refract and backscatter sunlight.

The phenomenon can appear on any misty mountainside, cloud bank, or be seen from an aircraft, but the frequent fogs and low-altitude accessibility of the Brocken, the highest peak of the Harz Mountains in Germany, have created a local legend from which the phenomenon draws its name. The Brocken spectre was observed and described by Johann Silberschlag in 1780, and has often been recorded in literature about the region.

== Occurrence ==
The &quot;spectre&quot; appears when the sun shines from behind the observer, who is looking down from a ridge or peak into mist or fog.
The light projects the observer&#x27;s shadow through the mist, often in a triangular shape due to perspective.
The apparent magnification of size of the shadow is an optical illusion that occurs when the observer judges their shadow on relatively nearby clouds to be at the same distance as faraway land objects seen through gaps in the clouds, or when there are no reference points by which to judge its size. The shadow also falls on water droplets of varying distances from the eye, confusing depth perception. The ghost can appear to move (sometimes suddenly) because of the movement of the cloud layer and variations in density within the cloud.

== Ulloa&#x27;s halo ==
Before the first reports of the phenomenon in Europe, two members of the French Geodesic Mission to the Equator, Antonio de Ulloa and Pierre Bouguer, reported that while walking near the summit of the Pambamarca mountain, in the Ecuadorian Andes, they saw their shadows projected on a lower-lying cloud, with a circular &quot;halo or glory&quot; around the shadow of the observer&#x27;s head. Ulloa noted that

This was then called &quot;Ulloa&#x27;s halo&quot; or &quot;Bouguer&#x27;s halo&quot;. Ulloa reported that the glories were surrounded by a larger ring of white light, which would today be called a fog bow. On other occasions, he observed arches of white light formed by reflected moonlight, whose explanation is unknown but which may have been related to ice-crystal halos.

== References in popular culture and the arts ==

Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s poem &quot;Constancy to an Ideal Object&quot; concludes with an image of the Brocken spectre:
&lt;poem&gt;
And art thou nothing? Such thou art, as when
The woodman winding westward up the glen
At wintry dawn, where o&#x27;er the sheep-track&#x27;s maze
The viewless snow-mist weaves a glist&#x27;ning haze,
Sees full before him, gliding without tread,
An image with a glory round its head;
The enamoured rustic worships its fair hues,
Nor knows he makes the shadow he pursues!&lt;/poem&gt;

Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; includes a line about a Spectre who &quot;...tried the Brocken business first/but caught a sort of chill/so came to England to be nursed/and here it took the form of thirst/which he complains of still.&quot;

Stanisław Lem&#x27;s &quot;Fiasco&quot; (1986) has a reference to the &quot;Brocken Specter&quot;: &quot;He was alone. He had been chasing himself. Not a common phenomenon, but known even on Earth. The Brocken Specter in the Alps, for example.&quot; The situation, of pursuing one&#x27;s self, via a natural illusion is a repeated theme in Lem. A scene of significance in his book &quot;The Investigation&quot; (1975) depicts a detective who, within the confines of a snowy, dead-end alley, confronts a man who turns out to be the detective&#x27;s own reflection, &quot;The stranger... was himself. He was standing in front of a huge mirrored wall marking the end of the arcade.&quot;

In &quot;The Radiant Warrior&quot; (1989), part of Leo Frankowski&#x27;s Conrad Stargard series, the protagonist uses the Brocken Spectre to instill confidence in his recruits.

The Brocken spectre is a key trope in Paul Beatty&#x27;s &quot;The White Boy Shuffle&quot; (1996), in which a character, Nicholas Scoby, declares that his dream (he specifically calls it a &quot;Dream and a half, really&quot;) is to see his glory through a Brocken spectre (69).

In James Hogg&#x27;s novel &quot;The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner&quot; (1824) the Brocken spectre is used to suggest psychological horror.

Carl Jung in &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot; wrote:

... I had a dream which both frightened and encouraged me. It was night in some unknown place, and I was making slow and painful headway against a mighty wind. Dense fog was flying along everywhere. I had my hands cupped around a tiny light which threatened to go out at any moment... Suddenly I had the feeling that something was coming up behind me. I looked back, and saw a gigantic black figure following me... When I awoke I realized at once that the figure was a &quot;specter of the Brocken,&quot; my own shadow on the swirling mists, brought into being by the little light I was carrying.

In &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Geli Tripping and Slothrop make &quot;god-shadows&quot; from a Harz precipice, as Walpurgisnacht wanes to dawn. Additionally, the French–Canadian quadruple agent Rémy Marathe muses episodically about the possibility of witnessing the fabled spectre on the mountains of Tucson in David Foster Wallace&#x27;s novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;.

The explorer Eric Shipton saw a Brocken Spectre during his first ascent of Nelion on Mount Kenya with Percy Wyn-Harris and Gustav Sommerfelt in 1929. He wrote:
Then the towering buttresses of Batian and Nelion appeared; the rays of the setting sun broke through and, in the east, sharply defined, a great circle of rainbow colours framed our own silhouettes. It was the only perfect Brocken Spectre I have ever seen.

The progressive metal band Fates Warning makes numerous references to the Brocken Spectre in both their debut album title &quot;Night on Bröcken&quot; and in lyrics on a subsequent song called &quot;The Sorceress&quot; from the album &quot;Awaken the Guardian&quot; that read &quot;Through the Brocken Spectre rose a luring Angel.&quot;

The design of Kriemhild Gretchen, a Witch in the anime series &quot;Puella Magi Madoka Magica&quot;, may have been inspired by the Brocken spectre.

In Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;, Book II Chapter 23, Flora Finching, in the course of one of her typically free-associative babbles to Mr Clennam, says &quot; ... ere yet Mr F appeared a misty shadow on the horizon paying attentions like the well-known spectre of some place in Germany beginning with a B ... &quot;

&quot;Brocken Spectre&quot; is the title of a track on David Tipper&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Broken Soul Jamboree&quot;.

In the tokusatsu series &quot;Tensou Sentai Goseiger&quot;, Semattarei of the Brocken Spectre is one of the enemies that Gosei Angels must face.

In the manga &quot;One Piece&quot;, Brocken spectres make an appearance in the Skypiea story arc.

In the anime &quot;Detective Conan&quot;, Brocken spectres are mentioned in episode 348 and episode 546 as well.

In &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot; by C.S. Lewis the Brocken spectre is mentioned in the chapter &quot;Heaven&quot;.

In chapter 12 of &quot;Whose Body?&quot; (Lord Peter Wimsey) by Dorothy L. Sayers.

The Brocken Spectre occurring is proven by lawyers to explain circumstances in a case in episode 9 of &quot;Innocence, Fight Against False Charges&quot;, a 2019 Japanese drama.

In October 2024 the BBC News website reported that a wildlife photographer from East Yorkshire in the United Kingdom captured a photo of a Brocken Spectre whilst out bird watching in Bridlington.

<text>Sulci or Sulki (in Greek , Steph. B., Ptol.; , Strabo; , Paus.), was one of the most considerable cities of ancient Sardinia, situated in the southwest corner of the island, on a small island, now called Isola di Sant&#x27;Antioco, which is, however, joined to the mainland by a narrow isthmus or neck of sand. South of this isthmus, between the island and the mainland, is an extensive bay, now called the Golfo di Palmas, which was known in ancient times as the &quot;Sulcitanus Portus&quot; (Ptol.).

==Origins==

The foundation of Sulci (Punic:) is expressly attributed to the Carthaginians (Paus. x. 17. § 9; Claudian, &quot;B. Gild.&quot; 518), and it seems to have become under that people one of the most considerable cities of Sardinia, and one of the chief seats of their power in the island. However, as noted by archaeologists the city was founded by Tyrians during the late 9th century BCE, and most of the inhabitants were probably native Sardinians, it remained independent until Carthage conquered it in the late 6th century BCE Its name was first mentioned in history during the First Punic War, when the Carthaginian general, Hannibal Gisco, having been defeated in a sea-fight (the Battle of Sulci, 258 BCE) by Gaius Sulpicius Paterculus, took refuge at Sulci, but was slain in a tumult by his own soldiers (Zonaras viii. 12).

==Caesar&#x27;s civil war==

No other mention of the name occurs in history until the civil war between Pompey and Caesar. The citizens of Sulci received in their port the fleet of Nasidius, the admiral of Pompey, and furnished Pompey with supplies; for which service they were severely punished by Caesar, on his return from Africa, 46 BCE. Caesar imposed on the city a contribution of 100,000 sesterces, besides heavily increasing its annual tribute of corn (Hirt. &quot;B. Aft.&quot; 98). Notwithstanding this infliction, Sulci seems to have continued under the Roman Empire to be one of the most flourishing towns in the island. Strabo and Mela both mention it as if it were the second city in Sardinia; and its municipal rank is attested by inscriptions, as well as by Pliny. (Strab. v. p. 225; Mel. ii. 7. § 19; Plin. iii. 7. s. 13; Ptol. iii. 3. § 3; Inset. &quot;ap&quot; De la Marmora, vol. ii. pp. 479, 482.) The Itineraries give a line of road proceeding from Tibula (at the extreme north of Sardinia) direct to Sulci, a sufficient proof of the importance of the latter place. (Itin. Ant. pp. 83, 84.) It was also one of the four chief episcopal sees into which Sardinia was divided, and seems to have continued to be inhabited through a great part of the Middle Ages, but ceased to exist before the 13th century.

==Present day==

The remains of the ancient city are distinctly seen a little to the north of the modern town of Sant&#x27;Antioco, on the island or peninsula of the same name: and the works of art which have been found there bear testimony to its flourishing condition under the Romans. (De la Marmora, vol. ii. p. 357; Smyth&#x27;s &quot;Sardinia&quot;, p. 317.) The name of Sulcis is given at the present day to the whole district of the mainland, immediately opposite to Sant&#x27;Antioco, which is one of the most fertile and best cultivated tracts in the whole of Sardinia. The Sulcitani of Ptolemy (iii. 3. § 6) are evidently the inhabitants of this district.

The Itineraries mention a town or village of the name of Sulci on the E. coast of Sardinia, which must not be confounded with the more celebrated city of the name. (Itin. Ant. p. 80.) It was probably situated at Girasole (De la Marmora, p. 443) or Tortolì.

<text>&lt;onlyinclude&gt;
Community psychology is concerned with the community as the unit of study. This contrasts with most psychology, which focuses on the individual. Community psychology also studies the community as a context for the individuals within it, and the relationships of the individual to communities and society. Community psychologists seek to understand the functioning of the community, including the quality of life of persons within groups, organizations and institutions, communities, and society. They aim to enhance the quality of life through collaborative research and action.

Community psychology employs various perspectives within and outside psychology to address issues of communities, the relationships within them, and related people&#x27;s attitudes and behaviour.

Julian Rappaport discusses the perspective of community psychology as an ecological perspective on the person-environment fit (this is often related to work environments) being the focus of study and action instead of attempting to change the personality of an individual or the environment when an individual is seen as having a problem.

Closely related disciplines include community practice, ecological psychology, environmental psychology, critical psychology, cross-cultural psychology, social psychology, political science, public health, sociology, social work, applied anthropology, and community development.

In the United States, community psychology grew out of the community mental health movement, but evolved dramatically as early practitioners incorporated their understandings of political structures and other community contexts into perspectives on client services. However, in other regions, it has had different origins. In much of Latin America, for example, it developed from social psychology as a response to the &quot;crisis of social psychology&quot; and the search for psychological theory and practice relevant to the social problems of the region. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Society for Community Research and Action ==
Division 27 of the American Psychological Association is the community psychology division of the APA, called the Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA). The Society&#x27;s mission is as follows:
The SCRA website has resources for teaching and learning community psychology, information on events in the field and related to research and action, how to become involved and additional information on the field, members and undergraduate and graduate programs in community psychology.

==History of community psychology in the US==
In the 1950s and 1960s, many factors contributed to the beginning of community psychology in the US. Some of these factors include:
* A shift away from socially conservative, individual-focused practices in health care and psychology into a progressive period concerned with issues of public health, prevention and social change after World War II and social psychologists&#x27; growing interest in racial and religious prejudice, poverty, and other social issues 
* The perceived need of larger-scale mental illness treatment for veterans
* Psychologists questioning the value of psychotherapy alone in treating large numbers of people with mental illness
* The development of community mental health centers and de-institutionalization of people with mental illnesses into their communities

===Swampscott Conference===
In 1965, several psychologists met to discuss the future of community mental health as well as discuss the issue of only being involved with problems of mental health instead of the community as a whole. The Swampscott Conference is considered the birthplace of community psychology. A published report on the conference proposed that the role of the community psychologist &#x27;may ... be seen as that of a &quot;participant-conceptualizer.&quot; In 1987, the American Journal of Community Psychology published a special issue to commemorate the creation of the discipline.

==Theories, concepts and values in community psychology==

===Ecological levels of analysis===
James Kelly (1966; Trickett, 1984) developed an ecological analogy used to understand the ways in which settings and individuals are interrelated. Unlike the ecological framework developed by Bronfenbrenner (1979), the focus of Kelly&#x27;s framework was not so much on how different levels of the environment may impact on the individual, but on understanding how human communities function. Specifically, Kelly suggests that there are 4 important principles that govern people in settings: 
* &quot;adaptation&quot;: i.e. that what individuals do is adaptive given the demands of the surrounding context. It is a two-way process: Individuals adapt to the restrictions, constraints, and quality of the environment, while the environment adapts to its members 
**Examples: In regards to adaption of the individual, take for instance when an individual adapts to the demands of a new job, they adapt to that environment by learning or acquiring any necessary skills that they may need to perform their tasks well. On the environmental side of adaption, we can imagine various situations involving the family, such as the birth of a child, new job of a parent, or when children attend college and move away from home; in all of these instances the environment adapted as necessary to the changes in its members 
* &quot;succession&quot;: every setting has a history that created current structures, norms, attitudes, and policies, and any intervention in the setting must appreciate this history and understand why the current system exists in the form that it does. This principle applies to families, organizations, and communities; further, an implication of noting and understanding succession in these units is that psychologists must understand the history of that unit (family, organization, or community) before attempting to implement an intervention plan 
* &quot;cycling of resources&quot;: each setting has resources that need to be identified and possibilities for new resources to be developed; a resource perspective emphasizes a focus on strengths of individuals, groups, and institutions within the setting and interventions are more likely to succeed if they build on such existing strengths, rather than introduce new external mechanisms for change. There are &quot;personal resources&quot; which include individual talents, strengths, or specialties, as well as &quot;social resources&quot; such as shared norms, beliefs, or values; further, aspects of the physical environment can be considered resources, such as calm resting places, a library, and other qualities of the space in particular 
* &quot;interdependence&quot;: settings are systems, and any change to one aspect of the setting will have consequences for other aspects of the setting, so any intervention needs to anticipate its impact across the entire setting, and be prepared for unintended consequences. When we look at a school, for instance, as a real-world example, the interdependent parts include: students, teachers, administrators, students&#x27; parents, faculty and staff (secretaries, janitors, counselors, nurses), board members, and taxpayers 

===First-order and second-order change===

Because community psychologists often work on social issues, they are often working toward positive social change. Watzlawick, et al. (1974) differentiated between first-order and second-order change and how second-order change is often the focus of community psychology.
* &quot;first-order change&quot;: positively changing the individuals in a setting to attempt to fix a problem
* &quot;second-order change&quot;: Attending to systems and structures involved with the problem to adjust the person–environment fit

As an example of how these methods differ, consider homelessness. A first-order change to &quot;fix&quot; homelessness would be to offer shelter to one or many homeless people. A second-order change would be to address issues in policy regarding affordable housing.

===Prevention and health promotion===
Community psychology emphasizes principles and strategies of preventing social, emotional and behavioral problems and wellness and health promotion at the individual and community levels, borrowed from Public health and Preventive medicine, rather than a passive, &quot;waiting-mode,&quot; treatment-based medical model. Universal, selective, primary, and indicated or secondary prevention (early identification and intervention) are particularly emphasized. Community psychology&#x27;s contributions to prevention science have been substantial, including development and evaluation of the Head Start Program.

===Empowerment===
One of the goals of community psychology involves empowerment of individuals and communities that have been marginalized by society.

One definition for the term is &quot;an intentional, ongoing process centered in the local community, involving mutual respect, critical reflection, caring, and group participation, through which people lacking an equal share of resources gain greater access to and control over those resources&quot; (Cornell Empowerment Group).

Rappaport&#x27;s (1984) definition includes: &quot;Empowerment is viewed as a process: the mechanism by which people, organizations, and communities gain mastery over their lives.&quot;

While empowerment has had an important place in community psychology research and literature, some have criticized its use. Riger (1993), for example, points to the paradoxical nature of empowerment being a masculine, individualistic construct being used in community research. Community psychologist Guy Holmes critiqued empowerment as a vague concept replete with what Wolf Wolfensberger has called &#x27;high craze value&#x27; i.e. a fashionable term that means different things to different people, and ultimately means everything and nothing. Certainly few community psychologists would agree with Mao that &#x27;power grows out of the barrel of a gun.&#x27;

In the 1990s, the support and empowerment paradigm (Racino, 1992) was proposed as an organizing concept to replace or complement the prior rehabilitation paradigm, and to acknowledge the diverse groups and community-based work of the emerging community disciplines.

===Social justice===
A core value of community psychology is seeking social justice through research and action. Community psychologists are often advocates for equality and policies that allow for the wellbeing of all people, particularly marginalized populations. For example, in May 2019 in the City of Brighton and Hove - Unframed Lives was an event about homelessness and austerity.

===Diversity===
Another value of community psychology involves embracing diversity. Rappaport includes diversity as a defining aspect of the field, calling research to be done for the benefit of diverse populations in gaining equality and justice. This value is seen through much of the research done with communities regardless of ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability status, socioeconomic status, gender, and age.

===Individual wellness===
Individual wellness is the physical and psychological wellbeing of all people. Research in community psychology focuses on methods to increase individual wellness, particularly through prevention and second-order change.

===Citizen participation===
Citizen participation refers to the ability of individuals to have a voice in decision-making, defining and addressing problems, and the dissemination of information gathered on them. This is the basis for the usage of participatory action research in community psychology, where community members are often involved in the research process by sharing their unique knowledge and experience with the research team and working as co-researchers. In contrast, citizen participation is sought by community developers and community planners (i.e., public administrators) to assure that governmental funds best meet the needs of local citizenry. Three key values of participation are: building support for governmental planning, raising political consciousness, and furthering democratic values. Citizen participation in policymaking has a long history and has been particular strong in neighborhood action and poverty programs, and other activist-led initiatives.

===Collaboration and community strengths===
Collaboration with community members to construct research and action projects makes community psychology an exceptionally applied field. By allowing communities to use their knowledge to contribute to projects in a collaborative, fair and equal manner, the process of research can itself be empowering to citizens. This requires an ongoing relationship between the researcher and the community from before the research begins to after the research is over.

===Psychological sense of community===
Psychological sense of community (or simply &quot;sense of community&quot;), was introduced in 1974 by Seymour Sarason. In 1986 a major step was taken by David McMillan and David Chavis with the publication of their &quot;Theory of Sense of Community&quot; and in 1990 the &quot;Sense of Community Index&quot;. Originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, the Sense of Community Index (SCI) can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the workplace, schools, religious communities, communities of interest, etc.

===Empirical grounding===
Community psychology grounds all advocacy and social justice action in empiricism. This empirical grounding is what separates community psychology from a social movement or grassroots organization. Methods from psychology have been adapted for use in the field that acknowledge value-driven, subjective research involving community members. The methods used in community psychology are therefore tailored to each individual research question. Quantitative as well as qualitative methods and other innovative methods are embraced.

The American psychological Association has sponsored two major conferences on community research methods and has recently published an edited book on this topic.

== Comparison of community and clinical psychology in the UK ==
Community psychology has been differentiated from traditional clinical psychology as practiced in the UK in the following ways:

Examples of community psychology in the UK have been documented by Carolyn Kagan and Mark Burton, Jim Orford and Guy Holmes.

==Education==
Many programs related to community psychology are housed in psychology departments, while others are interdisciplinary. Students earning a community psychology degree complete courses that focus on: history and concepts of the field, human diversity and cultural competence, public health, community research methods and statistics, collaborative work in communities, organizational and community development and consultation, prevention and intervention, program evaluation, and grantwriting.

Research is a large component of both the PhD and master&#x27;s degrees, as community psychologists base interventions on theory and research and use action-oriented research to promote positive change. Further, students will generally find niches under faculty mentors at their institutions related to local programs, organizations, grants, special populations, or social issues of interest—granting students the chance to have practice doing the work of a community psychologist, under the supervision of a faculty member.

Many community psychologists will find clinical psychologists involved in their work in communities, and collaboration between academic departments are encouraged.

To disseminate the field and make community psychology education free, an online &quot;Introduction to Community Psychology&quot; textbook was published in June 2019.

<text>Loughor (; ) is a town in Swansea, Wales. Historically in Glamorgan, it lies on the estuary of the River Loughor (). The town has a community council under the name Llwchwr. The town is bordered by the communities of Bynea in Carmarthenshire, Grovesend, Gowerton, and Gorseinon. Loughor is part of the built-up area of Gorseinon.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name has been called &quot;possibly the oldest name in Gower&quot;, dating back to the Roman era. It derives from the name of the Roman fort of Leucarum.

==History==
The town includes the site of the Roman fort of Leucarum, occupied by Roman Auxiliary soldiers from AD73 to around 320. In 1106 much of South Wales was assigned to an Anglo-Norman lord, Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick, and as part of a castle-building programme he built Loughor Castle, as an earthwork with timber defenses, built into the south-east corner of the Roman ramparts. Over a turbulent 250 years or so the castle was progressively upgraded with stone buildings and curtain walls. The castle later fell into ruin and is now a scheduled monument in the care of Cadw. Meanwhile, Loughor developed around the castle. A medieval Church was established, also within the Roman fort. Rebuilt on the medieval foundations in 1885, St Michael&#x27;s Church was deconsecrated in 2021.

Loughor later grew as a port, although competition from the larger and better-connected ports at Llanelli and Burry Port, meant that Loughor was always a small-scale maritime town. Its position alongside the narrowing of the Loughor Estuary meant it was an important river crossing, originally as a ford at low tide and a ferry when the tide was in. A wooden swing-bridge was built in 1833, when river traffic still used the estuary. The arrival of the Railway in 1852 required the building of Loughor Viaduct, built from wooden trestles by Brunel, also originally featuring a swing-section. The viaduct was replaced by a steel and concrete structure in 2013. A new road bridge of 1923 acknowledged the river was now closed to shipping, and this itself was replaced by the new A484 Loughor bridge in 1988.

Loughor Estuary and Burry Inlet, with vast areas of sandbanks and some of the highest tidal ranges in the world, has always had its share of risks. The town has had its own lifeboat station since 1969, situated near the road bridge. The current lifeboat is a Ribcraft 5.85m RIB.

In the early 20th century the main industries were large tin and steel works, situated on both banks of the estuary. About 1800, John Vivian (1750–1826) of Truro, Cornwall, joined the Cheadle Brasswire Company as managing partner in the copper works at Loughor and Penclawdd. His family would go on to be key industrialists across the Swansea area, running copper-mining, copper-smelting and trading businesses, as Vivian &amp; Sons, throughout the 19th century. At Ysbytty, on the other side of the river, the Spitty copper works of the early 19th century was succeeded by a major iron and tin-plate works which continued into the 1950s. This employed large numbers of both men and women from Loughor, who would cross the estuary each day to get to work.

==Structure and amenities==

Loughor town can be divided into two areas, defined by the present electoral wards of Lower Loughor and Upper Loughor, which have separate histories. Lower Loughor lies nearer the sea on low ground, Upper Loughor on higher ground. Loughor initially developed around the Norman castle in what is now the Lower Loughor ward. Upper Loughor began as a distinct settlement, initially around what is now the Glebe Road area, and became established as a separate town by the mid-19th century. Loughor today is mostly a commuter town for Swansea and Llanelli via the Loughor bridge, and has merged with the neighbouring town of Gorseinon.

The West Wales line crosses the River Loughor over the Loughor Viaduct to the west of the town. Loughor railway station was closed in 1960.

Local schools in the town include Tre Uchaf Primary School and Casllwchwr Primary School. Opposite the Tre Uchaf Primary is one of the sites of Gower College Swansea.

The local rugby union team of the town is Loughor RFC. The Old Town Hall, built in 1868, is currently disused and boarded up.

==Notable people==
In birth order:
*Evan Roberts (1878–1951), minister, a major figure in the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival in religious worship
*James Henry Govier (1910–1974), painter, etcher and engraver of the Swansea School, produced several images of Loughor.
*Irma Chilton (1930–1990), children&#x27;s writer in English and Welsh

<text>Self-stabilization is a concept of fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Given any initial state, a self-stabilizing distributed system will end up in a correct state in a finite number of execution steps.

At first glance, the guarantee of self stabilization may seem less promising than that of the more traditional fault-tolerance of algorithms, that aim to guarantee that the system always remains in a correct state under certain kinds of state transitions. However, that traditional fault tolerance cannot always be achieved. For example, it cannot be achieved when the system is started in an incorrect state or is corrupted by an intruder. Moreover, because of their complexity, it is very hard to debug and to analyze distributed systems. Hence, it is very hard to prevent a distributed system from reaching an incorrect state. Indeed, some forms of self-stabilization are incorporated into many modern computer and telecommunications networks, since it gives them the ability to cope with faults that were not foreseen in the design of the algorithm.

Many years after the seminal paper of Edsger Dijkstra in 1974, this concept remains important as it presents an important foundation for self-managing computer systems and fault-tolerant systems. As a result, Dijkstra&#x27;s paper received the 2002 ACM PODC Influential-Paper Award, one of the highest recognitions in the distributed computing community.
Moreover, after Dijkstra&#x27;s death, the award was renamed and is now called the Dijkstra Award.

== History ==
E.W. Dijkstra in 1974 presented the concept of self-stabilization, prompting further research in this area. His demonstration involved the presentation of self-stabilizing mutual exclusion algorithms. It also showed the first self-stabilizing algorithms that did not rely on strong assumptions on the system. Some previous protocols used in practice did actually stabilize, but only assuming the existence of a clock that was global to the system, and assuming a known upper bound on the duration of each system transition. It was only ten years later when Leslie Lamport pointed out the importance of Dijkstra&#x27;s work at a 1983 conference called Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing that researchers directed their attention to this elegant fault-tolerance concept. In his talk, Lamport stated:I regard this as Dijkstra&#x27;s most brilliant work - at least, his most brilliant published paper. It&#x27;s almost completely unknown. I regard it to be a milestone in work on fault tolerance... I regard self-stabilization to be a very important concept in fault tolerance and to be a very fertile field for research.Afterwards, Dijkstra&#x27;s work was awarded ACM-PODC influential paper award, which then became ACM&#x27;s (the Association for computing Machinery) Dijkstra Prize in Distributed Computing given at the annual ACM-PODC symposium.

== Overview ==
A distributed algorithm is self-stabilizing if, starting from an arbitrary state, it is guaranteed to converge to a legitimate state and remain in a legitimate set of states thereafter. A state is legitimate if, starting from this state, the algorithm satisfies its specification. The property of self-stabilization enables a distributed algorithm to recover from a transient fault regardless of its nature. Moreover, a self-stabilizing algorithm does not have to be initialized as it eventually starts to behave correctly regardless of its initial state.

Dijkstra&#x27;s paper, which introduces the concept of self-stabilization, presents an example in the context of a &quot;token ring&quot;—a network of computers ordered in a circle. Here, each computer or processor can &quot;see&quot; the whole state of one processor that immediately precedes it and that this state may imply that the processor &quot;has a token&quot; or it &quot;does not have a token.&quot; One of the requirements is that exactly one of them must &quot;hold a token&quot; at any given time. The second requirement prescribes that each node &quot;passes the token&quot; to the computer/processor succeeding it so that the token eventually circulates the ring. 

* Not holding a token is a correct state for each computer in this network, since the token can be held by another computer. However, if every computer is in the state of &quot;not holding a token&quot; then the network altogether is not in a correct state.
* Similarly, if more than one computer &quot;holds a token&quot; then this is not a correct state for the network, although it cannot be observed to be incorrect by viewing any computer individually. Since every computer can &quot;observe&quot; only the states of its two neighbors, it is hard for the computers to decide whether the network altogether is in a correct state.

The first self-stabilizing algorithms did not detect errors explicitly in order to subsequently repair them. Instead, they constantly pushed the system towards a legitimate state. Since traditional methods for detecting an error were often very difficult and time-consuming, such a behavior was considered desirable.
(The method described in the paper cited above collects a huge amount of information from the whole network to one place; after that, it attempts to determine whether the collected global state is correct; even that determination alone can be a hard task).

=== Efficiency improvements ===
More recently, researchers have presented newer methods for light-weight error detection for self-stabilizing systems using local checking. and for general tasks.

The term &quot;local&quot; refers to a part of a computer network. When local detection is used, a computer in a network is not required to communicate with the entire network in order to detect an error—the error can be detected by having each computer communicate only with its nearest neighbors. These local detection methods simplified the task of designing self-stabilizing algorithms considerably. This is because the error detection mechanism and the recovery mechanism can be designed separately. Newer algorithms based on these detection methods also turned out to be much more efficient. Moreover, these papers suggested rather efficient general transformers to transform non self stabilizing algorithms to become self stabilizing. The idea is to,
# Run the non self stabilizing protocol, at the same time,
# detect faults (during the execution of the given protocol) using the above-mentioned detection methods,
# then, apply a (self stabilizing) &quot;reset&quot; protocol to return the system to some predetermined initial state, and, finally,
# restart the given (non- self stabilizing) protocol.
The combination of these 4 parts is self stabilizing (as long as there is no trigger of fault during the correction fault phases, e.g.,).
Initial self stabilizing protocols were also presented in the above papers. More efficient reset protocols were presented later, e.g.

Additional efficiency was introduced with the notion of time-adaptive protocols. The idea behind these is that when only a small number of errors occurs, the recovery time can (and should) be made short. Dijkstra&#x27;s original self-stabilization algorithms do not have this property.

A useful property of self-stabilizing algorithms is that they can be composed of layers if the layers do not exhibit any circular dependencies. The stabilization time of the composition is then bounded by the sum of the individual stabilization times of each layer.

New approaches to Dijkstra&#x27;s work emerged later on such as the case of Krzysztof Apt and Ehsan Shoja&#x27;s proposition, which demonstrated how self-stabilization can be naturally formulated using the standard concepts of strategic games, particularly the concept of an improvement path. This particular work sought to demonstrate the link between self-stabilization and game theory.

=== Time complexity ===
The time complexity of a self-stabilizing algorithm is measured in (asynchronous) rounds or cycles. 
* A &quot;round&quot; is the shortest execution trace in which each processor executes at least one step.
* Similarly, a &quot;cycle&quot; is the shortest execution trace in which each processor executes at least one complete iteration of its repeatedly executed list of commands.
To measure the output stabilization time, a subset of the state variables is defined to be externally visible (the &quot;output&quot;). Certain states of outputs are defined to be correct (legitimate). The set of the outputs of all the components of the system is said to have stabilized at the time that it starts to be correct, provided it stays correct indefinitely, unless additional faults occur. The output stabilization time is the time (the number of (asynchronous) &quot;rounds&quot;) until the output stabilizes.

== Definition ==
A system is self-stabilizing if and only if:
# Starting from any state, it is guaranteed that the system will eventually reach a correct state (&quot;convergence&quot;).
# Given that the system is in a correct state, it is guaranteed to stay in a correct state, provided that no fault happens (&quot;closure&quot;).

A system is said to be &quot;randomized self-stabilizing&quot; if and only if it is self-stabilizing and the expected number of rounds needed to reach a correct state is bounded by some constant formula_1.

Design of self-stabilization in the above-mentioned sense is well known to be a difficult job. In fact, a class of distributed algorithms do not have the property of local checking: the legitimacy of the network state cannot be evaluated by a single process. The most obvious case is Dijkstra&#x27;s token-ring defined above: no process can detect whether the network state is legitimate or not in the case where more than one token is present in non-neighboring processes. This suggests that self-stabilization of a distributed system is a sort of collective intelligence where each component is taking local actions, based on its local knowledge but eventually this guarantees global convergence at the end.

To help overcome the difficulty of designing self-stabilization as defined above, other types of stabilization were devised. For instance, &quot;weak stabilization&quot; is the property that a distributed system has a possibility to reach its legitimate behavior from every possible state.
Weak stabilization is easier to design as it just guarantees a &quot;possibility&quot; of convergence for some runs of the distributed system rather than convergence for every run.
A self-stabilizing algorithm is &quot;silent&quot; if and only if it converges to a global state where the values of communication registers used by the algorithm remain fixed.

== Related work ==
An extension of the concept of self-stabilization is that of superstabilization.
The intent here is to cope with dynamic distributed systems that undergo topological changes. In classical self-stabilization theory, arbitrary changes are viewed as errors where no guarantees are given until the system has stabilized again. With superstabilizing systems, there is a &quot;passage&quot; predicate that is always satisfied while the system&#x27;s topology is reconfigured.

A Theory that started within the area of self-stabilization is verifying (in a distributed manner) that the collection of the states of the nodes in a network obeys some predicate. That theory has grown beyond self-stabilization and led to notions such as &quot;distributed NP&quot; (a distributed version of NP (complexity)), distributed Zero Knowledge (a distributed version of Zero Knowledge), etc. The International Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity (SIRROCO) Prize for Innovation in Distributed Computing of 2024 was awarded for initiating that theory.

<text>Queensferry (, sometimes or ) is a town and community in Flintshire, Wales, lying on the River Dee near the border. The community includes the village of Sandycroft. It is between Connah&#x27;s Quay, Shotton and Saltney Ferry. Queensferry is also part of the wider Deeside conurbation.

==Description==
Its name derives from the ferries that crossed the River Dee. The settlement of Higher Ferry () is now known as Saltney, while Queensferry was named Lower Ferry (). The town&#x27;s name was changed to Kingsferry on the coronation of King George IV of the United Kingdom in 1820, and became Queensferry on the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1837.

Queensferry lies along the B5441 and B5129 roads, and is bypassed by the A494 dual carriageway. It is contiguous with Deeside. Queensferry is considered part of Deeside, which lends its name to many of Queensferry&#x27;s features, including the Deeside Leisure Centre, a sports and leisure venue that also hosts music concerts.

The town has a Memorial Institute rather than a cenotaph type of war memorial. It is a corrugated black and white building near the entrance to Asda from the coast road. The Jubilee Bridge, also known as the &quot;Blue Bridge&quot;, spans the River Dee. It is a double leaf rolling bascule bridge. The railway station served the town on the North Wales Coast Line between 1864 and 1966.

==Governance==
Queensferry is a ward and elects one county councillor to Flintshire County Council.

== Notable people ==
* Reg Spencer (1908–1981) footballer with 235 caps with Tranmere Rovers F.C.
* T. G. Jones (1917–2004) footballer with 178 caps for Everton F.C. and 17 for Wales
* Grenville Millington (born 1951) former football goalkeeper with 288 caps with Chester City F.C.

<text>The Deschutes River is a river in the U.S. state of Washington. Its headwaters are in the Bald Hills in Lewis County, and it empties into Budd Inlet of Puget Sound at Olympia in Thurston County. It was given its name by French fur traders, who called it Rivière des Chutes, or &quot;River of the Falls&quot;, a translation of the First Nations name for the site. (The city of Tumwater, founded in the same location, takes its name from the Chinook Jargon translation for &quot;waterfall&quot;.)

Tributaries of the river include Spurgeon Creek, Thurston Creek and Lake Lawrence.

==Recreation==
There are numerous parks along its course, including Pioneer Park and Tumwater Falls Park. A popular tubing stretch runs from Pioneer Park to Tumwater Falls.

The Chehalis Western Trail parallels the river for a stretch of , allowing users direct views and access to the river.

<doc id="661293" wikidata="Q2424760" url="?curid=661293" title="Mostyn">
<text>Mostyn is a village and community in Flintshire, Wales, and electoral ward lying on the estuary of the River Dee, located near the town of Holywell. It has a privately owned port that has in the past had a colliery and ironworks and was involved in the export of commodities, and in present times services the offshore wind industry and shipped the wings for the Airbus A380 which were manufactured at Broughton.

==History==
Mostyn was mentioned in the Doomsday Book of 1086. Henry Bolingbroke (later Henry IV) landed here in 1399 before attacking Richard II at Flint Castle. Coal was mined at Mostyn Colliery and iron production started in the mid nineteenth century. The combination of a colliery, iron works and the docks made this a profitable enterprise. Nineteen hundred people were employed at one time. The coal eventually became exhausted and the ironworks closed in 1965. 
Between 1848 and 1966 there was a railway station in the village on the Chester to Holyhead line. Mostyn once served as a port from which ferries used to sail (until 2004) to Dublin on the Liverpool-Dublin route. Today, manufactured wings for the Airbus A380 aircraft leave Mostyn on the ship &quot;Ville de Bordeaux&quot;, after travelling down the River Dee by barge from the Airbus wing factory at Broughton, Flintshire. See Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit for more details of the transportation. Mostyn&#x27;s port area is home to the headquarters of Warwick International Group Limited, manufacturers of bleach activators for detergent applications.
==Port of Mostyn==
The Port of Mostyn is privately owned and is one of the oldest ports in the country; in the past, it handled cargoes including steel, coal, timber, woodpulp, animal feedstuffs and fertilizers. Nowadays, it specialises in the assembly and installation of wind turbines. It has been involved in the construction of North Hoyle (constructed 2003–2004), Burbo Bank (2006–2007), Rhyl Flats (2008–2009) and Gwynt y Môr (2012–2015); it was involved in part of the work building Robin Rigg and Walney windfarms.

In early 2023, the Port of Mostyn applied to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) for a marine licence. This was to build a new 350 metre-long quay wall and reclaim 4.5 hectares of land behind it to create new berths for ships, as well as deepening existing berths and re-dredging the approach channel.

==Mostyn Hall==
Mostyn Hall is a large Grade I listed country house, set in extensive gardens; it lies around half a mile to the north-west of the village. It is surrounded by gardens and parkland, and is approached from the south driveway. The former gatehouse, &quot;Porth Mawr&quot;, lies to the south-west and a complex of farm buildings to the west.

==The village==
Just down the A548 road from Mostyn at Llanerch-y-Mor is the now closed Mostyn Fun Ship. The ship started life as the &quot;Duke of Lancaster&quot;, a car ferry and cruise ship. After it was permanently dry-docked in Mostyn, it earned its later name from its new operation as an arcade and bar.

==Governance==
Mostyn is also an electoral ward, coterminous with the community. It elects one county councillor to Flintshire County Council. A by-election was held on 31 July 2014 after the disqualification of the longstanding Independent councillor, Patrick Heesom,

On the 5th May 2022, as part of the most recent 2022 Welsh local elections, Mostyn elected Pamela Banks who was represented as an Independent, by a 26% majority as former councillor Patrick Heesom saw defeat.

== Demographics ==

=== Languages ===
According to the United Kingdom Census 2021, 14.9 per cent of all usual residents aged 3+ in Mostyn can speak Welsh. 22.5 per cent of the population noted that they could speak, read, write or understand Welsh. The 2011 census noted 18.2 per cent of all usual residents aged 3 years and older in the village could speak Welsh.

=== Country of Birth ===
The 2011 Census noted that 98.0 per cent of the population was born in the United Kingdom; 64.0 per cent of the population was born in Wales and 33.1 per cent of the population was born in England.

<doc id="661295" wikidata="Q652622" url="?curid=661295" title="Périgordian">
<text>Périgordian is a term for several distinct but related Upper Palaeolithic cultures which are thought by some archaeologists to represent a contiguous tradition. Thought to have existed between c.35,000 BP and c.20,000 BP the Perigordian was theorized by prehistorians (namely ).

The earliest culture in the tradition is the Châtelperronian which is thought to have produced denticulate tools and flint knives. It is argued that this was superseded by the Gravettian with its Font Robert points and Noailles burins. The tradition culminated in the proto-Magdalenian. 

Critics have pointed out that no continuous sequence of Périgordian occupation has yet been found, and that the tradition requires it to have co-existed separately from the Aurignacian industry rather than being differing industries that existed before and afterwards.

<doc id="661316" wikidata="Q2567716" url="?curid=661316" title="Pencoed">
<text>Pencoed (also Pen-coed); ) is a town and community in the county borough of Bridgend, Wales. It straddles the M4 motorway north east of Bridgend and is situated on the Ewenny River. At the 2011 census it had a population of around 9,166.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The name appears as &quot;Penkoyt&quot; in a 1303 deed of Ewenny Priory and as &quot;Pencoyd&quot; in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The name is likely a contraction of &quot;pen-y-coed&quot; (head/top/end of the forest/wood) and has historically been given as both Pen-coed and Pencoed. While some local business, roads and signage use the hyphenated version, the official spelling in both English and Welsh is &quot;Pencoed&quot;.

The standard pronunciation in modern Welsh is or . However, the diphthong &#x27;oe&#x27; in a monosyllable is generally reduced to a long vowel &#x27;o&#x27; [o:] in South Wales, so the local pronunciation is . This is sometimes spelled as &quot;Pen-côd&quot; in texts written in Gwenhwyseg (the local dialect).

==History==
The earliest evidence of habitation in the area is the nearby Ogof y Pebyll (&quot;Tents Cave&quot;) or Ogof Coed-y-Mwstwr (&quot;Hubbub Wood Cave&quot;)), which is a scheduled monument and appears to have been inhabited during Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. Worked flint flakes have been found, along with the teeth of numerous mammals of many different species.

The area remained heavily wooded and sparsely populated until the eighteenth century. A map of 1729 shows &quot;coal pitts&quot; in the area and coal, lime, timbers and stone all contributed to the growth of the town. The development of the industrial villages was heavily influenced by Isambard Kingdom Brunel’s route for the South Wales Railway and the construction of a Railway Station between Pencoed and Penprysg in 1856. The two hamlets became the centre of the town of Pencoed. In just over a century and a half, Pencoed’s population increased from less than 500 to more than 12,000.

==Present day==
The town is in the Ewenny Valley and is divided by the M4 motorway near Junction 35, although almost all of the town lies to the north of the M4. About two miles north of the town, the upland relief of the South Wales Valleys starts. To the south are the rolling countryside of the Vale of Glamorgan and the rugged north coast of the Bristol Channel.

The town consists of three distinct areas, which were once four small hamlets. To the north is Penprysg (&quot;copse end&quot;), which lies at the end of the low ridge (100 m) of &quot;Cefn Hirgoed&quot; (&quot;long wood ridge&quot;). To the west is &quot;Hendre&quot; (&quot;lowland winter homestead&quot;, literally &quot;old settlement&quot;) which rises gently from the railway line in the centre of the town towards the common land at &quot;Ystadwaun&quot;, on older maps as &quot;Ystad y Waun&quot; and &quot;Gwastadwaun&quot; (&quot;level moor&quot;). The central and eastern part of the town, which lies on the valley floor near the railway, consists of Pencoed itself and &quot;Felindre&quot; (&quot;mill settlement&quot;). There are numerous streams rising and running through the town, and two main rivers, the &quot;Ewenni Fawr&quot; (Great Ewenny) and the &quot;Ewenni Fach&quot; (Little Ewenny). At the centre of the town, close to the station, is the war memorial (known locally as the Monument), the shopping centre and the local Community Hall (Pencoed Miners&#x27; Welfare Hall). The town is well provided with sports facilities, schools, pubs and clubs. A new development, Earlswood Parc, was announced in 2002 and now has been completed, incorporating various Westbury built homes and Bocam business park.

The current mayor is Councillor Barry Doughty.

Pencoed hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1998.

The Raspberry Pi single-board computer is manufactured at the Sony Technology Centre in Pencoed, which produces 44,000 every week.

==Sport==
Pencoed is noted for producing Rugby Union players. Pencoed RFC has produced a number of international players for both Wales and the British and Irish Lions. Most notably, three Pencoed players (Gareth Thomas, Gareth Cooper and Gavin Henson) all took part in the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand with Thomas captaining the Test team.

==Twinning==
Pencoed has twinning arrangements with:
* Waldsassen, Germany
* Plouzané, France

<doc id="661317" wikidata="Q5168730" url="?curid=661317" title="Copper Green">
<text>Copper Green is reportedly one of several code names for a U.S. black ops program in which coercive psychological and physical measures were used on detainees in military prisons. 
Investigative journalist Seymour Hersh reported on the term in an article in the May 24, 2004 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. According to Hersh, the task force was formed with the direct approval of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and run by Deputy Undersecretary Stephen Cambone. Hersh claims the Special Access Program (SAP) members were told &quot;Grab whom you must. Do what you want.&quot; The program allegedly designed physical coercion and sexual humiliation techniques for use against Muslim Arab men specifically, to retrieve information from suspects, and to blackmail them into becoming informants.

According to the article, the sexual humiliation techniques were based on the book, &quot;The Arab Mind&quot;, written by cultural anthropologist Raphael Patai in 1973. The book claimed to be a &quot;study of Arab culture and psychology&quot;. According to Hersh&#x27;s anonymous intelligence source, the Patai book was &quot;the bible of the neocons on Arab behavior&quot;, which gave life to two themes: &quot;One, that Arabs only understand force and, two, that the biggest weakness of Arabs is shame and humiliation&quot;.

Hersh claims to have spoken to a senior CIA official who said the program was designed by Rumsfeld to wrest control of information from the CIA, and place it in the hands of the Pentagon. According to Hersh&#x27;s sources, the program was so successful in Afghanistan, that Cambone decided to introduce the SAP program to operations during 2003 invasion of Iraq, eventually leading to the use of common soldiers instead of using special ops forces exclusively. In Hersh&#x27;s view, the program was used on detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison, leading directly to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal.

Department of Defense spokesperson Lawrence Di Rita issued a statement about the accusations, referring to them as &quot;outlandish, conspiratorial, and filled with error and anonymous conjecture&quot;. Senators on Capitol Hill, most notably the former POW John McCain, promised to investigate the reported claims, &quot;regardless of where it leads&quot;.
==In popular culture==
Copper Green was mentioned in author JD Wallace&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Silent Cats: Deadly Dance&quot;. The male hero, who is based on a real person who the author claims to know personally, was an interrogator who worked on the Copper Green task force, among other task force groups.

Copper Green was mentioned in Lt. Col. Anthony Shaffer&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Operation Dark Heart&quot; on page 257: &quot;The interrogation program, called Copper Green, was authorized, but a lot of us felt it wasn&#x27;t appropriate and just wasn&#x27;t right.&quot; The Pentagon blacked out the words &quot;Copper Green&quot; in the second printing.

<doc id="661319" wikidata="Q3123126" url="?curid=661319" title="Robert Wright (journalist)">
<text>Robert Wright (born January 15, 1957) is an American author and journalist known for his wide-ranging interests in philosophy, society, science (especially evolutionary psychology), history, politics, international relations, and religion. He has published five books: &quot;Three Scientists and Their Gods: Looking for Meaning in an Age of Information&quot; (1988), &quot;The Moral Animal&quot; (1994), &quot;&quot; (1999), &quot;The Evolution of God&quot; (2009), and &quot;Why Buddhism is True&quot; (2017). Wright has taught at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania; more recently, in 2019 he was Visiting Professor of Science and Religion at Union Theological Seminary, New York.

In addition to teaching, lecturing, books, and journalism, Wright has been an innovator in the development of content on the Internet. He is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Bloggingheads.tv, the founder and editor-in-chief of Meaningoflife.tv, the founder and chief correspondent of the Nonzero Newsletter and Nonzero Podcast, and the creator of the Nonzero Foundation.

==Early life and education==
Wright was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, into a Southern Baptist family and attended public secondary schools in San Francisco, California, and San Antonio, Texas. A self-described &quot;Army brat&quot;, Wright attended Texas Christian University for a year in the late 1970s, before transferring to Princeton University, where he studied sociobiology, a precursor to evolutionary psychology. His teachers at Princeton included author John McPhee, whose style influenced Wright&#x27;s first book, &quot;Three Scientists and Their Gods: Looking for Meaning in an Age of Information&quot;.

==Career==
===Journalism===
Wright was employed as Senior Editor at &quot;The Sciences&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and as an editor at &quot;The Wilson Quarterly&quot;. As a contributing editor at &quot;The New Republic&quot;, he co-authored the &quot;TRB&quot; column. He has also worked at &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot;, and has written for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. He has occasionally contributed to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, putting in a stint as guest columnist in April 2007 and in 2010 acting as a contributor to The Opinionator, a web-only opinion page. Wright assumed the title of senior editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; on January 1, 2012. In February 2015 the magazine&#x27;s author page describes him as &quot;a former senior editor at &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.&quot;

===University teaching and research===
In early 2000s, Wright taught occasionally at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania, leading a graduate seminar called &quot;Religion and Human Nature&quot; and teaching an undergraduate course called &quot;The Evolution of Religion.&quot; At Princeton, Wright was a &quot;Laurence S. Rockefeller Visiting Fellow&quot; and co-taught a graduate seminar with Peter Singer on the biological basis of moral intuition. In 2014, Wright taught a six-week Coursera MOOC on &quot;Buddhism and Modern Psychology&quot;. In 2019, Wright was a Visiting Professor of Science and Religion at Union Theological Seminary, New York. Also in 2019, Wright was a Senior Fellow at the think tank New America.

===Meaningoflife.tv===
In 2002, Wright ventured into video-on-Internet with his &quot;MeaningofLife.tv&quot; website, developed by Greg Dingle, where he interviewed a range of thinkers on their ideas about science, philosophy, meditation, spirituality, and other topics. &quot;Meaningoflife.tv&quot; is sponsored by &quot;Slate&quot; magazine, and made possible through funding by the Templeton Foundation. Other hosts include John Horgan, Daniel Kaufman, Nikita Petrov, and Aryeh Cohen-Wade.

===Bloggingheads.tv===

On November 1, 2005, Wright, blogger Mickey Kaus, and Greg Dingle launched Bloggingheads.tv, a current-events diavlog. Bloggingheads diavlogs are conducted via webcam, and can be viewed online or downloaded either as WMV or MP4 video files or as MP3 sound files. New diavlogs are posted approximately 5-10 times a week and are archived. While many diavlogs feature Wright, other hosts at Bloggingheads.tv include Glenn Loury, John McWhorter, Bill Scher, Matt Lewis, Kat Rosenfield, Phoebe Maltz-Bovy, and Aryeh Cohen-Wade.

==Views on religion==
Wright has written extensively on the topic of religion, particularly in &quot;The Evolution of God.&quot; In 2009, When asked by Bill Moyers if God is a figment of the human imagination, Wright responded:

On &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, Wright said he was &quot;not an atheist&quot; but did not subscribe to any of the three Abrahamic religions. He opposes creationism, including intelligent design. Wright has a materialist conception of natural selection; however, he is intrigued by the possibility of some larger purpose unfolding, natural selection possibly being itself the product of design, in the context of teleology. Wright describes what he calls the &quot;changing moods of God,&quot; arguing that religion is adaptable and based on the political, economic, and social circumstances of the culture, rather than strictly scriptural interpretation.

Wright has also been critical of organized atheism. He has described himself as a secular humanist. Wright makes a distinction between religion being wrong and bad and resists the notion that its bad effects necessarily outweigh its good effects. He sees organized atheism as attempting to actively convert people in the same way as many religions do. Wright has said that it is counterproductive to think of religion as being the root cause of today&#x27;s problems.

In &quot;Why Buddhism is True&quot;, Wright investigates a secular, Westernized form of Buddhism focusing on the practice of mindfulness meditation and stripped of the element of reincarnation. He believes Buddhism&#x27;s diagnosis of the causes of human suffering is largely vindicated by evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, justifying his book&#x27;s title. He further argues that the modern psychological idea of the modularity of mind resonates with the Buddhist teaching of no-self (&quot;anatman&quot;).

<doc id="661321" wikidata="Q6468272" url="?curid=661321" title="Lach">
<text>Lach is an American singer-songwriter who founded the Antifolk movement, which is cited as a main inspiration by contemporary performers like Beck, Jeffrey Lewis, Hamell on Trial, The Moldy Peaches and Regina Spektor in the US and Laura Marling in the UK.

Lach has released six albums, a book of poetry, a fantasy novel, and was the star (writer and host) of a critically acclaimed series on BBC Radio 4 called &quot;The Lach Chronicles&quot;.

==Early life==
Lach was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in suburban Rockland County. He learned to play classical piano at a young age, but turned to rock music after discovering punk bands like the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, and the Jam. Lach went to college but quickly dropped out to live in Las Vegas, resuming his education at Boston University, where he met his later bassist Geoffrey Notkin.

==Career==
Lach moved to Greenwich Village in New York City in 1983, looking to play the renowned Folk City club. Having been rejected by the club&#x27;s bookers, who believed his music was too &quot;punk&quot;, he moved to the Lower East Side, opening his own illegal after-hours club, the Fort. The opening of the Fort coincided with the New York City Folk Festival, so Lach held an event at his club called the New York Antifolk Festival, which remains a popular event in the East Village.

In 1990, Lach put out his debut CD, &quot;Contender&quot; on the Goldcastle label. The album received rave reviews in the press and considerable radio play, but the record label folded three months later. Lach moved to San Francisco releasing an EP, &quot;Family Values Pack&quot;, containing &quot;The Hillary Clinton Song&quot; which aired on over 600 stations during Bill Clinton&#x27;s first campaign.

In 1993, Lach returned to New York City and started The Fort up again at The Sidewalk Cafe in the East Village, ushering in a new wave of anti-folk. In 1997 Lach started his own label, Fortified Records, and released, in conjunction with Shanachie Records, &quot;Lach&#x27;s Antihoot: Live from the Fort&quot;. Fortified subsequently released downtown comedian Rick Shapiro&#x27;s &quot;Unconditional Love&quot;, produced by Lach (1998) and Major Matt Mason USA&#x27;s &quot;Me, Me, Me&quot; (2000). In 1999 Fortified released Lach&#x27;s second album &quot;Blang!&quot;, produced by Richard Barone.

September 18, 2001 saw the domestic release of &quot;Kids Fly Free&quot;, again produced by Richard Barone with a 16-page lyric booklet illustrated by Daniel Johnston. Tours of the UK by Lach and other NYC anti-folkers such as The Moldy Peaches, Hamell On Trial and Jeffrey Lewis sparked the beginnings of the UK scene, inspiring such British artists as Milk Kan, Filthy Pedro, David Cronberg&#x27;s Wife, Sgt. Joe Buzzfuzz and Laura Marling. The 12 Bar Club began hosting monthly anti-folk nights called Blang!

In 2002 Lach signed with the Agency Group as his exclusive European booking agent, and with Steve Hawkins as his tour manager. Track Records released &quot;Kids Fly Free&quot; in the UK on May 7. Lach was also featured on &quot;Antifolk Vol.1&quot; (Rough Trade), compiled by The Moldy Peaches.

In 2004, Sanctuary Press released &quot;Waking Up in New York City: A Musical Tour of The Big Apple&quot; by Mike Evans, with a chapter devoted to Lach. Lach&#x27;s band &#x27;Lach and The Secrets&#x27;, featuring Billy Ficca on drums and Roy Edroso on bass, arrived in the UK In March that year for eight shows in eight nights including a show at The Basement Club organized by Strokes producer Gordon Raphael. Lach and The Secrets released their album, &quot;Today&quot;. Lach toured UK and France as a solo artist, performing 35 dates supporting Suzanne Vega, Television and The Fine Young Cannibals.

In 2005, he toured the UK including five dates sharing the bill with The Casbah Club. In 2006, Lach organized the biggest &#x27;Fortified Summer Antifolk Fest&#x27; yet with a concert in Tompkins Square Park, an Antifolk parade and a special guest set from Suzanne Vega. Lach toured the UK including an Antifolk Fest at The Barfly in London featuring Lach headlining a show with nine other UK Antifolk acts.

In 2007, Lach signed with Primary UK Booking Agency. Lach finished his fifth album &quot;The Calm Before&quot; recording once again with Billy Ficca, Richard Barone, Mike Visceglia, Chris Barron and Lydia Ooghe at Studio G in Brooklyn.

In 2008, Lach said goodbye to Sidewalk Café and his weekly Antihoot, New York&#x27;s longest running open mic (&quot;A Manhattan Institution&quot;). A subsequent documentary on Lach&#x27;s farewell was filmed YouTube. &quot;The Calm Before&quot; was released on Fortified Records and Lach toured the US for the first time as well as the UK and the Netherlands. The album hit the College Charts, becoming Fortified&#x27;s best seller. In 2009, he toured the UK with Neil Halstead. In 2010, Lach completed a new album, &quot;Ramshackle Heart&quot; which was recorded in the UK with Halstead. Lach took on running two nights a week (the &#x27;Tuesday Antihoot&#x27; and Wednesday&#x27;s &#x27;Lach Presents&#x27; series) at the Webster Hall in New York. Lach subsequently took on the role of executive producer of the venue.

After debuting his one-man show &#x27;The Day I Went Insane&#x27; in the UK, Lach was discovered by BBC producer Richard Melvin and comedy producer Karen Koren. He was then invited to headline The Edinburgh Fringe Festival&#x27;s venue, The Gilded Balloon.

Lach also toured the UK extensively including shows with Hamell on Trial, Michelle Shocked, Dean Friedman, The Spin Doctors and Florence and The Machine.

In 2013, he became executive producer of Edinburgh&#x27;s Henry&#x27;s Cellar Bar revamping the look and style of the venue and programming performances from such stars as Thomas Truax and Toby Goodshank. At the venue, he started the Mondays Antihoot Open Stage, Tuesdays Songwriter&#x27;s Cellar and Wednesday&#x27;s Antihoot Radio Night. Antihoot Radio Night featured a weekly radio sit-com written by Lach and featuring some of the top comics in Scotland. His 2013 Edinburgh Fringe show &quot;Anticdotes&quot; was produced in conjunction with transgressive comedian Bob Slayer&#x27;s Heroes of The Fringe.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;

The Châtelperronian is a proposed industry of the Upper Palaeolithic, the existence of which is debated. It represents both the only Upper Palaeolithic industry made by Neanderthals and the earliest Upper Palaeolithic industry in central and southwestern France, as well as in northern Spain. It derives its name from Châtelperron, the French village closest to the type site, the cave La Grotte des Fées.

The Châtelperronian lasted from c. 45,000 to c. 40,000 BP, and was preceded by the Mousterian industry. The industry produced denticulate stone tools, and a distinctive flint knife with a single cutting edge and a blunt, curved back. The use of ivory at Châtelperronian sites appears to be more frequent than that of the later Aurignacian, while antler tools have not been found. It is followed by the Aurignacian industry.

Scholars who question its existence claim that it is an archaeological mix of Mousterian and Aurignacian layers. The Châtelperronian industry may relate to the origins of the very similar Gravettian culture. French archaeologists have traditionally classified both cultures together under the name Périgordian, &quot;Early Perigordian&quot; being equivalent to the Châtelperronian and all the other phases corresponding to the Gravettian, though this scheme is not often used by Anglophone authors.

==Important sites and lithic production and associations==
Large thick flakes/small blocks were used for cores, and were prepared with a crest over a long smooth surface. Using one or two striking points, long thin blades were detached. Direct percussion with a soft hammer was likely used for accuracy. Thicker blades made in this process were often converted into side scrapers, burins were often created in the same manner from debitage as well.

The manner of production is a solid continuation of the Mousterian but the ivory adornments found in association are similar to those made by the Aurignacian. The technological refinement of the Châtelperronian and neighbouring Uluzzian in Central-Southern Italy is often argued to be the product of cultural influence from &quot;H. sapiens&quot; that lived nearby.

==Dispute over disruption of the site==
João Zilhão and colleagues argue that the findings are complicated by disturbance of the site in the 19th century, and conclude that the apparent pattern of Aurignacian/Châtelperronian inter-stratification is an artifact of disturbance. Others think the Châtelperronian itself is an artifact of disturbance. Paul Mellars and colleagues have criticized the analysis of Zilhão et al., and argue that the original excavation by Delporte was not affected by disturbance. 
Paul Mellars, however, now has concluded on the basis of new radiocarbon dating by Thomas Higham of the decorative artifacts of Grotte du Renne &quot;that there was [a] strong possibility—if not probability—
that [decorative artefacts] were stratigraphically intrusive into the Châtelperronian deposits from .. overlying Proto-Aurignacian levels&quot; and that &quot;The central and inescapable implication of the new dating results from the Grotte du Renne is that the single most impressive and hitherto widely cited pillar of evidence for the presence of complex “symbolic” behavior among the late Neanderthal populations in Europe has now effectively collapsed.&quot; Subsequent research led by Jean-Jacques Hublin argues, using new dates, that the Châtelperronian tools were produced by Neanderthals. Unlike Higham&#x27;s dates, which were taken directly from the decorative material, Hublin&#x27;s were taken from associated bones. To Higham, dates taken directly from the decorative material are more convincing and should be given priority over those from associated material. To Hublin, Higham&#x27;s dates were contaminated with varnish applied to the decorative material in the 1960s. Hublin&#x27;s team subsequently used proteomic evidence to support their conclusion. 

==In popular culture==

Author Jared Diamond argues in his 1991 non-fiction book, &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot;, that Châtelperron may represent a community of Neanderthals who, to some extent, had adopted the culture of the Early European modern humans that had established themselves in the surrounding area, which would account for the signs of the hybrid culture found at the site. Diamond compares these hypothetical Neanderthal holdouts to more recent Indigenous peoples of the Americas in North and South America, who adopted European technologies such as firearms or domestication of horses in order to survive in an environment dominated by more technologically advanced competitors.

The fifth book of Jean Auel&#x27;s Earth&#x27;s Children series, &quot;The Shelters of Stone&quot;, 2002, and the sixth book &quot;The Land of the Painted Caves&quot; 2010 are set in this region of modern-day France, during this period.

<text>The Fairey Rotodyne was a 1950s British compound gyroplane designed and built by Fairey Aviation and intended for commercial and military uses. A development of the earlier Fairey Jet Gyrodyne, which had established a world helicopter speed record, the Rotodyne featured a tip-jet-powered rotor that burned a mixture of fuel and compressed air bled from two wing-mounted Napier Eland turboprops. The rotor was driven for vertical takeoffs, landings and hovering, as well as low-speed translational flight, but autorotated during cruise flight with all engine power applied to two propellers.

One prototype was built. Although the Rotodyne was promising in concept and successful in trials, the programme was eventually cancelled. The termination has been attributed to the type failing to attract any commercial orders; this was in part due to concerns over the high levels of rotor tip jet noise generated in flight. Politics had also played a role in the lack of orders (the project was government funded) which ultimately doomed the project.

== Development ==
=== Background ===

From the late 1930s onwards, considerable progress was made on an entirely new field of aeronautics in the form of rotary-wing aircraft. While some progress in Britain had been made prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, wartime priorities placed upon the aviation industry meant that British programmes to develop rotorcraft and helicopters were marginalised at best. In the immediate post-war climate, the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy elected to procure American-developed helicopters in the form of the Sikorsky R-4 and Sikorsky R-6, known locally as the &quot;Hoverfly I&quot; and &quot;Hoverfly II&quot; respectively. Experience from the operation of these rotorcraft, along with the extensive examination that was conducted upon captured German helicopter prototypes, stimulated considerable interest within the armed services and industry alike in developing Britain&#x27;s own advanced rotorcraft.

Fairey Aviation was one such company that was intrigued by the potential of rotary-wing aircraft, and proceeded to develop the Fairey FB-1 Gyrodyne in accordance with Specification E.16/47. The Gyrodyne was a unique aircraft in its own right that defined a third type of rotorcraft, including autogyro and helicopter. Having little in common with the later Rotodyne, it was characterised by its inventor, Dr JAJ Bennett, formerly chief technical officer of the pre-Second World War Cierva Autogiro Company as an intermediate aircraft designed to combine the safety and simplicity of the autogyro with hovering performance. Its rotor was driven in all phases of flight with collective pitch being an automatic function of shaft torque, with a side-mounted propeller providing both thrust for forward flight and rotor torque correction. On 28 June 1948, the FB-1 proved its potential during test flights when it achieved a world airspeed record, having attaining a recorded speed of . The programme was not trouble-free however, a fatal accident involving one of the prototypes occurring in April 1949 due to poor machining of a rotor blade flapping link retaining nut. The second FB-1 was modified to investigate a tip-jet driven rotor with propulsion provided by propellers mounted at the tip of each stub wing, being renamed the Jet Gyrodyne.

During 1951 and 1952, British European Airways (BEA) internally formulated its own requirement for a passenger-carrying rotorcraft, commonly referred to the &quot;Bealine-Bus&quot; or &quot;BEA Bus&quot;. This was to be a multi-engined rotorcraft capable of serving as a short-haul airliner, BEA envisioned the type as being typically flown between major cities and carrying a minimum of 30 passengers in order to be economical; keen to support the initiative, the Ministry of Supply proceeded to sponsor a series of design studies to be conducted in support of the BEA requirement. Both civil and government bodies had predicted the requirement for such rotorcraft, and viewed it as being only a matter of time before they would become commonplace in Britain&#x27;s transport network.

The BEA Bus requirement was met with a variety of futuristic proposals; both practical and seemingly impractical submissions were made by a number of manufacturers. Amongst these, Fairey had also chosen to submit its designs and to participate to meet the requirement; according to aviation author Derek Wood: &quot;one design, particularly, seemed to show promise and this was the Fairey Rotordyne&quot;. Fairey had produced multiple arrangements and configurations for the aircraft, typically varying in the powerplants used and the internal capacity; the firm made its first submission to the Ministry on 26 January 1949. Within two months, Fairey had produced a further three alternative submissions, centring on the use of engines such as the Rolls-Royce Dart and Armstrong Siddeley Mamba. In October 1950, an initial contract for the development of a 16,000 lb, four-bladed rotorcraft was awarded. The Fairey design, which was considerably revised over the years, received government funding to support its development.

Early on in development, Fairey found that securing access to engines to power its design proved to be difficult. In November 1950, Rolls-Royce chairman Lord Hives protested that the design resources of his company were being stretched too thinly across multiple projects; accordingly, the initially-selected Dart engine was switched to the Mamba engine of rival firm Armstrong Siddeley. By July 1951, Fairey had re-submitted proposals using the Mamba engine in two and three-engine layouts, supporting all-up weights of and respectively; the adopted configuration of pairing the Mamba engine to auxiliary compressors was known as the &quot;Cobra&quot;. Due to complaints by Armstrong Siddeley that it too was lacking resources, Fairey also proposed the alternative use of engines such as the de Havilland Goblin and the Rolls-Royce Derwent turbojet to drive the forward propellers.

Fairey did not enjoy a positive relationship with de Havilland however, so instead they chose to use D. Napier &amp; Son and its Eland turboshaft engine in April 1953. Following the selection of the Eland, the basic design of the rotorcraft, known as the &quot;Rotodyne Y&quot;, soon emerged; it was powered by a pair of Eland N.El.3 engines furnished with auxiliary compressors and a large-section four-blade main rotor, with a projected all-up weight of 33,000 lb. At the same time, a projected enlarged version, designated as the &quot;Rotodyne Z&quot;, outfitted with more powerful Eland N.El.7 engines and an all-up weight of 39,000 lb, was proposed as well.

=== Contract ===

In April 1953, the Ministry of Supply contracted for the building of a single prototype of the Rotodyne Y, powered by the Eland engine, later designated with the serial number &quot;XE521&quot;, for research purposes. As contracted, the Rotodyne would have been the largest transport helicopter of its day, seating a maximum of 40 to 50 passengers, while possessing a cruise speed of 150 mph and a range of 250 nautical miles. At the time of the award, Fairey had estimated that £710,000 would cover the costs of producing the airframe. With a view to an aircraft that would meet regulatory approval in the shortest time, Fairey&#x27;s designers worked to meet the Civil Airworthiness Requirements for both helicopters and similar-sized twin-engined aircraft. A one-sixth scale rotorless model was extensively wind tunnel tested for fixed-wing performance. A smaller (1/15th-scale) model with a powered rotor was used for downwash investigations.

While the prototype was being built, funding for the programme reached a crisis. Cuts in defence spending led the Ministry of Defence to withdraw its support, pushing the burden of the costs onto any possible civilian customer. The government agreed to maintain funding for the project only if, among other qualifications, Fairey and Napier (through their parent English Electric) contributed to development costs of the Rotodyne and the Eland engine respectively. As a result of disagreements with Fairey on matters of policy, Dr Bennett left the firm to join Hiller Helicopters in California; responsibility for the Rotodyne&#x27;s development was assumed by Dr George S Hislop, who became the firm&#x27;s chief engineer.

The manufacturing of the prototype&#x27;s fuselage, wings, and rotor assembly was conducted at Fairey&#x27;s facility in Hayes, Hillingdon, West London, while construction of the tail assembly was performed at the firm&#x27;s factory in Stockport, Greater Manchester and final assembly was performed at White Waltham Airfield, Maidenhead. In addition, a full-scale static test rig was produced at RAF Boscombe Down to support the programme; the static rig featured a fully operational rotor and powerplant arrangement which was demonstrated on multiple occasions, including a 25-hour approval testing for the Ministry.

While construction of the first prototype was underway, prospects for the Rotodyne appeared positive; according to Wood, there was interest in the type from both civil and military quarters. BEA was monitoring the progress of the programme with interest; it was outwardly expected that the airline would place an order shortly after the issuing of an order for a militarised version of the rotorcraft. The American company Kaman Helicopters also showed strong interest in the project, and was known to have studied it closely as the firm considered the potential for licensed production of the Rotodyne for both civil and military customers.

Due to army and RAF interest, development of the Rotodyne had been funded out of the defence budget for a time. During 1956, the Defence Research Policy Committee had declared that there was no military interest in the type, which quickly led to the Rotodyne becoming solely reliant upon civil budgets as a research/civil prototype aircraft instead. After a series of political arguments, proposals, and bargaining; in December 1956, HM Treasury authorised work on both the Rotodyne and Eland engine to be continued until the end of September 1957. Amongst the demands exerted by the Treasury were that the aircraft had to be both a technical success and would need to acquire a firm order from BEA; both Fairey and English Electric (Napier&#x27;s parent company) also had to take on a portion of the costs for its development as well.

=== Testing and evaluation ===
On 6 November 1957, the prototype performed its maiden flight, piloted by chief helicopter test pilot Squadron Leader W. Ron Gellatly and assistant chief helicopter test pilot Lieutenant Commander John G.P. Morton as second pilot. The first flight had originally been projected to take place in 1956; however, delay was viewed as inevitable with an entirely new concept such as used by the Rotodyne.

On 10 April 1958, the Rotodyne achieved its first successful transition from vertical to horizontal and then back into vertical flight. On 5 January 1959, the Rotodyne set a world speed record in the convertiplane category, at 190.9 mph (307.2 km/h), over a 60-mile (100 km) closed circuit. As well as being fast, the rotorcraft had a safety feature: it could hover with one engine shut down with its propeller feathered, and the prototype demonstrated several landings as an autogyro. The prototype was demonstrated several times at the Farnborough and Paris air shows, regularly amazing onlookers. In one instance, it even lifted a 100 ft girder bridge.

The Rotodyne&#x27;s tip drive and unloaded rotor made its performance far better when compared to pure helicopters and other forms of &quot;convertiplanes.&quot; The aircraft could be flown at 175 kn (324 km/h) and pulled into a steep climbing turn without demonstrating any adverse handling characteristics.

Throughout the world, interest was growing in the prospect of direct city-to-city transport. The market for the Rotodyne was that of a medium-haul &quot;flying bus&quot;: It would take off vertically from an inner-city heliport, with all lift coming from the tip-jet driven rotor, and then would increase airspeed, eventually with all power from the engines being transferred to the propellers with the rotor autorotating. In this mode, the collective pitch, and hence drag, of the rotor could be reduced, as the wings would be taking as much as half of the craft&#x27;s weight. The Rotodyne would then cruise at speeds of about 150 kn (280 km/h) to another city, &quot;e.g.&quot;, London to Paris, where the rotor tip-jet system would be restarted for landing vertically in the city centre. When the Rotodyne landed and the rotor stopped moving, its blades drooped downward from the hub. To avoid striking the vertical stabilisers on startup, the tips of these fins were angled down to the horizontal. They were raised once the rotor had spun up.

By January 1959, British European Airways (BEA) announced that it was interested in the purchase of six aircraft, with a possibility of up to 20, and had issued a letter of intent stating such, on the condition that all requirements, including noise levels, were met. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had also placed an order for 12 military transport versions. New York Airways signed a letter of intent for the purchase of five at $2m each, with an option of 15 more albeit with qualifications, after calculating that a larger Rotodyne could operate at half the seat mile cost of helicopters; however, unit costs were deemed too high for very short hauls of 10 to 50 miles, and the Civil Aeronautics Board was opposed to rotorcraft competing with fixed-wing on longer routes. Japan Air Lines, which had sent a team to Britain to evaluate the Rotodyne prototype, stated it would experiment with Rotodyne between Tokyo Airport and the city itself, and was interested in using it on the Tokyo-Osaka route as well.

According to rumours, the U.S. Army was also interested in buying around 200 Rotodynes. Fairey was keen to secure funding from the American Mutual Aid programme, but could not persuade the RAF to order the minimum necessary 25 rotorcraft needed; at one point, the firm even considered providing a single Rotodyne to Eastern Airlines via Kaman Helicopters, Fairey&#x27;s U.S. licensee, so that it could be hired out to the U.S. Army for trials. All Rotodynes destined for US customers were to have been manufactured by Kaman in Bloomfield, Connecticut.

Financing from the government had been secured again on the proviso that firm orders would be gained from BEA. The civilian orders were dependent on the noise issues being satisfactorily met; the importance of this factor had led to Fairey developing 40 different noise suppressors by 1955. In December 1955, Dr Hislop said he was certain that the noise issue could be &#x27;eliminated&#x27;. According to Wood, the two most serious problems revealed with the Rotodyne during flight testing was the noise issue and the weight of the rotor system, the latter being 2,233 lb above the original projection of 3,270 lb.

=== Issues and cancellation ===
In 1959, the British government, seeking to cut costs, decreed that the number of aircraft firms should be lowered and set forth its expectations for mergers in airframe and aero-engine companies. By delaying or withholding access to defence contracts, the British firms could be forced into mergers; Duncan Sandys, Minister of Aviation, expressed this policy to Fairey and made it known that the price of continued government backing for the Rotodyne would be for Fairey to virtually withdraw from all other initiatives in the aviation field. Ultimately, Saunders-Roe and the helicopter division of Bristol were incorporated with Westland; in May 1960, Fairey Aviation was also taken over by Westland. By this time, the Rotodyne had flown almost 1,000 people for 120 hours in 350 flights and conducted a total of 230 transitions between helicopter and autogiro — with no accidents.

By 1958, the Treasury was already expressing its opposition to further financing for the programme. The matter was escalated to the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, who wrote to Aubrey Jones, the Minister of Supply, on 6 June 1958, stating that &quot;this project must not be allowed to die&quot;. Considerable importance was placed upon BEA supporting the Rotodyne by issuing an order; however, the airline refused to procure the aircraft until it was satisfied that guarantees were given over its performance, economy, and noise criteria. Shortly after Fairey&#x27;s merger with Westland, the latter was issued a £4 million development contract for the Rotodyne, which was intended to see the type enter service with BEA as a result.

As flight testing with the Rotodyne prototype had proceeded, Fairey had become increasingly dissatisfied with Napier and the Eland engine as progress to improve the latter had been less than expected. For the extended 48-seat model of the Rotodyne to be achieved, the uprated 3,500 ehp Eland N.E1.7 would be necessary; of the estimated £7 million needed to produce the larger aircraft, £3 million would be for its engines. BEA was particularly supportive of a larger aircraft, potentially seating as many as 66 passengers, which would have required a still-far greater sum of money to achieve. Fairey was already struggling to achieve the stated performance of the Eland engine and had resorted to adopting a richer fuel mixture to get the necessary power, a side effect of which was to further aggravate the noticeable noise issue as well as reducing fuel efficiency. As a result of being unable to resolve the issues with the Eland, Fairey opted to adopt the rival Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engine to power the larger Rotodyne Z instead.

The larger Rotodyne Z design could be developed to take 57 to 75 passengers and, when equipped with the Tyne engines (5,250 shp/3,910 kW), would have a projected cruising speed of 200 kn (370 km/h). It would be able to carry nearly 8 tons (7 tonnes) of freight; cargoes could have included some British Army vehicles and even the intact fuselage of some fighter aircraft that would fit into its fuselage. It would have also been able to carry large cargoes externally as an aerial crane, including vehicles and whole aircraft. According to some of the later proposals, the Rotodyne Z would have had a gross weight of 58,500 lb, an extended rotor diameter of 109 ft, and a tapered wing with a span of 75 ft.

However, the Tyne engines were also starting to appear under-powered for the larger design. The Ministry of Supply had pledged to finance 50 per cent of the development costs for both the Rotodyne Z and for the model of the Tyne engine to power it. Despite the strenuous efforts of Fairey to achieve its support, the expected order from the RAF did not materialise — at the time, the service had no particular interest in the design, being more focused on effectively addressing the issue of nuclear deterrence. As the trials continued, both the associated costs and the weight of the Rotodyne continued to climb; the noise issue continued to persist, although, according to Wood: &quot;there were signs that silencers would later reduce it to an acceptable level&quot;.

While the costs of development were shared half-and-half between Westland and the government, the firm determined that it would still need to contribute a further £9 million in order to complete development and achieve production-ready status. Following the issuing of a requested quotation to the British government for 18 production Rotodynes, 12 for the RAF and 6 for BEA, the government responded that no further support would be issued for the project, for economic reasons. Accordingly, on 26 February 1962, official funding for the Rotodyne was terminated in early 1962. The project&#x27;s final end came when BEA chose to decline placing its own order for the Rotodyne, principally because of its concerns regarding the high-profile tip-jet noise issue. The corporate management at Westland determined that further development of the Rotodyne towards production status would not be worth the investment required. Thus ended all work on the world&#x27;s first vertical take-off military/civil transport rotorcraft.

After the programme was terminated, the prototype Rotodyne itself, which was government property, was dismantled and largely destroyed in a fashion reminiscent of the Bristol Brabazon. A single fuselage bay, as pictured, plus rotors and rotorhead mast survived, and are on display at The Helicopter Museum, Weston-super-Mare.

=== Analysis ===

The one great criticism of the Rotodyne was the noise the tip jets made; however, the jets were only run at full power for a matter of minutes during departure and landing and, indeed, the test pilot Ron Gellatly made two flights over central London and several landings and departures at Battersea Heliport with no complaints being registered, though John Farley, chief test pilot of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier later commented:

There had been a noise-reduction programme in process which had managed to reduce the noise level from 113 dB to the desired level of 96 dB from 600 ft (180 m) away, less than the noise made by a London Underground train, and at the time of cancellation, silencers were under development, which would have reduced the noise even further — with 95 dB at 200 ft &quot;foreseen&quot;, the limitation being the noise created by the rotor itself. This effort, however, was insufficient for BEA which, as expressed by Chairman Sholto Douglas, &quot;would not purchase an aircraft that could not be operated due to noise&quot;, and the airline refused to order the Rotodyne, which in turn led to the collapse of the project.

It is only relatively recently that interest has been reestablished in direct city-to-city helicopter transport, with aircraft such as the AgustaWestland AW609 and the CarterCopter/PAV. The 2010 Eurocopter X3 experimental helicopter shares the general configuration of the Rotodyne, but is much smaller. A number of innovative gyrodyne designs are still being considered for future development.

== Design ==

The Fairey Rotodyne was a large hybrid rotorcraft termed compound gyroplane. According to Wood, it was &quot;the largest transport helicopter of its day&quot;. It featured an unobstructed rectangular fuselage, capable of seating between 40 and 50 passengers; a pair of double-clamshell doors were placed to the rear of the main cabin so that freight and even vehicles could be loaded and unloaded.

The Rotodyne had a large, four-bladed rotor and two Napier Eland N.E.L.3 turboprops, one mounted under each of the fixed wings. The rotor blades were a symmetrical aerofoil around a load-bearing spar. The aerofoil was made of steel and light alloy because of centre of gravity concerns. Equally, the spar was formed from a thick machined steel block to the fore and a lighter thinner section formed from folded and riveted steel to the rear. The compressed air was channelled through three steel tubes within the blade. The tip-jet combustion chambers were composed of Nimonic 80, complete with liners that were made from Nimonic 75.

For takeoff and landing, the rotor was driven by tip-jets. The air was produced by compressors driven through a clutch off the main engines. This was fed through ducting in the leading edge of the wings and up to the rotor head. Each engine supplied air for a pair of opposite rotors; the compressed air was mixed with fuel and burned. As a torqueless rotor system, no anti-torque correction system was required, though propeller pitch was controlled by the rudder pedals for low-speed yaw control. The propellers provided thrust for translational flight while the rotor autorotated. The cockpit controls included a cyclic and collective pitch lever, as in a conventional helicopter.

The transition between helicopter and autogyro modes of flight would have taken place around 60 mph, (other sources state that this would have occurred around 110 knots); the transition would have been accomplished by extinguishing the tip-jets. During autogyro flight, up to half of the rotocraft&#x27;s aerodynamic lift was provided by the wings, which also enabled it to attain higher speed.

<doc id="661351" wikidata="Q223013" url="?curid=661351" title="Hugh Falconer">
<text>Hugh Falconer MD FRS (29 February 1808 – 31 January 1865) was a Scottish geologist, botanist, palaeontologist, and paleoanthropologist. He studied the flora, fauna, and geology of India, Assam, Burma, and most of the Mediterranean islands and was the first to suggest the modern evolutionary theory of punctuated equilibrium. He studied the Siwalik fossil beds, and may also have been the first person to discover a fossil ape.

==Early life==

Falconer was the youngest son of David Falconer of Forres
, Elginshire. In 1826 Hugh Falconer graduated at the University of Aberdeen, where he studied natural history. Afterward, he studied medicine in the University of Edinburgh, taking the degree of MD in 1829. During this period he zealously attended the botanical classes of Prof. R. Graham (1786–1845), and those on geology by Prof. Robert Jameson, the teacher of Charles Darwin.

Falconer became an assistant-surgeon on the Bengal establishment of the British East India Company in 1830. Upon his arrival in Bengal he made an examination of the fossil bones from Ava, upper Burma in the possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. His description of the fossils, published soon afterward, gave him a recognized position among the scientists of India. Early in 1831 he was posted to the army station at Meerut, India, then in the North Western Provinces, and now in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

== Siwalik Hills ==

In 1832, Falconer became Superintendent of the Saharanpur botanical garden, India, succeeding John Royle. Falconer remained at Saharanpur until 1842, during which time he became widely known for his study of fossil mammals in the Siwalik Hills. 
Falconer and his associates may have made the first discovery of a fossil ape, in the 1830s in the Neogene deposits in the Siwalik Hills. In the Tertiary strata of the Siwalik Hills in 1831 Falconer discovered bones of crocodiles, tortoises and other animals. With others, he later brought to light a sub-tropical fossil fauna of unexampled extent and richness, including remains of &quot;Mastodon&quot;, the colossal ruminant &quot;Sivatherium&quot;, and the enormous extinct tortoise &quot;Colossochelys atlas&quot;. Falconer also published a geological description of the Siwálik Hills in 1834. For these valuable discoveries he and Proby Cautley (1802–1871) together received the Wollaston Medal from the Geological Society of London, its highest award, in 1837.

In 1834 Falconer was asked by a Commission of Bengal to investigate the commercial feasibility of growing tea in India. On his recommendation tea plants were introduced, and the resultant black tea became competitive with Chinese teas.

Falconer returned from India in 1842 because of ill health. He brought back 70 large chests of dried plants and 48 cases of fossils, bones and geological specimens. He then travelled throughout Europe making geological observations, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1845. Continuing in the service of the British East India Company as a naturalist, he pursued research at the British Museum and East India House and prepared casts of the most remarkable fossils for the leading museums of Europe.

== Calcutta ==

In 1847 Falconer became superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden and professor of botany in the Medical College, Calcutta, near his older brother, Alexander Falconer, a Calcutta merchant. Hugh Falconer served as an advisor to the Indian government and the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Bengal, the &quot;de facto&quot; colonial &quot;Department of Agriculture&quot;. He prepared an important report on the teak forests of Tenasserim, and this saved them from destruction by reckless felling. Through his recommendation, the cultivation of the cinchona in the Indian empire was introduced for the medicinal use of its bark in the treatment of malaria.

== Punctuated equilibrium ==

Falconer was originally a creationist who denied the fact of evolution. In November 1859, Charles Darwin sent Falconer a copy of his &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; with a letter which stated &quot;I am fully convinced that you will become, year after year, less fixed in your belief in the immutability of species&quot;. In June 1861, Falconer expressed respect in a letter to Darwin for receiving the book. By the early 1860s he reassessed his worldview and came to embrace evolution from his studies of the fossil record.

In 1863, Falconer authored a monograph &quot;On the American Fossil elephant of the regions bordering the Gulf of Mexico&quot;. A year before he had privately sent the work to Darwin who was delighted to read it. In the work he observed long periods of evolutionary stasis in fossil mammals with short periods of rapid evolutionary change throughout geological time. This research shows great foresight. Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed the same basic theory a century later, a theory known as punctuated equilibrium. According to Gould, the work &quot;anticipates a primary inference of punctuated equilibrium— that a local pattern of abrupt replacement does not signify macromutational transformation in situ, but an origin of the later species from an ancestral population living elsewhere, followed by migration into the local region.&quot;

== Later years ==

Having to leave India again in 1855 because of ill health, he spent the remainder of his life examining and comparing fossil species in England and the Continent to those he found in India, notably the species of mastodon, elephant, and rhinoceros. He also described some new mammalia from the Purbeck strata of Wessex. Turning to the subject of human origins, he reported on the bone caves of Sicily, Malta, Gibraltar, Gower, and Brixham. He discovered the dwarf elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon falconeri&quot; on Sicily and Malta, and also found the bones of the flightless giant swan &quot;Cygnus falconeri&quot; in Malta at Għar Dalam .

Falconer served as vice-president of the Royal Society 1863–1864. Although suffering from exposure and overwork, Falconer returned hastily from Gibraltar to support Charles Darwin&#x27;s claim to the Copley Medal in 1864. Falconer succumbed in London, England, on 31 January 1865 from rheumatic disease of the heart and lungs. He is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London.

The flower &quot;Rhododendron falconeri&quot; was named after Falconer by Joseph Dalton Hooker.

Falconer&#x27;s botanical notes, with 450 coloured drawings of Indian plants, were deposited in the library at Kew Gardens, together with some of the specimens he collected. A marble bust was placed in the rooms of the Royal Society of London, and another in the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta. A competitive Falconer scholarship of £100 per year was created for graduates in science or medicine of the University of Edinburgh.

The Falconer Museum in Forres, Scotland (), a &quot;Victorian Gem&quot;, houses, amongst numerous other collections, the many Falconer finds that had not been sent to other institutions like the library of Kew Gardens or the British Museum, including Palaeolithic finds that enable &quot;visitors of the Falconer Museum [to] look at three different species of humans at once, &quot;homo erectus, homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;homo sapiens&quot;&quot;.

<text>Birkirkara (abbreviated as B&#x27;Kara or BKR) is a city in the eastern region of Malta. It is the second most populous on the island, with 24,356 inhabitants as of 2020. The town consists of five autonomous parishes: Saint Helen, Saint Joseph the Worker, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Saint Mary and San Gorg Preca. The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;In hoc signo vinces&quot;, and its coat of arms is a plain red cross, surmounted by a crown.

==Etymology==

&quot;Birkirkara&quot; means &quot;cold water&quot; or &quot;running water&quot;. This is attributed to the valley in the town.

Originally, the name was written as &quot;Birchircara&quot;, as influenced by Italian spelling which traditionally does not use the letter &#x27;K&#x27;. It is often abbreviated as &quot;B&#x27;kara/Kara&quot;.

==Geography==
Birkirkara is situated in a valley, which is most likely where it gets its name from. It is known for flooding on heavy stormy days. Several projects have been proposed. The area has also received embellishment works from time to time.

== Climate ==
Birkirkara features a Csa Mediterranean climate under the Köppen climate classification. Birkirkara features mild, wet winters and dry hot summers. The city&#x27;s temperature varies from during the course of a year.

==Description==
Birkirkara is one of Malta&#x27;s oldest towns with a recorded mention in 1402 with The Cappella of Birkarkam which is understood to be an error for Birkirkara. It received mention in the 1436 Ecclesiastical Report mentioning the then existing parishes in Malta and Gozo, from which Birkirkara emerged as the largest parish. Various parishes and suburbs developed out of Birkirkara over the years, including Sliema, St. Julian&#x27;s, Msida, Ħamrun in the 19th century and Santa Venera in the early 20th century. In more recent years, San Ġwann (1965) and Ta&#x27; l-Ibraġ hived off Birkirkara to form part of the new parish and locality of Swieqi in 1993.

Birkirkara has grown into an important commercial centre as well as a densely populated residential area.

== Churches, architecture and notable places ==

=== Notable places ===

=== Churches ===
Birkirkara&#x27;s main religious feast is that of St Helen at St. Helen&#x27;s Basilica, which is celebrated on 18 August or on the first Sunday after that date. The main event of the celebration is a procession with a wooden statue carved by the Maltese master-sculptor Salvu Psaila. Notably, this is the only procession on the island carried out in the morning. The procession leaves the basilica at exactly 8:00 a.m. and returns to it at 10:45 am. The statue is lifted to shoulder-height by a group of townsmen through the main streets of the town.

* The Church of St. Joseph the Worker
* The Church of St. Mary
* The Church of San Gorg Preca
* The Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
* The Church of St Paul B&#x27;kara had a previous building on the same site likely to date back to around 1538. Its design was medieval with a slanting roof. The present building known as &quot;&#x27;San Pawl tal-Wied&quot;&#x27; was built in 1852 to 1854 on plans drawn up by Giuseppe Bonavia who was an architect with the Royal Engineers. The clock of the church was made by Michelangelo Sapiano in 1891. The titular painting by Giuseppe Calleja is a reproduction of the original found in the Tre Fontane Church in Rome.

The Church of Our Lady of Victories is a small church found within the narrow streets in the area known as &#x27;Has-Sajjied&#x27;. This church was known to have existed as far back as 1575. In the 17th century when the parish church was being built, this church was dismantled to allow easy access to the quarry that was supplying the stones needed. It was erected once again after the 1675–1676 Malta plague epidemic. The present church was built between 1728 and 1736 in the Baroque style. The internal pilasters follow the Tuscan style with the dome featuring floral motifs and emblems of the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary.

<text>The Gravettian was an archaeological industry of the European Upper Paleolithic that succeeded the Aurignacian circa 33,000 years BP. It is archaeologically the last European culture many consider unified, and had mostly disappeared by  22,000 BP, close to the Last Glacial Maximum, although some elements lasted until  17,000 BP. In Spain and France, it was succeeded by the Solutrean and by the Epigravettian in Italy, the Balkans, Ukraine and Russia.

The Gravettian culture is known for their artistic works including the famous Venus figurines, which were typically carved from either ivory or limestone. The culture was first identified at the site of La Gravette in the southwestern French department of Dordogne. While historically assumed to represent a genetically homogenous group, recent analysis of ancient DNA sequences suggests that the Gravettian was produced by multiple genetically divergent groups of hunter-gatherers. Eastern Gravettian-producing groups belong to the Věstonice cluster, while western Gravettian-producing groups belong to the Fournol cluster, both of which have genetic continuity from producers of the earlier Aurignacian. Fournol cluster-related groups are thought to be the ancestors of the producers of the following Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures present in Western Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum, while the producers of the Epigravettian are genetically distinct from Gravettian-producing groups.

==Gravettian culture==

The Gravettians were hunter-gatherers who lived in a bitterly cold period of European prehistory, and the Gravettian lifestyle was shaped by the climate. Pleniglacial environmental changes forced them to adapt. West and Central Europe were extremely cold during this period. Archaeologists usually describe two regional variants: the western Gravettian, known mainly from cave sites in France, Spain and Britain, and the eastern Gravettian in Central Europe and Russia. The eastern Gravettians, which include the Pavlovian culture, were specialized mammoth hunters, whose remains are usually found not in caves but in open air sites.

Gravettian culture thrived on their ability to hunt animals. They utilized a variety of tools and hunting strategies. Compared to theorized hunting techniques of Neanderthals and earlier human groups, Gravettian hunting culture appears much more mobile and complex. They lived in caves or semi-subterranean or rounded dwellings which were typically arranged in small &quot;villages&quot;. Gravettians are thought to have been innovative in the development of tools such as blunted-back knives, tanged arrowheads and boomerangs. Other innovations include the use of woven nets and oil lamps made of stone. Blades and bladelets were used to make decorations and bone tools from animal remains.

Gravettian culture extends across a large geographic region, as far as Estremadura in Portugal. but is relatively homogeneous until about 27,000 BP. They developed burial rites, which included simple, purpose-built offerings and/or personal ornaments owned by the deceased, placed within the grave or tomb. Surviving Gravettian art includes numerous cave paintings and small, portable Venus figurines made from clay or ivory, as well as jewelry objects. The fertility deities mostly date from the early period; there are over 100 known surviving examples. They conform to a very specific physical type, with large breasts, broad hips and prominent posteriors. The statuettes tend to lack facial details, and their limbs are often broken off.

During the post glacial period, evidence of the culture begins to disappear from northern Europe but was continued in areas around the Mediterranean.

The Mal&#x27;ta Culture () in Siberia is often considered as belonging to the Gravettian, due to its similar characteristics, particularly its Venus figurines, but any hypothetical connection would have to be cultural and not genetic: a 2016 genomic study showed that the Mal&#x27;ta people have no genetic connections with the people of the European Gravettian culture (the Vestonice Cluster).

==Diet==

Animals were a primary food source for humans of the Gravettian period. Since Europe was extremely cold during this period, they preferred food sources high in energy and fat content. Testing comparisons among various human remains reveal that populations at higher latitudes placed greater dietary emphasis on meat. A defining trait distinguishing Gravettian people was their ease of mobility compared to their Neanderthal counterparts. Modern humans developed the technology and social organization that enabled them to migrate with their food source whereas Neanderthals were not adept at travelling, even with relatively sedentary herds.

With their ability to move with the herds, Gravettian diets incorporated a broad variety of animal prey. Gravettian diet included larger animals such as mammoths, hyenas, wolves, and reindeer killed with stone or bone tools, as well as hares and foxes captured with nets. This time period is classified by the strong emphasis on meat consumption because agriculture had not been fully introduced nor utilized. In addition, the climate was not favorable to stable crop cultivation.

Seafood accounted for a significant portion of coastal Gravettians&#x27; diet. From remains found in Italy and Wales, isotope analysis reveals that 20–30% of Gravettian diets of coastal peoples consisted of sea animals. Populations of lower latitudes relied more on shellfish and fish while higher latitudes&#x27; diets consisted of seals.

==Physical type==

Physical remains of people of the Gravettian have revealed that they were tall and relatively slender people. The male height of the Gravettian culture ranged between tall with an average of , which is exceptionally tall not only for that period of prehistory, but for all periods of history.

They were fairly slender and normally weighed between , although they would likely have had a higher ratio of lean muscle mass compared to body fat in comparison to modern humans as a result of a very physically active and demanding lifestyle. The females of the Gravettian were much shorter, standing on average, with an average weight of . Examinations of Gravettian skulls reveal that high cheekbones were common among them.

==Hunting==

Clubs, stones and sticks were the primary hunting tools during the Upper Paleolithic period. Bone, antler and ivory points have all been found at sites in France; but proper stone arrowheads and throwing spears did not appear until the Solutrean period (~20,000 Before Present). Due to the primitive tools, many animals were hunted at close range. The typical artefact of Gravettian industry, once considered diagnostic, is the small pointed blade with a straight blunt back. They are today known as the Gravette point, and were used to hunt big game. Gravettians used nets to hunt small game, and are credited with inventing the bow and arrow.

Gravettian settlers tended towards the valleys that pooled migrating prey. Examples found through discoveries in Gr. La Gala, a site in Southern Italy, show a strategic settlement based in a small valley. As the settlers became more aware of the migration patterns of animals like red deer, they learned to prey herd in valleys, thereby allowing the hunters to avoid travelling long distances for food. Specifically in Gr. La Gala, the glacial topography forced the deer to pass through the areas in the valley occupied by humans. Additional evidence of strategically positioned settlements include sites like Klithi in Greece, also placed to intercept migrating prey.

Discoveries in the Czech Republic suggest that nets were used to capture large numbers of smaller prey, offering a quick and consistent food supply and thus an alternative to the feast/famine pattern of large game hunters. Evidence comes in the form of thick rope preserved on clay imprints. Research suggests that although no larger net imprints have been discovered, there would be little reason for them not to be made as no further knowledge would be required for their creation. The weaving of nets was likely a communal task, relying on the work of both women and children.

==Use of animal remains==
===Decorations and tools===

The Gravettian era landscape is most closely related to the landscape of present-day Moravia. Pavlov I in southern Moravia is the most complete and complex Gravettian site to date, and a perfect model for a general understanding of Gravettian culture. In many instances, animal remains indicate both decorative and utilitarian purposes. In the case of, for example, Arctic foxes, incisors and canines were used for decoration, while their humeri and radii bones were used as tools. Similarly, the skeletons of some red foxes contain decorative incisors and canines as well as ulnas used for awls and barbs.

Some animal bones were only used to create tools. Due to their shape, the ribs, fibulas, and metapodia of horses were good for awl and barb creation. In addition, the ribs were also implemented to create different types of smoothers for pelt preparation. The shapes of hare bones are also unique, and as a result, the ulnas were commonly used as awls and barbs. Reindeer antlers, ulnas, ribs, tibias and teeth were utilised in addition to a rare documented case of a phalanx. Mammoth remnants are among the most common bone remnants of the culture, while long bones and molars are also documented. Some mammoth bones were used for decorative purposes. Wolf remains were often used for tool production and decoration.

==Genetics==
Fu et al. (2016) examined the remains of fourteen Gravettians. The eight males included three samples of Y-chromosomal haplogroup CT, one of I, one IJK, one BT, one C1a2, and one sample of F. Of the fourteen samples of mtDNA, there were thirteen samples of U and one sample of M. The majority of the sample of U belonged to the U5 and U2.
Teschler et al. (2020) examined the remains of one adult male and two twin boys from a Gravettian site in Austria. All belonged to haplogroup Y-Haplogroup I. and all had the same mtDNA, U5. According to Scorrano et al. (2022), &quot;the genome of an early European individual from Kostenki 14, dated to around 37,000 years ago, demonstrated that the ancestral European gene pool was already established by that time.&quot;

A 2023 study found that Gravettian-producing peoples belonged to two genetically distinct clusters. Fournol in the west (France and Spain) and Věstonice in the east (Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, and Italy) both of whom traced their descent from producers of the earlier Aurignacian culture. Some individuals showed mixed ancestry from both clusters where the range of the two clusters bordered. The study found that members of the western Fournol cluster were ancestral to later Western European Cro-Magnon groups that existed after the Last Glacial Maximum, the producers of the Solutrean and Magdalenian cultures. All Gravettian-producing peoples are strongly genetically distinct from the producers of the later Epigravettian, who are genetically referred to as the Villabruna cluster, who show a greater affinity to ancient and modern peoples in West Asia than other Palaeolithic European hunter-gatherer groups. There is evidence of some genetic affinity between the Villabruna and Věstonice clusters, which may reflect shared common ancestry from the Balkans region.
